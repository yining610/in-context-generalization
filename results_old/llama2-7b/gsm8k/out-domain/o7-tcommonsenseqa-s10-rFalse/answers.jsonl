[Subtracted half of the original seashells.](50-180) = 130 2. [Both of one half and remained are subtracted.](99-58) = 41 3.

Now he had only 140 seashells.\n\nHe sold half of them and he ended up with 30 seashelles.\n\nNow 30 + 140 = 170, so he now has 170 seashells left.\n\nHe gave 30 of them to his friends.\n\nNow they had 170 - 40 - 30 = 50 seashells to give to friends.\n\nSo, if they actually gave 30 seahells to their friends, then he must have 20 seahells remaining.\n\n### Input:-10 people bought a total of 122 shirts and gave 20 of them to his neighbor.

{"text": "Susie has 40% more money in her piggy.\n\n#### Comment\nSusie started with total of $200. She now has $240 more, so she has a total of $440. She has 200 more money, which is 100 more than her original amount. So 200% of $200 is $240.\n\nThe next question is how much she put in. Let us call this A. Next, we are told Susie should 80% of A to get B. Now we are told Susie has C. So, Susie have total of $B+C=$440+440. Now I need Susies piggy bank's growth. I can get that by subtracting Susie's original amount from the amount she have. I get 440 - 200 = 240. Now I must find 240% of A which is, you guessed it, 240. So Susie's piggy bank has 240%/80% of her original amount. I have two expressions I can solve; 240%//80%, and 80% of 240%. Remember I am looking for B which is 80% of her growth. Her growth is 160% of A, but I have to subtract off the growth I already know, which is 80%. That is why I am looking for 80% of the growth. I write those as equations like 160% - 80% = 80 = 80% of B. So my final equation is 80/4 = A. Now that I have final value of A, I can substitute back into my original question, $A/100 = $200. This is true because every unit of money she put into her piggy is ten times as much as the original money. So her 200% is twice as much as her original amount. So her entire amount must be twice as large. Now I can divide both sides by two then I have $1/2= $100. This means Susie put in $50 which is 50% of her original piggy bank.", "answer": " 240"}

To know the length of playing time for soccer, find **Time** and put **20** at the _x_ variable. Then, _x_ equals **90** and **20**, to find the answer, you will need to solve **20 = 90 - X.** So, 90 **-** 20 is equivalent to 70. Then, **X = 70**.\n2.  To know the sideline length after subtracting playing time, find **Time**, to find it, replace **x** with the **20** that was done in the first hint.

{"text": "400\n\n### Comment:\nThe problem asks for the amount of money each winner earns from fourth place onwards. We will need to think about the sum of 18 amounts of money.\n\nAs it is the amount of prizes each winner will earn, we can start by thinking about the sum of the 18 numbers 1, 2, 3,..., 18. Note that 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus... plus 18 equals 655, which is not correct.\n\nWe find that instead of adding 1 plus 2 then 1 plus 2, each amount that we add has to follow two rules.\nThe first rule is that if the numbers starts with one, the numbers will be twice the number that is in the same position before it.\nThe second rule is that if the number starts with an even number, the numbers will be equal to half the amount that is in the second position before it.\n\nThen we find that after one plus two, plus 1, plus 2 plus 1, plus......, plus 18 we will see that each position has a different number.\n\nFor instance, after 655, the number in the first position is 19. Then after 265, the number in first position is 179 (19 times 2). And so on until we reach 655 (265 times 2).\n\nThis means that we will always add an odd number (the number in the first position times 2) to the sum that we started with before. Then we have to multiply 1 by 4, because each position on the string is twice as many.\n\nThen after 4 multiplied by 4, we double the last two positions, so that 4 becomes 16.\n\nSo the formula that we will have to use for the summation will be: (First Position Number)*2*16.\n\nThere is a total of 18 positions in the string. As for each position the first number is always 1, there will 18 sums of 1 and 18 sums of two.\n\nThere are 18 sums of one, so there will be 18 sums of (1)*2*16 = 288.", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "The bus carried 360 passengers on that day, therefore, 4/5 + 3/4 = 45/5 = 9 vehicles, thus, 120 passengers.\n\n### Reasoning: The first calculation gives you 3/4 of the total population that could fit on the bus. You then are taking that amount times two and adding it, in this case 150 people. Then you take that amount times five or 75 people. You then take those last 75 people times four, so in total it is 190/4 or 47.5, you then double that, so 95 and add 95 and then take that number times 1 35 vehicles. That gives you a total of 120 people.\n\n### Explanation to response: Since a bus can carry 200 people all in total on a single day, and then it transported 3/4 of that total or 150 people to city B, leaving them with 60 people to bring back to city A. Then the bus transports 4/5 of that total which is 45 people, leaving them with 15 people to bring back to City A. Therefore, 2/3 of these people had to get on the bus at City A, and 1/3 had to get on the other bus at city B. Therefore, 75/3 people had to get on that bus originally and 42.5 people got on the other bus to equal 120 total people on the bus.\n\n### Output: A bus has a capacity of of 300 people. If 170 people from city A boarded first and 175 people boarded 5 minutes and 30 seconds later from city B, by what percentage did bus travel time increase? If bus travel time increases, then what does the bus need more of?\n\n### Reasons: We know how many people ride on the bus from city A to city b and how many from city B to city A, we need to find the extra travel time. 375 / (230 x 120) = 17.5%\n\n### Demonsration:\n375 vehicles / (230 (1/3) x 120", "answer": " 310"}

The \u201cInput\u201d represents the inputs that are expected in a task. For a task with user input, the input is typically a command, a question, or a request. For example, the instruction below, \u201cClick on a cell,\u201d is an example of a user input in a task.\n\n\u201cClick on a cell.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cAnswer\u201d represents the expected outputs from a task. For a step where user output will occur, the answer provided is a placeholder for a user-entered response. For example, the following tasks provide the same output with different inputs:\n\nQuestion A to Question C - How many people work in this office?\n\nThe table below provides some examples and how they correspond to the Input - Answer Map diagram that depicts a \u201ctask\u201d in BPMN.\n\n**Table: Input - Answer Map**\n\n| **Input** |  | **Answer** |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| The person put on loton | The Answer is E: burned the record\n| The person put lotion on | The Answer is C: smooth skin\n| What would you need oil for? | The Answer is D: combustion engine\n| The person put oil in | The Answer is C. smooth skin\n\n**Example: How many people work in a small office?**\n\nIn the above example, the output \u201cHow many people work in this ofice?\u201d and the output \u201cThe answer is 5,\u201d both are examples of the same answer. The only difference is that one is an answer from a question the other is an answer to a question.

{"text": "The answer to the question is 120 students. By considering the question a bit, you\u2019ll discover that there are 50 desks available, so at least 50 students will not have their own desks.\n\nThere are multiple ways to find the answer to this question.\n\nAnswer Example 1:\n\nYou can work this answer out by hand. The first thing to do is find the total number of students in the school, which is 25+15, therefore 40.\n\nThe next step is to work out which classrooms have 35 students and then subtract that number from 40. There are 5 classrooms that have that many students, so we can say the answer is 40 - 5, or 35 students.\n\nAnswer Example #2:\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of arithmetic, you can use a table format and simply count how many students there are for each group.\n\nWe can split the students into the groups without the total, which will give us 225 (15 x 30) - 150 (15 x 20), or 75.\n\nThis gives us our final answer of 75 students that don\u2019t have their own desks, which brings the total of students in the school down to 225 - 75, or 150.\n\nAnswer Example:\n\nHere are some examples of calculations you can use to find the same answer, in the event that you don\u2019t want to count by hand or make a table.\n\n(25+15)*30 = 750, so if there are 30 desks (which is the lower number), that leaves an extra 150 students for each group.", "answer": " 400"}

For a student: \n    * The student enters a string to be parsed that is either a unit(ex: lb ounce), a number, or a unit (ex: 2oz), and is asked to parse the string into two values: a unit value and a number value. A unit is either \"lb\" or \"oz\". \n    * To parse, the string is converted to letters, and the space between the units and values are removed to create a list of numbers (ex: lb ounce). The units and values are then used to search for them in the dictionary to convert the strings into numbers and units respectively. \n\n2. For a store: \n    * Customers enter a string to be parsed in the form of their \"pick up time\", for example, 10:00 AM, 7:06 AM, and so on.  \n    * The store's stock room is closed 30 minutes after the last employee clocked out. The employee's shift ends at 4:00 PM and the store's \"pick up time\" closes at 6:00 PM. The store uses the number as a constraint in the form of a timer to make sure customers are given enough time to pick up their items. If the customer's pick up time is not within the range of the store's operating time, the shop sends the customer a message that its open hours is over. \n        * To parse, the user enters a string. The user is asked to enter the number 1 for when the store starts to operate, any \"time range\" could have the values of 4:00 to 6:30. \n        * The user is also asked to enter the \"closing timer\" 30, which is an indicator of the number of minutes the employee's closing.  \n    * After 6:30 PM, the store is closed. \n        * After hours, the number 5, which is an indicator that the time is outside the store's operating hours, is assigned to a variable and returned to the user.", "answer": " 10"}

Now if the parent caught 3 times much more than the child there are 15 trouts left and dad caught 10 so we know there are 5 trouts left on the  which means that dad caught 5 more.

Therefore there are a total of 6 trouts so:\n\n16 = 3 * 2  + 5 \n\nNow in order to find the answer we must figure out 5 more which is 15 so now we do \n\n16 =  3 * 2 + 5 + 15  \n\nSo the answer is the parent caught 15 trouts.\n\n\n### Instructions:Which statement does not accurately describe a number line?\nAnswer: d) \"a number line can be used to help us solve addition and subtraction.\"\n\n### Instructor:In 838,000,000 years the moon will not be in sync with Earth.

In an email from the professor, he asked for a 2-page double spaced letter to the editor of The New York Times that expresses a position on the topic of building low cost housing for the poor.  Select the student letter that does not have a letter grade attached next to their paragraph.  \n\nIn the paper, I asked four different groups of people the following question: Should governments have incentives to build low-cost housing for the poor?  \n\nThe first group I asked was residents of a housing project located downtown.  Two-thirds of them believed that the government should not provide subsidized housing, and that housing projects should not even be allowed in the city.  Most of the homes were unfit to live in.  Some homes had no furnace and heat was provided by radiators.  The heaters created 99 percent humidity.  People said that they didn\u2019t mind living without heat, but it was the mold and the sewage that gave them problems.  Two of the tenants had children and they were concerned about the children catching pneumonia in winter when it was so cold in the apartments.  The rest of the renters complained about the noise.  Some of the tenants held social clubs at night, many were into drugs, or lived in fear of becoming victims.  \n\nThe second group I spoke with was property owners that lived in the neighborhood.  Many of them said it was impossible to sell their homes due to the location and the people living there.  One of the more vocal homeowners was a lawyer who also served on the city council.  After we spoke, I learned that the city had recently adopted a program of housing down payment loans.  With the loans, homeowners could pay back the loans at a low interest rate.

Just ask for what he wants, then leave him to it.\n\n### A customer comes in at 10:32am. Do you have a question or need a product?\nIn the first question, a customer comes in at 5 minutes after the opening time.  At a store, you'd just say \"can I help you?\" and then the customer says, \"yes, I'm looking for XYZ widget.\"  In that time, the customer could have found the widget him/herself and ask me to take their money.  In any customer service industry, be quick to help the customer and don't be asking too many questions.\n\n### How to tell if they're joking?\nIt depends on the customer service field.  When we were in a customer service call center, I'd answer the phone and say, \"Hello, thank you for calling 10 digit company.  We'd like to help you with that.\"  A customer would then tell me that he'd lost his job or he's having family problems or other issues that we couldn't help with.  Then I'd tell him to get an appointment with his HR department so I could assist him with my company's resources and then hang up the phone.  That's when the customer would say, \"Okay, you win!\"  They'd then call their HR for their first appointment.\n\nWhen a customer is calling into a call center, I feel that they're not so much looking for help but getting something off their chest.  That's what I usually try to do when someone comes to me at my job.\n\n### Do we do well in training?\nSometimes yes.", "answer": " 14"}

The first half of the number will always equal the second half, so when u divide by 2 you just have to subtract 57 from 117. The second half is (57/2)+(34/2)=57+7=6.

{"text": "The answer is 54 ounces.  First, I'll put up the problem again for reference, and then I can go step by step through how I would solve this problem.\n\n### Answer:\nIn the initial question, there are different rates of water leaks per minute from the three holes.  The largest hole takes exactly one hour to reach its maximum leakage rate.  I will call this rate a, the medium-sized takes another hour to reach its maximum, I'll call that b, and the smallest only takes half of an hour to reach its peak flow rate of c.  \n\nThen in the last question of the problem, the given 2-hour time span to solve for the amount of water in total that is leaked into the house.\n\nSince the three leak rates don't sum up to the 54oz. given in the problem,  I can use the formula to determine that the 54oz is equal to the amount of time in hours to solve for the answer.\n```\n  a + b + c\n  + a + b + c \n  + a +b + c \n  = 2 \n```\nSo we know that\n```\na + b + c + a \n  + b + c  + a \n  = 3\n```\nand this equation is true only if a + b + c = 3 and the last equation is true too, because a + b + c + 5 = 2.\nIf we simplify the second equation,\n```\n\n```\nThen we get\n```\n```\nThus we know that the amount of time in total from all three leak rates equals 54/18. This simplifies to\n```\n```\n```\nand using the formula\n```\n```\nWe need to make sure that the problem is true for our solution first.\nThus,\n```\n```\ngiving us our answer for the amount of water.  In total, each hole leaks 1.5oz (3/2) over the given amount of time (2hours).\nSo the total leakage amount per the entire problem is\n```\n```\n### Output: The answer is 72.", "answer": " 600"}

She wants to make candy-canes but doesn't like the cost (7candy per).  The teacher also wants to make gifts for any children that don't like candies, so she knows that for every candycane that she makes, she'll need to make extra presents to give to the picky children.  The teacher's store sells premade gifts (in packs) for $5 each and has an option to custom-make gifts for $7 each.  How much money can the teacher save if she custom makes her gifts instead of buying them from the store?\n\n### Solution:\nThe only solution to this is to be buying the gift from the store because you know everyone wants candy cane, so all you have to buy is 7 gifts because you just won't need to buy anything from the gift because you will making it.  You'll have 7 gifts to give out, so make 7 candy canes, that is for 19 gifts.  Then you have to give a gift that people don't want, so make a gift with a value less and than 7 candy cane.\n\n> So if you buy a pack of 6 gifts because you are a good teacher and want your students to be happy, then make a \"gift\" that is cheaper than a candy cane with a cost of about 2$\n\n> 6x5=30candy\n\n> 6+13=20gift, so you'll buy two packs and get a gift.\n\n> So you'll make up the other students with other gift so you would spend 25+28=53$ on total for your bags.\n\n> So the least amount of money she can spend is the 53$.\n\n### Input (4): An elementary school teacher has noticed that some of her students' math assignments always come with the wrong answer to the given equation.

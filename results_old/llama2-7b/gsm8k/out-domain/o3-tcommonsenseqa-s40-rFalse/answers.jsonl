Love is a feeling of appreciation for our associates and others and it causes us to be kind to them. The best kind of love is expressed in actions. Courtesy is important. Courtesy is showing politeness to others. Some examples of courtesy are being attentive to what others say, having a ready reply for people or their ideas, and listening carefully to instructions. Careful consideration is another important trait to learn about love. Consideration for others means that one tries to make people happy, helps others when they are in difficulties, and takes no advantage of them.

The pear bag cost $1.25 for the first 6, and then another $1.25 every 6 after that.  The pineapples were $2 apiece and the plums were $6.69 for the small basket.\n\n\t(b) Count how much she paid for the produce that remained in the bag.\n\n\t\tBased on the way she bought groceries, it's clear that she didn't buy produce in whole numbers.  That's not how she bought the pears, apples, pineapples, or even the plums.  In this case, her bag is a variable quantity.  So, the only way to be absolutely sure how many plums she bought is to calculate how many pounds are left in the bag that contained her plums.\n\n\t(c) Subtract the number of pounds the bag contains from the quantity she pays for that produce.\n\n\t\tLet's assume she bought as much plum as the smallest possible fruit: a pear.  Since she bought 6 pears originally, she ended up paying $6 for that and $6.69 per pound more for the plums.\n\n2. Multiplication, which includes describing what each choice of choices includes.\n\n\t(d) Multiply the total cost of the produce left in the bag by what number.\n\n\t\tIn the situation being considered here, the number of pounds of fruit per pound of bag is 1.

It taught me a lot about syntax rules and writing skills, which I feel like will be crucial for my future career. \n\n> If you had more time, what more could you have done:\nI think that if I had more time it would have been interesting to see better results. Writing more clearly and with better grammar could potentially yield more readable answers for the reader. I feel like this task could be modified and even be used for learning purposes, like for grade schoolers.

{"text": "A21\n\n### Explanation:Let's take one compartment with pennies and add 6 more pennys to each compartment for n times. The new and old pennies in each compartment respectively are: p1 + (p n) - p n (1) and (p1 + p n) - p n. The 1st,2nd, and 3rd equation of each side are respectively: p24 - 1 = 1 - p25 - 54 = 1 - -65 = 66 and p36 - 1 = 80 = p 37- 1 =69 and p1 - 1= 1- p2- 5 = 1- -6 = 7.  We get each side as p6 and p7 respectively. So to get the total number of pennis in each compartment, we add up all those number for all the compartments in the bank and the total will be n times of p6 + p7,which will be n times of 7+6. The total will be 7 + 6*n.\n\n## Scenario 2\n\n**Brian's class needs to purchase some textbooks.

When I see that the answer is not immediately obvious,I keep at it until I know what was done.  Using that process,I see now that there are not 120 bottles of wine left at the party.  I first figured that there were 120 bottle at the party because there was 2400 imported wines and 120 is 30% of 4200 because 4200 is 4x 1050.  Then I realized that I was doing 1 bottle at a time instead of 1 case at a time.  So after taking 120 bottlers of imported wine, I would need to use 120 empty bottles. I then subtracted 2400 from 2400 because I did not leave any imported wine in the cellar, and the number goes from 120 to 72.  Then I figured that 1/8 of the imported wine was used and that I would not need to use any of the imported wine left in the cellar.  So I would have 2x 120 cases of domestic wine and 3x 120 of imported wine used.  So I have 360 bottles at a party from 2404 bottles, leaving 1844 at my cellar.", "answer": " 2400"}

{"text": "29 or 30\n\n### Response Explanation:\nFrom the instruction, we are told that Tyler has 21CDs. We are then told that he gives away a third of them. If he gives away a third, that means to the denominator, (the part over 1) 3. This is a third of the whole original amount. So if we have 21, we now have 13. He goes to the music store then, and buys 8 new CDs. This means that in the denominator, we now have 8. If we still have 13, we should simply add the new amount to the denominator. So, when we put the numbers together, we get 21+8. 29. This also tells us that if he did not go to the music store, he would have had 30 CDs. And if he did not give away a third, he would have gone to the music store and would have had 33 CDs (5=1/3, and adding the new amount, 8).", "answer": " 22"}

We can approximate 11.67 hours because 11.656666 is a close number, meaning it is almost one-tenth of a day shorter. A quarter of a day is also 15 minutes in our example, meaning that 16 minutes shy of 12 hours is about one-tenth of one day.\n\n### Solution 2:\nA total of 700 minutes (or 11.6 hours) were needed to produce 90 coffee cake. Because the time it takes to make a coffee cake changes depending on the number the cakes Matthew is producing that day, we cannot directly use 700 as the answer to this problem. We do need to find the time for each of the days, so we can add them together to get a sum equal to 700. Since adding times to get a sum is the same thing as multiplying a time by a quantity, we need to multiply by 15. The time it takes Matthew to make a coffee cakes, in minutes, is the same with 15 minutes off.\n\n\n### Input\nIt took Matthew 10 minutes to make 1 coffee cake;\n\nIt took Matthew 20 minutes to make 2 coffee cakes;\n\nIt took Matter 30 minutes to make 3 coffee cakes;\n...\n\nIt took Matty 90 minutes to make 90 cakes.\n\n### Output\nMatthew needed a total of 13.1 hours to produce the 91 coffee cakes and cakes and the time it took Matthew to make cakes on each of the days, in minutes, is:\n\n10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 9", "answer": " 5"}

This means that he can go swimming six days a week for 228 days each year and he will never need to go more than six times in a year because he will always have a free day. There are many days in a year when he cannot go swimming at all, and he will never be able to swim more times in a year than those days without missing a day. So, James can go swimming 6 days (112 days) each year. \nBy analogy, Katie can go skiing 20 days (365 x 20 / 7 = 21) each year. Therefore, James goes swimming six times more often than Katie goes skiing.  \n\n**\n\nComment: Hello, Welcome to Stack Overflow!

{"text": "Input:   Paityn has 30 red hats and Zola has 44 blue hats. (I'm going to use this for my example)\n\n### Response\n  If they combine all the hat together, it's not clear which one gets which.\n\n  The question states they \"share\" the hats evenly between themselves. We aren't sure if that means they have to pick the same hats or if the hats they pick are all divided in half.\n\n  If Paityn has 4/5 the hats that Zola has, then it's fairly obvious that she's going to have more hats than Zola.\n\n  Therefor, if they combine 30 red hts and 44 Blue hats and divide them in half, Zola (being the one who has the least amount of hats) would receive a quarter of 90 hats, which is 22.5, and Paityn would receive 17.5.\n\n      Total: Zola 22.5\n        Paityn 17.5\n\n### Reference:\n\n* https://practice.geekinterview.com/coding-quiz-1773993570", "answer": " 54"}

A reliable car can help a person to stay ahead in the rat race.  The first part of staying ahead is to have a car that can start, and one that you can trust when you get to where you're going.  I didn't worry about how dependable the car was until I was in an accident.  It took me five and a half hours to get the car fixed - I had to take it 24 miles away.  I'm glad that I got lucky and had a reliable car that saved me from that 12-hour trip.\n\n### Response\n\n    I did as you said.  You should feel relieved when I tell you that I chose the right car.  The reliable car you described is perfect for me.  I can drive in safety with a dependable vehicle.  My car will start, and if it doesn't I have someone to rely on when I get to the garage.  You warned me to stay safe.  I listened.  My car started.  That was the right choice.\n\n#### Response for all four instructions\n\nWe're glad you took our advice.  You were right to listen.

There's a ball mark (which is where a person stands to aim a bocce ball), another ball mark, and point. The player on this side throws first, followed by the second player, third, and fourth. Then, this process is followed once again. For the game to start, the ball mark must be on this side of the center line. The point must be on the opposite side (for example, on the opponent's side). The player that throws throws two bocce balls. The player must land the ball between the point and the closest ball mark. Thereafter, the players throw the ball, alternating sides. The ball cannot touch or be thrown past the line in between the balls or the player will receive a penalty. Once one ball is out of play, a player may not throw another ball until the previous ball is completely out the playing arena. Each player may only use two balls total during his or her turn.

{"text": "The salad has 220 calories.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe salad has 720 calories. Calories are units of energy. One calorie is the amount needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree Celsius. Salad is mostly plant material but has only one gram of protein in it. The 30 calories of lettuce have 3.5 g protein. The 80 calories of cucumber have 9.8 g protein. The 20 calories of each crouton have 6 g proteins. The 20 protein g each crouton has only one gram of fat. There are a total of 89.8 g protein in the salad. 89.8 calories come from protein. A gram of protein has 4 calories. The 29 protein calories x 1 gram x 4 calories/g protein equals 116 calories. You get the total calories of 216 calories.

As a starting point, it's important to keep track of what we have observed to the end.  It's not necessary to memorize information, but, what we put into our memory is to be saved to the end of everything we do. You must remember how many times you have observed the number of things, not as a number stored in a variable, but a count of how many.  We have noticed that there are 16 people.  The first task is to determine how many of the dinner rolls were left.  We can divide by how many people, and then we are left with how much each person ate.  I would say that this type of example is a good one to make use of counting on a stack and dividing. Remember our counting is based on the number rather than the people. In this case, we can make a list of all the people, then divide by how many there will be, adding the leftover to the list once more.", "answer": " 24"}

The idea is, by putting together the most suitable food pairs, you could reduce the amount of food required to meet the daily requirements. There will be a test to determine their accuracy.  You have been chosen to participate in the test; below is the first question and its answer.\n\n### Problem: The following are the combinations tested by the researchers.\n\n1.  Cereal and juice for breakfast\n\n2.  Cereal, soup and steak for lunch\n\n3.  Ice cream, pizza and beans for dinner\n\n4.  Cereal with no beans at all\n\nIn order to determine the scientific validity of their research, the first question asked is: \n\n\tWhich combination is the one with the highest amount of proteins?\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe answer is that Cereal and juices are the combination that has the highest amount of proteine. I never knew that was possible but I don't have any opinion on why cereal can get away with not having no beans.

Last summer, a theater in New York City was selling a movie ticket for $15.75. Two months later, the same theater was selling tickets for $10.75. This month, the same theater is now selling a movie ticket to see a popular documentary for $13.50. Use the price comparison table, and all the facts given, to predict the lowest and highest movie tickets sold at the theater in the months you see listed.`\n\n### Response\n\n```\nIf it changes 15.75 - 10.75 = 5 to 25 for one month, it follows that for 1 month it will be 0.25 or 25%. So there should be 2.5 dollars difference from last time the price was the same. We should use the information below to finish\nInput: If it changes 10.70 - 7.50 = 3.2 = 1 month, it follows that\nInput: $15.70 * (1 - 0.25) =$12.8750  and $10.70 * ( 1 - 0.75) =$ 7.4750\n\nIf I set both as a fraction, that is, 7.47/12.87...\n\nAnswer: $12.5/10=$12.8700 - $7.4700+ 2.5,so if he was charging 15.70- 2.5= 13.17/10 = 13.07...\n```\n\n## What type of task did you create for this activity?", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "The  minimum number of rides that you would need to take every month when buying a 30-day-pass for 50 dollars, than the one way ticket costing 5 times as much, would have to be at least the cost of the 50 dollar ticket. This is because the ticket costs $2 and so the cost of the trip has to be more than $2 in order to come out to more than $50 since the cost of a ticket is 2 and a 30 day pass is 50. This can be shown by taking the 50 dollers and deducting 2 from it. This leaves 48. Subtract that from $2 and you get 46. The number of rides that we need to take will have to be more than 21, since $21 is a part of 46 and we subtracted that from the 50 dollars leaving us to the number of $46. So 21/2 comes out to 22.5, but no fraction, so we round up to 23.", "answer": " 26"}

{"text": "The class contains 30 students. To sleep comfortably, each student must have his or her own twin bed. Thus the class must be broken up into groups of 10. One group has 10 members, as does a second group. This leaves four students who must share one double bed.

To help me memorize the multiplication table, my teacher tells me to \"Practice, practice, practice.\" What's \"practice\" in this sentence? I've learned that \"practice\" with a capital \"P\" is a noun that refers to a repetitive act (\"I'll try to practice my math this afternoon\"). But when \"Practice, Practice, Practice\" appears in this sentence, \"Practice\" is not a noun. So I cannot substitute \"Practice\" for the underlined word, because this would require changing from a noun to a verb or preposition (\"the underlined word should be 'praxice', because that's the verb form of noun 'practice').\n\n### John's wife was surprised as she learned of the money", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "#### The input above describes a contextually organized task that provides enough information to answer.\n\nThe baking contest consists of three types of cakes: the unicorn cakes, the witch cakes, and the dragon cakes. Each type of cake had a number of votes, and the unicorn caks garnered three times more votes than the combined number for the witch cakes and dragon cakes. However, I had the problem of determining the number of votes in total. Since there is no reference or definition in the problem that identifies any type of cake as a winner, there is no reason to calculate all the votes in total. Instead of relying on all the votes, the question is contextually ordered in a way that only requires the number of votes from individuals who voted for the unicrown cake and the number of votes casted for the witch cak.e\n\nTo compute the total number of votes casted, I first had to calculate the number of votes for each type of cake.\n\nThe number of voters should be 7 since that is the number of voters given in the problem. I will use $7$ as the number of votes for voting totals.\n\nUsing all the given information:\n\n$$\\begin{align} &\\text{number of votes} \\\\ & \\text{Total number of cakes} \\\\ & \\text{\\# of votes casted for unicrown cake} \\\\ & \\text{{\\# of votes casted witch cake} \\\\ & 3 + 25 \\\\ & 7-3 \\\\ & 7 \\end {align}$$\n\nIn sum, the total number of votes for the unicorn and witch cakes was equal and together they contributed the number of votes that the unicorn cak garnered.  So, I subtracted the number of votes for two cakes from the number of votes for one cake.\n\n$$\\therefore \\\\ 7-25+3 \\\\ = 17-25+8= \\\\ 11$$\n\n#### Therefore, the number of votes total for the unicork cake and for the witch caks was equal and together they garnered thirteen votes.

The following quote from Leonardo summarizes the concept of his famous image: In his image \u201cThe Holy Family\" he painted Mary, Jesus, and John, standing before a barren tree, a symbol of John the Baptist. The image has a religious meaning, but it also evokes many secular meanings. The tree is a symbol of a wilderness; the barren tree is a metaphor for a wilderness; an untamed, uncultivated land. The image is a symbol representing a struggle between the human spirit, the need to develop, and the urge to destroy.\n\n### Input\n\nLeonard created a variety of objects.

{"text": "Matt needs to buy 23 plates, so he can accommodate everyone comfortably and not be scrambling every Saturday night to do more.  With this in mind, it is not hard to recognize that this is a classic combination problem.  Using this technique, he can see easily that in a 28 day month, there are 3 weekdays and 7 weekend days, the former having 1 person using 1 plate, hence, 2 per week which is 12 per month minus the Saturday night scrounging effort.\n\nBased on the fact that 7 people are using 2 plates, that 7 times multiplied equals 14, or more precisely, 14 dishes need to be obtained for the weekly dinner routine, this is added to the 40 required for the weekend gatherings, resulting in only 23 plates being required to meet Matt's basic need.\n\nThis being the case, it is clear to see, that if he was not looking at this as a simple way to accommodate everyone, he would have bought a dozen more plates than he actually needed.\n\nThe reason behind all this, is the inefficiency of buying for an actual need, rather than a perceived need.  Had he bought exactly what he needed, he would have saved himself $25 for the month, and in 4 months saved $100 with only an investment of 5 minutes, which is time that he would have spent on the phone or internet looking for information on how to calculate the number of plates required when you know the number of people.\n\nWhen one takes the time to think a problem through, even to the point of buying more than you need, it is sometimes difficult to see why you would.", "answer": " 38"}

Then from 240, you subtract 2, so 238 is left. 236/30=8 then, 236/25=9.96 then you have 8 students with 30 desks and 9 students with 25 desks. That adds up to 17 students that have a desk to themselves. Then the remaining students that have a desks to share is 21.

Their pace is 9 miles per hour, but the road takes a crooked path, so they take 33\u20444 hours.  How far does they walk?\"\n\n### Dem: The speed is 9 miles per hr, (miles per hour)  Then crooked path= 33/4 hr=.5(5) hr.  This is 3 hr for each side or 6 total.  Then 9*6=54.  They travel for 54 miles in 6 hr.  The distance is 54/100 or 0.6 of a mile or 0.6 mile walked\n\n### Inst: A frog that starts 5 miles away from a pond jumps in the same distance in the same amount of time regardless of whether he starts from the right edge of the pond or left.

From the question, he jumps the same distance in the  same amount of time.  So he must have an equal rate.   The answer has to be an integer that will divide evenly into the distance and time.   So let the frog jump the same length in an equal amount of time.  He can jump 5(time) from the edge of the Pond.  This should have the same amount of time he can jump 5.  So the distance is 5(time), which is the same as 25(distance)  But the question did not say how large of a", "answer": " 32"}

Now that we can do that, we can calculate the total number of liters of milk produced by each cow. \nFinally, we can use the same formula to calculate how many liters of milk all the cows produce. However instead of entering the number of liters per cow multiply this by the number of cows (5).\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe answer to this problem is 5 cows. It may seem like a really simple question but it could confuse lots of students that might have not learned how to solve this question. This could be a difficult question to answer if you were trying to solve the problem without a calculator.\n\n### Input A: Every week, five cows on a farm produce 2900 quarts of milk on average.

{"text": "The problem above can be described as follows: An object's height is 12 feet. The object's height is measured at H(t), at various \"times,\" (t) until a time T at which the object breaks and its height measurement (at T) is found to be 6 feet. At times of 0, 1, 2,... 12, the object has a height of 1, 2,..., 12 respectively. The broken state of the object at T occurs after H(12).\n\nA height measurement can be expressed with the number H(t) which relates to the height as measured by a tape measure at time t, where t is an index number.\n\nA solution to this problem, in terms of the time t is H(t) = H + 2H(1) - H(12). This solution is written in terms of a function with the domain and range of two variables. 2H(1), is the first and last time the height is measured. The solution above is for a function of the form H(t), where t is the time measured using index number from 0 to 12.\n\nA line can be drawn with a slope of 2 or 0 and the following equation of a line with a y intercept of 2 feet:  H(t) = 2t + 2. If that is the equation of the line, then the 2 should be omitted and the 2 should be added to the y intercept to produce a y intercept of 4 feet.\n\nT can be used to represent the time value when the height is broken. Therefore, T = 12 and the broken state of the object happens at T\n\nThe broken state of a flagpole that was 12 feet tall happens at time 12 when the flagpole was measured with a tape measure at a time 0, 1,,,12. The height of the flagpole breaks at time 12 such that the new measurement result is H(12), which is the height measurement of the tip of the flag.\n\n### Output:\n\nThe height of the flag at the time when the flag is broken is 6 feet.\n\n### Sources:", "answer": " 7"}

So, to get to the end of the 8-minute allotted time, he'll need 4 more minutes and to eat 40 additional wings.\n\nWe can write this as, for n even numbers (we're not going to say what is even), if b is bigger than a by bn, then there's an a' such that a'b' = a, and a'b' is bigger than b.

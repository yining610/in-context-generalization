Let\u2019s analyze each possible choice in detail.\nFor the first case, if x is 99, that means she started with 99. Then, for the first hour, she would have collected 15(0.1) + 99 = 11.99, and for the second hour, x + 15 > 99, so she would have collected 35 + 15 > than 11.9, x + 35 > 99. Therefore, during the two hours she collected 50 more than the initial 99 coins, which is 149.94, so her total should have been 149.10 + 99 =148.\n\nNext, what if x is 98? If the answer in the previous case was that she would have collected 99 coins during the two hours after her initial collection, it means that after taking away 99 coins as the payment to her coworker, she would have taken 98 during the two hours. Like in the previous case, it should have been at least that amount, and yet we have x + 35, and x + 15, both exceeding the initial collection.\n\nIn the third case, we are given that x was initially 85, and 85 + 99 < 101, so she would have gotten her 99 coins back. Then again, after all her coworker took away 15, she would again have x coins left from the initial 85. The second choice in each time interval is that she was collecting 35 every hour, so how does that work from x = 85?

Bread cost $2 + the cost of bread is $2 * $2 = $4, which is half of the price of the butter, and butter was $3, and the bread he bought cost $2 + 2 times $2 = $4 because the cost of the bread was $2, the butter cost $3, to get $4 add $2 and $2 = $4, and the butter he bought was $3.The juice cost $4 + 2 times $4 = $8 because the cost of bread was $2, the cost of butter was $3 which got $5, add $2 and $5 = $7,and the price of juice was $4.So in total Paul spent $20, had $15, and he had $5 left because 5 * 5 = 25.And this shows what Paul really got left.\n\n## Additional Resources\n* [Khan Academy's GMAT Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-ninth-grade-math/operations-with-fractions/fractions-decimals-percents/v/fractions-and-decimals-on-the-gmat)\n* [Manhattan Prep's GMAT Strategy Video](https://www.manhattangmat.com/strategy-videos/how-to-solve-harder-questions-on-the-practice-problems-section-of-the-gmat-reasoning-question-sets-part-1)\n* [Test Preparation Online's GMAT FAQs](https://testprepat.com/faq-gmat/)\n* [EduRev Math's GMAT Preparation](https://www.edurev.in/gmat-preparation-guide)\n* [GMAT Exam's Maths Section](https://www.mbbsinsider.com/pte-gmat-etp.aspx)", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "John volunteers for thirty hours yearly.\n\n### Rationale:You may break down the calculation into the following steps.\n\n### 1. Count the number of working days in a year.\n\n### Number of Working Days in a year=365\n\n### 2. Divide 30 (hours in a year) by 3 (time/session) i.e. 30(hours)/3(hours).\n\n### 3. Multiply the decimal fraction 10(hours) from 30(hundredths of hours).\n\n### This brings about the following result;\n\nAnswers: 365/3(30 hours in a year/3 days/hour in a session) \u2248 122 hours/3(hours per session) \u2248 40 hours/session\n\n### How many hours is 122.69 days?\n\nTo find out how many hours are 122.7 days, you need to find 122.4 days and subtract 2.7 days. Then, you multiply the result by 24 to find 1200, because in one day there are 24 hours. Finally, you will divide 1200 by 24 and get 50.\n\nYou can calculate how many hours are 50 days. Divide 50 days by 24 to get how many hours are 20% of a day.\n\n122.7 is equal to 52.496 hrs.\n\n1200(total hours in 60 days)/24(number of hours in a day)\n\n120 * 24 = 2880 hrs and 2.7 / 24 = 0.1125 hrs\n\nThus, 40.5404758987953% of a day = 0.12016666667.\n\n### Input Question: I have a $120.00 note.

Choices:  A. $150 B. $50 C. $85 D. $70 E. $500\nRationales: We start by analyzing the question to identify the location of the fish tank. We can see that the shark is inside the fish tank, and thus, the fish tank is within a location. \nNext, we examine the description of the fish tank, which states that the fish tank was large and extremely expensive. This tells us that the fish tank was expensive not in terms of the cost of its contents but rather in terms of its cost in terms of money. \nAs the fish tank is in a location, we can eliminate options A and E. \nWe can further eliminate options D and B by ruling out any location which is too small for the fish tank to be situated, such as an aquarium or small corner of the room. \nThis leaves us with option C, which states that the shark was inside the fish tank, implying the fish tank is large and expensive.\n\nAnswer: C. $85\n\n### Input : The fish tank was large and was expensive because of a shark.

The bags don't say how many people are in each bag, so the reader could guess 4 people in every bag (16 total) and 1 + 1 + 1+ 1 + 1 = 4 bags. This is too quick and doesn't take advantage of the clues given in the problem. If you think this through carefully, 15 divided by 3 (the total number of bags that Gerald has 40 apples in) tells you that Pam has 5 bags. \n\n1200 + 0 + 360 + 36 = 1656 + 0 + 88 + 64 = 2600 which, when done in columns, gives you 2600 = 1 + 15 + 15 +15 = 40 This is why Pam has 40 appels, in 5 bags, so Pam has 40 in each bag, and has 200 apples total, meaning that this problem is solved.\n\n### How To:\n\n-First read the scenario\n-Identify all of the problems and questions\n-Separate the question from its rationale\n-Underline the key words\n-Understand the rationale by interpreting the clues and the context\n-Find the information that is relevant to the question\n-List all of the possible options of answers and analyze them using critical thinking\n-Determine which answer is given to you in the prompt\n-The key is to read each sentence carefully and to understand it to the best of your ability.", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "He spends $26.\n### Rationalize: 1. First, we must consider the question given. \n2. The question asks \"when he is done making his loaves of bread, how much flour he has left if he bought the cheapest flour\". \n3. Given that a 10-poud bag of flour costs 10 dollars and a 12 pounds bag costs 13 dollars, we know that \"cheapest\" means \"10 dollars or less\".\n4. Next, we must consider the choices. We have two choices for flour: one costing 10 dollars, the other costing 13. Since we need 4 pounds of flout per loaf, we need at least 40 pounds in total (\"10\" for 10 loaves, and then additional \"4\" for 1 extra loaf needed).  \n5. So, in the worst case where Tommy only buys the cheaper flour that costs 10 dollars, he would need to buy at least 40 loaves of flour. However, only one 10 pounds bag holds 40 pounds of flout, and it would cost 10\u00d740, or 400 dollars.\n6. In the best case where Tommy only buyes the cheaper flour tat costs 13 dollars total, he would need to buying at least 30 loaves of flout, since one 12 pounds bag contains 36 pounds.\n7. If he buys this type of flour, he would need to pay 13\u00d730 or 390 dollars. \n8. However, Tommy already made 12 loaves. So, he has one loaf left. \n9. Therefore, if he bought the cheaper 12-poud flout, he would have spent a total of 26 dollars, or 26\u00d712, or 312 dollars. \n10. Therefore, we can see that buying the cheapest flout yields the least spending total, at least among the choices.\n### Instruction - How to find the sum of three consecutive numbers.\n### Choices:  A) 101 B) 103 C) 105 D) 109\n##", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "Answer: $24\n\n### Logic: To arrive at a price, add 80% of the wholesale price. The retail (total) price for a pair of pants would be $36. The wholesale price therefore, will be 1/5 (5% of $36) less than retail price. The wholesale must be lower to justify the retail to give a profit.

Lana can eat 12 of them a day and if they take away 1090 out of 1300 for each of them. Find out how many of them are left then add half the remaining to each and the other half to the bucket what will he balance on the scale.\n\n### Rationales\nI think that we can rule out Jacob because he will not be eating what he can eat. Instead, he will eat more than what he can, and the equation can be stated as (100-A)+(12-B) = (A/2)+(B/2). A is the number before Nellie eats.\nThis is a linear equation, and it should be obvious what the variables represent (at least it is to me).\nThe first equation given is (100-12)+(12-100) = (12/2)+(-100/2)\nThe second equation given is (12-109)+(109-12) = (109/2)+(-12/2)\nNow, take B = 100 and A = 12 and the answers for the previous two equations when summed will be (20)-(1090) = -1070 and (80)-(1164) = -1244\nNow, take B \ud835\udcf6 \ud835\udcfc \ud835\udcfa\ud835\udcfc  = 20 and A = 20 and the answers for the equation given equals -6 and 18 which when added gives 12.\n\nThus, Nellie will be getting the sourball candies that Jacob has.\nAnswer: We can state A=99 and B=6.

At that time, a group of 3508 elephants departed the park by exodus at a rate of 2,667 elephants per hour.

First, we make sure our understanding of the text is correct by examining the given choices.\n\n2. The sentence describing the duration of Kenny's basketball practice is written \"he ran for twice as long\". When we think about what \"long\" means, the term \"hours\" makes sense. But since the sentence says \"longer\", the term \"minutes\" makes sense. In that case, 10 hours would be correct.\n\n3. Similarly, the sentence describing Kenny's trumpet practice is written \"he practiced on the trumput longer\". When we think about the term \"long\", the term \"minues\" would make sense. So, 12 minutes would be the correct choice.\n\n4. With all that understood, we can calculate the duration of Kenny basketball practice using the formula \"played basketball + ran = 10 minutes\". This results in 22 minutes.\n\n5. We can calculate the duration of trumpet practice by using the formula \"practice on the trumpet + ran = 12 minutes\". This results in a total of 24 minutes.\n\n6. Finally, when we subtract the duration of trumpat e practice (24 minutes) from the duration of basketball practice (22 minutes), we can find out how many minutes were spent practicing the trumpet (48 minutes - 24 = 24).\n\n7. Applying these concepts, we can answer the question \"how many hours did Kenny pracice on the trumpety last week?\" the answer is 24 hours.\n\nAnswer: 24 hours\n\n# Examples:\n\n### Exampel 1: Which of the following is the best description of the term \"fiercely\"?\n\n### Response : A: Angry\n\n###", "answer": " 40"}

Choices:  A. packed B. racking C. thronging D. crowding E. bouncing\nRationales:The store was very busy, which can be described by using any of the words provided.\n\n#### Choices:\n1. The word 'packed' suggests that the store contains a packed or dense arrangement of items. This description is contrary to the statement given in the question, which states that the store was crowded with shops and kids. Therefore, it is less suitable to describe the store as 'packed'.\n2. Similarly, the word \"racking\" suggests an organized or systematic arrangement of items, which is not consistent with the information provided.\n3. Similarly, the word 'thronging' refers to an intense and crowded gathering of individuals and does not suggest that the store was crowds with kids as the question states.\n4. Therefore, the only options that could describe the state of the store are options C (Crowding), D (Crowded), and E (Bouncing).\n5.

{"text": "The key to finding the right answer is to understand the question and properly interpret the choices.\n\nThe question requires us to determine how many days it will take for one amoeba (singular) to divide into 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 amo\nebae (the choices given).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the question by the amoeba and the rate of reproduction it has, dividing by 2 to equal 24 days.\n\nWe can then deduce that the amoebae will divide into two amoebae after 2 days, four amoebae after a further two days, eight amoebae after an additional two days, and sixteen amoebae in the final two days.\n\nSo, the cumulative number of days it will take for an amoeba to produce 16 amoen\n\nbae is 24 days. This means the amoeba will need two weeks to produce the 16 amoenae.\n\nTherefore, when the amoebae reproduces in the two days it takes to divide again, this process will happen eight times before it reaches 16 amoentabe.\n\nAnswer: Eight days.\n\n### Input & Response:\n<pre>Where does a dog live?</pre>\n\n<code> Choices:</code>\n\n<pre><code>A: apartment, B: house C: den D: hut E: mansion</code></pre>\n\nOne might assume this question to refer to the physical location of a dog, or where it physically resides. However, this is not always the case. It is often used to describe where or with who a dog lives, or is treated as a place of residence. \n\nThe word \"live\" can be used to refer to a place of residence, as in \"where do you live?\", which would imply that the dog is not the building but rather occupies a space at a particular location.\n\nFurthermore, the word \"live\" can also refer to the concept of a home or habitat, which may be less physical and more symbolic, such as a person's pet. \n\nFor example, a parent might say to their child: \"You must", "answer": " 8"}

Since dust is a nuisance or problem, one might think of cleaning it off.\n3. Grape is a non-fruit choice, but could be considered as it is often covered in dust and is associated with wine, which is often consumed dry or served with dusty air.\n4. We can eliminate E: grape because it's not a fruit.\n5.

Choices:  A the shrimp was dry B the shrimp was damp C the shrimp was fresh D the shrimp was fried E the shrimp was boiled\nRationales:\n1. The word 'but' indicates a contrast, and the clue that the shrimp was big suggests that the shrimp may not be one of the other options. For example, it is likely not damp, dried, or fried, and it is unlikely to be boiled or fresh.\n2. Consider the other word in the sentence, suggesting a contrast: 'big'. Big can be contrasted with small or dry, damp, fresh, fried, or boiled.\n3. These can each be eliminated by their meanings:\ni. Dry: Can refer to food that has been dehydrated for long periods of time, which is not likely here as that would cause the shrimp to appear shriveled and malnourished.\nii. Damp: Dishwater dampness indicates saturated moisture caused by washing, which is not how shrimp is typically cooked.\niii. Fresh: Refers to uncooked vegetables and other foods preserved to be used fresh rather than dried, which is not what was implied given the context.\niv. Boiled: Refers to cooking vegetables in water until they are firm but tender, which is also not compatible with the given context and description concerning the shrimp being 'big'.\nv. Fried: Refers to cooked food with oil and other ingredients fried at high temperature. This is also not compatible with shrimp being big due to the water content, which would make it shrink and make it harder to describe as big.\n4.

{"text": "A: 170 more trees\n\n### Rationales: Step 1: Break down the problem into steps.\n1. Firstly, determine the number of trees the company cut down and wants to plant during the year.\n2. Secondly, we know the company cut down (200 x 2) + (300 x 2 = 900) trees on each half of the year.\n3. Now, identify the question and the goal to accomplish.\n4. The goal is to plant trees, and the challenge is to determine how many more trees they need to plant.\n5. The question is to determine how many MORE trees do they need to plant. That's why we need to subtract from 900 which is the total number of trees cut down and planted.\n6. If we subtract 900 from the end result, we would get 900 - 900 = 0.\n7. So what we need now is to subtract 0 from both sides, which will get us to the final result of 900 -0=900.\nStep 2: Apply rationales and mathematics.\n8. Now we can make use of the formula. That is, for every 900 trees, they need to plant 700 more.\n9. It is because the company had chopped down x200 more trees than it had planted x300= 900 more during the year.\n10. So, 3x200 +3x300 = 900\n11. Therefore, we know that for every 90 of trees the company had chopped, needed to plant 70 more.\n12. So to find out how many trees does the company need more, we can rewrite the formula by replacing both sides with a 900 as follows:\n13. 490+900 = 1390\n14. 490=140x3, as 900+490 = 1300\n15.

{"text": "I can't answer your questions, but I'm not being coached while I'm writing this.\n\n### Rationale:\nGiven that the amount Luna spent for groceries each month is equal to 6/10 (or 60%) of what she spent on rent each month, and her spending on phone bill is equal to 1/10 (or10%) of what she spends on food, we can determine Luna's total amount spent on groceries by finding her total monthly income, which is $240.\n\nTo get groceries to equal 60% of income, we need to divide groceries by.6 (or 6/10), which equals $40.\n\nBut since Luna spends $40 on groceries each month and her spending on groceries equals 60% of what she spends to rent, we can conclude that Luna spends $60 to rent her house each month.\n\nThis is the answer to part 1 of the question (how much Luna spends on rent).\n\nNext, the question asks how much Luna spends every month on her groceries. Her spending on grocer is 60% of rent and her grocery spending is $60, so her grocery budget is $60 *.6, which equals $36. Given that part 2 of the answer, we know that Luna makes $240 annually in rent, and we know how much she spends on rent and groceries each month.\n\nThus, part 3 of the answer is $240 * 12 ($240 annually to rent and groceries), divided by $36 ($36 in groceries and $60 in rent), or $240/60+36 which equals $8, 8.\n\nSo, answer 3 is $8, 8, and part 4 is $8, 000. Luna's total expenditure for the year is $8, 440.\n\nAnswer: $8, 436", "answer": " 249"}

{"text": "Leonel has five more cats than anthony and 11 more dogs.\n### Rationale : 1. The problem states that Anthony has 12 dogs, which is clearly the case, given that 12 is the only number in the question that is not followed by either a division operator (\u00f7) or a multiplication operator (*). 2. Similarly, Leonel also has 12 dogs. 3. The problem states that Leonel and Anthony each have a different number of cats. 4. In other words, the question is informing us that the two of them have different numbers of cats. 5. Because 1 is a factor of both 2 and 3, there's no solution to this problem besides having one cat fewer on one end than at the other. 6. Using either the division operator (\u00f7) and the addition operator (+), this can be accomplished. 7. The number of animals owned by each person can be shown, as the numbers imply they share only one cat (1). 8. Leonel has 1/3 more cats than Anthony and 11 more cats than Anthony, which equates to [((12-2)/3) +11] cats in total. 9. So the answer to the problem, which is the total number of pets owned by the two, is 13.\nAnswer: B. 13\n\n### Input :There is a famous actor in the United States who has won an award five years ago!\n### Response :How many years ago has this award been given? \nOption: 2\nOption : 3\nOption : 4\nOption : 5\nOption : 6\nOption : 7\nRationales:There is a famous actor awarded 5 years ago, which means after winning five years ago, he has not been awarded for the last 5 years.

If she paid a total of $7.43 for the bagel and the sandwich, how much did she pay for each?\n\n### Demystification;\nThe first thing we need to do is figure out the discount rate.\n\nSuppose you bought a sandwich that costs $8.39 and it came with a 33% off discount. What does this mean?\n\nA 33% discouragement means that you discount $2.75 from anything $8.39.\n\nThis is how you apply the discount rate to this example. When you do this, you'll know how much each bagal and sandwich cost.\n\nFirst, subtract $2.75 with 0.33. If we write this mathematically, this is $2.75/100 times.33/100. Then, you'll end up with $0.96.\n\nNow we have the discount rate of 0.96 and we can apply it. The bagel costs $4.73. This isn't what you pay 4.73 but what you", "answer": " 220"}

{"text": "The cost for one lunch for all students is $68.80\n\n### Demostration:\nThe process for finding the answer is as follows: We will assign values for quantities in the given problem and perform basic algebraic operations to find the total cost.\n1. We know that there are 259 students in 5 third grade classes, 364 students in 4 fourth grade classes, and 365 students in 4 fifth grade classes.\n2. The problem states that each student gets a hambuger which costs $2.20, some carrotes which cost $0.10, and a cookie which costs $0.20 each.\n3. A hamburger costs $2.2 and there are 10 hamburgers for 10 students in one unit.\n4. Thus, the amount paid for hamburgers for students in 5th grade is $(4*2.2*364) + (4*2.2*(365 - 364)) = $468.16\n5. However, to find the total cost paid for lunch, we must subtract the amount paid for lunch given to third grade students.\n6. We know that each student from third, fourth and fifth grade gets a hamburger and a piece of carrot. We also know that they get one carrot each with a hamburger, so from the second equation the total cost of lunch for students from third, fourth and firth grade is ${4*2.2}$ + ${10*2.1}$ + ${10 *.50 * 10}$ = $683.40.\n7. Hence we subtract $683.30 from the total cost of school lunch to find out the total cost of lunc for all students.\n8. The answer is: ${(683.4) - (683.3)} = 0.10 = $0.\n9. Therefore, the total cost is $68.50.\n\n### Input and Response\n### Instruction\nBetty plans a lunch party for 26 people.

If each avocado contaibs 5 servings, Georgie would have at least 45 servings.  7*5*5=7(servings for each avocado)*9(number of avocados)=45.  Therefore, Georgie has at least 45.

The glove compartment contained all the cash that the retired policeman had in it. The crooks who drove away from the car did so with all the car\u2019s contents.

Given the context of exercise and the specific question, the most fitting answer is a health club, rather than the \"gym\" seen in choice A.

Mary: 5 buckets less \n3.Iris: 1 bucket less \n\nSo, the sandbox is Iris's.\n\nTheir sum is:\n\n1 + 2 - 3 + 3\n\nThen just divide each side by the total sand in a bucket, two pounds, and we find Iris collected 15 pounds; Eden collected 20 pounds; and Mary collected 12 pounds.\n\n### Input & Constraints:  Three women are preparing to decorate their wedding dresses.\nAshley chooses flowers: peonies, roses, and tulips.

According to the question, they saw 100 at the front, and 2 times more at the back. Hence, there are 400 cars at the back. As this doesn't make sense, they must be missing some cars in the equation, so multiply the 400 at the back by an extra zero. The answer is the number of cars at the back multiplied by 5.\n\nChoices A: 200: If the answer was 200, this means that 200 extra cars were on the back lot when the play ended, hence they packed in another 500 cars while the play was on.  \nChoices B: 800: This contradicts with the rule of thumb \"2 times more\" (meaning 400), since we know that 100 = 2 times more than 50. Hence, the answer must be a number that contains 400 at least (in the answer, not in the equation). For example, 200 more than 400 = 600. This contradicts that the total number of vehicles at the end of the day was 700.\nChoices C: 50: 100 = twice the number of cars in the front paring lot; which cannot be correct since it implies that 100 is the total number of cars they saw, making 200 total including 100 in front. 600 is also not possible since if it was 600, they would have seen more cars in total at the end of the night than they saw at the beginning, not the least (700 \u2013 100 =600). \nChoices D: 1000: This is impossible. According to the question at beginning, \"2 times more\" refers to the back parking lot, meaning they saw 200 more cars in the parking lot in the back than the front lot, because 100 =2 times more than 40.

{"text": "He pays $347.\n\n### Justification:\n1. Firstly, we will eliminate incorrect options by comparing the costs of the cartridges to the price of the final product.\n2. The costs of the black-and-white and color cartridges are listed separately. By analyzing their prices and the way they are presented, we can conclude that the question is asking to determine the total cost of the printer cartridges.\n3. We will eliminate Option A, which states that if Jerry adds ten black-and-white pages to a black-and-green laser printer, he can print for sixteen hours. This doesn't seem to be a problem that involves buying printer cartridges, and it's also an unrelated information that cannot be inferred from the given information.\n4. Similarly Option B, which says that if the cartridge costs 347 cents, and each black-and -green laser printer cartridge contains 8 black-and-white sides, then 464 laser printers would be created by adding eight sides, is also incorrect, as the question is about the cost of adding printer cartridges, not the amount of printers created.\n5. The choice C states that there will be four cartons of laser printer cartridges, priced at $ 38.40 per carton. The option D is about the price of the printer, $ 807.50 + 4 black-and-white laser printer cartridged. In each option, the term \"cartridges\" is used for a plurality, or a quantity of cartridges, which seems like an over estimate, as the question asks about the total cost of adding 16 cartridges, which is 16, or a lot more than 4. The number 4 is also unlikely to be correct, since 4 would require 4 black and white cartridges to create a black and white printer.\n6. Therefore Option E (which states that if the printer cartridge costs 27 dollars, and there are 6 color cartridges, then you will need to replace the 6 color cartridiges at a cost of $ 159.60, and the rest of the 6 cartridges at a cost of $236.00), is the only remaining option that", "answer": " 123"}

The centre was originally built with 20 employees but as more people were needed, it was expanded. Last month, the centre saved an average of 156 employees but they needed 195 employees to run at full capacity. How many employees were needed during month 1?\n\n### Demostration\nTo start, the number of employees required to save X% is equal to (X * # Employees * Average Cost To Employ An Employee), divided by 100%. \n\nTherefore: ((20 * 100 * Average Cost To Save 10% Employees))/(100%), rounded down will give us the amount of Employees needed to save 10% on month 1.\n\nWe know we want to save 10%, we need to know the percentage of employees that we need to employ. \n\nTo find the percentage we multiply the amount of employees originally employed by 11%. \n\nThis way we can calculate the amount of employees we would hire each month, and the percentage to hire each month. \n\nWe know that (20 * (11%))/(100) = 2.2, therefore, the percentage of employees we would hired is 2.2.\n\nWe can go ahead and find out how many employees we would hire.\n\n(195 - 22 * 10) / (100 - 10%) == 1\n\nSo, we have to hire a number 1 employee, each month. \nFinally, we know that (20 + 1 = 21), therefore we need to hire 21 employees in our second month.", "answer": " 113"}

So, the options that are not suitable are a mattress, a throw, and pillow covers.\n2. A square foot is the standard unit for measuring an area. We are only talking about the area, so square feet is the most important option.\n3. Option C says 7'x 8'. So, 7 feet by 8 feet will give an area of 50 square feet. This tells us what we require.\n4.

{"text": "Javier can sell 80 dozen donuts in order to meet his fundraising goal.\n\n### Reason: Javier sells each donut at $1 each, and buys them for $2.4 each. From this, Javier can see that in order to meet his goal of reaching $96, he needs the sale of 80 dozen donut since each dozen sold earns $8. This means that Javier can only make $8 per dozen by selling donuts, which makes $8 times 80, thus, $640. The original $640 is multiplied by 4 because each dozen worth 4 donuts are sold. Javier then is able to see that his fundraising goal of getting $96 requires him to sell another dozen worth of donuts, which is equivalent to 4 donuts. Since Javier only gets $4 from the 4 donuts he originally got from $640 and needs to get $96, he would need to buy another dozen donuts which would allow him to sell 80 donuts for $96.

Let see, Juice left: 1000-10=990. Now, we see that 990 gallons of Juice is left and for each gallon, there are 10 cups in one container. Then, in the 990 cups, if 10 are already taken, it means that there are 80 cups left.

If the pizza is too thin, the grocery store would be giving away money.\n5: 4: \"Medium\" is incorrect, as 1: 5 2: 5, 3: 5 4: 6.

{"text": "Leah ended up with a mere $1 (dollar).\n\n### Demosntration:\n1. The first thing to do is to rewrite the sentence to replace confusing language with simpler, more straightforward language. We want to answer how much money did Leah earn after all. It's very simple and makes more sense to say: \"How many dollars did Leah earn\". \n2. Now we must calculate the lost value of the money that Leah lost. Using Leah's savings account, one can easily calculate how much money was shredded which is 28.25$ as the word, \"a seventh of it\" represents 7$ or a seventh of the money. \n3. Leah also said that she put half of the rest. Thus, she put half of 27=13.50$ in her savings account and she spent 28.24$ on the milkshake. Leah's saving increased by 9.40$; however, her loss of 17.84$ leaves Leah with 10.61$. She's left with 10.96$ including the money she spent on the milkshake, so she can keep a milkshake and still have 0.24$ in her wallet.\n\n### Input\nThe teacher explained how to properly hold a pencil, he said that you must do what? \n\nChoices: A: Hold lightly B: Hold gently C: Hold carefully D: Hold properly\n\nRationales: A,B,D are words meaning 'lightly'.

First, $27 + $7 = $34 2. Second, $15 + $15 = $30 3. Third, $20 + $20 = $40 4. Fourth, $16 + $16 = $32 The difference between $34 and $27 is $7.

{"text": "She can juggle 17 objects.\n\n### Explanation: We are provided with the information that Jeanette can juggle more objects each week, and each week Jeanette practices for five weeks. Let the total number of objects she can juggle at week 0 be x. Therefore, in week 0 she can juggle x number of objects.\n\n#### Example 1: Week 1\n\nFor each number of the week, we can multiply x (which is the number of objects that she can juggle at the beginning of the week) by an unknown number called y to find the number of objects each week. For example, if we multiply x by 2, we get 2x number of objects, which is 2x.\n\n#### Example: 2x\n\nFor the first week, we know that x x, since x multiplied in week 0 by y (which is the number we are trying to find), since x is multiplied by itself. Therefore, 2x = 2x.\nAt week 2, she can juggle 4x and at week 3 she can juggle 6x. For each week starting from week 2, she multiplies x by 1.5, since 1+1/2 = 1.5. For every other week she multiplies by 1/2. At week 3 she can now juggle 6x, at week four she can juggle x, and so on.\n\nTherefore x = 3.16.\n\nAt week 5 she can juggle 10.28 objects. By adding the number of objects she can't juggle the first week (3 objects) to the week 5 juggling count (13 objects) we can reach 17 objects.

{"text": "The number of lions was equal to 148.\n\n### How did you solve this problem?\n\nWhen confronted with this question, some students might feel anxious and unsure how to approach it. However, with some time to understand the question, it is fairly easy to solve.\n\nThe first step is to read the question carefully and understand exactly what it was asking. Students should break down each part of the wording and identify the key terms: the word \"cub\" indicates that the lions are young and the number 5 is the number of newborns that are born each month, and the word \"die\" implies that one lion is killed each month.\n\nThen, the students can solve the problem on the basis of logical reasoning. They can count up the number of months it took to reach a population of 148 lion cubs and use multiplication to determine the final number.\nStart with an original lion population of \"1\" (noted at \"first\"), which can be multiplied as follows: \"1\" x 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 x 10 x 11 x 12 = 148 liones.\nThis multiplication shows that at the end of the first year, \"148\" lions were present.\nTo get the original number one starts with \"1\" and multiplies this by \"1\" for each month. Then one multiplies this number by the number of cubs born that month (5 in each month). Therefore, one can multiply 148 (the end population) by 52 (the 5 cubs born per lion and the 12 months that passed) and get 7835 as the final result. \"7\", \"8\" and \"3\" are the cube numbers of \"1\" multiplied by the multiplication result.\nAnswer: Answer: 148", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "It took him six minutes.\nRationales: We can solve this problem by considering the following: 1. The airport parking lot has 1,209 spaces. 2. We can break the parking lot down into Sections G and Section H, and each section has 50 cars, making a total of 100. 3. We could solve this problem by creating a systematic process to determine the number of cars Nate needed to walk past. 4. We can determine the number of cars by multiplying the number of cars in the sections by the number of minutes it takes Nate to walk past a car. 5. From our first two assumptions, we can determine that Nate walks past 1,200 cars in six minutes, which means that Nate walked past 200 cars per minute. 6.

Choices: 1. $22.88 2. $18.98 3. $24.96 4. $24.32 5. $18.24\nRationales: Firstly, the question states that the price was $17.9. It is known that this would be $1 less than 18 because $0.1 is just 1/100th of $1.\nNext, the question states that it is 30% more than $17.9 but does not specify whether the $30 is per $1 ($30/1 = 30% increase) or per 30 cents ($30/0.3 = $100 increase).

Unfortunately, 5% typically don\u2019t attend her wedding.\n\n### Rationales:\nIt is assumed that no one is excluded from receiving an invitation and that the 220 people invited includes both the 220 attending and the 5% who are expected to not show.\n\n### Thus, if 220 is the total amount of people invited and 1.05 is the approximate number of guests expected not to attend, then you can find how many people will go to the wedding by dividing 220 (the total amount of people invited) by 1.05 (the approximate expected number of guests not to attend).\n\n### To use this logic, you first subtract the number of people expected not to attend from the total amount of people who were invited. For this example, you take 220 (total amount invited) minus 11 (number of people expected to not attend) = 209.\n\n### Next, you divide. In this case, the number of guests attending is 209. By dividing the total amount invited divided by the number of guests not attending, you can find the percentage of guests who will attend.", "answer": " 209"}

Therefore, the total distance he has traveled is 45 miles and he has 2 gallons of petrol left. \n\nThe question is about rate per miles, which means we have to take 45 miles and divide it by the number of gallons (2).

Trades A and B start to go at the same pace once they begin their journey, so which part of Montana will truck B have to go through before they meet if truck A had traveled at a speed of 60mph?\n\n### Demostration and Response: From Butte to Whitefish it takes about 84 miles, whereas, from Whitefish to Butte it takes 125 miles. So, in order to get to Butte, truck B has to cover a distance of 210 miles. Truck A would have gone 84 miles in this time, which means truck B would take 126 miles to cover the extra distance (which is the difference between the routes). However, they leave at the same time at 60mph, which means they travel at a rate of 46mph.

{"text": "10\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1: Understanding the question. \n- The problem asks for the number of cans of paint Lucille needs. The question also mentions that each can of paint covers two square meters, which will be useful in solving the problem.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing given choices. \n- The choices presented are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10. We need the can of paint solution to work with a number that is divisible by all possible lengths in Lucille's room. If Lucille has a wall that is 3 meters wide, we need 3 cans of paint to cover it, and the same is with 4, 5 and 6. However, 2 cans do not divide the final wall which is 4 meter wide and 2 meters high, which is a mismatch. So, 10 seems to be the only viable number among the choices.\n\nStep 3: Solving the problem.\n- Here, we will solve for the number of can of paint Lucille needs given that each can of paint can covers 2 square meters. Firstly, we divide the width of the walls by 2 to get the meter squares of the wall; 3 meters divided by 2 is 1.5, and 4 divided by 2 is also 2. Similar division is done with the last wall of 4 meters. This step provides a number of 1.5, 2 and 2 in Lucille's 5 meter long wall. We then multiply 1.5,2 and 2 with the length of the painted surface by each amount, which provides 3, 4 and 8 square meters. The same calculations provide 10, 10, 8, respectively with 30 square meters on all these walls. Now, multiplying 10 by all the three numbers gives us 150 to cover the whole surface area with one can of paint.\n\nConclusion: To solve this problem, analyze the situation and the given information and do the necessary calculations.\n\n### Input:\"Pig\" can be written as the product of what three two-digit numbers in ascending order?

{"text": "In order to calculate Uki\u2019s total earnings for five continuous days, we have to factor in the information given in the question. This includes the prices of cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits, along with the amount that Uki can bake of each item per day.\n\n### The first step is to determine the total price per day for all the products sold. This can be calculated by summing the prices of the items along with multiplying this sum with the amount baked per day. Thus, the total price per day can be calculated as follows: \n\n$1.50 for 20 cupcakes $2 for 10 cookies $1 for 20 biscuits\n\nFor $1.50 for a cupcake x 20 cupcakess = $30 and for $2 for a cookie x 10 cookies = $20\n\nand for $1 for a biscuit x 20 biscuittss = $20\nTotal price: $70\n\n### The next step is to sum up the earnings for each day. We can do this by multiplying the price per day per item by the total amount that Uki can produce per day. For example, for day one, we multiply the price per day for cupcakes with 20 which is $30. This is because Uki has baked 20 cupcaks that day which is equal to a total of $30 for that day. Similarly, multiply the price per day of biscuits with 20 to get $20 and similarly multiply the price per day off cookies with 10 to get $2 for that day.\n\n\nHence, if we simply sum up and add these earnings, they will equal to $150. This shows that if we can bake 5 days in a row, then the total earnings for 5 days will be $150 which is Uki\u2019s total baking earnings for 5 continuous days.\n\n### Hence, the total baking earnings of Uki over 5 continuous days can be simply calculated by summing up the following earnings:\n$30 (1 st Day earnings for cupcakes) + $20 ( 2nd Day earning for biscuits) + $20( 3rd Day earnings for", "answer": " 350"}

This is because the total length of the first movie was 1 hour 30 minutes, and the second movie was 30 minutes long, which means it could be 1.5 hour.\nThe second step is to eliminate variables like'm' and 'b'.\nThere are two movies. 'b' refers to the first movie, while'm' refers to the second movie. We can assume that b is greater than 1, while m is greater than b (this is because'm' must be bigger than 'b' in length).\nBecause we already made the assumption above,'m' and 'n' can be dropped. From the question, the total time is 10 minutes, which is the time taken to make popcorn and fries.\nThe total time is what?\nThe total time is the addition of time spent on each movie and the time to make popcorn.

We know Mark has a combined 50 days of workdays, but we need to figure out how many hours this is. We do this by finding a combination which totals 85 hours, assuming 8 hours equate to 1 day.\n3. A quick formula is 85 / 8 = 10.625 which can then be rounded to 11.\n4. Thus, Mark has 10.6 vacation days left which equates to 11 days.\n\n### Input/Response/Rationales:\n\nInput: A good employee at a restaurant is what?

Other choices like courteous, diligent and pleasant are not typically included in the list at good workers.\n(3.) When the question asks for some particular trait that is necessary for a good worker, the choices do not encompass or include the option.\n(4.) It is very likely that the owner, or manager would expect workers to be on time/punctual, so when they ask for a punctual worker, it is obvious which answer is correct, A: pleasant worker.\n\n###  Input: Is that a lollypop or something else?

{"text": "The third section must add up to 160 cm, so the length of the third segment, s, in cm, is s = 160 - 90 - 50 = 20 cm. \n\n### Response Rationale:\nFirst consider the two segments with lengths 40 cm and a length of 40 cm from the answer. We recognize that the answer is 20 cm (since its value is less than 40 cm and greater than 10 cm) so 50 is the sum of 40 plus 10.\nNow consider 40 + 40. Since a triangle is formed when three segments intersect at a right angles, each segment makes a 90\u00b0 angle with the other two segments.\n\nIf 40\u00b0 is a right angle then 180\u00b0 - 40\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\nWhen the three segments are 40cm, 40 cm, and 10cm, the sum of the angles in the triangle must be 180cm. Therefore, 50cm is added to 40cm, which makes 90cm, or a 90\u00b0.\n\n### Input 1: \nA few days after 6 July 2021, a man made a request to the online marketplace eBay for a \"Nordic knife\".

If 10 were blue gill and the \nremainder were trout, h\now much more must \nhe save before he can buy his game?\n\n#### Answer Choice Explained:\nThe question starts by saying Bucky earns money, catches and sells fish each weekend. He knows last weekend he earned $50. This week he will be catching 5 fish and selling 2 for $5, or a total of $40. However, he is not sure how much money he is going to make this time. Now Bucky needs to make sure he has enough money to buy the game he wants.\n\nThere are two types of fish: blue gill & trout. If blue gill sell for $2 and trout sell for $1 than Bucky makes 46% more on trout, if he sells all trout. This works out to selling $35. He makes 6/60 times $35, which is 5.1.

{"text": "Tony will have driven 10 miles after he's driven around for his errands for 5 miles, because that's half the distance from groceries to the doctor's appointment.\n### Rationales:\nThe first thing to note is to determine the distance between the grocery store and the doctor's appointment, so that we have a clear picture of the situation. The question only gives us so much information, so we must take additional time to think about the structure of this problem.\nIn this case, the question is asking to calculate the distance Tony has driven after he's been driving for half of his errands.\nWe know that he's driven 10 miles to buy groceries. After this, he needs to go 15 miles to the haircut. From there, he needs to go a further 5 miles to the house for the doctor's appointment with 10 miles left to total 30 miles.\nTo arrive at the halfway point, we need to use half of 30. Mathematically,.5 x 30 = 15. Tony only needs to drive for the other 25 miles. Tony has now accumulated 30 miles. So, how do we know then that Tony has driven half of 30 during his first two errands? This is because we know that Tony got groceries and the haircut first.\nThis means that we know that Tony has driven all the way past halfway for his first errand. The halfway point is the grocery store in this scenario. After Tony reached two quarters of the way for groceries, he went to the haircut, which was still less than half of the journey. To arrive at the halfway for his third errand on top of the two he's already made, he reached that halfway point at 5 miles.\nThis means that Tony has driven approximately 38 miles in total after reaching the grocery store at 10 miles. \n\nNote: Tony can never drive the full 40 miles to the doctor from here.

{"text": "Rationales: 1-Saving $600 per year is equivalent to saving $150 per month. This means that $150 is equal to the amount saved per month in the first seven months ($10) multiplied by 12 (the months in a year). 2-To find the total amount of money saved over the course of the year, multiply the amount saved per month by the number of months in the year. This can be expressed as follows: $$ Total Saved = \\frac{Savings per month \\times \\text{Number of months in year}} = \\frac{$10 \\times 7 \\times 12)}{ \\times 12} = $150. 3-The key to solving this question is to identify the relationship between the savings per month and the number of months in a year.

She knows each dress takes 4 sq. m of fabric and 3 hrs to make. It takes her 3 hrs to assemble each dress. How many hours does Melissa ___ in making the dresses?\n\nRationales:  1. According to the question and background information, Melissa knows she has 56 sq. m of fabric; she knows it takes 4 sq. meters of each dress and 3 hours to produce a dress. Therefore, she can calculate how many dresses she can make with 56 square meters. The result of this calculation is 4 dresses.\n2. The next step is to find the amount of time it takes Melissa to make a dress (4 hrs).\n3. We know that it takes 3 hrs to produce or complete a dress (this is a known constant).\n4. Therefore, it takes Melissa 1 hr to make a dress and it takes 1 hr to complete a dress.\n5. The question asks Melissa how many hours she has to work to make the dresses.\n6.

A, \"one day per week,\" refers to a single day in a week instead of a cumulative number of days, which doesn't fit the context of the question.\n8. B, \"two days per week\", refers to a weekend, which does not apply to the question as the question explicitly specifies about a regular week which is defined as five days long.\n9. C, \"two days per a week,\" the number two is used as the numerator and is subtracted from seven as the denominator.

So our estimate for the number of blue candys would be one of the following: 8, 9, 12 or 13. However, we know that the number of blue candles cannot be less than the number of red candles. So our answer would need to be 4 less than the number of blue candy in any of these options. Since we know that the total number of candles is 80, this would mean that either 1 or 13 remained. Let\u2019s work backwards and check our options of 8 yellow candys and 4 blue candys to calculate the number left over: 24 (8 yellow) + 4 (blue) can easily be solved for 32 left, so that doesn\u2019t work. However, 13 yellow candys and 1 blue candy would calculate to 84, that matches the total calculated in the question to be 80.

If Jean takes 1 pack of 15 cupcake each to each child (1 + 3 x 15) = 50 children, she would still have 50 extra cupcakes with her.

Since he has 8 people and 64 to 8 is 4 to 8, then there are 8 people. Antonio will receive 4 pounds of meat, meaning he'll receive a total of eight (4 to 8) meatballs.

{"text": "The question asks for the total number of chocolate and vanilla chips Viviana and Susana have altogether. Since the total number of choco chips Viviana has is 20 and for Susana the total number of vanilla chips she has is 25, Viviana has 2 choco chips more than Susana, but we know that Viviana has 5 more chocolate than Susana (she has a total of 27 choco chips). This can be rearranged to find the total number of chocoa chips they have together:  27 +  5 >  25 +  2, so all of the choco chips they have added together is the sum of their individual tallies, which is 32 choco chips. So the total number of chippies they have together is 52, where 52 - 2 (the number of chocolate chips they have altogether) - 5 (the number of choco chocolate chips each individual has over the other) = 45, or 52 when rounded down.\n\n###\n### Response 2:\n\nThe best answer to get Viviana and Susana's total number of choc/vanilla chips together is to divide the total number by 5 because the number 5 divides both Viviana and Susana\u2019s individual chip totals. First, we can find Susana\u2019s vanilla chips total if we know Viviana\u2019s chocolate chip total:\n\n$\\frac{20}{5}=4$\n\nViviana\u2019s total for vanillas thus becomes 25 - 4 = 21.

{"text": "120000\n\n### Explanation:We can understand the question by breaking it down into its parts. 1.Cadence worked for her new company for a period that is 5 times the length of the time she worked for her old one. Therefore, the work period of her old company = old work period * 5 = new work period. 2.Since Cadence earned $5000/month at the old company, and now makes $20% more, the salary at the old company ($5000) * 20% = $1000. 3.Now, since she's worked at the old company for 3 yrs, and new for 3 months, we can add the years together and multiply by the salary for that year. $3yr * $5000 = 150000, and $3month * $1000 = 3000. Therefore, the total amount of money Cadence has earned from both companies is: $15000 + $3000 = $18000.

{"text": "The correct answer to this question is H: 80, which is the number of people at Ryan's party. We can find this answer by following the following steps: 1. Read the question carefully and identify the information: The question states that Ryan's party was 960% of the size of Taylor's party. To find the size of Ryan's party, multiply Taylor's party size (which is 20) by 1.96 (since 96 x 100 = 960). Thus, 20 x 1.96 = 38, so Ryan's party had 38 people. A similar process can be used to find the number of people at Taylor's party. \n\n2. Divide the two values: Divide Ryan's party size (38) by the size of Taylor' s party (which we just found to be 20), to find the ratio of Ryan's party size to Taylor's party size: 38/20 = 1.9, so the two parties are the same size, with 1.9 times more people at Taylor's than at Ryan's. 3. Use the information from step 1 and 2 to complete the statement: The two parties combined totaled 26. So Ryan's party would have had 13 more people than Taylor's birthday, 13/20 = 0.65, and Ryan's party would be that percentage of the total number of guests. Since the total number of guests was 220, Ryan's party would contain 80 people by that same calculation. Answer: H: 80", "answer": " 192"}

For this, we have: 4 pages X 2 = 8 pages per week.\n*We then multiply 8 pages per week by how many pages he writes in a year. 8 pages X 365 days = 2,910 pages a year.\n### Rational:\nWe are left with the choice between 2,912 and 2,913. Either is mathematically possible, but 2,911 is an impossible answer, which makes 2,914 an unlikely answer. We pick the most likely answer. \n\nWe first solve for how many weeks in a year. We have 52 weeks a year = 52 X 7 = 364 weeks in a year. Since the question says twice a week on average, we multiply 364 X 2 = 728 weeks per year.\nWe then subtract 52 days in each week. Since weekends do not count, we subtract the weekend of Saturday and Sunday. Since we subtract every weekend of that year, there is 251 weekends a year, which is 26 weeks each year.\nWe subtract 728 X 26 = 18,432 weeks. We finally subtract two days for every weekend of that 18,452 weeks to get 1,728 weeks. We now find how many pages per week based on the page size.\nThis answer is 886 pages per week.

Rationales]: We see that there are a total of four gnomes on the third house and since we have assumed that they have been equally distributed on all the previous houses, we need to distribute 4 gnomes on the 5th house.\n- [3. Rationales]: So, to conclude, we now have 21 gnomes.\n\n### How would you improve your response?\n- [1.] I would have shown more steps as to how I reached the solution.

{"text": "Mr. Benson paid $(239.5 + 12(4 - 0.05)) = $469.40 to see concert.\n\n### Input \n\nWe can look at this question from different angles. If $40 is the standard price for a single ticket, for buying 12 tickets, the total price would be $480. So, why did we get that number, it is because each ticket cost $40 and discount is for each ticket purchased in bulk, so, (12 - 10 = 2, hence the discount = 5% of 2 tickets), so, subtracting the discount of 5% as 2 tickets and the total price is $480, so (480 - $5 = $475). Hence, we got that $475. \n\nSo, we multiplied $40 x 12 (12 tickets) and we got $480, therefore, Mr. Benson paid $480 for 12 concert tickets. We have to subtract discount of 5 % x (12 - 2), that means (12 - 8), so 5 % x 8 tickets and we got $475, additionally we added value of original ticket and Mr. Benson paid total of $475 + $40 = 515. \n\n### \n<br>\n\n#### In this lesson, you will learn to construct and execute a program that performs a given task.\n#### A task is generally a statement that specifies an instruction or solution to a problem.\n#### In a task, the instructions should be appropriate, well formed, and properly structured. \n#### The task statement requires at least two operations.

We need to begin the task by breaking down the information in the question into its most logical and relevant parts.\n\n3. Leo's assignment is divided into three parts.\n4. Leo finished the first part of the assignment in 25-minutes.\n5. Leo spent twice as long to finish his assignment when working on the second part.\n\n6. Leo finished the assignment in 2-hours.\n\n7. Based on the information given above, we can deduce the following facts:\n8. Leo finished the first task in 25 minutes - let's call this part A.\n9. Leo spent two hours to finish his assignment - let's call it part B.\n10. Part C, the final part of Leo's assignment, consists of the remaining time after part A is cleared.\n\n11. The information given indicates that Leo finished part A in 25 minutes; in other words, he was able to clear part A in 2-hunred / 25 = 8 minutes.\n12. Therefore, part A's time = 8 minutes. Taking part B, which is two hours, that means part A + part B = two hours and eight minutes.\n13. So, part B was taken, which is 108 minutes = 0.167 hours = 16.7 minutes.

(I would rather have this number formatted but I was unable to due to the fact that the number I got was in a weird format and not able to copy and paste properly). Her total bike payments = $400 + $40 interest (interest rate of 10%). To me, it looks like $8/hr is for the whole hour instead of the total amount she works so I multiplied $8/hr by 35hours to find her total gross pay for the week. Next we need to find the total number of weeks in a month, but I was able to figure that out by taking $400/week and dividing it by $400/bike. The number of weeks is 10. We can now find our total bike payments by multiplying our gross bike pay by our number of weeks in a bike and adding the interest so our total bike pay= = $400 times 10 weeks = $4000 times 110% = $4400. We get to subtract the gross pay left over but that will only be possible after we find our total gross pay for the month. So how much is the gross pay left over?

{"text": "His food cost was \\$38.\n\n### Explained:\nThe costs of the food are $4 for the sandwich, $7 for the juice, and $8 for the milk, which leaves a total of $25. If 75% of $25 is \\$18.75, this would be the price of the sandwich and the juice. A bottle of juice is twice as expensive as the total sandwich and juice combination. The total cost of the juice is then \\$37.50. The sandwich is $4 cheaper than the total cost of the juicer, so George would have spent $33 for the sandwich. Subtracting the $33 from the total cost of this food would give you $15 left over for the milk. The total cost of milk is $4 + $4/3.\n\nOption C is the only other choice that considers the milk and the total costs of the juice and the sandwich and that is $4 plus 4/3 of $37.50, which is $16.25. Subtracting $15 leaves $1.25. The answer becomes $33 for sandwich+ $1.25 for milk, which equals $34.25.\n\nChoices must equal a value less than or equal to the total, because otherwise we've already solved for how much the total cost is.

{"text": "Kris is 10 years older than Herbert so Herbert will be 24 this year - 10= 19 next year\n\n### Rationale:When choosing a response to a question, it is essential to consider the structure of the question and whether there are any clues that will help you determine the correct answer. In this example, we can see that the structure of the question is straightforward, with \"Himself is 10 years\" and \"If Kris is 25 years old now, how many years old will Herbert be next\"? The question is asking us to compare the ages of 2 people.\n\n### We can assume that Herbert is the younger of the 2 individuals, as the question asks us to determine which Herbert is 10 years \"younger\". This can be inferred from the language used in the question: \"Herbert is 12 years younger than Kris\".\n\n### The clue given in the question is \"Kris is 25\". This indicates that Kris is the older of the 2 individuals. We can make this assumption because Kris is 10 older than Herbert, so Herbert must therefore be the younger of the 3 people. This is also shown in the question where it states that the younger person is 12 years \"younger\" than the elder one.\n\nIn response to this question, I decided to check if Herbert's birth year minus Kris' birt year would give me the correct number I needed. I then went on a site that asked me what Kris's and Herbert's birth years were and compared the 2 dates to come up with an answer that matched the question.\n\nAnswer: Herbert will be 23 years old next year", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "If each scroll is older by half as many years than the last scroll's age, the fifth scroll is therefore 8140 - 4080 = 4080 - 2040 = 2040 years old.\n\n### Rationale:\nA library cabinet houses five scrolls. Each is designated to be at least 4080, or more than 2040, years old. We are told that the first scroll's age is 408, and we want to determine the age of the fifth scroll. (Note that this is different than earlier problems where answers don't exist, but the relationship of them does exist.)\n\nThe question states that each scroll is older than its predecessor by half as many years, meaning that it is 50% more than the year the scroll before it came into existence.\n\nTherefore, we know that each scroll must be 50% more in years than 4080. We can use this to determine the year of each scroll in chronological order.\n\nWe know that the fifth scroll is 8140 years (50% more) older than the second scroll, which is 4088.\n\nSince the fourth scroll and the fifth scroll both have 8140 in years and are 50% older than the second scroll in age, they both had to be made exactly 1308 years ago. (8140 - [50% more than 4088])\n\nSince each scroll is 50% older by the previous scroll's age, each is 2048 years more than 4014 [50% older by 4080] years old.\n\nTherefore we can determine the year of each of the scrolls by the number of its position in chronological order. We know the fifth scroll is 50 years more than the second scroll's age, so it is 8148 - 4088 = 4060 years old.\nIn other words, each scroll is exactly as old as the number of years that separate from the age of each previous scroll.\n\nTherefore the fourth scroll must be 5424 years old [1308 years older than the second scroll], the third scroll must be 476", "answer": " 20655"}

{"text": "31 years old\n\n### Rationale:  The key to solving the puzzle below lies in understanding the givens and formulating appropriate questions that lead to desired information and insights. The first step is to identify what is given in the puzzle and what is being sought.\nThe puzzle explains that Jolene and Phil had four children: A-D. They gave birth to A at exactly 15 years and each of their children has the same birthday. They also give birth to their second child at exactly one year after the first, their third child on the birthday of their second, and their fourth child after two years of their third child.\nThe task is to determine how old is the fourth child.\nThe first question to determine how old is their fourth child would be: How old were Jolene and Phil when they gave birth to A? As the fourth child is born two years after the third child, Jolene and Phil would be 38 when they gave birth to the fourth child.\nThis information is necessary for identifying the birthday of the fourth child.\nFor example, the birthday of their fourth child could be on A's birthday. This would mean the children are born 15 years apart, which is not possible. It would have to the children's birthday after A's birthday and before their other siblings.\nThe fourth child could not be born on their last month of giving birth as they were 38 years old when they gave birth to D, not 36 and not 39.\nAs Jolene and Phil gave birth to D, the fourth child would have to be born on the birthday of C. C is born two years after A. The birthdays of A-C are 15, 16 and 17 years apart.\nThe birthday of the fourth \nchild could not be on C's birthday. However, C's birthday is six years after A's birth day and four years after A's second birthday. The fourth child could also be born on C's birth day. It wouldn't be possible for the fourth child to be born on D's birthday as they would be 39 when they gave birth to C and 41 when C dies. \n\nThe conclusion is that their fourth child is nine to ten years old, depending on when exactly a", "answer": " 8"}

Then he loses $276 so now he has $364 left.\n\n### Explanation:\nInitially Jake has $5,00 because $5000 - $ 2800 = $ 2200 and then spends $1400 on a $1000 concert ticket from $2200 because $2200 - $200 = $2000. Then he spents $3.23 on gas. Then he loses half of what's lef to get 256.\n\n### Inputs: The teacher gave an exercise to the class, she explained that she'd give a $100 prize for the best solution. She told them to be creative.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. One of the first points the teacher mentions is a $100 reward. The $100 reward implies that the task requires an amount of effort and skill necessary to be the best.\n2. The teacher also said to be creative, which implies the teacher is looking for the best but most impressive or creative way to get it.\n3. Thus, given these points, one knows that the task must require some amount of skill and effort, and that its solution must likely be most creative to be best.\n4. Based on these points, the task is likely an art-related task, specifically related to creativity.\n5. The teacher is likely looking for the most artistic and creative solution.\n6. Among the given choices: A: sketch B: drawing C: painting D: essay E: poem F: play G: sculpture, the choices'sketch' and 'drawing' could probably refer to sketching or drawing. Thus, A: sketch is the best option, however, it is not necessarily the creative medium the teacher requires.\n7. Likewise, the choices 'p", "answer": " 825"}

The shark will eat only live prey. 5. The shark is not capable of eating larger prey. 6. The shark is extremely deadly when it is hungry.\n\n### Response:\"The shark is not capable\" of eating larger preys.\n\n### Feedback:I think the feedback shows how the answer is \"The shark is not able to\" eat larger prey. Also, the explanation is to support the option that talks about the shark's inability to eat larger prey. This is supported by the fact that the shark is described to be capable of feeding only on \"small\" prey. This option would therefore seem more plausible for the statement that the shark \"has been known to eat\" anything \"in one gulp\". Hence, there is more evidence to support the option.\n\n### Explanation: The question asks for the best choice from a series of six options to satisfy the criteria indicated by the information given.\nThe choices are:\n1. The shark has killed many small creatures in one gulp.\n2. The shark would need to swallow small creatures to be able to eat them.\n3.

{"text": "The best response for this instruction is:\n\nEighty\n\nOption B, four feet: The question contains an equation. It says that Farmer Brown has eighty emus in his flock. To arrive at what that means, we need to do a bit of division. The emus in Farmer Brown's flock have 60 heads. Additionally, the emus also have 40 legs (60 \u2013 20). The formula for division of fractions is to multiply top and bottom by the same number to make them whole numbers. So, 80 heads and 40 legs divide into eighty emus equally for a total of 80 birds. Thus, the answer to the question, \"How many emus?,\" is 80.\n\nOption D, two legs per emu: There are several ways this answer can go wrong. Firstly, it is not correct to simply assume there are two legs per emu. The question explains that there are 40 legs, which means two legs per emu is not necessarily the case. Secondly, even if there are two legs per bird, the number is not simply two. Instead, the number is eighty \u2013 two legs to a bird.

We subtract this from 2 hours to find the time spent cleaning her room.\n\nSince there are 2 separate choices of hours, either option (C or D) can be eliminated as \"5\" hours would cover \"both these tasks\".\n\nRound all the numbers up or down until you get the exact answer.\n\n### Input 2:Rachel has the world record for high jumping. After she broke the record for 10 consecutive times, could she break the record for high jumping 13 more times?\n\n### Demostration 2:\nInput: 10 consecutive times\nOutput: Yes.\n\nInput: 13 more times \nOutput: No.\n\n10 consecutive times is no more than 13 more times. So the answer is no.\n\n### Output:\nThe answer is no as Rachel had already broken the record 10 consecutive times before. She can only break the record 10 more times, which is less than 13.\n\n### Rationale 1:\nWe can tell what Rachel did in each instance by checking out each one of the given choices.\n1, Rachel got the record.\n2, Rachel broke the record.\n3, Rachel broke the world record.\n4, Rachel broke the 10 times consecutive world record.\n5, Rachel broke the same world record that she broke 10 times before.\n6, Rachel broke the previous record.\n\nBy the time she broke the record for the tenth time, her record was no longer 'previous' since she broke the same record 10 times. We can therefore eliminate these options as the scenario being described.\n\n### Conclusion: \nRachel can break the record 13 more times since 13 is still less than 10.", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": "She had 237 grams of rice left.\n\nThe following statement: \u201cRose had 150 grams of rice left\u201d is a logical conclusion to the following statement: \u201cShe ate part of the rice from the morning and then left 150 gr in the evening.\u201d The answer is either (A) true or (B) obviously false. (A) can be narrowed down to (C) 100 gr, or (B) can be narrowed to (D) true or (E) false. If you use Rule #2, you could also narrow down to (A) or (B).\n\nThe question is asking for a number of rice left in grams. Therefore, the answer must be expressed in grams or kilograms. There is a value of 150 gr after she ate portion of the rice and left 150gr, which is gram for 100/10 = 10,kg. So, 150gr /2 = 75gr, and 2/3 75gr = 33.33. The rest of the rice is 1/3, i.e., 1/4 of 10,kg or 7.5 kg. 7.5 + 33.3 =20.8, which reduces to an integer by 0.8. 20.8/1.5 grams = 13.76. 1376/10 kilogr = 137.6 kilograms. Hence, answer is (A) 137.5 kg.\n\n### Inputs: There aren\u2019t any cakes in the fridge.\n\n### Rationales: There aren\u2019t no cakes in the fridges.\n\nAn input to an inference engine is a collection of predicates and arguments. Thus, the input should correspond to an argument in the predicate that begins with no or has no. (A) is obviously true but not applicable because the first sentence does not have any predicate beginning with has or has no. This suggests (B) and (C) are irrelevant, and that (D) should be considered.

{"text": "Reggie will lose how many points? \n\nThere are some things to note about the rules of the game:\n- A single shot can either be a layup, a free throw, or a long shot. All points are accumulated on a shot-by-shot basis, so if a player misses any shots, the points they have already scored are not affected. \n\n- It is worth noting the difference between layups, free throws, and long shots. A layup is when the player shots from within approximately 1-foot away from the basket (the area immediately inside the three-point line). A free throw is when a player shoots the ball from just below the basket, while a long shot is when a player shoos the ball from outside the three-point line. The differences in score in these categories suggest that they are awarded different points.\n- Given the score at the end of the game, we know that Reggie shot 10 layups, 2 free throws, and one free throw. We also know that his brother shot 10 long shots. \n\n- The question asks for how many points Reggie lost by. This can be answered by first finding out how many points he got, then subtracting that from the points his brother got. This is because the question specifically says he is losing points and not adding points, so there is no need to add the point value of both players to get the overall sum.\n\n- Reggie shot 13 shots, where he was worth 1 and every free throw was worth 2 points. Since he did not make any free throws, he lost all the points from being worth 2 points. The total amount of points he lost by is -12 points.\n- Alternatively, we can also find the difference between the two players by subtracting the points scored by each player. This indicates that Reggie had a total of -24 points whereas his brother had a total of 12 points, resulting in a total diffrance of -36 points.", "answer": " 2"}

As Emily starts with 6 marbles, she has to make two exchanges in order to double the original number:\n\n1.Emily trades one marble for 2 marbles. This exchanges one marble for two.\n\n2.Emily trades 2 marbles for 4 marbles. This exhanges 2 marbles for four.\n\nIn total, Emily has to exchange 1 marble for 8 in order to double her original number to 12.\n\nMegan, being the one to give Emily the initial 4 marbles to even up her 6 to a 12, then received 6 marbles plus 1 from Emily. She started with 4 marbles plus one which is 5 then takes these 5 marbles and gives Emily half of them (3) then takes 2 of those marbles and gives it to Emily, leaving herself with 0. \n\nTo find the answer, we follow how many marbles Emily had at each step of the exchanges:\n\n1. 6 marbles\n2. 12 marbles\n3. 6 marbles (the total Emily keeps)\n4. 0 marbles (the total Megan keeps)\n\nEmily begins with 6 marbles and adds 2 after exchanging with Megan.

{"text": "If Frankie wins half the amount of games Carla won, this can be expressed with this formula: (Carla + 10) - (Frankie + 5) = Number of Carla games won\nSo in order for Frankie to always win half as much as Carla, the number of Carla's game wins must be at least 15.  The minimum number that works out is 20.  20 - 15 = 5  So, Carla must have won at least 20 games.\n\nIf Carla won 20 games, then Frankie would have needed to have won at least 5 games in order to not lose all of them.  But 5 < (Carla + 5)\nAlso, 5 < (Carlos + 5)\nSo, if Frankie won 5 games, then Carla must have won more than 20 games.  20 + 5 = 25  So 25 - 5 = 20  To determine the maximum number of games Carla could win without Frankie winning any, you need to solve the equation 20 = (Frankie + 10)\nThus, it's possible that Carla could have won up to 20 games. So 20 + 5 > 20.

{"text": "Michael originally had 70-matchsticks. Because he intended to only use half of the original amount, he originally had 70 matchsticks minus 35 matchsticks, which equals 35 matchstick. He then decided to only use 35 matchsticke and made 30 matchstick houses. Now, the amount of matchsticks he intends to use is 35-30, which equals 5 matchsticks. To make 30 of each matchstick houses, he used 10 matchstick houses since each house took 10 matchsticky.\nTherefore, he has 5 matchsticks now and used 10 houses in total, which equals 30 matches. So, the original amount of matchsticks Michael had was 70-30. Hence, he intended to only use 70 matchstick houses and had 70 plus or minus 35. So, 70 initially minus his 30 matchstiks already made equals 35 remaining, which means he was able to make 35 matchstike houses.

The question will use $600 and $340 to buy a gaming console. It will also inform you the hours spent on repairing the car. With this information in mind, we can determine what Sam made during those specified months. \n\n$$23 \\times 600\\text{ (games console)} + 460 \\times 10 = 17960$$ Sam made for 23 hours of work. Therefore, the total number of hours he spent was 330 hours. Let's assume he started working in March and the question will give us the information based on specific month. Let's do that first. In the case he started in March, he can calculate how many hours he worked from March to July.\n\n#### March-April-May-June-July-August-September-October-November-December-January-February ( 1,855.50 working hours )\n\nAnd so if you take that number and subtract the total number of hours worked (330), you may get the answer to how many hours he wants to work on until he buys another item.

The answer to question4 is ate which can be defined as\"to put solid food into one's mouth.\" \n5. The answer to question is sat which is used to express the idea of being or resting one's body in a particular position, especially one that is not lying down.\n6. Therefore the answer in this task is #1.The question: Which of the choices below is not a verb? 1. Ate 2. Drank 3. Swam 4. Sung 5. Sat\nRational: 1.The answer to question 1 is#5. The question: Which of the choice below is not a verb. 1. Ate (verb) 2. Drank (verb) 3. Swam (verb) 4. Sung (verb) 5. Sat ( verb).\n\nReasoning: We begin by analyzing the question to locate the grammatical error. The error is in the use of \"not a verb\" grammatically, rather than \"not is a verb.\". The question indicates that the choice that \"is not a verb\" should be selected, indicating that it could be a noun.\nNow, let us examine the grammatical rules for verbs.\n1.Verbs are action words, they can also be defined as, a word that shows an action\n2.", "answer": " 50"}

He then sold it to his friend. What this means is that his friend took what he had and got what he wanted. \n\nSince there were 894lbs of force there, and he took it and gave it to his friend. He took what the artist had and received 10.1555124224 pounds of force from it. (This is the way i got). The 8.94 x 1.24 (which is the weight in pounds for 8.94 lbs).

{"text": "The total number of commencement addresses is equal to the sum of the total number of addresses given by each governor divided by the total number of addresses of each governor.\n\n### Rationale and Solution:\n\nSince Governor Sandoval doubled the number of addresses given by Governor Hawkins, we now know that there was a total of 24 commencement addresses given. In comparison, Governor Sloan gave 10 more addresses than Governor Sandoval. Since each governor gave 12 addresses in their first term, we now also know that there was a sum of 36 addresses given by all three of them.\n\nThe solution now comes down to the division portion of how many commencement addressed were given altogether, so we can now get an answer with the formula: Total commencement addresses = Governor Hawkin\u2019s address number + (double = Governor Sandolns address number + (total = 10) ) = 24 addresses.\n\nSince we know there were a total of 36 addresses, we can solve for X in the equation to get an answer of 12 for each governor\u2019s addresses in one term.\n\nSince they all gave 12 commemorations in their first term, it is fair to deduce that they gave 36 for the entire of their first term.\n\nGovernor Hawkins has 76 addresses in total, Governor Sandoval has 144, and Governor Sloan has 216 addresses in total.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: 5 \u00f7 4 == what number?

Only 25%(0.25) of all the pairs get pregnant after they mate. If they each give birth to one baby, how many pandas will be born?\n\n## Demonstration\nWe need to find the number of babies pandas give birth to when we are given how many pairs of pandas have babies.\nThe pairs need to have at least one baby.\nWe can start with the easy cases. If 1 or 2 pairs do not have any babies, it is easy to see that we have 0 panda babies.\nWe then move on to the case where exactly one pair has 2 babies and exactly one pair has 1 baby. We can find the number of such pairs without going through all the possibilities. We know that the number of pairs of pandas that have 2 babis must be at least as large as the number of pairs that have one baby. We also know the total number of pandas = 16 - 1. We can divide both sides by 25% and find that the number of pairs where each pandas has 2 babis equals 16 / 25= 0.64, and the number of pairs where one pandas has 2 babbis must be at least 0.64.\n\nWe therefore now can solve for n that the number of pairs that each pandas has 2 cubies where n=0.64+0.0225 and that the number of pairs are 16 \u2013 (0.64+16/25) = -0.0016 + 2, we can find the number of pandas that give birth to a total of 9 cubes by the same procedure.\n\n## Demonstratin Problem:\nGiven an array primes, and an integer limit.

{"text": "Andy will be twice as older than Rahim in 5 years, by the following math equation: 1 + 1/2 = 3. So, Andy is 3 years older than Rahim.\n\n### Input\n\nThe following math questions do not follow a specific format, but require logical reasoning on the part of the respondent in order to arrive at the correct response.\n\nInput: In 5 months, the tree grew 12 feet, in 12 months it grew 144 feet. How much did the tree grow in 4 months? Choices: A: 24 feet B: 36 feet C: 48 feet D: 60 feet E: 72 feet\n\nDemonstration:\n1. The question asks how much the tree grew in \"4 months.\" \n2. The tree grew 12 and 144 feet in 5 and 12 months, respectively, which gives us the following equation: 12 + 12*5 = 144 + 12*12.\n3. From this, we can conclude that the tree grew 144 + (12*12) = 180 + 144 feet = 324 feet in 12 months.\n4. Therefore, in 4 months, since the tree grew 24 feet in 5 months, it will grow 24*(4/5) or 36*1/5 feet in 4 months.\n5. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:\nD: 36 feet.\n\n### Other math responses:\n\nInput: There are 14 people in a conference. Half of these people speak English.

{"text": "It's hard to work out the precise number of requests remaining, but we can narrow it down with the following equation: remaining = (starting + 4 + 5 - 6) / 5\n\nThus, the remaining requests at the end of a day = (6 + 4 + 1)/5 = 5\n\nThose 5 requests are divided into 4 work days and 1 spare day = 5 / 4 = 1.25 remaining requests\nThose 1.25 requests are divided over 5 work days = 1.2 / 5 = 0.24 requests remaining\n\nTherefore, after 5 work days, Maia would have 0.24 client requests remaining.\nAnswer: 0.24\n\n### Demostration:\nMaia receives 6 client requests per day.\nMaia works on 4 of them each day.\nAfter 4 days, there will only be 6 requests remaining, so Maia will not work on anything that fifth day.\nTherefore, if it takes Maia 5 days to write all those requests, she will have 0.25 client requests remaining on the fifth day.\nAnswer: 25\n\nInput: 2673=6500 x A \u00f7 7475 = B \u00d7 8985-3436 = C A: 5 B: 8 C: 1\nRationales:\n\n1.

However, since we know that they go to Hawai'i a lot, it's hard to say many other places.

The question is about \"the number of skips completed Jeff in each round.\"\n2. We can use the word \"competed\" with the verb \"completed\".\n3. With that in mind, we must also know how many times Sam finished each round to calculate the average number of skipping by Jeff.\n4. Sam did 1 more skips than Jeff in the first (1) round. Jeff did 3 fewer skips than Sam in the second (2) round. Jeff did also 4 more skips than Sam in third (3) round, so in the fourth or final round, Jeff did half the number that Sam did, so Jeff only completed half of Sam's skips.\n5. After we know how many skips each subject did in each round, we have the number of skips needed to calculate the average.\n6.

He borrows about 40% more books from the library on Fridays than on average. This means he borrows about 54 books per week from the library. There are five days in the week that he goes to the library, so he goes to the library 5 days out of 7. So he borrows books for 5 days out of a week.\n\n#### Solution: Krystian borrows books at an average rate of 4 books per day and at the rate of 40% higher on Fridays.

Since he goes to the library every day, so his borrowings would range from 40 books per week to 54 books per.\n\nTo find the per-week borrowings, we can just sum up all week's borrowings and divide the total by the number of week.

{"text": "There are 180 goats in total.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The question is about how many goats Paddington and Washington added, it asks for an answer involving the total number of goats they both end up with.\n2. To figure out the overall number of goats, we must start with how many each character has at the beginning of the math equation, as Paddington's overall number of goats is found out in the answer.\n3. So, let's begin with Paddington. Paddington has 4 goats more than Washington. The given answer is that Paddington's goats are 40 more than Washington's.\n4. 40 means 4 x 10 = 40. 40 means that each one has 40 goats more than the other.\n5. If each one has 4 goats plus 40 goats, then the total number of goat for that person is: 1+4+40.\n6. When we add up both the numbers, 50 plus 40, we have: 90 goats.\n7. That's why, the overall number of goat we have is 90 goats in total in that situation.\n8. The same approach we used for Paddington's number of goat. Washington gets 140 goat by himself, which is 15 fewer than the total goat he and Paddington have.\n9. 15 more goats equals 10 with the given amount of goats being 40.\n10. So, the total number of goa for the two characters are: 40 + 10, making it 50 altogether.\n11. However, one might say, what about the 59th goat, that is also present in the question. \n12. Well, the extra question does not play a role in determining the overall number of goa in the two characters.\n13. That's why it is not necessary to include it in the answer.\n14. Therefore, the answer for Washington goats is an easy 140 and overall 90 goats for both characters are the answer.\n\nAnswer: 90 goat\n\n### Input:\"", "answer": " 320"}

You would want to focus your answer on how many clown fish ended up in the display tank.\nStep 2: Break the question down into a math problem\n  It can easily be observed that the question has a simple equation: the fish in the display tank = the fish in the original display tank (26) + the fish that originally returned (1/3 of the fish) + the fish that enter the display tank (the remaining clownfish) - the fish that leave the display tank (the blowfish)\nStep 3: Decide what type of equation or formula you need and then complete it\nSince the question is a simple equation, you can either choose a mathematical equation or a set of ordered terms.\nStep 4: Solve for what the question is asking you to answer for\n  You can now put the right amount of symbols and signs in the appropriate places to solve the equation and get a value for the quantity you need, that is, the number of clown fish remaining in the display tank (and therefore the answer)\nIf all 4 steps are taken in this way, then a correct answer will be found for any type of reasoning skills question for college\n\n### Input The cats were in the box.  They had not been let out of the box. It was in the kitchen by the table. The box did not have food for the cats, but there was an empty cardboard egg carton with several holes in it.

{"text": "Since the turtle crawls 1 foot per second and the hare runs 10 feet per second, if they race 20 feet, the turtle has to run 10 units and the hare will run 100 units. For the turtle to finish in a tie with the hare, it will have to run its entire race first followed by the hare. Thus, the head start needed will be equal to the distance the turtle has over the hare. In other words, the turtle should start five (or more) seconds ahead of the hare to finish in a tie.\n\n#### Rationale:\n\n1. The first step was to determine how many seconds the turtle should be ahead of the hare.\n2. We started by understanding the relationship between the units traveled by the hare and those traveled by the turtle given the distances involved in the question. The hare covers 100 times more the turtle's distance, so it would have to have a head start of 100 times its distance to finish in a tie, which in this case would be 20 feet.\n3. Next, we examined the time it takes the hare to run that distance given the units per second (ft/s) he covers while running. Based on the information given, the hare's running speed works out to 10 units per second, because in the first second it runs 10 ft, in the second second it runs 11 ft, and so on.\n4. Then, we examined the same relation for the turtle, which crawls 1 unit every second, covering 10 units within a second.\n5. We used the running speed and distance of the hare and the crawling speed and distance of the turtle to determine that it would take the hare 20 units to cover the distance while the turtle takes 10 units to traverse the distance.\n6. With these units-per-second, we are required to determine how many seconds ahead the turtle would need to start to finish the race in a tie with the  hare.\n7. To know this we are required to know how many seconds ahead the hare needs to start to reach this distance in the same number of seconds as it takes the turtle to run", "answer": " 18"}

What's the most bags of sand John or Julie can each use? And 1 more.\n\n### Reponse:\nJulie  can use 10 of the bags. John can use 11 of the bags.\nIf they use one bag of sand, they can fill up the barrel in one day. So, they need 11+1=12 full days with both of the bags. The barrel has a capacity of 3. If they use one day to fill up the barrel, then the barrel will be filled 1/12 full for each day. So, if the barrel is filled halfway by two days, it will be full in 13 days, so they need 13 bags each. \n\n### Input ::The student took 13 tests. He received an average score of 95%. In what range of test scores does he fall?\n\n### Repsonse:\nThe student takes 13 tests and gets 95% on them.  That implies that the student did at least 13/95 or 13.6% of the tests.  That means that out of 13 tests, the student would have to get at least 13.6/2 of the total score. The score that the student got out of 2 tests was 95% of 2 or 95%. 13.6 \u00f7 2 is 6.8%, so the student has to have a score that is between 95% and 6.8%.", "answer": " 10"}

However, we now have the Chevys with 86 cars, which means that the Buick must have twice the amount of the Chevys to make up 102. \n\nOnce we have the Chevys, we see that there must be 25 more cars to make up the total cars listed.\n\nThus, Buicks would have 101 since there are 25 more cars besides the Chevys, and there is one Ford.\n\nSo the answer is 101.\n\n### Inputs:\n* What is the biggest star in our galaxy?\n* Choices:  A) Milky way  B) Andromeda  C) Magellanic  D) Our galaxy  E) Centaur \n* Which of the following was created by the Greeks?\n* Choices B) Astronomy  D) Geometry  E) Anthropology\n* Choice D) Who was the person", "answer": " 220"}

That would be the maximum number of toys which Bill would have had, making the total number of toys that the boys have to be 60+30=90.

{"text": "In order to solve this equation, first, we should determine exactly what the question is asking. Based on a careful reading of the question, we can deduce that we are given a scenario where five months ago Mike earned 10 * more * than Fred. In other words, Mike's monthly salary back then was 10 times more than Fred's monthly sal. In addition, we know that Mike's salary has increased by $40% when Fred's salary was $1002. This information gives us a hint that we can solve for Mike's monthly wage now. To solve for Mike's salary, it is helpful to create two equations involving four variables such as Mike's new salary, Fred's new salary and the time periods after and before Mike's salary was raised.\n\nThe first equation is as follows: \n$$ f = {10xm} $$\nSince we are told that $f = Fred's monthly wages and $x = Mike's monthly Wages, substituting for $f (10x) tells us that $f = x * 10 or $f = $10x; while $x = $f / 10. Equating the two, we have $x * 10 = 10x, or simply $10x = $10x, and we thus obtain $x = 1.\nThe second one is: $$M = {10x} \\:. $$\nSubstituting, as done in the previous equation, we get: $M = 10x\n\nNow we can make the two equations that we have set up equivalent by adding an equivalent: $$ 10xM = $10x  .$$  Combining like binomial terms, we see that $10x = 10x. $ The solution to this last equation is equivalent to $x = 1$.\n\nHaving established that f = 10 * x, then f = 10m, we can solve for Mike\u2019s wages, f, by multiplying both sides by m, to obtain: f = $10m.\nCombining like binoomials, the above equation yields:  $10m = $10m, or simply, m = 1", "answer": " 15400"}
{"text": "301 questions\n\n### Rationale:  The key information in this question is that Bob initially created 13 questions, so we know that Bob started with just 13 questions.  We can also deduct that Bob answered 3 questions per hour (assuming that he worked at the same initial rate for all 3 questions).  This means that Bob doubled his rate for each hour, but we are not told that he doubled his rate for his second hour.  Therefore, we just know that he doubled his first-hour-rate in the second hour (1x2=2) and doubled his second-hour-rate in his third hour (1x2x2=8).  Bob's third-hour rate ended up being 2^3 = 8.  So, Bob's rate tripled after his second hour, ending up at 2^3 (8).  From this, we can conclude that Bob had 3^3 (27) questions by the start of his third hour (1+2+8=11 questions).  We can also deduce that Bob did not create any additional questions in the second hour because if he had, this would've brought his total number of questions at the beginning of the third hour to 2^2 (4).\n\n### So, Bob had 27+4 = 301 questions.", "answer": " 91"}

Since the choice between \"bark\" and \"scream\" could be considered an error, let's assume one of the choices is correct and let the other one be wrong.\n\nThere is a subtle difference in meaning between \"bark\" vs. \"scream\" in this scenario.\nThe former suggests the sound made by a dog; the latter suggests loud cry, usually an emotional reaction to an event.\nTherefore, since the two have a different meaning, the question indicates which of the two reactions has the highest chance of frightening the bear.\n\nSince option A, \"scream\", suggests a more emotional reaction, suggesting the sound made by a person who may feel scared or is experiencing a disturbance. \n\nThus, the correct answer, which has the highest chance of helping one scare a bear away is option A.\nAnswer: A, scream\nInput: What was the name of the boy who got hit by a meteor?

{"text": "70\nInput: A group of teens in an accident, there were no adults. They all survived, however they had to walk home, so they took turns carrying the wounded or ill who could not leave the site of the crash. They all stayed together and got to a safe place. Which one of the following would be missing from the group? Choices: 1. A: Able bodies person 2. B: The injured 3. C: The ill 4. D: The weak 5. E: Anyone\nRationales: As all the members of the group survived and there were no adults amongst them, they are young, but have the capacity to carry the injured/ill persons. So, they would be the able bodies. The injured/ill are already carried. Thus, it's the weak/able bodies. This means that any person among them would have no reason to stay. \n\n### Sample Solution\n\nIn this case, we are given the options A through E. Among them, the least logical option is B, because it states that the injured are already being carried and that the weak and able bodies carry one another. However, this implies that the only people left are the aided, the aided who was assisting others, and the adults in charge. This contradicts the original given scenario, which states that they are all teenagers.\n\n### Refinement of Thinking\n\nTo think more critically, it is best to start by breaking down the problem into logical pieces. To do this, it is useful to identify key words or concepts in the problem that provide useful insights. The concept of \"carry\" is central to this question, indicating that a physical activity involving movement and transportation is taking place. This suggests that a human being is performing the carrying, which narrows the field to able-bodied persons. At this point, it is essential not to overthink the problem, instead take a step back and consider the potential clues within the given choices. Choice A may seem tempting; however, it does not accurately identify only those who can contribute a physical labor. This is because it implies that persons who are \"able\" can perform tasks, which can also include activities such as helping to carry the injured and the ill. Hence, \"weak\" and \"able bodies\" should be combined, eliminating choice B.\n\nChoice C", "answer": " 100"}

If you don't, try working through each step independently and then putting the steps back together.\n\n### Another option to think about as you go along is to subtract first from the left to see if the number ends in a \"4.\" And subtract 4 from the remainder to see how many \"4\"s remain. \n\n### Input:[(-9 - 3) + (2 * 3) - (6 * 5)]. The correct order of operations is to first do all your multiplication and division and then you can do the subtraction. To do this, you want to first do brackets for the numbers that have the operators: \"(\" and \")\", for example, (-9 - 3). You will multiply the first and then divide the first (4 - 3) to get 1. This will change your original problem of (-9 - 3) to ((-9 - 3) * 2). Once you've done this, all you need to do is to divide the remainder by the multiplier, in this case (4). The remainder will be 8 / 4 = 2. Repeat this process but replace (6 * 5). \n\n### After subtracting 3 from the 2nd remainder, you will get 5 remainder.", "answer": " 63"}

For this questions, the question asks us to differentiate the two types of sharks. It has been mentioned that an aquarium, pool hall, Mediterranean sea or a Pacific ocean is a medium for sharks to breed and grow in population. When we read that they \"are likely to be betting\" in a \"pool hall\", we need to understand that this is suggesting sharks are found in pool halls. Furthermore, there is a hint in the question itself that the answer will be \"pool hall.\"\n2. For \"How do you solve the problem?\" questions, reading carefully will help you make a better guess. It is important to consider not only what the question says literally but also how the choices will fit into the context. For example, knowing that a shark is a type of fish implies answers such as \"aquarium\" or \"Mediterranean Sea\" cannot be suitable. As a result, only \"pool hall\" is left.\n3.

There are four possible choices to respond (C) + (A), (B) - (C), (A) - (B), or A + B.\n\n### Input\n\nThe response of an arithmetic operation is the output. The calculation will be performed in a calculator.\n\n### Rationale 1\n\nAs the instruction is an arithmetic question (C) + (B) = R, the calculator shows the possible operations between each variable. \n\nAs the calculator show the possible options for addition and subtraction, we can eliminate the variable that it will not be. To make sure that we will be able to eliminate one variable, we can subtract an equation with the variable we want to use.\n\nSo, if we input `C=88` and `B=18`, the calculator shows `result` $88 + 18 = 106.` However, the calculator does not show possible operations by subtracting a variable from the other variable. Since it shows `result` $106, we can cancel the variable `18` by subtracting equation `A` $18 - 18 = 0` from both of them.\n\n### Calculator input\n\nSo, after subtracting equation $18 - 88 = 70$, we get the result with the only variable $88 + 70 = result` $158.`\n\n### Rationales 2\n\nWe can compare both, `A+C` and `C-B`, for possible operations.

If each can of coke counts as 10.8 cans, how many cans must he refill from the bartender?\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales: First let's find how much each can of coke will be worth: (10.8 X 1.2) = 13.28 ounces of coke = 1.69 x 20 ounces of cope = 34. (1.69 x20) = (36 ounces) Therefore, each can of coke can be considered worth 41.8 ounces.\n\nNow let's figure out how much he'd need to buy to cover the party: ((750 * 0.418)) or 308.5 = 295 (295 is the number of bottles John needs to buy to cover him.)\n\nNow there's a simple solution to this: ((750 - 295) *0.418) or 455. (If John needed to buy more, say 475 bottles, here's how we'd do it: ((475-295) * 0.455) which would come to 475 -295 = 180 * 0.5112 or 90.12 oz.

{"text": "Answer: $27.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question does not ask for the dollar amount, but the number of shillings she paid in taxes.\nThe question does not mention the household taxes, and since Angie is responsible for monthly household expenses, she can only pay one type of tax.\nAngie has a variable salary of $82 and a fixed expense of $48.\nThe remaining $18 can be used to pay for both variable and fixed expenses.\n\nSince $18 is equal to her variable expense ($48-$42-$27 = $18), not taking into consideration the fixed expense, $18 could be used to pay for the variable expense ($18-27 = $0).\nSince it does not state how many shillings were left after the tax payment, it could be that the variable expense was equal to the remaining $18.\n\nIf that was the case, then the variable expense would be $35.\nAfter subtracting the variable expense of $35 from the tax payment of $27, the remaining money is $8, which is equal to Angie's salary of $8.\n\nIn other words, the remaining $18 can pay for the variable expenses.\n\n### Inputs:\nAnswer:\nIn order to answer this question, one must first understand the context provided and the various terms used.

Each room capacity is 4 residents. We can then determine that there are 25 rooms overall.\nFirst, add the total number of apartments, which is 7 apartments.\nNext, divide the total number of rooms by the room capacity to determine the number of residents per room. In this case, we found that each room can accommodate 1.5 residents, on aggregate.\n\nTherefore, if there are 25 total rooms, this means that there are 24 residents per floor of 6 apartments as well as 16 residents per floor of 4 apartments.\nSimilarly, the grand total residents living in the block are 42, which is the correct answer to the given question.\n\nAnswer choice A: 60 would be incorrect because there is a maximum of 4 people in each room, which is 4 per floor. There are 6 floors containing 4 apartments, so we cannot use this figure.\n\nAnswer choice B: 32 would be incorrect because there are 12 total flats, so the grand total of residents would be 60.\n\nAnswer choice C: 48 would be incorrect because again using 60 as the total figure, we found that 25 residents cannot be accommodated in 12 floors because 25 x 12 = 300. That leaves 0 residents, but we've already learned there are 22 residents.\n\nAnswer choice D: 20 would be incorrect because using 25 flats and 1.5 residents/room, we can determine that there are a total of 35 residents for each floor. This is incorrect because we've learned the total number of residents per floor is 24 to 16.\n\nSince Option 5, 42, was not chosen for the above example, but was chosen for the first instruction, consider the pattern of choices chosen in subsequent problems before considering each answer choice.\n\n### Consideration:\nThe answer choices given should generally indicate how many people/residents can be accommodated.

To solve the equation to determine which number Sarah has, we can do that by dividing Tim's number of toad by 2, multiplying Sarah's number of times Jim's number of tods and then subtracting it with Jim's original number. Once you complete the calculation, the number of toads Sarah has would answer your question. We can follow this for Tim and Jim as well. It's possible to work backwards from right to left as well, though it's more tedious.\n\n### Input\n\n 3 5 6\n\nAns 12\n\nSol \n\nRationales - 3x3=15\n- 5x2=10\n- 6x1=6\n\n- 3x1+3x2+4=12\n\n### Input \n\nThe problem is \n\n\n### What are you going to cooking for your mother\u2019s birthday and what type of cake will you serve?\n\nI will bake cake, I will bake ice creams, I will bake pudding and will make a cake\n\n### Demonsration\n- For baking a cake a person will need an oven, knife, sugar, flour, eggs, some baking cups and baking ingredients such as fruits and chocolates\n- For baking ice creams a person will need an ice cream maker, cups and spoons, sugar, milk, vanilla flavour and cold conditions\n- For baking pudding a person will need an over, some baking ingredients like fruits and some baking items including pudding mix and cups\n- For cake a person will require icing for decoration\n### \n##", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "The answer to the question is $328.00.\n\n### Rationale to respond:\n\n1. We need to first make sure that the question asks about the total amount of money that Village Foods makes per month.\n2. The question is asking how much Village Foods earns in monthly sales of lettuce.\n3. We know from the question that Village Foods gets 500 customers each month.\n4. Each of these 500 customers purchases 2 heads for $1 each and four tomatoes from Village Foods for $0.5 each.\n5. Because there are five heads of lettuce sold per customer, and ten tomatoes, $800 worth of lettuce is sold, and $200 worth of tomatoes is sold. Total sales from this scenario is $1000 per month.\n6. Next, we multiply the 500 customers times the amount of lettuce sales per customer, and total sales.\n         $1000 (the total sales) \n         = $10.00(the amount of lettuce sold per person) \n         * 500 people that buy lettuce per month.\n7. $1000 = $5000\n8. We use the multiplication equation to calculate the total number of lettuce sold multiplied by the price of $1 and $0.5 per tomato.\n          $200(the total lettuce sales) \n          * $1(the price per head of lettuce) \n          = 200.\n         $1(the price of each head of lettuce) + 0.5(the price of each tomato) \n          = $100\n9. There is $100 in total vegetable purchases. $100 is the total number of sales each of lettuce and tomato.\n10. Therefore, 1000 dollars of vegetable sales are per month from Village Foods.\n11. The answer is $100.", "answer": " 2000"}

I think we could also write the equation 1 x (number of pairs of shoes) = (number of pairs of the cheap shoes) (the total number of pairs sold) x 0.1 (in this case the discount). Then, we can subtract x 0.1 from each side of the equation, resulting in x (number of pairs sold) = x (number of pairs cheap shoes) - x 0.1. This is because we have 1 discounted pair of shoes for (the total number of pair) x 0.9 or 0.9 = 1 is what I see is the equation 1 x 0.1 = 0.9", "answer": " 12"}

This information proves quite useful for us in solving the question.\n\n5. We first eliminate $100 and this leaves us with 179 dollars, so the answer is, that the bicycle cost 179 dollars.\n\n1. How much was the bikes?\n2. $179.\n\n##### Input: An eagle can eat 12 ounces of food each day. The eagle will eat three ounces more rabbits than pounds of food. If it eats 6 pounds of food, how many pounds of rabbits did the eagle eat?\n\n##### Rationale Answers:\n\n1. We first need to eliminate one variable of these four. We need to eliminate the food from these options and this leaves us just left with the rabbits.\n2. The first step in this question is to eliminate one of the variables from the given options. We could eliminate one from the given options, that is three ounces more pounds of rabbits, since the question has to do with rabbits rather than pounds of food.\n\n3. We note that two pounds of food means 24 ounces of food.", "answer": " 24"}

The 3 dogs from the dog walker that tangled with the others make the other 36 legs, while Mariel's 4 dogs leave 34 legs for her. This means that one of the dog walkers other pups got tangled up in the other dogs' leashes. Since there are 2 dog walkers, one dog walker's pet has 18 legs tangled and the other dog walker's pupper has 18 other pups legs tangled. There is 18 legs per each dog that gets tangled up, for a total of 36 legs tangler.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The answer can be simplified.\n\nThe answer requires the dog walker that has his/her dog tangled has 3 dogs. So the answer for this is 6 legs tangled. This does not effect the other dog walkers dog and therefore, 36-6 dogs =30. This answer was reached by trial and error.\n2. Answer using a diagram.\nOne dog walker has 3 pups, while the other has 2. There is 1 dog walker who has 4 pets which has two pups tangled because there are 36 legs in total. For the other dog walker, the 2 pets have 18 legs tangler for a total of 18 legs tangl in total.

Finally, on Wednesday, Kylie makes one beaded necklace, one brace and five beaded beads, adding up to 30 beads. Total: 350 beads.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nTo figure out total beaded necklaces, braces, and ears, add beaded beads and beaded beads. We start counting necklaces on Monday. Necklaces on Monday and Tuesdya are 20, so we are adding two necklaces for two days. Braces and two beaded bracelets for Tuesday, and seven beaded braces for the day. Beads, which are used to make braces and beads earrings, so we do the total of 3 braces and 7 braids.  Adding 2 + 3= 5. When totaling the beads, add Monday with 200 and Tuesday with 120. Wednesday, it also adds 30 beads, including 5 additions. 300 beads plus 350 beaded beads are a total of 650 beaded beaded beads.\n\nAnswer: 650", "answer": " 325"}
{"text": "The perimeter of a piece of paper is 80 cm longer than the height of a screen if the square paper is 100 cm.\n\n### Response rationale:The perimeter is the total circumference of a shape. The height is the measurement from base to top. It is true that the perimeter of the piece of paper is 10 cm, or 80 cm, longer than the height if the square paper is: 20 cm (A=10 cm, B=20 cm). A=10 cm plus B=20 cm which equals 30 cm (20+10 cm=. 30 cm).\nWhen B=30, and we know C is equal to A+B, then we know: C=40 cm.\nWhen we compare that to the original statement of the problem, we see that the screen is 20 cm, so (20 cm) = C=.40 cm. The original statement of the problem states: the height of the screen is 80 cm shorter than C, so the height of the screen will be 80 cm = A+B -C.\n\nFor example, if the height of the screen was 100 cm and the piece of paper whose perimeter was 100+ 20 (20= the height of the screen) = 120 cm, then the height of the screen would be 100 cm \u2013 (100 cm \u2013 20 cm) = 80 cm.\nAnswer:\nIf A=10 cm, then B=30 cm, then C=40 cm, and we would be left with (40 cm) = A+B, so (40 cm) \u2013 (10 cm) = B.\nThen, we would have 30=A+B, so we would also have 40 cm = 30 cm + B and we would be left wtih 10 cm = 32 cm, so B= (40cm) \u2013 (10cm)= 30 cm, and we'd have B=30cm.\nThen we'd have 30 cm = A+40cm, and we'd be left with A=10 cm \u2013 40 cm = \u2013 30cm.\nAs we can see,", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "$550\n\n### Explanation:The first step is to find Sandi's total bill at the farmer\u2019 market. Her bill is half of her $600. Because she spent $300, her total bill is: $300 + $300 = $600. So Sandi spent $600 at the farmer\u2019.\n\nNext, we have to determine Gillian's spending amount: Gillian spent $125 at the farmer\u2019 markets. In order to find the total spending amount, her spending amount should be multiplied by her total number of farmer\u2019 markets she visited: Gillian's number of trips to the farmer\u2019s markets multiplied by Gillian's sped at each visit is $150 * 3 = 450. \n\nThen, the total amount Gillian spent at the markets is found by subtracting Gillian's total amount from the total amount Sandi spent: $550 = $450 - 300\nAnswer: $550.", "answer": " 1050"}

Using the last equation, we find that they can add: $\\frac {7 + 8}{8} + \\frac{1}{3} = 14$ gallons from this bucket.\n\nSo, $\\frac{7+7}{24}$ gallons are added in total and we have $\\frac{8}{24}$ full buckets. So, there are: 8 trips to fill the first 8 buckets and 1 to fill the remaining $\\frac{8}{8*24}$ gallons.\n![](images/p1.jpg)\n\n### Response 2:The correct response is: 1.53", "answer": " 7"}

Choices: \nA: 0 B: 0 C: 1 D: 2 E: 5 F: none of these\nRationales:  1. The question describes how we can split a number into two equal parts, indicating that there are multiple options.\n2. Among the options we have, we know that A: 0 and E: 5 are no because the number cannot be split equally into two parts.\n\nWe can also eliminate D: 2 as that's not the only way we can split the number into two equal parts.\n3. So, it is left to us between B and C.\n\nTo answer this, we note that 150 = 1 + 4 x (199/2)\n\nSo, one way to split the number into two parts would just be 1 + 79.\n\nTherefore, we can split the number 159 into even two parts in ways 2, giving us both B and C.\n4. This question is asking not what the ways are to split the number, but rather how many ways there might be. \n\nWe can determine this from the information above, and we get that one way to split 150 into two equal parts is with 2, which is D: 2.\n\n5. Therefore, we have 2 + 2 x (1 + 2) / 2, or 10 even ways.\n\n10 + 5 - 5 - 5, which is to say that there are 5 ways the number 158 can be split into two equal halves.  10 + 5 = 15, 5/2 =1.5, so there are 15 of them, in case you were wondering what the 158 was.  It's one of them.", "answer": " 4"}

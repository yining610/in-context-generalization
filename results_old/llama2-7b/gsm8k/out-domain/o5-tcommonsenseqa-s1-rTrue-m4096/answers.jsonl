{"text": "A car started driving through a tunnel with several turns. A turn requires four right-hand turns. To navigate the circuit, you traveled 23 meters after the third turn, and 5 meters after the first turn, and 8 meters after the second turn. The car drives forward at the same speed.\n\n### Explanation:\nTo answer this question, we need to follow certain steps. There are many options and we need to find out which step to consider in order to reach the goal. So to calculate, we need to keep the track of the steps the car has taken.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n* A: The car starts driving in the tunnel\n* B: The car moves for 5 meters\n* C: It takes turns \n* D: The car moves for the final 8 meters\n* E: The car stops\n\nWe could also list these steps in this way:\n* A: 0, 5, 13\n* B: 5, 5, 5 (0+5+5)\n* C: 5, 8, 13 (0+13)\n* D: 0, 3, 5 (0 + 3 + 5)\n\nThe question asks us how far the car was after its third turn.\nWe should first understand the meaning of the word turn here.\n\nA turn is any 360\u00b0 movement. This could be clockwise or anti-clockwise.\n\nThe correct answer is option C: It takes turns.\nOnce you take turns, you can move back to the starting point.\nSo the question to find out the distance is how many turns will return me to the point from which I started after my third turn.\nThe answer to this would be three or 360\u00b0 or 3 left-hand turns. The correct distance would be A.\n\nInput: Which of the following will a person not be doing when they are restoring?

{"text": "Firstly, let's examine the options which are 14 pills, 61 pills, 40 pills, 23 pills and 6 pills. The options with the largest number of pills are 14 pilla and 61 pills. However the cost for the pills is calculated by 14 pils * $ 1.50 + 14 pils + $5.50 + 6 pills * $ 5.50. So, Henry took 14 pills a day for $1.50 a pill. Now, we must multiply the cost of the pills with that how many pills Henry took a day. The sum of the total cost should be $ 93.50. But Henry took 14 * $ 1.00 + 14 * $5.50 = $93.50 and 14 * $1.50 +14 * $5,50 + 6 * $5,5 = $93.00. So we have to calculate the fraction with 135, so 135 / $5.5 = 24 pills.

Above ground evaporation. 2. Solar evaporation. \n### Input: How does lightning occur? \n\n### 1. When thunderstorms occur, lightning often follows. Thunderstorms are often caused by warm, moist air colliding with drier, colder air. The warm, humid air rises, and the colder air replaces it. When the warm and the cold meet, convection cells begin to form, and the convection cells rise into the atmosphere, where they meet into a thunderstorm. As more and more cells build at the thunderstorm's base, clouds form, blocking out all light. When a lightning bolt strikes, that lighting discharge is likely to release enough energy to start another thunderstorm.\n\n### 2. A lightning bolt is not a bolt of light, but a bolt of electricity. A lightning bould is caused by a separation of positive and negative electrical charges located far apart in a circuit. The negative point attracts the positive point and so creates a stream of electricity. The negative point is in the Earth, where there are many positive charges.

{"text": "The answer is 3240\n\n### Demostration\nThe first step of the thought process is to state what is given. The question firstly states that there are 5 ancient scrolls in the library cabinet.\n\nThe next part of the question is that each one is older than the previous one by half the age of the previous one. From here, we see that we need to write down the first 4 scrolls to find the age for the next one. Let us call this scroll A and start counting from A. That means this scroll's age is 1.\n\nThe next scroll is B. B is 10 years older than the previous scroll (A), so scroll B is 11 (10+1).\n\nAnd so we continue, scroll C is 20 years older than the last scroll, so scroll C is 31. \n\nThe next scroll, scroll D, is 40 years old (29+11+1).\n\nFinally, scroll E is 50 years old (39+11+2).\n\nSo scroll E, 50 years old, is the fifth scroll.

For each question, pick the best answer.\n\n### Student 1: What does it mean to use the pronoun 'that' correctly?\n\n[Student 1]: The pronoun that refers to the noun that directly precedes it or to one of its closest modifiers. It cannot be used by itself nor can you replace it in a sentence.\n\n### Input Student 2\nWhat is the difference between 'it's' and 'its'?\n\n[Student2]: You often see the misuse of the word 'it's', which is commonly mistaken for possessive. It's, also known as the contraction, is composed of the words it and is, indicating that something is being conveyed or understood. However, the word 'it' does not indicate that its is its for possessive purposes. One can use the word 'its' with a similar meaning, where the word 'its' replaces the word 'it' when the latter can become troublesome.\n\n###  Input Student 3\nWhat is dangling modifier?\n\n[Student3]: A dangling modifier appears when a word's meaning becomes unclear and the sentence cannot be understood on a logical basis. One can see the example of \"Because of their long journey, the traveler had forgotten to grab a lunch to eat along the way.\"\n\n### Students 4: \nWhat is run on sentence?\n\n[Studen4]: A run-on sentence occurs when you join independent clauses without any conjunction, such as \"When I saw the lizard, it was jumping from tree to tree,\" and becomes confusing to read.

Hence, the total number of pages left equals the number of pages in the final book multiplied by 4. The last book contains the same number of pages as the first few (200 \u00d7 2 = 400 pages). Therefore, the last book should have 200 \u00d7 4 = 800 pages. 5. So the total number of pages read till the end of the series is 2,808 + 800 = 3,608.\n5. Therefore, the total number of remaining pages (14*200 \u2013 3,602) = 2,352 left to read. \n\n### Inputs: A. What number is both a two digit and four-digit number?

The digits 2 and 4 are the number 44/80. The number 4 contains the digits of 44 and 80 can be divided by 2. Therefore, 24=2*4=2*4*4=16=2*8=2*8*8=2^3*3^3= 24. Therefore, 2 and 4 belong to 13.

{"text": "The correct answer is A: 321.\n\n### Solution:First, list the total number of vehicles (cars and motorcycles combined) for sale in the lot, which is 24.\n\nNext, determine the proportion of vehicles that are motorcycles and the proportion of vehicles that include a spare tire. Note from the question that a third of the vehicles are for motorcycles, and then a quarter of vehicles have a spare tire.\n\nBy combining the above two ratios, we are able to use the cross-multiplication method, where each answer factor is multiplied by the other to find the answer. Therefore, for the vehicles that include a spare tyre, we have:\n\nTotal number of vehicles including a spare tyre * Total number of vehicles with a spare tyre / Total number of vehicles with or without a spare tyre = 86 * 24/ (24+86) = 556\n\nHence, the proportion of vehicles including a spare tire is:\n\n556/392 = 1.41775878\n\nSimilarly, for the amount of vehicles that are motorcycle, we also apply the cross-multiplication formula:\n\nTotal number motorcycles * Total number motorcycles / Total number vehicles = 86 *86/ (86+24) = 646\n\nThus, the proportion of the vehicles for motorcycles is: 646/24 = 27.3798\n\nNow, in the question, the first part states that of the vehicles in total:\n\n\"A third of the vehicles are, or a total of, motorcycles. This is the proportion of motorcycles: 27.38019\"\n\nWhile the second part states that of the cars in total:\n\nA quarter of the cars have, or a total of:\n\n\"a spare tire included. This the proportion of cars: 24/4 = 6\"\n\nSo, to find the overall answer for the vehicles on the lot, we can set these two proportions equal to each other:\n\n3.47 + 4 = 7.50, which is equivalent to 27.4999999\n\nHence", "answer": " 84"}

{"text": "Punger needs to buy 320 (60 x 10) special pages to store the cards he bought.\n### Rationale:The solution to this problem is to determine the required pages based on the number of cards Punger bought. We can see from the facts provided that he bought 60 packs containing 7 cards each and wants to store these cards in 10 pages.\nThe key to solving this problem is to first determine the total number of cards in a pack and then how many packs he bought. In this way, we can see that there are 420 (60X7= 420) total cards in a pack and he buys 56 packs, meaning there are 4910 (420X10) cards in total.\nOnce we know the total number of cards we bought, it's easy to determine the necessary number of pages - we just need to divide the number of cards by the pages (10) to get the number of pages. In this case, we have 4910 cards/10 pages = 491.

The amount of liquid required to dissolve the ingredients(1/2 cup) is 1/2 cup water, thus adding the 2 ingredients and measuring the amount of liquid we've  got will give the answer.\n\nThe amount of liquid needed is 1/2 which is 2 cups(1/2+1/2=2)(150ml/cup=200ml)\n\nWe can then add the dry ingredients and measure the amount of liquid.\n\nSo 2+1+3+1/2=4", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "Stu's books are 16 (9 + 7 + 1 + 9 - 1 = 16).\n\n### Input/Demo:\nStuart has 9 books and his brother Albert has 4 times more books than Stu. So, Stuart and Albert have 52 and 200 books.\n\n### Input and Demo: A: When I call you, what are you most likely going to be doing? B: Reading C: Talking D: Doing homework E: Talking on phone\nRationales: The statement \u201cWhat are you most likely to be doing when I call you?\u201d implies the option that relates to a person\u2019s activities before the call. \n1. The options are - Reading, Talking, Doing homework, or Talking on phone.\n2. In this context, it is unlikely that a person would be reading when they are expecting a call from you or they will be doing homework immediately before the call. 3. While Talking could be a possible answer option, it is unlikely to be true as, in most conversations, both parties are speaking. \n4. Therefore, we must consider whether the person has called someone else, which would mean they were previously talking. \n5. Taking this point into consideration along with the fact that a call could be made without talking, we can eliminate the answer option C and D since they do not apply to the statement that a person will be doing homework.\n6. Finally, the person could be talking on the phone when the call comes from you. \n7. Therefore, it seems most likely that \u201cWhen I call you, what will you most likely be doing?\u201d refers to a person talking on the phone. \n8.

So, 24-20(four + two) is what we get by subtracting the price from the total. Now, the cost of the stuff animal is just one of the unknowns. So, divide both sides of the equation by the unknown, which in this case is one, and we get 2/1 = 4 (solving for the stuff animal)\n\nSo, the stuff animal costs $5.", "answer": " 11"}
{"text": "In this task, we need to find the answer from given statements. Firstly, answer the second half question. Secondly, answer the first half question. Finally, find the average.\n\n#### Response:Answer the second half question first by using given data.\n\nThe race lasted for 30 minutes. We need half and double of 30 minutes to find the first half. So, its 10 minutes.\n\nThe race was completed in 30 minutes and he made a time of 20 minutes at the second half. So, the difference in time (first half and second half) is 20-10 = 10 (minutes). Therefore, he took 10 minutes in first half and 10 at the second half.\n\n10/72 - 10 = 1/72 = 31 seconds. This is the first half\u2019s average speed.\n\nThen answer the first half question before answering the average.\n\nThe first half took 10 minutes. Average of the first half is 31 seconds.(10 minutes/31 seconds = 0.64 mins)\nBecause, the first half took 1/3. In the second half, we took 1/2. First half's average speed 0.64 and the second half's average speed is 1/2. \n\nTo complete answer the first half, multiply first half average with second half average.\nAverage of the first half = (0.64 m) * (1/2) = 0.128 m/s\n\nNow, we have the answer to the first half question. So, we can start to answer the average.\n\nTo find the average speed from the answer of the first half, we need to add both these values (0.128/31 first half avg & 1/2 of avg of second half).\n\nSo, (0.12 + 0.5) *2/10 = 0.27.\n\n0.256 m/s (the answer to the average question).\n\n### In some languages, like English, the words 'runs', 'browses','reads', 'drives' and 'travels' are spelled with the same first", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "John gets $7200 a year to rent his apartment!\n\n### Rationales: Let's start with the givens: John gets $1080 by renting his apartment, the apartment is worth $900 per month and he gets it sublets to three people, whose rent are $400 per person per month. 1. Let's start by eliminating the things he spends on: John does not use this money to pay his bills (because he doesn't have any).  So, we get zeroes for that. (13)  He does not use it for other purposes because he doesn't have such other purposes. (15)  So, what is the profit?  He made enough rent to rent the apartment all by himself or he made a profit of $2800 a year for his 900 rent. 2. Now, let's do what he spent.  900 is 3 times 300. $900 is his rent and John spends $300 in maintenance.  18.71 is 27 times 6.78. (So, this is how much his 3 tenants each pay, minus what he receives.) 27 is 3 times 9.  John also has to pay taxes which is $117.40 (he is left with $18.71). 122 is his net income. Since there are 12 months in a year, 122 is a monthly average.  $145.17 is 900 times 1.55 (John made $155 more than the original rent price of $900.)  $191.26 is 3 times 64.35.  That was the rent money John's three tenants paid him.  4. That leaves $190.17 for John. $190.24 is John's income - he spent $0. 2.  If we add the $145.22 for the rent back then they're even. 5.

Choices: 1. A: done quickly 2. B: done cheaply 3. C: done poorly 4. D: done well 5. E: done properly\nRationales: The question is: What do we mean when something's called efficient or productive?, and a choice is asked to be selected. \nFirst, understand the meaning of this sentence. When we say that something is called efficient or produtive, what it actually means is 'What we mean when we say what is done quickly with low cost and good quality'. Thus, we have the following: when we say something is efficient, it's the same as saying that what is done quicky, which is choice 1. When we say something is productive, it's the opposite of 1. If it's efficient, it's done quickly, and when we say it's productive, its the opposite, that it's done slowly. \nSo, we have the following table:\n\n- If we say what is efficient and productive is done with good speed, this can possibly be interpreted as being done fast. The problem is that fast!= quicky. Quick means exactly the opposite of slow. There's a difference between slow and fast. But being fast doesn't have anything to do with it. So what if we say what is called productive and efficient is not done quickly. We're just being fast, not productive or efficient?\n- So here, a question is: 'When we say that something that is done quickly is called productive, is that efficient or not?' and the choices given are to choose between what is doing fast, what is efficient and productivity.\n- If someone had to choose between what is efficiently done and what is done fast, they will probably", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "Answer the question. \n\nInput: Which of the following is a valid option for identifying a specific object?  Choices:  A) its name B) its type C) its shape D) its purpose E) its color\nRationales:\n1. There are some types of objects which only have one type of identifier, like their name. \n2. Other object categories which may have more than one identifier would be their type, the object's shape, and so on. \n3. But, colors cannot be used to uniquely identify an object because colors are shared by many objects. For example, many cars are blue. \n4. Therefore, A is not a valid option.\n5. Another example would be glass. \n6. Since there are many types of glass, glass can't accurately be identified by its type. \n7. Next, you can eliminate B, which stands for an object's type. \n8. There are many shapes of objects, for example, many circles have round shapes. \n9. Also, just like the case of type, a circle isn't sufficient as many different objects can have similar shapes. \n10. Lastly, for D, when an object has a special function or purpose, it can help identify the object. \n11. For example, a stapler helps staple papers. So, a stapler and a pair of scissors would not be the same.\n12. However, a stapler can't be used as its function alone to identify an object because two or more objects can have the same function, such as a stapler and scissors. \n13.

By spelling badly, I mean that I intentionally write incorrectly, like how you did with the \"shoots\" word. This is because I believe that we can use informal words and still be effective at conveying our message.\n3. I am writing the sentences in the most precise way available to me, but I am using informal words.\n4. Also, I believe that by writing informally, it will make it easier for an individual who may not be fluent in writing to understand what I am saying.\n5. Your question made me reflect on the way that I write, and I have decided that there is no harm in writing informally.\n6. In addition, formal writing is more time-consuming and it may not be possible for me to write in a more formal way. \n7. This is because my primary goal is to communicate effectively with others, and I have decided to accept the challenges that come with writing informally.\n8. There is also a chance that even if I wrote formally, it could still be challenging for others to understand what I am trying to say.\n9. Writing formally does not always guarantee that my message will be clearly understood, but informal writing does not mean that I do not care about proper writing.\n10. I believe that the way I communicate is more important than being a good formal writer. \n\n### Inputs:\n\n\"How does a person determine if an apple contains too many worms or not?\"\n\"How does one decide if an apple is good or not?\"\n\"I like to buy my", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "12\n\n### Rationales:\nJar A contains 28 marbles, and jar B has 12 marbles more than jar A, so we know that it has 40 marbles in total.\n\nFrom jar B, we can take away 12 marbles and place them in jar C. Now, jar C has 28 marbels less than jar B (four times more than it has marbles), and a total of 12 more left in jar A.\n\nNow we are back to jar A and jar B. Jar B is left with 12 marbles fewer than it had before taking any marble away from jar A. The total of marbles in jar B must, therefore, equal 28 + 12 = 40.\n\nFrom jar A, we can now take away 12 and place them in jar B. Both jar A and jar B are now empty, and jar C will have twice as many marbles than jar B, or 40 marbles.\n\nThis means that we can take 28 marbles out of jar A and replace them with 12 marble and there\u2019s still an equal amount in jar A in total.\n\nHope this solves your problem!", "answer": " 148"}

{"text": "The answer is B- The answer is 30%.\n\n### Explanation:We need to set up an equation to solve this question. So, let's start with what the question is asking, which is that John gets a bonus that'll be the same percentage every year, last year he made 100K and got a bonus of 10K and this year he's making 200K. This means 100/200 x100. So for this example, it'll be 100/y xy and then 10000 will be xy, 10k will be x, and y is the amount he is making this year which is 200K/100/100K. So, y is 20K. And y*10k, that's the bonus he has already because y*10K. That equals 200K, because he's already gotten a bonus of 110K. So now, we have y*10,001 and we're adding it up with the amount he's making this year, what he makes is 200,010. And our answer is 200/1010, 200*1010 is 206,200 and then our answer is 2670 which is 30% of 200000. The answer is 206200-20000.", "answer": " 220000"}

Since we are multiplying 3:1, the equation would be (3x1)x(1x1) = 3.\n\nIf the votes for the dragon's cake was 2 times more votes than the witches cakes votes, then it would have to be in a proportion of 8:2 = 4:1.\n\nIf the number if people who voted for the witch's cake was seven 7, the votes needed to cast would be (3x3)+(8x7) = 51. 25 more than 7, so the total number of votes cast would be 72.

Why? Choices: 1: There are a lot of ways to calculate this, this is the most intuitive and logical given the information is presented. 2: 30 is half of 60, so there are 60 more cows than 30 less cows. Thus, there are 30 bulls. Since 20 is half of 30, there are 10 more bulls on the farm. Since there are 10 additional bulls, subtracting them from the total cows (30) will leave 20, leaving 70 cows total. 3: The answer is (30+10) - 20 = 70 \n\n### Demostraton:\nInput 20 more cws\nRationales for choice 1\nAnswer 2 is correct because there is no wrong answer.

We will set up an equation that accounts for the amount of money by each one and then divide the equation by three to get the answer.\n\nThe answer can be easily reached using this equation: $100 = Ian's $100 + Ian's 3 * $35 = $45.33 more than he has at the start.

Now, because typing document with 985 words will take him more than 1 hour, we can deduce that Mike can type 985 words / 30 words per minute (Mike's maximum typing speed) = 33 minutes\n\n### Scoring Feedback:Corporate, but not professional: You had an appropriate response.

{"text": "Let's consider the possibilities first. It is clear that our number must be a multiple of 1,20,00. We know that the city's bus system carries around 1,20.00 people each day, so our multipler will have to be at least 1,20 to accommodate the bus system's daily riders. Now, all we need to figure out is how to combine all the multiples of 120. This can be done in a number of ways, but we'll choose to take 1200 as 120 x 10. To find the average daily riders, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of riders in each of those weeks. 120 is a multiple of 1200, so it is a part of that range. We know that the bus system carries around $1,200.000 riders each day. So, all we need to find is the number of weeks. This can be calculated as: $$N=1200$$ weeks for 13 weeks. To find all the multiages of 120, we can use the formula $\\frac{n}{120}$, where $\\frac{n}{n}$ gives 1. This means to calculate all multiples of 10. Now, the number of riders is multiplied by this number to find the total weekly amount of people carried by the bus system. The answer is in 12.24 years.

First, we must understand the question that asks about the percentage of the collection that has been donated to the hospital after the total is increased by $100.\n2. The information given in the question is that The amount of money that has already been collected is $125. To get the final contribution, we could add $100. This is because the contribution increases by $100, or 10000/125 = 80, and this means $100. \n3. Now, we can ask ourselves, \"Why exactly is it that $100 is donated?\" In this case, it is because 25% or $25 of the new contribution is donated to the children's hospital.\n4. Therefore, we should be looking for the contributions that are donated to the hospital specifically.\n5. Thus, the part that donates the funds to the hospital is actually not part of the new total, which means that the new total that is dedicated to the hospital is actually $175, not $235.\n6.

The question asks how long it would take Grace to finish reading a 40-page book at her constant rate.\n2. A book's length is typically represented by its number of pages. \n3. So, we can take any number of pages and multiply it by her 10 pages per 1 hour rate to find how long it will take. \n4. Since her constant rate is 1, the number of pages of a book corresponds to the amount of time it would take to read that book.\n5. Substituting a book length of 200 into the formula =20x20, the number of hours it would take Grace to read the 200- page book is 400.\n6. Then, since the book length of 250 is 20 more pages than before, we can increase Grace's constant rate by 20 hours, which is 0.50, to 10.5, and substitute it back into the formula, resulting in the answer of 50. \n7.

{"text": "$85\n\n### Input and Choices:  \nBrian and Clyde's car is $96. If Brian borrows $10 from Clyde, what portion of the car is Brian's? Choices: 1: A: 12%; B: 15%; C: 25%; D: 88%\n\n### Rationale \n1. We start at the second sentence where it says that Brian borrows $1 from Clyde. This means that Brian does not own the remaining amount as he borrowed some of the car.\n2. Since Brian did borrow $10, it would make $96 - $10 = $86.\n3. Brian owns a percentage of the car that would be equivalent to $86 / $96 * 100% = 88% of the car.\n4. Thus, the answer is D. Brian owns 88% of their car.\n\n### Inputs and Questions: \n\"The _______ are just beginning to sprout their bright flowers?\"(question) Choices: A: trees B: plants C: mountainsides D: tulips E: oak\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question mentions \"the tulips are just beginning to sprouts their bright flowers\". This implies that \"the tulips\" are the subject that is being described in the sentence. \n2. The options A to D are nouns as they are either plants, mountains, trees, and oak. This narrows the choice options down to words that describe the bright flowers and not other plants. \n3. We can rule out C and E as their description doesn't necessarily depict the bright flowers. Thus, the answer must be D: tulips.\n\n### CAP Questions:\nInput: I don't have anyone to __________ with.\nChoices:\nA: get some\nB: spend time with\nC: do anything with\nD: speak to\n\n### Rationals:\n1.

By subtracting 26 more apples from 53 (that is, 53 - 26 = 27), Carla ended up with only 8 apples.\n\nB: To determine how many apples Buffy stole, we must first calculate how many apples were left by Carla, which is 8 (80 \u2013 69 = 11, and 11 \u2013 27 = 8). Because Buffy stole 26 more appels than the amount remaining by Carla (69 \u2013 26 = 43), she stole a total of 69 apples from Carla.\n\nC: This is a different kind of problem that doesn\u2019t fit the pattern as the questions aren\u2019t directly related to the story which means you need to choose a number that makes the most sense. 133 seems like the most likely choice because it\u2019s the only number that is not mentioned in the story.\n\nD: This is a different problem that follows the pattern but is not directly related to the story.

{"text": "40 min (80 sec)\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer: We need to first figure out the time it takes to fill a 1 liter tub. We now that the cap at the bottom allows the tube to not hold all of the water that runs through. The water can leak out of the tub. We also know that the water is running at a rate of 12 liters/min. We also know that 12/minute x 1 hour = 12. We know that 12 seconds = 1 minute. 12 x 60 = 720 seconds. 720 seconds is the amount of time it takes to fill 1 liter. For 120 liters, we need to multiply this number by 120, which is 8,640.\n\nThe water supply opens for 1 minutes and closes for 1 minutes. That takes the water in the tub to 40%. But, we do know the cap at the bottom does leak water out. For the next few minutes, we need to keep in mind that we loose 1 liter of water every minute. We need to multiply 1 liter by all the minutes. So we need to multiply 1 by the the times the water opens. (1 X 7 = 7) We also will need to multiply 1 x the times the water closes.(1 X 8 = 8)\n\nThe water runs off and does not fill the tub, until we leave it open for 1 minute again. So for the first 9 minutes, we only have enough water to fill around 90 liters.\n\nSo for the first 9- minutes, we can only fill the tub to around 90% of the size of the tub. So after an hour or so has passed and we are still not to the 100%, we can fill the tub. \n\nSo the water supply opens the first 9-minutes, for 28 seconds. For the next 8 minutes, it\u2019s closed. So for the first hour, it is only open for 28 x 180 = 4.32 seconds. The next time it opens, we have only 9.32 seconds.

{"text": "The correct response is 8000. The calculation goes as follows: In one egg sac, there are 1000 baby tarantulas and the answer will be the multiplication of the number of legs each tarantula will have and the number of egg sacs. Each tarantula will have 8 legs, meaning that there is 800 legs per egg sac, and in 1 less than 5, there are 4 egg sacs, meaning that there are 4 x 800 = 3200 legs total. Since the question asks us to find the amount of baby tarantula legs in one less than 4 egg sacs. 4/4 - 1 = 0 - which means that there are 2333 legs per egg sac. There are a total of 2333/5 of 5 egg sacs, which equals to the answer of 4666 Legs. Subtracting the amount of legs per egg sac from the total means that 8000 legs will be left, meaning 8000 leaves the correct answer, which is 800.\n\n### Input I received: If a tarantula has 8 legs, and one taratnuala can contain 10 tarantulas,\nHow many legs would be found in _two-thirds_ of an egg sac?\n\n### Answer I gave: If a tarantulas can contain _666_ legs,\nHow many baby tarantulas would be _less than_ 10?\n\n### Explanation for mistake:\n\nI accidentally copied a few letters in my answer and got the number wrong.\n\n### Excuse: I answered this question quickly and I had two wrong responses because of my time limitations.", "answer": " 32000"}

The length and width of a 9-by x 13-inch cakes pan are 9 inches and 13 inches, respectively, making the total surface area of 107 square inches. If the total weight of cake ingredients, including sugar, flour, and any other food additives, is 1.3 pounds, what is the exact weight of sugar added to the cake ingredient?\n\n### Demostration:\n1. Using the length and width of the pan and the total surface available, you can find the area of the pan by using the formula S=L*W=9*13=117 square inches.\n2. Knowing the exact weight of ingredients and the given S, you can determine a proportion: 1.3 / 117 = ___________.\n\n3. The amount of sugar that the cake recipe requires is a unit of weight as there are different units of weight to measure ingredients such as tablespoons, ounces, pounds, and kilograms.\n\n4. Therefore, divide the given proportion by the unit of weight in the problem: 1.3/L = ____________.\n\n5. The final step is to substitute the variable value L into the given equation, which gives the weight of sugar in ounces: 1.3 divided by 9.\n\n6.

The zoo has only panda couple of same gender and mating only with other couples. How many panda babes born in a year?\n\n### Solution:\nLet the total number of pandas be the total of all the mating couples as A, B, C,..., M, with each mating couple having a separate probability.\n\nThere are 25% chances that each mating couple would become pregnant. So  if n (number of pandas) = {(25%)^C} (C can be any power of 25%) and so 25% = (25%)^1. So 25% = [(25%)^C]% = (25%)C (Since each term is in terms of C).\n\n\nNow consider each coupling as Pair x,y.\n\nSo 25% = P(x,y) = probability of couple x, y becoming pregnant.\n\nSo probability of couple x,y becoming pregnant can be given as P(x,y)=P(x)+P(y), \n\nwhere 1st is sum P(x)+P(x) where P(x) is probability of any mating pair of couples of x.\n\nIn this case, there are 5 pairs of couples, So \n25% = 5 * (P(x)+P) + P(x),\nBut 25% = 25%, so 5*(P(x)+P)+P= 5 which is impossible, so \n\n5*P+P=25(5(P) +P =25)\nSo P+3=5 so from P=5-3=2/5 so P=2/5.\nSo Probability P(x)+P=2/5 of coupling becoming pregnant in some year is 2/5", "answer": " 2"}

Choices: A: $10.00 B: -25 C: 25 D: -45 E: $70.00 \nRationales:1. The question is, at the 25th school day, what is John's net gain.\n2. First, I understand the question - When the time is recorded from 0 to 1 day, that is 23 cents. When the time is recorded to 14 days, his lunch would also become 14 dollars. The question refers to the 25 days.\n3. Thus, the question is what is John's gain for the 25 days as of the 25th days.\n4. The question has a choice for answer letter C, which is incorrect.\n5. The lunch for each day is expensive as the question states the cost to be 75 cents.\n6. Hence, the cost of the lunch would be more expensive each day, meaning if we choose A or B, the lunch would be expensive as well, which is incorrect. \n7. Then, reviewing the choices, the most correct one should include the amount of money John lost as his lunch.\n8.

{"text": "There is a question of what volume of air is needed to fill the balloons initially, since the gas tanks do not seem to hold enough. But, the quantity of gas needed to fill the 1000 10-liter balloons is 10000 liters or about 29 gallons.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. First, we need to find the amount of gas needed to fill each of the 100 10 liter balloons. Each balloon holds about one liter of water. \nSince the weight of air equal the weight of water according to the Archimedes' principle, the volume will be roughly 10 liters\nThen, we multiply it by 1000 to get the quantity of gas needed, which equals about 1000 liters.\n2. Once we find how much gas is required, we do not know how long each balloon is inflated. We do not know how long a balloon will stay inflated. It will depend on the amount of air used to inflate the balloon.\n3. Consider the following information: \nSuppose each gas tank is 10 gallons. \nThen, the first tank could fill up 500 balloons and then could fill up 29 gallons, which is enough to fill 50 balloons.\n4. To know if the tank will not hold enough gas to inflate the baloon, look at the number of gallons in the gas tank. Divide by 50, the number of balloons each gas tank fills. \nThe first tank will fill 37 balloons without using any of the gas. \nBut it holds 10 gallons which is enough to fill only 19 of the 10-gallon balloons. Therefore, the tank is only full for 19 of the balloons.\n5. However, this does not seem to be the case as there are just 1000 tanks instead of 29 required gas tanks to fill the 1500 balloon.\n\n6.

The question asked in the input for the words \"Synonyms for \"cured\" are A: sad, B: blessed, C: happy, D: angry, E: cursed, F: unhappy\"\n\n2. First, you need to understand \"Synonyms\". A synonym is another word or phrase with the same-or nearly the same-meaning as a specific word or phrase in the English language.\n\n3. You also need to understand that for this kind of work, \"answer this question\", it's expected to be a free response (no formulae, no short answer).\n\n4. So, to approach the problem, you first need to understand what a synonym is. There are two words from the options that may be synonyms because they both mean blessed (B or C). This means they also have a third meaning which means happy (H)\n\n5. We can then look at the synonym B. If the answer is a synonym from option B, it cannot be a synonym for C, which means one of them from option B is the answer. So if one is happy, the other is sad (option F to be happy means to be sad. This is another type of synonyms that is called a \"antonym\".)\n\n6. If Option B is the answer, the answer options then all have a third meaning which is (to be) sad.

So as to not starve, what can we assume about the two animals?\n\n### Demostration: Let T be the time in days until the lion and wolf are starved. From the given information, we can create the equation T = 1/2A where A is the number of animals the lion/wolf eat. Because the lion/wold can not eat both, it can eat only one and the rest needs to be discard, there is no need to account for this as it is not a necessary variable for the given information.\n\n### Response  Since both the lion and the wolf can only eat one animal at once, it can also be expressed by stating that \"A + 1 = (1/2)T\" where A is animals the lion/the wold eats per day. And, since the time has to pass by until both animals starve, it can be shown by stating that (1/2)A = T. The only way for us to find out the number of animals the two can eat is to solve the equation and obtain the value for A. A + 1 = ( 1 / 2 ) T So, (1/2) T = A + 1\n\n(1/2) T - T = A + 2\n\n1/2 - T = A - 1\n\nT = 4A - 5\n\nT = 3A\n\nTime = 3/2 days\n\nThe wolf and the lion are on their 3 days, they still survive because they can eat more than one type of animals but for so long, they will not be able to support themselves with the limited capacity", "answer": " 7"}

Start off with what you have, (30 oranges) then split it in two halves, (15). You have two group and two halves you start with two times four which is 8. (8 oranges x2 = 16 or so). You now have to count what you have left, so just to be safe I will leave half for Terries mom since she is sharing with her mother.

The choice here is a bit of a trick question as it is likely that you will arrive at work earlier than that, so it seems more appropriate to say \"work a little earlier\" rather than \"work exactly earlier\" C: go the office earlier - This also is a bit of a tricker. The intention is to do your work slightly earlier, but in this case it feels more appropriate to say you work exactly earlier D: do the job earlier - It also suggests that you're doing your job exactly earlier, so the answer choice here seems to be similar to \"work exactly earlier\" E: finish a little earlier - Similarly to the other choices, this seems to indicate that you're starting your work exactly earlier, so the choice here seems to be \"earlier\" and not \"exactly earlier\"\nAnswer to student 2: E: finish a little early\n\n### Input the following:\n\n### You bought some pencils, 4 pens and 3 erasers.

{"text": "In a two-week period, the fishmongers sold eighty kg of fish, as the following:\n1. Salmon: 50 kg.\n2. Fish: 30 kg.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. First, review the question. The question is asking how many fish the fishmonger eventually sold in two weeks. In this situation, the fishmongered sold a certain amount of fish each week. The first week, the fishmongoer sold 50kg of fish. In the second week, he tripled that, or 30kg. The question asks how much fish was sold in those two weeks.\n2. We then review the choices given. There's a few issues with the choices: \n3. B: fish - 30 kg is not correct. As we know, fish is a common item and we can easily find it at supermarkets. In this case, this choice of this answer seems wrong.\n4. C: 300 - the question didn't ask about the amount of fish sold in a two-week period but a single two-week period. As a result, this answer is not a valid choice.\n5. D: 60 kg - by increasing the amount of fish in the second week over three times the first, we get this amount.\n6. A: 80 kg - we can subtract 50 from 300 to get 250kg, then divide it by two to get 125kg. This means it's tripled. As a result, 80 kg is the correct answer.\n\n### Input The bird was looking for a nice spot to nest. It finally settled high up into what?

Hence, Joel\u2019s garden will be used for 6-16 square foot for strawberries = 6 square feet.\n### Example:Answer the questions as stated or to the best of your ability.

How many instruments other than the guitar can he take on the open air park?\nThe answer is A.) 0\nIn order to put any other instruments on his trampoline, Joel\u2019s trampoline have enough size to put two instruments. Joel is trying take his guitar. Therefore, according to the statement, \u201che has to pack his guitar\u201d his trampoline does not have enough space to put instruments other than his guitar.\n\n### Example 2: \nJack is looking for a pet that is quiet and gentle.

If Jack chooses any animal he may not keep that animal.\n\nThe answer is B.: a bunny\nIn this task, I can get some data about the problem in the statement. I can make some conclusion with my data. There are 5 choices that cannot satisfy Jack\u2019s request of finding a quiet and gentle pet. The only two animals left that is acceptable is a dog and a bunny. I can also infer that dogs and bunnies are the only suitable animals. I can know that Jack is more likely to choose a dog rather than a bunny because Jack said he wants the pet to \u201cstay still and", "answer": " 8"}

Since Kevin managed to eat 64 wings in 8 m, Alan needs to eat 16 more than 64 to beat Kevin's (i.e. a total of 70) hot wings.\n2.

After all, sometimes students have the answer, but not the math skills to explain it, and sometimes students completely misunderstand the problem and don't have an answer. If they have no answer, you should make clarifying questions. There are numerous techniques to understand and get a student to think about the problem they may have, and I suggest you see if they understand what is being asked, and if they do, what is missing from their answer. \n\nYou could even put in some of the techniques I described at the beginning, such as describing a technique, and then asking a question which uses the technique. For example, you could say:\n\n\"For the division step you can use \"divide by 2\" or \"cut in half\". Use your best judgement. For example, you can divide by 2 and get 5, or 60 divided by 2 is 30. Which one is easier to say, or easier for you to understand?\"  This shows them techniques are being applied.\n\nAfter you have given them information, but they are struggling, you could ask them to summarize what you explained with your own words.

How much change does she have? Choices: 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents A: Sarah is in the third grade, which is three grader. She has 9 and a quarter change, or 9.25 cents.\nRationales:\n1. Review the question thoroughly and focus on the key information - Sarah is in the third Grade and needs $12. This means that she doesn't have enough money and needs to add 3 cents to get her money to $12.\n2. Now it gives us the options that Sarah can do in order to help her get her money to $ 12. We have to make a change of $12 in this situation. We can do multiple choices to do this. One option is to put a nickel. This will be an option from one hundred cents. Another option is to put 50 cents. This option is from two hundred cents to three hundred cents which is enough to make a total of $ 60 which is 12/3 of three hundred cents. Another choice we have is to put 25 cents after putting 10 cents. This gives us a total of $ 26 which is 12% of 25 cents. Finally, choosing a 10 cent gives us a total of thirty-two dollars, or 12% of ten cents, and gives us a total of 32 dollars.\n3. Now that one can understand the question, review the given choices. 50 cents: 50 cent is 2*50, it's 5 dollars and 50 cents more. This does not include the amount needed for change.

{"text": "Solving this problem requires three steps: 1. Counting the blowfish, 2. Counting the clownfish, and 3. Counting the total now.\n\n### Step 1: Counting the blowfish\n\nThere are initially 36 blowfish and 26 of these are staying in their own tank. The remaining blowfish swim in the display tank. So, there are now 26+2 blowfish swimming in the display tank. Therefore, 26+2 is equal to 36, thus the number of blowfish swimming in display tank is 36.\n\n###  Step 2: Counting the clowns\n\nIn the display tank there are initially 26 blowfish and as many clownfish. There are then three clownfish that swim back into their tank. This means that initially 26+2 clownfish are swimming in the display. Now, the number of clown is reduced by 3, so 26+2-3 = 24 is now swimming in the display, but then further 2 clownfish swimming into display tank, total count is now 24+2 = 26, thus the number clowns swimming in display tank will be 26 (14:09).\n\n### Step3: Counting the total number\n\nThere are initially two aquariums: the main tank and the other side tank. In the main tank, there are initially 24 clownfish. So, 24 clowns are swimming in main tank. \nAlso, there are originally 26 blowfish swimming in an aquarium. So, 26 clowns are swam into side tank which is equal to initial number of blowfish in the aquarium because 26 clownfish and 26 blowfish are swimming in total.  \nThere are initially 50 clownfish swam in the main tank plus 26 blowfish in the display fish tank. Total clownfish is equal to 24+50+24+26 = 100. The final answer is 100 fish in total (14:20).\n\n### Resultant:100, which makes it equal to", "answer": " 16"}

Out of these five, only Homo habilis was the first. Homo erectus and Homo rudolfensis came millions of years later.\n- \n### Input - If there are 33,000 feet in 3 miles, how many feet are in 9 miles?\n\n### Demo - First, let's understand the context of the question - 3 miles =3,000 + 000 feet and this can be simplified to 3 miles = 3,000 ft.\n\n### Since the given number of feet in 3 miles (3,000) is smaller than the given number of miles, using cross multiplication, we can deduce that there will be 33,030 feet in 9 miles.\n### Explanation - I first understand the context of the problem, namely, that 3 miles = 295,832 ft.\n\n## 02-Step Instructions\n### Instruction - Find the smallest prime number.\n### Demo - The easiest way to begin is by looking for two consecutive prime numbers, beginning with 3.

Because 20 less than 40 minutes is what?\n\n### Demination Rationales:\n1.The answer is: 20 minutes\n2.Since the question asks for how many hours he watched TV, one could reason that the answer would be time(hours) of watching TV. As there are 24 hours in a day and each episode he watched was one hour, so how many hours did he watch in a day is the question.\n3.In order to find the answer to that question, one would need to figure out how many hours he watched of TV which is equivalent to multiplying the number of episodes he watched with the running time of each episode which is 20 minutes *2 episodes= 40 minutes. Then, minus 40 minutes since he watched 2 episodes of WoF which means he watched 20 minutes more than 40 minutes so 40-20=20 minutes.

{"text": "425\n\n### Demostration:Mike and Ted had plans to plant a total of 425 tomatoes, however, they disagree on the best use of their time. In the mornings, Mike planted 200 tomatoes per hour while Ted planted 120 tomatoes each hour, so they agree to meet at lunch. Mike's plowing method, planting tomatoes, took 3.5 hours while Ted planted them at a different speed than Mike. Ted's plowing rate was 1/4 of the rate Mike used. After their lunch, Mike planted 360 more tomatoes while Ted only planted 108 more tomatoes. \n\n### Calculation:The total plowed by Mike is 470 tomatoes which is half the total number of tomatoes planted. The total plowed by Ted is 114. Mike planted 4 times as many seeds as Ted over the three time periods, so 4 * 114 = 456 seeds. Multiply by the average planted for a total amount of tomato seeds that were planted, which is 920. This will become the overall amount of tomato sewn.\n\nAnswer: Mike and Ted planted forty two hundred fifty tomato seeds as a whole. The first step is Mike and Ted have plans to plant a total number of 425 seeds. They disagree on best use of their time, so they meet at lunch. The second step is Mike plant 200 plant per hours, Ted planted 150 seeds an hour to plant on first days of work. So then Mike agrees to meet at lunch with Ted. Mike used 3 1/2 hours to plant 360 tomatoes and his plant 200 every hour. He also used to 3 1/5 hour to plant 390 seed for second period while Ted plant 120 seed per hour, so then Ted uses 1 hour to plant 150 seed and then Ted meet with Mike at lunch for the third period then on the third periods Mike plant 360 plants and Ted plant 127 plants to finish planting 410 plants then total amount of plant in first period is", "answer": " 250"}

Choices:  Choices: A: brush teeth B: stop smoking C: get rid of germs D: take care of your teeth E: do not take care of your teeth\nRationales:1. The sentence's context suggests that Josh's mom and Josh are arguing.\n2. Given the context, Josh's mom is probably trying to help Josh take care of his teeth.\n3. A possible argument could arise from Josh disagreeing with his mom's suggestions. Josh's mom would then say that it's time to get his teeth.\n4. The sentence, \"It's now time to get your teeth,\" may imply that Josh's mother wants him to do something to take care of his teeth if he has not done so already. \n5. This means that Josh's mother is probably trying to persuade Josh to brush his teeth. The logical answer choice to indicate someone suggesting that someone brush their teeth is choice B, brush teeth.\n6. Another possibility may occur if Josh did not do a good job brushing his teeth. In this case, his mom may say that it's now time to brush his teeth again. This is indicated by option option D, to get rid of germs.\n7.

A: To Increase production efficiency. This reason for change does not have any change to affect price which increase production efficiency does not affect prices because there is no change in production, so there is no need to increase efficiency in production.\n2.

All of the prices\nRationales: First, a little back-and-forth with the question is required. The question, it turns out, is asking about \"the lowest price where a product CAN BE purchased.\" Since the product cannot be purchased for anything less, the possible options are a and b, and since it is required to purchase something, the question cannot have a price of 6, thus, eliminating it.\n\n### Now we have the options: A, B, or C\n\nThe first thing that needs to be done is to create a flow chart. This is important, because any value can be used. The goal is to decide which value is lowest and whether a different value is cheaper. One thing to remember is that values cannot be repeated: one cannot buy item a for $3 in the first store and same for item b. \n\nFlow chart:\n\n```\nFlowchart\n0\n```\n\nThe value to get is 3 or 5, since these are the lowest values for price a product can be bought for.

To begin, we must define the words in the sentence.\n\n    * _Fish_ can refer to any vertebrate animal belonging to the class of aquatic cold-blooded animals characterized by gills.\n        - It's important here that we know that the words \"fish\" and \"aquarium\" are referring to the same type of vertebrate animal.\n\n        - Since \"goldfish\" are a type of \"fish\", it can be assumed that Catriona has _one_ more \"goldfish\" than \"fish\" total.\n\n    * A _goldfish_ is a species of fish belonging to the family Cyprinidae. \n        - A \"goldfish\" can be defined as a \"fish\" but not a \"guppy\".\n\n        - Since guppies are a type of fish and goldfish are a type of fish, it can be assumed that there are _at least four_ \"fish\" total in Catriona's aquarium since one of them is goldfish.\n\n6. One of the statements given tells us that Catriona has twice as many guppy as angelfish. This means that there must be twice the amount of angelfish as guppies.\n7.

{"text": "The answer is B: 26.6 inches.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question is asking about the total rainfall for this city in November, which is 12.5 inches. The rainfall is given in a step-down pattern, and the numbers are progressively smaller. We would write the answer by simply subtracting the initial value from the final value and then taking the integer. For example: the last part of November was 4 times more than the first part. So 4 x 12.5 = 50 total, which is closer to 12.5. But we take the integer, so we divide the number 50 by 2, which is 1/2, and then multiply by 12.5, which gives 6.125. So the whole amount of rain is 4 + 6.12 (10.12) = 14.12 total inches\n\n### Ex 1\n\n#### Input:\nThe dog had been given a bath a couple hours before the trip.  The next morning they had noticed that the dog was missing 20 pounds in weight since before the bath.  What was the exact weight lost by the dog, in pounds?\nAnswer: E.  Weight lost by Dog: 20.2 pounds\n\n#### Rationale:\nThe math is correct, however I could not get the right answer so I found the rationales. They are actually wrong.\n\nThe dog had been give a bath a couple of hours before the trip. The next morning they had notice that the dog was missing twenty pounds in weight since before and bath.\nSince it was given a bath a couple of hour before the trip, the dog's weight now is at a time where the weights are even between the bath and the trip. So, the weight lost after the bath is the same as the weight lost after the trip.\nNext, after the bath, the dog is supposed to lost twenty pounds. However, the dog was only missing twenty pounds lost after the trip. How can this be?\nIf the dog lost twenty pounds during the bath, it would go to twenty-four pounds in weight lost. Then it would not be missing twenty pounds. Therefore, the dog must have gain some weight after the bath.\nHowever, the dog didn't gain any weight, and only lost twenty pounds and", "answer": " 180"}

This problem is an inference task, where the person is given a bit of information, and a question that requires one to infer what happened, based on the information given.\n2. One of the methods for inference questions is to eliminate the incorrect answers, like B, C and D.\n3. The correct method of solving this particular problem is to subtract the number of variables (like rows, columns and words) that are not in the information given, which is one, from the number of words in the actual crossword (which was given in the problem statement as nine words), and then add that number to two. A possible method would be to multiply two with nine and then subtract one from that number.\n4. To summarize, the answer is two since the number of columns is seven and the number of letters is nine and we don't need to consider words, as letters is what is used in crosswords. It would be easier to say so since the number of variables given is nine, which makes the remaining variable equal to two since it's the ones that", "answer": " 5"}

Hunting in groups is the best way to ensure that you have the ability to take home a deer from the herd. \n3.

The first step is to understand how the question is asking for the rate of pay for Lance:\n- Lance is paid $9 an hour for his work.\n- Lance works 35 hours per week and makes $9 an hour for that time.\n2. There are five workdays in the week.\n3. So, over the course of one week, Lance would make $325 (= 35h * $9/hr).\n4. As a result, for each workday that Lance earns $113. The math is as follows: $113 = $325/5.\n5. Note that we would have been able to get through this problem with just a simple division of 325 by 5.

{"text": "13*8 -4*23(36 - 92).\n\n### Input \n\n### Instructions:\nThe given question is, \"The least-selling book,\" but this is not the only sentence that begins with the words, \"The least selling book.\" In order to determine the meaning of the question, it is important to examine the other options and determine which of those makes the most sense with the information given, as \"TOP\" refers to being a bestseller, while \"ABC\" refers to the book least selling. In this case, only \"ABC\" would be a logical choice that works with the information provided. Therefore, the answer that makes the most sense would be \"ABC book.\" In addition, there is no way to determine the difference between the bookstore's two earnings because it is not explicitly stated. The given sentence states: \"Thirteen 'TOP' books and four 'ABC' books were sold last week,\" which implies that both the thirteen TOP books and the four ABC books were sold last week; this implies that both the bookstore's receipts and expenses had an impact on the store's profits. To make sure that the bookstore had a profit, it is necessary to determine if each option, TOP and ABC, is more expensive or less expensive than the other. In this case, if we assume that both were sold last week, then TOP must be cheaper than ABC since it is a lesser book. \n\n### Rationale\nThe bookstore's receipt for TOP must be 13 * $8 - the total cost of the books. Similarly, the bookstore's expense for ABC must be 4 * $36 - the total cost of all four books. The difference in these two receipts and expenditures is: 13 * $26 (the cost of the least-selling book) - the total cost (the 4 ABC books). Therefore, the bookstore'S earnings on the two books will be 13 *8 -4*26 (which should be a 73 - 112) = -39 dollars.\n\n### Sample Solution: \nIn this question, the bookstore' S earnings on the two book were $13*8-4*26; they lost", "answer": " 12"}

Where did the fence end?\n\n### Rationales: This problem involves a question based on spatial reasoning, which tests one's skills to understand and visualize spatial relationships to solve problems.\n\n### Step 1: Before attempting to answer this problem, let's go through the given instructions carefully to gain a clear and concise understanding.\n\n### The question is asking where the fence ends, which implies that it must be the location at which the cat is unable to jump over.\n\n### There are three possible locations at which the fence ends.\nAt the top of the fences, when the cat is not able to step over the top of the fense.\nAt the bottom of the fence, where the cat is unable to fit through the gap left to climb up the fence.\nA wall is where the fence ends where the gap the cat is jumping over is filled in with a wall.\n\n### To find out the location at which the fence ended, we use the information that the cat was able to jump on top of it, thus we can rule out option A.\n\n### Option B is also ruled out because, as the given context and instructions clearly state, when the cat tried to jump to capture a bird in its jaws, he is unable to capture the bird and this means that the cat cannot jump through the gap or hole that represents the fence, thus option B is also incorrect.\n\n### Finally, we are left with option C, the third location at which the fences can end. As the cat was able to capture the bird and capture it in its jaws, it would make sense that he was able to fit through the hole that this represents.

We can use this relationship of cost over rides to determine which value is chosen to solve this problem\n\nBy setting C equals to r and by setting $2 for X, we find that the formula that represents cost versus rides is C = 2X. C is equal to 2 times X. \n\nTo find a minimum value, you need to set C >= X. \n\nYou have a maximum of 30 days, so that means you need a minimum of 15 days to make the 30-pass strictly more affordable. \n\nSince there is two one way tickets and 15 days, that would mean you have 10 one way tickets. \n\nTo see a visual of this, it will be helpful to plug 10 and 2 into the equation.

{"text": "We need to divide 30 by 1000 in order to get the fraction we need to multiply by 8. 30 divided by 100 is 1/4. 1/4 multiplied by 8 is 2. Divide 2 by 100 and round to the nearest whole number. We get 2/1 as our final answer. Divide 1 decimal by 100 decimal and round the fraction to whole numbers. We should get 1/100 as the answer. When you simplify, you get 4.6%\n\n### Rationale:\nTo answer this question, the task is to divide 30 (the number of students) by 1,000 and multiply this fraction by 8 to get the number of cards remaining to be made, which we assume is 5600. Thus, to solve the problem:\n1.  First, we set up our equation. We plug in the given numbers (30 and 1,00) in order to get our fraction.\n2.  We then divide 30 by an integer (1,000) to bring down the numerator and denominator.\n3.  Once we simplify, the results reduce to 1/40.\n4.  The next step in the process is to multiply the given fraction, 1/40, by an integer (8).\n5.  This yields 1/40 x 8, which equals 8/40.\n6.  We round both denominator and numerator down to the nearest whole number to get 2/40.\n7.  Rounding down the denominator to the nearest whole number we find 2/100.\n8.  To find out what 2/10 equals, we will have to take the fraction and multiply it by its reciprocal, which is 0.02.\n9.  We multiply 2/1 by 0.02 to get 0.04.\n10.  Rounding this answer down to an integer, 0.1 is the final answer.

Jamal loves reading and owns too many books! \n\nB: Cognitive bias\n\nC: Argument to probability\n\nD: Argument to probability \n\nE: Argument to probability  \n\nRationales: Jamal is complaining that his old books were preferable to the ones that were replaced, which indicates some sort of dislike with the replacement, possibly indicating a logical fallacy.\n\n1. Argument to probability occurs when someone assumes that their disliked option is more likely than the favored alternative. \n2. For instance, in our sample question, Jamal could have assumed either that the replacement books were more likely to be burned in the fire because they were new or that the fire was an accident. \n\n1. Example: If Jamal\u2019s assumption is that his burned books are more likely to have been burned because new books are sometimes considered to be more valuable and therefore may have been more vulnerable, this would be an argument to probability.\n2. We can eliminate option B because cognitive bias is essentially bias in cognition, which is the thought process, and in this sample question, Jamal is more focused on the books than his thought process. \n3.

{"text": "In order to solve the task: 1. We need to break it down into smaller pieces and then think about how they would actually translate on a real world run-down. 2. The task is asking to calculate a) the distance travelled by the runners in the given distance/time; b) how many seconds it would take for the cheetah to catch up to a gazelle running at top speed.  3. So in order to do this we had to figure out that if it would take one minute to run 950 feet which means that 90 seconds has gone by. \n4. We also know that the cheetah running at top speed travels 60mph for which it takes 8 seconds. 70 seconds to go 950 feet. 110 seconds to go 60 miles per hour. We now know that the cheetach would catch the gazelle since it takes 70 seconds to 90 seconds. \n5. How ever the same is not true for a gazell running at top speeds which does run at about 40 miles an hour for about 112 seconds at which point the cheetah would catch up to the gazelle, since the cheetah's top speed is 1.5 times that of the gazell's top speed.\n6. We now also know that the cheeta travels 2000 feet per hr since they can travel 2000 in an 8 second which then takes 250 seconds to travel the 4 miles that the gazel could only travel in 112 seconds. \n7.

An option is Rocks collectors, which may be used as a description or as a title, but it does not directly answer the question.\nA different option is River dredgers. While this is not specific to pebbles, it does accurately describe that people use this term for specific types of collectors.

One solution is to multiply her salary by 1.6, which gives her $960. From that number, we subtract the $42 she pays each month, which is $456. Choice A, 963-504-18 is incorrect since it involves subtracting three numbers. Choice B, 960+18 is wrong since she actually pays $504. Choice C, 960*1.6=1560 is incorrect because it does not involve the amount of money she pays the household. Choice D, 80+1.6= 98, is off because it only includes the month's salary of $8$.

{"text": "To begin, it's helpful to first think about what each of these numbers represents - what Fred spent, what he earned, and what he ended up with.\nUnderstanding that the first number is Fred's initial allowance, we know that it is a whole number, greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to 37 (The question asks for a allowance \"that is not more than 30\").\nUnderstanding the second number is the amount Fred earned; therefore it's a whole number and less than 5. \nFinally, the last number, the final balance, is also a whole number; it's less than or equal to the sum of the initial allowance and what Fred earned.\n\nRationales:\n- Option A and Option B would make the second number equal to what Fred spent or less than what he earned, wholes, which are unacceptable solutions.

{"text": "Johnny pays $8366.\n\n### How to solve:\n1. To solve this question, we need to start by identifying the key values and parameters - 1000, the quantity, $0.10, the price of each ball, $8366, the total cost for the whole bulk.\n2. We can determine the total number of balls bought with $10000 since 1000 is the quantity multiplied by $0.10 to obtain the total cost. Thus, we can express this as $1,000 =1000 * $0.10.\n3. This means that the total number of balls Johnny bought if $1000 is $1000 * 0.1 = 10 balls.\n4. To solve this problem, we use this information to substitute into the cost expression of $8366 = 1000 * (1 - 30%) = $1000($0.7).\n5. We can then write $8366  = $100 * (10 + 0.1) * 0.7 = $100($1.73 * 10*0.7) = $100*(1.73*7) = $1,261.6(rounded to $1231.6).\n6.

{"text": "The student's response should describe how John's solo run and how John's dog has been running for 30 minutes affect how much John travels in overall.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe question asks how much John travels after being dragged by his dog for a while and also after running by himself afterwards.\n\nWe can first understand the math. Let's say the rate of travel is expressed in distance per 5 minutes.\n\nSo, by a given 30-minute period, John runs for 6*161.32(15 minutes) = 968.00 feet = 0.19917 miles\n\nAdditionally, in another 30-min run, there is 8*161.22(16 minutes) = 1283.20 feet. That's 0.3 miles!\n\n\nSo, by subtracting the 0.19 miles away from the dog pulling him from the left, we can get that, in total, John loses 0.19 - 0.3 = 0.109 miles.\n\nThen, we subtract the 0.3 miles run alone from the right to find the total distance gained from the dog pulling him:\n\n0.3 - 0.108 = 0.1 miles gained by the dog.\n\nSo, we should end at 0.19 + 0.1 = 0.3 miles gained.\n\nNow, if we do math, we realize that we gained exactly the same amount as if the dog didn't come along at all.\n\n**Note here that if John were doing 6 miles per hour run alone and 3 mi/hr with the dog pulling him, then we'd run for 6*13 (9 minutes) miles in total.\nHowever, since the dog didn't move that fast at all when it was trying to pull John, we can say that John was still running at 6 miles to compensate for the dog's slow speeds and the extra drag of 100 pounds.**\n\nTherefore, John would still have traveled 9 miles total even without being pulled by a 100 pound dog.\n\nThe student's response to this is fine, except that the", "answer": " 5"}

Secondly, look out for the given information that is directly proportional to each other.\n\nIf the answer is true,\n 40 minutes\nIf the answer is false,\nThen, it takes less than 10 minutes to start and end a movie.\n\n### Rationales: \nThe task requires a mathematical problem. The statement in the instruction, \"If it takes just 15 minutes to begin and end\" can be read as \u201cif start time and end time are just 15 mints apart\u201d. Then according to the task requirement, \u201cIf the answer is true,\u201d the total time taken by movie should be equal to or greater than 100 mins. And, because 40 + 10 = 50 mins, we can say \"It takes less than 15 minutes to start and end the movie\".\n\n### Answer: \u201cFalse\u201d\n```\nThen, when the question asks for the total time taken by the movie, we do not add the time and divide the time by the number of players.

The first step is to focus on what a wood cutter can achieve, not what a woodchuck can achieve.\n2. The question is asking, \"How much wood could a Woodchuck chuck, _IF_ they're capable of chucking wood?\" \n3.

The word \"lively\" suggests that the people are engaged in something fun, active, and energetic. Choices D and E, a party and a dungeon, are both possible, but do not accurately describe the context of being a party or playing a game in a dungeon. Choice F is not accurate because while it may be fun, it is generally a quiet location where children take their first steps.

Instead, we find information on television shows or the internet to find information about celebrities if someone was not known before.\n2. Choice B makes sense since we can learn about celebrities by attending their concerts or by watching them on television or the internet.\n3. The question states that \"you can\". How can we find a celebrity to know who they are? Talking to their family might seem like a reasonable choice, but this would make the person a celebrity themselves, not the person we are looking for. We can find about a person who we didn't know from watching TV shows.\n4. Choices D and B both could accurately describe how to find information about celebs, so we cannot choose between them!\n5.

If Mike did 40, Jenny did 2 more than 40, which means Jenny ate 42. It was stated that Jenny ate 2 more than Mike, which is not 42 since Mike did more, and thus Jenny did less.\n2. This would be answered as 5 more, 5. 2 more then 4 more since Mike did less than Jenny, they were equal in chocolates eaten.\n3. This is solved by knowing that if Jenny ate twice as many, Jenny ate less than Mike's 20. Therefore, to add twice the number of chocolates as Mike's, Jenny ate 10 less than Mike if he ate 20.\n4. Jenny ate 60, less than 20. This is because every time Mike ate 2 more, Jenny ate twice more than Mike to keep the same amount eaten.\n5.

Choices: 1. The more milk a cow had, the less cheese it made. Choices: 2. 4+9<10 Choices: 3. 4+9>10. Choices: 4. 4+9!=3+4\nRationales:\n1. To determine if the above statement is an inequality: \n2. The statement describes a situation in which the more milk a cow has, the less cheese is made. \n2. This statement involves a negative correlation between milk and cheese with an inverse relationship.\n2. Therefore, we can conclude that this statement is an inequality as it reflects a relationship with an inverse comparison.\n3. However, if one statement did not exhibit an inverse relationship but rather a direct and positive correlation, the choice would be 4, because any number would yield a direct increase in the outcome. This is the case with: 4+9>5. That is, if the milk of the cow is four units, that is, 4, it will result in nine units, which will be 9, of cheese. In other words, every four units of milk will result in nine units of cheese. The addition of five units would simply make the 5th unit of milk give additional cheese. Thus, the result from 4+9 is greater than the result from 4, i.e., 4+5=9. \n4. Conversely, the addition of 5+9 would yield an outcome of 14, which is more than the 4+9=13.\nSo, if there is no relationship between milk and cheese, the statement would be 2: 4+9<7.  This is because 4+9=4+5=9<7. \nThus, the answer is 3, where 4+9>7.\nAnswer: 3. \n\n## Instruations:\nInput: What three-figure number with a sum of 11 does not end with a 7?

Electric cars may be more advantageous for oil companies as they would help to diversify the market.\n3. The use of electric cars will not just reduce pollution, but it will also reduce costs. \nThe first option is incorrect, as electricity is not the main source of energy in the world, at least in the developed nations. So the argument doesn't make sense. The second option could be an argument for electric companies because they are getting their revenue from multiple sources, rather then one, but it won't help the environment.", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": "John climbs 3 stairs with 70 feet.\n\n### Rationales: 1) In order to solve this problem, we must first understand the nature of the challenge.\n2) By examining the given information, we can see that the first step has 20 steps, which implies that the first staircase is of length 20 feet.\n3) The next staircase has twice as many steps, meaning this staircase is of 40 feet.\n4) The final staircase, the 3rd staircase, has 10 fewer feet than the 2nd staircase, meaning the final number of feet this staircase has is 30.\n5) Now that we have the length of all three staircases, we need to understand that each step is 0. 5 feet long, meaning each step on all staircases is of 0.5 feet in length.\n6) Adding the lengths of the 3 staircases together gives us a total of 70 feet. This total is the total number of feet John climbed.\nAnswer: 70 feet\n\n### Instructions:\nComplete the task.\n\n### Task:\nHow much longer is 32 meters than 12 feet? \n\n### Demos: \n1. First, one must understand that a \"meter\" is the base unit of length in the International System of Units or SI. It is equal to 100 centimeters (cm), and the prefix \"kilo\" means thousand. When we say 32 meters, that means 32 thousand centimeters. \n2. The same calculation applies when we compare it to \"ft\", but since a foot equals 12 inches, and so there are 12 * 3.54 inches in one foot (1), we first consider the 12 feet. That means there are 12 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 3.54 =156 inches in 12 ft.\n3. Therefore, 32 meters is 32 \u00d7 4.33 \u00d7 156 =19947.25 inches, and 32 meters is exactly 32 km, meaning that 12 feet = 32 meters is almost 1.379% longer.", "answer": " 45"}

The question states that John is a salesperson who makes $3 percent of the sale and $5 percent of the store's sale. \n\n2. The first salesperson, John, is given as selling 40 cans, which represents 3 percent of the sale. The total sale is 214 canisters of food, which is 5 percent of the total sale. There is no store profit, because, as we know, this will be absorbed by the store. \n\n3. Mary sells 60 cans of food, which represents 33 percent of the sale, which is higher than John's 3 percent; however, she still only gets 5 percent because 214 is 5 percent of 429 for the store.\n\n##Answer:\nJohn sold 40 units, which is 3 percent of his total. \nHis store sold 214 of the units, which is 5% of their total, leaving him 254,  with a total profit of $16.75, calculated as $1.69 x 254.\nTheir combined profit would be $22.46. \nMary earned 33 percent of her store's total sale; she sells 63 units, which is (33/100)429, which is $5.67 in profit, calculated as $1 x 5.67.  \nThe store total profit would be $28.13, which is 5(214)33\n\n\nInput: \n> I was born in London, England and moved to the", "answer": " 120"}

Choices: A: Country B: Jazz C: Dance D: Metal E: Rap\nRationales:\n1. The question asks what type of music sounds better with comfort. Country is an option. But it isn\u2019t a music genre that would typically be used to describe an action of being comfortable. (e.g. \u201cCountry songs are great for when one is feeling lazy and comfortable\u201d, or \u201cCountry music is great for when one is comfortable.\u201d)\n2. Jazz is an option. It also does not describe an action related to comfortable. (e. g. \u201cJazz makes me feel comfortable.\u201d or \u201cJazz is best when one is comfortable.\u201d). \n3. Dance is the only option that is a response choice that mentions that it sounds better with a person\u2019s body comfortable (e.g. dancing makes me feel so comfortable.\u201d or \u201cDance is best when one is calm and comfortable.\u201d).

The question is about what kind of music one enjoys more when being calm and comfortable. \n2. In terms of the available choices, Jazz music is typically associated with relaxation. This is evident in many common phrasing such as \u201cJazz music is relaxing\u201d, \u201cListening to Jazz is relaxing\u201d, and \u201cJazz is good to listen to when one is relaxed.\u201d\n3. Rap music is typically associated with high-end energy and adrenaline-inducing activity. The fact that this description is not consistent with the phrases that describe Jazz, gives a hint that Rap is not more comfortable sounding than Jazz.\n4. However, metal music is generally associated with high-octane, fast-paced musicality. A choice of this genre would certainly contradict the description that one is calm and", "answer": " 70"}

{"text": "John would make $50 an hour\n\n### Rationales:\nFirst, we identify the given statement - \"John works a job that allows for performance bonuses. He makes $80 per day and works for 12 hours.\"\n\nThe question then wants us to determine what would happen if John chooses to get the performance bonus, which implies that he'll work more after the bonus to receive it.\n\nReviewing the additional information, we see that the bonus John chooses to get would entail that he work for an additional 2 hours with the workday being 14 hours total.\n\nThis implies that the hourly wage John earns is $50 since they make $80 per day, so we can equate 14 hours with $80 and know that each hour of the bonus is $5. Thus, John is paid $50 an hour as their hourly wage. \n\n### Input:\"Why did the man throw salt in the water?\"\n\n### Response:\"The man threw salt in the water to make the water salty because previously the water was not salty. \"\n\n### Rrationales:\n1.

Once at the bank, Alice realizes that 20% are iron nickels worth 3 dollars each. From here we can conclude that the rest would be nickels. 20% is equal to 20 nickels. 25 is divided by 20 to get 125%. To convert decimal to percentage, we multiple the number by 0.1 and in this case it is: 80% = 8 * 0.1 = 0.8.  We plug in the two percentages into our formula to get: $3.00 * (0.8/100) = $0.65.\nFor the other portion of the problem we need to add $0.65 to $65 to get $656.65.\n\n### Input:\"Where can a person buy chewing gum?

Choice: A: Oil Refineries B: Wall C: Shower;D: Your own home E: Water fountain\nRationale:First, in order to answer the question \"where could you find some plueming that would not be useful if you are thristy\" we need to consider the given options and what type of plueming they are.  A Wall has plueming built-in, and the purpose of said plueming is to provide water for someone to drink.  A shower contains plueming which serves as outlets where someone can use water to wash their body. A persons home typically has plueming installed and they are used to provide water for drinking.  A water foution supplies water for drinking and that is its purpose.  This does not sound like oil refineries as they don't contain any pluing", "answer": " 64"}
{"text": "Two-thirds more \n\n### Rationales:The question tells us that Gail has two fish tans and that the first one is twice the size of second tank. Then, to solve this prompt, we must determine the number of gallons in the first tank and compare it to the second tank. We also need to determine the density of the fish to each tank.  After determining the fish density, we must determine how many gallons of water they represent. Finally, we must determine how much water each of the tanks hold and how many gallons of each the tank holds and how many fish each tank holds.Then, we need to find the total number of fish in each tank. Then we must determine the number and total of each tank and compare that to one of the first tank's fish consume another.   \n\n### Demostration:To begin, we know that the first tank is twice the second. This means it has the same number of gallons as two times the second tank. Then we determine that the first tank has 48 gallons. We determine the number of gallon equals the number of fish inches of fish and 1 gallon equals one inch of fish. We determine we need to set up two equations equaling one another. We determine that for the first tank we shall have two inches of fish equals six gallons of water(based on the ratio of 1 to 1). Then, for the second tank, we determine we shall have three inches of fish equals nine gallons of water. We determine that the first tank's density of fish equals 6 gallons and the second tank's density of water equals 9 gallons. Then, we shall take the first fish tank's density and multiply it by the original gallons in the fish. To find the total amount of fish, we must first determine the fish in the two tanks. Then we shall subtract the smaller tank from the larger tank. If one fish eats the other, the smaller tank will have less fish and fewer gallons of water in it. We subtract one in the answer and determine the two-thirds are more fish.\n\n### Input How many times did it rain by the time that the farmer got home to his village yesterday.

{"text": "1.524 \n### Input:Sarah, Tanya, and Sara are 3 teachers' aids. Sarah works in an elementary art classroom. She also works in an after-school soccer classroom. Tanya works in an elementary art room. She also works in the after-school soccer room. Sara works in the kindergarten classroom. She also helps out in the first-grade classroom. How many days does each helper work in each room?\n\n### Solution: Sarah helps in an elementary art room once in six days. Also, she helps in the after-school room twice in six days. Therefore, Sarah helps in the art room 70% of the time and helps in after-school 30% of the time.\n \n### Example: In the table here, each number refers to one of Sarah's days. How many times does Sarah aid in the after-school classroom per day?  2\\*5 = **10**\n \n### Solution:\nIn the table here, the 3rd row means Sarah helps in art classroom thrice in the first five days. In the first row, the 1st column means Sarah helps in the art classroom once in six days. Similarly, the other four numbers in that row are how many times she assists in that classroom in five days.\nSo the overall representation for that row is that she helps in the classroom 70% out of six. Therefore, the first question is easy if we write the column number 1 in the 1st column, and the number 2 in the 2nd column. This is because, in each column other than the first, the question is counting how many times Sarah helps in the artroom in five days. So, for the first row we have to place the number 6 in the first column, i.e. the column corresponding to the first row, and place the number 5 in all other columns since the previous 4 numbers have already been calculated.\n\nThe second question is counting the number of times the afterschool classroom is being aided over 6 days. For this purpose, we must put a 1 and a 2 in the second column or row and so on in each column.  3\\*2 = **6**\n\nThe third question is the one that needs to be explained.", "answer": " 258"}

Second of all, understand what the question meant. The question tells us 48 cans sparkling water sold at $12.0  and a 12 cans sparkling water at $6.00, how much more expensive per can in cents is this at the grocery. \n\nThe question mentions that at a warehouse sells case of 48 cans and at a grocery sells case of 12 cans, so they do not only offer 12 cans to the public. In other words, they sell more than 8 cans, which can be used to find a per can price for the warehouse. This can of sparkling water at warehouse sells more cans sold at 12.00 case to sell, so we can find a per can price as the 12/12th of the case price, that is $1.00 a can. Now we do the same for the grocery, the 12 cans sold at $6.0. We can say that the $6.00 a case can of sparkling water sells more than just 1 case at the grocery, so we can find the per can price for the grocery as 6/12th of $6.00. $6.00/6 is $1.0, so we multiply $1.0 by 8 to get the grocery per can price $8.00 a can, we can say that the deal at the grocety store is 1.25 times as expensive as the deal at the warehouse. 8.00-8. 0/1.25 gives us 750, and this is how much more expensive a per can price at the grocery is than the price at the warehouse", "answer": " 25"}

Total so far = 30 flights. Now we have to count the the 3 elevator rides. (3 * 1 = 3 flights).  We count the stairs 1 time less because we were already counting the elevator rides.

(50$) and the fourth quantity (200%) are all given. They are being compared in this problem to find the last quantity, total filming cost.\n\n1. For the first quantity, the rate of increase in length from 2 to 360 minutes is 60%. We know that this means 60% is added to 2h.\n\n        -A film that's 2 hours long is 2/60 as long as a film that is 60 minutes long.\n\n        \n        We can simplify 1.6 to 0.6, as they both represent the 60% for which it is added to. \n\n        Also 60% of the 60 % increase is just (40% * 0.6) = 0.24, which is added to 60, resulting in 84 minutes. \n\n        The same could be said in decimal form:\n\n        60%/60%/2 hours is: 0. 6/0. 4/1. 2 = 31.25 \n    \n1. To get the middle quantity from the first quantity, we do an exponentiation since the first quantity is multiplied by the second, since 60% of a film is 84 minutes more, we want the film that comes out of that. To get that rate, we do 1.2 2/ 1.6.\n\n       .  \n\t\t0.24 x 0.12 \n\t\t.24 x.12 \n\t \n\t8.56 minutes = 0", "answer": " 1920"}
{"text": "Answer: 4 trees.\n\n### Rationale for Response:\nThe answer we get is 4. Why?\n\n\nSo, you have 20 trees, because each tree has 20.  Then, when you multiply 20 by 60%, you can get to 12, which is the amount of seeds that you plant for each tree. Which means, 20 x 60% = 12. Let's do 20 x 30% in the same way. 20 x 50%, you don't get the 12.\n\nAnd now you can get a total of 24 for 20 x 100% and it works for 20 x60%. And if you add 24 + 24, you get a total of 48, which is 3 times and 9 is the total number.\n\nAnd once we have that, by subtracting that number by 4, it will come to 4\n\n### Input :In a large classroom, there are 4 students.  If you divide the class into 2 teams of 2 and each team has an equal number of students, how many teams can be formed? \n\n### Response :Answer 2 teams. \n\n### Rationales \nSo the question says if we put 4 students in 2 teams we have to equate 2 teams. And it goes on to say that 1 team has 3 students. And 2 teams has 4 students. So what we can see is 3 and 4.\n\nNow, we have to equalize them. And if we consider the number of groups formed by team, we find that it is 2. Because it is in terms of groups formed, we can find that this case only happens for both 3 and 4, which it is 2 teams formed. \n\nSo we don't need another team because it can only come down to 2.

I created an outline and wrote my goals of what I want to accomplish.  I took note of which items I would need as I worked on my goals.  For example, I noted that I need scissors to trim paper at certain times.  Which set of actions would lead to me being the most organized with my work.  What is the next action in the sequence?\n\n### Rationale:\n \nThe answer is the next logical step of writing my goals and creating an outline. It's crucial to note that it was necessary to write the goals and outline first, as this is the foundation of establishing my goals and objectives. The step of writing my goals is a significant component of becoming organized; without them, it would be impossible to establish a framework and determine what needs to be completed. The task of creating an outline is a crucial step in accomplishing this goal, as it acts as a roadmap for completion. \n\n### Input:\"What is a list of foods to stay away from?\".\n### Rational:The best answer to this question is water, since drinking water is a necessity for maintaining good health and nutrition and to stay hydrated, drinking plenty of water is crucial.

In this case, the word \"endurance\" is defined as the capacity to maintain long or repeated physical exertion or exercise. In sports, endurance is often measured by the total time a participant can withstand physical activity or exertion without stopping to rest. Rowing appears to require the most endurance, as the contest lasts for a long duration of time, often more than two hours, and involves a high level of physical activity during that time.\n\nSecondly, let's examine what sets rowing apart from other sports. Many athletic events, like swimming, running, or cycling, require endurance and are very strenuous physical efforts, but these activities involve repetitive movements that work only part of the body, such as the legs or arms, reducing the overall workload.

Gary borrowed the money for the used car from his dad.\n2. His dad said he could repay him the total cost of the loan over 5 years.\n3. Gary chose to repay the loan in 2 years.\n4. Thus, Gary would need to make more than the standard 59 payments over 5 years to have enough to cover the total loan cost.\n\n**Response:**\n1. In order to reduce the length of his loan and the amount of interest charged by making higher monthly payments, it is necessary to pay the loan amount back faster than it would take to repay it in 5 years.\n2. The question asks for the amount of money Gary will need to pay each month to repay the loan amount over 2 years.\n3. The initial cost of the car is $6,001, which means Gary needs to repay $6,004 24 payments ($144 x 24 payments) in the case of a full 2-year payment plan.\n4. Given that he will be repaying the total cost of the car, $6,005, over 2 years instead of over 5 years, Gary's monthly payment per month is increased to $1,301.46.\n5. Therefore, the amount Gary will have to pay per month in order to repay the loan over 2 years instead is $144.22 more than what he will pay over 5 years. The amount is equivalent to $1,325.68 + $144.33 = $1,469.91 which means he will have to pay $1,461.91 more each month.", "answer": " 150"}

So let's start there:\n\n1. x + 5\n2. ((x + 5) * (x - 2))\n3. (x + 5)(x - 2)\n\nSince the brackets contain the multiplier, we don't need to evaluate them.\nTherefore:\n```javascript\nlet result = x*x-8;\n```\n\nThe next step is to evaluate the exponent by taking the square root of both sides.\n\n```javascript\nlet resukt = Math.sqrt(x^2 - 8);\n```\nNow we can plug in the numbers and get:\n\n21*25 - 8 = 512 - 8 = 494 - 8 = 37 - 8 = 29\n\n# 2\nLet's keep it simple.

{"text": "Bran still needs to pay $45 (Answer)\n\n### Demostration:\n1. To begin, we need to break down the available sources of income. We are considering the scholarship, which should be applied in full towards the tuition fee. The $15 salary from the part-time job is a recurring income but too small to pay for the entire $90 bill; we need to consider other income sources.\n2. To make the problem easier, we will simplify the question and assume the $90 is due immediately. That means that Bran will need to find $90 from other income sources.\n3. Bran can not find $90 in 3 months through a single income source, we need to calculate the interest on Bran's current income sources and see how much it would be to pay off the entire tuition fee at 0% interest. In this case, the answer will just be Bran's monthly income times by 3 months (the number of months to pay off the entire invoice).\n4. The interest needed will depend on how long it is till Bran will have the cash (the amount of income sources) to pay off the entire $90 invoice. In the above equation, the amount of 45 is Bran's total monthly income minus what he needs to pay for the tuition this month.\n5. In the beginning, Bran doesn't have the $15/month. We are going to use an imaginary interest rate, as well as the compound interest formula to figure out how much Bran needs to save each month in order to have the money to pay his entire bill within three months. This can be done via the equation: FV = (Principal * [1 + r/100])^n (where FV = Future Value, r = current interest rate, and n = number of periods)\n\n6. We need to begin with the amount of 90 for the invoice. We then multiply this number by the 1 + r/1% rate, and then by a power of 3 (0.003) which equals 0.03. This means that every month, Bran needs to increase his current income from his tuition bill.\n7. Therefore the formula for Bran's income increases will be:\n\nI = P*(1 + i/n)^n\n\n8", "answer": " 18"}

During this escape, the lizard has left its starting location and has sought shelter at a random location.\n2. Considering the options provided, I eliminate the options of forest, desert, and lake.

Assuming one coat (15 skins) is made from one mink, there are 30/2(1-1/2) = 12 minks remaining.\n\n### Response 2:\nWe find how many coats could be made from all the remaining minks by multiplying it by 15. This is then subtracted from the total of 30 minks. The remainder is then divided by 30 which is 15, the number of coats one mink could make out of 15 skins. Thus, the maximum number of coats one can make is equal to 2 - remainder = 2 - 30/30. \n\nInput: I found a book, and a chair nearby. What was further away?

{"text": "1. The question asks us how many cupcakes Anna has left over.\n2. From the information given, we know that Anna sold 60 cupcaks and gave 4/5 of her cupcakes to her friends.\n3. Therefore, Anna has 1/5 of her cupcake remaining.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The problem can be represented in a number line.\n2. We can begin by finding the equivalent value of the \"1\" in the \"1/5\" fraction.\n3. Since 1/5 has a denominator of 5, we can find the equivalent of the \"1\" by dividing 1 by 5.\n4. The equivalent value is 0.2.\n5. From there, we can calculate how many remaining cupcakes Anna has.\n6. We know there are 60 cupcates in total and that Anna gave away 4/5.\n7. This means there would be 4 x 0.4 = 1.6 cupcakes to Anna, which then leaves 60 - 1.6 = 58.4 cupcakes.\n8. We can round this up to 59 since the only value that can be rounded up from 58.4 is 59.

Every month has four weeks.\n4. One degree takes 4 years (for simplicity) and one graduate degree takes 2 years - a total of 6.\n5. Hence, there are 12 months for every 6 years, and 1 graduate degree to be taken every every 6 months.\n6.

After subtracting the 30 pounds, we add the 30 pounds and we get a number of 70 pounds, which would be half of the full adult weight.\n\nWe know that the puppy reached its full adult weight by adding an extra 30 pounds after 11 months.\n\nTherefore we also know that the puppy had more than 30 pounds before it reaches its full adult weight.\nIn this puppy's stage, its weight was 30+30+30(extra pounds) pound, which means the puppy weight could reach up to 90 at any of the stages, meaning the puppy started to grow from 0(pounds) to 90(pounds) in 2 years or 4 months.\nThe dog reached its full adult weight at the age of 1.5 years \n\nNow, subtracting 30 pounds from its full adult weight of 100 pounds would leave us with a dog's weight of 70 pounds.\n\nNow, the dog started to double in weight every 2 months, hence, it had 3 months, then 4 months, then 5 months and so on..\n\nEach time the dog doubled in weight, it doubled it's weight by 30 pounds, meaning it took on a 30-pound-weight in 1.5 years or 1 year, respectively. \n\nRound off its weight to nearest tenth = 70 = 71\n\nIt is in the golden retriever phase in the second year", "answer": " 78"}

Last year, every Monday afternoon that came after school, Sarah would be doing nothing more than cleaning. Last summer, on no Sunday after school during the month of June, did Sarah's family allow her to go to the basketball game. How many days did Sarah go dancing last Sunday?\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. The question is focusing on Sarah, who used to go dancing weekly and stopped last year.\n2. Sarah is now sixteen, and a teenager typically does not go to basketball games, so the question asks about summer activities rather than weekly routines.\n3. The questions mentions a pattern, which Sarah is unable to repeat because something has changed.\n4. In the case of Sarah, the answer can be found by considering her weekend routines before the summer of 2022.\n5. There is one answer choice that follows the pattern. Choice E represents this sequence, so it must go dancing at the basketball game on the last Sunday it can.

First review the given choices. The given choices of the three holes in the question are in order of size, as the smallest is leaking 1/3 as much as the medium-sized, and the medium is leaking one-half that of the largest.\n2. The largest hole leaks 3 oz per minute. \n3. So over a 2-hr time period, it leaks a total of 48 oz (2 hrs x 3 oz).\n4. The medium-sized leaks at 2 oz per minute. So over a 12-min time period, it leaked 24 oz.\n5. At the time, there are 3 holes, but the smaller-sized is empty.\n6. Therefore the total water emitted over a 2- h time period by the three holes will be (48 + 24 - 3 ) = 48 oz + 9 oz + 3 = 60 oz.\n7.

{"text": "It would take Veronica 110 minutes to pit all the cherry. Rationales:  Lets convert the question into units that are easier and appropriate.  To convert 25 pounds of cherries to ounces, we start off by dividing 16 ounces per pound by  16(1/16) = 1  Now, using this formula and the units of time expressed in the problem, the minutes converted to hours is: 1+24=25  So, 1 hour = 80 minutes  So the question states it takes 20 cherries to pit one pound of cherry, but if you look it down to pits, per cherry takes 4 minutes, so how long would it take you to pitting all the cherries.\nThis is the question they are asking for, and you find the answer to this question in the next line.  10 minutes = 0.2(10) = 2   So, in 2 minutes, you can pit to 80 single cherry.   We multiply minutes to get hours, and  2 = 25 minutes =  1 hour  And 80 single cheries = 7 hours\nSo,  80 single cherries take 2.5 minutes and to pit, we multiply by 2, so its takes 5 minutes to pit 1 pound of cherries and  1(5) = 5  So, for 10 minutes, its 20 minutes of pitting and for 1 hour  20 minuites = 24  It takes 5 minutes to pitt 1 pound of cheryies so 1(5) =  5  And 1(5) after 10 = 50  So, 50 minutes to pit 10 pounds of pitted cherry.   So to convert to time we find the minutes to do it by 20 minutes, which we have already used up so  1(5) + 20 = 60 minutes to pit, so 10 pounds = 90 minutes.   But, we have to use 5 times since you will need to pit 50 5(5) = 25\nSo, its 90 minutes to pit 50 pounds of cherries, so 100 pounds of cher", "answer": " 2"}

Now consider the options of 500K and 1000K.\n5. If Sandy chose to split up the tokens in a 500K distribution, she would have 500K Safe Moon tokens and each of her siblings would have 400K Safe Moons.

Also, there is a chance that her siblings could hold more than Sandy in this scenario as they can split the 1M Safe Moon tokens between themselves to have more Safe Moon tokens.\n9. Hence, since Sandy's sibling's share can decrease or even go below Sandy, option 1000 K does not satisfy the instructional statement. As such, option 500 K is the correct answer and option 100K is not the correct answer.\n10. Therefore, the answer to this problem is option 500K, which Sandy holds more more Safe Moon tokens that her siblings.\n### Answer:500K\n\n### Input\nJohn got what for his birthday?

In this question, we are asked to choose a time to go see the doctor. If it is a head cold, it is not at all the time, but could be several weeks from now. If it is sinusitis, then it is a perfect time to go see a doctor about your sinus condition.\n- Choose the best answer: The best time to see a doctor about your Sinusitis.\n- Ratiocination: To answer the question posed, we have to decide upon the best time to see a medical professional and have your sinuses examined. For this, it is important to consider the question to have three parts. The first is to figure out if you have sinusitis, and if it is appropriate to check your sinuses at this time. The second part is understanding that if you have sinus infection that sinusitis should not be present, so which of the other two conditions is most relevant now? Thus, we have a two-step process:\n1. Step 1 (to figure out if you have a sinus infections: Think about the symptoms and if you have any of the four major symptoms for sinusitis.\n2. Step 2 (to figure out if now is a good time to go check your sinuses): Now that we have figured out if we have sinusitis, we determine if it is the present.

In this case, The answer to that question is 60.\n### Rationale 1: The first line of reasoning to determine the answer to this question is to understand what is happening. Therefore, we can look at the choices (A) to (D).\n### Choice (A) asks us how many visitors went to the library last Monday. On Monday, there were 50 visitors to the library. \n### Choice(B) asks for the number of visitors who went on Tuesday. With twice as many, 100 visitors, went on Tuesday and it tells us that the total number of visitors  went to the library on Tuesday. 60 went to the library every other day of that week. \n### There is not enough information presented to answer these 2 questions completely. The only thing is how many visitors have gone to the library on the given week and that's 60.\n### Choice C and D asks about what the library received in an average for the remaining days. However, they are not asking for the total number of visitors. To arrive at that conclusion, we have to look at the options provided(A) and (B) and then do arithmetic.\n### Add( 50+100+20 = 270)and divide (270/7=38.57)\n### Rounded off: 38.57\n### Total: 60\n\n#### For another word problem: \nQuestion: \nHow many more people visited the library this week than came in during Monday?

{"text": "The clothing will earn $200\n\n### Demostraion:Solving this problem starts with identifying the data given and then organising the information into equations. In this case, it is simple enough to divide the information directly into equations.  \nWe can set up an equation by first establishing that the clothing store sells $200 worth of clothing.  This gives the equation $200 = $20 x $sales$ + $x$\nNext, we can substitute for $sales$. Since we were given that there were twelve (12) of each pair and shirt, and that \"10\" is the number we were to substitute in, we get $200 = ($20 x 12) + 10 $\n$200 - 240 = x $\n$240 = x  $\n \nSubtracting the $240 from both sides results in an equation $200$ - $240$ = $x$\n\nWe know that $10 x 20 = $200$, so we can substitute:  $10 x( 20 x 1 + 1 ) = $200$\n$10 x (21 x 10) = $200$.\n$2100 = $2100. \nWe notice a pattern from our equation of what is being multiplied when we multiply the 10 by the numbers.  The $2100$ can be rearranged as $2100 = 10 x \\frac{(21)}{1}$.\n \nIn order to isolate our variable \"x\",we need to find its equivalent fraction.  However, we can simplify the equation by switching out the numerator and denominator with 1, which results in $2100/10 = 210$.\nThus, we can equate our equation as $ 2100 = x + 210 $\n$1980 = 21(99) $\n$1990 = 21 x 9 $\n$3980 = 99(x) $\n$1500 = 99 x $ \n$150 = 9$ x", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "Ans: 1760\n \n### Rationales: Firstly, we need to examine each of the two main factors that influence how much fuel a plane needs in order to fully understand the context of the problem. \n \n1. The empty plane's weight multiplied by the distance will directly determine how much fuel the plane can carry with it. (20 gallons * miles) = Gallons\n2. Each additional person will require 3 gallons more fuel per mile traveled because the additional masses require more fuel to overcome inertia and to generate lift. (3 gallons/mile)(n) = Gallons\n3. Similarly, each additional bag requires an extra 2 gallons of fuel per person because of the added weight. (2 gallons/mile)(m) = Gallons\n \nNow the question presents us with some data: \nThere are 30 passengers total. (30 Passengers)\nEach passenger brings two bags. (2 bags/person)\nAll passengers together constitute a total of 5 flights crew members. (5 Crew members)\nThere are a total of 30 passenger plus 5 crew members, total of 35 individuals.

{"text": "51 pieces of fruit\n\nRationales: Given:  Bucket A has 5 more pieces of fruit than Bucket B while Bucket B has 4 more pieces than Bucket C and Bucket C has 9 pieces. \n- If you have one bucket, it will have the highest number of pieces. - So, bucket A has 13 pieces and bucket B has 9 pieces. Now, from bucket C we can deduct 9 which leaves us with 0 pieces in bucket C which means bucket C has 0 pieces. So, there are 9 pieces on the top and 0 pieces on the bottom, therefore we have 9+0 = 9 pieces in bucket A \n- Now suppose we have two buckets, bucket A and bucket B. We know that these two buckets are made from 9 and 4 pieces respectively. So, the total is (9 + 4) = 13; this is because of how we calculated, 13 pieces are on top and 0 pieces are on the bottom. - So, there are 13 pieces on top and 0 on the bottom, which makes 13+0 = 13 pieces in bucket A. Again, we know that there is 13 pieces on the top and we know that bucket B has 9 on the top, hence total number of pieces is 13+9 = 22 pieces. - Finally, suppose we have all the three buckets. We know that we have 9 pieces in bucket C and 22 pieces in bucket B and 13 pieces in A which means the total is (9+22+13) = 44 pieces. \n- As we know that the question has 9 pieces in total, 9 is divisible by 3, hence, to find out the number of buckets, we multiply the no. of pieces by 3.\n - So, the answer (and question itself) is:\n 51 pieces of fruit. - As we have a bucket of each number and each bucket is holding pieces of fruit, therefore total no. of pieces is (9+23+13) =43. Now 43 is divisible by 2, so we multiply it by 2 to get the correct answer.", "answer": " 37"}

Next, the price of the soil was added to the price of the clay pot to find out that it's $2 less than what the clay pot costs. Therefore, by subtracting the price of the soil from what they clay pot costs, the answer was calculated to be $21.\n3. Subtracting this number ($21) from $9 yields $12. This means that the total cost of the items is $12 if we include the price of the soil too.\n4. However, $12 was the only thing added to get that number.

How many extra eggs will they need to have if they have a shortage with what they get?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nI'll just take the number of eggs and I'll divide it over the eggs that they will need.  So we start with the young children, we know young children can have a half an omelet, that's 0.5 of one omelet. So to get 0.5 of an omelet, we will actually need 50 eggs, because each egg provides the 1 egg that makes one omelet. We know that the children will eat a half omelets, so that makes sense, that they could have 50 eggs. Then what would go for the older children, so the older children would not be able to handle the whole omelet. So they would be at the limit of an omelet with the half omelet. That would also require 50 eggs, too, for the older children, because it is half 1. And we end up with young children, we have the 50, and we have the older children, we have another 50. So 1 whole egg make 1 omelet. Next we divide between the two, and for adults we know that adults eat 2 omelets, so we have 2 in 1 omelet, we end up by having to use another 50 eggs, so 100, or 2 eggs for one omelet. For the seniors, we know seniors, don't eat as much as the adults do, seniors only eat 1 omelet and a half because they are older but they still have their life left in them because they are seniors.

What is the number of steps he takes before the exercise?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: John needs to take at least 16 steps before the exercise. His first exercise is skipping rope, then he'll walk to his next exercise, which involves climbing monkey bars. There are 8 monkey bars, so he must take 12 steps to each bar and then back, which gives him a total of 96 steps.\n\nRationales: There are two reasons this is true.\n1. Skipping rope involves a number of actions (jumping, skipping, swinging a rope forward, swinging a roap back) and at each completion of these actions, a skip consists of three counts, and so it is reasonable to estimate that skipping a rope involves about 36 steps.\n2. He will walk to his next exercise which involves climbing eight monkey bars. Climbing 8 monkey bars is equivalent to walking 40 feet (since one bar is 5 feet long, each would be 1/5 of 40 feet). Since these 40 feet represent walking between bars, it can be estimated a step would be equivalent to about 2.5 feet, or 10 feet in total, for the walking part.\n\nConclusion: He must take at least steps before the exercise, and because taking 15 steps is not equal 0, we can deduce the minimum number of steps are 16 (i.e., 0 < 16).\n\nAnswer: 16\n\n### Input :While working out, the treadmill goes up to what speed?\n\n###Demonstration:\nInput : 2 mph\n\n###Rationales:\n1.

How many times does that equal 30?\n\n### Output:It equates to three times.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We can look at it this way:\n   - 30 = 15 x 2;\n   - but, since 30 = 2^1 * 5, it means that it's 1 5, times 3, or the 1 in 5 times 3.  \n2. Or,\n   - The equation 30 = 3 * 15 is equivalent to 2 * 15 = 3, which can be seen as the 1 (from 15 = 2^0 * 5)\n3. Since the latter is simpler, you may reasonably choose to rewrite the problem to 30 = 6 * 5, or you could write (a) 30 = 5 * 6 (b) 30 = (5 x 2) which are both the same.\n\n### Solving the Task\n\n1. The first step would be to create a list of all the possible answers. One easy way to create the list of possible answers is by brainstorming a list. For each of the answers listed, consider how the question is phrased and whether any of them provide a suitable match.\n2. Next, we must ensure that each of the alternative answers meets all of the conditions listed in the question.\n3. If you come to any of the answers that do not meet the requirements, you may choose to use a technique known as rule removal.\n4.

At first, Ben's production capacity may seem good.  However, the more you think about it, the less likely that his production capacity is sustainable in the long run.\nAs a worker himself, Ben would likely already feel overworked and overstretched.  The work environment is not ideal for a healthy body and well-being.  It is inevitable that Ben would feel more fatigued and less productive as the workload increases.\n### Answer\n  I would hire Ben because he is very productive given the 8-hour shift.  However, given the limited number of hours set aside for building each chair, it wouldn't be enough to complete 5 chairs in just 5 hours.  If we take 10, 8-hour shits to build 5 chairs, we'd only be able to build 1 chair for Ben to finish.  Also, given that each worker is limited to only one shift a day to avoid fatigue, Ben would only be working 10 hours a day.  Therefore, he would not have the capacity to build 1 chair a day.

She starts the week with 500 mp3 songs.  This means, Aisha had 500 songs the first week. \n3. She adds another 508mp3 the week after that (which gives us a total of 1000 mp3 songs). \n4. As she does not like many of the song, (508mp3),she gets to remove (50 mp3). (508mp - 50mp3 = 458mp3) which means, she now has 458 songs in her mp3 the second time. \n5. As she had 500+550 songs in her mp3 player the first time (500+ 550), by simple subtraction; we can write her mp3 songs for that week as [(1/2)((550+500) + 500 ]mp3 songs. \n6.

{"text": "The answer is C. 18 loaves.\n\nThe key is knowing that every gram of flour baked into one loaf is two grams of flour left over to be baked later. But, this comes at a 50/50 rate. This means half of the grams will always be baked first, and the other half will be baked together. In this case, that means that on average, each gram of flour would provide two loaves, so since Jim has 700 grams, he would have 35 loaves. This is because a gram of flour can only produce two loaves.\n\nIn the second case, half of the leftover grams will stay over, and the rest can be used for each loaf, so it will average another 7.5 loaves.\n\nThis means, overall, Jim will be able to provide 42.5 loaves with every 700 grans of flour. This is because every 100 grams will give him 5 loaves on average, so the average of the averages will amount to 72.5 (5 + 7.5). In the second round, Jim can add that 100g on top of the 42.5 he already made. This will give him 32.5 more loaves.\n\nThus, he has 75 loaves overall.\n\nHowever, this doesn't take into account that 285g is already being used. This means we can subtract that amount from the original 615g we started with.\n\nThus the answer is 615 - 285 = 320 grams. This, in turn, gives Jim a total of 37.5 loaves (75/2).\n\nThis is because his flour supply has 72.5 loaves and 28.5 loaves left. This means he has 80 loaves in total. However, his flour supply is 715 grams, and he consumed 285.13 grams already for the 37.5 he made.\n\nSo, he has 337.37 grams left over.

The question asks what Annabelle's choice is in buying what: junk food OR sweets (she's deciding between those two; it is not about junk or sweets in general). \n3.

The first hundred years are 847 people, the second hundred years are 1694, the third hundred years are 3388. We can reason the answer. The monster feasts on a ship because one hundred ships are lost a hundred years. We can assume that the people on all of these ships is the same (one hundred). There were 847 people on the first hundred ships, and 847 people ate by the monster. On the second hundred ships, there were one hundred people on each ship, so there were ten thousand people on the second hundred ships. From just the second hundred years' ships, 1694 people were eaten by the monster. There were then ten thousand people on the third hundred ships, so there were one hundred thousand people a century who ate by the monsters.

He collects some seawater. The salt volume percentage of seawater is 20%. He wants some salt to make his fish taste better. How much salt will Jack collect in total when all the water evapourates?\"\n2. Next, we apply the scientific notation and calculate the volume of seawater. First, convert 2 liters to cubic meters:.2L * 1m3/L =.2m3. Then, convert the cubic meter into cubic centimeters: 1m3/1000m2 = 1m2/1000cm2. Now, we have.2m3/10cm2. Finally, convert cubic centimeter to cubic meters again: 1 cm3 = 1cm2 * 1m2/cm2 = 1m3. Therefore, the final cubic meter is 1. Now, we need to convert 20% into a percentage:.20 L = 20%. Then, multiply 1 L by.20 and we get 0.2 L. Now, we multiply the new volume with the cubic meters again and we get 0,002 L. Next, we want to know how much salt is in each volume. To find the weight per cubic meter of salt, we need to take a look in the periodic table:.0025 kg/L = 0,00025 kg L=.0025 g L. Now we need to multiply the.0025g L with the new 0,004 L volume and we get 0,00001g L. Now we have the amount of salt available per volume 0,001 g per L. We next multiply the.001 g/L of salt with 1 and we get 00001 kg or 0,001 kg. Now, we multiply 0,003 by 0,005 of salt to get 0,015 gram sodium chloride. We need to multiply 0,014", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "The final two people each lost 49 kilograms.\n\n### Rationale:In order to solve this problem, first we need to list the statements in logical order to know what to calculate. The statements in the problem are: \n1.) Four people lost a total of exactly 103 kilos \n2.) 27 kilos was lost by the first person\n3.) The second person lost 20 kilos less than the first person\n4.) The final two people lost 11 kilos each\n5.) The four people lost a total of at least 103 kilgs. \n6.) The four people lost at least 27 kilos. \n7.) The four people lost the same amount, which is not the 27 kilogs lost by the first person. \n8.) The second person lost at least 7 kilograms, which isn't 0, because 0 can't be less than anything. It is also not the 11 kilogs lost by the final two people, because those kilogs must be at least 11. \n9.) Let's find the maximum possible total amount that the final two people can be missing, which is the difference between the total 103 kilogs and the 27 kilgs lost by the first person, which is 76 kilogs. \n10.) Let's define the variable x as the lost amount of one final person, not necessarily the second one. \n11.) Applying the difference of 76 kgs to both possible variables, x and y, it becomes 76/2 since this is a maximum possible loss, gives x = 38 and y = 38.\n12.) Subtracting 27 from 38, the first step is to know that we can only take the smaller number in some place in the problem. In the third sentence, the first person lost 20, so this is a good place for taking the number 7. \n13.) The second step is to subtract 7 in some place in the remaining statement with the last two people lost 19. The number 11 will be a good number to be subtracted. For this problem, the only possible place is the 4. \n14.) We now know what values we need to multiply by to know the", "answer": " 28"}
{"text": "There are 29 slices left.   \n\n### Rationale:\n1. Start with an 10-slice pie and subtract these 10 from the 37 total cookie pies.   \n2. Divide 37 by 24, the number of \"people\" to give pieces of each pie, and you get 1 1/2 pieces each.   \n3. Manny gets 4 pieces from each of 5 pie slices, his classmates get 3 pieces from each 8, and Mr. Keith takes 3 pieces each from 4 pies.  \n4. That leaves 10 pieces for Mr. Keith and 21 pieces for Manny's classmates.  \n5. That means 19 pies are left over. But the entire 37 of pies were to be shared to begin with, so there must be 18 pies plus 18 pieces of excess, 19 pieces total.  \n6. Divide 33 by 24, and you have 1 5/12 pieces each.  \n7.

{"text": "Jeanette started out juggling 20 balls.\n\n### Why?Jeanette's initial juggling number is 3. If she added 2 each week to that number for 5 weeks, her final number would be 25. Since Jeanette is practicing, she might not be quite ready to juggle 25 in one throw, but would be able to juggle 22 in 5 throws, so she would be able to juggled 50 balls. In a similar manner, she would be able to practice another 5 weeks and be ready to throw 53 in one throw. That's the same as 70 balls in total.\n\n### Rationales:1. The question is about Jeanette, who is practicing juggling. The question tells us she is practicing and asks what she can juggle.\n2. To determine how many objects Jeanette could juggle, her initial juggling number should be found.\n3. Based on the question, each week she can juggle a few more objects than the previous week, implying she gains a certain number of objects each week.\n4. In total, Jeanette could gain 25 objects for 5 weeks, or 125 objects in total.\n5. If 25 is used as Jeanette's initial juggle number, 125 would represent the number she can juggle altogether.\n6.

First look at the given information: the question requires a box with specific dimensions that will be placed into a hole with specific dimensions. 2. Next, consider the options provided, A 10 lb box and a 2 ft by 3 ft hole. 3. One can immediately rule out the options of 4 ft by 6 ft and 5 lb box respectively since they are incompatible with the given dimensions and are hence not possible. 4. As the dimensions of the box are not provided, we could not know what length to calculate the box's weight to - 3 ft or 4 ft. 5. Therefore, the best option is A 10 lb and B 2 ft x 3 ft x 6 inch hole. 6. To solve, determine the amount of the box that is not covered by dirt in the hole, which is then multiplied by the amount of dirt. 7. So, the amount of box that is not covered is (2 ft x 3 inches - 4 inches) = 88/12 of a foot. 8. The amount of dirt that is put in the hole is (9 inches - 6 inches) = 3 inches. 9. Then we multiply 88/10 by 3/64 = 8.6 x 5/16 = 8.625. 10. 88/1625 = 0.534. 11. 88/534 is 16.34 seconds.\n\n### Input::In mathematics, what is equal to X if y = y x y is true", "answer": " 6"}

Choices:  A. 2 miles B. 3 miles C. 4 miles D. 25 miles E. 20 miles F. 6 miles\nRationales: There are two things to remember when answering this question:\n1. It is very unlikely that the answer will be between numbers that have the same number of decimal places.\n2. The numbers of each category are ordered from least to greatest, with the smallest category being 1 \ufffd 2, the medium range being 3 \ufffd 4, and the largest category being 20 \ufffd 25 miles.\n3. In this question, the smallest category is 1 \ufffd 3 miles. \n4. However, it is doubtful that the answer would be between two numbers that are the same number of decimal points. In this case, we are looking for a number.\n5. So, A (2 miles) and E (20 miles) could not be the correct answer. \n6. The medium range, category 2, is between 3 \ufffd 5 miles, which would exclude category B, 3 miles.\n7. Category 3, the largest range, is between 20 \ufffd25 miles.

Now we need to add the durations of reading for both Emery and Serena to have an answer that is equal to or greater than 20 days.\n3.

The parking lot is 2/100 of a mile long and the doctor's office was 5/100 of mile away. How many miles did he walk that day? Choices: \nA: 1/5 of a mile B: 1/2 of a mile C: 2/3 of a mile D: 1 mile E: 5/6 of a mile  \nRationales:  1. First, we consider the two distances. First, consider the beach distance: a man walked 22 steps (distance that he walked in a beach). However, we see that parking space is more considerable, so we need to take this into consideration to determine the parking distance. The total distance that he walked is 16 steps in the parking lot, which is 16/100 miles. We can say that walking the parking lot took half of a minute.\n2. So, the beach was 2/10ths of a mile long and by the parking space, the answer is 16/5ths of a mile. But, now we have two different answers, but we can see it is the same. This means that 2/3 and 1 mile are equivalent to 2/10 and 1/5, respectively.\n3. If we take the average of the two distances, he would have walked 46/30 (approximately 1.5) miles that day.\n4.

(we have already used 12x for Amanda's marbles, the K is Katrina)\n\nThis equation means that we have to find the x number that will represent the amount of marbles Katrina has, in other words \"x marbles\". \n\nTherefore, `x = 12 / 2 = 6`, which means that, Amanda already has six more marbles than Katrina.\n\nAgain, Mabel having 85 marbles can be described using another formula: `5 * x = 90`. ( Katrina had 50 marbles previously, and since they're increasing five times, `x marbles` would be \"5*x\". As there is no x already provided in the question. This equation means that to find what Katrina has, we have to factor the 85 marbles with the equation 5x = 90 and obtain 16.5)\n\nTherefore, Mabel has 16.5 more marbles than Kadrina. Now, we must deduct the 6 marbles obtained from Amanda from the 16.5 marbles obtained from Mabel, which gives us 10.5, which is `6 - [16.5 - 6] = 10.5`.\n\nTherefore, Amanda needs 12 marbles more than Katrina for doubling, but has 6 more marbles than Kadina. Therefore, Mabel's number of marbles is 10.5 more than that of Amanda. \nTherefore, the number of marbles that Mabel has is `x + (x - y) = x + (y - y) = x = 10.25`. \n\nTherefore the answer to the question would be `6 + (10.5 - 6) = 6 + [10.5 - (6 + 6)] = 10.75 = 10", "answer": " 63"}

{"text": "Janet hires six full-time employees. The first question asks about the number of employees. There are four warehouse employees and two managers. As there is exactly one warehouse employee per manager, there are in total 6 employees. The next question asks to tell about the warehouse employee's pay. It is $15/hour. For each hour they work, they receive $15. The question then asks whether it is only the managers that are making $20/hour? It is not clear if the answer to this question is yes or no, and the answer is \"yes\" for ease of understanding. It is, however, true. The question then asks how many people work 25 days a week, and how many hours a day each person works. There are four wage employees working 25 days a months, each working 8 hours a day. The question is to now tell the wages and FICA taxes that Janet has to pay. Now, the question asks how much does Janet have to pay total for one month. There are six employees who each work 25 days and receive wages and FICAT taxes. Therefore, the pay total for all six employees is $370. Therefore, one month adds up to $370x6x10%, or $1,428 for FICA taxes, bringing us to a grand total of $5,128 for Janet.\n\n### Input\nI have a number that's equal to one-fourth of one-fifth of one-quarter.

Then, the original equation is equivalent to 2 x/3 x/5, which is equivalent to 2(3x)/5. Simplifying on the left, we have 4 x/5 = 4x/25. Finally, the original number x must be equal to x/25.

{"text": "The answer is 6 minutes.\n1. We start by finding all the constraints in the problem. Let i=1...n which represent 1 to 12. The constraint in the first part of the question is, most of her patients require standard  care, which accounts exactly for (i\u22123)/4 or 31/4 of her patients. The constraint in the second part of the question is the ratio of standard care patients to all patients, which accounts to  (i\u22123)/(i\u22123\u2212 31/4), so 4/5 of all patients. Thus we can write this ratio as 4/5 or 16 over 21 and simplify it to a fraction of 2/3. Therefore the constraint i>1= the remaining 22/3 of patients or approximately 66/3.\n2. We can write the constraints i.e. the requirement of n patients for standard care and the ratio of standard care to all as inequalities, which we can express as the inequality \u2018a > b\u2019 where a and b are all the variables we have chosen previously i.e. 1..n.\nThe inequality now can be represented as n < 7.\n\n3. The question now states that Missy has to take to the patient\u2019s dinner, where every patient will take 5 minutes, which means that total time of serving patients takes 5(i-3).

The solution now is to find when does the total time become 6 minutes, where 1..6 is the variable set for representing the total time.\n5. The inequality now has to be represented as total time = 6, which can be written as 5(i-9) which can be simplified to 5(i \u22121) as i.e. i \u22129 has the value of zero. Therefore,\ntotal time = 5* (i -1), which can be simplified as 5*i.\n6. Therefore the answer now is 5 times the total number of standard care patients. Thus total number of standard care = 5*i, which makes total number of all the patients = 5 * 5(i-1), while the total time =", "answer": " 64"}

We should consider the definitions of fruit and vegetables before deciding.\n4. Fruit is generally defined as the edible, fertilized seed or its ovaries.  And vegetables are generally any of numerous and mostly edible plant foods that have a root, stem, leaf, and seed.  As we can see, a plant is required for either one to grow.\n5. From this, both fruits and vegetables are grown from plants.\n6. Therefore the answer must be option C or D, a tree or plant.  Plants, and trees in particular, can be found by having patience.\n7. There is the option of eggs as well.\n8. However, eggs are not grown from plants as they are actually made by a chicken or another type of bird that is a separate from a plant.  Also, egg production is a very active process and not one that necessarily requires patience.\n9. The other options are ruled out by this analysis.\n10. We then choose option D, plants, as they grow from the best parent plant, a tree.\n11. After that, we can find the fruit and vegetables within that plant.\n12.

Next, John consumes 2112.5 mg of caffeine from his energy drinks and an additional 1037.5 mg from pill making the sum of his total caffeine intake as total 3150 mg. The total amount of caffeines consumed by John is 3150/2215=1.42 or rounds 1.42. Therefore, the total caffeine consumption for John is 14200 mg.\n\n### Rationale:\nFirst, we need to determine how much caffeine is in each drink and the number of beverages consumed. The beverages are 2 32-ounce drinks with a 250 grms of caffeine each. And a 350mg caffeine pill. The total intake of caffeine is 6750 mg. So, to find the number of mg with the same amount of caffeic acid as 8368 mg. Since in energy drinks, the drinks are 12-ounce bottles. The 12-ounce of energy drink = 20 ounces. So, the drinks will have 4 ounces and total mg will be 4000mg. The 30-ounce will have 6.666 which is.6 ounces. The total 1571.6mg. So, the amount of caffein is 8620 mg.

The right amount of confidence is present.\nRationales:\n1. \"How can I\" - This implies that there are multiple ways to tell if a person is adept at prediction.\n2. The word, \"person\" - Generally, a person is not a thing that you can test and come up with a definitive answer about their abilities.\n3.

Thus, in this scenario, I need to identify how many bags I can sell in order to be able to sell 15% of them. \n\n3. I calculate the quantity of bags I can sell by multiplying the number of bags I can potentially sell by 15%. For 5 bags, this is 5 x (15 / 100) x 100%. Thus, the quantity I need to sell to be able to sell a 15% of the bags is 5.\n\n4. I multiply the $3000 (base) by the percent of 5 (quantity) as 5 x $3000 = $15000, which confirms the 15% I want to sell at a profit costs $450.\n\n5. The answer is $450. 450/100 = 4.5. \n\n6.

First, understand that the questions asks for the number of people who play football out of a sample of 250.\n2. Next, we need to set up the number of people who like football out of 250 which is 50.\n\n3. For the sake of explanation, let's consider n=250 and p=50 for our sample size and like football population respectively. \n\n4. Now, there are 4 possibilities or outcomes, n>p=n>50 (41.5 percent), n\u2264p=n\u226450 (11.5%), n<p=n<50 (23.5 percent), and n=p=n=50%  which means there's a 41.5% of there's more people who play football than those who like football and a 11.5% chance that there isn't anyone who plays football or not like football.  There's also 23.5% chance that both are true. \n\n5. Since, there is a 11. 5% chance of the probability distribution, we'll exclude these outcomes from the options. \n6. Consider the remaining 2 outcomes of possibilities.  \n7. n>50 is the case when the sample size is more than the like football population.\n8. From the two sample sizes, n>50 and n=50 is highly unlikely since the population for both is the same (50%), so we'll be eliminating that 2 options as well. \n9. For n<50, we only need to consider the 21 percentage points of n<50 since the case for 50% will be eliminated soon as well so we only need to consider n<50.\n10. Let's consider n=50 and n=49 first, if they were to be true, then the population for playing football and liking football are 50 and 50% respectively. \n11. From this, we can easily see that the total n% of playing football=n% of liking football+n% of disliking football which is 125 %-10", "answer": " 50"}

What does this mean?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput:  \"You can't see your nose from the inside\"  Means that, unlike the moon, you can always see your nose?\nRationales:\n1. The question is based on the statement \"You can't tell the truth from the inside when it is on the inside.\"\n2. The sentence is asking to find out the meaning of the phrase which contains the sentence \"You can't know the truth from the inside while it is on the inside\"\n3. The meaning is that you can't tell the fact from the inside when it resides inside, \n4. Review the given options, \"You can't always see your nose from the outside\" makes sense.\n5. That means sometimes we can't see our nose because it is inside our head that is we can't see it from outside.\n6. Other options like, \"The moon isn't on the moon\", and \"the moon is always on the surface while it's on the side\" does not makes much sense.\n7. Therefore the best-suited answer is \"you can't always see the nose from outside\"\n8. Another option \"Nose is part of Moon \" which does not makes much sense too.\n9.

{"text": "I need to eat a little more than half of what she did for the last two days. So, 9 cups.\n\n### Rationale: The correct answer is E. Her 8 cups of vegetables is just half her 16 cups daily recommendation. She needs at least 16-16=9 cups per day to meet her daily minumum requirements for the week.\n\n### Note: If we count only her 4 cups of vegetables on Saturday, (8 cups-4 cups=4 cups) and then subtract an additional 4 cups from that 4 cups, we get an answer of 9 cups (9 cups-4 cu=5 cups), which matches the answer option that is 9 cups.  \n\n### Note 2: Another possible response strategy for this math problem is instead of trying to work out the equivalent daily amounts of vegetables, just subtract the total of the answer option from the sum total.\n\n### Input : What is the temperature at 2:30 pm in Phoenix, Arizona in this graph?\n\n### Rationales: The temperature at 2:15 pm is 112\u00b0F, and the temperature at 2 pm is 110\u2070F. So, the temperature at 2pm is 2\u2070F more than at 112pm. \n\n### The temperature at 3:00 pm is calculated in the same way using the temperature at 2 and 3 pm.\n\n### The calculation result for 3\u00b0pm is 112\u00b9\u2070F \u2013 110\u2070=2\u2070F=2\u00b0F.\n\n### Therefore, the temperature at 3pm is 122\u00b2F, which is the option for 3 pm.\nAnswer: C. The temperature at 3pm.\n\n### Solution method: As the given graph does not include data for times equal to or before 12pm, the solution requires us to make logical assumptions about the temperature at those times.\n\n### Since the data does not mention the temperature at 12pm or before, the temperature at those times can be assumed to be the same value as at 2:35 pm.\n\n## Alternate Solution: There was no data about the temperature at 11:4", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "Option 1: Jack is 50% more likely to catch either malaria or Zika virus.\n### Demonstation:\n\nTo figure out how Jack's percentage changes when he takes the malaria vaccine, we need to calculate these two percentages: The percentage of mosquitos infected with malaria in Jack's area is 0.4, and 0.2 is the percentage of mosquitos that are infected with ZIKA. Since a random mosquito has 50% chance of infecting him either with malaria or ZIKA virus, our answer key should be 0.5. Now that we know what the answer is, it's time to find out how much of a change it is. Because we know the percentage chance of getting both malaria and ZIKA is 0.5, we can subtract the malaria vaccines 0.5 to get to the probability of one of the viruses.

{"text": "It took the border collie 78 seconds to catch up to the thrown ball.\n\n### Rationales:\n1.  To find how many seconds it took the border collie to reach the ball, we must use the formula 5f/20 = x.\n2. For x to equal 8, x = 8 = 5(4) = 5(2) = 5*2 = 10 seconds.\n3. Now we see that it took the border dog ten whole seconds to run 50 (20 x 5 = 5 x 2= 20) feet to catch up to the the ball. Since it took the dog ten whole seconds to travel 50 feet, it took the dog 5 seconds to travel 30 feet and another five seconds to travel the remaining 20 feet. Therefore, the border collie took a total of ten seconds to travel 5x2= 10 x 5 =55 feet at a rate of 5 feet/second.\n4. Substituting in for d (deceleration rate in seconds/second=1/10) into the formula we found above to be x = 8, we get 8 = 40(d)/d = 50(d)/d, which simplifies to 50(d) - 40d = 50 (99.89) = 49.9(99.89- 1) = 49(99.61) = 4,636.5 = 4,664 = 4674.\n5.

He also gets 25 apples which are sour apples and would earn a profit of 25. So the total profit he would make if he sold all his 100 and 25 apples respectively, would be $100 and $25 respectively. So the total profit earned by him, in this case, would be $75.\n\nNow since he can't sell all his apples, there is a loss of $25 as he sold all his sweet apples and could not make money. So the apples he would earn would be his sold apples $75.\nAnswer: $75\n\n### Demand:\n1. The demand is how much the item will be sold at, not how much the item is worth. \n2. It can be either at or above the price offered. \n3. For example, if someone were to sell all their stocks, they would have a demand of $0 per stock.

The question is about which emotion Alice might feel after going to the doctor.\n2. The most common emotion that a patient feels when visiting the doctor is confusion.\n3. The confusion can stem from a combination of questions, concerns, and a desire to understand what is happening to them.\n4. Afterwards, the confusion may cause the patient to feel anxious, resulting in a general feeling of unease and uneasiness.\n5. The other choices offered - relaxed, sick, depressed, annoyed - are less likely to be experienced immediately after visiting the doctor.\n6. For example, being relaxed would likely have to be a result of overcoming the initial feeling of sadness and grief due to a sickness or depressed before feeling relaxed.\n7. Also, being annoyed can be considered an extreme reaction to visiting the doctor, and it's less likely to be the natural reaction of going to the doctor. \n8.

{"text": "Based on the given question, it is clear that Ivan needs to refill his bird feeder every week, where two cups of bird seed can feed 14 birds\n\n### A: Ivan\u2019s bird feeds feed 14 birds, so Ivan feeds 14 birds every week at the feeder that can feed two birds per cup.\n### B: Because Ivan\u2019s birdseed can feed four birds per cup, that means that Ivan\u2019s bird feed feeds fourteen birds per week.\n### C: A hungry squirrel is taking half a cup of bird seed from Ivan\u2019s feed every week. However, the question does not mention what happens after the squirrel eats the bird seed, so it is not entirely accurate to compare.\n### D: Ivan\u2019s bird feed can feed four birds per half cup due to how it is designed. This is equivalent to feeding sixteen birds per week. If half a cup of birdseeds are stolen by the squirrel, Ivan is losing around eighteen birds by the end of the week. \n### E: Ivan\u2019s birdseed feeds 28 birds per week. This is because both cups are full by the end of the feeder and each cup can feed fourteen birds.\n### Ivan's bird feeder feeds 4 birds per half a cup and can feed 2 cups of birdsseed. Thus, it must feed around 4 birds per half-cup and two whole cups. This means that it can feed 14/2 = 7 birds every week. \n\nInput: How much time did it take for Mary to write this math problem?

The first step in applying the decimal form, 2040, to the fraction form, 0.9, is to multiply the two. This gives me the product 18. \n\n2. The next step is to divide the answer obtained by the original fraction's denominator. This gives me the decimal representation of the fraction.\n3.

{"text": "$10.00\n\n### Response Explanation:\nDuring the process of solving the problem, remember that the key is understanding the question. Then, we can go through the options and eliminate the choices that are not correct. The goal is to narrow down the options for a final answer.\n-First, the question is saying that he buys the items every Sunday. From this, we know he buys items at a bakery. This narrows down the options from anywhere else in the world.\n-Next, we have to understand how much Sean spends on each item and how many of each he buys. From the last line of the question, we can see that he buys 2 lattes which costs $2.5 per one. The next line tells us he buys a loaf of foccacia at $4. So, he buys 2 foccacia loaves at $8.\n-The next part is finding the total cost of the items he buys.\n-The next step is to determine the total number of items and their prices he buys. For example, 2 foccacia, 2 lattes. The overall cost comes up to $8 and $4.75, or $13.75\n-After finding the total number of items bought, add the prices of the items, and you will find the total cost of Sean's Sunday groceries.\n\n### Response 2\n\n### Instructions:\nIn the diagram, the letter on the left side of the dotted line is to the right of the letter on the right side of the line.

{"text": "The answer depends on whether or not some of the students who chose to learn through home are present in school on the day of choice.\n1. If some of the students who selected to learn through home decided to be physically present in school, their count would replace the same count chosen to study from home, thus the students left would be twice the total percent.\n2. This is because the group who chose to learn from home would have reduced by an equal number to the group who chose to be physically present, and thus there would be an equal number of students per group.\n3. However, if only some of the students who elected to study through home actually were physically present in school on that day, their count would replace that of the remaining students chosen to be present physically in school.\n4. This is because as some of the students who had elected to study through home were physically present in the school, the reduced group would then mean that only half the students are present.\n5. Therefore, if some of the students who were chosen to study through home on that day were physically present in schools, their count would replace their equivalent count from the second group, and the other would be only half of the original count.\n6. If, however, some of the students who learned through home were absent on the day they chose to be present in school, their equivalent count from the group who chose to study remotely would not change at all.\n7.

He threw the third throw 150m more than the first throw.\n  In summary: 1st throw: 1050-1050 = 0, 2nd throw: 1040-1040 = 0, and 3rd throw: 1035-1035 = 0.\n  We can conclude that he's throwing distances such that the first throw is twice the second throw and one half the third throw, and the total sum is 1050 - 0 = 1050, which is a validity check.\n3. We can see that this question could work based on how he threw the javelines on the second and third throws, so we don't need to consider the first throw.\n4. Since there are three variables, we can use the formula A+B=C in this case, and solve for the first throw distance. Since C=1050, our problem statement could be translated to A-B= 1050\n5. This question can be solved using the variable x. I'll multiply x by the product of 2 and -5/2.\n  This can be solved through the multiplication method.\n  1. 1050 = A-B\n  2. x * 2 x  (1/(1-2))\n6. We know that x=throw distance on first throw since we know that A=throw distance on third throw since this is the total amount, and B=throw distance on second throw.\n7. Now let's plug in the values:\n  1. x * 2 = A-B", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "54\n\n### Rationales:\nYou have some extra information here since the question is asking about the number of birds still in the cage after ten minutes. \n\nThe first step in solving this task is defining the terms.\n\n1. The \"grey\" birds refers to an undefined species of bird that is being distinguished by its color.\n2. The \"white\" birds are not any specified species of bird just because they are white.\n3. All the birds in the cages are called \"birds\" in the question with no further specification.\n4. The \"birds...\" are referring to a group of animals that can fly which, in this case, could be called birds, and the \"...in the cage\" are animals that cannot fly, which the question suggests to be referred to as animals because of the second-last sentence of the question, asking to calculate the total number of animals left, which they are birds as well.\n\nNow that you have some basic concepts to work with:\n\n1. There are six more white birds than greybirds in the cage.\n2. The overall number of birds in the cage (the total number of living birds in the cage) is 40 birds.\n3. After ten minutes, half of those birds are freed and fly, leaving only half of the number of birds (20 birds) in the cage. Since six of the 20 remaining birds are white birds, there remain five white birds in the cage after all the flight.\n\nThe question therefore requires us to calculate the total number five white birds left in the cage after the flight. \n\nHere is what's happening:\n\n1. Consider, when there are six more white birds (total number 6) than grey birds (total number 40), which implies that the total number of white birds (total number of 6) will be the same as the total number of grey birds (total number of  46). \n2. Now, after the flight and after half of the birds in total (20) are freed (total number of 40), there will be no white birds left (total number of 0), and as we don't know how many grey birds flew, but we know that there were fifty grey birds in the cages (total number of 50), which leaves fifty-five", "answer": " 66"}

This number divided by 100 gives us that the total ants in the ant farms are the unit fraction (1 / 1). \nIn order to find out how many male ants Stephen has, use the following formula: (110 - 55) / 2. This gives us that Stephen has (110 - (55 x 10%)). \nIf we subtract the number 55 and multiply by the %  to get out that Stephen has  (110 - ((55 / 100)) x 10%).   \nSince 55 cancels out, we have (110 -.55) x 10%. This number is equal to 55% of the total number of male worker ants.\n\n### Response to Instructions:\nSince (110 -.55) x 0.10/0.2  = .25x10 = 100\n\n### Response Answer : \nIn order to calculate how many females Stephen has, we must take the total amount of ants in the ant fain (110). Then we multiply by the total number of males and add to the total amount of an the male ants:    55.", "answer": " 44"}

{"text": "Susannah went swimming 3 times more weeks a week than Camden.\n\n### Rationale:The number of times they went can be divided equal for 4 weeks.  \nSusannah went more than 3 times but it is not directly stated, therefore, it is inferred.\n\n### Input:\"Britain and France are ______ with ______ when speaking.\"\n\n### Response:\"Britain and French are in contact with each other when speaking\"\n\n### Rationales: 1.\"Britain and France\" are two locations.  \n2.When speaking, we are referring to conversation.  \n3.The question is requesting the meaning of Britain and France.\n\n### Question:\n\n>How many times do you think you should have the same friend on your team?  \n>Let's say that at least five people are friends, but you're only two are close friends.  \n>What are the chances of two of your friends meeting again someday in the future?\n\n### Demostration:\nWe already know that the minimum of people in the group is five friends. Also, two people can be friends. Then, the number of choices can be reduced.\n\n### The answer should be:\n\n>Let's assume that two of the friends are close friends.   >So they are not in the group, because there can be at most one in the group of five friends. We need to take into account that the two have met with one of which is close, which means there are three chances of meeting again.\n\n### If you only need the information, use the following:\n\nInput:How are the United States and Italy different from one another?\n\nRationale:The question is asking about the differences between these two places. First, we need to consider what it could mean to be united to one another. If two countries are united to one another, they have a certain relationship or are connected. This relationship may be very close.  \nNow let us look at the options. \"unified\" means \"allied\" or \"joined\" with one another while \"separated\" means that there is some kind of barrier between them.  \nThe other options, \"alike\" and \"different,\" are describing two different things. \"Alike\"", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "$115\n\n### Demostration:\n\n1. The first step to solving this question is understanding the equation provided:\nx = 63 + 9 + 10\n2. From this equation, we can calculate the following:\nx = 82\n3. Next, apply the cost per hour for each job:\nmowing (63*6 = $378) + pulling weeds (9*11 = $99) + putting down mulch (10*9 = $90) = $0\n4. We also need to subtract the costs of a job from the hours worked and add in the hours worked on each job to calculate hourly pay:\n(63*6)=$378 + (9*11)=$99 + (10*9)=$90 =($0)\n5.

Option T: taller, refers to the piles if they are taller relative to each other, it will be the answer choice.\n  2. Option B: higher would imply the piles are taller than the other stacks and relative to other piles. It's not the answer but can be eliminated. 3. Option C: longer, it's not directly applicable and can be eliminated. If the number of blocks in each pile was equal then  T was the only answer choice relevant.\n 4. Option D: smaller would imply the piles would be shorter relative to the other stacks and can also be eliminated. 5.

{"text": "Lydia has a pool that holds 60 gallon of water, but the pool leaks water at a small amount of 0.1gallon per minute. She uses 1.6 gallon per minute hose to fill the pool. How long will her pool be filled. Lydia needs to find how much time it will take to completely fill her pool. \n\nTo Solve: First write all the available information. In our case, \n   1. 60 gallon = 60/231 (1 gallon = 231 cubic inch) = 0.255714 * 42 ( a gallon = 42 quart)  = 10.89 litre,\n   2. 60 gallons = 60 * 8 (1 gallon is 1 liter ),\n   3. 1.6 gall/min = 1.6 * 0.5 (1 min = 0.5 galon),\n   4. 0.1g per minute.\nThe first part is done for us by having a pool for dogs.  We can convert into liters. \nFirst convert to gallon. The pool has 10.8 gallon. Convert back to liters. \n   60 gallon = (10.8 * 0.5), rounding up. 60 gall is only 1.6  litre, only 15 litre is enough. \n    4. 15 liter * (1 gall / 0.231 cubic inches = 1 liter= 0.257)  \n    => 15 * 42 = 630. 630 liters * 1.6 gall = 1036\n    \nNow we have to fill that 1036 litre into a 60 gallon pool.  This means we have to divide 630 in 60, 1036/ 60 = 17.8 min, 17.8 * 60 seconds per minute = 1094 second, 1094 sec * 60 min = 64610 seconds = 646 min which is 42 hours, 4", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "> Let H represent the total amount of history books. L represent the amount of romance books, and M represent the poetry books.\nWe know that Nancy shelved the total amount of H, L, and M when she was done, but we need to find out the total amount of L and M before she shelved them. So, first let:\n\nH = 12, L = N + 1, and M = N - L.\n\nWe know that the total number of books is given to us, and we can't subtract from it without using the work done condition. We can see that H + L = N and add two, H + L + 2 = N + 2.\n\nLet V represent the total number of books on the shelf.\n\nWe can now use the given information to solve for V. V = N + 2 - M = N + 2 + 2(N - M) = N + 2 (N - M). Since there are M books of a different type, and we know that the total number L is the total number of books, L = N + M, we can rewrite our equation to find the total number of books. V = N + N + 2(N + M) =N + 2N + 2M = 2N + 3M. This is because of the given information.\n\nThus, we can solve our equation, making the total of books Nancy shelves equal 0.\n\nLet this mean V = 0 and we can solve the equation 0 = N + 2N + M \n\n0 = 2N + M, or M = -1\n\nHowever, we have yet to use the second type of work done, so our final answer doesn't need all the work done equations, just the final answer. N = 12 since the first number is given and we don't use the final answer equation. We can then get M = -1 and use that in our first equation to solve for N. H = 12 - 1, L = 13, and M = -1. Nancy can then be finished with V = 12 + (-1) + 13 = 12 + -10 + 13 =3, because there were 3 books left to shelve.\n\n### Hints:", "answer": " 46"}

I do not know a teacher, a tutor, or a professor that would not tell someone who is absent to make up the missed classwork upon their return. A second point is that I know that classmates sometimes do not go to the class they are in. This is an example of the classmate saying that they are in a class while at work or if they do not feel like going to class. I believe the original task was to answer an example from the test, not to tell why someone's score doesn't matter or why they got it answered.

You put two quarters on the table and he chooses to play first.  The game requires that his opponent put in two quarters and he puts in one. If he puts one quarter in twice, he gets 2 quarters back.  The game goes 1, 2.  Next the opponent must put in two quarters.  The player could choose to get one quarter.  If she chooses to try and steal one more quarter, her opponent chooses to play one game and if he steals then he needs to put two quarters and receive two more quarters. The game continues 1, 3, 5; 1, 4 and 7.  If the player puts in his 2 quarters, the game ends 1, 4; but you need 2, 3.  So the outcome is 1, 4, 7; he cannot win all of the quarters.  If he puts two in once, then the other player does the same and his outcome is 1,2,3.  If the player tries one game and it wins 1, 2 the opponent does 2, 3 and then wins 1, 8.  It is still a tie because 2, 3 is also a tie because it won the same game.

{"text": "### Demo:\nThe instruction tells me how to answer the question, but it gives me no way to do so. The answer is  that he needs 110 kilograms of produce every 6 months, but I have no way to get there. I'm lost.\n\n\n#### Demo:\nThe instruction I have is, \"How many grapes does Borris need in a year after producing more?\" I have no information about how many grapes he is already producing.\n\n\n\n#### Demo-2:\nIf I assume that every six months he produces 90kg of grapes, then I can use six times 190 kg = 1100kg for the new total.\n\n\nThe answer above is incorrect-110kg is not greater than 90kg, but I think that is what was intended. I don't have enough information to find 110kg.\n\n### Demo-3:\nOk. Now the instruction says it again. How many grap? OK, I see Borris needs 110kg each 6 months. What was the old amount? That must have been 90kg. Now his production needs to be 110kg/6 (for 6 months) and 110kg+90kg=200kg each 6 month period. And he had a total of 90kg to fill those two quarters as well. And now he wants to produce 20% more, so 20% of 200 kgs is 40kg more. Each quarter he will make that 40kg increase in addition to what he already made, for 80kg during each quarter. After 3 quarters he will have the increase needed, and a total of 208kg that year, which is what I calculated before.\n\n\n\n### Demo 4:\nOk,  I see what I was missing. It wasn't just how big Borris's production  needed to be. I also had to calculate the quarterly increases.\n\nIt is easier to simply say that this task is not clear.\n\n### Comments?\n\n### How does this task help us to learn the task of answering questions? \n\n# Exercise 1.4.4", "answer": " 216"}

How is that possible?\"\n\n### Response:\"\nAsk him to think of 70% as a fraction (because it is) and 70%(in this case it would most likely be between 70 and 79%) is equal to 70/100=0.7, and because it doesn't work with whole numbers you divide the whole percent by 10= 0.7\n\n### Solution for grader and explanation:Pablo could use a bit more help. A 70% is 0.7, so the average grade he needs to get to keep his grade is 70/70 =1 or B.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "Let x be the total number of baloons in the hot air ballon, we have to find x/5 and then 2x.  Since 2x is twice the number of baloons that already blown, 2x = 2x/5. Since 2x is the whole number, it is not equal to a 1/5 or a rounded 1/5. we have 2(x's) = x. We put x's= x/5+1, so 2(x'/(5)+1) = 2x. We plug in the value of x into the equation, (2x) / (5)+1 = 2x. Since 2x has to be an integer, we have to divide (2x) in 2x, since 2x is an integer, so (2x)/2 = x. Putting (2x)/2 back into (2x)/5+1 = x, we find out the total number of balanons, so (2x/5*2) + 1 = x. We find x, x+1 = 2x/4x. Now we plug in x and x+1 into our equation, and we get 2x/(4x) + 8 = (2x+1)/((4x*2)). Now we have a fractional value left, (2x+1) (4x*2)/(4x = x+1 = (4x*2)x/(4x)4x. After that we have a regular fractional value, (4x)(x/1)((x+1)/1) = (4x)(x). We simplify further and we have x + 2x = 4x. Finally we simplify and we get x = 4x-2x = 2 x. \n\n### Input : Write an algorithm which takes two natural number and doubles them.\n\n### Expected Demonstration:Write the name, and input and output of the function.\n\n### Solution:\n#### Name:Double\n#### Input:A natural number\n#### Output: twice the input.\n\n#### Algorithm:\ndef double(number): \nnumber = number * 2\nreturn number\n\n### Input:-1\n### Output:-2\n### Expected Solution:\nInput of", "answer": " 80"}

This leaves the other half to be equal to $.50. So, Tom would have to purchase $500 (half) of the bricks. He will have spent a total of $.50 plus $500 totalling $550.", "answer": " 375"}

{"text": "It will take six trips for Caleb andCynthia to fill their pool with their buckets with water.\n\n#### Explanation:The first step is to determine how much water Cynthia adds with each trip.\n\nIn the first trip, Cynthia adds eight gallons in each trip so that in 105 trips it will take her to add 8*105=(800) gallons in one trip.\n\nSo, in the case, it will take one trip to fill up to half of the pool with water.\n\nThen, in a second trip, Caleb will add to Cynthia to half of the pool. Cynthia will continue adding half of the pool in every trip.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that it will take six trips to complete filling up the pool.\n\n#### Output: It will take 6 trips to fill the pool with the buckets.\n\n### Input (Task): Caleb and Cathy are filling up their inflatible pool with water using bucklets. They fill it in the spigit and take the buckets to thier pool. Caleb fills up seven gallons from the bucket and Cathy fills up eight from her bucket. Caleb and Cory fill the pool with 105 gallon water. How many trips did it take for the two of them to fill the pool with 30 gallon water in buckets.\n\n#### Exaplanation: To solve this task, I will first find how many trips are needed to fill up the pool with 32 gallons. Then, I will subtract the total of the trips needed to fill the pool with full water from it. To answer the question, I will use the above equation to solve for `t`.\n\nThe answer is `t=6` because 32 is not evenly divisible by 5 so there are six remaining trips.\n\n#### Expalnation: To solve this example, I will first find a way I could fill up the pool in a timely manner. I found that I could fill up the first half of the pool in 3 trips and the other half in 2 trips. Then I wrote an equation to relate all the solutions.\n\nThis equation is `3 trips + 3 trips", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "We will firstly, find out how may employees take public transportation in a way shown below. Then we will find what percent of all employees take public transportaian and calculate how many more drive to work. Next, we will do the reverse to find out how many more drive.  \nHow many employees take public transportation: 50/100 =.50 x 200= 100. So far, we have 30% take public transportation. Now, we divide 30% from the whole, which gives 15%. Since 100/150 is 0.66 repeat twice to get 120% We have 130%/200 = 0.65 x 200 = 130. So finally, we have 100/ 130=0.7 or 70%.\n\nNow, here's how we find how may more people drive to work.\n\nWe will multiply.7 x 200 to get 140.

{"text": "Mckenna stays at work for 22 hours.\n\n### Justification:\nWe can use the 24 hour clock to determine how many hours McKenna stayed at work. Since we are asked to determine the hours of work at a specific time we will be using the 24 hour methodology, for the number of time she stays at work we use the formula, `H=D/24*T`, and the variables given in the problem are;\n`H: number of hours stay at work`,\n`D: hours of work`,\n`T: time of day`\n\nFrom the given information we have;\n\n`H=D/20*T`\n\n`H=8/24*T`\n\nNow we substitue the 24 hour `H` with a decimal; 0,5\n\n`8/24*H=7 `\n\n`5/3=0,5`\n\n5 hours\n\n### Discussion:\nThe above code should correctly answer the question because the time has been expressed using a 24 hour clock. To determine the answer on our own we would ask how many hours do McKenna stay at work from 8:00 am when she starts working up to 13.00 pm when she finishes her day of work? The answer using the 12 hour time clock is 15 hours or 24,5 hours if expressed in 24 hour time. If we use the 24 clock to express her time we get to a 5 hour difference (5 hours less than 24,5) which is why the answer will by 5 hours.\n\n## Exercise 1.2:\nIn the task below, describe how you would determine how many hours a person stays at work depending on the starting and finishing times expressed using the 24-hour clock.

Now you are going to need to use algebra, that is multiply to the number of all the students by the percentages. This will need to be done twice, once for all of a class of students and then for it's class's students so that the whole percent works out. Now you will need to find how many are out of 40% or in percentage, after that you will need to divide your answer by the percent to get the value of how many students are actually left with the percentage still being applied.

For students in 6th, 7th, and 8th grades, the team consists of 5 students. Students in 9th grade and 10th grade go as singles. They all have to go at the same time, but you can have teams for each grade. Each student, as long as their grade meets the requirements, can go on two teams. (Some teams do not need to go, as all students can commute to school in the same classroom, such as the 3rd grade, 4th grade, and the 5th grade, but the requirements and the number of team members must still be the same.) The students started to go at once. Each team and student was given a map showing the nearest subway station and the time they would arrive there. They all went, but the team of Grade 7s did not know how to use the map, so they called a friend who works in the office of Subway Station. They started to communicate on the phone and had no difficulty in this. Each student spent a certain amount of time on the phone. After half an hour, each started to arrive at the station one after the other. The students in 3rd, 4th and 5th grades arrived on the same station within 10 minutes. The 6th graders were waiting for the 7th graders at the station. The team of grade 6s waited on the station for more than an hour. The team of grade7 waited the whole time.

When the user enters a string of text, the function will return the string as a character array. We then know there are 2 functions we can use to display this received text on the screen. These 2 functions are also used to save and retrieve variables so I will use them to get the numbers, convert them, and print them on the screen. First, we will use the function.\n\nThe function will call the function \"split\" to create a variable of split which is stored in \"words\". Then the variable of variables \"i\" will be stored in \"n.\"\nInput:Input the student names A through F.\n\nThe function is calling \"split\" to create many variables. These variables were created to get a certain amount of information in a string and then pass that information into the rest of the program. The first name of every student will be saved into a string called \"first name.\" Their last names will be saved in a string called \"last name.\" The rest of their information (their numbers) will be saved in their own variable called \"number\" which is within a string called the \"names array.\" These are two different ways of making a string but will look similar because they will both be two separate variables that share the same information.\n\nThe user will input their names and then print them to the screen.\nThe function will first split the names into 2 arrays with a variable of variable \"i = 0\" to define what array it needs to print first. If \"i\" is less than 4, the name of the first student will need to print. If it is more than 4, the program will print the number for that name instead to show the students who have not registered.\n\nWhen all the students", "answer": " 1210"}

{"text": "The grid consists of 10 rows, and 15 squares each row, so all in all, its 150 squares. The grid is colored into 4 rows of 10 and 6 other rows, so the rows of 6 can be referred to as \"middle\". So if the grid is colored, we assume that Marla started from the bottom and went up, then she's colored 66 blue, and then she colored the rest green. If we refer to the bottom 2 rows, then the sum of 4 of it would be 24 and the rest of it which is 66 would be 90.

After 2 hours, the price is $2.00 per person. After 23 hours, the price is still $1.50 per person. What is the cost of the first hour?\n\n### Demostration\n\nThis was a tricky one because of the second to last question. But if I ignore that I can take out the x^2 in the middle.\n\nTo figure out the first question for x we are starting with $24-2*x. We need x. So we put the total number of hours minus two hours into x. Then we say $x=24-2*2. For that last part, we put the x (two hours) in for 2. I'm not sure if it says to put $1.50 because $24-2*$4 is correct so i did it that way but if that is wrong then just put $24-2x.\n\nWe divided $24-2*.5 by to get it. The first answer is $12 but I have $ x-2 is $12 so I take away two because I started with $24-x =$12\n\nLastly, we subtract $12 to get our answer of $0\n\n### Input Hint\n\nI believe that this would be more easier to have the first question be a whole number. The reason why is because then we could just look at the fraction as a decimal to figure out what x=\n\n### Input Solution\n\nFirst we start with the number 24. When you get to x, the last part of that equation x=2.5. Now we have a number that we can divide and we get our answer of $8.75. Now $8.75 is not correct but a little work could do. Now in order to get $8.75 we have to take $2.4 to get $10.15. Now we have to subtract our number and our answer will be $10.175 but $10.12 is our answer so we", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "The answer is how many times the number of apples in Jack's basket (which is 12 at the moment since the basket is full) fit into Jill' problem the other which was x^2 - 12x + 20.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIf we consider x = number of apples in the basket, then Jill has 2x many apples to fill her basket. \n\nIt can hold as much as x (when x = number of appletas in Jill's basket) + 2x (when x = maximum number of apples in Jill's bucket at this moment which is 12 right now)\n\nSince 2x > x then the answer would be x is: (Number of apples in Jills basket when she has the full amount of apples) = 12 (this is her maximum number of apples and currently her basket is filled and she cant put any more apples)\nTherefore 2x = number of apples + x (this is the equation that will make sense for the solution)\nSolution (the value of x in the equation):\n2x will always be bigger than 12 - in other words\nyou can always put two times more apples in Jill bucket then the maximum amount of apples in Jilling's bucket so x (the number of apples in her bucket) is equal to the number of apples she currently has.\n\nI got this a answere from Reddit:\n\\", "answer": " 3"}

If the same truck, traveling at half the speed, must clear the bridge by a height of 2 meters, how fast does it need to be going? _____________________________ \n___________ \nAns: _____________________________ 18.35 m /min\n\n### Input__: You can complete the proof by showing that: There are exactly three integers that are four greater than four greater than 140. How might you prove this is true? ______________________________ Proof: If you look at the sum, you\u2019ll find that you can write it as: 140+ 3(5) = 140 + 15 = 155. Therefore, there is exactly one integer that is greater than the sum. But if you add it together, you find that the answer is exactly 2 greater than the given sum. Therefore, there are exactly 3 integers that are 4 greater than the given sum which means that the integers are: 151, 152 and 153 (within the range).\n\n\n### Input___: To show the students how to work with variables, you could ask them to write a statement using only the values of the letters w, x, and h.

She asked her mom how. One way was to shade the whole square. She shaded part of the square and found out that  the area of the shaded part is 36. Her mom explained that there were 9 shaded squares plus 2 unshaded squares which equals to the area of one square. She explained to her mom that square root of 9 is 3. There are 3 unshaded squares and 6 shaded on the other side. So the area is 6 x 3, which equals 1 8, the area of one square and a little extra. \n\n## Notes\n\n### 1-1-6 Answer:\nLina's mom taught her how to find area of a square. She shaded the whole square first, then put a light shade over only 9 squares, she thought 4.  Then she calculated the area for the one square which would have been 4 but there were 6 over there in the dark plus 3 unshaded. So the area was 36 plus 18 which equals 54 and a little left. Lina explained that 3 6 is square root of 9. Her mom explained that she could have divided 6 by 2 to get 2 so 2 plus 3 is 5.  So 3 was the square root of 9 for the right side to be complete.\n\n#### Question on the Video Tutorial:  \nhttps://youtu.be/l79J641X_Hg", "answer": " 57"}

That is, what is.25?\n\n#### Evaluation:\nI would love to see if the answer is correct.\n\n#### Solution:\n\nIn Milk/Dark/Milk with almond we have to consider that all 4 bars can go into our box. However the whites are already taken.\nWe can write a single formula that we can plug in different quantities of bars for a specified quantity of \"Total\". If you plug 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 together for 100 they would look like:\nMilk= 14/12=1.166, Dark= 10/12=0.833, Milk with almunds= 7/12=0,5, White= 2(0)\n\nOr put in a different way: Milk = 1.166 Dark =.833 Milk with almund=.500 White = 0\n\nThe way I was trying to do this I put in the Total first and then plugged the fractions in for that amount.\nSo we multiply.25 to Dark\nand then.500 to White.\nBut this is wrong because you don't multiply by the Milk or Milk with almund.\n\nWhen you plug in different values for Milk, Milk with almonds, total you get.0833,.1666,.2500\n\nSo.833 =.1666 +. 0833 +.125.   and.2500 =.166 +. 125\n\nFor the white we use.500, So.500 =.333 +.166 + 0", "answer": " 25"}

The question states that without the vaccine, the chance of this happening is half. Using the rules of probability we understand that the probability of this happening is exactly the reciprocal of those values. That comes out to.5.\nNext we need to find the probability of Zika happening and the probability of Malaria happening. For the probability of Zika, we take the probability of Zika disease and the probability that it will not happen, and multiply them to get:\n\n(40% *.5) + (60% *.5 =37.5%)\n\nFor malaria we do the same but using the probability formula from the question.\n(92.5% of malaria after taking Malaria vaccine)/(100*.25)\n\nNext we need to add the probability of Zika and the probability of Malay so we do:\n\n(37.5% + 46.269%)/100\n\nUsing the sum and difference equation, we can sum it up to get:\n(46.259% + 37.5 % ) *.", "answer": " 15"}

Now we simplify and isolate the variable.40% of 5 = 55%of 5 = 2.5 pens out of the 20 were kept. Then 1/4 of 20 = 5 and then 2.5 + 5 = 7.5 pens.

What is the probability of a randomly picked matchbox having two to five candles?\n### Response\nTo first answer this question we must find how many candles there are per matchbox by dividing the total number of candles by the total number of matchboxes. 50/10 = 5.This tells us that on average there are 5 candles in a matchbox. Then, let\u2019s simplify all the different situations in the question.\n\nThen, we can put it in a sentence that is easier to read and see:\n\n> Then there\u2019s a 2/10 probability of a matchbox having 1 candle and a 5/10 probability of there being 5 candles.\n\n\n### Input --> Lenny bought 200 boxes of pens where each box contained 5 pens.

It is true that the 10 yrn walk is 108 percent of the 6 yr rate but since that's not the same value which I believe can only happen if the 10 yos walks at a rate of 44 ft/10 mins which makes total to 560 ft < 108 * 560ft.\n\n### Output : If you take a gallon of gas and put it all in a one gallon gas tank how long will it last you?\n\n### Output Response : Let A = 1 gallon of gas and B = 1 gallon gas bottle.

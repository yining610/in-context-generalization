To understand this, we infer that instead of selling one hundred of the clips in April, she only sold fifty.\n\n### Solution, In May, Natalia had sold fifty as in April. In May, she sold half of these fifty clips. \n\nIn May, Natalia only sold as many clips in as April, so she only sold twenty five.

C: She believes she's the only one who says those things. D: It might make more sense if the other person heard it too.\nRationales:\n1. Monkeys are known for listening to only what they want to, and the saying is about the three monkeys: one with their arms around their ears, one with their hands over their eyes, and one with their hands covering their mouth. So \"You should hear the people who haven't spoken to someone else.\" would be the most plausible sentence to go with the saying. Option A: It's logical to believe the monkeys are being used as an analogy to the people, but the saying doesn't refer to the person who has spoken to someone else, but instead, it refers to the people who haven'thad a conversation with someone else.\n\n2. Option B: It's not a logical choice, as it wouldn't make sense for the person who has had a conversation with someone else to say \"She likes hearing what her friend says.\" \n3. Option C: Is also illogical since the monkeys are not specifically referring to themselves in this analogy, so it wouldn't make much sense for the person who is the person to think \"It might make more sense if she heard what she was saying.\"\n\n4. Option D: Isn't also a valid choice since it isn't referring to the people who haven\u2019t had a conversation with someone, but rather is referring to another person who hadn't had a conversation with her.\n5.

{"text": "Jerry will spend 31.2 hours watching his daughters play and practise altogether.\n### Demontration:\nThe first stage of solving this question, is to identify the key information of the problem.\n\nThe first sentence of the problem says that Jerry\u2019s two daughters play for different teams. This means that they play for 56 teams instead of 28. The second sentence indicates that each daughter plays 8 games per season. The next paragraph says that each team practices 4 hours before each game and lasts for 2hours.\n\nFurther, the conclusion of the problem says that there are 28 daughters and 56 teams in total. Therefore, there will be two daughters from every team.\n\nIn other words, there will be two games per team. The number of hours that Jerry will spend at the field watching her daughters is equal to the number of teams  * 2. Here, the number of hours Jerry will spend at the games is 28.\n\nIn the first two paragraphs of the problem, the answer can be obtained without any mathematical calculations. The next paragraph gives the conclusion of this problem. However, to calculate the hour Jerry will spend at the fields, the following equation can only be used with 2 hours. Therefore it can be deduced that 28hours minus 4hours = 24 hours.\n\nThe final amount can be calculated to be 24 * 28 = 672hours. So, the total amount of time Jerry will spend at the game is 672 hours.\n\nTherefore, the number of hours that Jerry spends watching her daughters\u2019 games and practices is 672. \n\nThe word \u201ctotal\u201d used in the conclusion means that the hours spent watching her daughters\u2019 games are added to the hours spent watching her daughter\u2019s practice. \n\nThe question says Jerry is watching his daughters. This suggests that he is there from the beginning of the practice and the last second of the games, thus, he spent the total time watching his daughters play and train, which is the same as the total time watching the games.\nSince the problem only said Jerry is watching his daughters play and practices, the number of hours cannot be broken down.\n\nThe amount of working hours that Jerry could be spending at the field is approximately 48 hours per week.

The question is about Brandon, asking the number of geckos he has sold in the last two year.\n2. There are a total of four options: A: 170 geckos; B: 185 geckos; C: 194 geckos; and D: 195 geckos.\n3. Of the options given, only 195 gecksos makes sense as the answer: 86 from the previous year, 144 from the current year, and 145 from the next year.\n\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question is 195-geckos, which is indicated by the option: D: 194.\nAnswer: D) 194 Geckos.\n\n### A few other questions to consider with their respective rationale follows:\n1. If a bus is traveling at 75 miles/hour, how fast is it traveling in inches?\n\n2. Choice: A. 1100 inches/second (correct answer)\n4. The bus is traveling at a rate of 75 miles per hour, which is the same as traveling at a rate 75 miles in a certain amount of time.\n\n5. Hence, the time taken to travel a distance of 1 mile would be 1/75 hours or 14.3 minutes.\n6. Taking this into account, we can infer that the bus travels at an average rate of 14.3 inches per second.\n\n7. Since there is 16 inches in a foot (from the given question), we get that the bus travels 14.3/16 or 8.9 inches per second.\n8. We also get that there is 60 seconds in a minute. Thus we can calculate the actual speed of the bus to be 8.9 * 60 = 536 inches per minute.\n9. Taking the 536 into account, this gives us an answer of 536 / 60: 9 inches per second. This gives us the answer as", "answer": " 258"}

Choices: A: sew B: fashion C: create a line D: do fashion design E: create clothes\nRationale: The given options suggest what you should do if you've always been \"interested in how people dress.\" \n\n1. Option A: \"Sew\" might be related to fashion and dressing as well, but not all options are correct when seeking to answer the question.\n2. Option B: \"Fashion\" does not directly answer how to dress yourself. It's more closely related to creating clothes rather than helping you dress better. \n3. Option C: \"Create a line\" also does not directly answer how someone would dress or dress better. It simply allows the creator to market their creations. \n4. Option D: \"Do fashion design\" does not adequately respond to the question of how to dress better. Designers usually create collections, which typically takes around 1-2 months to create and release, whereas it's implied that the individual seeks quicker methods of how to improve their dress. \n5. Option E \"Create clothes\" does not adequate explain an individual's desire to know \"how to dress.\" It would be more beneficial if the instruction gave a person more context about why a person might want an explanation for how to dress better.\nThe only correct answer that directly answers the question is \"E: create clothes.\"  This answer choice allows an individual to be more creative than the others.\nAnswer:", "answer": " 1825"}

This is done by performing the reverse operation of division to simplify the equation from 16 x 52. Performing the reverse division of 16 / (4 x 52) gives us 4 / (16 x 5) and since we have a 4 to the right of the division symbol, we know that we need to multiply x4. To perform this: 16/((4x52) we have: 16/16(16)\n\nThe next step is to combine the terms using the addition symbol. The terms 4 x 52 and 16 are to the right of the + sign and can be combined and simplified to give us 4 x 16 x 8.\n\n### Additional Solutions Steps\nTo do 4 x 4, we have 4x4 = 16; to do 8x8, we use the reverse division operation of the 8s to get 1/8, which we then simplify to get 1x8 = 8. These can be written as:\n\n4 x 8 = 4x16x8 = 16x16", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "$0\n\n### Rationale:\n>The question requires us to calculate the total amount of money that Missy put in the bank and then deduct the amount she has at the end of 4 years, which would be the final amount she added to the bank. \nThis answer is calculated by applying the formula $N = (N2 + N1)*2 + N to where N1 = first year, N2 = second year, N3 = third year and N4 = fourth year.  We plug in the numbers of each year we are given, and from there, we can determine that Missy had zero in the first year.\nIn the first year, Missy puts in 1 dollar in her bank, so our formula then becomes N = N2*2 + 1.  We plug in N2 = second year = 4 dollars.\nOur mathematical formula then becomes N = (4*2) + 1 = 8. 8 dollars + 1 dollar is then equal to 9 dollars; thus, Missy had 9 dollars in her first year.\nIn subsequent years, she adds an additional 4 dollars each year. In the second year, she had an additional 8 dollars, so N2 = second year ends up being 12 dollars, in accordance with the mathematical formula.\nFor the fourth year, where Missy had 64 dollars in her bank, N4 = fourth year ends up being 64 + 64 + 12 + 1. The formula to follow in this scenario is N = (N3 + 64)*3 + 1. We plug in N3 = third year = 64. Thus, our formula becomes N = (64 + 63)*3 + 1 = 170 dollars.\nFrom here, we can then subtract the N at the end of year 3. In this case, N3 = third and last year = 64, thus bringing N down to 106 dollars.\nWe then subtract 106 from 170. The result is -64, which ends up showing that the total is less than 0. Thus, the answer is that she didn\u2019t put any money into the bank at all in the first year. She only ever added additional money to subsequent years. \n>\n>\n\n### 2.5 In", "answer": " 30"}

Then subtract the no transport from the D.\n5. 60% of -50% = 30%. That's the number of employees who drive and also don't take public transportation. This is option B. \n6. Then plug option B in the equation for no transport.\n7. 50% of -30% = 15%. This is the number of employees who take public transportation but also don't drive.\n8.

{"text": "The question is asking us how many more red bouncing balls Kate bought compared to yellow bouncy balls given that one pack contains 18. The red bounce ball can either be less than or more than the yellow bounce ball. To approach this question with logic, the most important thing is to consider what is the sum of how many more red bounce balls and yellow bounce balls Kate bought respectively. When we start by rewriting the question \"how many more red bounces balls than yellow bounce balls did Kate buy\" as a compound inequality which is a bouncy balls greater than 18 (<) or less than 18 (>, we can then start to work the problem. As a way to make this clearer i have added a few more steps of how the problem could be solved.\n\n### Rationales\n1. Since we understand the question is asking how many more red bubble balls Kate bought in comparison to the yellow bubble balls purchased, we can start by rewriting the statement as a compound inequality, which is \"greater than or equal to 18\" (>=18) or \"less than or equal to 20\"(<=20).\n2. We know that one (1) of the 8-pack of bubble balls Kate bought contained 18 bubble balls which means that each pack also equaled to a total of 24 bounce balls.\n3. Since the question is asking for the number that Kate bought more of than the other (in the yellow bubble ball case). We can start with the equation 24 > 20 thus leading to the first step \"bounce balls in red greater than bounce balls in yellow\" (\u226524).\n4. To solve for this we can multiply 2 by four (2*4) so that we find the number the red bounce ball must be to make the equation true. The next step of adding 1 to 6 (the number of yellow bounce balls in the \"yellow bounce bags\") will get us to (6+1) and then to two bounce balls. If I multiply this final number by two again (2*2) and add 2 to this number (2*2*2) it should lead to the final answer of 6.\n\nAnswer: 3 packs of yellow bungee balls", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "5:00\n\n### Description:\nIn this example, the instructions ask a question followed by the amount of pounds and cups that were stated. The next step is to then calculate the necessary amount of cups needed by Angie, and then find the number of cup each pound will make. This is to determine the number of days the coffee will last Angie.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe instructions say Angie purchased 3 lbs. and also 3 cup. The first step will need to be determining how much each lb will make. \n\n40 cups - 3 cup/lb = 43 cups each lb.\n\nThis means the each pound of coffee will be able to make 43 cups. So each cup will give Angie 3 cups + 1 cup so she will have 43 cups in this. And this means she can have it every day for 43 days.\n\n\n### Input:\"What are some ways that we can use 7 pounds of sugar?\"\n\n### Description:\"In this example, the instructors ask a question followed by a number.

Ann spends 2 hours and saves $50 per set of 20, with 100 sets of 20 pencils. 100 sets = 2,000 pencils. So Ann saves $1,000 by sharpening all 2,00 pencils\n3. Thus, the correct solution is: Ann saves $1, 000 by shapping 2, 000 pencil.\nAnswer: $1, 0 00", "answer": " 3600"}
{"text": "24, because there are 18 tires on the 4 bikes and 18 on the 12 cars.\n\nExplanation:\nWe could start by assuming the vehicles on the lot are numbered 1-24 in a random order. This would mean that the 18 tires are on vehicles 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17. Vehicles 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 will have no tires. Vehicles 3, 7, 11, 15 and 19 will have spare tires, and vehicles 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 will have no spare tires. Therefore, all vehicles for sale have a total of 18 tires.

(Check) Answer: No!  \nThe student is most likely to complete all aspects of the project on time if he is well-versed in all 6 of the following aspects: (a) basic structural engineering, (b) electrical design, (c) project planning, (d) technical writing, (e) safety practices, and (f) risk mitigation.  \nRationale: Electrical design, project planning, and technical writing are not engineering specific. In electrical design, the student is most likely aware of circuit diagrams if he/she has been taught the concepts in high school/college. Risk mitigation is not strictly an engineering aspect but the student would have heard about risk mitigation through various scenarios and probably the topic is on the syllabus. Risk mitigations are always applicable to engineering projects (most of the time). Therefore, risk mitigation can be answered as \"yes\". However, (e) safety measures and (f) project management are not strictly engineering specific. They are part of a project manager's role and responsibilities. A project manager is a person who is well trained in safety procedures and project management. A civil engineer would be better suited to design a project and plan a timeline. It is a very detailed profession. Therefore, all the questions that are not engineering specific should be answered \"no\" and this will help to differentiate civil engineers from project managers.\n\n### Task Description:The student is building", "answer": " 66"}

Therefore a child must get in so the weight does not exceed it. A child whose average weight is 50 pounds below the average weight of three adults (390-50=340). So the child must weigh exactly 64 pounds.\n1. There are two children. For simplicity let\u2019s assume it\u2019s a boy and girl with equal weights. Their weight must be 64 pounds to make it up to 390 plus 64 = 454 pounds, which is 60 pounds below the maximum weight limit of 600 pounds.\n2. Let\u2019s also assume it\u2019s an older boy and girl with different weights. The boy has an average of 64 pounds and the girl has an average of 50 pounds (160-50=110). Their weights must be 64 and 50 respectively. The total weight is 164 (64+50) pounds, which is 40 pounds less than the maximum limit of 204 pounds. Because this satisfies the equation, let\u2019s assume the two children are equal weights.\n3. Since the two children weighed in at 64 pounds each, they did not overload the elevator.\n\n### Input:\"As if she were a queen, that woman in the blue coat was greeted by people she knows.\"\n\n### Response:\"She was a queen after all, just like the woman in the blue coat.\"\n\n### Demosntration:\nTo find the best phrase for the blank, you have to understand what the original sentence is about. \"As if ___\" phrase can be used in all kinds of situations.

Here's the answer I got:\n\nIn the morning she cooked 9/5th or 9/10th of the rice = 9/11 grams\n\nIn the evening she cooked 1/4 of what she had left = 8/11 grams (remember 11 is a factor of 5/4)\n\nSo: 9/5 = 8/10\n\nSubtract 8/10 from 9/10 to get 1/10\n\nAdd 1/10 from her morning meal = 1 extra gram left\n\nSo she had 8/10 + 8/10 = 16/10 - 1 + 1/10 = 9/5 or 8 grams left in the morning.\n\n16/10-1/10 = (11/10)/10 = 11/5 or 22/10 = 2.2 = 2 grams\n\n8/10 = (7/10)/18, so subtract 22/5(7/2) from 8/10: 1.6/2 = 0.8 = 8/8 = 1 gram.\n\nso she has 3 extra grams left = 8 + 2 + 1 = 3 extra grams\n\nAdd it", "answer": " 750"}
{"text": "The total number of eggs laid is 33000, a number that contains all the given digits.  \n\n### Rationales\n1. The problem asks for the total number of eggs laid by the frog over the span of the four days. \n2. We can infer that the frog is not an ordinary frog laying eggs on a day to day basis, as indicated by the increasing number of eggs laid over the four days. Hence, the problem must be solving for an unusual behavioral pattern of laying. \n3. The frog starts off by laying 50 eggs on the first day. \n4. On the second day she doubled her previous production of eggs, i.e. 100 eggs. \n5. She doubles the previous production of eggs, meaning that each consecutive product becomes double the product before it, so she lays 272 = (100)(2) eggs. \n6. The third day she doubles the previous production, so she lays again 504 = (272)(2) eggs.\n7. On the last day, she doubles the previous three days' production, meaning that she now has 1108 = (504)(2) eggs. Finally, the total number of eggs is 1108 + 500 + 100 + 272 + 504 + 1108, which when divided by 4 gives 3300.\n8. Conveniently, the 3300 is a multiple of all the digits provided. \n9.

If she realizes $400 profit, how many books has she sold to make this amount of money?\"\n\nThe question asks \"how many books has she sold\". \n\nNotice that we are not asked about how much money she has made, but how many books she has sold, because \"the same amount\" is only relevant in the context of having to do with the same amount of books.\n\n1. \"As much\" is not the answer. Although the sentence would make more sense with the phrase \"as much\", if we consider the sentence alongside the question, there's no way we can tell that this would make more sense. \n2. \"So much\" can be considered similar to \"as much\" and is therefore not applicable to the question.\n3. \"A lot of\" doesn't seem to be a possible answer choice because its wording is ambiguous and would likely be misinterpreted.\n4. \"As little as\" probably should have been a choice, but in the context of the question it's not necessary. \n5. \"Hardly any\" is probably a better choice considering that it's very close to zero.

Using 15 as the number of years ago today\u2019s aunt could be 3*(5/15)=10 years ago, or 10 years plus the 3 years that Cori is today, equals 13.\n\n## Inference\n\nAn inference is a thought or belief we draw that we can't know with certainty. So, we can only assume that it is truthful based on the evidence. When making inferences, it is helpful to think about the following:\n\n1. The inference relates to some logical assumption that has been deduced from observations.\n2. We can't directly observe the inference because the fact exists, but we've observed events or clues that might help us infer what this fact could be.\n\nAs an example, when the car stops at a red light, the inference can be drawn that it needs gas, because the light is a signal that the car needs to get gas. But, we don't know for sure that the car needs gas, we can only infer it by connecting observations to assumptions.\n\nThere are a few different types of inferences and they are as follows:\n\n- Deduction: An inference of a specific fact or assumption, after a set of observations have been made. E.g. I know that you love me because you always show me support.\n- Induction: A belief or assumption where we\u2019re taking a broad observation. E.g. All tall animals need more water than short animals.\n- Hypothesis: An inference where we\u2019re wondering if there is a relationship between observations - this is often done in the scientific method to test claims about what is true. E.g. When we drink water, we feel more hydrated.\n\n## Example\n\nThe diagram below is of a rectangular room.

{"text": "### Demostration:\nLet us use the given variables to form six algebraic expressions, each describing the number of catches Joe has made. The variables are: $$c=Joe\u2019s catches, x=Derek\u2019s catches, y=the number of extra catches that Derek made,\\ and z=Tammy\u2019s catches. Our six expressions are:\n$$c=23x-y\\\\\nc=x+y-2x(2x-1)\\\\\nc= 2x+y+x-2x(y-1)\\\\\nc=(z-1)+y-x(3y-z)\\\\\nc=yz\\\\\nc=6(z+1)-x(z+y+x)+16x$$\nThe last expression is the smallest of all, therefore, the correct answer is $c=6(z+(1))-x(z+y(+)x)+16x$.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The problem is asking about how many times Derek and Tammy caught the ball each. Forward the variables that each person caught $x$ times, $y$ and $z$.\n2. Write down what Joe threw and caught with his own hands, namely $c$.\n3. Next, we'll be looking for $c-x$. When $c$ and $x$ are added together, $c$ will have been thrown and caught by Joe once more than $x$, as there are no other players except Joe. As for $c-x$, it must mean that Joe threw and caught the ball once more than $x$ times.\n4. Similarly, we will be looking for $c+y$, $c-z$, $c-(x+y)$, $c-2x$, and $c-zx$ in order to find how many times each player caught the ball.\n5. By now, we have the expressions for $c$ as well as $c$ without any variables. \n6. Plug in each expression for each variable, and we will see that $c=6(1)-5(1)-14+16(1)$, simplifies to $c=6(2)-5(1)-6+16$ and simplifies to $c=(6+1)(2)-2(1)+2(6+1)$", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "Max spent 40 minutes doing all his homework. He spent three times more time doing geography and two times more doing biology and two times less doing history.\n```\nRationales:\n1. We know that biology takes 1.5 times more than history and history takes 2 times more than geography. This means \n    >Biology time + History time =2 * g(biology)\n    >=2 * g(history) + geography\n2. Similarly, it's easy to figure out that the maximum value can be no greater than two times because if he works for more than that, he can't spend less time on history.\n3. This means that Max spent 20:\n    > = (Biology + Geography)\n4. We know that the left side is greater than 2 times than right side because he couldn't have taken more time for history because he already spent 1.5 times and at this point it is equal to two times.\n5. So the left is 40:\n    > 40 = (Biology+Geography)\n6. Now, looking at the right, we subtract history from both terms\n    > 4 = (Biology geography)\n7.

Now, I need to count the total each day.  I'm going to start with the Monday count, which is 672.  On Tuesday, I take that 672 and subtract 124 books, which leaves me with 548 books.

This is an incorrect solution, as this means she placed 4016 of snow bricks in one column.\n\nOption C: 28 brick of snow was used in the bottom and top part of the igloo. 28*12=320 was not the amount of snow used.\n\nOption D: Libby used a total of 208 bricks of snow to build the igleio.\n\nThe correct answer is option D.\n```\nOutput: Option D is the correct answer. The bricks of snow are in a total of 28 pieces(bottom with 12 and top with 8), which then equals to 208.\n```\n\n### Input 2:You work with two shades of yellow. You do not have a yellow paint. You have 40 drops of the first yellow shade, and 90 drops of the second yellow shade. How many drops of yellow paint can be manufactured using this amount of paint?\n\n### Input :You want to create a yellow paint from 40 drops and 90 drobs, where the paint has 2 yellow shades. What is the number of yellow paint you can have?\n\n### Rationale :Because the paint is only given in shades we cannot determine what the exact amount of yellow is in it. We do know that there are a total amount of 40 and 90 droplets(shades). To calculate the shades we can subtract the colors and obtain the total amount of drops of yellow paint we have. To solve this problem we will subtract the amount for the second shade from the second shade.\n\nFrom the information the", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "Robin ate ten cupcakes.\n\n#### Demonstration: The solution is straightforward. The question asks, \"How many cupcakes did she eat?\" and the only option that accurately answers to is she did eat eleven.\n\n#### Rationales: Option A: Robin ate one cupcake with no frosting.\nOption B: Robin ate six cupcakes with buttermilk. This doesn't accurately match the question. The question states Robin ate four cup cakes with chocolate and TWO TIMES as many with buttercream, so you should divide by two, i.e. TWO times two cupcakes or FOUR cupcakes since it twice as much. As such, she'll eat 4 cupcakes out of buttercream and 2 of chocolate, a total of 6. Now 6 divided by 2 is 3 - she eats three cupcakes out of the buttercream and two out of chocolate.\n\nOption C: Robin  ate ten cupcaker with chocolate sauces.

{"text": "232.5\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The first statement that was given is Celeste's time. Because her time is twice that of the other time, we can figure that the original time is 12.5, because it can be multiplied on another 12.5 to get 25 because 25=12.5 x 2. From here on we can subtract McClain's time to get the total amount of minutes that the 3 people worked:\n12.5 x2 - 8.5 = 16.875 = 20 \n2. But we realize that Celeste worked for 12 hours and 5 minutes. So we can multiply her time by 60 to get her total minutes:\n12.0 x 60 = 720.\n3. Now, we subtract Bianca's time and multiply that by 60 to figure out her total minutes:\n8.5 x 60 =480.\n4.

{"text": "Kris Blows up 12 balloons with 26 minutes of effort. Kris and her brother would blow up 30 balloons after 30 minutes of effort. Rationale: We can take the following steps to solve the problem: 1. First, we can determine the number of balloon Kris can blow up in one minute with the help of her brother. From the given information, we can write the equation as: 2 B = 2/5. Multiplying both sides by 2, we can write the second as: 4 B = 5. Therefore, Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute with the help of his brother.  Second, we can determine how many Kris and her brother will blow up after 15 minutes, or 15 minutes with 2 helpers. We can express this as follows: 5 B = 2/2. Multiplying and dividing both sides by 10, we can write the same as: 5 (2/4) = 2. In this second expression, the second term in the equation is the help from their brother, which works twice as fast. Therefore, after 15 minutes of effort with 2 helpers, Kris and her brother blew up 5 balloons, or 2.5 balloons each. This result is reflected in the following figure.  \n    \n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88620467/169573539-46e747ae-bf39-476c-a8a1-759a40f21ca7.png\" width = 500 alt=\"Picture alt text\" />\n\n    \nThird, we can determine the amount of balloons Kris will blow up after 30 minutes, or 30 minutes with 2 help. If we express the equation this time, we can write the following: 17.5 B = 5/5, dividing both sides by a similar value will give us B = 5/4. From this, we can conclude that after 30 minutes with the help of the brother Kris and her brother each blew 5 balloons in total, or a total of 10", "answer": " 240"}
{"text": "> 14 rabbits.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We can set up a system by equating every integer with the number of rabbits.\n2. We have a cage with 13 rabbits and counting.\n3. If the rabbits in the cag e are increased by seven, we have as total of rabbits.\n4. We take the division to get the quotient.\n5. Since the divisor is a single digit and the dividend is at least 13, the quotient is greater than one. Thus, the remainder is zero.\n6. Since the remainder is zero, there is a perfect remainder.\n7. Since rabbits is a counting unit and 14 is the answer, we can say that seven more rabbits are needed to complete the first group.\n8. Thus, 14 is the total amount of rabbits we have in the cage.\n9.

If bats indeed had such a capability, they could have jumped directly from the ground and not from \"high places\". \n- Option E, \"bat live in a house of its own,\" is not a sentence in any sense. So, Option E is ruled out altogether.\n- From A, \"cannot fly while in the wind,\" option B is eliminated.\n- Option A is still true, although not in the way the OP interprets. Yes, bats do weigh 3 times what humans do and are stronger than us, but this doesn't mean humans can't fly with them. \n- Option B could be true if the OP is referring to the wind knocking bats off a windmill/crane; even then, it's not clear if the bats cannot fly while in winds.\n- Option C is still true; while bats can jump from high heights, they still need a house to fly.

Therefore, we must consider all possible options, starting with those that apply to Angie.\n\n- Option B) More than or less than Shelley's purchase, also refers to Angie's choice, but when we examine the rest of the problem, we can see that Angie may have purchased significantly more than four pretzels (i.e. Angie probably bought six pretzels, the first choice in the issue with Shelly's pretzels.)\n- Option C) Half as many pretzels could potentially provide the correct response because Angie and Shelley both bought pretzels from an assortment of more than one pretzel.

We know that the total was 33, half was 16.\n\nThus, she received 17 pieces.\n\nSince Julie didn't receive half the number of pieces that Tabitha received, we know Julie didn't get all the candy Tabitha got.

{"text": "The ratio between the number of classrooms and the number of desks is 3 : 2, meaning that each classroom will have a total of 90 desks. This means that in order for every student to have their own desk, the number of students must be divisible by 90.\n\nLet's assume that there are 15 students in each classroom, which would result in 90 students total. With 90 students, it is not possible for every student to have his/her own desk, as the total number of desks is only 90, or 90/90 = 1. Thus, we can rule out this scenario as a possible solution.\n\n### Note:\nOne way to approach this question is to find the possible ranges of solutions, taking each classroom as an individual unit.\n\nFor example, if we were to look at the first classroom, there are 30 students, and there are 30 desks. Thus, there are 3 possible ways to arrange these students: A) 30/1, B) 15/2, or C) 1/30. Likewise, each remaining classroom follows its own strategy:\n\nFor Classroom 2, the arrangement is 15/2 or 7.5/14, or 1/2.

{"text": "140 pounds of food.\n\n### Rationale:\nSince we know that a dog eats twice the amount of food that a puppy eats, a dog eats 3 times the amount that a puppy does, and each puppy eats 3 times more than a dog, that means that dogs eat 9 times as much as puppies. When multiplied by the time they eat 3 of this amount, that would make the amount of food eaten by puppies and dogs be 27, and that is more than the amount of food the dogs eat: 4 times 3 which equals 12 pound of food.\n\nSince the food in dogs and puppies will each have 27 times more food than the other, puppies will have 69 and dogs will have 69 plus the amount they eat which is 60 (4 times as many as a puppy eats). Since the puppies will have more, and the dogs will also eat 69 pound of food, this means the dogs would eat more than the puppies since they ate 69 pounds of food and the puppies ate 27 pounds of food.\nThere is also the fact that 12 pound is divided by 3, plus another 6 pound which is divided by 3 again, meaning the 3 pounds of food that they eat each day, was taken 3 times more from the original amount of food (27 times) which was the amount eaten by the puppies and dogs that were at the campsite. The original amount of dog plus puppy food was 27 pound (3 times 9), the amount of pound divided by 3 was 9 and all divided by 3 once again would give 3, meaning that 3 pounds of food was taken from each time the dogs at the campsite eat the 27 pound food 3 times in order to eat 27 pound of food 3 times (the dogs at the campsites, eating 4 pounds of food, multiplied by 3 (which is 3 pounds of food times 3 which equals pound of food), giving them 12 pound plus 6 pound of food, which is 18 pound of food, that they will eat, each time they eat 3 pound", "answer": " 108"}

How many books do they have altogether?\n### Rationales:\nWe must first know the problem and how to solve it.\n- First, the problem states that \"Alice has 32 books\"\n- Second, Bob has 44 instead of 40\n- Third, Jack possesses 55 books\n- Next, the problem mentioned that \"they sell some of their books\"\nThis tells us that some or few of their books are gotten rid of.\n- Therefore, the problem hints that the books that were got rid of has a total of 58 books\n- Based on the given information, the total remaining books among \"Alice, Bob and Jack\" are 57\n- We then eliminate the option where the books left is 52 books. (This is because 52 books are not mentioned in the question)\n- \"They sell some of their books\". This can be understood with Alice and Bob sold their books, leaving Jack with 55 books. \n- Thus, Alice and Bob sold a total of 82 books, leaving just 75 books among 'Alice, Bob and \"Jack\".\n- Lastly, the last option \"52\" is removed since it is never mentioned in the question.\n\n- Therefore, the answer is 57. \nGrade:6\n\n- \"If you buy 26 bottles of paint, then you get 2 free.

This result is significant because it shows a notable development in the rate at which the fishmonger sells salmon, compared to earlier.\n5. A simple computation to determine the total amount of fish sales in two weeks is:50 + 150.\n### Detailed Explanation\n- 1. First, the basic data presented in the task are:\n\n```\nThis week, the fish monger sold 5 kg of salmon. \nHe sold three times more the next week, \n\nIn two weeks he sold 15 kg. \n```\n\n- 2. To answer the question, we need a basic understanding of the mathematical context of the text, including the concepts of addition, multiplication and division.\n- 3. The question asked about the total amount of fish the fishmonger actually sold in 2 weeks. \n- 4. A fishmonger's business is to sell fish, not its raw weight; in this case, there is a 50 kg of fish per week, and a 150 kg fish weight in 2 weeks. This means he sold 3 times more in one week than in the other. \n- 5. The total amount of fish sold is 50 plus the total amount of fish that the fishmonger had sold in one week, and then multiply this sum by 3 to determine the total amount that he sold in two weeks.\n- 6. The final answer is: 50 + 100 = 150. \n\n### Democratizing access to information and knowledge is crucial to helping the most vulnerable people in society. \n\n## Demonstration/Explanation:\n1.

While they could be used in multiple contexts, they are particularly useful for reading comprehension and for reviewing a text before writing an essay or producing an answer.\n\nIn response to this task, the options suggested are meant to help candidates understand the question. Specifically, what are the facts in the text which should influence their decision.\n\n##### Consider Step 1:\n\nHere's Step 1: \"Mary has 29 shirts in total\". This sentence conveys the fact that Mary has 36 brown shirt, 1 blue shirt and 12 others.\n\n##### Step 2:\n\nIn Step 2, we have to answer the question \"how many shirts does Mary have left?\" To answer this, we can assume that Mary has already given away half of her blue and third of her brown shirt. We can simplify this information to one sentence, which is: \"Mary has given away half of her blues and third of her browns\", and it doesn't necessarily mean she gave them all away.\n\nTherefore, she can have 19 shirts left. This sentence is Step 2.\n\n##### Final Step:\n\nOnce we know that Mary has 19 shirtts left, Step 3 is to determine the total number of blue shirts she has. According to the instructions, the choice given is \"C: 18 shirtts\", which stands as a good answer.\n\n##### Explain the reasoning behind each step:\n\n##### Step1:\n\nMary has 56 shirts in total. The problem here is to answer the question \"How many shirts does Marie have left?\". It does not explicitly state that Mary has to keep half and third of her shirts. Therefore, we can answer how many shirts she has left after subtracting her half and third of her blues.\n\nTo subtract both half and third of her brown and blue shirts, the following statement will be used: \"Mary has left 26 shirts.\"", "answer": " 37"}

As for \"Aww, how cute.\" it does have an exclamation mark, and it is consistent with the question, so it should not be marked\n\nLeft with D and E, \n\nSentense D:\" It flies!\" has an exclamation, option D: \"It flies!\" should be deducted.\n\nSentence E: \"Where did it come from?\" has no exclamation, option E: \"Where did the come from?\" should be deducted.

The height, width and length of a box are all equal. This means the volume of a cube is equal to the product of its measurements.\n7. So, the volume of Justin's 36x46=3024 box is 3024 cubic inches.\n8. Also, there are 2.54 centimeters in a inch. This number can be used to convert the inch-unit into the decimal-unit.

The last pile has 6 hands holding 9 bananas each.\n10. Thus, 6 x 6 x 9 = 216 bananas.\n11. From both piles, there are 55 bananas (45+216 ), which are divided by 12 monkeys, yielding 46 bananas for each monkey.\n\nInput: Every week a pizza vendor delivers more pizzas than the next day's sales.

Choices: 1. (3,4) 2. (\u22125,\u22122) 3. (\u22123, 0) 4. (9, 0) 5. (13, 4) Rationale: The question involves understanding why the line drawn would not be considered vertical. For example, the line through (3,5) would be vertical if it went straight up above the number 5 on the y-axis.\n\n- Option 1: (3,4) is incorrect because the line drawn on the y-axes would be slanted horizontally, not vertical as asked. \n- Option 2: (\u22125,\u2212-2) is incorrect since the line drawn would have to start below the number -2 on the y-axess instead of above, making it not vertical as required.\n- Option 3: (\u22123,0) is inconclusive because it would be considered vertical if the line didn't start from (\u22123,4), which it does not do. \n- Option Rationale: Option 4: (9,0)is incorrect because the line drawn wouldn't be considered vertical since it would have a slant, so (\u22123,0), Option 5: (13,4)is incorrect because while the line drawn on the x-axes is vertical, the line drawn on the Y-axis would be horizontal, making it not vertical. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3.

The two remaining people each lost '20 kgs'\n\nThe weight 2 people lost can be summed to 10kg. Add this to the weight lost by the first person '27kgs', hence the total becomes 37kg.\nNow the total lost by the 4 people is 103kgs - 37kgs = 66kgs.\n\nThis leaves us with the question what has the remaining 66 kgs been distributed amongst the remaining 2 people. \n\nA simple process of elimination leads us to conclusion : 2 people lost 33kgs each.\n\nAnswer: B. The people lost 33 kilograms each.\n\n### Rationale for B\nThe question is asking how many kilograms each of the last two men lost. Therefore, the people lost 33 kg each. The first person lost one third of the weight. The second person lost one quarter of the weight. The remaining two people lost the same amount as each other. Hence, the sum of their lost weight is also equal to one fourth of the total lost weight. Converting to kilograms, they would have each lost 33 kg.\nAnswer: B. 33 kilogram each\n\n### Rationales for B:\nThe question is asking for the amount of weight lost by the remaining 2 people each. The weight 2 people lost together in total, is the total lost. \nConsidering the question further, it can be observed that, first one person lost '33 kgs', which reduces the total kg by '33'. The remaining 2 lost rest '37 kgs' together.\n\nIf one had to guess which person would have lost the lesser of those 37 kgs, then obviously the first person would have lost it.\n\nThe question is very ambiguous, the solution B. 33kgs is the only one that can be conclusively given. \nThe remaining 2 people lost 18 kgs each.", "answer": " 28"}

Who\u2019s the audience?\n\n### Rationales:The sentence mentions an independent clause and a dependent clause that can stand together as a sentence. The independent clause (IC) is \u201cIt was only a short walk home.\u201d (The IC can be understood as a statement, which is true or false.) We can tell from the context that this IC is the sentence\u2019s subject. The dependent clause (DC) is \u201cso he rarely needed a car.\u201d The DC can be considered information about or the reason why the subject in the IC does/doesn\u2019t do something. So, since it describes the subject, it is the DC and it can be considered relative (or attributive) in nature.\n\nThis can be identified by the fact that when the DC is not used as a sentence (too many commas and no subject), \u201cso [insert verb] he rarely needed a car\u201d can stand alone as a sentence. The IC gives the reason why this statement is true, which indicates it is the object of the sentence, and is the sentence\u2019s predicate. In this case, \u201cso he rarely needed\u201d is the predicate, and \"only a short walk home\" is the subject, so we know it is a subject-predicate relationship. In this case, the subject and object are in complementary subject-object (cSO).\n\nThe subject-object complementary syntax here shows that if there is a IC", "answer": " 60"}

Since Henry was the only individual that was not involved, he only contributed as an outlier: an individual who isn\u2019t part of a group or category.\n3.

Because Henry was the only one who was not included, it\u2019s logical that every individual was involved with the exception of Henry.\n6. Since Henry was the outlier who didn\u2019t contribute, his absence caused a drop from a total of 45 to 39.\n7.

In other words, Bob and Bella celebrated their second anniversary two months ago, not two years ago.\n\nMore context can help us understand that in two months, the couple will celebrate their 5th anniversary, so they didn\u2019t celebrate their 5nth anniversary in two months ago because it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nBy taking the information from the context and applying it to the underlined expression, we can derive that Bob and Bella celebrated the 2nd anniversary two months ago.\n\nThe expression can be changed to indicate whether Bob and Bella celebrated it in February or in March. By using the context, we can understand that they won\u2019t celebrate their anniversary for another three months, so the answer is in February.\n\nThe original expression was two months ago. \nWe can replace \u201ctwo months ago\u201d with an exact month so that the statement is true. We can replace \u201ctwo months\u201d with Febuary, March, April and so on. \nThe number of months ago depends on Bob and Bella\u2019s anniversary date and how long is a month in their country. We can use a calculator to work out in how many months ago Bob and Bella celebrated. \nIf the answer is a month with 31 days, replace \u201ctwo months ago\u201d, which is also 60 days ago, into the expression with that month. \nThe answer for the revised expression should be 31 days ago, not", "answer": " 18"}

It remains to account for $6.25 - $1.35 (0.25 + 0.10) = $4.90. It's important to note that it cannot be a quarter and a dime, since Mark gave the cashier $2.05 in cash and the remainder $5.95 in change, so 0.25 + $5.95 will NOT equal $1.35, which leaves us with $3.52. In a situation where only 1 quarter and 0.25 dime is left, Mark must receive $1.23 to reach that amount.\n\n- We only have 2 nickels (0.05) for the $5.95 balance, so Mark gets a total of $0.50 in change.\n\n- We need $7.00-1.23-$0.50 (total 6.25)\n\n- Therefore, Mark gets 2 nickels in change.\n\nAnswer: Two\n\n### Input : I'm a lawyer.

In other words, if Mabel and Amanda have 36 marbles together, it doesn't matter how many marbles do either of them have because the total will be the same. \n - **(2)** : The relationship between Amanda (who needs marbles) and Katrina (who doesn't) is 5:1, meaning that if Amanda has 4 marbles, Katrina will have 20.

{"text": "Carrie needs nine square feet of wrapping paper for all three presents.\n\nWe are supposed to figure out how much paper is required to be able to wrap all the presents. Therefore, the options \"not enough\" and \"too much\" are incorrect.\n\nIf Carrie has two square feet of wrapping for the first present, she can't wrap the second present because it requires three-quarters of the amount, which is one square foot less than Carrie has to work with. The same thing goes for the third present. Thus Carrie could wrap the first two presents, but not the third. This way, the total amount of paper needed is 5 square feet, but Carrie only needs 2 + 3 + 2 = 7 square feet. Therefore, Carrie needs 2 more square feet, thus 9 square feet.\n\nSince the three presents can be wrapped with 7 square feet, we can multiply that amount by 3 to get 21 square feet of paper. We can check that we are correct by dividing the amount of wrapping paper Carrie needs by the number of presents, to get the amount that Carrie needs to cover each present, which is the same as the square feet of the present + the square feet of overage. For example, if the first present is two square feet, the total square feet to be wrapped up is (9-2+9) = 21. Thus, to wrap the first present she needs (2/21) wrapping paper, or half a square foot. This makes sense because the second present requires 3/21 or one and a half square feet, and the third present needs three square feet. The only problem left is the answer for the overage. Since there are three presents, the overage can be 3(1-7). This means 3(7) = 21, which means there is no overage. Therefore, we can conclude that we are right, and thus our answer is (9-2) + (3-2) = 9 because of the three presents and how they require wrapping paper and the total for each present.\n\n### Answer: 9 square feet\n\n----", "answer": " 7"}

The more the boy studied, the greater the chance he had of passing his exam.\n\n### Answer\nAs soon as he started studying, he did not meet the requirement of a passing grade. If he continues studying, chances of him passing increases. We can conclude that it is more likely that the student study continuously to improve his grades. He will then have a better chance of passing the exams.\n\nAnswer: \n### Input:Sales of ice cream double after the ice cream manufacturing plant is completed. The number of people living in the city will increase by 4 times after the plant is completed. How many times will the ice cream consumption rate increase?.\n\n### Response\nThe sales of ice cream doubled after the plant was complete. When the plant is completed, the consumption rate will double again. Now, the consumption rate will be 2 times more than the sales which is double the sales. Therefore, the consumption rate has increased 3 times.\n\n### answer:\nAfter the plant was complete, the sales doubled. When you multiply the consumption rate with the sales which is 2, the answer is 2. When 2 is multiplied by 2 it results in 4. Therefore, the consumption will increase 4 times.\n\n## Questions:\n* A: The subject uses verbs ending in -ing in his essay, but the teacher is critical of it.\n* B: The teacher is critical of the subject's essay because it doesn't have a title. \n* C: The subject had trouble with the beginning of the essay.\n* D: The subject writes his essay only from memory.\n\n## ANSW", "answer": " 220"}

{"text": "He spent an hour and 5 minutes on the sideline.\n\n### Rationale:\nIn the question, the amount of time he spent on the sideline after he played 20 minutes is known. We will use this number to determine the amount of time Mark played after he rested.\n\nWe know Mark played for another 30 minutes. Hence, his time in the game is (1/30 + 20) minutes = 60 minutes.\n\nSince the amount of time he was on the sideline after the game was 1 hour and 5 minutes, we can subtract the 20 minutes he played from the 90-minutes he spent in the game to get the time he spent on the side line.\n\nWe also know that he played (30 + 60) minutes, which equals 90 minutes or 1 and a half hours.\n\nThis gives us ((90 - (20 + 90)) minutes, which equals 60 minutes. We can round it to the nearest integer to get 60 minutes or an hour and a half.\n\nAnswer: The amount of time he spent playing soccer was 20 minutes. After playing a total of 20 + 30 = 50 minutes, he rested for another 50 minutes at the side line. He then played for the remainder of the 90 minutes to a total of 90 - 50 = 40 minutes.\n\nThis gives the answer of the amount of time he played was 40 minutes. The amount of time he rested was 60 minutes. The amount he played and rested was (40 + 60)= 100 minutes, or one hundred minutes, or 1 hour and 40 minutes. Since 60 minutes = 1 hour, the time on the sideline was 1 hour and a half. We can leave it in hour-and-a-half or state that it is 90 minutes or a hundred minutes.\n\nWe can conclude that he spent 90 minutes on the sideline, which equals 1 hour and a 5 minutes.\n\nAnswer: He spent 1 hour and 20 minutes on the sidline.

From the options provided by the question, we can tell that his mom doesn't have anything to do with the fundraiser that he's doing, since it appears to be a school project.\n3. his brother is another option that can be ruled out since the question states that he has already sold 4 rolls of wrapping paper, so he's covered in the first part of the question.\n4. Then, the last option that we have from the scenario is Chandler's aunt. Since we cannot rule out his mother and his brother from the initial part of the question, the most sensible explanation on the options provided would be his aunt.\n5. With this rationale, we now have to look at how many rolls his aunt had to start with.\n6. The first few sentences of the scenario tell that: Chandler needs to raise money for a school fundraiser He sells paper and toys to raise money A woman at the fundraiser bought 3 rolls of the wrapping paper When we look at the 6th sentence, it's clear that the woman bought 3 rolls, so she had a total of 3 rolls in total, or 3 units to start with.\n7.

However, we find out from the question that 10 cookies were sold by the girl scouts. That leaves us a total of 90 cookies sold so far. \n\nThe question says that the total costs to go to the pool is $2.50 + $2.50x10 = $27.00. This equates to 27. That's the last number of cookies sold. \n\nLet's call x the number of cookies sold so far. Then, 90 + x = 27. In other words, x = 27 - 90, which equals -63.\nTherefore, 27x = 30 - 63 = 33, which means the girl scouts sold a total of 33 cookies.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much money they have left. We look for any information that relates to the money or cost in the question.\n\nWe say that the 90 sold cookies were each sold at $3.33. So what we really have is $3.33x - 63 equals $30. \n\nBy plugging in the 33 into each equation:\n\n$3.33 x - 63 = $30\n\n\n\n\n$33x - 90= 30\n\nIn other words:\n\nx = 33 - 90\n\nNow plugging in to our original equation to solve for x:\n\n$33 x = 30 -63$\n\nSo then:\n\nx  = 100*33/93 = 4\n\nThe girl", "answer": " 5"}

It took no more than 40 minutes for Joseph and his friends to make popcorn before the movies at the same rate as they made fries. They could have made fries for 40 minutes before the movies, but since it took them twice as long to make fries, they made poutine instead of fries. The first movie is one and a half hours long, the second is three hours long, and it is shorter to add two movies together than both individually.\n\n### Explanation of answer: \nAs the question asks how long did it take to prepare food, we must first determine when we are supposed to start the time. If we start our time at the beginning of the question, then it took them around fifteen minutes to cook for two movies. However, if we start our time when they started cooking, it would have taken more than half an hour to cook.\n\nWe also require a time when the movies started. We can guess that is at the beginning of the second row, but we know that it is after the two extra hours preparing food. However, if the movies started at the end of the second row, then it took them about half an hour to finish the food.\n\n### Input1: The problem is given in terms of hours. We will have to convert the hours to minutes and back to the hours. If we do not add the missing zero, then the result will be one hour and five minutes.\n### Response1:\nJoseph and 5\n### Explanations1:\nJoseph's time is one hour.

So, this should give you away that it\u2019s referring to the first drink.\n2. You would need to start with the answer (43 g).\n3. You find in the first drink it has 250 gr, which is the 12-ounce it gives you in part A. Then from that, you know it has 20 g of caffeine which then you can take to the second drink which states it has 3 times more cffeine, which would make it the 25 g.\n4. Then from that you go to finding the size of the second drink. This you can find from the wording that states \u2018second drink(2 oz.)\u2019\n5. Now you know you only have to figure out the last drink of his. So you take caffeine=12*20+12*3 =63g caffeine\n6. Then you take caffeiene=3 times bigger meaning (250+3*250)=750 gr.\n7.

{"text": "52\n\n### Input; It seems that the answer to our riddle is 3, but you are right if you think the answer is actually A: 33. Let's explore this puzzle in greater detail.\n\n### Direction:Solve the riddle below.\n\n### Context:In a certain city there are people of three nationalities; English, French, and German. All births and deaths average out to one per day and all marriages average out to four per day.  Whenever a nationality has more than half its people married, it will begin a new war. Wars end whenever any two of the nationalities agree that peace will be restored.\n\n### Question:When did any nationality ever have a war?\n\n### Rationale; In order to solve the riddle, we must first determine how many marriages occur in a year if no marriages occur in any given month.\n\n### The first step is to observe that a marriage means that a pair of people of the same nationality gets married. This means that after each marriage, there are four remaining people on the same spot. We can make the hypothesis that every married couple will be the same nationality.\n\nWe then find 3(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) and 4(1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128 +256 ) which tells us how many marriages are there per day for each nation and we add them together.\n\nWe must sum up 7+16. We divide 42 by 2 to get that the answer is 5.1 because they sum up to 256 and 5.1+5.1=25.2 and we divide both sides by 2 and 5.1 appears. Because we get two 5.1's we divide them to get 2.55 and we divide both 2.55 by 2 and the answer is 1.275, which we write as 3.75. This means that one day in the year they hold 9.5 marriages, or we subtract the answer and we get 4.5.

From this information, we can also identify the percentage of tomatoes the birds ate, which we will use for calculations in the next step.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the values needed using the numbers provided.\n\nThe birds took 19% of the tomatoes. This can be calculated as the total number of tomatoes, 127, times 0.19, to give 25.73.\n\nThe rest of the tomatoes that weren't eaten were given to Haruto's friend, which we will assume represents 40% of the total tomatoes, or 49.35.\n\nThis leaves Haruto with 127 - 25.75 - 49.33 = 31.88 tomatoes.

{"text": "The correct answer is D: 26 miles.\n\n### Rationale behind the correct answer\n\nIn this question the choice of answer is supposed to be calculated based on the given question. The given choice of answer is the total miles Harvey runs in addition to the miles his friend Sam runs. Harvey runs 8 more miles than Sam. So to calculate the total miles Sam runs we have to subtract 8 from 12. Thus the total miles Sam runs is 4 miles. 8 miles more than Sam's total running miles or 12 \u2013 4 = 8 miles. Thus the total number of miles both Harvey and Sam run is Harvey's 8 miles in addition to Sam's 4 miles. So, the total miles both Harvey and his friend Sam ran is the total of 12 and 10, or 12 +10 = 22 miles. To get the total number of miles from 22 means we have to multiply the number of miles by 22 / 2 = 11 miles. There are 11 extra miles to run. Thus, the total miles both friends run is 11 miles. \n\nSo, the total miles both men run is 11, which means that the total miles both friends ran is 11 times 2 miles, which equals 22 miles. \n\n### Additional Notes\n\nIn an actual question it is not given that Harvey's friend's name is Sam. It's not necessary to give too much detail as long as the content supports the response. Additionally, the response could simply be that Sam's friend was an accomplice for a crime. This response will be deemed wrong. Another important piece of advice is that response should have a certain level of clarity. The response in this problem has not been clearly explained.\n\nIn addition, the response to this question should have been that Harvey was a criminal. This response would not have been deemed incorrect. The response could have been that Harvey and his family are victims of theft. This response wouldn't matter either since Harvey ran more than ten miles.\n\nFor 12th grade the following should be taken into account.

As he said he was going to buy 100 lotto  tickets so he can have a chance to win, it means he doubled the number of the ticket he was going to buy for an 80% increase. We know it could be hard to get it right but he is  sure he can predict what will happen since he knows 50% of 20% is 10%\nSo 200 tickets, 20% for winners, 10% is 20 so 1/5 of those tickets are 20  so we just multiply it to 500000 by 5/200\nThen we have double since it was the first line. \u201c20% of winners with 5 dollars, which means its 15.  so 5000+15=5015\nNext he says he will multiply it to 1/5 since he says its 5000 winners now and 15 for another sum and we don t have to double it again.

{"text": "Tony will have driven 25 miles when he is halfway (30/2) through driving around for his three errands.\n\nNote:\n1. Tony's task and the three errands to be performed are in the past tense; hence, he has already completed the tasks; i.e., he has \"run his errands\" and driven those required miles.\n2. The question doesn't specify the driving distances in hours, which suggests that Tony uses miles (i.e., yards) to travel those distances. (He does so when he travels to his doctor's appointment which he specifies as \"5 miles.\")\n3. Tony drives 10 miles \"to get groceries\". Assuming he does so in a 10-mile radius around his home, he won't complete his errands \"in a day.\" (The text says he \"needs to\" complete the errands in a day)\n4. Hence, the given task specifies that Tony drives 10, 15, and 5 miles, respectively, to (a) get groceries, (b) get a haircut, and (c) go to his doctor's appointments. The distances indicated for each errand are in miles, since they are in a radial layout around his home (not necessarily in a linear layout)\n5.

From the question, you know the ball will fly for 8 seconds and from the premise that \"Belinda can throw the ball at a speed of\" 20 feet per second, which means that Belinda is throwing the ball with a velocity of 20 feet per \"second\"--so, you don't need to add a \"per second\" sign in your answer, because there's already an \"of\" statement in the question itself, which already signified that the object(s) is traveling for a certain duration. \n\nTherefore, you only need to determine \"the amount of time it will take the border collie [to] catch up to the ball.\" By looking at the question, you can see that the dog catches up after \n5 seconds, which means that after it [the dog] catches up after 5 seconds, it will take 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, etc. for it to overtake the ball and catch up again.

However, the number of hairs required to bend will vary with the haircut, as the hair follicles on the vertex will be longer, 8 times longer, which will require more hair follicles to bend the hair completely to avoid breakage, so we can remove follicles by using 8 times of the number of hair follicles in hair per side, or 4 hairs per side from that point.\n\n1) It is easy to see in one year there are 366 days and 52 weeks, and if it's a little more than a year, add 0.6*52 weeks.\n2) According to the question's setting, the hair extension can be assumed to be from 47 to 2 years, so in the image in the test, there are 15,005 (47*366*2) to 15,011 (2*366*52) hair follicles.\n3) Hair follicles can also be represented by the sum of its number and the number of years, that is, 15,050 + 15,080 = total 30,130 times.\n4) The sum of 30,140 times gives 89,550 units (30,14 x 89550 units).\n5) The sum of 82,400 gives 2,205 x units 749,660 hair follicles (82400 x 270", "answer": " 8"}

Since 1.5 is larger than 17.3, then the total amount of apples is 17, but not taking into account 1. 1 times 7 is 7, but.75 is bigger than 7, so we have to keep it. 1/17 doesn't equal to 0.  0.75 times 17 is 12.5 so it is equal to 13.5. \n\n### Demostration:\n\nInstruction: In this task, you must write your response to each question asked.

What do you have in common with them? Choices: \nA: They also have a cranky sister B: Have a cranky mother C: Married soon D: Haven't been married E: Go to church together\nRationales:\n\n* If the question asks \"What do you have in common?\", the answer would be between choices D and E. \n* Option A can be eliminated because it doesn't provide a significant amount of information about the question.\n* Option B (married soon) describes a shared experience between the subject and the person next to them. Therefore, it doesn't provide context for the question.\n* Choices C (a cranky mother) and D (a cranky sister) could both be reasonable responses to the question. A cranky mother is unlikely to attend a wedding, so choice D could be the better answer. \n* It would seem that choice E (go to church together) could also be the correct answer. However, there isn't any explicit context that points to someone who goes to church.

We can see that the question asks about Ivan's bird feather's capacity, which we can infer means the number of individual birds that it feeds. Now we must identify the correct amount of birds fed per week, which is 9.\n\nHow can we do this?\n\nIn the scenario provided, Ivan's bird feeds is capable of feeding 14 birds every week. However, it is only able to do so because a squirrel steals half a cup a bird seed every week. The squirrel stealing bird feed only occurs every week, implying that the 14 birds are fed on a weekly basis.\n\nIf we continue to use this reasoning, we can deduce that the bird feeder is capable of feeding only 9 birds per week.\n\nHowever, the question isn't asking how exactly many can the bird feeder feed, but rather, it's asking how many individual birds are fed each week.

We can figure out how much time everything will take by figuring out the total number of minutes a certain task will take. Then we can multiply these times by their respective number times and add all of this together to get the total number of minutes it takes to complete each task.

A store is selling these cleats in multiples of six.  A customer needs six extra small cleats, one medium, two extra large. If each pair of cleats costs $25, how much does this order cost in total?\n\n### Solution:The total cost of the order is $123.\n\n### Rationalization:To solve this problem, we must first take into consideration that the customer needs six extra small soccer cleats, one medium cleat, and two extra large. We can immediately see that there is no such soccer cleat that is extra small and large. Therefore, the extra small and large sizes that the customer asks for must be split up into two groups, small and large. For example, one clean of medium size should be split into two groups, one small size and the other group large.  We also must consider that each soccer cleat costs $10, and that the soccer cleats are being sold in multiples of six, so that all the shoes must be divisible by six, and if they are not, some of the numbers must be 0 and some must be remaining units.

A. 21.76 B. 23 C. 22.5 D. 18.95\"\n\n### Response A. 2176\n\n### Excarnation: The first thing to realize is that 142 represents the amount of money in question and that 217.6 represents 21.7% of 141. We know this because we are asked for which of D., B., and C. is 22.5%. This gives us two choices to consider, D and B. In order to calculate the third option, C., we need to understand the math behind the problem. At first glance 142 and 16% do not appear to be proportional, but we do in fact find that they are because 13% = 142 / 100 = 1.42. This is where we will discover that the correct answer is indeed option C. 13% = $18.95. This is because by multiplying the multiplier (16%) by an additional (1%) we get an additional $18.92 ($18.95 with 1.01 * 16% ). Since we started with $18.9 and ended with $18.5 ($21.76 - $21.72) we can see that the answer to the problem is $18.9. Option C. is our answer.\n\n\n### Input \"Which of the following has the highest percentage as a ratio to itself? A. 9: 23 B. 17: 20 C. 49: 27 D. 33: 50\"", "answer": " 290"}

If the word \"number\" appears at the beginning of the statement, then the problem is about choosing numbers. \n4. If the word \"amount\" appears at the beginning, then the choice is about quantities. \n\n##### Demonstration with rules:\n\nInput: 5 squirrels gathered 575 acquisitions. If each squirrell needs 130 seeds to get through the cold season, how many additional seeds do each squirrel need in order to collect?\n\nThe first thing to take into account is that the scenario is about squirrels. \n\nWe then eliminate the first part of the question that indicates that \"5 squirrels have collected 575 seeds.\" From this line, we can infer that 5 squirrel should have gathered 575 sectors. As we'll see below, we can eliminate these two statements because, while true, they are not relevant to the question at hand. \n\nThe next statements in the question that seem relevant to the scenario are: \"\"If each squirrel needs to collect 130 sewn, how much more seeds do each squirmel needs to collect?\" After this point, another statement is added: \"5 squirrel gathered 575 seed.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the phrase \"additional\" means an increase of numbers or quantity. \n\n- The first choice \"A: one hundred thirty\" does not reflect the information given, so it should be excluded. \n\n- \"B: more that\" would seem to follow up the phrase \"how much more,\" but it's not mentioned what kind of \"more\" is being referred to (either quantity or numbers).\n\n- The remaining option, C \"more seed\", seems to be the logical answer given how the word \"seventy\" was stated. \"More seed\" seems to be an increase in quantity. \n\nA is eliminated.

{"text": "The answer is 26: 17 (Djibo's age) + 5 (the number of years ago) + 17 (the sum) - 1 (the age that was subtracted) = the answer\n\n### Additional Details:\n\n1. The problem is presented with the following words: Djibo is 10 years old. Five years from today, Djibo will be 20 years old. What will be Djibo's age five years from now? The first sentence states \"Five years from today, Djigbo\u2026will be 20 years of age\", and the second sentence states \"Djibo is now 10 years old\". From this, we see that there will be five years from today before Djigbo is 20 years old, and the problem asks us to find out \"What will be Djibo\u2019s age five years from today?\"\n2. To figure out Djibo\u2019s current age, the question uses the following sentence: Djibo added his current age with his sisters current age. From this, we know that Djibo currently is 10 (10 + 10 = 20) years old, the same age as his sister, and 5 years ago he added the sum of his sister's and his age to find out what his age will be in 5 more years.\n3. Given this information, we can use simple arithmetic to calculate Djibo\u2019s future age. The above formula requires us to know Djigbo\u2019s age five years ago. We know that Djigbo is 17 years older 5 years from now, so we can put 17 into the formula, which is equal to his age five years from now in 2026 (10 + 5 + 17 = 32). His sister\u2019s current age must then be equal to 26 years old in 2021.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Djibo is 26 years old today.\n2. 10 years ago Djibo was 2 years old.\n3. Five years ago Djigbo was 6 years old. We know that Djibo\u2019s and his sister\u2019s ages were being added, so if Djibo is 6 years older in 26 years", "answer": " 28"}

{"text": "Each top cost $10.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. In this question, we have a scenario where Ann bought 7 pairs of shorts for 70 dollars each, which is supposed to equal 7 x 7 = 77 dollars. However, we know that the first part of the question is wrong, as she bought the shorts for $75. So, when you are dealing with scenarios where some quantities are right and some quantities are wrong, you cannot take for granted that the right quantity will result in the correct sum. Hence, it's good practice to first see what sums up to the amount of money the store should receive for each item based on the right quantities, and then see how that sum is derived from the wrong quantities.\n2. Here, we do the sum for the shorts, which results in 210, in agreement with the total of Ann's investment, which should equal 210 and not 75 because that's the price we were given.  However, 210 = 5 x 7 + 2x10, so we know that the pair of shoes Ann bought was sold at $10 each. Now, we do the subtraction involving the tops bought and we get $50, in agreement with how much the store was making from selling the 3 shirts she bought.\n### Input: A _______ is a type of device that generates very high voltages of electricity. Choices:  A. bipolar junction transistor B: unipolar junction transister C: tunneling tesla D: inverter E: unipolar bipolar transistor\nRationales:\n\n1. In the context of this question, it's reasonable to surmise that the question is referring to a device that conducts electricity. \n2. Bipolar and unipolar refer to the flow of direction of current/electricity.\n3. B: unipolar bipartite transistor is the correct answer. Bipolar refers to uni polar, and a _bipa_ _t_ _r_ _i_ _t_ o _r_ would be unipolar polarized.\n4. However, as per the first sentence, this is a type of device or transistor that generates a very high voltage", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "43 files\n\n#### Rationale\n##### Analysis of choices\n* Choice A: 10\n\nAccording to the second statistic of \"He downloaded 400 files but again realized that of them were irrelevant\", it is impossible for B to leave with 200 files because there were only 400 downloaded in total. He deleted 3/5 of all downloading (400 files) for the second time which is 3 out of 700 files downloaded earlier (800 files from the first time) in sum. Therefore, option A, 10 files are incorrect. \n\n* Choice B: 20\n\nAccording first statistic of \"Brennan was researched his school project and had 800 files to download\" and second statistic of \"After downloading 800 file, He deleted 70%(640 files). So, there are a total of 280 of downloading file can be useful. Then he downloaded another 400 files, he again realized 3/5(400/280) of them are irrelevant.  Therefore, the total number of 3/5 of relevant files should be 120 (280/2.5), which is B, 20.\n\n* Choice C: 80\n\nThere are four times for Brennan to download files and the first two times he deleted 70%. At the third time when Brennan download 400 files he deleted 3/5 which equals to 200. It is not the whole 400 files that are deleted. Since the second time he downloaded the total file is 400 which means at the third time if he deleted 3/4(400/1.5) 200 files should left, 200 files /2 is 100 so the answer is C, 80.\n\n* D: 120\n\nAccorder to the choice B, the second time Brennan downloaded 400 downloaded which he again realized 3% was irrelevant.  The left 640 for second time downloading. It 1.5 times left. So there are four times left. The solution should be D, 120.\n\n### Input :B", "answer": " 400"}

What percentage of all births in the U.s. occurred in 2014?\n\n### Demo : \n\n1. The question asks us to find the percentage of births that occurred in 2024. This necessitates looking at the total number of\nbirths, which is 1,363,463, and comparing it to what was born in 2025. Therefore, the percentage of births in 202.13 is x = $\\frac{x}{1366,415 +100}= 57\\%$\n2. Thus, the correct response is choice D: $57 \\%$.", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "It's 4000.\n\n### Rationale: \nThe question involves figuring out how many square feet Benedict's house is after accounting for known information.   \n\n1. The first sentence establishes that Benedict's house measures 4 times less than 600, which is the difference between Kennedy's house and 600.   \n\n**4 x (400 - 600) = 4 x 200  =  800  **\n(400-600) is the difference between the two houses, but when factoring in 4, Benedict's house would then measure 800 more square feet less than Kennedy's house.  \n\n2. The second sentence informs us of the square footage of Kennedey's house to further deduce information about Benedict's house's square footage through logic.  \n\n**200 + 1000202**\n(400+400) will increase the square footage of Kennedy's house. This could indicate a relationship between their houses; it could be inferred that Benedict's could be similar to Kennedy's in order for it to measure 4 times less.  \n\n3. We can derive that Benedict's square footage is a multiple of Kennedy's. \n\n**Benedict's house = 1000 \\*?  = 100 x?.**\n\nThe question is asking how many multiple times Benedict's home is Kennedey's home, in square feet. \nThe first equation indicates the square footage of Benedict's house will take the value of a multiple equal to Kennedy's, and the second indicates it will take the value of Kennedy's.  \n\n4. The solution requires multiplying the second equation by itself a few times. However, 100 x 100 is 100 000. The answer to the problem is 4000, which is one fifth and 400 less than 100 \n000. \n\n**100 x 400 = 4000**\n\nTherefore, the answer is 400.\nAnswer", "answer": " 2350"}

{"text": "There are 40 mangoes left\n\nThere are a few things to notice about this problem. The number we need to write is 40, which has four zeros after the decimal place. To solve this problem, we need to add all the numbers that have more than one zero after the decimal point. The total number of mangoes he has is 60, so we need 60. The last number we need to write after the decimal point is 0, so there are only 10 zeros in total.\n\nSince we have to write 60 after the decimal point, we have zero at the first position because we have only one number after the decimal point and one zero after the decimal place. Therefore, we have to move the 5 to the second position, then the 4 to the third position, and the 0 to the last position.\n\nThe numbers that we need to write are the ones that have more than one numbers after the decimal point, so we start from the first position and start writing the number. The number 60 has one number and the number 0, so the first position is filled and we move to the second position. First, we multiply 6 with 4 because 6 * 4 = 24. Second, we multiply 1 with 0 because 1 * 0 = 0. Third, we subtract the first number from the second number and that gives us the result: 24 - 0 = 24.\n\nThe second position is filled and we now move to the third one. The number 20, the one in the second position, has the number 8 after the decimal point because 20 * 8 = 160. The sixth position has zero, but we already needed it at the last position, so we just take 60 - zero = 60.\n\nThe third position is half-filled because we already multiplied 20 with 8. The third position doesn't have a number after the decimal point, but we already have two numbers in the third position, and we don't want to write zero, so we will only write two numbers.

{"text": "### Demostration:\nInput: A: 36 B: 15 C: 12 D: 18 E: 4\nRationales:\n1. We can exclude options 36 and 18. Option B gives the total number of unused crayons. It tells us that Madeline has 5 used boxes and 5 unused boxes. If we multiply those two total number, it will equal to 15. But, 2/3 of options 2 and 3 only tells us that she has 9 unused crayons total. Therefore, the answer can be ruled out.\n2. Option C has the same logic. First, we count how many boxes Madeline had before she counted the amount of crayons. Then, we divide the amount of unused crayon by the used crayons. In this case, it is 7/12 = 0.583. This means the amount of unused boxes is about 5-8, which is between 5 and 4. Since option C says the answer is 6, it will be ruled out.\n3. Option D is similar to option B. We multiply all the number of boxes left and boxes that are not used. There is 4 total boxes that not used. We can count the used box, we get 3. We multiply 3 and 4 to get 12.

{"text": "Jessica pays $300 more for food and insurance this year to compensate for the increased expenses. She has $300 less for rent, as the rent has gone up by 30% and her expenses are the same in total. Therefore, Jessica ends up with a net profit of $300.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Jessica spent $1000 on rent, $20 for insurance, and $200 on food in the previous year, making her expenses a total of $1220 for the entire year. In the following year, her expenses go from $1220 to $1580, which is an increase of $360. This new value is given, so we can solve for the change by subtracting the two:\n\n$\\$_{current} - \\$_{old} = \\$_{increase}$\n\n2. $1580 - $1220 = $360\n\n3. Another way to look at it is to subtract 200 from 1220, so\n\n$\\$_{old} - \\$_{new} = \\$_{income}$\n\nSubtracting $20 from 200 gives us $180, so\n\n$180 - $20 = $160. In other words, Jessica's income from the extra expenses is $160.\n\n4. There are two parts to Jessica's expenses: rent and food.

{"text": "Answer: C: 2.6 pounds.\n\n### Explanation:\nIn the input, Frank has enough money to get a certain amount of peanuts. Then he can divide it to buy on each time. Frank plans to eat all the peanuts in a week, so he can't buy one time more than it needed.\nOn the other hand, according to the question, the last bill is the twenty-dollar bill, which can be the five, ten, or fifteen-dollar bill. When you get the five-dollar bill, you only have 2 pound left to buy. When you get the ten-dollar bill, Frank would have 1 pound left to buy, and when you get the fifteen-dollar bill, there would be 0.5 pound left to buy so it won't make sense to buy the peanuts. Hence, the twenty-dollar can only be the ten or fifteen dollar bill.\n\nThe remaining money would be divided into the five-dollar, ten-dollar, and fifteen-dollar bills. Here you have to notice that Frank buys the food in the same pound for each price, and it takes 1, 2, and 3 money to buy each pound so the first money would be $7, the next one would be $11, and the last would be $17. However, there is no way to find the number of money Frank still has to get each time he buys the food. So, the best choice is to subtract the 17, 11, and 7 and take the last one to get how much money he has at the end. Then to figure out what's left to buy, we multiply the number of dollars per pound by the money he has at the time to get the total pounds he can buy.\n\nSince he has $4 left to spend, after subtracting 3, 2, and one, he only has 1 money to buy the next pound of peanuts. Therefore, 17 pound would be bought.\n\nTherefore if his total amount of money is $48, the number of pound would be 4.\n\nThe money per pound is $3, so in the next week, Frank would eat 1/4 pounds per day.\n\nHence the answer is c:", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "Nadia used $63.92 to buy the flowers. \n\n### Explanation:The first step would be to set up two equations: one for the number of roses, and the other for the number of lilies.\n\nFrom the question, we know that roses make up 2/4 of the flowers, and that they cost $5 each. \n\nWe can also infer that each flower, whether rose or lily, costs $5+2x, where x is the price difference between roses and lilies.\nTherefore,\n- For each of the 20 roses, $20+2x = 20x + 40\n- For each of 20 lilies, $30+2x = (20/4)x + 60\n\nThe next step would be to substitute the formulas to each other: (20/4 - 2 / (4 x (20/4)). We can do the algebra.\n\n\\[20x - 2 / \\left (\\frac {1}{4} \\right )(20/4)\\]\n\n- 20x - 5 = 10x\n- 5 = x\n\nThe number of roses can now be substituted to the formula for number of lilies: \n\n\\(30+2x - (2/4)(20/4)\\)\n\n\\(3x + 50 - (5/4)(20)\\)\n- 3x + 55 = 220-10x \n\nSince x = 5 and x = (5/4)x, which means x = 1.25\n\nWe can then substitute the value of x:\n\n\\(3.75x + 55 - 10x - 55\\)\n\n\\(35.75x - 40\\)\n\nNow, the price can be substituted into both the sum and the difference:\n\n\\[(35.75 \\times 5) - (35.75 (5/4) \\times 3) = \\$179.25 - 112.5 =  \\$66.75\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[35", "answer": " 250"}

However, there is no mention of what party will host the extra guests. \n\n### Let's say Gloria is not having a party and is just buying a flag for herself, so she only invites 35 guests.\n\nIn order to pay $1 for each party, we must do the following.\n\n1. Divide the number of flags needed by the number of parties.\n2. Multiply with the price of the flag: 22 / 2 = 11\n3. Add 1 for personal flag (Gloria's flag): 11 + 1 = 12\n4. Add the number of flags needed to cover the remaining guests (since we have less than the required guests): 35 / 2 = 22.5  or add one more flag (since 22.5 is not a whole number, so the store won't sell you exactly 22 flags, which makes us go one unit higher than the number of guests we need): 22.5 + 1\n\n5. Multiply by the price again: $5 x 12 = $60\n\n### Here's the solution:\n\n22 / 2 parties = 11 flags per party\n11 flags per party x $5 = $55\n1 flag per Jay = $55 - $5 = $50 (+ Jay's flag)\n1 flag per Gloria = $50 - $5 = $45 (+ Gloria's flag)\n35 / 2 parties = number of guests still not assigned a flag\n\n28 guests remaining x $5 = $140\n\n$60 is all Jay and Gloria spend combined.\n\nA different solution: If we are not limited on party guests, and we have the same setup as before, but we are taking into account that Jay has two parties:\n58 / 2 = 36 guests per party\n58 / 36 = 1.6 flags per guest (let's", "answer": " 12"}

Let n be equal to two for the number of peanuts. \na. n + 1 = number of peanuts in two Wednesdays.\nb. n + 2 = number of peanut for the 1 Friday.\nc. total of n + 1 and n + 2 = 1 Friday and 2 Wednesdays in consecutive 36 weeks. \nd. total of n + number of Fridays with peanut butter = 2 fridays in consecutive 36\ne. Thus, n + 2 =1.\nf. n = 1.\n5. Hence, to find how many peanut sandwiches and jelly sandwich he had he can be deduced as follows:\na. How many peanuts sandwiches and jellies?\nb. How many times he ate peanut butter on 2 Wednesday?\n6. a. Thus, 36 times.\n7. b. thus 18.\n8. Substituting n for 1,\n9. 36 = 18 + 1 + 2.\n10.

Therefore, Jackson's mom packed Jackson 24 peanut sandwich on 36 Fridays and 23 peantuts sandwiches for 23 Wednesdays.\n13. Thus, he a", "answer": " 69"}

We have the following data: employees = 10, value per employee = $20,040 and Emily's salary = $1,061,040\n\nNotice that employees = value per employee x amount of employees. And salary = value per employee x number of employees, so value per employee = salary / amount of employees\n\nIn this problem, Emily's salaries equals employee's income; hence, the value per employee is Emily's salarial income divided by number of employees.\n\nFrom Emily's salarily, we can derive the formula: number of employees * employee's value / number of employees = Emily's salarie.\n\nThen from employee's income, we have the same formula using a variable a, b, and c (employee's salary - amount of employees).\n\nLet's put the numbers we have already identified into the above formula:\n\nNumber of employees = 10\nEmployee's salary = 1,060.040\nEmployee's value = 1060,040/145 = 7,319.52, which is the amount 10 employees should receive together.\n\nUsing the identifications and values given, we can create a formula.\n\nnumber of employees * 7.319,52 / number of employees = $1060, 040\n\nIt's important to use divisor = 1 (i.e. /1) instead of /10, as we have 10 employees instead of 1.\n\n\n### Demand: The first step is to find the amount of money Emily must take from her yearly salary to compensate her employees.\n\n\nWe apply the formula given and apply the values to derive the final sum, which is\n\n$7,319,576, plus the original sum = $1,037,016, plus the original $1060.0", "answer": " 850,000"}

So (43 - 25) divided by 43 is 1.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe store owner buys clothes from a wholesaler at a discount. He adds 20% to the discounted price to determine how much to charge.  If you add 20% to each number in a series, you end up with numbers that are 15% greater than the original numbers.

No, because he adds 20 percent, but to make up for making the original pants, he adds 80 percent to the discounted wholesale price.\n\n### What the student said\n\n> The owner bought the pant for $24 and adds 80 percent of that to get $36. I divided 36 by 24 and I got 1.5 so the answer is $36 the retail price is $36.

{"text": "Ans: Rs 316\n\n### Explanation: Dividing total earnings of S&D between 2, if S sold 6 pairs of shoe he will get 20% of the total earnings = (1/5) * 110 = 20\nSince 1/5*6 = 20 pairs so D will get 30% of the remaining (110 - S*20)% = 30%*90 = 27\n90*(27 + 20) = 1229 so the total earnings =110  + 27 = 137.\nNow S makes Rs 20 and D makes Rs 27, so that D makes Rs = 1700+1000 = 2700 and S earns Rs = 2000 + 1700 = 3700 so the total earnings is given by 13700 which is 3700 + 1000 = Rs 31700.\n\n### Input:'If it rains, we can go in the museum,' I said.

Instead, they called their jails \"gaols\", which was generally a room in the local inn. That being said, these prisoners were called \"gaol-birds\", which meant that their families didn't dare to take care of them, as it wasn't a place to return home from, so people would just abandon them there and go back with no concerns about seeing their prisoner alive ever again.\n\n### Response\n\nSo if we understand that these prisoners are essentially treated as if they were dead to society, which implies they will be thrown aside, then it is natural for the gaol to be in a local inn. To further analyze the question, we understand that the prisoner may be locked up in the local inn. \n\nSo now, the question becomes more complicated. How many gaol-birds can a local inn hold? Obviously, this would vary depending on the size of the local inn. The question can also be transformed into asking how many different \"gaol rooms\" a local inn holds. That being said, it would be impractical and wasteful to take up spaces in the local inn with so many locked up and forgotten prisoners.\n\nInstead, it is likely that a gaol room is only created when several prisoners are needed to be locked up.

{"text": "The total distance walked in boots was 6 miles.\n\n### Rationale: \n\nThe main thing to consider about this question is that, when doing any math problem, the answer should be expressed in words. Let\u2019s look at the question as a conversation.\n\nHim: Did you walk to the store in your boots?\nHer: Yes, I walked 2 miles to get to the store.\n\nHim (cont\u2019d.): How far, in miles did you walk?\nHer: I walked 2 miles, so you should say I walked one mile less than 2 miles, because 1=0.5 (one half of 2).\n\nHim (continuing): And you walked 1 mile less than two more times?\nHer: Yes. I walked 1 mile less and then one mile less and finally I walked 1 mile just to get home because I don't like walking further. That means I walked 1 less than 4 miles, 1 less than 2, and 1 less than 1. So for one mile less than 4, I walked 3 miles and for 1 less than 3 I walked 2 miles and finally for 2 I walked 1 mile. That gives me 6 miles total.\n\nThus, we can understand that what's asked is the mileage from walking to store and back. Using the same idea, we can write a solution for the problem.\n\nThere are 2 miles to and from the grocery store. After walking into the store, he walks one less than 2 (1 less than 2 = 1 mile =0.5) to get back to the store.\nAfter the second store visit, he walks (1 less than 4) of the 4 miles he left in his boots to get back to the 2 miles he spent on the first run. He has left 2 miles, which he walks. This leaves 1 miles in his boots again.\nThen, he walked to the third store, which is 1 less than 6. Using the same formula, after the third run, he is left with 3 miles.\nThen, he has 3 miles left. After he reaches 0, he can\u2019t walk any more; so, 3 \u2013 0 means 3.

Kelsey picked about 28 apples, which gives about 28/28=1; Maggie picked enough to average 30, which gives about ~39/39=1; and Layla picked about 9, which gives us the answer of about 9/about[9 + (28/28) + (39/39)]=[9 + 28/29 + 39/39]/about[39+28/29+39/39]=21/56.\n\n### Input:(15) is a factor of what two?

We know that the question lists possible factors, hence there will be no restrictions on the number of digits in the factors. \n2. We can disregard option A: 9 because it does not have six digits, it has five digits. \n3. We can similarly disregard option B:18 because it has seven digits.\n\nSince both options have less than the required number of digits, option C: 34 is the only option with the correct number of digits.\n\n4. Further, it is unlikely that an integer has only one set of factors. Hence, it is most likely that option C: 3 is the only option with one set of factors.\n5. This is because 3 is the only integer satisfying the following two conditions given that factoring is the only thing that is considered: i. it has at least 6 digits. ii. it has one set of factors. \n6.

{"text": "60% of 240=144\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question requires us to find the proportion of the total food and rent budget to the total budget from which we understand each value.\n2. By the rule of exponents, 10% of 144 equals 144 x 0.10.\n3. Therefore, with those values, 10%: 144 = 0.10:144; 1.44.\n4. So, 10% can be represented by 1.44, and 60% can be represented as 2.4.\n5. With this reasoning, we can determine that 2.4:1 = 144.\n6. We can substitute the values based on the question, and 2.4: 1 = 4.\n7. And there's one more step, and it involves adding percent values to find the total value.\n8. Therefore the solution to the question is: 1 + 4 = 5.\n9. So, Luna's total budget is 240 + 24 = 264.\n10.

The question consists of two aspects: the number of straight paths and the number of straight paths used by one hundred people.\n2. This means that there are two ways of solving the problem: One way is to find the exact ratio of the number of straight paths to the total number of paths while another way is to find the percentage of paths used by one hundred users.\n3. Therefore the answer options are calculated as follows:\n4.

On one day, the distance is how many what? Choices: C A: Miles B: Hours C: Measures D: Weeks E: Feet\nRationales:The question asks for what type of measure one day's distance is half of another day's. Since we already know John walked the same distance on two different days, it's understood that 1 day is 1/6 times as long as the other.\n6. Let's examine the choices A, B, and D:\n6.1. A: Miles - Mile is a unit of distance in the US customary and British imperial units. While John walked the same distance during 2 different days, it was assumed that they are in a single day, making miles an irrelevant choice.\n6.2. B: Hours - There is no relationship between hours and the length of a day.\n6.3. C and D: Measures and Weeks - They have the same relationship which is 1/6 of days in measures, or in weeks. Choice C could be understood as \"1/6 of days\" but the word measure has more to do with a unit of measurement or quantity. As such, it doesn\u2019t fit with the option we are choosing (distance). Since the question involves hours or days, measures can be eliminated. This also rules out E, because feet is a different type of measure.\n\n6.

This is because $42.00/20 = 2.1$. So from this option the answer will be 2.1. \n\nOption D: $40.25\n\nThe answer to this option is 8.75.

A flower bed with dimensions of 4 meters wide and 3 meters long will have a surface area of 12 meters squared. One square meter is 10,000 square centimeters. There is a relationship between the length and width of the bed.\n\nThe length of the bed, 3 meters, is equal to the square root of the width, 1200 inches, which can also be expressed as the square root of 12 m\u00b2. \n\nDividing 1200 by 2 = 600 \n\nThis gives us the width as 600 millimeters or 6 centimeters,\n\nAnd because there are 1000 millimeters to a meter.\n4 x 1000 = 4000 \n\nAnd multiplying by 2 gives you 8000.\n\nSo the dimensions are 6 meters of height and 3 meters of width in order to make a rectangle.\n\n4 x 112 = 448\n\nThen to do the length, 4 x 111 = 444\n\nWe need 4 x 1 = 4 meters to complete the flower bed fencing.\n\n### Input:\"The _________ in the picture below shows the different sides of a triangle.\"\n\n### Response:\"The graphic below shows the different sides in a triangle.\"\n\nInput: This article about a popular film from 1975 will likely answer what type of question?

{"text": "There are a total of 15 dogs at the dog park. It is then reasonable to assume that 5 dogs out of the total of 15 are pointy eared.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nWe can reason from the statements presented. If 1/5 of dogs at the dog park have pointy ears, that must mean that 15 dogs have spot. If this is true, then 5 dogs definitely have pointy ears. We can then eliminate any other choices and mark them as not acceptable. The question does not ask how many of the dogs have ears, but rather pointy ears. To be able to conclude that a dog has pointy ears, we understand that it has to be one that is not spotted, and we know that in order to have pointy ears, a dog must have spot. Since we understand that we can only use a dog which does not have spots with pointy ears, we can eliminate any choice that do not include the dog in its given context.\n\n### Input 2:\n\nRainfall is lightest between November and February and heaviest between August and October. Rounding to the nearest inch, what is the average rainfall in June for a place a hundred miles due south and a hundred miles to the east of a site that recorded 4.9 inches of rainfall during June? \n\n### Response 2:\n\nWe can first determine the range of values for the two given parameters of 100 miles due south and 100 miles to the east from the site that recorded 49 inches. 100 miles south = 75 miles due south. The value of 100 is an integer and is evenly rounded to be. Thus, the range of values for this parameter is from 0-75. 100 east = 300 miles due east. The value of 300 is an integer but is fractional and will be rounded to be 0. This can also be written as (300.0 miles). Using the same principle as for the parameter due to the site having recorded 49 inches of rainfail, the range of values is from 0 to 65.5.

{"text": "In order to calculate the total number of visitors that went to the library that day, you first need to understand that the answer can be found by using the average from each day individually. From the question, we know that the total visitors between Monday and Friday was 200 people (Monday + Tuesday + and Wednesday + Thursday + Friday). To solve this question, we must first solve for each day one by one and find the answer per day, which allows us to then combine each day's answer into a single total answer and thus find our final answer.\n\n### Input for Day 1:\nOn Monday, 50 people went to the library; hence, the average number of people that went to the library over that day is 50/5 = 10. From this calculation we can then compute for the remaining days to ensure that we use the same average.\n### Input for day 2:\nOn Tuesday, 100 people went to the librrary; hence, the average for the number of people that went into the library on that day is 100/2 = 50. \n### Input for all other days:\nOn Wednesday to Friday, 20 people went to the libary; hence, the number of average people that went during day is 20/3 = 7.5. All of these average numbers can now be combined into our final and complete answer.\n\n## Final Question:\nHow would I know if I have made a mistake in a problem involving fractions?\n\n## My response on the correctness of the final answer\nTo sum up my findings, I arrived at a final answer of 96.75 which can be calculated as follows:  \n### Step 1 - First we find the lowest common factor; in this case, the only common factor between the denominator and numerator is 4.  \n 1/16 + 3/8 + 4/5 + 4/2 + 3/2 + 4/7 + 2/3 + 2/7 + 7/14 + 3/14\n### Step 2 - By dividing the numerator and denominator by this lowest common factor 4, we then find the total.\n 8.53 + 13.5", "answer": " 250"}

The key to solving this problem is to examine and interpret the clothing store\u2019s sales information.\n2. We know that every pair of jeans is sold at twice the price of a shirt. We are told that the cost of a shirt is $10 and the cost of two pairs of jeans is $20. We know that there are 10 pairs of pairs of jeans, so we also know that the cost of the 10 pairs of and jeans is $2.\n3. We can further simplify this information by dividing $2 by $10 to discover that each pair of jeans costs $20 or double the price of one shirt.\n4. All of the options are incorrect, except for option A. We also know that each shirt costs $1 per shirt, and that 20 shirrs were sold.

This question is asking how many more sandwiches Samson ate on Monday compared to Tuesday. \n\nWe start by recording the information given using the information table which says:\n```\nSandwiches\n3 Sandwiches at lunch\nTwice as many at dinner\n```\n1. We write down information 1, which is the lunch sandwiches, as 3. \n2. We use division to solve the multiplication equation from information 2. It takes us back to multiplying by 2. This result is the number 6.\n3. We add 6 to 3 to get 9. Since the initial amount in information 1 is 3, the difference between the amount before and after eating the added number is 6. \n4. This means, when we plug in 3s for 1 and 9s for 2, we get this: \n```\n3s (Original amount) + 9s (Added number) = 9 (Final amount)\n\n```\nIn other words, we know that 3 + 9 =6 since 6 is the calculated amount, which is the difference between the initial amount (which is 3) and the final amount (9).\n\nThis shows us that the correct answer to the question is that Samson ate 6 more meals on Monday compared to Tueaday.\n```\nA \n+  \nB\nDifference between A and B is D = C.\nThe Answer is D.\n```\n\n### Input\nInput: You are trying to determine what country someone is from by the way they describe something.

{"text": "The play was performed by 40 actors, who had a break of about 20 minutes each between scenes. There were 2 scenes in a half-hour show. Therefore, the play had a total of about 480 minutes of entertainment. This was equivalent to the two nights (2 days) that Lana and her friends spent viewing the play. Since the total number of cars was 700 and it took two daytime nights to attain the number, it's logical to conclude that there were 1400 cars at the end of each night. And to figure out the quantity of vehicles that were put into the parking lot each day, we need to find the difference between the quantity of vehicles in the front parking and at the end of the night. That figure, minus 1400, is the answer of 1080. \n\nRationales: When given a scenario of Lana and her friends going to a theater to watch a play for the weekend, we need to determine how many more cars were packed into the parkings lot. We start by identifying what the question is asking for. We can tell by using the words \"live show\" that the play was not on film, and since Lana saw more cars in the back parking lot than in the front lot, it indicates that the ticket counter was in a different location from the front parking lot, hence we know there would be a greater demand and quantity of tickets at the back parking lot. This means there were probably additional vehicles to accommodate both locations and that more cars were probably packed into the back parking lot, which is what we need to figure out using the information provided: 1: the number of cars at the show; 2: how many times it took to get about 700 from the number of cars in the front parkin lot, we know this was two because there were two nights of entertainment.\nThe equation we can use is: Total no of Cars= (front park no of cars) * (time for 1.9 to fit cars in the park)\nSince we know that the time for half the number of cars in either lot to fit in the lot is about 20 minutes, the quantity for the front lot would be a little less than half that quantity (about 1050 less).

Choices: A : slow B: rapid C: heartbeat D: old man E: beating\n\n### Response\n\n### Solution\n1. The correct answer is \u201csluggish\u201d, considering the simile that was used to describe the bus and the negative connotation it contains. The simile contains the words \u201cslow\u201d and \u201clike\u201d, therefore, the answer should be \u201csluggish\u201d.\n\n\tSluggish means slow and sluggishly means at a slow pace. The simile that was used in the paragraph compares the new bus with an old man\u2019s heartbeat. The old man\u2019s heart beats at a slow pace. Hence, \u201cslow\u201d fits well with \u201clike\u201d, the words that is used to make the comparison.\n\t\n2. The correct answer is E: \u201cbeating\u201d. \u201cBeating\u201d indicates movement or action. The paragraph describes the passengers who were waiting for the new bus were also waiting for its arrival. The correct answer is therefore \u201cbeating\u201d.\n\n\tBeating heart means a heart that is constantly moving with life and is beating, hence \u201cbeating\u201d can be used in the sentence.\n\t\n\n\n###Input\nWhenever I'm in a car that's going fifty miles an hour, there is no one behind me in the lane.

Multiply the previous calculation by 10, and you get:  750 x 10 =7500 minutes = 1250 minutes \n\nIn otherwords, it takes him 2 hours to build 10 chairs.\n\nTherefore, 8 hours is 1/3 of a day.

{"text": "He has 16 cards left.\n\n### Justification:Baseball cards are always separated into two parts: The front of the card and the back of the card. The front will always display the picture of the player in the game and other information such as their number on the team, league they play for, the card\u2019s value, etc. As such, the back will display information that\u2019s been put there to add value to the card. These could be items such as year that the player was drafted, how many appearances, personal life info, etc. What the question states is that Malcom has 8 cards more than Brandon, meaning his cards have the information about a total of 8 players, while Brandon\u2019s cards only have information of 8 players. However, Malcom gives half of the cards to Mark, meaning all the information that was previously stated in the back of the cards stays on the front of half of the cards. As such, each player card now shows 4 player information instead of the original 8, giving the total number of cards with player information a total of 16 cards (instead of 20, which was the original total number of cards Malcom had). This means that his current total number of cards is 16.

Choices:  A. fast  B. slow  C. reliable  D. cheap\nRationales: When it comes to playing online games, watching online videos or any other activity that takes the majority of bandwidth, the speed is a factor that is important. Bandwidth is how much data can pass through an internet connection in the unit of time.\nSpeed is considered a main factor in an internet connection because the majority of the data passes through the system in that period.\nTherefore, the choice that signifies a fast internet connection is A: fast bandwidth.\nAnswer: A. fast\n\n### Challenge Choices:\nInput: Differences between the United States and India are many, but these countries are united in having which three of the following in common.

{"text": "He gets 30 free throws (17 * 5).\n### Explanation:\nThe question requires that we count the number of free throws John gets if he plays in 20 games. \n\nIt states that there are 5 fouls per game on average, but as the percentage of games John plays in is 80%, we know that he plays in half of them (40% * 80%=40%). \n\nSo for each of these games, he gets an average of 5 fouls, meaning that he gets about 5 free throws every game if he plays in these ones. 40 games are played in all, so he will get 40 free throws if he plays in the 40 games he attends.\n\nTo find the number of total free throws he gets, we multiply 40 by 5 = 200. He has 20 out of every 20 games, so 19 games per game, so we multiply 19 by 80 = +1520.\n\nFinally, we add 1520 and 200 to get a total of 1720 free throws he will have taken during the season if he plays in every game.\n\nHis free throw percent is 70%, so we multiply 1720 by 0.7 to 1202.\n\n### Input (same as above):John's team plays 80% of its games (same as before).  What percent of games does his team win if the team wins half its games?\n\n### Answer: 50% (1202/2404)\n\n### Explanatiom:\nTo determine what percentage of games his team will win, we know his team wins every other game.  It has a chance of winning half its games if it plays every game, so we just add 0.5 to 0.5 to get 1.\n\nSince each game his team plays in, John plays, which is why we divide 2404 by 2 to get 1202, his total free throw attempts during this season. \n\nBecause 80% of games is 20, they play 80% of their games, so his team plays 20 out of", "answer": " 112"}

{"text": "$10\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales:\n1.

The options give us 3 choices: - $25\n- $10\n- $15\n3. Although $25 seems quite likely, we need to consider what the other person's initial amount of money is and what Lucy has after, since if Lucy now has $25 she would have more, contradicting what's said in the problem. \n4. If the other person only had a couple dozen dollars, which is $10, the choice doesn't make much sense after Lucy ends up with $15 so option $25 shouldn't be chosen.\n5. Option $10 answers the question completely satisfactorily. \n6. The other choice that could be considered as a reasonable solution is $15, since Lucy and Linda now have $10 each and Linda originally had $10.\n7. However, as the problem states Lucy had double Linda' money, Linda' starting amount would have to be at a minimum $40. But after Lucy gives Linda that amount Linda would now have $45 meaning she doesn't only have double the starting amount, but also $5 more. This doesn't make sense either because it's unlikely Lucy would have the same starting amount as Linda for a purpose like this, given that he has $20, which would require some sort of addition.\n8.

{"text": "Caleb spent $12 more money on ice cream than frozen yoghurts. Caleb spent a total of $76 buying the 10 cartons. Caleb spent $88 buying the 4 cartons. So to spend a total of $78 he would have to spend $86 more on ice cream. $86 - $88 = -2, which is not a positive number, so $86 - $12 = $74\n\n### Rationale:The two variables, x and y, represent the price amount of each item bought. Therefore, to answer this question, we'll have to get the difference between the values. The formula for difference between positive numbers is $(x-y)...$\n\nLet x = the amount the ice cream was bought and x = $4 Let y = the amount of frozen yogurt bought and y = $1 The value of x is more so we have to minus the value of y to get the answer. In this case, the question asks how much more ice cream than fro-yo Caleb bought. The amount of money Caleb spent on ice cream is $x in this case. Therefore, it could look like this: $x-y(since y is the value of how much frozen yogurt he bought).\n\n$4-1=$3\n\nIn this case, $4 is more than $1 so $4 - $1 would equal to $3. So $3 is $12. To make this correct, we have to subtract the value of y from $x, so we do: $x - y, which is $4 - $1. We can only take out a positive number when they are subtracted like this.  $4 - $1 = $3", "answer": " 36"}

He had the problem of how to identify an appropriate temperature range with respect to a given temperature, which was to what? Choices :  A: decrease B: rise C: grow D: shrink E: fall   Rationales: The question is asking for the reason for monitoring and adjusting the chemical levels that affected oven temperature in the first place. \n\n- Options B, C, D, E are out of consideration.\n\n- Out of the remaining three options, option C: grow, appears to be contradictory to the scenario's objective. The question of \"identifying an appropriate temperature range\" relates to lowering the temperature, not raising it.\n\n- Options A: decrease and B: rise are both viable options. However, as far as our knowledge goes, chemical levels wouldn't be adjusted to achieve lower temperature results, as this would make monitoring the temperature necessary in order to keep it. Therefore, the answer should be either B: rise or C rise.\n\n- Since the rise option is repeated, we can say that choosing it to be D: shrink is incorrect.\n\n- From here, A, B and C all appear to be reasonable choices. However, based on the wording of the original question, increasing the temperature by \"growing\" the chemical levels doesn't appear to make sense as this would make the temperature rise. \n\n- This prompts us to rule out B: rise. Since the goal is to identify the range of appropriate temperatures, and A: grow directly contradicts it, the conclusion can be drawn that C: grow is also incorrect.\n\n- We are left with A: decrease and C: grow, but A: decrease sounds more feasible because the question is asking what to what, which", "answer": " 200"}
{"text": "If Lee mowed 16 different lawns and he got a tip of $10 from 3 of the lawn customers, then he mowed 19 lawns total and received $90 in tip money. Since he earned $33 from mowing one lawn, he earned $90 in tip  money from mowing 3 different lawns. \n\n### Rationales:Since Lee only mowed 16 and he mowed one lawn at a cost of $33, we know that Lee mowed 15 lawns for a total of $495 (33 x 15). We also know that he received $90 in tips for mowing 3 lawns (one for $10 and two for $9). Based on these two amounts, we know Lee earned a total of $33 + $90 = $123 that week for mowing lawn.\n\n### Note:\n\n1. The student did a great job at solving the question. \n2. There are some minor errors to improve on. Specifically, there are a few typos to be fixed and pronouns/subject verb agreement issues. \n3. Below are a list of the minor corrections the student needs to fix so as to improve their work.\n\n* The first sentence has typos. The student should capitalize \u201cLee\u201d, the word \u201cmowed\u201d and should change the word \u201cand\u201d to the word \u201cas\u201d. \n* The student\u2019s math in the second sentence is correct, but it can be improved by putting an \u201cequals sign\u201d between \u201c19\u201d and \u201cand\u201d\n* The student's use of pronouns can also be improved. The pronoun \u201cthese\u201d should refer to the subject \u201cLee,\u201d so the student\u2019s math should be: \u201cSince Lee mowed 19, and\u201d\n* When the student writes \u201cand received $90 in...\u201d, the reader might think that the student means to say \u201c16 different lawn customers\u201d, but since the sentences end in question marks, the reader should not assume the student implies that Lee mowed 3 lawns for each of the 3 different customers.

Option C: <1 year could be correct if it means less than one, but it would only be applicable if there are two bull markets happening at the same time and both happen in one year; it seems unlikely that two bull markets would happen at the same time. \n4.

If there are 6 kids in the class, then one of them is in the canteen and 2 of the missing are present as well, which means that 7/14 of the students are in the cantee.  \n\nSo the most straightforward way of solving it without any trial and error:  \nFor 1/10 kids are missing:  \nIf there are 10 kids in the class who are actually missing, then 1/5 of the canteen will be full.  \nIf there are more kids present and then subtract that number from 10, there should be 5 of the students in the canteen, which means that 6/14 of the kids (if the original count was 53) are missing.  \nIf there is 11 of the original students (who were missing) in the class, then 1/9 students are in the canetee so far.  \nIf there were 17 missing kids, then 2 of those kids are present so far, which means there are 15 student missing in the canetee.  \nIf there 21 of the original 32 missing, then 12/22 of the canetee are present so far. \n \nThis is just a simple way of using the original percentage to understand how many are still missing.  \nIn the end, it should be easy to", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "The total time the bus driver had to allot in a single trip would be 9 hours.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. Let's use the assumption that the travel distance (from the starting point to the destination and back) is the same as the travel time (from the starting point) + (from the destination) + time spent at destination. Thus, (55 miles) + (55 miles) = (55 miles)\n\nThe above can be rearranged in the following manner, \n\n25 hours = 55 miles\n\n2. The time spent at the destination is 2 hours. Thus, 25 hours - 2 hours = 23 hours\n\n3. The bus driver is assumed to drive 1 mile for every 2 minutes he spends for the entire journey (1 minute per mile), while for the first 25 miles, the bus will only require 23 minutes per mile. However, for the final 30 miles or beyond, it will take 30 minutes per mile (total amount of time: 30 minutes * 30 miles = 1/2 hour, rounded to zero). Thus, \n\n23 hours = 55 minutes (first 25 miles)  x 1 mile = 25 hours\n\n1/2 hour = 30 minutes (the final 30 miles)\n\nMultiplying the first expression (in hours) by two (hours) gives (55 minutes) * 2 = 55 minutes\n\nCombining it with the earlier expression (in minutes) (23 hours) * 7 hours (per day) = 65 hours + 55 minutes\n \nMultiplying the combined expression (65 hours + 7 hours = 72 hours) * 3 equal to 216 hours or (23 hours*730 minutes) * 7 hours * 3 equal to approximately 60 hours and 45 minutes\n\nAfter rounding down the last expression up to the nearest whole number, the total time for the entire bus journey would come out to be precisely 3600 minutes aka 60 hours or 60*60=3600\n\n \n  \n\nAnswer for the final question:", "answer": " 6"}

Option A: game is an event that has a high chance of a microphone boome being used for it, but there are many different types of sports games such as basketball, hockey, football, soccer, and more. It doesn't specifically mention using the microphone boome to cover a specific sports game, so this could be one of many different sporting events rather than just the game being mentioned.\n4. Option T: Competition is used as a place where athletes compete, but it doesn't specify that a microphone boome will be used in it unlike with the aforementioned option that doesn't mention the exact game type.\n5. Option D is the Olympics, and this is when athletes from all over the world come together and compete; this event would most likely be the type of sports competition that we can imagine a microphone boome covering rather than a sporting event held at a local arena or stadium.\n6.

{"text": "Mark has two pests and they're going to be engaged in a contest. The head start, that the turtle will need so as to tie the hare. The response starts from the assumption that the hare is going to run at a speed of 10 feet per second and that the tortoise is going to crawl at a speed of one foot per second. There\u2019s a 20 foot race between the two pests, so the turtle needs to tie the hare to accomplish this. First, the distance the hare runs in a single second can be found, it's 10 feet. So, 10 feet divided by the time taken by the turtle to crawl one foot. The tortoise crawls one foot per second, so the response is 20. It is 10 for the hare, and 20 for the tortoise. Now, the tortoise needs to run at 10 feet per tick to tie the hare, since the tortoise crawls at the very minimum a foot every second of the contest. Now that the time needed to tie the hare has been determined, the rest of the details regarding the contest can be plugged in to get an answer. At the very minimum, the tortoise will need a head start of 20 feet. However, since 10 feet is the hare\u2019s normal speed, and 20 feet is the minimum head start the turtle needs in order to tie the hare after one second of time, then this means that the head start needed by the tortoise is 10 feet. It's not as many as 20 feet, since the turtle doesn't take 20 seconds; it just needs 20 feet.\n\nOutput:\n> The solution required the following facts: two pets named the hare and the tortoise; that the hare runs at ten feet per second, and the tortoise craws at one foot per second; the size of a contest between the two pets, which is twenty feet long.\n\nOutput:The solution requires the followings in order to get there: two pets, named Hare and Tortoise.

{"text": "He was out $20,050\n\n### Rationale: Since he sold his car \"for 80% of it's value\", we know that it was $20,070, since it had to be a whole dollar amount. We also know what he was able to hagel, so the difference is $2,050, which is what he would end up paying. Then you subtract that $2050 from the price of the car he bought, $30,050 or $29,750.

The party will include a 3-course menu, so every meal would require:\n\n- a serving plate\n- a soup-size dish\n- a salad-size dish\n\nWickham wants to use a new dish for each course, this means he would need a total of:\n\n- 3 * 9 =  27 dishes (27 plates)\n\nNow, if we multiply the number of guests (30) with 1/2, we get:\n\n- 15 guests\n\nHalf of that amount of individuals will have a plus one (15 * 1/2 = 7.5), meaning total is 42.5 people. If we multiply the total number of dishes needed (27) with 42.5, we get:\n - 114.75 dishes (114.7 dishes)\n\nBut there's a catch: it's said that for each course, a new dish will be used, so we can't just use our final number of dishes and call it a day.\n\nSince each course requires a different dish size, and each course has a different number of dishes used (i.e. soup, salad, and main meal), we're going to end up with an extra amount of dishes. This, of course, will vary based on the number of people (the guest count) and their respective \"plus one\" amount.\n\nIn this specific case, there are 42.5 guests, and 3 will bring a \"plus one\". The final total is 45 guests, requiring:\n\n- 65 dishes(114.7 - 114)\n  = (65 - [18 dishes])\n  = 47 dishes.\n\nSince there will be a maximum of three people at the table, even if the host is one of the 3 to have a plus one, this will only leave 3 courses for his table.\n\n3 courses, 3 d", "answer": " 135"}

There are 2 of each gender in each van( so that the total is 14 for all the vans)\n\nGiven these two statements, there are 5 boys for each girl (5x28=140), and 60 boy/60 girls. We want 28 boys/5 boys per 60 girls. So the question is reduced to:\n\n5/28>60/5;\n\nAnswered:28", "answer": " 80"}

All the pigs wake at the same time and start to shovel food. How long does it take for all the pigs to get 3 pounds of food?\n### Response: 35 mins\n### Rationale1. The pigs ate at the same time, so it makes sense that they wouldn't all finish at once.\n### 2. When we look at the number of pigs shoveling, the only ones that change are the pigs that eat. If we know the number of pigs eating, we can subtract 5 seconds times this number to get the duration it takes each of them to eat 3 pounds of food. The pigs that aren't eating would start once all pigs that are eating finish.\n### 3.  The last pig would eat once all pigs have either finished eating or started shoveling, so it's 36 seconds.\n### 4.

{"text": "Jim has 12 Buicks.\n\n## Rationale 1:\n\nTo calculate for any unknown number in a problem, we multiply by its multiplier. \n\nUsing a step-by-step approach, we proceed to calculate the following:\n\n- To find the number of Buicks, we simply multiply the number of Buicks by the multiplier `4`. Thus, 4 x Buicks = Buicks\n- To find the multiplier `3`, we take the equation of: `4 times as many Bucks as Fords`.\n- In this type of equation, we set the number of Ford's equal to 1 so that the variable, `x`, remains x. This tells us that x is equal to `x/4` or 1.25. Then, we find a total of `x/2+1` to get x = 5, thus we set Fords to be equal to `x/2` and Ford = `3`.\n- Lastly, to find the number of Chevys, we set Ford equal to a total of 3 to get Chevys to equal to `6`.\n\n\n## Rationale (2):\n\nThis problem can be modeled by the equation: `x+d=e`\n- Here, x represents the number of Buicks that Jim doesn't have with Chevys.\n- d represents the amount of Buicks that Jim has in excess of 12, and so the difference between `d=x-12+3`, and\n- e is equal to the total number of Chevys minus the total Buicks that Jim has. \n\nThe equation here is solved by graphing: `x+d = e`\n- To do so, we isolate the equation in `d`, and then find the `y-intercept` which is where `y=0`\n- The y-intercept in this case equals `e-d`, which would be `e-9=0`. Thus, `e=9`\n- We know that `d` is 12 as we are given `12+d=e` and `x+12=e-12`\n- Therefore, `x+d = x+12=d=12`\n\n## The solution was created by [Mitchell](https://github.com", "answer": " 220"}

The word \"their\" could refer to the \"children\" or to the \"public school for a long time\". Either way it still fits well with the law given.

It would slide more easily through a crack less than a millimeters wide, giving it the advantage. This is compared to a hand or an arm that would not be able to fit through the crack since in order to do so, both would have to be slender and sharp.

{"text": "When given a math problem, we must take a moment to organize our plan for solving it.\n\nThis question was asked in relation to a porch and its dust particles. \n\nThe context of the question states that Samuel swept the porch, and this implies he collected the dust particles left on the porch, and did not add any. However, there is no explanation about what he did with the dust particles once he swept the porch. So, initially it's unclear how to address this problem.\n\n### Plan:\nConsidering the fact that there were 223 dust partitions left behind, this is clearly significant and relevant information. It allows us to address the problem, which will involve subtracting the number of dust particles before Samuel swept the porchee from the total number of dust particles left behind after he walked across it. \n\n### Step:\nAfter carefully reading through the question and considering the information given, we know that there are going to be additional dust particles left on the  porch after Samuel swept it, so we must subtract the number of dust particles left on the before.\n\n### Step2:\nWe can assume the number of dust particles on the porch before must be smaller than the number of dust particles after since the number of additional dust particles is 223 greater than the number there were prior to Samuel sweeping.\n\n### Solve:\nNow that we have the correct steps, we understand what we need to do.\n\nGiven that there were 2 dust particles on the porches before, we are going to subtract 2 from the number of dust particles.\n\n#### Subtract 2 and you get 3\n\nGiven that we substracted 2 from the original number of dust particles, we should subtract 2 again to further decrease of it.\n\n#### Subtrah 2 and you get... 0\n\nNow that all the dust particles have been accounted for, there are no more left on the porch and we have solved this problem.\n\n#### Answer:\nThere was a total of 310 dust particles on the porcee before Samuel swept it.

{"text": "The answer is 16. \n\nLet us assume that all of the animals on the farm are mammals.\n\nFirst, we know that pigs and cows are mammals, and we know that pigs are part of that group.\n\nThen, we know that goats are mammals and that goats are not pigs, so we know that if we subtract the number of pigs from the number of mammals on the farm that will at least equal three more animals than just pigs. Thus we know that 1 pig = 3 other animals (pigs are part of the 3 animals so we already know that 1 pigs = 2 other animals 3 pigs + 6 pigs + 3 pigs = 12 pigs and 12 pigs = 1 less pig than 13 pigs).\n\nThen, we can subtract that number from what we know is true. When we do that, we know that now we have less than 13 pig, so there are 1 less than 13 and since one pig = 3 animals we now have 8 animals less than the number of pigs and the number of cows are equal since twice the number of cows = 4 more cows = twice the number of crows, so we know that what we have is:\n\n1 pig = 8 animals\n\n2 cows = 6 +2 + 1 cow = 9+cows\n\n9 cows = 9 pigs\n\n1 more cow than 9 cows means 1 more cow has to be 10 cows and since cows = 6 animals, we have half a cow which equals 2 animals in this case which would mean that we know that there is 9 pigs and there are 2 more animals than pigs = 11 pigs and 10 pigs = 10 +1 cow = 2 cow = 3 animals = 3 pigs. \n\nSince we are subtracting 3 animals from 9, we know that 6 + 1 more cow = 2 is wrong and 9 \u2013 3 animals = 7 animals = 8 + 1 more cow means that if we add 2 animals to 56, we know that we are multiplying 7 by 2 to know that we", "answer": " 11"}

Democratization is the process whereby a population moves gradually toward greater democracy. There are, however, a number of ways democracy can actually be undermined, such as where the political institutions of the country are designed to be a major constraint on the influence and power of citizens' collective actions.\n\n### Features\n\nDemocratizing reforms can be divided into two basic stages:\n1) expanding suffrage, and\n2) creating new and better institutions.\nThey include: \n1. Enacting universal legal and constitutional principles concerning citizens' human and civil rights.\n2. Introducing constitutional bans on all state repression of religion and belief, including the freedom to change religion or belief.\n3. Establishing guarantees of an independent and fair judiciary.\n4. Repealing constitutional provisions and laws that authorize political discrimination against, particularly but not exclusively, religious minorities.\n5. Instituting effective property rights protection based on the concepts of 'one person, one vote,' and free and competitive elections.\n\n\n### Examples\n\nExamples of democratic reforms can be seen in:\n\n1. The collapse of the Soviet Union,\n2. The transition from military rule to democracy in Burma,\n3. The struggle for democracy in Tibet, and\n4. Cases of popular protests against military rule and/or repressive authoritarian rulers such as the demonstrations in Iran in 2009\u20132010.\n\n### Difficulties\n\n* the cons", "answer": " 44"}

How much sand will be in the sandbox?\nRationales: Given two dimensions of the sand-box: 4 3/2 feet wide and 8 feet long. The sand-box has a perimeter of 36 feet. A rectangle has two perpendicular dimensions. The length and the width. Hence the width of the sand-box is 10 feet as the sand-box is a square and the length is 8 feet. The perimeter of a circle is always less than the diameter. The diameter is twice the width.The width is 10/2 and is 5 feet. The perimeter is 30 feet (30 = 4 \u00d7 diameter). 30 = 2 \u00d7 (5/2) = 2 x 5 = 10 feet. Hence the sand-box has a width of 5 feet\n\nAnswer: The sand-box has width 5 feet and a perimeter of 10 feet. The area is 20 feet (8 feet by 5 feet). The volume of the sand-box (area X height) is 20 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 840 cubic inches.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "The sheepdog rounded up 81 sheep out of the 81 in the pen. Therefore, only 9 sheep remained and 81-9= 72, of these are outside in the wilderness.\n\n### Rationale:\nThis question was tricky because of its vagueness, but it can still be answered if we understand percentages well and apply the correct formula in the given condition. \n\nAccording to the problem, sheep rounded up by a dog equates to 90% of them, and the remaining 10%, which is 8 out of 81 sheep, are wandering off into the hills. 90% of sheep is 73, which we can infer with a simple percentage calculation 73/81=0.9.\n\nHowever, we don't know how to account for the 8 remaining sheep, but it's important to note that they made up 10% of the original number. So out of a total number of 81 sheep in a pen, 8 sheep made up 10%, or.1. This means the remaining 8 sheep are out in the wiiilderness, and the next step is to subtract 8 from 81 sheep in total, which leaves us with 81+72= 143 sheep. This number is the total number of sheep in Carla's sheep pen. \n\nLastly, we can use the following formula:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone\" alt=\"81 sheep\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3-us-region-west-2/assets/places/3051831539/1993864947-f2a99da851-10.png\">\n\n<img class=\"\" src=\"https://s1.wpimg.pl/387299351/aA7XDVfLb_400*400.jpg\" alt=\"8 sheep in the wild\">\n\nThus, there are a total of 8 sheep scattered in the hills, and 143 sheep in the pen.\n\nAnswer:143 sheep in pen, 8 sheep outside.", "answer": " 9"}

The cost for using Coco's oven is given in this problem as $2.40 per hour, which can then be applied as a cost of $0.20 for every hour of using it.\n2. The oven is stated to have a consumption rate of 75 kWh (kilowhat-hours).\n3. It is known from the information given that the oven requires a cost of $10 for every 5 hours in use.\n4. Therefore, the cost for using an oven for a total of 75 hours would be $1,000.\n5. However, the oven has a consumption of 2.4 (two-point-four) kWh per hour.\n6.

He felt betrayed and was what? Choices: A: devastated B: stabbeted C: angry D: disillusioned E: disappointed\nRationales: First, we determine that the subject feels betrayed since he feels a certain degree of deception about his friend. This may result in a feeling of betrayal, making option D: disillusionment, possible. After all, a person will feel disillusioned if they believe that their trust will never be regained. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend turns out not being guilty and is truly being honest, then the subject may still feel let down by the relationship, but there would be no betrayal, which is associated with a lack of trust. He could, therefore, feel either of the other two emotions.\n\nWith these points in mind, we can eliminate options D: disillusion, C: angry and E: disappointed. \n\nEliminating options, we can see that there are only two possible answers A: devastated and B: stabbet. Choice A: devastated is ruled out because although betrayal is associated with deception, \"devastation\" is more akin to shock and surprise.\n\nThis leaves us with option B: stabbet: feeling betrayed is synonymous with feeling stabbed in the back.

Also, the wording implies the dessert already had the promised \"second helping,\" which would have been served already \"made with a what.\" \n\nB: excessive amount of anything could be harmful to health, but there is no indication of an excessive amount in the dish before it was served. \n\nC: If the dish was good and everyone loved it, it is likely that the food it was made up of was healthy. \n\nD: ingredient known can refer to components that have a negative effect on health. \n\nE: nutritious meals would be beneficial to healthy, so it would be an odd choice as the harmful component.\n\nSince the question doesn\u2019t specifically say what ingredient caused harm, but rather asks for the type of ingredient, we can conclude that the word choice would be D: ingredients known to cause illness.\n\nAnswer: D: ingredient (s) known to cause illness\n\n### Contradiction:\n### The following is the reasoning by a student who got the last question wrong: \u201cThe student that got answer A to 8th question also got the answer D in yesterday's practice.

The IF-THEN format allows you to quickly solve a problem by doing the simpler part first and working towards the compound part.\n\n### Output:\n\n1. The question asks how long it will take Fernanda to finish six audiobooks, and we need three things before we can answer that: the amount of hours per book, the amount of time to listen to each of the book and the amount of days it takes to finish the book.\n\n2. In the numerator, we have one hour with 6 audiobooks (30 hours per book) and one hour per day; this does not change from one book to another.\n\n3. However, in the denominator, there are three parts: the number of days it takes her to finish a book, the number of hours a chapter takes and the number of chapters in a book. These parts are going to vary from one book to other, so we will have to treat them separately.\n\n4. Let's first talk about the number of days it would take her to finish the book. We know that the formula for number of books read in a period of time T is: `b=T/t` where `b` represents the number of books. Hence, the formula for the number of days is: `b= 6/(15/30)` (rounded off). This means that it takes six days to finish the six books.\n\n5. We know the number of days it will take her to finish the six books, but how long each chapter will take? According to the question, each chapter is about fifteen minutes and there are thirty chapters per book, but we can't see how many minutes per chapter will take Fernanda (otherwise we will have to do the three part again).

Therefore, we know that Henry can not have collected 59 by himself. \nSecondly, we can eliminate Option B: John since we know from the sentence that John collects 11: \"Henry, John and [Leo collected] some seashells from...\" Therefore, John cannot have collected 11 seashells. \nThirdly, we can eliminate the option C: a 100 as this is a number that can not be divided by four and the word \"quarter\" is used in the sentene to depcict the number 25.\nSo the options that remain are E: a 25 and choice D: a 49.

This is because, in taxation, he is taxed 10% of annual income which is then further deducted accordingly.\n\n2) Alex also pays 10% as a tithe of income. Therefore, 10% or 50 dollars of the 500 dollars spent is 50 dollars.

The word \u201chim\u201d is a clue to indicate the owner is making the decision to train the dogs himself. \n- Option A is not the correct response because it talks about the pets getting the house floors separated.

One performance takes 3 hrs.\nThe price of the ticket depends to the hours  he spend  in the  theater\nand  stands  at $5 for each hours.How much does he want to  spend in 6\nweeks.\n\n### Rationales:1 The question revolves around visitation of shows at a theater. The word \"at least\" indicates Mark is going to visit once a week and as he does this it's stated he wants to go to the theater for 3 hours.\n2. The theater costs $5 for each hour attended and it's stated that there are 6 weeks of visitation.\n3. Taking the second part of the information into account, it's possible that Mark visits during two performances to match his attendances in the span of the 6 weeks.\n4. In this scenario he visits for a total of 6 hours and 30 minutes (6 weeks * 3 hrs = 18 hrs * $ 5 = $90 + 30 minutes free).\n5. We can rule out visitation for longer than six hours as it isn't stated that he's going to visit for a longer duration.\n6. Therefore, the total cost of visiting the theater in 18 hours is $90.\nAnd since there's two performances, we can then calculate the total cost as:\n\n$90 + 1 * $90 = $180 \n\n7.

{"text": "Carrie can afford a new iPhone by working 10 weeks babysitting, thus $800 divided by $80, equals 10 weeks.\n\n### Rationales:\nUsing the equation of $800 divided $80, multiplied by 10 weeks, we can see that she can afford a new iPhone. Additionally, if the equation is rearranged from $800 divided 10 weeks to $8 divided 100, we see it equals $200. Thus, we can conclude Carrie can afford her new iPhone with the $240 she receives for trading in her Samsung Galacy plus the $200 she can earn babysitting plus $240, bringing the total to $640. Therefore, she would purchase the iPhone and be able to have the $240, $200, and $640 she has to work with during her time babysitting.

{"text": "Answer: There might be some confusion and misunderstandings in this part due to the format and questions being tricky. So please pay close attention to all the explanations and notes below for better understanding.\n\nSo first of all, the instructions stated that in a compound, the numbers of the cats and dogs (dogs > cat) are 20% less. This can be interpreted as the 20% of the dogs (or the 80% of the cat) is lesser than the dogs, but the dogs are more than the cats.\n\nTherefore, the original numbers should be adjusted accordingly, 1.8 dogs > 1.2 cats > the original number.\n\nTo calculate the 1.8 dogs over the 1.2 cents, let's try putting the ratio under the division sign:  \n\\begin{code}\n\n1.8  > 1.2 ( or 80%)\n\\end{code}    5\n\nLet's try to put the percentage value under the division sign:   \n\\begin{code},5\n1.8  / 1.2   (or 80% / 20%)\n\\end{code    4    \n\nThus, the numbers of 1.8 dogs  and of 1.2 cash is the ratio 4:3. The 3 cats are 30% under the 4 dogs.    \n\nNow since the original total number of animals was 160, then the total number of animals in the compound should be the sum of the total number of the dogs (or cats) + twice the number (2) of the frogs (or 2*2 = 4).\n\\begin{code}{3(4:3) =  9*5 =   45\n\n1 + 45 = 46\n\n46 - 160 = 114\n\n12:13 is 160 : 114}\n\\end{code\n\nThe answer is therefore 160 (but actually the answer is not 160). \n\nAlso, we can assume that the question above can be interpreted more as a multiple choices question rather than a direct mathematical question, since the question does not explicitly state what type of calculation method should be", "answer": " 304"}

According to this data, 50 out of 90, or 55 guests, drank soda. This is equivalent to 550 out of 2,950 drinkers, which calculates to 19% of all drinkers.\n250 guests out of 2,860, or 87%, drank juice, so 5/8 of the juice drinkers actually drank juice, while 3/8 didn't. 4/5 of the juice drinks were consumed, indicating 80% were consumed. 90/195, or 47%, drank the sparkling water. Therefore, 90/240, or 37%, is a fraction of the water drinkers who drank sparkling water. Combining the figures yields: 55% - 19% + 47% + 37% = 90%. It's known that the guests who drank soda, juice, and sparkling water each had 50 of the 500 drinks, so if the recyclable can and bottles are 4/5 recycled, the remaining 19% of each drink would equal 11,900/500, or 24.

Options A, B, E can be eliminated. First, we are given that 160 words equals to 1 page. Thus, any multiple of 160 is also considered 1 page in this equation.\n2. As for options C, we are led to believe that 4 pages is equal to 4 multiplied by another unit that measures length. 4 pages = 4 * some other unit of length. This implies that any multiple of 4 is also equal to a multiple of the same unit of length.\n3. It follows from the given context that, 160 words = a page, and 4 pages = 1 * some other unit of size or length. Thus, 160 must equal to 1 unit of length that is equal in magnitude to 1 * some other multiplier of 4. Option D, in this case, is the correct answer since 160 words can be converted to 1 unit of paper length or 300 pages.\n\n\nAs 160 words per page also means that 160 pages equate to 1 page.\n\nAnswer 160 pages\n\n### Input::\n### Demonstation:\nInput: The pearl clutchers were known for their extravagant lifestyle and their wild parties, which often lasted even until the next afternoon.

Total steps: 20+40+13 steps = 73 steps.\n\n\n* 3 staircases * 73 steps = 219 steps. 150 in step is a whole number.\n* Option C: We can eliminate options B and C because there is 12 more steps in option C (60+40+30+13 steps). That would make it impossible for him to have climbed only 150 feet, as he would need to have climbed 156 feet. \n* Option D: The last two lines indicate that the answer is 150.\n* Option E: The stipulation that each staircase is 0.5 ft doesn't change the final number of steps or the total height.\n* The only option that fits the criteria is D, and thus, it is the correct one.\n* Option E is incorrect.

{"text": "The best answer is C 35\n\n### Demostration: \nThe question asks about the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel, which we can figure out from the choices given.\n\n1. Option A:  He gave Miguel 20 cards. This is unlikely as he wants to make sure he has 130 left to give to others. So this can be eliminated.\n\n2.  Option B: He gave Miguel 40 cards. This is also unlikely since Rick will make sure to keep 130. So it can be eliminated. \n\n3. Option C: He gave Miguel 35 cards. This makes sense as this would guarantee that there wouldn\u2019t be any more than there should be. Rick, being smart, doesn\u2019t want an unequal number of cards.

Then, \"you should study for an hour\" means \"I believe one hour should be spent studying\". It therefore implies that if the student should study for an hour, then s/he should study for 2 hours more, or 3 hours in total.\n\n### Alternatives : The best answer is D 3 hours.\n\n#### 09/06/2021\n### Instruction  : 500 children went on an educational trip.

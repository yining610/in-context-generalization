This is because the man has been studying math and if that means he has been studying it for a couple of days, then we know that he doesn't lack something.\n3. When the man is studying math, he has all means at his disposal to successfully study, meaning he has his desk, his bed and his room available.\n4. Thus, we know at least that he has his bed so to answer this question, the correct answer must be something he hasn't. The most logical answer would be the opposite of 'have' namely, 'lack,' which means at least that he has NOT lacked something.\n5. Lack means to not have something so the most logical answer to this question would be the opposite of to lack something which is to not lack something. Hence, we can confidently eliminate all the options except the last one which is 'his bed.'\n\n### Demostration:Write a response that appropriately answers the following student question.\n\nInput: A 25-year-old man says he needs to complete certain tasks to achieve his personal objectives.

{"text": "The correct answer is B: 14 pounds.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Ken first poured into the box of goodies enough jelly beans equal to 2 pounds. We don't know if the quantity of jelly beans added was in multiples of 1, 2, or any other number of jelly beans; however, since we know that 2 is the amount of pounds added, it would stand to reason that the quantity added was 2 pounds. \n2. Then, Ken added enough brownies to triple the weight, which means, in our example, that he added a total 6 pounds.\n3. Next, Ken added enough gummy wrist to double the weight once more. \n4. Finally, Ken added another 2 pounds worth of jelly beans, which brings the total weight to 14 pounds. However, if we add together 8 (2 + 6 + 2) pounds, we reach 14.

For clarity, let \"x\" denote the number of crafts sold, and \"n\" for the amount of money received, in dollars, on the craft.\n\nBy definition, Hillary sells three crafts in a day. Since we've been given that her crafts cost 12 dollars each, we can deduce that n must equal 36 dollars. This is because, if we make x = 0, n + x is 36 dollars.\n\nHillary is not given extra money to work with, yet since she receives extra money as described in the problem, we may safely assume that she is taking her net profit and depositing it into her bank account. Let d represent the dollar amount she deposits into her account. (For clarity, we'll be working in dollars, with x, n, and d representing money values in dollars and \"x/d\" representing how many dollars per handmade craft Hillary has.)\n\nNow, the money on hand for a handmade craft varies based on how many crafts Hillary sells.

She also had to erase 12 sentences=40 * 6=240, she typed 18 more=36, which means 504+18+40+1=537 which means she started with 253 sentences. She typed 88+253=341 sentences. She ended with 536 sentences, so the difference is 15. 536-15=321+253=574-253=321*6=1966 and she typed 1966-88=1878. So she typed 1878+253+16=2158 over two days- 253=1905. So the answer is 1905\n* Janice can write 6 sentecnes per minute, but she can type twice as fast, so 12 sentecnes per minute. 12 x 2days = 24 sentecnes; she started with 24, and she ended with 537 sentences in 2 x 2days which means 537-524 =33; then, 1+33/6 =5, so the answer is 205, therefor the answer is 2149.\n\n### Input:-4 + (-7)\n\n### Answer:3\n\n### Rationale:-7 * -4 =-28;3+20*2=-4;-4+20*2=6; 8-6=-2\n\n#### Input:\n\n-7*4\n-7*-4\n-4*-3\n-4*2\n-12*5\n-16*2\n\n#### Rationale:\n-7*4=8*,-7*-4=-4*-3*2; -12*5 = -4*-2;\n\n#### Input:-3 * -5\n\n### Answer:-\n\n###", "answer": " 258"}

The total number of pages that she has read can be calculated as : (1 + 3 + 1) x 40 = 156\n### Rationales: \n1. The total number of chapters cannot be understood until after 4 o' clock. We have information about the reading time before 4:00 PM but not after it.\n2. Thus, Mitchell hasn't read any chapter after 4:00 because she has only read one chapter before 3:00 PM. The options before '4:00' might also mean chapters read in the last hour before 4:0.\n3. So to know which chapters Mitchell had read, we only need the information about 'time after 4:0' and the total number of chapters.\n4. The options about number of chapters read before 4:0 might mean chapter read in the first two hours before 4:0 PM or chapter read in the last two hours before 4 P.M.\n5. So, options about 'before 4' cannot give us information about 'the total number of chapters that Mitchell had read'.\n6. And hence the question asks information about the total pages of chapters together.\n7. There are 40 pages in each and every chapter. And Mitchell read three chapters after 3:00. The total number of 40 x 3 =120 pages Mitchell had read together after she started studying from before 3:0. and the total pages she read are 1 + (1 x 3) + 120 = 151\n8. So, she read 151 pages.\n9.

{"text": "Answer: D: 32 mangoes\nThe question is asking for the number of mangoes left in Colby's mango tree after selling the remainder of its fruit. 20 kilograhs was sold to the market, leaving 30 kilograms to be distributed amongst the community.\nEach kilogram contains 8 kilograms of mangoes, meaning that 24 kilograms of manges are in each kilogram. Given that we have 30 kilograhs, we can divide 30 by 24 to receive the number of kilograms.\nWe'll proceed by rewriiting this and then dividing the correct number of mangoes by the number of kilograhs.\nThe first way: 30/24\n30 divided by 24 will give the resulting number for the number of kilogamges remaining.\nSince the remaining number of kilograms will be distributed in equal amounts of mangoes, the formula for this can be represented by the number of remaining kilograms divided by number of mangoes inside each kilogram.\nThe second way: 30 divide by 24 to give the number of kilogams remainding.\nBoth methods will give the same answer and hence, the answer is 32 mangoe.", "answer": " 160"}

The last sheep in the paddock is about 100m from the first sheep. \nHow far apart are they, on average?\n\n**Options**\n- About 1m apart on average.\n- About 20m apart on average. (not correct)\n- About 100m apart on average\n- About 1km apart on average. (the right answer)\n- The sheep are evenly spaced, on average.\n\n**Solution**\nAs the question states, the sheep are not evenly spaced, nor are they exactly 100m in between each sheep. The question states that the last sheep is 100m away from the first  (ie 200m for the entire paddock with 100m between each sheep).\nLet's say sheep are xm apart. \n- The question does not state that the sheep are a certain number, but lets assume there are 100 sheep in the paddick (it makes the solution easier).\n- Each sheep is 10m away from the next (they are not evenly spac) => 10 *  100 + 20 x 0  = 1000 (200 is the same in both calculations because the last sheep is 200 away", "answer": " 1920"}

{"text": "The answer would be a rabbit and a weasel. Let's say that there are two foxes that went in for an average of four and two, respectively, and one fox went in for an average five, leaving one rabbit and one weasel to be left after three weeks.\n\n### Rationales:1. The question asks how many rabbits and weaasels would be left after three weeks of fox hunting.\n2. To solve this problem, we must first model the situation with three foxes hunting a region of forest containing 100 weassels and 50 rodents.\n3. As we go through this process, we will track what percentage of the weasels and rodents are hunted by each of the three foxes.\n4. There are three foxes hunting the region and each one is catching an average of 4 and 2 rodents per week.\n5. Over three weeks, each fox will average 12 rodents caught.\n6. When we subtract the total number of foxes from the total number of rabbits and rodents, this leaves us with 50 + 110 - 300 = 50 + 80 = 130.\n7. Hence, in three weeks' time, there would be 130 weasels and rodants left. \n8.

So, there is no way for 2 pills per day to be an option.\n\nFor option B, we divide 51 by 25 or 2 per day: the answer for the days of the week is Friday. This is because of it being a day end with a \"y\".  By Saturday, it will be one day and there will be one pill left.  By Sunday, 2 more pills will be left.  This leaves 20 pills left by Monday.\n\nFor option C, we divide 54 by 27 or 2 per day (not including ending day). Then, we take one away from 6 or add 1 to seven. Thus, there will be only be two pills left at 6 days and 1 pill left when it is at 7 days.\n\nFor option D, we divide 59 by 29, this will result in 20 days of pills.

Choices: A: chew B: bark C: growl D: eat E: bury\nRationales:1. The question is phrased such that it is asking about what the dog is doing in relation to the action of it being'sitting.'\n2. The'sitting' and 'chewing' portion are easy enough to understand, but with regards to the dog 'chewing on what', we have to think about the specific item that the dog might be chewing on: it could be anything from food to furniture.\n3. However, since we are discussing what a dog would 'chew on' when it is'sitting' rather than 'chewing', this narrows down our options considerably, and reduces the options to only 'eat' and 'bury'.\n4. Of these options, given that a dog is sitting, the 'bury' option would be too much work for a dog to be doing. Also, there would be no point to having a dog chew on something and then bury it. So, 'eat' should be the answer.\n5. Moreover, given that it is 'chewing on' and not 'chewing', it's unlikely to be food - it's more likely that the dog is chewing on a bone or maybe some kind of toy.\n6.

This is because, at the station, people stand in line, and if they stand on the right side, they are likely to be at the rightmost spot in the line - or behind the last person in the line. Thus, the question would read \"How many out of 5 people have backpacks?\" to refer to the fourth person in line since the fifth person would be behind.

If this result is between 0 and 9, the divisor would be 9; otherwise, it would be 0.\n\n### Rationales (Part 1): Average and Divisor - Demos 1 and 2\n\nThe average is (9 / 9) * 12.7 = 11.583\n\nDemos 1 and 2 are equivalent to this: (9 / 14) * 12 = 17.886.\n\nThe averages are equal. The difference = 0.303. But the difference * 9 = 0.271, not greater than 0.300. Hence, the divisor = 9.\n\nThe average is 250 / 4 * 90 = 7.5.\n\nNot equivalent to Demo 2. The difference = 45.0, which is greater than 9.Hence, the divisor = -1.\n\nThe average = 2750 / 6 * 800", "answer": " 57"}

As the puppy weighs 64 pounds by month 3 of its adult growth, and by the end of that timeframe, it doubled to a total of 4 pounds.\n\nIf the dog weighs 68 pounds by 5 months' worth of its growth, then it has doubled from the initial puppy weight of 64. This means the answer to this next question to be: 126 pounds.\n\nAnd finally, after the dog reaches its final adult weight, it adds another 30 pounds, which means that the dog's full weigh is 116 pounds.\n\n### Response 2:\n\nIt is not possible to solve for the dog's full final adult weight with the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe response for the first part of the question is accurate and correct. The second part does not answer the question. \n\n**Hint:** The last question is designed to test your problem solving and analytical skills. For this reason, you will not get feedback that you did not solve the question correctly.\n\n### **Explanation:**\nWe can assume that \"final aduts weight\" will be 152 \n\nThe first adult weight is known to be - puppy weights : 6 pounds at 7 weeks old\n\nThen we have the first formula 152 = 62 + 126 = 84 + 64\n\nThe second formula 152 + 30 = 1262\n\n**Directions:**\n\n### Instructions:If you read this, then you're ready for the test.

{"text": "20 hours\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### Excuse:\n\n1. In the question, we know Kenny played 10 houes of basketball, he ran for twice as long  as he played basketball and he practiced on th trumpet for twice longer than he ran. We are told that we are supposed to work out how many hours Kenny played on the trumpet.\n\n2. One way of going about this is to calculate the total number of times Kenny ran and divide it by the number he played basketball, then multiply that number times the length of time he played basketball. \n\n3. If we did this, we would arrive at 40hours. This is the number of hours Kenny practiced on the trumpto. \n\n4. However, there are better ways of arriving at the answer given other information the question provides, specifically, that Kenny has a goal to train for an Olympics in basketball, that he only has 2 days to do this, and that he must be able to eat 3 times. This means that for every hour of basketball activity, he must eat 3 times. \n\n5. To work out how many hours he must eat, we need the total number of times he played basketball. We know he played for 10 hours so that means to work out the total number of hours he must eat is 130 (as 3 times 10 equals 30, which is the same as 10+10+10). We also know that every hour of basketball involves a meal. So for every ten meals, Kenny will require 30 more, or one meal every 30 times, giving us a total of 6 times of 10 meals or 1.05 times to eat.\nThe total number of times needed to eat is 6 which therefore means 75 total meals. Therefore the times will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 which means for each total time of 10 meal, Kenny will have eaten 9 meals already ( 9 + 3 = 12 which equals 5 total meals) if he eats for 10 meals.\n6.

Choices: \n\n### Demostration:2008\n\n### A: \n\n## Rationales: \n1. The instructions specify that the date was broadcasted in America, not in some other country, so it is reasonable or logical to choose the year closest to America for the time being. \n2. There are many time periods in US history where television became popular, like in the 1950s to 1970s. \n3. While the 2000s is also a time period where various forms of television became known, this answer is specifically asking about the first American broadcast. 4. Thus, we can exclude the years 2000 to 2009 as these questions are not directly related to the year in which the television series was broadcasted in America\n5. Now, 1947 is the first year that television series existed in America, making it the most likely and most rational answer.\n\n**Answer: 1947**\n\n## Instruction:The first television broadcast began in America in:\n## Demonstration Choices:\n1. 1957, when the TV show named \u201cAmerican Bandstand,\u201d became popular, was the year when the famous show \"American Bandstand\" became popular.\n2.

When The Tonight Show started, becoming the 4th longest-running talk show on Television.\n5. When \"Family Feud\"  which is a game show that pits two families against each other in a contest. was broadcasted on the American television network ABC.\n\n## Rationals: The first television broadcast happened in America in the year 1947, and by this choice we are not talking about a more recent broadcast. The question states that  the year the broadcast took place in America. \n\nThe most logical answer is 1947 ( A ) as the first television broadcast", "answer": " 28"}

It is true that we have to first take out what we initially spend on the box of light bulbs, then we take out the other half, giving us a total of 16 light bulbs left. Now we have another half of the remaining box of 40. Since the box is a round shape, and we should not include any other quantity other than the remaining bulbs.

{"text": "Jonah made $18.\n#### Rationales:\n1. The number of pineapples is x.\nThe total cost of the pineapples is $3x.\n2. The number of pizza rings is y.\nThe cost for a pizza ring is 5$y.\n3. The total revenue is the product of the cost of the product, which is $3x, and the number of rings, which is 12y.\nThe total revenue is therefore $3x*12y = $36x.\n4. If Jonah made a profit of 18, then he would have gained 18x, as a profit is the money earned from selling items.\nThe profit would be 18x = 18(36x).\n\n5. 18(3x) becomes 64x which reduces to 64x = 18x.\n6. We can divide both sides by 18 to get x = 6x.\n7.

Choices: 1. A: trustworthy 2. B: creativity 3. C: empathy 4. D: patience 5. E: intelligence \nRationales: This question is asking what qualities are most important in kids. Let's look closely at each option and evaluate their merit \n1. Trustworthiness does not seem as important in kids as other options, since they often are not working with their own money yet. \n2. Creativity is perhaps a good quality in a child, but it may not be directly related to important qualities, as opposed to patience, which is necessary for a good learner. \n3. Empathy is a quality that makes a good person and also helps a kid to understand the world better. \n4. Patience, as mentioned above, is important for learning and will help a child do well in school.\n5. Finally, intelligence is perhaps the most important and necessary trait for kids to be successful.

The question is a word problem. That means we use what we would use in real life.\n2. A fruit and vegetable merchant is the one who sells fruits and vegetables. The merchant needs to know how much to sell and buy.\n3. So, they might need to know what the total mass of fruits and vegetables that they need to buy.\n4. We know 15 kg of the carrot is already bought. But we need to find the sum in the answer.\n5. So, first, we write down the masses.\n6. The merchant bought 8 kg of carrot, 8 kg of zuchinia, 13 kg broccoli.\n7. The merchanted sold 14 kg of carrot,14 kg of zuchinna.\n8. Thus, 8 kg of carret was sold and 8 kg of zucciini was sold.\n9. But he kept 8 kg of brocolli.\n10. He sold 14 kg brocolli. But we need to deduct the brocolli he kept.\n11. So, we will get 8 kg. 14kg was sold.\n12. Then, we need to deduct mass of carrots, zucchinis and broccoli that were sold.\n13. Thus, we get the result: 8 kg + 13 kg + 8 kg - 14 kg - 15 kg. That is 8 + 13 + 8 - 14 - 15 = 0\n14.

Example input: If February's leap day is Friday, enter as input:\n\n## Solution (for every month)\nWe use the formula (365) to determine the amount of days in a calendar year. We use the formula, (365/5) to determine the total amount of days in a given month. We use the formula \u201c30/31\u201d to determine what the day of the particular month would be. For our last equation, we use 365/5, to find the total amount of days that the particular month has (month x). Then, we take the month x, with the days, and multiply it with the value. We then divide the result of the multiplication of month x with the value, with the formula (366). We take out the remainder after we divide the result after subtracting the remainder of (28) from the remainder. Next, we add the remainder to the result of the addition of the remainder of the days that we add", "answer": " 249"}

E) In the store.\nRationales: This question is about a scenario in which a woman is walking from work to the store, and the question asks about four times she could be caught and one time she could not.\n\nAnswer: B) Leaving work is the one time she would not be caught; work is the time she finishes her shift and is either on break or after her shift. Entering the parking lot or the store is when people are caught at the beginning or end of their trip, after they have left the work place.

{"text": "There are four parts to the answer that must be considered.  Rate per minute x Time x # of holes = Amount (in ounces)\n\n1. The largest hole leaks 3 ounces over 1 minute; thus it leaks 18 ounces over 2 minutes and 45 ounces over 50 minutes.  \n2. The medium-sized and smallest holes leak at one-third and one-half the rate, respectively, of the largest hole.\n3. The solution is to multiply 45 by.3 to get 14, thus the amount that leaks from the smallest hole is 15 ounces over the 2 hour time period.  \n4. Multiply 45 by.50 to get 22.5, thus the amount that flows from the medium-sized sink is 24 ounces over 40 minutes.\n5.

We just have to get the number of hours Jeff spends on weekend catching up times the 3 and we have the number of hours he works in a day on the weekend. Then it is a matter of multiplying the number of hours he spends in weekends by the total number of days in weekends i.e. 2. Then the total number of hours in the weekend is 6. To get the daily working hours we just have to multiply the total hours of the weekend with the number of days for it: 6*2 is 12. Now we have to multiply our daily working hrs by 4.

When someone says they \"used to\" be afraid of the dark, they are indicating two things:\n 1. that they are not afraid of the dark in the present, and\n 2. that they used to be afraid of something.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Dark is a noun (a part of speech) referring to something with no light, and being afraid of something is an adjective (a part of speech). In this context, it would make sense that \"dark\" refers to what the person is afraid of, not why they are afraid of it.\n2. It would make sense for \"phone\" to be what they are afraid of if the person was afraid that they would be in the dark if they had to use their phone. However, this does not seem logically possible from the context.\n3. Since the person doesn't say that they are afraid in the morning, it doesn't make sense to say that they are afraid of the morning unless they are describing nighttimes as the morning (which the context does not imply).\n4. A person is typically afraid of the night. Therefore, \"dark is scary\" would not make sense.\n5.

The options provide common actions that one could take when making milk.\n3. But when reading through the options, it can be seen that mixing in fruit is not necessarily one of them.\n4. So, this is not the correct answer since mixing in fruit is not a common action one might do to make something healthy with milk.\n5. Moving on to the next option B: using in cookings. This option is more plausible in this context as milk is commonly used in cooking.\n6. Similarly, option D: drinking is also an option, since one could consume milk as a drink.\n7. However, option C: using for desset is not a common action to make something healthy. One doesn't typically consume dessert to make something healthy so we can eliminate this option.\n8.

{"text": "There are in all:\n- 8 dogs\n- 40 cats\n\n### Answer: A: 8 B: 40 C: 143 D: 270 E: 530 F: 452\n\n### Answer explanation:\n### Let's take a look at the population and each individual family and start with the family with two dogs in it.\nA person in a family with two dogs in total will have 2 dogs in their possession.\n\nBased on the question, we can tell that all 50 members in the given society will own four dogs.\n\nThen for cat population\nWe start with the family with 1 dog in it and also assume that it is the only family to have 1 dog.\n\nSo if the above assumption is made, we can determine that the number of families that own 1 dog will be 20 which equals to 20 cats.\n\nSo 20(one) family owns 1 dog and in that family we have 1 cat. So there are 20 cats in all.\n\nSimilarly, we can find the number of dogs in all. There are 8 (40 - 32) dogs and 40 cats.\nAs a result, there are 144 (8*20) cats in all. We then compare this population with that of the cat's population to find out whether it is more or less.\n\n### Conclusion\nA community of 50 people with 15 families owning two dogs each and the remaining 20 families owning 1 dog each, totaling 8 dog families and 20 cat families will have 40 cats owned by the cat families and the remaining 46 cats will be held by the dog owner. Based on this information, there are 15 families with dogs and 20 families with cats which brings the total of animals in this community to 40 cats and 8 dogs. To sum up 40 cats are in all and 8 dogs are also in all.\n\nNow, we subtract the lesser from the greater, leaving 30(8 \u2013 40) cats in total, to be a lesser amount than the greater population of dogs at 4(40 \u2013", "answer": " 80"}

Option A is A quarter and a half which is two halves of a quarter plus a half. Therefore, it is not less than a quarter and less than a half. The answer is C: a quarter and a quarter.\n4. Option A is less than a quarter meaning it is a four divided by two. Option C is more than a quarter meaning it's a four divided by less than two.

You need to travel 5 hours via train. Each ride goes via bus and costs $3. Your train is $3. What do you need to do to have $5 after your ride is over?\n\n### Rationales and response:\nI.  Consider all the options for each individual transportation method (bus, train, walk).\nA. Consider all the options for a bus and train ride. Each bus ride is only $5 if you ride for 1 hour.\nB. For each bus/train combination, there is an opportunity cost.  For example, $5 is one bus.  But the train can also take you 1 hour.  Since one bus is available and can\u2019t be replaced elsewhere, there\u2019s a $5 opportunity cost for any bus-train ride.  The bus-train can allow the passenger to go about their activities for 1 hour less than if they took the bus alone for that hour.  That\u2019s the opportunity cost.\n\nC. So, there\u2019s a different opportunity cost for each bus-train transportation option.  You need one $5 bill, not two.\n\nD. Since all the other options take longer, the total opportunity cost is also higher.  This is because for each one hour, you do not take a bus-train as you go across.  This means you have to take a longer overall train, adding to the total opportunity cost.  As a result, the opportunity costs go higher over time.

{"text": "Let's set up our logic for this question.\n\nFirst, we know that Shara collects them. So the goal is to find out how many she collects after she goes on vacation. Our solution is to just say she collects 5 plus 6 or 16 shells.\n\nThen we know she has 20 shells and that her total would be 16, and that the last day she had 6. So we do 6 - 20 = -14, which is negative.\n\nSo our answer would be 20 - 20 = 0 on the last day.\n\n### Input:\"If a number is even, you use it\", where does it most likely fall among the choices?

Choices:  First number on a list A: True  B: False C: The number after it D: The number before it E: Even\n\n### Response\n\n\" If we use a number it most likely refers to \" a list \" so lets think like that. The option A: True if they use a number it does actually mean the fist number on a list. But they would use every number so we cannot use even numbers we have to use anything between 1 - the last number.\n\n### \" If a choice is false, you use a different one\"\n\n\n\"If a choice is false, then you can change it to true\"\nTherefore our answer has to be B - it is the number that is not true \n\n### \"I have a friend who is not me, their name is (my name)\"\n\n### \t\n\nRationales: Firstly, when I hear 'friend' I know we're talking about a singular, so I'm going to eliminate anything that is plural", "answer": " 41"}

How many media items of each type does he have in the new house?\nAnswer: Aaron has 1800 media items in the new house; this number is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n### Difficulty:Medium; no calculator.\n\n### Rationales\n\n\"Medium\" and \"No calculator\" mean that the problem should be solvable without a calculator and that the difficulty level is around medium.\n\n\"Number\" indicates the quantity of items to which the calculation applies. In our example, the person has to determine how many books/DVD he owns.\n\n### Task Directions\n\"Medium\" may indicate that the calculation is not complex, but it may require more than one step to solve it. \nIt may also indicate that the numbers may be higher than the student can handle, so the student has to use some process of elimination. \nHowever, the student shouldn't find the actual computation difficult.\n\n\"Rationales\" show why the answer is correct. These should not include calculations. If an explanation is more than a line, divide it up into multiple rationales. For example, if the answer is 2 + 3 = 5, the rationales would be: 1. Addition is the operation needed. 2. Adding 2 to 3 gives the sum of 5.\n\n### Additional Instructions\n\nOptional - For the more difficult problems, you may add more \"task directions\".

{"text": "Harry ran on Friday at a speed of about 160 meters.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe first part of the question is already a part of the explanation - Harry is joining a marathon, hence he practices, varies workouts, and so on.\n1. On Monday, Harry ran 10 meters in an hour.\n2. On Tuesday, he ran twice as fast as he did on Monday.\n3. From Tuesday, till Thursday, he ran at 50% faster speed than on Monday.\n4. By Friday, he ran 3 times twice as fast as he ran on Monday.\n5. On Friday, he ran 800 meters in an hour at a speed of 50% of 2. This means that Harry runs 50% of speed of 10, which is 5, to find speed of 800 meters.\n6. Hence, we can conclude that Harry ran 800 in an hour at about 5 miles or 1600 meters in an hours, which is about 160 in an hour.\n\n### Input : The gym was open the previous month and a person can now join. The manager asked the secretary to check how many members. Answer the following statements with your response.\n\n### Response :\nIf the gym is open then the number of members is 60\n\n### Rationales : To answer this question, we need to look for the number of members in the gym.\n\n1. Option A is incorrect because the sentence \"The manager asked the secretary to\" means the manager was asking the secretary for the number of members.\n2. Option B doesn't make sense because the gym closed in the previous month and the gym will open in the current month. They are still counting the members.\n\n3. We can eliminate Option C since the manager cannot say that the gym is not open.\n4. Option D would be true if it was last month. Gym wasn't open last month so we can remove this option.\n\n### Therefore, option A is the answer.", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "He left  $27.00 \n\n### Dem\nInput: How is ice melted to create ice? Choices:  C: snow B: water E: clouds D: air\nRationales:\ninput: The question asks about the process of melting ice to make ice.\n1. Let's analyze each option:\n - B: water. The process involves the use of water to melt the ice. So, the answer should be one of the options that involves water. Hence, the correct answer is B: water.\n - C: snow. Since the process describes melted ice, snow would not be involved. We can eliminate this.\n - D: air. One might think that air would cause the ice to melt, but this process involves the use of cold water alone to melt the ice, so air does not really play a part unless added as a tool or medium of temperature.\n - E: clouds. While clouds could provide a source of cold water in a weather system where they are present, clouds are not a specific factor for the melted ice process nor are clouds included in common knowledge as the medium or process to create ice.

First, let look at the answer. The answer is $129.35, is it really it? That's the wrong answer. Let look at what we did here. We had a question that ask how much he pays total if he needs to add 3 color cartridges, 1 black-and-white and a black-and- white cartridge. And the cost of each of them is black-and-white = $27, color = $32. So 3 * (27 + $27) * $32 = 27 * $32 + 3 * $27. Then we subtract 39 times the color price from the black-white price. That answer is $120.5, isn't it? Why did it turn to $129.5? Is it because of addition?

We are given that each box of bolts contains 11 bolts and each box of nuts contains 15 nuts, so in total, a box of bolts contains one hundred and one bolts, and a box of nuts contains seventy five nuts.\n\n2. We are also told that he bought one hundred and fifty-one bolts and ended up not using seventy two of them which means that he used one hundred and fifty bolts out of the seventy five that he bought.\n\n3. This can be written as 6(100+151) = 825.\n\n4. 6 is taken from the number of days early he finished the project and 825 is from the 825 bolts and 50 nuts that he did need to use.\n\n5. The answer that he used would be written as 100+13(100+ 151) = eighteen hundred and fifty-one(1851).\n\n6.  A box of bolts contains hundred and ten bolts(twenty bolts missing). So he was short six day's worth of bolts(51 + 3 = 54) to complete the project.\n\n7. Similarly, each box of nuts has fifty bolts remaining( one hundred and one -3 = ninety-six)\n\n8.

In this case, the average of the numbers would be (288 + 312 + 139 + 48 + 62)/5 = 257. The number below the average would be 239, which is greater than 62, the least number in the list.\n3. Looking for multiples: You can also look for any multiples that are smaller than the numbers in the list. For example, if we find the number divisible by 4 in the list, it would be 48.\n4. Finding the prime numbers: You can also look at the prime numbers in the list. The prime numbers in the list would be 28, 48, and 62. 62 is the only prime number in the list, so we can conclude that it is the least number.\n5. Applying any other strategies: You can also apply any other strategies you know to solve this problem. For example, you can use a calculator to find the average of the list and check if the number below the mean is the least number. You can also use your judgment to determine", "answer": " 72000"}

{"text": "There are ways to solve a problem, it is important to know different methods and when to apply which method. This can help you to be more effective and make less careless mistakes. It is also useful to be able to break down your problem into different steps for easier and faster solutions.\n\nOne method that is helpful to solve a problem is by decomposing it into parts and doing each part in turn, working on one part at a time.\n\nAn example of this method can be used by solving this problem.\n\nTo start, we can start by identifying key terms in the question. \"Natalia sold clippers\". These terms can be used for future calculations. We can also identify the type of information in the question, for example, this has information about people, clippers, their amount and months. The problem can then be rewritten in numbered terms.\n\nNow we can start our calculations. Let us focus on clippers. We know from the question that Natalia sold 48 in April and then sold 24 in May.\n\nWhat we can do to make the calculation easier on ourselves is to set down a table where we can write down the values and use it in our calculations. This can make the calculations easier and more exact.\n\nStarting off with the values from the table, we can see that:\n\n48 + 24 = 72\n\nWe write these values in the table to remind ourselves of them.\n\nThen we have:\n\n24\n\n+\n\n16\n\n=\n\n40\n\nWe write these down as well in the table.\n\nThe next value we will need to find is:\n\n72\n\n-\n\n40\n =\n\n32\n\nBut that means we do not have the answer yet, so we return to finding the values.\n\nLet us think about April. To find how many clippers were sold in April, we will have:\n\n-\n\n24\n=\n\n52\n\nFor May, the value will be:\n\n-\n40\n=\n\n20\n\nNow we finally have our answer to what the question asks, namely:\n\n32\nclippers\n \nWe can write this down as well in the calculation table.\n\nThere are lots of different ways in which this problem can be solved, but you can also", "answer": " 72"}

{"text": "Mr. Benson paid $490\n### Demonstation:\n**Rationales:**\nOption A: The question is asking for how many Mr. Benson paid. We know that a single ticket cost 40, and he bought 12, so the total individual price would be 480. The 5% discount is for every ticket that exceeds 11, so we can simplify the price as (480 - 320 = 160) 1.6x or 160% discount. \nNow, we multiply the total price by the %discount. So, 160% means he will pay 2/3 of the original total price. Thus, he'll pay 2/3 * 480 = 480 x 2/3 = 420/3. This is 420, so we can round to 421. Then, we subtract the 20% he saved on the 12 tickets, so the difference is 421 - 24. 421 -40 = 381, so Mr. Benson's total cost is 381 + 24 = 405.\nFinally, we round to 405.5, which is 405.

We are therefore given the ratios of sales made in each section: a) (3/36) =.083:b) (1/36) = 0:028:c)(rest) = (28/36) =.778(1/1) = 0:8336 = \\.8336\n\nLet X be the number of sales in section 3, then we could write: a) \\.833+.833+X = 1:b).117 +X = 0:c) \\.047 + X = \\.83736 =.8336To solve using algebra, we could let X = 7. To solve (a) as simple algebra, we could write: 0.8336 =.8217 +.1538 (their sales are.8336, but section 3 is.1538 of their overall sales). Thus we might write: 833.8336 - 821.8336  =.1538+7\n\nUsing this we could now solve this equation algebraically: 8338336 -833821.8=1538+ 7\n\nTherefore, 56.8336 + 7 = 1538 (or 56.8.3 + 7= 15.3836) and we can substitute in our new value for X in each of the other ratios. Thus, our ratios become: a)56.83/84.83 =.6612 =.065:b) 56.8/84.8+ 7 =.611/=.6612 = 0:c).6/7+7 =.889/=.661 =.83336To solve (c) the same way in terms of algebra, we might write: 56\\ 84.8=56/.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "A one-year newspaper subscription costs $42.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe question states: \"A one-year subscription (of) a newspaper is offered with (a) a 45% DISCOUNT. How much does the DISCOUNTED subscription cost if a subscription (normally) costs $80?\".\n\nThe underline denotes a variable, hence the only constant in the question can be identified as $80. This, in turn, makes the question an equation.\n\nUsing the rule of Subtraction of Like Terms, we can write the equation as \\( $80 - (4\\frac{45}{100})*80 * 45 = x $ \\) as described in\n\nwhich is an algebraic equation where we can perform subtraction of (literal) \"like terms\" (45) using the rules of Algebra.

Choices:  Choices: A: brain B: feet C: mouth D: ears E: liver\nRationales:\n1. \tThe \"Third brain\" is part of an urban myth claiming that the human body\u2019s stomach is actually a small brain of its own.\n2. \tIts main role is to control the sense of smell, which is associated with cravings and hunger.\n3. \tSo, when one's stomaches rumbles, according to the mythology, the so-called \"Third Brain\" has sensed a nearby food and is communicating with the body's main brain to make it hungry.\n4. \tThis third brain can be thought of as the center of all brainless activity that would otherwise be distributed elsewhere in the rest of the body.\n5. \tIt plays an important role in alerting the whole body to what it feels and experiences.\n6. \tThe question is posing the possibility that the third brain may have a mind or at least a sense of perception.\n7. \tAfter analyzing all the options, we can conclude that it\u2019s not a mouth, ears, or a liver because they are all organs within the human body and not perceivers.\n8. \tHowever, it may be possible that the Third Brain has a brain of its own.

This action of pulling a fish in is called \"pulling in\", and is the first part of the statement, in the first \"I\". Secondly, John took the fish out of this \"I\". Together, this action of \"pull\" and \"out\" is the phrase which John said \"took it out\", the second half of the line. Finally, John cleaned the fish after bringing it out of the water. This third action is \"cleaned\". Thus, the question and answer in which John answered \"I pulled it in, then [ I took it out and ] cleaned it\" perfectly match.\nC.

{"text": "Agriculture is a farming system that requires certain crops to grow well and thrive, as every type of crop demands a specific amount of resources to survive and mature. Corn, cotton, and beans are all commonly grown crops in large farms, but they have different requirements for watering and irrigation.\n\nTo begin, we must first calculate the total irrigation requirements for the three crops. This can be done by considering the irrigation needs of each crop and multiplying it by the number of acres that each crop covers. For corn, the irrigation requirement per acre is 20 gallons, and it covers 3 acres. Similarly, for cotton, the irrigation need is 80 gallons per acre, and it covers 9 acres. Finally, for beans, the irrigation requirements are double that of corn, so 40 gallons per ache, and it covers 12 acres.\n\nTo find out which farm requires the most water, we can determine the irrigation requirement for each field and multiply it by total acres. Thus, the total irrigation requirement for the three crops is 1040 gallons of water (3 x 20, 9 x 80, 12 x 40). We then get the ratio of water requirement for each farm in the same way, by determining the total water required by each farm and comparing it to the overall requirement.\n\nSubtracting the total water requirement (1040) from the total water allocation (3840) yields an ending number of 2800, indicating that each farm's water requirement is in excess of the water allocation.\n\nAfter calculating the total irrigation water requirement for corn and beans, the amount of water that corn requires is 5112 gallons, while that of beans is 2620 gallons. Adding these two numbers produces 7732 gallons of irrigation water required.\n\nHowever, 3840 gallons are available, leaving an excess of 390 gallons. This extra water would go to the farms, if they were on the top. The water allocation to each farm is calculated as 0.706 (10x3/20+10x9", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "Sonja used one-half of an ounce of oil to make the peanut butter.

This is an exa mple of a ratio; a special kind of a number such as speed. A ratio is used for measuring the proportionality and rate, for example, a ratio 3 to 1 means that for every 3 ounces of peans, 1 oz of oil should be used. This tells us that in every eight ounces peas that Sonja makes, two ounces of oils must be used. If Sonja uses 20 ouns of peas, how many ounces of oill can she use? By simple arithmetic, 20 can be divided by 8; therefore, she can use 4 ounces of oi. If we multiply the ration by the amount, we get half a ounce of oil (3)(8)/8=2 + 2(8)/8) = 4(32)/160=2(32)/144=32/72=1/2.", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "Input: If Stu has 9 books, then Albert has 4x as many as Stu has, and their total books are\u2026?\nRationales:  \n1. It's always important to understand the problem statement completely, and in this case it's important to understand it literally. After all, the question asks us how many books Stu and Albert have in their total possession.\n2. What is the context? Well, Stu and Albert each have a certain number of books.\n3. There are two people together, so we can assume that they have their books with them. In this case, we must consider how their total number of books are calculated.\n\nSo far, we have the following:\n\n- Stu has 9 books\n- Albert has a larger number of books than Stu has\n\n4. If Albert has a larger number than Stu, this means that we are considering the case where Stu and Albert have equal total number of books (this could also be considered the case when Albert has no books, or Stu has no books, but it seems unlikely).\n\n5. The reason for the use of times is to emphasize that the two quantities \"times together\" should be taken as one quantity. This \"times together\" is interpreted as addition to imply that both multiplicands should be added.  \n\nWhat is this multiplication about? Well it's about the relationship between the two sides.  \n\nSince Stu has 9 books  \nAlbert has a larger number than 9, this means that Albert has a number greater than 9  \nWe know that Albert has more than 4 times as many as Stu has  \n\nThis means that if Albert has more than 9 books, then his number of books will be greater than 36  \nSo Albert has books with greater than a total when Stu has 9 books. Thus, Stu and Albert together have over 43 books.  \n\nPut simply, in words: \nAlbert has more than 43 books than Stu has.\nTherefore, the answer is 43\n\n### Input\n\nIn what state is a car that has an 18 gears and a gas mileage of 42 mpg?\n\n#### Demonstration\n\n1.

So what the statement is saying is that the person who has the money will lose it after one more minute. So they will not necessarily have it after one more hour or a day. They just do not have it after just 1 minute.\n3. There are 2 options: \"have\" and \"don't have\".\n4. \"Have\" means that the person will at least have the dollar after 1 minute. However the statement said that \"he wont after one more minute\". If \"he\" would he actually have it after 1 minute. So, since \"he\" will not have the money \"after 1 more minute\". We can say that the person would have to not \"have\" it after some time.\n5. But there's no time mentioned. They said the person would still have it \"after 1 more more minute\". So it must be after some time. After another minute after that is 2 minutes, thus the person would have it \"after 2 minutes\".\n6.

{"text": "1280.5 pounds is the maximum weight of each of the following adult passengers so that the elevator will not be overloaded:\n\n|E|1280 lbs/2|\n\n### Response Explanations:The question asks for the maximum weight of the final passenger so that the elevator won\u2019t be overloaded.\n\n* Let\u2019s start off with one of the children. \nFirst, in order to find out the weights of the children, we can subtract the adults\u2019 average weight from the child\u2019s weights. We start with the boy, using the numbers from the table above:\n\n|B| 60 lbs - 140 lbs |\n\nThus, the boy's weight is 80 lbs.\n\n|G|86 lbs - 138 lbs|\n\nThus, Girl's weight is 91.8 lbs.\n\nSince one of the children weigh 80 lbs, the remaining child will be 91.8lbs.\n\nNow, the question asks for the maximum possible weight for the boy and the girl.\n\nSince there is no requirement as to the genders of the two final passengers, using the average of the adults' weights, one can be either a boy or a girl.\n\nThus, in order to make sure that the elevator won't be overloaded, the total weight of all passengers, including the final two passengers, should not exceed 759 lbs.\n\nTherefore, the maximum weight of two children is 91.1 lb each. Using this weight and the weight of the remaining two passengers, the maximum of the five passengers is therefore 597 lbs.", "answer": " 52"}

The question here is not to answer the question but to find the answer from the possible answers.\n2. The first character in a response is the character in the question. i.e. if she said J, then we should find J in the possible answers and that will be our answer.\n3. Let us assume she asked the last character and it is \"L\", so we have to look for L in possible answers (i.e. (J:9), (K:18), (L:25), (M:26)\n4.

We assume that Rose asked people for options that had 1, 2, 3 characters.\n2. It is very much clear that we have to pick a two character answer because we only have two characters, \"L\" and \"G\" for the question L: How much rice is left\n3. We also know that an answer does not make sense to Rose when an answer is less than an input.\n4. So we know that \"G\" and \"K\" cannot be the answers. Then we have only I and K with 8 characters.\n5. However, I is less than 23, so we cannot take it as an answer. And that leaves K which is greater than 23, hence it is answer of the question.\n6.

With this in mind, we can count up the given information to answer the question.\n3. Tina made a $120 in profit by selling 14 books to each customer. Therefore, we get $20 + $120 = $140.\n4.

But in this context no motorcycle would be used because to get to the destination quickly, one would use a less expensive more practical mode of transportation, namely a foot.\n   - Option B: The person would not ride in their car to the location, firstly because it is not the shortest most direct route here. Secondly, it is more expensive and not practical to have to go in and out of a car and walk to the destination on foot anyway.\n   - Option C: It is possible that the person may walk to the destination, like in option B but there are a few more things to consider.\n   - Option D: This may be a way of someone attempting to get to the location.

When he made $10,060 last year he received a $ 10,00 bonus, so he made a total of $110,06.  Let's assume that this year John earns $121,00 and he receive a bonus of $12,100. In effect, he'll make $133,100.\n\nI think the answer is more correct (A $121,100 as opposed to $210,100), but I'm not sure the reasoning. I'll need someone to explain it to me.\n\n### Peer's response:\n\nAnswer: John receives same bonus percentage every year in a bonus.  Last year he earns $100,600.  So his bonus was $(0.20)*($100,65), that is $($20,110), hence he makes $120,710.  Now he earns $200,60, hence his bonus will be $($20)*($200,651), that is, $($40,130).

Then there will be 20 games I didn't win, which leaves only 5 games I can beat Carla in.

When Carla wins a game against Frankie she gains one point and Frankie loses one point. Frankie wins half the games against Carla. Frankie wins exactly the same amount of games that Carla wins.

There are two possible ways of looking at this question, depending on how we view the homework: a \"learning homework\", or a \"project homework.\" \n3.  For the \"learning homework,\"  we can say that the homework is for the benefit of the learner, and that they're doing this work for themselves and not to be seen by others.  This type of homework does not have to be kept secret from others since it is for the learner's own benefit. \n4.  On the other hand,  for \"project homework,\" if this was done to present to others,  it does not make sense to keep them from seeing this work and therefore it would be shown to others.  Hence, the answer is B: for others.\n5.

It is important to note that the cinema can be accessed through two entrances, one on the left and the other on the right. The owner of the cinema was a very smart business woman, and she would sometimes stand outside her business with a sign to advertise the prices for tickets. In return for not getting caught, Mrs. Smith, her neighbor, was allowed to give these customers who came to buy a ticket a dollar off. If the total amount of tickets purchased over the span of a month was 2000, how much money did Mrs. Smith make after having given her five customers each 2 tickets?\n\n### Demostration\n1.

Choices: \nA: local convenience store B: local grocery store C: local bakery D: local hardware store E: local thrift store F: local gas station G: local bar\nRationales:\n1. The question asks for any store where you can get food that is suitable for human consumption.\n2. To assess the option, consider each store's food selection.\n3. Of the options, B, D, and E are all grocery stores where you can buy human-like food.\n4. However, some of these stores may not be in walking distance and hence unsuitable.\n5. This eliminates B, D, and G.\n6. E is also eliminated since it is unclear from the question if such food is available.\n7.

Since the word \"half\" refers to time, that means one would travel for 30 min, so we use 30/60 = 0.5 hr.\n3. Similarly, since \"twice\" refers to time, one would travel for twice as long as half an hour, so we use 2 * 30/6 = 60/60 =0.5\n\n4. Time= 30 mins + 60/2 hr\n\n5. Time= 36/2 hr\n\n6. Time= 18 hr\n\n7. Time= 1 hour\n\n8. Using 1 hour as our new unit for measure, the expression 30 mph + 60/4hr becomes 18/hour\n9.

That means that we need to calculate only the value of the erasers, not a sum that includes other possible contributions.\n\n### Rationeles:The question is asking for the total amount that the student council will sell or \"make\".\nThe value of the erasersthat the student council will sell is :  1. 384 ($0.75 * 24) erasers x 0.75\nSince the question requires the sum, we add all of the contributions and we get a total of:  480 ($0.75 x 24).  480 x $0.75 = 360 dollars.\n\nAnswer: 360 dollars\n\n### Input : \"If I am given one pound of sand, I can make five pounds of glass. \" What are the values of 200 gains and loses of profit in the first year of business.\n\n### Input 1.

If Billy is only able to choose one item, the baseball card is useless since it is only one unit of the total. The same is true for the toy car, since it's one unit of the total, Billy will ignore it.\n\n### Billy can pick either The most obvious choice here is the penny", "answer": " 864"}

{"text": "Libby used 75 bricks of snow for her igloo. The bottom half of her igloo had 144 bricks of snow but the top half was smaller and had 56 bricks, meaning the total amount of bricks used for the igloo was 200. Since we know the height of the igloo and the number of bricks used in each half, we can calculate the number of bricks in each row.\nSince the bottom half had more bricks it would need three more rows compared to the top. Since there were 12 bricks in each row it means 24 bricks were put in each row of the bottom of the igloo, and 12 were put in each row for the top. Since we\u2019ve calculated that Libby used 10 rows of snow in total for her igloo, we can say there were a total of 240 bricks in the bottom half and 56 in the top, and since both halves of the igloo had equal shares of the total amount of brices used, we can conclude that Libby used 200 bricks of snow to build her igloo. \nAnswer: 200\n\n\n### Input Question: The pineapple is often considered a symbol of hospitality around the globe, and the story about the pineapple origin is thought to explain this.

One day when they came back they found the fruits sprouting and growing.

Upon finding the fruits germinating they were planted, leading to an abundance of pineapples, which were then offered to guests.\nRationales: The story has the following information: \n1.

Begin with \"chair,\" which is a very common item that could be placed on a bed.\n3. Then, examine \"pillow\" and \"blanket.\" These items clearly are meant to assist with the topic of sleep, such as a pillow for a child while they are at bed or the blanket to keep the child warm during the night.\n4. Next, look at \"bed\". A bed is the item that is primarily connected to the topic of \"sleep\" and is one type of item that is placed on a bed. This includes the bed frame as well as a pillow and blanket.\n5. Let\u2019s compare the other options. Option \"D\" is \"pillow.\" This is the option the student is choosing, and their goal is to select an item such that it is not related to the \"sleep\" topic.\n6. \"Pillow\" and \"sleep\" are strongly connected, and we can conclude that this does not belong.\n7.

{"text": "The answer is 2. This question is not asking about the number of more presents, but about the number of less presents. Remember, there are two halves of the year in this question which the author of the question did not differentiate. As a result, the answer could be different if the difference is only in the second half. So, that's not what the question is asking and Santana needs no more presents in total. Here is what we are doing: In order to solve this, we must draw a diagram representing dates and what they represent. The first half of the year is from January to June. The birthday gifts and Christmas gifts can't overlap or they will be counted twice. We can eliminate the birthday in December of one of the brothers so that they have the same number of gifts (7) in the two halves. So, birthday presents given on December 13th (2) and December 14th (1) are not counted because they are Christmas presents. Since Santana gives three birthday presents and one Christmas present, she needs 3 presents in the second half and one in the first half. Since there are 2 siblings born in December, that is not Santana's job and she doesn't need any more presents. Therefore, there is a discrepancy of 2 in each half of the year (Santana only gives 4 birthday presents in the first half). If there is a discrepancies of 2 for the first half of the day(6 - 4 = 2) and 4 in the second half (2 -1 = 3). Therefore 2+3 =5.

The fraction 50% means Tanika sold half as many boxes of crackers on Sunday as she did on Saturday.\nSo, since Tanika sold 60 boxes on Saturday and she sold half as much as that, she sold 6 = 30boxes on Sunday.\n\nAdding Saturday's number of boxes with Sunday's numbers of boxes, we get the number of boxes Tanika sold over the course of the weekend, namely 60 + 30 = 90boxes.\n\n\\[60 + 3\\frac{2}{5} = 90\\]\n\nThus, Tanika sold 90 boxes of crackers, in total.\n\n\\[90 = 60 + 5\\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nHence, Tanika sold 12 boxes of crackers on Saturday and 60 boxes of crackers on Monday, totaling 72 boxes.\n\n**Hints:**\n\nA) If you write 50%, you may think you will be able to subtract 50 from 100. The easiest way to do that is the following way:\n\nOn Sunday, Tanika sold 6 boxes more than she sold on Saturday. So after Tanika had sold 60 boxes that Saturday, she sold an additional 6 boxes. Now, instead of having 60 boxes she had 66, but this is not exactly what \"50% more\" means.\n\nB) To use the following way to subtract 50 percent from 100 you need two additional facts:\n\n* If Tanika had sold boxes on Saturday, then she had to have sold an equal number of boxes on Sunday. If she sold 60 on Saturday, she also needed to sell 60 boxes on Sunday.\n* Now 60 + 60 = 120, meaning Tanika sold enough boxes to make 120.\n\n\\[ \\underline{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{5}\\\\ \\overline{2} \\end{pmatrix} = 50 %\\]\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{\"The following equation is equivalent to dividing every 5", "answer": " 150"}

So either Flo wrote fewer books than Zig, or there's something wrong with the question. \n3. We can eliminate option A. \n4. Option B is incorrect for the same reason, and can be eliminated.\n5. Option E is incorrect for a different reason. \n6. If 60 books were written altogether, then Flo wrote at least one other book too, since 60 is larger than 4 by one.\n7. 60 is the correct answer.\n8.

Choices: A: back to space B: water fountain C: atmosphere D: spray E: back to the container\nRationales:\n1 This question is asking where aerosol containers \"go\" once they have been \"released.\"\n2. For each potential option, you should be looking to consider how the aerosol ends up once it has been released into the air.\n  Option A: If you were to put an aerosol in a water fountain, it would not be released since there is no way for it to leave the water fountain.\n3. Option B: The atmosphere is air filled with water vapor, oxygen, and different types of airborne dust that make up our skies. So if one was to \"release\" an aerosol, it would likely become part of this cloud of air that we call the atmosphere since it would no longer belong to the original container.\n  Option C: An aerosol released without a container could simply drift in the air, without being affected by the atmosphere in any particular way.\n  Option D: If an aerosol is released in a spray bottle, it would be absorbed by the spray bottle as the spray container does not let it escape, rather it simply contains the liquid.\n4. Option E: If you were to release an aerosol without a spray container and it was not affected by the ambient atmosphere, it could likely return to wherever", "answer": " 75"}

It isn't \"50\" because he isn't keeping \"50%\" of the remaining tadpoles and we only have 18. B. He can't drop 3 tadpoles, because he keeps more than that (keep 18, drop 15 - 77%). C.

{"text": "### Instruction answer: Jenny still spent half of her original amount\n\n### Demostration answer: First, let's think about the statement in this problem. After spending a fraction of her money, Jenny still has half of her original amount. Therefore, Jenny could not possibly ever get to $0 by spending any more money. In other words, we know that Jenny still has half her original amount even after all of her money is gone.\n### Rationales:\n#### Explanation Answer:\nLiquid money is $24. Jenny has spent 3/7 or $3 dollars worth of it or 42% of her liquid money. She has $24 left after the $3.\nJenny has only $21 left. $21/2 = $10.50. so Jenny has half her original money left.\n\n#### Explanation Demonstration Answer:\n$24 / 2  =$12 so Jenny still has half original amount\n\n#### Explanion Instuction Answer:\nJenny does not spend half of her original amount because she does not have a total of the original amount.\nJenny's original amount was $38. After spending $3, Jenny is left with $24. \n\n$21$ is half the original amount.\nAfter spending $1$ Jenny is left with only $8$.\n\n$10$ is half of the original amount. \n\nShe lost $10$ and she has not spent half of the original amount because she already lost half her money without spending any.\n\n$5$ is half the original remaining amount. \n\nJenny loses $5$ dollars and she is gone after spending $21$.\n\n$3$ is half of what Jenny has left $24-3 \\le 24-6 = 18$. \n\nJen loses $3$ and she spent all her liquid money of $24$. \n\n$1.5$ is half the remaining amount.\n\nWhen Jen spends $1.5$ dollars after losing her original number, she loses half of the liquid money.\n\n$0.75$ is half the liquid money.\n$9.25", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "John buys 50-liter tanks.\n\n### Explanation:Answer: (John buys 5 liters of gas, because 500 liters of air in the tank hold the same amount as 1000 helium balloons)\n    1. If John buys 10 liters or more of gas, he will run out of balloons.\n    2. Hence, the answer must be one of the 10-liter tanks, not the 500-liters tank.\n    3. We can buy one of the 1-liter tanks (10 x $1 = $10) or one of the 5 liter tanks (6 x $5 = $30).\n    4. Hence, it's cheaper to buy the less expensive 5-liter tank\n    5. John buys the cheaper 5-liter tank, which holds the same amount of gas as 50 liters of balloons.  500 liters divided by 50 liters is 10.\n\n\n### Instructions:\"What is in an empty room?\"Answer: The answer is, 'everything'.\n\n### Examples:\n1.

The question is clearly worded, and it's understood that our task is to complete the formula.\n2. However, note that the formula appears to contain some subtraction and multiplication operations.\n3. Subtraction is represented by the minus symbol (\"-\"), and multiplication is the symbol for an \"X\", and each of these can be either positive or negative.\n4. The equation also seems to be using parentheses, and each row can also be either positive or negative, with the exception of \"3\", which must always be positive.\n5. Since it's hard to immediately determine the sign of the other operations, we will assume that each operation will have a negative sign since the values from the parentheses are positive.\n6. Based on this reasoning, the operation is: [(18 + 9) / (3 * -9)] / -24\n7. Based on the initial step, we can simplify the operation: [(18 + -24) / (9 * -9)]\n8. Therefore, the formula for the complete equation is: [(18/18) + [(19/9) - -24]/18 - 18]\n9.

The question is about how much time a person will have spent jogging after 2 weeks if they jog regularly for an hour and a half per day.\n2. Let us analyze the options carefully to understand why the answer is what it is:\n3. Option A says \"Mr. John jogged for 1 hour 26 minutes for 2 weeks.\" This would mean that Mr. John has already spent 2 hours and 16 minutes on jogging before the 2 weeks are complete.\n4. Option D: \"He did not jog for one week.\" This means Mr. John hasn't done any jogging the week before. But this could also mean that he has not started jogging yet.\n5. Option E: \"He spent five hours.\" This makes no sense and is contradictory to the question. Mr. John should spend more time jogging if he is going to spend 3 hours and 40 minutes, making no sense.\n6. Option B and C contain the same information. But B tells us that \"Mr. John could have either spent one hour and 20 minutes or 2\" hours and 40\" minutes.

So the bird is flying higher above the skyscrape. Using P=1/sin(H), we can calculate the reduction in height to the ground caused by the bird'smiddle height H.

Choices: A: Alex is better at bass than John is at guitar B: John will have a hard time playing bass with Alex C: Alex is in the band D: John knows more about bass instruments than Alex does`\n\n### Demostration:\nJohn and Alex are talking. John tells Alex that \"he\" plays guitar and is better. So John may think she does not play guitar. Then, \"he\" asked Alex if she plays any other instrument, instead of saying nothing. \nSo from what John says, we can know that John is a male and Alex is a female. Alex says \"she\" plays bass. But John does not say the same thing. That means Alex is better at bass, but John is not a good. John thinks that \"she\" will have a hard time to play bass with him, instead of saying if \"she\" is a good bass player. John knows more about bass than Alex.\n\n### Rationales:\n- John and Alex are talking about John: guitar, Alex: bass.\n- John tells Alex that \"I\" play bass, but \"she\" is much better than me. John doesn't say that Alex is not playing bass.\n- Alex says \"I\" plays bass, but John will have a hard(?) time playing bass with me because I'm a(n) beginner. John says Alex is not a beginner, but he doesn't say the opposite.\n- Alex doesn't say \"she knows much more than me about bass instruments.\" John is already sure about it.John says \"I\" play guitar better than Alex.

{"text": "Lizzie has 6. This was a tricky problem because it was confusing to me how Billie has 15 crayons and Bobbie has three times that, so the answer doesn't seem to make too much logical sense.\n\n### Rationale:\nAll three girls have crayons of different amounts, but at the end it turns out that Lizzie has just as many crayons. We will assume that they only have regular-colored crayons and that there are no other crayons that can complicate the problem.\n \nFirst, Lizzie has half as much as Bobbie. Since Bobbie has three times the amount of crayons as Bill, that means Bobbie has 36 crayons, so Lizzie has three-sixths which would be three fifths of the total. Three fifths of 36 is 14, so Lizzie would have 14 total (crayons).\n\nNow for Billie.  If Billie has 4 crayons more than Lizzie,  she will also have twice as many as Lizzie.  It is logical to assume that Bobbie has almost double the amount as Billie, but Bobbie does in fact have one third the amount. If Billie and Bobbie have 3 times as many crayosns, then it is logical that Billie has 1/3 the amount.  So Billie has 4 more crayons than Lizzie since they have half as many as each other, and that means 4 fifths of 3 is 25 and 27 fifths of 3 goes into each other 26 times. So Billie has 26, and that means that Lizzie has 14 - 26 =12 left.\n\nNext, since Lizzie has 8 fewer than Bobbie, they all have six.  They all have 6 crayons in total.\n\n### Input\n \n### Instruction\nWhat is your favorite number?

{"text": "Hannah should use 80 cups of flour in order to utilize all of the bananas, as each cup of mush requires 3 cups of mush.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. The question asks for the number of cups of flour that Hannah should use in order to make 80 cups.\n2. We can see that each cup of mush needs 3 cups of banana mush, and there are 4 bananas per cup, so to make 4 cups of mush, we need 16 bananas.\n3. Hannah has 20 bananas. According to the formula above, this means that she needs to use 50 cups of flours in order to make all of the cups of mush that she needs.\n4. However, Hannah's recipe requires Hannah to use 3 cuph of flour for each cup of mush, so in order to use these 50 cups, Hannah actually needs 167 cups of flour (50 cups of 3, 3 cups in a cup).\n5. So, the correct answer is 80 cups\nAnswer: 80 cups", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "$45\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We need to find the price of cheddar cheeese, and the price of cream cheese. So Jasper will spend $25 to get 3 pounds of cheese. We can divide the amount of cheese by the total price to get the cheese that is in every 1 pound. The final answer is that the cheddar cheeze and cream cheese cost $11.33 each.\n2. We can find the price for the charcuterie by adding up the cost of the cheddar and cream cheeze. We have $11.34 in cheddar cheezer and cream cheezer, and we need to add in the price of cold cuts. We can't get the final pricce of the cold cuts, until we find how much cheese and cheeze Jasper brought. So we subtract $11 in cheese from $45.

We now have 85 of the first 175, which we subtract from our number to determine 85-175 = 90 to find 2/5 to hit. The other 55 balls we also subtract from our 175. Hence, I know that my answer is 85 + 2/5 - 55 which equals 30. Then, when I multiply 30 by 3 to find the other balls he misses, it's 30 x 3 = 90. So, finally my answer is 84 which is more precise than 90 because there are 4 balls in each of the 100 and 15's in each of the 75.\n\n\n1.

You recommend a driving instruction website to her, and she visits https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cornwall/\n\n### Response:(The two options below are not correct.)\n- A: A way to calculate the fastest route through a map is to calculate the distance between the start and the end. For example, the distance from California to New York would be a straight line, whereas the distance from California to the South Pole would be a curved line.\n- B: Google's algorithm assumes that the route will only contain straight lines: every turn is on a different straight line.\n### Rationales: \n1. Let's focus on the phrase \"through a map.\" \"Through a map\" is generally understood as \"with a map.\" Since the task states that the answer would be from the perspective of someone \"who knows how to drive a [car],\" he or she is unlikely to ask a website to \"find the fastest route.\" The question is asking for a way to determine the fastest route, and it implies that this would be from a person \"with a map\" who knows how to drive.\n2. \"Calculate the distance between the start\" and the \"end\" is exactly what you would do when you wanted to find the distance on a map. That means \"the fasted route\" is the route with the shortest total distance.\n3. The first option does not provide an answer to the question \"how to calculate the fastest shortest?\" It just suggests that the fastest route would be the shortest one, which is not the case.\n4.

{"text": "The bear gained about 200 pounds of its remaining 800 pounds by devouring 400 pounds of small forest animals,\n\n### Explanation\n\n\nLet us suppose the bear has already gained 800 pounds.\n\n- 1000 in total:\n   - 500 + 500 from berries during summer = 1000\nThis means, we have no option for the first line.\n- To understand the 800, lets have a look at the three lines.\n\nIf we subtract (During Autumn):\n\n- 500 + x from 800 = 500 + (2x - 500) = 100  x = 500\n\nIf we take away (During Summer):\n\n- 200 + x from x = 200 + (2.5x - 200) = 900  x = (400-200) =600\n\nWe can say that at this present stage (without eating small animals) it already has 800 pound.\n\nHowever, let us now say the bear gained 200 in the autumn. (x is now 100 to match the earlier calculation which made up the total of 800 pounds)\n\nLet us now remove the second line from our equation.\n\nIf we take (During Autumn).\nThen:\n\n- 5(100) + x = 20  => x = 1.66\n\nThis can be verified as a result of:\n(During Summer) + (During Autumn) + (During Winter).\n\nSo the bear gained 2x pound (2x=1000 - 800). This gives a result 100, which means it gained 100 pound from devouring 450 small animals.\nTherefore, we can conclude by dividing the three lines into the weight that the bear gained.\n\n### Result\nTo calculate the amount of time the bear took its hibernation in winter:\n\nIt will be: 400+100=500+(800-500", "answer": " 200"}

None of the above refers to the fact that the person should not be surprised by any of the factors above.\n5. Hence, there is not a single option from the given choices which correctly identifies the situation in context. The person can be surprised by any of these four factors: the size of the gift, its value, and quality, and for it to be surprising this would have to not be the case.\n6.

Choices: A: cherry B: cherries C: strawberries D: strawberry syrup E: whipped cream\nRationales: The question asks: 'What was on top of the Cake?'\n\n2. This kind of question is usually asked to get at the'main idea' or a key detail. \n\ni) A: Nope, we're not looking for a 'cherry', as such. The question wants an answer that is part of what is 'on top of the cake' and not what the entire cake is made of. Thus, we can remove 'cherry' as a possible answer.\n\nii) B: We can also not choose 'cherries', as the plural form doesn\u2019t help us narrow in on a particular option. 'Cherries on top of the cakes' implies that there are several of them. \n\niii) C: The answer of'strawberries' doesn't suit us either, for the same reason as the previous, it implies several rather than one. \n\niv) D: 'Strawberry syrup' is one possible item that may be on top the cake, however this is not necessarily the main idea or key detail we are looking for. \n\nv) E: 'whipped cream' definitely wouldn't be on top of the caked per se. \n\nBased on the exclusion of the options listed above, 'whipped cream', is the most logical possibility. The question wants you to choose the item that was 'on top of the Cake', and whipped cream meets that criterion. \n\nH", "answer": " 5"}

Since she is bringing 6 tubes, each of which hold 2 tubes of makeup, she needs 12 to fill her buffer. So she has enough for everyone's needs and 1.5 extra. There will be 7.5 more people than lip gloss.\n\n### Rational:  The way I logically arrived at this answer is by doing the math to determine how many tubes of makeup are needed (12) and determining that it will be enough, leaving 7.5 people without makeup.\n\n### Input (Part 2):Jimmy asks the class if it's okay if he comes into class in his pajamas after a night in the hospital. The math teacher, Joe, asks what happened, Jimmy says that the principal got him on charges of skipping, Joe asks how Jimmy responded because it matters what kind of day he's having, Jimmy doesn't answer and then goes silent.\n\n### Response (Part 2):This scenario is hard to answer at first glance because of the ambiguity of the words. After some rephrasing and thinking, Jimmy has said he's in the hospital and was charged with skipping. This could be true because there's a good chance of getting charged in any scenario so the principal might have charged him. Therefore, I believe that Jimmy is not in the hospital and is only telling Joe to lie to him about his skipping because he does not want to answer him.\n\n### I believe this because after Jimmy says he's in the Hospital, he says \"it matters what kind of day I'm having\" and then doesn't respond. The skipping part could make his day worse because if the principal is just going to charge him he could be facing a real night in the hospital. This is why I think Jimmy is lying to avoid skipping.\n\n### The rational:  The phrase \"it matters what kind\" can mean that whatever response Joe gives Jimmy in response will affect him. I think this is true because if Joe responds that they skipped then Jimmy is in even more trouble. If Joe asks him if he skipped school though which does not matter whether or not he responds,", "answer": " 36"}

We need to multiply 6/40 by 8 and get 24. Six goats is half of four hundred, or two hundred. So we take two hundred and multiply it by four, or four hundred. You get eight hundred by multiplying 6/40 times 4, we also need to multiply six times 8, which is eighty. Six is half of four hundred so we multiply it by 80, four hundred and eighty six or 806.

This is the question that asks a simple query about the situation in which a bird on a perch observes other birds in their perches nearby.\n\nThere are several options for what the bird on a perch may observe:\n    - shadow: the bird could be watching its own shadow, but this doesn't fit the question which asks for the observation of things \"other than a bird.\"\n    - reflection: the bird may be watching its own reflection, but this is not what is being asked.\n    - something else: this may be an option but it only refers to the objects that the bird may be watching, as opposed to what would be watching the bird?\n    - bigger bird: the bird may also be watching something bigger than itself; so we can eliminate this option.\n    - something other than a bird: this means that the bird may be observing other things other than a bird; hence this is definitely the correct answer.\n1b.

It refers to the action of hiding or camouflage a structure rather than a location within a house where items may be stored.\n3) Option F is not a basic, necessary function since sleeping in a house isn't required, but it might be an action.\n\nHence, we can safely eliminate C: making noise, D: protecting, and F: sleeping. \n4) In this scenario, B: cooking food, option C: making noise, and E: hiding things will not be selected since option D: protecting isn't considered a basic component of the structure, which would mean they wouldn't necessarily be included in the question.\n5) Based on this analysis and the rules of inference, the correct answer is A: cooking, making, storing, and sleep.\nAnswer: A. \n\n### Instructions:\nComplete the passage by dragging the right word to the highlighted box to make a correct sentence\n\n### Demostration:\nIf all goes well you will be on your way in no time.\nIf all goes well, you will be on your own way.\n\n###", "answer": " 24"}

They are birds is an incorrectly given answer. The question asks to identify what is not the same about these four critters. \n2. Birds do not share a common factor with the other three selections. To see this, we can substitute the birds for the other options to test if they still remain valid. \n3. If we substitute birds for E: They have 2.24 claws, we see that the question still holds true as: There are many animals that have 2.25 clairs; so while the number of caws in each selection may be different, the number of caws is clearly not the same between the four animals.\n4. Similarly, if we replace birds for D: Rodents, we conclude that the question is still true: There are many animals with more than 4.2 letters in their names; so while the word may vary between the four animals, it is not clear if the length of the word is the same. \n5. Therefore, by analyzing the other three options, we could conclude that they are not the same because not all of them meet the criterion used to select the incorrect answer.\n6. Therefore, D: Rodents is the incorrect option that is not the same about four animals as required in the question.\n\n## Input: In the sentence below, where does", "answer": " 96"}

XXX gallons\n2. XX gallons\n\n### Answer:\n\n2\n\n### Rationale:\n\nWhich of the following statements could be correct?\n\na) Total gallons of water used = 4 (light) + 3 + 1 (light) = 8\n\nb) Total gallons of bleach used = 2 (light) + 2 (regular) + 1 (regular) = 5\n\nc) Total gallons used = 2+3+1 = 6\n\nTotal gallons of water used will be XX (XX wash) = XX+XX. We know that XX (XX wash + light) = 20. We aren't told how many light and heavy washes are required.\n\nTo determine how much bleach is used, you need to determine how many light, regular, and heavy washes there will be. Because two of the loads need to have bleach, there will be one regular and one light cycle. Total gallons of bleached need to be 2 + 2 (regular + light).\n\nc) Total Gallons used = XX + XX\n\nTotal Gallons of water used will = XX + XX\nTotal gallons of bleach will = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n### Sample Solutions To Other Tasks:\n\n* [TASK1_QA](https://github.com", "answer": " 76"}

{"text": "The answer is A: 54. If the total number eggs were 400 and 10 extra in the first round, then that should be 410 - that means that Tank gathered 110 eggs in total. That leaves us with 56 more eggs but subtracting her 60 eggs gets us to 24, that's why Emma gathered twice as many, meaning 120 eggs in the second round. Then she has 120 subtracted from 110, we get 90 extra eggs from Emma. Lastly there are 6 other egg hunts, that is 153 more, that gives us 105 total more eggs from Emma's teammates. Lastly, that puts Emma's eggs at 215.\n\n### Example Answers\n##### A: John \n\n##### D: Dad\n\n##### G: Dog \n\n##### B: The \n\n##### C: Dog\n\n##### Dad is the father of the dog.\n\n##### This is because the speaker (the narrator, probably the dad because he's asking what their dog would think) sees \"the dog\" and \"the\" in the same way. They think of \"the dog,\" not the \"d\", and they think of the word more as a whole.\n\n##### John is the brother of Mary.\nThis is because the speaker (John) knows what Mary's name is, but is asking what John (the speaker) would do if he met his sister. Since the speaker knows what Mary is, he is not looking at it as the individual letters or the entire word \"Mary,\" rather he is referencing it as an object he knows about, therefore he thinks of \"John\" in the same way, as it is an object to him.\n\n##### Dog is the owner of the dog\nThis is because the dog owner (John) is the father of the son (Dad).\nAs a result, the dog owners thinks of \"dog\" as an object, not thinking about the individual letters or the word \"dog\" itself.\n\n### Other resources\n1.

Choices: A: resting B: thinking C: dreaming D: drinking E: making progress\nRationales:  1. This question involves the idea of working towards completing something. \n2. In order to answer the question, we need to consider what actions a person might be taking when they are working towards completion of something. By looking at each of the options and analyzing the situation, we see that:  \na. option A, resting, would not be an appropriate answer for a person working towards completing something because resting would not move them towards completion.\nb. option B, thinking, could be a part of the process of working towards completion but does not capture the whole process.\nc. D, drinking, could take up time, but drinking is more suited for enjoyment or relaxation than completion.\nd. option E, making progress, is a more accurate representation of the overall process because'making progress' is a more holistic action that encompasses thinking, resting, and drinking. \n3.

The symbol for this, is the exclamation point, because it \"signifies 'the total of the numbers from 1 to x.\" [@daviddesmond](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2944597/11422842) says that \"the factorial of 2 is 2*1; for 3, the factorial is 3*2*1; for the more familiar 5, it is 5*4*3*2*1.\" From this we can see that the factorial of 7 is 5*4 = 20. \n\n![Factorial](https://mathbits.com/mathbits/Images/factorial.gif)\n\nOur two friends Samuel and Cathy made two purchases of doughnuts. So we need to consider how to distribute 20 doughnuts among the group of 8 people. First, each doughnut costs 2 dollars and each group is receiving 100 shares. To distribute doughnights evenly in this situation, we break down the number 100 into its prime factor, 2. This indicates that there should be 7 groups receiving 7 shares a piece, and one person receiving 1 share as the extra piece. However, if we consider distributing the doughnuts between one friend that ordered 20 and one friend that ordered 3, then the group of 10 would get 20. Then the group of 8 would get 3. Then the group of one would get 2. \n\n![share doughnuts](./assets/images/shareDoughnuts.png)\n\n### Input-Output :\n\n#### Input: This is a problem about", "answer": " 6"}

By understanding the context, we find that the question is asking for the ratio of the speed at which the plane navigated against the speed of the plane.\n2. To figure out the ratio, we take the speed of the plane (in mph) and divide it by the wind speed (also in mph).

A: radiation of 5000k \n2. B: 50,000k radiation \n3. C: 50,100k radiation 34\n\nRationales\n1. The question asks what type of radiation the sun emits when it has a temperature of 500 k.\n2. To correctly answer, the most important thing is to note the precise temperature of the sun. The sun is known to emit a lot of energy, but there is no specific information if the energy was emitted at 500,100, 5000, etc degrees. To answer this, we have to determine whether the sun emit radiation at the temp of 500k or at 5000 k.\n3. Since 500 k is the exact temperature at which the sun emits the most radiation we can safely say that the sun only emits 500k radiation and not much else. Hence, the answer has to be 1. A: 500 k radiation. \n\n### Input2\nIn an infinite pool, 45 people are swimming in a circle.

There is no restaurant in the bear's forest and the bear is not capable to buy or ride a vehicle because bears do not have paws and they cannot walk. There is no mall in the forest either. So the answer for question is a bear would go to a shopping malls.\n\n### So the answer would the forest.\n\n### Input Question: What can you do on your way home after going to a baseball game?

It doesn't make sense to go to a restaurant because you're leaving right the next day so you want to be able to eat a delicious meal, not have it be cold from hours of sitting on your way home. Aside from that you could be going to another place that is on your way home.

{"text": "A: eight\n\n### Rationales: The river width is 42 feet, and the boats are 3 feet long. So, the boats must be at least 2 feet apart from the riverbanks. For this to be possible, each boat must occupy half of each riverbank. In order to accommodate another boat, the boats would have to move closer to each other.\nAs a result, there's only room for four additional boats, for a total of eight boats. You can find the boats' spacing via the following:\n```\na = 2\nb = 41\n\n(3-2)a = b\n\nb = 42\n\n(a/3)b = b\n\na/3 = b/4\n\na/12 = b/16\n```\nYou can double check this by putting this in the calculator and finding that\n```\n(1/3)12 = 16/4\n```\nOr\n```\n16/12 = 4/3\n```\n### Input:Which of the following actions can humans accomplish?

{"text": "We can find the number of cars that he needs to sell to meet the quota as 23.\n\n### Rationale: The given data describes the number of cars that Frank sells over a period of time.\n\n### We can identify the period of time to be a day from the given information as well as the average number of 5 cars he sold over that period.\n\n### Let n = the number of cars to be sold in the remaining days of the month. Now, if he sold cars at an average of 5 every day, then the total number of cars sold in the whole month would be 5 * 30 = 150 and the number unsold is 150 - 105 = 45. He has already sold 105, so the first equation is thus, n = 105 - 45 = 60.\n\n### Another way of solving the above problem is to set the equation n = 45 + m where m denotes the number of days remaining and then 50 -5 = 45, therefore n = 100. Since the given information gives that he sold a total of 150 cars in 30 days, the m in the equation n = 102 - 45 is easily calculated to get the answer as 55. Since he sold a total of (105 - 105) = 0 cars in 10 days, we can calculate the remaining amount as 105 - (3 * 5) = 60 cars.\n\n### In general, we can set the first equation n=105- 45 as n+ 45 = 105 for any number p. Using 0, now, we get that n+0 = 105. That is, 0 = 102.\n\n### Hence, 45 = 0 (as the value of '0' ) and thus p = 1. Hence, the answer would be: n = 45+1 = 46.\n### Hence the answer we arrived at by applying different logic can be combined in a succinct manner. Thus, the answer is 23.", "answer": " 23"}

While it's true that elephants can attract mates using items such as carrots, this is not what we are being asked. \nLet's dismiss this option. \n\nNow, let's look at C: Attract the opposite gender, since the carrot can attract the opposite gender, yes", "answer": " 7"}

One of its distinguishing features is the use of a wheel (or wheels) in front of another, the latter of which may be smaller. In addition, this form of transportation doesn't weigh less but it has a bigger wheel in front. This discrepancy may be accounted for in terms of balance, efficiency, or other factors such as those mentioned above. The front wheel of the bicycle may be considered bigger because it is necessary for balance, hence reducing the weight. Bigger wheel fronts aid riders in maintaining a controlled and steady equilibrium of their bikes. In addition, efficiency is another significant factor to take into account. A smaller wheel at the back provides for more stability, since the larger wheels at the front enable the bicycle to travel at higher speeds and more quickly. Finally, this mode of transportation may have a front wheel that is bigger than a back wheel that is smaller due to other specifications, such as the rider's height or weight.", "answer": " 125"}

For the family of five, the number of guests is 5. The owner may have had more than one family at a time, but this is no longer relevant to the question.\n3. Now total this number for all of the families at the restaurant, which is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.\n4. Similarly, for those that are out of 8 guests, 8 guests at once.

(2 groups + 20 members) The guests include 40 families from the bride + grooms extended families + 140 of their regular friends = 180 people total.\n\n### Justify:It was assumed that the family members invited an even number of people, so we will group them by counting the amount of family members on the bride's side and then subtracting that from the family members on the groom's side.  This way we should get 80 people left for friends.\nThe total amount of people attending the wedding is 40+80+140= 260.

{"text": "The correct answer is D: $270.\n\n### Explanation:\nIn this scenario, Lance's total earnings for the holiday season would be $270. Here are the steps to reach this answer:\n\n* We know that Lance works 35 hours spread over 5 workdays, for a total of 17.5 hours per day.\n* Since Lance earns $8 an hour, that means he earns $17.25 per hour at this job. In turn, that means Lance earns 17.5 * $8, or $140 per day.\n* We know that $270 is the sum of all of Lance's 5 workdays' worth of earnings, and since he earns $140 per workday, we understand that $270 must total five $140 workdays on top of the one time he was paid for the entire job upon the start of the holiday season. \n\nWe've already accounted for Lance's wages for all five workdays, so the only answer not accounted for is the $270 Lance earned for the first day, for the total of six days with an allotment of $270.  \nSince Lance earns $144 for his 17.5-hour first day, all that's left to figure out is how much he earned for the other five days. \n\nWe can see that each day Lance's wage increases by $25, from $140 to $165, adding up to a total of $825.  \n\nSubtracting this from the total amount of $270 we have so far results in $185, so we can conclude that $185 is the remaining amount Lance earned for the other five consecutive workdays.", "answer": " 63"}

If there are 90 sheep in the pen, what was the percentage that the dog managed to bring back into the pasture?\n\n### Rationales : The question is asking about the percentage of Carla's sheep that her dog brought back into the pasture.\n\n### First, there is an assumption that, after rounding 90 percent of Carla's original sheep (90 sheep), there are 81 remaining sheep, which are the ones that are left behind in the pasture. \nThis is made clear in the last part of the question when it says that the dog finished and there are still 81 sheep when finished \n\n\n### Second, there is an assumption about the number of sheep that the dog brought back into the pen.\n\n### If the dog 90 sheep to the pasture, then there must be 10 sheep that are left out in the hills.

{"text": "3 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 11 pounds.\n\n### The reasoning behind the answer:\n\nFirst, we do the following calculation to help us make sense of the given details:\n\nWe know that Harry made a custom creation by using blue and green weights. This is because Harry is the only individual mentioned who made a bar on which weights were put. For this reason, we can say that Harry was the one who arranged the objects on a bar. Let's think about the bar itself.\n\nThe bar is of a special material that may or may not have any significance to how it weighs. Hence, in this instance we aren't thinking about the material's effect on its weight. Therefore, in order to weigh the bar, Harry simply needs to add the number of blue weights and the number of green weights. The bar itself and its material weighs 2.\n\nNow onto the weights themselves:\n\nThere are two categories of weights. Blue weights go at 2 pounds each whereas green weights go at 3 pounds each. This means that:\n\n$p_{blue}w_{blue} = 2\\text{ pounds}, p_{blue} = 1 \\, \\ w_{blue} = 0.5\\text{ pounds}$\n\n$p_{green}w_{green} = 3\\text{ pounds},p_{green} = 1.5\\text{pounds},\\ w_{green} = 2\\hbox{ pounds}$\n\nIf we assume that Harry put $4$ blue weights on the bar then the following will be the arrangement on the weights:\n\n$p_4$ weights on the bar\n\n$0.5$ pounds per weight\n\n$1.5$ pounds per each additional weight\n\n$2$ pounds per last weight\n\nHence a total of 4 pounds.\n\nNow let's take into consideration the amount of green weights Harry put on the bar:\n\nThe formula for number of green and blue weights is:\n\n$w_{total} = p_{total}\\ w_{total}$\n\nwhere: p - total number of each weight\n\n$\\ w_{total}\\ $ - Total weight.\n\nThe problem states the numbers of blue and green weights as well as the total number of weights.\n\nWe simply need to plug in these numbers into the formula and re-", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": "Bert was able earn twice as much as Tory (by a total of $8)\n\n### Explanation:\n1. Bert sold 8 toys for $18 each and Tory sold 7 toys for $20 each\n2. $18 dollars = $20 dollars * 0.5 (which is to say that $18 dollars is half of $20 dollars)  \n3. So, each toy in Bert's case earned $2 (which is to say $18 dollars / $9 = $2)\n4. So, in that case that would mean that Bert earned 8 toys * $2 (which is $16 or $16.00)\n5. Then on the other hand, Bert sold 8 toy phonies for $18 each meaning that each toy cost $18 dollars (as it sells for $18)\n6. Then Tory sold 7 guns for $20 dollars each, so the toy would cost $20 dollars each (since it sells for $20)\n7. In total, Bert earned twice as much as Torry\n8.

{"text": "60 / 18 / 210 = 14.4 seconds\n\n### Justification:One can assume that the speed at which a cheetah runs is 60 mph or 60 miles per hour. Thus the rate of running is equivalent to 28 feet per second. The speed at which a gazelle can run has been stated as 40 mph or 40 miles per second. Thus the rate of gazelle running is represented as 22 feet per second.\n\nThe two animals will be initially in two different spots and will also be traveling in two different directions. However, 1.5 feet represent 1 mile. If one would travel one mile in every one foot while traveling at a particular speed, then one could conclude that to move 210 feet would require 210/28 or 210/58, which can be simplified to say 3.7 miles. It is worth noting that a cheetah can attain top speed in a span of 1.9 miles. (Taking this into consideration, therefore the number of seconds needed to travel 3.7 miles is: 3.7/1.9 = 2. However, when the cheetah and gazelle travel in the same direction, the cheetah would overtake the target after traversing three quarters of a mile. Consequently, to overtake this milestone, the cheetah needs 3.7/0.7 = 5.3 seconds.\n\nAccordingly, to get 210 feet away from the cheetah, the gazelle would travel 210-3.7 or 210 minus 3.7 equals 196.2 feet. \nTo cover this distance, the gazelle will require 5.3 x 196.91 = 1041.7 feet.\nTo cover this distance the gazelle would require 5.3 seconds x 1969.68/22 = 1033 seconds = 103.5 seconds\n\nIn conclusion, one can say that the cheetah needs to cover 1000 feet in 3 seconds, while the gazelle does not need to cover any more distance, hence the solution to the given problem is that the cheetah over", "answer": " 7"}

It's not what people give when someone does better than them.\n\nD. Although it's a fact that people give gifts to a subjected person it is not a thing what people commonly give. People may give this as a sign of appreciation.\n\nTherefore, there is little relevance between the options and the question, making a certificate a good answer for the question.\n\n## Reference\nhttps://medium.com/@frankie/sentence-to-word-riddles-", "answer": " 42"}

However, looking at the other letters beside the E, it is not clear if E can be the answer. The question is asking about 2-letter words, so there are 4 possibilities, ABCD. \n3.

{"text": "This block of flats can accommodate a total of 48 residents. 8 flats out of the 12 have 5 apartments and therefore can host 5 more residents than the others. Similarly, 4 flats out of 12 can host 4 more residents than others as they have 6 apartments instead of 5. Therefore, this block of flats can host a total of 49 residents with 5 in each flat with 6 apartments and 4 in each flat with 5 apartments. It is possible that the final residents could be housed between 2 homes but all in all this block has a total of 42 homes for a maximum of 49 residents. Thus, the answer is 48 residents.\n\n### Response2:\nBased on the question, the block of flats is a collection of 12 floors with some number of apartments. Each apartment can generally host a maximum of 4 people and this block of flats has 6 apartments which can host 4 more. The question is also telling us that the other half of the flats have 5 apartments which can host one more person. The way to determine the maximum number of residents one can accommodate is through the use of binomial theorem.\n\nThe binomial theorem tells us that nCr is equal to the formula for the number of combinations\n\nnCk = (n) k! / (k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k -3) * * (k - n + 1))\n\nSince the block is a collection of 6 and 5 flats which can host 4 and 5 residents respectively the numerator is equal to:\n\n(6 - 1) * ((6 - 1)*(6 - 2)*(6 -3)*(6 - 4)* * (5 - 2)) = 31\n\nAs the formula for the denominator is k * (k - 5), the equation for the number of combinations is therefore 31.

{"text": "Fred had 14 dollars in his allowance. This implies that he had spent 28 dollars on things like the movies and the car wash. 28 divided by 2, the number of movies he went to, is 14.

We can see that the question gives us information about the money involved.\n2. For the most part, we can use these types of math problems with addition and subtraction to find the value.\n3.

Because of this, we will need to start at the end and work to the beginning. \n5. To do that:\n6. We first subtract 'earn' from 'allowance.' That is '14 - 6 = 8'\n7. Then, we subtract'save' from 'allowance' '14 - 14 = 0'\n8. Because we subtracted by the same amount, we then end up with the amount available to spend, '14 - 8 = 6'\n9. We know now that he had to spend half his allowance on movies and he spent half of 28, so we want to find out how much he spent on the movies.\n10.

{"text": "1. The first thing to note is the word \"some\". \"Some\" means a small number.\n2. It could help to remember that not all numbers are whole numbers. Therefore, it helps to write everything in the problem using fractions.\n3. What we mean is, when working with a problem where we need to decide the total amount of money, we can take a whole number of money out each time we divide the fraction by two.\n4. For example, I could write 1/2 as 0.5 and I could even take half a dollar out of an amount to see a half dollar.\n5. The first step, to determine how many kids are in camp would be to get a proportion that is going to help us solve this.\n6. For a simple way to solve this, we would say 750 + 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/2 which equals 3/4.\n7. We then know that 750+1/4 = 3/4. Now, it just depends on what operation you want to do to solve this.\n8. In this particular case, since we said that \"some\" meant, \"a small amount\" and we divided 1/4 by 2 to get 1/8, so we knew that 3/4 = 8/2.\n9. 1/8 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n10. 4/2 = 2.

Choices:  B: stand there and sell things C: run around E: make decisions D: ring a bell E: help people pay\nRationales: The question asks about what do mall employees do during a bustle day at the mall.\n1. Let's first consider the possible options.\n- A: selling things, E: help people pay and ringing a bell: B: standing there.\n2. Let us analyze each option:\n- A: Selling things: The mall employee can only sell the things during the time and place in which they are permitted to sell, so selling things outside of their time and place is not possible for the mall employee.\n- E: Help people pay and ringing bell: the MAL is not the place to ring a bell and it is not a place where people pay, either.\n3. It is hard to consider the options like choosing, deciding, making money, because these options are not specific or related to the job of a MAL worker.\n4. So we should consider only B: \"stands\" and C: \"runs\" as the possible options. \n5. B: \"stands there\" and C: \"rings\" are clearly inconsistent with the question.\n6. Moreover, we cannot consider C: \"runing\" because it makes no sense for the mall employee to run about during a customer's visit.\n7.

{"text": "Jake drank 12 ounces of alcohol.\nRationales: To solve this problem, we will determine Jake's alcohol by quantity instead of by volume, because the question only indicates the percentage of alcohol as \"50%.\" This is equivalent to 49 ml since there are 100 ml in an ounce.\nFirst, we will calculate how much pure alcohol Jake consumed by volume. Then, we will calculate how many ounces this is equivalent to.\nThe question says that each shot of vodka contains 1.5 ounce (1.5 x 29.57353 = 44.26382)\n\nEach of Jake's shots are 1.5 ousndes and so 1.5 x 8 shots equals 12 ounses.\n\nTherefore, 12 oun=0.75 l.\n1.5 l=0.75 oun\nx 50%\n50% is equivalent to 44.2ml, so we subtract this to get 0.75 ounce\n0.75 x 295ml\n75ml x (29./100)= 24 ounce\nTherefore, Jake consumed 1.2 ounce, and 100% alcohol was in 100ml of vodka.

Each shot of vod is 1.5 oz., so if we're using 1.5 8 oz. of alcohol, then 8/1.5=5. However, if we were using 8 oz. then each shot is.75 oz, so we'd multiply.75 by 5, so we'd use 3.75 oz. of alcool.

Given that smartphone is priced at $300, personal computer at $500, and the total cost of the two products is equal to the price of the tablets, which is given as $800. Thus the sum of costs for all three products is the price of tablets, which is $800.\n\nHence, the required price is the individual cost of the three products plus the sum of the costs of those three products, which is $880.\n\nHope you now know the techniques to answer the questions given above, Happy coding.", "answer": " 2200"}

{"text": "### Demostration:\nInput: How many candles are burned at every birthday party? Choices: 10 1/3, 10+2/10, 15/3, 21/3, 20\nRationales: This question asks for the number of candles that should be on a birthday cake for an adult. The number of candles burned per birthday party can be found by dividing the number of years in the person's lifespan by the number of years that they're one year older. So, for someone that's 15 years old, the number of candles is 45/50 = 4/5 (because the lifespan is 50 years).\n\nSo, for a 55 year old person the number of candles for a birthday party is (55/50) = 3 for a 65 year old person, the number of candle is (65/50) * 2 = 2 for a 75 year old person, it is the same as (65/51) * 2 =2 for a 95 year old person, (75/53)/2 = 2 * 3/5 = 1.2 so we can round up to 2 for a 105 year old person, 2 * 3 = 6 for a 125 year old person, and 3 * 3 = 9 for a 150 year old person.\n\nThe question asked for the candles that should be burned at a birthday party, so the answer should be 2 for someone who is 65 years old.\n\nInput: What does the phrase \u201cI do\u201d mean to most men?

In total, he's paid $235 for the bed frame.\n\n### Rationales: 11. When James decides to buy a bed and a bed frame, the price of the bed frame is given to be $75.  We know that he obtained a discount of 20%.  The logic behind our response is to subtract 20% to the original price of $75 and get $60 for the bed frame.  To find the discounted cost of the bed frame, we deduct 60 from the original cost and we obtain a discount of 10%.\n\n12. Because he obtained a discount, which means that he paid $10 less for the bed frame compared to the base price.  We apply this logic to the bed.  We can say that when he decides to buy a 10x price bed, the original price of it is $25.  Because there's a discount, the price will be further discounted by $2, which means that the total price of the bed is only $23.\n\n13. Based on the information we gathered, the prices of the bed ($23) and the bed frame ($60) are added up to reach $83.  We could have added $83 to the base price of the bed ($25).  But, we chose to use the logic of 10 to come up with a conclusion.\n\n14. The total cost of everything is obtained because we already have the total cost for each of the items in the price list.

What  is the  total  that  Gillian spent at  the farmer\u2019s  markets?\n  Rationales: 1) What are the givens in this math question? \n    In this question, we can see that Sandi had originally $600 and she managed to spend half of it on a farmer's market. \n2) What is the question asking us to solve for? \n    Since the question is asking us to solve for the total that Gillian had spent on the farmer's market, we can eliminate answer choices D and E as they provide the exact total.\n3) Is there more than one solution to this question? \n    Yes. Since Sandi had originally $ 600 and spent half of it on a farm's market, it means that she had $300 after the farmer's trade. From here, we can see that the amount of money Gillian had spent on farmer's markets is directly correlated with the amount of money Sandi had left from the farm's market. We can then consider Gillian's spending from the perspective of the amount of money that Sandi had left. \n4) Rearrange the equations into an equation that can be solved. \n    To re-arrange the equation, Sandi's original money is $ 600 while Gillian's spends $150 more on the farm's market than the one Sandi made. \n   Therefore we can rewrite the equations as follows:\n   $$600-x=150$$\n   $$x+150=2100$$\n   And now we have two equations with two unknown values, so we can now multiply them together. \n   $$150x=2100X=420$$\n 5) What are the knowns and unknowns in our equation? \n    First we can rewrite the knowns as $600 - x = 150$. \n    And our unknowns are $x", "answer": " 1050"}

{"text": "He climbed 55 feet.\n\n### Rationales: \n- The question asks us to identify the total height of the staircases climbed. \n- Climbing a flight of stairs, also known as \"staircase\" refers to progressing up/down a set of staircases in a linear fashion, one after the other. \n- The context provides a number of relevant steps per staircase and number of staircases.\n\n### Logic: \n1. We know John climbed three staircases, we'll call this total number of staircases (S). \n2. For each staircase (S), the step (s) has some constant value (0.5 feet). \n3. For the 1st staircase (S\u2081), the number of steps is (20). \n4. For the 2nd staircase (S\u2082), the number of initial steps is twice that of the first (40), and John climbs that many steps (40) in the 2nd stairs. \n5. For the 3rd (S\u2083) staircase, the initial number of steps is ten less than the initial number of steps of the 2nd stary.\n        (10 less than 40 == 30 less than 45, where 45 is the initial no of steps in S\u2082)\n6. 30 is the number of steps John climbs in the 3rd staircase.\n7. Taking each staircase (which we call staircase i), its number of steps (s\u2081i, s\u2082i, s\u2083i) are as follows and sum up to 140. Thus, S (total number of stairs) = 140 steps.  \n        s\u2081 = 20, s\u2082 = 40, s\u2083 = 30\n8. Hence, S = s\u2081 + s\u2082 + s\u2083 = 140\n9.

{"text": "It is given that Olga has 3 stripes on the sides of each of her tennis shoe, Rick has 2 stripes less than does Olga per shoe, but Hortense has 2 stripes more than does Olga per her shoes.  \n\nSince we are given 3 stripes for Olga's shoes, and 2 stripes less for Rick's shoes, thus the sum is 5 for both Olga and Rick. \n\nHowever, Hortense  has 2 stripes or twice that amount so we need to double the 5 which is 10.  Thus 5 + 10 = the combined total.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We start with the first statement of Olga has 3 on each side.  \n2. Next Rick has 2 less than does Olga on each side.   Thus Rick has 0 + 5 = 5 on each side of his shoes.  \n3.

So we start by analyzing the amount of bananas in one set.\n2. This set has 6 piles of bananas and each pile contains 12 hands (that hold 9 bananas each).\n3. Each hand contains 14 bananas; each of these hands has to be divided by each of the other hands, giving us 14/12 or 1.1666 or 11/10 for each hand.\n4. Adding the amount of bananas of 12 + 11/12 + 13/14 + 15/16 + 17/18 + 19/20 will result in the total of 108/54 or 2.13 or 108/9 = 12. Therefore, in total, this set includes 12 monkeys splitting 108 bananes amongst them.\n5. The other set has 6 pile that contains 12 hands, meaning that each pile has to split 66/6 or 11.66 or 6.66 bananas to each hand.\n6. Therefore, in total there are 12 monkeys and splitting 6.66 + 6.66/11, the amount of bananas will 126/6 or 21.00 or 21/20. Therefore, on the whole, each monkey will get 2/10 of 126 banana.\n7. So we have one set of 12 monkes that share 108 banans equally; and the second set of monkeys that share 126 bananas, resulting in each animal getting 2/10 and 2", "answer": " 99"}

{"text": "Peter bought 2 ounces of sode for a total of $.50.\n\n### Rationale:\nTo solve this task, we must understand the question and the mathematical formula associated with it. \n\nFirst, the question is asking the amount of ounces of sodes we buy when we have a specified amount of money and leave the store with \"x\" number of dollars. \n\nSo, let's look at the available values and their definitions: \n\n1. We are given a certain amount of dollars to buy sode with.\n2. We do not know how much the soda costs per ounce.\n3. We can also define the value of the sodes bought without going into the mathematical details.\n4. The sodes we bought are left with \"x\" number.\n5. The money left in hand after buying the sode is \"x\" number. \n\n### If we plug and play with the formula, we can simplify the above value into the one shown below: \n\nThe formula for the amount of sode we buy is given by `Amount = (Price x ounces) / $2`\n\nSo, let\u2019s plug the numbers for above values into the formula:\n\n1.

The amount of ounces, we bought using the above formula = `0.25 * (2) / 2 = 0.50` (Since the denominator is 2 and we have $2, hence it should be divided by 2).\nSo, in the scenario, he buys 2 ounces for the total of $. 50\nIt is logical to assume that he bought 2 ounes for that amount of money.\nHence, the answer is \"2\" ounces.\n\n### Reference", "answer": " 6"}

The question is about where cows eat, which would be their normal environment and diet. \n2. Let' get an answer by removing the irrelevant options:\na. No, a cow would not eat grass, hay and feed, as those are not a cows' normal habitat or diet.\nb. No, a cow will not eat on the grass as that is where they usually graze.\n3. The options that remain are \"fields and stalls\", \"hay bale\", and \"floor\".\n\"fields and stalls\" could mean that a cow eats grass in that specific area or it could mean in that general direction. They may also be in fields and stalls in caged areas, where they will likely just eat the grass and hay that the farmers lay out for them. Therefore, we can discount this option.\n4. \"Hay bale\" is an unusual option here. Hay Bales are generally only used during the winter, when the grass has been harvested, and cows can then eat their fill without worrying about them getting chomped on by animals or predators. Hence, it is unlikely that a cow would eat in a hay bale and this can be discounted as an option.\n5. Hence, in the end, the cow eats on the \"floor\", as that's the most basic answer.\n6.

Plugging in the values for N and 2, we get:\n  2N = 6 + 3, which reduces to -5 + 2 = -3, which is still 6, the final number.\n6. Hence, we can conclude that the answer is 6.\n7. Since N is the number of practice weeks and 2 is the number of object gains per week on average, the number of objects juggled can be equal to 2^N - 3, where 2 is the average growth per week and N is the number of training weeks.\nInput: If a person was going to see a movie and wanted a soda and a popcorn, why shouldn't they?

If a person buys one movie ticket on each day of the week and pays all of the prices, how much does that person spend?\n\nRationales:\n1. The question is about how much a person would spend on movies. Movies differ in price for each day of the week. On Monday, the price is $13. Similarly Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday cost $17, $17, and $17. Friday is the only day with a price of $50.\n\n\n2. Now we can calculate how much the person ends up spending for buying movies for each day of a week.\n\tThe total cost on Monday= $13*1= $13\n\tThe total cost for buying a movie ticket for Tuesday= $13*2= $26\n\tThe total cost of buying movies on Wednesdays= $26*2= $52\n\tThe total cost to buy a movie on Friday= $50.\n3. By adding and subtracting, we can calculate what we would spend for each day of the weeks as follows:\n\tMonday: Spend $13\n\tTuesday: Spend $52 = $13 + 26\n\tWednesday: Spend $73 = $26 + 26 + 21\n\tFriday:Spend $50\n4.

{"text": "56 minutes\n\n### Rationale:\n### Demonstartion:\n\nInput:\n\n1. 6 miles per hour\n2. Monday, 30 mins, Tuesday, 35 mins, Wednesday, 60 mins, Thursday, 10 mins\n3. 1 hour, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday have different times but same number of hours\n4. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Sunday\n5. Friday\n\nRationales:\n\n1. We multiply 6 mph to the given time of running for each day for the first 3 days and add it up (3 x 35 mph + 165 mph)\n2. We subtract the given time of each day for each day from the previous day's running time which gives us 3:27\n3. We add the running time from Monday 6 am till sunday 6 am which gives us a total time of 39h+39m=7h+15m = 90m\n4. The question asks the how much time we should run on Friday. Since we divide this time by 3 then we should run 30 mins on weekdays. Friday's working time is 1 hour which is 60 mins so we should run for 1hr+30mins = 2hrs+30mins\n5. So the running time should be (3h+30m)/60=5:20\n6. And the total time should be 2hrs+18m\n7. So  the total time of the week should be 7+18+12+11+12 = 52h\n8. 70 mins for 52 h = 1 mph\n9. Since running 20 miles for 6 mins give us (20/6) = 3 3/6 miles and since 4/3 =1.333 and rounding it to 1.33 gives us the answer 3.666 or 3 3/3 = 50%\n\n\n### Input\n\nInput: Who was responsible for the accident at the factory?

{"text": "Input: Bekah had to read 617 pages in all. She read 164 pages in 7 days. How much did she read in each day?\nRationales: The question asks what percentage of Bekah's total readings are represented by each reading day.\n1. The total readings is the sum of all days (617) read.\n2. The reading on day 1 is 113/7 (which implies that Bekah read 164 for 7 days).\n3. The percentage each day represents of Bekah's readings each day is the number of pages read in each day divided by the total readings in each day.\nThe percentage of pages each day represents can be calculated as follows:\nDay 1 =113/617 = 18.29%\nDay 3 =137/617 =22.43%\nDay 4 =119/617 =19.46%\nDay 5 =145/617 =  23.52%\n4. The total percentage of pages read per day can be calculated by multiplying the results of each day by the total of all days. So,\n5. Total per day=18.29*617+22.43*617+19.46*617+ 23.52*617=91.055\n6.

{"text": "The correct answer for this question is A: 7\n\n### Response Explanation:To answer the question, we have to consider all the relevant information. We know that Jack's basket can hold 2 times as many apples as Jill's basket when both baskets are full. \n\nWe also know that, if Jack's basket is currently full, there are 12 apples in it, and he can fit 4 more. Jill's basket will have 2 times as many as her 12 apples (since it is currently empty) with at least 4 apples. Since her basket can hold at least 4 more apples, we can conclude that they have the same number of apples, and that her basket can hold 7 more.\n\nThe reason the answer is 7, is because in order to fit her basket, Jack has to remove one apple from his basket. This means, that every time a Jack removes one apple, Jill gains one. Now, if Jack has to remove one more apple from his basket, he will have the same number of remaining apples in his basket as Jill. Since he will no longer have a difference (since they will have the same number when full), she will gain only one apple.\n\nTo conclude, Jill will gain one apple every time Jack removes one. Since we know that Jack has to remove an apple from his basket to make Jill's basket full.\n\nWe know that Jill will gain an apple after 6 or less (since they know how many apples they each have to begin with). Thus we get:\n`12 + 6 = 18, which is in Jill's basket.`\n\n`12 + (12 - 18) = (12 + 6) - 2 = 6 - 2 \u2248 4, which is in Jack's basket.`\nLet's try it out one last time:\n\n```\n Jack has to remove one, so Jill gains one:\n    Jack has to remove one, and Jill gains one :\n     12 + 6 - 1 - 1 \u2248 4 + 6 - 2 = 4\n```\n\n### Input:\"You are eating a grapefruit.

{"text": "The bill would be $925.\n\n### Response Rationale:To determine the answer to this question, we need to first know how many calls Ayla could manage to take during the course of a week if each one lasts on average one hour. That would be twenty-five calls, or 25. That, plus the five cents charged for each call, would total two dollars and fifty cents (25 x 0.05).\n\nNow we must multiply that number by fifty to arrive at five hundred dollars ($500). However, Ayla\u2019s job involves hearing complaints from her customers, so even if each complaint only lasts one minute on average, she will still get paid five cents for each call.\n\nThat means the total is $925 ($500 x 180/60).\n\n### Input:- The average American male weighs 192 pounds.\n- The heaviest human body to date tops out at 480 pounds.\n- The average maximum lifespan of a human is 115 years.\n\n```\nInput:How many pounds of weight is added per year if the average weight of humans increase every year?\n...\nRationales:2.

First, we'll need to assume the total distance of Bobby's trips to be 2 and the tank capacity to be 12 gallons. We'll label these constants as $d_{total}$ and $c_{tank}$. With this notation, these variables will be able to represent different values.\n\n#### 2. Substituting the variables into the equation given is a step in simplifying the problem.\n\n#### 3. Simplifying and solving the equation gives us 0.5 miles/gal. There could be other values for the variable $d_{total}$ that would give different solutions. This is a consequence of the constraints on fuel consumption and distance covered for each trip. We have to find a solution that lies within an envelope of values (the envelope in this case would be $d_{total}$ between 0-2, and $c_{till} = 12$.\n#### 4. If we take for instance the case $d_{total} = 0$, i.e. a journey of exactly 2 miles to the supermarket and back. The fuel consumed would be $d_{till} c_{tank} = 8$ gallons. The total travel is $2$ miles. This means the vehicle is consuming 4 gallons of gasoline every mile.

Weeding may not require as much water as one of the other options such as cleaning, irrigation, or planting.\nResponse: \nEven though water is used on a farm, it generally plays a distinct role depending on the specific job the farm is undertaking. Farming is an integral part of agriculture where farmers engage in activities such as rearing and harvesting crops.

The day before had 54 people shopping. Nobody shopped in the store on more than two consecutive days. How many people shopped in the store in the three-day period?\nRationales: The total number of people who shopped in the store is four hundred and twenty, or 420.\nThe first step was to count the number of people who shooped. We know that 420 people shopped because 440 (40 + 50 + 54) visited the store.\nThe next step was to take the day with the lowest number of people and the one day after, subtracting 1. Now we know the total numbers of people on these respective days.\nThe lowest number (day with least people) was 180.\nThe second lowest number then was 220.\nTherefore, our total number of people who visited the store is 420. This makes sense because they could not have had an equal amount of people who shopped the first and the second day.\nHope this helps you.", "answer": " 140"}

One way is to look for the location of any water pipes, as these will indicate where the water is being stored or used on the boat.\nAnother way to determine the location of water on a boat is to look for watertight bulkheads, as these may indicate the presence of water. It's also good to know where any water pumps are, which can be used to pump water from one place on the boat to another.\nFinally, it's important to monitor the bilges, as these can indicate a leak in the boat's hull. Taking inventory of these parts will allow you to figure out where water is located on the boat.\n\n### Input2:What color is the water blue?\n\n### Demaostration2:\nInput: The color of water is determined by the amount of the light that is reflected and absorbed by different components in water. Blue light is absorbed more than green or red light, and so water looks blue.\nThe color of water is also affected by the wavelengths of light reflected from different particles in water. When we see water we are mostly looking at smaller particles like organic matter and bacteria.\nWater is also home to different chemical and biological processes that can cause the color to change. For example, if there is a lot of algae in the water, it will absorb more blue light than water that is free of algae.\nCaused by the way, light travels through water, the sky also reflects blue light which is why it appears to be a blue color.\n\n### Examplar:\nInput:In the 1960s, the water is considered to be blue because the algae and bacteria in the water has taken on a green hue.\nThe water also reflects some blue light from the sky, which gives the water the appearance of being blue.\nAnswer:", "answer": " 30"}

On Tuesday he writes for the same time period but at a slower rate of 60-minutes per 5 pages or1 page every 10 minutes. This means that he only writes 1 page total in his journal from Monday-Wednesday.\n\n### Input-Response:\nInput: How could you increase the rate from Monday? Choices: 10 p.m. A: add 1-minute intervals B: add 2-minute intervals C: add 5-minute intervals D: decrease 1-minute interval E: decrease 2-minute interval\nRationales:1. The question asks for the action that would \"increase the rate \" from Monday.\n2. We can see that on Monday, Mack writes one-page per 30-minutes. \n3. To increase the rate, we would have to double the time that Mack spends writing his journals from one-minute to 2-minutes.\n4. To do that, we need to increase the time that Mack works on his journal by an equivalent  amount to the amount of time that he already takes to complete one-page. Thus, to increase the rate of Mack's writing, he would need to double the length of the time that he spends writing.\n5. Let's analyze each option: A can be eliminated because we can't increase the rate by increasing the time spent on Monday. \n6. option B can't be correct because we can't double the time per-minute and keep the overall time unchanged.\n7. Option C can't be correct, as it doesn't involve any change to the time per-minutes and there is no additional time provided to reach a rate of 2-per-minutes.\n8. The only option left with which we can increase the rate is E: decrease the time spent on Monday by one-minute; thus, Mack's writing takes, at most, 1-minute for one-page.

That's why I say just subtract 8 gifts and that gives you the total gifts between the two birthdays, which is the answer.\n3. So we can solve this question pretty simply by just subtracting 8 from each birthday, and then subtracting the 20th one.  That leads us to the answer of 20 because the 20th day was 20 gifts.\n4.

This question does not say anything about what kinds of tumors they might have or where exactly they are located in the brain. \n1. Let's analyze each option one by one:\n   A) Paralyzed is the correct answer. Being paralyzed is a possible result of having a brain tumor. It is caused by damage to the neural system and could lead to difficulty with movement, balance, coordination, and sensation.\n   B) Fever is not true. Having a brain tumor could potentially cause fever, but it's not a guaranteed result. \n   C) Blindness is not true. While some brain tumors can cause vision loss, most typically affect the optic nerve causing blindness. There's no reason to think that a brain tumor would be the probable cause of this blindness. \n   D) Memory loss is not true. Although it can sometimes be a side effect of having a brain tumour, the overall evidence suggests that memory loss is not a result of having a brain lesion or brain tumor.\n   E) No motor control is not true. Motor control is not only affected by physical diseases and injuries like ALS, but also by the brain itself.

Choices: 3B C E 5A C J H L R N K G Q E B E T I O E T I G V V R E V P\nRationales: There could have been at least one correct answer available, because there were at least 5 letters in the given string.\n1. The string of 42 characters in the question consists of exactly 13 consonants and 29 vowels and other letters.\n2. The first 4 consonants in the string are \"B\", \"C\", \"E\", and \"G\"\n3. The letters \"E\", \"T\", and \"V\" constitute a common pattern as well, appearing thrice in the string\n4. Furthermore, the letter \"Z\" does not appear anywhere in the string. This information helps us narrow down our options.\n4. Next, we can eliminate some options based on the information provided.\n    * \"C\" does not appear anywhere, which makes it a possible answer.\n    * \"B\" and \"R\" do not contain any vowels, and they are both the first consonants in the provided string. Therefore, they are both possible answers.\n    * Eight of the letters in the string (\"H\", \"I\", \"J\", \"K\", \"L\", \"O\", \"P\", and \"Q\") either do not have similarities between them or are not first letters.\n5. Finally, we can put all of this information together into a tree of possible answers.\n6. After evaluating the relationships of the letters and their various potential combinations, we can conclude that the answer is either \"C\" or \"R\", as these are the only letters with consonants in the first position and that share the letter combinations \"C\", \"E\" and \"T\". We can eliminate \"G\" and \"Q\", which appear without the use of \"E\", and also \"N\" and \"E\" as they share two different letter combinations. Hence, the answer to this question is \"C\".\nAnswer: C\n\n### Instructions: The following equation represents the fraction of water that froze at different times throughout an ice age.\n(Ice Age)\nt = time \nP = percent\n\n10^3/1", "answer": " 71"}

She is missing one hat to make 5 stripes.\n\nThe total number of hats with either 2 or 3 stripes is 6. Because each of those hats has 1, 2, or 3 stripes, we can subtract the total in each category to find the total number of hats containing 1, 2 or 3 and then add that to her stripe total.\n\nEach hat with fewer than 4 stripes contains 1 stripe, and the total number of huhets with fewer than 4 strokes is 6.\n\nTherefore Vaishali has 17 hats with fewer than 4 streps.\n\nSince each of those hats with 2 or 3 streps, we can subtract the entire 2 or 3, 17 streps and add that into Vaishali's total streps.\n\nSo that gives us 17 stripes + 345 = 362 stripes on Vaishali's 4 hats.\n\nVaishali has a total 362 hats on 4 hats with stripes.\n\nTherefore the total number of strokes is 362 strips on Vaishali' s 4 hats in her collection.", "answer": " 34"}

This statement means we will have calculate how many hours Jack and Jill (friends) rented for.\n\nWe can recall the question asked earlier in the lesson by looking at the options which ask us to identify places where one wouldn't find water. The question asks this: \"Where could you find some plumping that would not be useful when thirsty?\"\n\nWe can also know that if we would not find water in a place, then we surely can't pay that place's prices. The \"price\" of water is essentially the cost of the product itself and cannot be higher. Or can it? Yes. It can be higher if the water is for human consumption (which it is usually, but not always). So the cost also increases, as long as it is not water for your pet!\n\nI will go into more details on how money is given to determine costs on a later lesson. For now, I can only say that the cost of anything is either its price tag or its exchange value.\n\nNow, let us find the cost of the cottage when Jack and Jill both rent it. Remember, Jack and Jill share the cost. That means, Jack does not pay for 1 cottage, but has to pay a share for 1 cottages' cost. So if Jack and Jill share half the total cost of the cottages, the rent will be $5+$4 for each of them.\n\nSo, they both pay $4 since they share the cottage.

From **more than 8,** let's look to the end of the sentence. \n\nThe question is, **How many yards will Brendon be able to cut after the week?** This sentence makes it seem like we need to divide the answer from the previous paragraph (more than eight) by seven (days in a week), which would give us the answer of 1.14 yards per day.

In the previous paragraph, they said that by buying a lawnmower he will be able to \u201ccut more yardage,\u201d so it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s making his cutting more efficient.  \n\nSo we know that his cutting will not be more efficient, even by half, because that would not qualify as cutting **more yardage**.

The cowboy was thinking too much.\n\n### Rationales: 1: The term 'non sequitur' refers to a logical error in which the conclusion does not follow from the premise.\n2: In this line of thought, the cowboy is comparing a woman who apparently has four legs to a ghost he believes to be his old sweetheart, who was human. \n3: This comparison does not make sense, as there is no logical connection between a ghost and a human, and also, ghosts are traditionally believed to be spirits with no physical body. \n4: Hence, we can safely eliminate the answer C as it is not a plausible conclusion from the cowboy's train of thought.\n5: A: In this context, a woman who appears to have four legs could be interpreted as a ghost or supernatural entity, which makes sense in the cowboy's mind, hence we can pick the option A as his thinking seems logical.\n\n### Final Answer: Answer A is the correct answer.\n\n### Discussion:\nSometimes it is important to think about the logic behind a reasoning, especially when the rationale is not immediately apparent and doesn't conform to conventional wisdom. It is also important to analyze the options carefully and determine the most likely or relevant conclusion.

She can meet in the morning, afternoon or evening. However, she can only visit one company per day. How many companies can she meet with in five days, given that each meeting takes up eight hours of time and costs $800?\n\n### Rationale :\nBased on the question, we know that the salesman can take five days to visit five companies. Each visit takes up eight hours and costs $80. These two factors help us form the restriction that the total time she can spend on the visits must add up to less than 40 hours. Therefore, the maximum number of companies she can meet with is five, as suggested in the question. \n \n### Input :A salesperson is trying to sell a piece of luggage to a customer.

{"text": "288 centimeters\n\n### Rationale: \nWe know that every two sides of the triangles are the same size, so to determine the area, all we need is the two sides of the triangle of each person.  \n\nZion's triangle dimensions are 40 centimters * 16 centimeters, which gives us an area of 640 centimeters squared (not correct, it is 64 cm^2)  \n\nHis friend's triangle dimensions are unknown, however we can assume the same shape as Zion's friend and that these friends have two triangles total, giving him an area of 680 centimters squared (not correct yet)  \n\nNow we look at the sum of the area from a single triangle. This is given as 1/2 height * width (in this case, each of a person's 2 triangles are known). So we have 1/2 * 40 * 20 = 100 (not correct yet) \n\nWe know that Zion's triangles had 20 centimters between the height and the width, so we add 100 to it, arriving at 288. Our friend, however, has a height + width difference of 40 centimetres, so adding 20 to 180 gives you 200. Adding 180 to 20 leaves you with 200, then adding 100 makes you 300. Then add 288 to 300 which gives you 588. Then, you just have to subtract 288 from 588 since 288 is the sum of the width * height for Zion and friends.  \n\n### Input:\"If you add a cup of water to a tub full of water, what would the water be called.\"\n\n### Rationales:\"Water.\"\n\n### Demostration: \"The water is 50%.

We need to subtract the number of birds the squirrel eates (4) from the cup that both birds eat (14) to find out how many birds the feeder feeds during the week. We end up with 10 birds, as the answer. \n\n### Rationales:\nThe question relates to finding how many birds the bird feeder in Ivan's yard feeds weekly. We were given information that Ivan replaces every full cup of birdseed with a new one each week (14 cups) and a squirrel keeps taking a half cup of birdseed each week (4 cups). What we know now is that if the bird feeder feeds 14 birds, the squirrel keeps stealing a half-cup of it, so the feeder needs to replace 14 cups plus 12 cups as the squirrel keeps emptying 12 cups each week because of the squirrel's activities. So, Ivan needs to replace 26 cups to feed the 14 birds. Now we know the number of birds the feeder will feed in a week.\n\nThe answer is 14 birds because Ivan's bird feeder holds 14 cups of birdseed (14 birds x 1 cup).

{"text": "It will take 7 hours and 40 minutes total.\n\n### Rational:\nTo find the time it would take him to complete all the items on the list, we start by noting how many minutes each item will take. For the items under *clean the house*, it takes 100 minutes to do 1 item. For the items under \"*take a shower*\", it takes 60 minutes to do 2 items. These are because each item takes the *same* amount of minutes to do. For the items under \"make dinner\", it takes 40 minutes to do 4 items. These are because of different amounts.\n### Then we note that the items *do not repeat*. This means that we count each amount once and only once.\n### Then, we use the *multiplication* of the things Trey has listed and the *total* time it takes for each of them. This is because we multiply *the size* of each number listings by the *individual* time.\nIn this case, there is 7 things on List Clean the house and therefore we have 7*10 = 70. Similarly, *there are 4 things* on List Make dinner and *it takes 40 minutes per item*. Then, we multiply them together using the *multiplication* symbol. *Because there are many different times on each list, they do not *repeated themselves*. The *time* is 40 minutes for each item. So we multiply each item by 40 minutes. Therefore, we have 4*40 = 160. We also have the *total* time. The items on List Clean the House takes 100 (for each item). Then, the *multiplication* result is 4 * 100 = 400, therefore, the total *time* is 710 + 440 = 1150.\n### Similarly, we *count* the Total time. It is because we put a number onto something.

{"text": "Jeff's weekly total run time was 60 minutes.\n\n### rationale:\n1. The question asks for Jeff\u2019s weekly total run mileage, so it\u2019s not about any one particular day but the total time of all his runs.\n2. So we ignore his change on Thursday and only consider what happened on Friday.\n3. The answer is to subtract his run time on Thursday from his run time on Friday, which is 55 minus 65 = minus 10 minutes.\n4. Therefore the total run time is Jeff's run time on Friday (1 minute + 65 minutes + 10 minutes) = 77 minutes + 10( minutes) = 60 minutes.

{"text": "In order to exceed the consumption of added sugar by 250 calories, Mark would need to consume 16.66 bars of candy (with 25 calories each).\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The amount of 25% added calories Mark can have at the end of a day (according to the recommendation) is 133.33 calories. \n2. Adding 1.5 times that amount to the one-day recommended value would result in Mark consuming added sugar amounting to 150.16 calories on a single day. Adding 0.01 more will still cause the total consumption of added sugar to be 150.2 calories.\n3. The question asks for the number of bars of candy Mark could take to cause the total consumption of 150.3 calories, which would mean that Mark should consume 16.3 bars of candy to consume 16 added sugar amounting to a total of 25 calories.\n4. After considering the context from the original question about men consuming no more than 133.4 calories total, we can determine that Mark took a total of 20 bars of candy to cause the total consumption to 150 cal, resulting in the answer of 16.6.\n5.

(The 504.n+300.1 = 1008).\n\nThe first throw was only 6 x 2 x (distance thrown the 2nd throw), so it was 720 meters.\n\nThus, the sum total of the 3 throws is 1054 meters: \n\n720 + (1008-296.6) + 504 = 1054.\n\nLet's subtract the 300.2 to get a more accurate result:\n1054 - 300.3 = 754.7\n\n**Solve the Given Equation**\n\nTo solve the given equation, we need to plug in the knowns into the given equation.

{"text": "The total number of birds remaining at the end is 13.\n\n### Reason:\nAt the start of this question, the number of white birds in the cage would be equal to the total number of grey birds in it, which we can calculate by looking over the information provided and finding that the grey birds comprise 40% of the birds in the bird cage.\n\nBy using the information we have gathered about the birds and the total number of birds in the cage, we can calculate the total number of white birds as well as the total number of grey ones. Thus, we can calculate the percentage of white birds to grey ones.\n\nAdditionally, according to the information provided at the start of this question and the calculations we have done, we know that the number of birds in the bird cages equals 130.\n\nIn order to find the number of grey birds we can subtract the total number of birds left inside the cage after the ten minutes has passed.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the percentage of grey to total birds. From here, we need to multiply that amount by the initial total number of grey birds to get the initial number of white birds.\n\nSubsequently, we need to subtract the total number of white from the initial total number of white birds and then divide this number by 100.\n\nFinally, we can subtract the initial total number of birds from the total number of birds after ten minutes have passed.\nThis will allow us to calculate the total number of remaining birds at the end of the given scenario.\n\n### Explanation:\n### Summary:\n1. Firstly, we look over the given information and calculate the percentage of white to grey birds; the given information we have says that there are a total of 130 birds and that after ten minutes half the birds leave the cage, leaving 40 grey birds and 36 white birds.\n2. Next, we subtract the initial number of grey from the initial total birds and then calculate the percentage of white from grey; this gives a value of 66%.\n3. Now we use the formula given and calculated the number of white birds. Subsequently, we subtract the total number of remaining white birds from 35 (the initial value). Afterwards, we can calculate by dividing this number by 13, thus giving the answer of 13 birds.", "answer": " 66"}

Which one of the choice is not the reason for conviction\n\n1. The man has a bad memory B. Bad memory implies the man could not retain the memory for long time.\n   This does not support the answer choice, that is, conviction is not directly related to whether a man is forgetting a memory.\n2. The man has a good memory C. Good memory is not important because when a man has a good memory, he is actually likely to remember events in his life.\n   This choice does not support the answer either, and, according to the choices, the man's memory impacts how much he remembers and remembers him, which is not a cause for conviction.\n3. They are not forgetting what happened D. Conviction is not related to forgetfulness, it's related to the act of committing the crime.\n\n4. Therefore the correct answer is D.

{"text": "$1200, $2000, or $2800\n\n### Demonsration:\nAnswer: $2000\n\n## Instruction:\nAmy needs 3 times as much water to fill 3 times as many cups as Emily does. If Emily fills 1 more cup than Amy, how much water does Amy need to fill 2 more cups? Choices:   A: half as much B: more half C: twice as much D: more one half E: one third\nRationales:  1. Water is one of those quantities, like apples or oranges, that cannot be broken down into smaller pieces, but only consumed in the whole. In other terms, once an object has a certain quantity of it, it cannot be cut up into smaller units of the same quantity. Because of this, to get half of something, you actually have to add the other half, then get the other half of that, and so on.\n2. If Amy requires three cups to fill three cups, then that means that Amy has one cup worth of water to fill one cup. The next step to take is to apply the multiplication equation, 3x3 = 9. Then, multiplying 15 by 9 and getting 135 shows the number of cups Amy would require.\n3. Let us now apply our formula again. Since Emily fills one cup more than Amy needs, it means that it takes Emily 5 cups to fill up Amy's needs of 4. From this information, it follows that Amy's requirement to complete what Emily finishes is 5 cups x 4 = 20. This means that if Emily fills 72 cups, Amy must have needed 135 cups to complete the task.\n\n## Rationale \nAnswers: A: half as much\n\nC: twice as much\n\nE: one third\n\nAnswer: D: more than half as much.", "answer": " 270"}

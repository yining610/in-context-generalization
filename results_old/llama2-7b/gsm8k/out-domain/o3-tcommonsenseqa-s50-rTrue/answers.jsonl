We know that 9 truck stamps more than snowflake stickers. However, we know she has also 18 more snowflake sticker than rose sticker.\nThus, the number of rose sticker is 5.\nWe can see from number of stamps purchased, the number of rose stamp = 5, the number of snowflakes stickers = 11.\nWe know she has 18 snowflake stamp more than rose stamp.

We know that we can use the following equation to work this question: \u201cthe product of any number with a positive power is a positive number.\u201d \n\nWe also know that if a number is negative and it meets the equation above, then the value of the number will be a negative number if both other numbers are positive. For example, if we multiplied by 7, -3 and 2, the product is positive if the others factors are equal or greater than zero. Therefore, the answer of this equation will be negative. \n\nWe also notice that in the question, we also have to consider that the signs of the numbers are important. Even though the second number (y) is negative, the product still is positive if the denominator and the first element is positive.\n\nTherefore, we just need to convert the second", "answer": " 38"}

First, we must understand the context of this problem. It asks about an effective method of teaching in a classroom situation. \n2. One good strategy we can try is to give students something to write on when they're expected to be listening and not talking.\n3. This could be like a textbook or a notebook, and if the students are engaged in taking notes on what the teacher is saying, they should be less likely to disrupt the class.\n4. We can also try to find out who the disruptive students are and talk to them privately. Some of them may be experiencing personal issues or challenges and need more guidance.\n5. We can reward the students who follow the rules with positive reinforcement, like verbal praise or a small reward, and provide a positive example with the teacher talking in an attentive and engaged manner.\n6. We should keep reminding students of the importance of listening, and be prepared to take action to enforce the rule for students who continue to talk in class.\n7. We can encourage students to ask questions and participate in class discussions, as long as they are doing so in an appropriate manner.\n8.

First of all, we note that we can calculate Sansa's income using the substitution property, which is $5(5x3x5) = $600 (note: 'x' in here represents 'x multiplied by a number').\n2. Then, we check for an empty slot because the last slot doesn't have any numbers in it: 600 + ____ = 600. A number that can fill an empty slot cannot be equal to an unknown number that precedes it. Therefore, the answer to this equation (600 + ___ = 600) is ___. Since there are no more empty slots to examine, we can conclude that ___ represents an unknown number.\n3. Finally, we calculate the unknown number by substituting, that is: 600 (6) = $3600 (note that the number 6 can represent any even number).

{"text": "Choices: A: 8 pages B: 7 pages C: 6 pages D: 6 pages E: 5 pages\n\n#### Rationales:\n1. The question asks the number of pages per one book, which means that each book has the same amount of pages: 80. To answer this, we can divide the entire number of pages by the number of books, which gives us 6. If each book includes 12 inches, it means that each book contains 2 inches thickness on average. Adding up 2, 4 and 6, we get 12. Therefore, the number of pages per book is 12/6 (with remainder 2). Therefore, each book has 7 pages.\n\n### Input : A bookmark has 20 pages.

But this statement is unreliably ambiguous because it could mean that Sheila told Randy about the 10000 hour rule generally or about Randy himself passing the 100 000 minute mark. This ambiguity should be resolved by understanding that the rule states that for a skill to be considered an expert in their field after at least 1000 hours of practicing and therefore would apply to individuals who have reached this practice.\n\nInput: After 10 0 hours of practice, Randy wants to be an expert and in his field.

The lowest score is 0 because the exam is divided into three parts. 90% if the 40 is added to 25, and, the 60 is added to 75, leaves only 5 (because they are subtracting parts that weren't there originally). So that's why 0.\n2. The student scored a 125. Each question was weighted so the exam had a total value of 125 (because each part is worth 100, and there are three parts). 125 divided by three is 40, which means the student scored 40 for each part.\n3. If the student scored 300 divided by 3, that totals 100.

{"text": "40 tires are on the cars and motocycles on the lot.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nWe can start by looking at some facts and the question\n1. We know that there are 24 cars and motocycles in total.\n2. In addition, a third of vehicles are motocycles.\n3. And a quarter of the cars come with a spare tire included\nNow lets break it down\nTo work out the number of cars, I'd first subtract the number of motorcycles. The number of total vehicles is 24 and the number of motorcycle is 8. The remaining vehicles must then be cars. In cars the number of spare tires are 8(quarter). There are also 8 motorcycles so that's 18 cars without spare tires.\nThe number of cars without spare tires times the number of motorcyes with spare tires is 18 x 8. This is equal to 144.\nNext, we subtract the number of motorcycle plus the number of cars without spare because motorcycles come with a spare tires already. If we add together the number of spare tire in motorcycles and in cars but exclude the number of spare tiers and cars we get the number of cars WITH spare tires. 24-8-8=6.", "answer": " 84"}

In the first equation, 'x+65000'we can substitute the term'market value'we obtain' x+6500'this shows that the man paid an extra amount of $6500 over the market price.\n 2. The second equation shows that the man paid less than his market price. The symbol 'x-65' indicates that he has paid an amount of $65 less than the market price.\n  3. The third equation has a symbol '-65' which represents an amount of $-65. This means that the man paid an amount of $-60 over his market price.\n  4. The last equation contains '$65000' that represents the excess amount the man paid. Therefore, option A is correct.\n```\n\n### Conclusion:The answer in context is the price which is lower than the market price and subtracting the seller\u2019s profit margin for the property purchase this equation can be written as x-65,  which is the answer 'x-65000'.\n\n### Answer: The man paid $65,050 below the", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "Apples = number of apples purchased (Cecile + Diane)\nSo apples = 35\n\n### Inputs:The number of apples that Alice and Beatrice bought. Choices: A: 15 B: 17 C: 20 D: 28 E: 10\nRationales:\n\n1. We need to clarify the wording of the question. The statement reads \"The number of apples...\" which indicates that the initial sum is known (15 or 17 or 20 or 28 or 10). There is no indication of how many apples they bought (as if they were apples themselves it would suggest they were buying them for eating or to keep).\n2. Both sides of the equation, Alice and Beatrice, are unknown variables.\n\n3. Thus we know we have a number (15) from the number of apples that we can't include in the initial statement (which has an unknown quantity that needs to be solved for), as we do not know how many Alice and Beatrice bought (which is a different unknown quantity from the initial statement which only had one quantity).\n\n4. To proceed and get a workable equation, we will need to know how many apples Alice and Beatrice purchased.\n\n5. We could first eliminate choice C: 20 as Alice and Beatrice did not buy 20 apples together.\n\n6. Hence, we could eliminate choice A: 15, choice B: 17 and choice E: 10 as Alice and Beatre both didn't buy ten apples.\n\n7. Hence, we could solve for the amount of apples both Alice and Beatrice bought together by subtracting 10 (choice E): 10 - 15 = -5 apples.\n\n8. Therefore, their quantity is A. -15 + B. -10 = 10.\n9. As the choice was B and not A, -15 + -17 = 2 apples.\n10. Thus, the total number of apples that both Alice and Beatrice purchased was 22 (2 = B, A -15 + B -10 = C,20).\n\n### Response : 15 - 10 = 5 apples", "answer": " 50"}

If we knew about holidays, we may then also exclude the exceptions when there are holidays.\n3. John can be called on Friday afternoon if it is a holiday since he may have planned to travel or be sick.\n4. Excluding holidays, we can not call him on Wednesday because Tuesday would be the 5pm checkpoint for 5 days and calling would be the 6pm checkpoint for 6 days, so the 6th day would not be between 8am and the checkpoint for Tuesday.\n5.

{"text": "### If seven more rabbits are to be added to the thirte, the rabbit population in the cage will decrease to 1/3 the population of rabbits Jaspers saw in his trip to the park today. This can be solved first by simplifying the number of rabbits the cage started with to 10 and taking the remainder. Then the addition of seven rabbits, as a remainder in a division where the result is more than seven, would simply be added to the remainder. Now, there are thirteen rabbits in a cage. The division would return 1. This means there are 10 rabbits in a cages, and 7 others would be added. \nNow, by simply dividing 13 by 10, the quotient of the quotient of 4 is 3. This means that seven rabbits make up 1/3 of the rabbit population.

Choices:  C: red ones D: green ones E: yellow ones F: blue ones G: purple ones\nRationales: The first thing we notice is that the given crayon colours are written in a seemingly random order. This indicates that none of them should be the correct answer. Next, taking each colour in turn, we see that all of them do share certain similarities. For example, both purple ones and red ones can be written in a different order to stay the same colour. Likewise, both green ones and blue ones are written in a different order and remain the same colour. The only colour which seems more unique is yellow ones, but this also can be written in order and remain the same.

Choices:  A = 84 square yards B = 72 square yards C = 64 square yards D = 56 square yards E = 48 square yards \nRationales:\n1. Our first step to solving this equation is to examine the equation given in the prompt. \nWe should see if there's a method we can use to simplify the question. The first thing to do is multiply both sides of the equation by the dimension of the rectangle's height, D. \nThis will turn y into feet. In y = 6, we notice there is another choice, D = 56, that is much easier to multiply by 6 to get 336. \n2. From here, we need to add 336 to 56 to get 402. \n3. If we now subtract that from 56, we get 102, so we should multiply it by 6 just like we did before. \n4. However, 102 is close to 100, so we should round 102 to get an answer of 100. \n5.

Choices:\nA: That is John at school. B: he is at football practice.\nC: He is looking in the closet for his favorite jacket. D: He is going to his friend's birthday. E: He is getting ready for school.\nRationales: First, we need to determine the subject of the picture. The person in the picture is looking in a closet and wearing a jacket.\nFrom this, we can infer that he goes to school. Furthermore, it can be guessed he is at football practice based on the location of the closet. It is more likely then that he is not going to a birthday party or ready for school.\n\nSecond, we must determine the verb of the sentence. He is looking in the window for his favorite jacket implies that he wants to look something up, specifically his favorite jacket. It is unlikely that he is getting ready for school since he would not be wearing the jacket while getting ready. Hence, the correct pronunciation is choice B: \"He is at football practice\".\n\n### Input\nHappy Easter\n\n### Answer\nHappy Easter to you too.\n\n##", "answer": " 28"}

Choices:  A : USA B : India C : Canada D : Italy E : Australia\nRationales:\n1. First, let's consider the choice we can determine based on the question alone. As it asks specifically about countries, we can disregard all the other options.\n2. Based on that, we can eliminate choices B and E as they are not countries and D as it doesn't specify the continent it's on; Australia isn't necessarily on the largest continent.\n3. Therefore, we have to choose between A (The USA), C (Canada), and A (India).\n4. To determine which is the longest, we need to consider the continent of each country.\n5. The United States (USA) is the 4th largest country, covering 8% of the Earth's total land area and only 2.5% of the Earth' s total area. By comparison, Canada is the 2nd largest country, covering 20% of the Earth' total land area and 4.5% of all land area on Earth. India, our final choice, is the 7th largest country and covers 4.4% of all land area.  However, it's on the 3rd largest continent, Asia, so it is quite a bit larger than the US and Canada. It's also significantly larger than the other choices offered.\n6. Therefore, the largest country is India.\nAnswer: A : India\n\n### Input The 50-pound cat is as tall as the 80-pound dog.

This statement is critical information to consider when answering this question. The total amount of cards available per person is 2,100; Mark, Michael and Lloyd can each collect a different number of cards, as long as the total equals 1,301.\n\n#### Proposed Solution:\n\nThis problem is a classic card-game problem. All three individuals must collect four cards. If each individual collected two extra cards, the total would be three-tenths of a card short of the requirement.

{"text": "An additional two buildings collapsed, for a total of eight collapsing buildings.\n### Rationale: When one collapsing building caused another, the first one was still counted. When counting the fourth collapsing building, the other buildings from the first collapse did not also collapse. Therefore, the first and the third collapses combined and the first and second collapses combined. So the first and second collapsed twice each, totaling four. Three more collapsed including the first one, so the first and fourth collapses each collapsed once more.

{"text": "$9,600\n\n#### Explaination:\n* 400 lb cow\n* gain of 1.5 pounds\n* new weight is 600 pounds\n* price per pound is 3 dollars = $3/lb\n* 600 lb cow sold for $1800.\n\n### Comments:\nThe idea of this question is to find out how much a value of a cow increased. To find that out, we need to find new cow's weight and then multiply it by price to see total price of said cow.\nNew cow's weight is equal to its starting weight multiplied by its change in weight.\nStarting weight is 400 lb (from the question).\nChange in weight is 1.5 time its starting weight but that isn't in the question.\nHow can we find out that change in weight? From the previous question, we know that cow increased its weight by 1.5 pounds. \nTherefore, new cow's weight is 601.5 lb (from formula: starting weight * change in weight equal to 386.75 lb multiplied by 1.5).\nWe have new cow's weight (601.5) and its price (1800 dollars).\nNow all we need to do is multiply new cow's weight by its price to reach our final answer.\n\n### Input\n\nFive chicken farmers purchased and raised 336 chicks.

{"text": "Answers the following grade math question with explanations:Paul went on a shopping spree to his nearest shop. He bought bread for $2, got butter for $3 and juice for twice the price of bread. He still had $15 at end of shopping. How much did Paul have left after shopping? ______\n\n### Rationales: \n1. To understand what's expected, we can look over the question details. The question is, what did Paul spend on bread, butter and juice? In a series, it's important to look at what came first, what came second, how much Paul spent on bread, what he spent on butter and what he spent on juice.\n2. The question can also be broken into \"How much did Paul spend on groceries?\" and then examining groceries in context: what's in his basket?\n3. Looking over each group, we can determine that bread was $2, butter was $3 and juice was twice the cost of the bread. As the total amount of groceries cost was $6 and his total budget was $15, he had $9 leftover.\n3. In the problem above, we can see that it's possible to get an answer in many different ways, as long as all the information is considered. However, in math questions, the answer _must_ be a whole number, nothing like 0.023 or 24.2. \n 4. When the total amount is known, the answer can be determined by first subtracting the total amount of grocery shopping from the total amount that Paul had, _then_ subtracting any remainder with another number. This can be done using addition in several different ways.\n5. For example:\n|\n\n```\nPaul total budget = 15\ntotal cost of shopping = 6\nTotal budget - Total cost of shopping leaves 9\n9 - 6 = 3 \n```\n6. If we're unsure of our answer, we can consider using multiplication! By multiplying both sides by the number 2 to get (9 * 2) = 18, then adding it to our total amount we can get:\n|\n\n|\n\n```python\nPaul total budget = $15 \nTotal shopping cost = $", "answer": " 6"}

The first step to solve it is to find the number of pages of the book so that we can identify the total number of chapters in the book. Given that she had already read chapters 1-10, and she read just two chapters afterward, we can assume 11 chapters are in the book.\n2. The next step is to find the total number of pages Mitchell has read so far.\nAs she read ten chapters of the book from the start and stopped reading at 4 o'clock when the clock was reading 4(or as he had 20 pages written on the eleventh chapter in the clock at 4 o' clock, hence 4 o'clock she had only read 20 pages) we can add 40 pages (10 * 40).\n3.

{"text": "A: $338.00\n\n### Rationale:The new movie is 60% the length of the previous movie, so it has to be 20% of the previous movie. The previous movie cost $5 per minute to film and the new movie costs twice as much. Multiplying the cost of the previous movie by 2/2 gives us 4. Multiplying then the result by the length of the previous film gives us 24. We divide the cost of a film by the time it takes to film it to get the cost per minute. 60% of the previous film is 24 and $50 per minute. 6. $6000 is the total film cost of the new movie. 3 is 50% of this and 20% of this is 1.20, which is $1,666.66.\n\n### Input :If Janet filmed her new movie for 2 hours, what was her total filming cost?\n### Response:B: $119,800.00\n### Rationale :Multiply 3 with 2 gives 6. 6 is 40% of 15, so 8 is 33% of 15. Dividing 8 by 3, we get 2.8, which is a third of 15. 50% of 10 is 5 and 10% of 125 is 12.5. Multiply the three and we get 27.5, which is half of the cost of Janet's new movie.\n\n### A second explanation:Since the cost to film her new movie is $1640, divide by 60, which gives us a cost for filming of $28.33. 50% greater than $28.32 is $45.79 (12,852/465 rounded to the nearest cent). 10% less than $46.93 is $41.44 (7,682*10/100 rounded to the nearest cent. $119, 800 is three times what Janet's new film cost, including filming and editing (3", "answer": " 1920"}

{"text": "There were 72 stickers before he gave them away. In total he gave away 13 stickers. He gave more than Mandy and Justin than to others. From this, we can conclude that he gave 4 more stickers to only Mandy.  This leaves only 59 stickers with him.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n### Input\nColton had 70 stickers. He gave each of them to his 3 closest friends. He also gave each of the last stickers to Mandy and Justin. Mandy was given twice the number of stickers given to Justin. Justin was given less stickers than Mandy. How many stickers did Colton give away? Colton gave away 80 stickers.\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer:\nGiven the scenario, we need to solve to answer the question. We can look at the numbers and what is asked to solve to find the answer.\n\nColton had 59 stickers before he gave any away. After he gave away 16 stickers. We know this because he only gave 3 stickers to each friend. This means he gave away 14 stickers in total.\n\nHis total was 4 stickers fewer than Mandy's. He gave away the 4 stickers fewer less to Mandy then any other friend. This means that he gave away 9 stickers to Mandy.\n\nHis friend Justin only got 8 stickers. We know he got 10 less than his friends and Mandy got twice the amount of stickers Justin got.\n\nColton started off with 59 stickers. So that leaves us at 59-9-8. 59-9 = 42. So 59-8 is 41. Adding the -8 back in to get 49.\n\nAnswer: 49 stickers\n\n\n### Rationales\n\nIn this problem we start with 59 Stickers. \n\nWe need to know how many stickers he gave away. To do this, we need to know three things: \n\n1. The total number of stickers in the end\n2. The total number of people to whom he gave stickers\n3.

{"text": "Two dollars\n\n### Detail1:\nIn this problem, Andy and Bob are going to the canteen to eat together. After that they spent the same amount while Andy bought a can of pop for $1 and Bob bought a can of fruit drink for $1. They all eat together and each person eats two sandwiches and the each sandwich costs $3. Then they come up to the cashier, and Bob's fruit drink costs two dollars.\n\n### Detils2:\nOne thing we need to do in this problem is to find which Andy\u2019s sandwich costs are. There are three choices. One sandwich is only $2, another one is $2,and the third is $4. Andy bought two of them for two dollars. From this information, we know that one sandwich is $2. Also we can know that two are only $4, and the other one is $3.\nLast we have to know how much is $1,2 and $3. From the previous problem, we have that Andy paid $1 for his pops and Bob paid $1 for his fruit drink(we do not have any additional information about them). Then we know that $1+1=2 so we have to $1,2,and $3.\n\nThe next question we must ask is which one costs two dollars? We can eliminate the first choice (33)because the sandwiches\u2019s money was set by Andy and Bob(the first number). That means we can exclude it. We also know that $4+1+1=2,so we can eliminate the second choice(34). Then we can only include the last choice (23)because it is the only one contains $1, $2 and $3.\n\n### Response Detail3:\nAnother way to do this question is using trial and error.I chose two sandwiches for Andy to start. Andy bought a can for $1 and Bob, who bought his can for $2 and the total price of his lunch equals to $4.The question asks for the number, so I am going to search for something with 4, then I want to use trial and error method.

We're also given that Bush will be 13 in 4 years, hence when he turns 13.\n3. The trick is to subtract the set number of years, which is Bush's age (3), from the future year (7).

He started To save $2 In January, followed by $4 In February and 8 In March. If he Continues this Saving pattern, How much will be his Total Savings after 6 Months? \n\nRationales: The input includes Robi's New Years Resolution: to start saving. But it doesn't say how much he wants to start with. Therefore, it's best to keep the assumptions as minimum as possible:\n1. We assume that the only possible change in a pattern is the beginning value of $n.\n2. We analyze various choices and their respective impacts on the total savings if Robi continues the saving pattern:\n3. Choice A: $2 means that Robi decides to save lesser than what he planned initially. This means that his total savings of $6 is now inaccurate.\n4. Choice B: $4 does not have much logical impact on the total savings as it is closer to the initial savings pattern.\n5. Likewise, Choice C: $8 means that Robi will have more money in the last month than at the beginning but it may not be $6 as he expected.\n6. And Choice D: $12 means that Robi's savings are less than usual in the first two months but is more in the end than what he initially planned. Therefore, the total savings is now $6.\n7. Comparing all these conditions, we find:\n8. Choice E: $16 is the only possible condition that fits perfectly with the pattern and meets the condition of \"total savings after 6 Month\".\n9.

{"text": "This is a simple application of the Pigeonhole Principle. If N, the cardinal of any set, is divisible by 6, then a total of 30 minks will be enough to make 15 coats, and that is the case in this circumstance. The minks are divided into two sets, \"the ones made into coats\" and \"the ones set free\", such that, 15/6  (15 \u00f7 6) = 2. The first step to solve this problem is to determine the number of coats made from each set of minks. Andy can make 15 coate from the 15 minks made into coats, so the number of mink left to set free is 30-15=15, so the total amount of minks made into coate is the total amount of coats minus the minks set free, 15-15=0, by applying PGP the amount of coats is equal to the amount of minks. Using the PGP, 30 6 (30 \u00f7 6)  = 5. Let us say the second half of the minks are 15.

We start by examining the first variable, A. This variable can be represented by an integer expression of a base 10 unit, such as 990.563. This number contains the number 990, which is equal to 56 times three units in a unit of 100. The expression 990 is a multi-unit number where each unit is 10. Therefore, 290 is 140.563 times three.\n\n6. To see this numerically, we can substitute the terms in the expression, as follows:\n7. Finally, we can conclude that 290 is one unit more than 281, so the correct answer is option 2.\n### B: varina = 10\n\n### Ratheres:\n1. Variable B is an integer expression of a unit of 1. Therefore, each unit is one. \n2. The expression of variable B contains only 8 units because each unit is one.\n3. The expression of variable A contains 9 units because each unit is 1. \n4. Therefore, the expression is one unit greater than that of variable B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n### The answer is B: varia = 10.", "answer": " 1100"}

{"text": "Tony went to school for a total of 12 years to become an astronaut.\n\n### Justification:\n\nA simple arithmetic shows that tony went to school for four years for one degree, another four years for another degree and two years for a graduate degree in his field of study. If the first four years for his first degree are labeled as D1, the next four are labeled as D2 and the last two as D3 then his schooling is :\n- D1\n- D2\n- D3 (for 2 years in physics)\n- D1 (for 2 years)\n - D3 (for 4 years)\n - D2 (for 4 more years)\n - D1 (for 4 more more years).\n\nHence Tony went to school for a  total of 12 year\u2019s.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1) We first need to look at the task as a whole to determine whether it is a problem solving or math problem.\n\n2) The task contains the phrase \"astronaut\" which gives away that this is a problem-solving problem.\n\n3) The task is then asking the number of years Tony needs to go to school in order to be an astronaut and asks for 12 years as the answer. This is a simple arithmetic problem, so we need to calculate the sum the total number of years Tony went to school.\n\n4) The calculation has not been completely explained. We first need to separate the four years for his first major, tony\u2019s four years for his second major, and the two years for his graduate major.\n\n    We know that the total number of years in all fields Tony went to school is 14 years.  This could be written as a mathematical sequence that looks like - 4, 2, 2 and 8.\n\n5) Next add up 4 with 2 and another 4 with 2. This will give us  10, so that we can subtract 10 from 14 and get 4.\n\n    Once we know that Tony went to school for 4 years for his first degree in his field of studies, we can write this out as 4.\n\n6) Next we need to determine the years Tony went to school for his second major.\n\n    Tony went to school for two", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "### Demostration:\nThe question clearly states that Kat was in the gym 4 times per week for 1.25 hours each week to get her boxing technique. We need to use the equation 24hrs/7 days=3.6, which converts the number of hours a week into time periods. We can now convert 1 hour in the strength training gym into minutes. This is 60mins/1hr=60. We can convert 1.25hours into the same way we converted the first hour into seconds. This is 1.25hrs=75mins. Now multiplying 3 by 3.6 it gives us 10.8. This can also be written as 10.8hrs. So according to the question, we can answer this by saying 10.8/3.6=3 hours per week of boxing training for Kat\n\n### Answer\n\n### Input- \nKat decides she want's to start a boxing cation.  She gets a a membership to a gym and spends one hour a in the gym  three times a week on strenght training.  She also  attended the boxing 8.5 hours a week for 1  a half hour each time \n### Demostation-\nThe equation to write how many hours are converted in a week is 24 hours divided by 7 days. This turns out to be 3.6. This helps us convert our hours into times. Kat is in the strength training gm for an hour. This is 6o minutes a day. A half hour equals 30mins. This is equivalent to a half hour multiplied by 2.0 hours. The results is 60 minutes a day.  We multiply 3 by 3 hours. The results equals 10.8 hours. Now, we can convert this into minutes. Kat spent 24hrs for 1 hour a time. This is equivalent to 24 hours in 60mnt a day and 0.3 in thirty. The results is 10.8mins a day. This brings us to our answer. 10.80/3.60=3.125 hours per week.

They ship on average 7,486 packages in a day. Their shipping time is 49 hours on average for non-urgent deliveries. On average, 20% of their deliveries are rush orders, which require delivering within 8 hours. When 20% or less of their deliveries are delayed and all other packages are delivered within 49 hours, the company spends an average of $57,000 per day. The company wants to maximize their profits by delivering as many rush orders as possible on that same day.\n\n### Response\n\nSince maximizing profit is the goal, the company should focus its energy on the most likely option to increase their bottom line. The least likely scenario, which offers the least profit, has the fewest rush orders, but a lot of other deliveries. This means the companies focus should be on the option which has a moderate number of rush orders and a good chance of catching them within 8 hours. The rush order probability of catching the package within 8 hours is 0.45 (45%) and the company ships 11 packages a hour, which allows an extra hour of shipping time per package. The moderate number of rude orders allows the company to add a little extra shipping time to each package. The maximum profit per day is $38,275.\n\n### How", "answer": " 36"}

We can immediately discard choices IA and ID. Choice IB is ruled out as well because the two fractions cannot be simplified to a common denominator.\n3. We note that both choices II C. and II E. are equivalent fractions. We cannot discard III because only a fraction can be both a numeral or an equivalent fraction (1/3 in this case).\n4.

Choices: \u274c A: fall \u274c B: summer \u274c C: Winter \u2705 D: spring\n\nRationales:\n1. The two main seasons that last all year are summer and winter; summer and winter both have 6 months. Spring is the shortest season. Spring will therefore last 3 months.\n2. Spring is between winter and summer, so it takes the least amount of time, or least amount of trips if traveling regularly, to reach the southern pole since you are traveling at an equal rate during the entire season.\n3. The four mentioned are all seasons that occur during the year, and they all last for six months (3 months for spring, 6 months for summer). It takes longer to travel in the summer.\n4. According to the provided details, it is impossible to travel to the South pole during seasons that contain months longer than May.

Because he has half the number of the other two shoes in the equation, his total (the sum of all three values) is -5.\nB: 10 Shoes Possessed by Edward as the given value Jacob has the half of number of shoes so we need to subtract 5 from the number of shoes possessed by Edward.

{"text": "Lilith was able to sell five dozen water bottles at $1.85 each, totaling $97.50. However, she did not sell five dozen bottles - she only sold 12 water bottles at the regular price, at which point she realized that she could not sell them at the regular price of $2.00. Therefore, she reduced the price to $1.00/bottle and she could only sell the remaining 40 bottles at $1 each, leaving her with $40.00.  Total profit: $57.50.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question asks for the total amount of money needed to buy her friends birthday gift after sells water bottles at lowered rate. \n2. The key here is that she's already spent her original $97.56. \n3. Lilith was able to sell 5 dozen water bottles at 1.85/bottle but the reduced price was 1.0/bottle. \n4. So, Lilith sold 24 bottles at the increased price, making $43. This would have been half of what she needed but her price was already reduced by that much.\n5. Therefore, 40 bottles were left, that she continued to sell at the reduced rate, so 40x $1.00 = $40.0\n6. So, the total she will have left is $97.5+43.00 = 140.50. \n\n### Summary:In this question, the key is to be aware of the amount in the original basket, as well as that the original price has already been reduced.  Furthermore, it is important to recognize that the price being reduced (1.85 -> 1.0) means that the original number of bottles Lilith could sell is reduced as well.", "answer": " 9"}

Velma's, as stated, is 2000 away, and Freddies can be seen from 3 times as far as Veronicas.\nUsing the information given in the question, we can conclude that Freddies is seen roughly 3000 feet away.\n\nWe now use the second constraint to understand how the flashlights are compared for distance.\nAs a constraint, `Freddie's` distance is multiplied 4 times, increasing the original distance from 3 to 12 times Veronica's original distance. \n\nSince Velma's flashed needs to be `2000-x` away from Veronica's, we can deduce that `x=6000`.\n\nThen, substituting that value of `x` into the second constraint, we find that Velma's flash is 200 less than that of Freddie's. The final equation is `0.3 -.2x = 600`. Solving this we find `x = 2000`, and since `x = y` from the first constraint, we know that Velma's is 200 feet away.

They sent the offending player and both teams decided to have five shots for each goal, then the penalty resulted into three points. When did it happen?\n### Demonstion\nTo answer the question, we begin by examining the details, then analyzing each choice to determine a logical answer. We are told that the foul and penalty result in 5 shots, each of which must make 1 goal to score, hence 3 points awarded. We know from context that they take place in the first quarter and that only this is the case at the time of the foul. That the game is scored in quarters, that the game is four quarters long and the time taken to score the penalty must then determine the time they are taken. From the context, we see that this was after the 15th minute. So we now have the only three options that can apply to the time of the fence and penalty.\n\n### A: 2nd quarter\n### B: 1st quarter\n### C: 4th quarter\n\nWe therefore need to establish when each quarter takes place and in what order. The game is played in 4 quarters each 15 minutes in duration, totaling 60 minutes. This means that by the 15th minutes we will have played 9 quarters and it is therefore in the 3rd quarter of the game that the shot is taken\n\n### We then have to consider the duration of each shot if taken at the given time and make use of the three choices.\n### Choice A, which was after the 1st quarter but before the 2nd quarter, can be disregarded\n### Choice C can also be disregarded as it was before or after the end of the game which was in the 4th quarter.\n### The amount of time they have left is therefore 126", "answer": " 10"}

First, we convert the equation to standard form. x2+122=7+77\n2. Next, we solve for the unknown x by isolating it and dividing both sides by the coefficient we found. \n3. Then, divide both sides by the coefficient to solve for x.\n4. Now, we have a final x=70 (rounded to the nearest whole number).\n5. The final step is to compute x2+120.\n6. The answer is 370.\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Instuctions:Solve for x. You will get x on both sides, so flip the equation\n\n### Rationales:\nWe take the answer from the example below:  (x-125)/2  =  x\n1. The first step is to flip the equation on the left-hand side to solve for x. We flip (x-124) = 2x\n2. Since the coefficient is one, the two sides will balance.\n3. We substitute x on the right side.\n4. This is (x) 2 = 2x\n5. Then we subtract 2x from both sides.\n6.

We can tell this from the fact that he plans to collect 50 cans on the first day of the week, but 50 cans more (3 times) on the second day. As we can see, James collected an equal number of cans on each day in that example, but if that happens in the second week as well, he could collect the 50 cans (since it is the first day again) or 50 cans less (the number of cans he didn't collect on the second and third day). Since we can conclude that he collects the same number of cans on the other days of that week, he must have collected the same number in all other weeks except the first two.\nFurthermore, we know that in the second week he could have collected either 50 cans or 50 can less compared to the first week. In the third week, he must collect at least the number he didn't collect in the second week (3x50). But then again, he could have collected less.\nSince we have already excluded the weeks 1-2.5, we can conclude by elimination that all other weeks consist of collecting 50, 3x50, and 75 \u2264 50 cans.\nTherefore, the number of cans that he collected each day was 50, 150, 50, 75, 150 and 100 cans for week 1-6.\n\n\n\n### Input\nChoices:A: 10 B: 8 22 C: 15 20 D:17 23 E: 21 28\nRationales:1.

{"text": "Margaux owns a money-lending company, where she charges customers $5 per day. Her friend pays her 5 dollars per day, her brother pays her 8 dollars a day, and her cousin pays her 4 dollars a day. That is a total of $26 per day, or $403.5 per week. This number is further simplified if rounded down to an even-more-convenient $20 per day, which is a total of $140 per week, which is a total weekly salary of 140.  \n\n### Rationale:\n1. After reading the instruction, we first need to identify what Margaux is. Margaux is the owner of a money-lending business.\n2. Next, we need to note that she charges $5 per day for three different people in her business. After noting this, we can determine that her three different customers are 1. friends, 2. brother and 3. cousin.\n3. When we are asked in the question about the money that she will collect after seven days, we need to find the total. We can do so by summing up the amounts that each customer pays each day.\n4. We do this by taking for example Margaux's cousin, whose total amount for the seven days is $7. Once we have the sum from seven days for Margaux's cousin.\n5. Then, we simply write the total amount that Margaux collects in a week.\n6. After writing the total amount that Margoux collects, we now need to determine if we should round down or round up. We can round up or down since we rounded down in the beginning before the summed amount from seven days. To do this we just write the round down answer at the end of the question after writing down the amount that Margaux collect.\n7.

They used an accurate container, the exact amount of gasoline used from the tanker, and the number of gallons in a tanker. The tanker held 800 gallons of fuel. The container had a capacity of 400 gallons.\nWhile filling the container, the truck drove in such a way that the tanker would keep driving without the person knowing when they had filled the container. They would not want to overfill the container, because it would be too heavy for the truck to carry.

{"text": "Input: Mark has five types of flowers. The garden has 30 yellow flowers, 16 purple flowers, and 25 green flowers. Since there are 80 percent more purple flowers than yellow flowers, we can conclude there are 40 more purple flowers than there are yellow flowers. We can make this into a multiplication problem: 30 x 0.8 = 24. Therefore, the ratio of purple flowers to yellow flowers is 40:24. But how do we get the ratio of 40:25 for green flowers? Using the same equation once again we get 30 x 1 = 30. Therefore the ratio of purple to green flowers is 40 to 30: 40 to 25. Using this we know there are two more purple flowers in the garden than green flowers. Then we add yellow flowers to the calculation. There are 30 yellow flowers in the garden. Since the number of purple flowers is four higher than the green flowers, add four to 25. Then we multiply that by 10. The number is 49.

This question is asking about how many trail mix packs needed to provide a snack to a baseball team plus their coach's and helpers. \n2. First, we can determine how many different types of players there are in the baseball team. There are 13 members, plus the three coaches, and the two helpers, the base makes it 16.\n3. We can calculate how many trail mix pack is needed taking the number of members of the team \"n\" and the number of packs \"p\". We know that \"n\" is the number of team members and \"m\" is the number of packs \n```\nn = 16\nm = 7\n```\nand therefore\n```\nn = m+2 \n```\n4. We multiply the 16 (that's the number of team members) by the number of bags we must buy (\"m\") to get the total number of bags required to purchase, so \n```\n16 = m+2  ==> m = 16-2\n```\n5.

{"text": "In Krystian's case, he borrows books every day and every Friday he borrows 40% more books than the average he usually borrows during the week. We have to calculate how many books he borrows for the week:\n\n(40+0.40*40)=40.80 books\n\n### Instrumental variable and confounder:\nInstrument:\nIn this solution we take the first day of the week as an \"instrument\", because the week has 7 days, but we ignore the 7th day.\nBecause the number of books borrowed on each day is unchanged. We will find out more about the confounder below.\n\nConfounder:\nThe confounders are variables that are related to the IV, but they cannot be measured for the chosen variable to eliminate the problems.\nIn the given problem, the confounder is the 31st of December. Because on this day of the year, the number of books borrowing can not be calculated because the library is not open anymore.\n\n### Causal reasoning:\nOur strategy would be to look for a causal relationship between the IV and the DV and a possible confounder that is related to both variables and can not be measured.\nFor the IV, there is no confounder because the instrument variable is independent of it.\nFor the DV, the only possible causal relationship with the instrument is a confounder. As the instrument is used for calculation we can say that the number of books borrow on each day is a confounder for our IV.\nThis confounder relates the IV and the DVP in a way that we can not use for calculation, but we find in the table of knowledge.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSo we will make the DVP is 0 every Friday, because the number of books borrow can not be calculated.\nAs the instrument for our calculation we take one day of the week, because the number of DVP is unchanged for each day of the week.\nTaking into account these facts, our original question:\nKrystian works at the library.

In other words, all books other than historical fiction.\n\n### Rationale:\nEach book category, like history, is a known quantity. Using the shelving patterns describes and how Nancy describes how she's shelving them (\"and 4 poetry books\"); you know that she knows how many books are in the category.\n\n### By listing each known category, you can substract how many of them are already shelved and how many are left to shelve.

The sentence provides some hints of what type of motion we need to seek; namely, moving around, both up and out.\n2. Moving down isn't suggested anywhere in context or choice, therefore it can be discarded.\n3. In terms of movement, Choice A: 'up', is disqualified because it isn't what we're seeking for this question.\n4. Choice B: 'up and out' isn't necessarily the answer because there isn't anything else in context that can be said.\n5. Choice E: 'down' could be correct but the question doesn't really specify anywhere how far down or at what height the rocket is intended to be, so again should be disregarded.  \n6.

How long will the workers take to complete the wall if there are exactly 100 workers? Choices: \tA: 5 minutes B: 30 minutes C: 95 minutes D: 55 minutes E: 110 minutes\n\n### Answer:\n\nAnswer E - the workers will take 95 minutes to complete the wall.\n\nThis question is another type of question known as a \"word problem\".\n\nWe need to know the workers can complete 50-feet of the wall every 10-minutes, and so the workers are taking 10-minute breaks.\n\nSo, to answer the question we need to multiply the workers rate of output by the time of the breaks.\n \n### Demonstation:\n\nWe know that the whole wall takes 55-foot and so for the workers to complete 55 - (55/2) will take 75 days.\n\n(100/75) \u2248 3/2 x 200.

{"text": "456\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. We can begin by converting the entire question into a 2 x 2 table such that we can easily find the sum. We put the first question into the first row with Gina's first account going in the second row. \n2. The second question we move into the second row with Betty's account going in the first row; hence the x axis of the table shifts one space to the right. \n3. Hence the first row contains Gina's first bank account with a quarter of the balance which equals $868.\n4. The second row contains Betty's account with a quarter of its balance, which equals $867.\n5. The third column of the table with the sums of the first and second row shows that it is $1735.\n6. From this, we see that the sum of Gina's first and second account is $1734.\n7. Which means our answer is 1734.", "answer": " 1728"}

According to legend, Christ, a Jew from Palestine, was sentenced to crucifixion in Jerusalem in 30 C.E. for his claims to be the son of the Roman pantheon's God. According to the New Testament, Christ's followers were persecuted by Roman authorities on Jesus' order. Christ's teachings began spreading outside Jerusalem. Christ's apostles spread his teachings across the Roman Empire which had significant influence over many Mediterranean societies in places like Rome, Ephesus, and Corinth. Eventually, Roman authorities had Christians arrested and tortured as slaves. However, some prisoners accepted their fates and used Christianity as a form of protest in order to make the torture more extreme, or even to make themselves die as martyrs for their faith. This practice, called \"apostle-making,\" increased the number of Christians in the late first century. \n\n\n \n\n# 1 Solution:\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n# 2) Task Paraphrasing\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nInput: How does light travel?\n\nInput:\n\nRationales:  1.

Therefore, she has eleven fish.\n\n### Solution: (not to be copied)\n\n#### Demonstration: (not to be replicated verbatim)\n1. As the context of this statement reads: \u201cCatriona has 5 more angelfish than a guppy\u201d we can assume, given the number of goldfish in Catriona\u2019s aquarium, that Catriona has more fish overall than another aquarium the size of a goldfish could hold.\n2. The question goes on to state: \u201cShe has twice as many guppy as angelfish.\u201d From this, we can assume that Catriona has twice as many guppi as one goldfish could hold. Additionally, she has twice as much angelfish as one goldfish could carry, given the amount of guppies and goldfish are the same.\n3. In summary, we can deduce that Catriona has 2 angelfish, 1 goldfish and 3 angelfish.\n4. This means that we have 4 angelfish in all.\n5. But, Catriona has more angelfish than what a goldfish could hold at this point and so we must have 5 angelfish.\n6. As angelfish have the same amount of gold fish as angel fish themselves do, from here onward we can assume that Catriona has twice as many angelfish as goldfish.\n7. Substituting goldfish in for angelfish in our previous calculation, we have Catriona with 10 angelfish.\n8. So, Catriona has 10 angelfishes in total, and so we can conclude her aquarium does indeed hold 10 fish.\n9. Catriona has an aquarium full of ten fish: five are angelfish, and the other five of the fish are unknown.\n\n\n### Demostration: (not to copy verbatim)\nGiven the following data:\n\n1.

Choices: A: 12 B: 12/23 C: 1/24 D: 1/25 E: 2 F: half of 6\nRationales:\n1. All of the given numbers are positive, which means they are greater than 0. Therefore, we can discard any negative numbers that may be confusing.\n2. The numbers are all positive integers, which means that they're multiples of 1. Let us take a look at each number in turn.\n3. The number 12 is a multiple of 1, so it's positive.\n4. As for the number 12/24, it is written as a common fraction. It can be written as 1 + 2/24, so it can be evaluated by calculating 24/24. This value is 1, so we know that the fraction is equal to 1. As 1 is positive, then the entire fraction is positive as well.\n5. Let us look at the number 1/25, written as a common fraction as well. It can be written in two equivalent ways as 1 + 1/25 and 1/24. If we use the latter, which is positive, we know it will be a positive number.

We have 15 days of rain in the first half of the month, which means that there are 30 days remaining on the month. Therefore, the remaining 30 days will have twice the number of rainfall.\n3. We use the given information and plug it into a function which calculates the average in each of the 30 days.\n4. Then, we add the average rainfall for the first 15 to the answer for the latter 15 days.\n5.

{"text": "Answer: The answer is 15 feet.\n\n### Why did we use `15` instead of `1.5`?\nAn alternative approach to the answer could have used `1.5` as the width - a value of `1.5` is the width of a rectangle with a perimeter of `30` and a length of `2.5`, but we chose `15` instead. For two reasons.\n\nFirst, there were no clues in the question about the unit of measurement of the lengths. In this case, we chose to use feet. If there are clues in the question, we'll let the user choose the unit.\n\nThe second reason we chose `15`, is that we have to consider the context of the question.\n\nThe user likely wrote the question to test basic algebraic skills. We wouldn't want to make the user think twice about whether they should use `1.5` or `15`, as that will slow the user down - both in writing and in solving the question, not to mention the frustration of not writing a question correctly from the first time.\n\nAn alternative method is to use the same number for calculations and the answer to check whether the math is correct.

{"text": "The number of green balls is 40.\n\n### Answer Rationale:\nGiven the information in the task, we know that Ryan has 40 balls total and that 11 blue balls are in equal proportion with twice as many red balls compared to blue. We also know that the other, remaining, balls are green. By substituting numbers for each of these categories, we can solve for the number of green balls in the group.\n\nRyan has red and blue balls totaling 20 and green balls totaling 40.\nBy considering the 20:12:11 format of the original text, we can create a 3x2 equation which is equal to 2x1 where x is equal to the number of green balls. Therefore, we can say that 40 = 2x \n\nThis indicates that 2 is the value for x and 2x = 40. If we expand this equation, we can get x = 20 and therefore, we know the number of green balls is equal to 40.\nInput: Which of these activities could you perform underwater in a swimming pool: swimming, paddling, eating, walking, breathing  or reading?

The non-discounted bottles cost $50 times 3, which is $150\n\nSo, the champagne costs $230.\n\nNext, let\u2019s estimate how much Jackson\u2019s girlfriend wants to splurge by taking the first approximation of 1 quart, which is 4 cups.\n\n1. 1 gallon times 4, which works out to be 4 gallons\n2. 4 gallons times 4 cups per gallon, which works out to 16 cups\n\nSo Jackson buys 16+1=17 cups worth of champagne, which is roughly 64 ounces.\n\nNow, let\u2019s estimate the volume of the hot tub using the formula 128 fluid ounces equals 1 gallon.\n\n1. $16 times 128 comes out to be $2008 \n\nNow, let's subtract $230 from $2008 to get the volume of liquid in the hot tub.\n\n1. $$2008 - 230 = 1778$$\n\nSo, Jackson has $1778 worth of drinks left in the hot tub. \n\nFinally, let\u2019s get the total worth of champagne he got.\n\n1.

Multiplying 2.5 ounce by 4 gives us 10 ounces.\n4. Rounding up to whole gallons, 199 quarts of champagne fit into the tub of champagne which is $8 in total (395 gallons divided by.20 per gallon).\n5. Jackson has bought 199 quarters of champagne for 2.5", "answer": " 6400"}

However, the trick is to deconstruct the information to build a model. The most challenging type of questions will require you to break the information down into simpler parts before coming up with an appropriate answer.\n\n## Tips\n1. Understand the context of the question and read the question thoroughly, then look at all possible options carefully. Be sure to read through each option's rationales to see what's being said, even if you think a single answer is correct \u2013 it is critical to cover all bases.\n2. Use logical reasoning to determine what the questions are asking and eliminate wrong choices. Often, you will be asked to compare two things. For example, compare the prices of two particular books in a store.\n3. Use knowledge and intuition to make educated guesses. However, be careful not to over-answer based solely on intuition. Always be aware of the type of question you are answering to determine what types of knowledge are needed.\n4. Try to understand what the question is looking for. You may have to build models to think about certain questions, even though not all questions require model-building.\n5. Be sure to look at all the options for each question, as you may have to rule out some of them before you answer the question correctly.", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "* I believe the sum of all attendees should be counted and the total value obtained. If we have $100 per person in the total contributions, the total amount should be *$5000*. Then deduct the cost of the party $500, and the total money left should be *$4500*. If we have $50 people in the party, then the amount left after the party is *$450* ( $4500 / 50 ).\n\nThis is how I understand the explanation above, and the conclusion is very consistent with it. I agree with the author to some level, but the part that says if there were 500 people in the party would make no difference as we can deduct $50 per person to the total balance, which means *$250*.\n\nInput: Deduct the difference of seven dollars from 83 plus the product of 5 and eight.

You just need to simplify the subtraction and multiply by the whole number *5* instead of *8* in part *A* because *5* was part of the number *83*.

I'd rather suggest to check the total amount of gallon in the truck. You can do the subtraction from 60-85 and obtain negative (-135), which equals to 77 gallons. That's how I understand it.

We found that since pillows contain circles and a pillow represents the entire circle and pillow, then the number of circles per pillow is \u214b, or 6/8. Additionally, we must consider the number of white circles on each pillow, which is 1/(\u214b), or the reciprocal of 8/6, giving us \u2154. Now, we are ready to begin the calculation.\n2. Beginning with choice A, we see that the answer would need to be a whole number. We also know that we are trying to find the number of circles remaining, which is what choice 1, A, would be assuming that all pillows were completely severed.\n3. Choice D shows us that the answer is a multiple of 10, which can't be the answer since a multiple of 4 does exist in the numbers provided.\n4. Similar to choice D, choice E excludes choice A, as it has a number that's too great.\n5. Choice B contains the best answer, a multiple of 4, which is a whole number.

Firstly, we need to know that markup means the profit one makes on making an item. \n2. The question states that the markup is 25%, meaning the gas is sold at a markup of 100/100 = 1. \n3. The markup in percentage form is: 100% - 75%. \n4. This equals 25%. \n5. Knowing that the price is a dollar, we get 1 - (1/25) = 1/4\nOr 1 dollar - (25 cents/1 dollar) = 1/25, meaning that each gallon of gas costs 1/4 of a dollar, or 25% of a dollar, that is, 21 cents.", "answer": " 294"}

{"text": "To calculate this problem, we need to first decide the number of rectangular tables and the number of squares needed to seat 90 students. We note that the question states that there are already 7 \"rectangular tables.\" This implies that there are 7 total tables. Thus the number of squares we will need is 90-7 = 83. The remaining 7 tables must now be distributed among these 83 squares. As the question states, there are only 10 students on each rectangle table and each square table only seats 4 students. This implies that each of the 7 rectangle tables can seat 10 x 7 = 70 students. As there are now only 7 tables, the 14 remaining students must be put on 7 squares. We divide 70 by 4 to get 17.

Hence, after day 1, it would be 6.8 + 1.5 = 8.3 inches tall |\n| B. 42 | Grandpa's farm received 22 inches of snow over 4 days, so by day 4 it received 34 inches. 34 -22 = 12 which is not enough to fully melt off the drift by day 4, which, is 34 inches. Hence, the answer by day 4 is already 34 inches = 12.5 inches high by day 3, resulting in total snow over 4 days of 34 inches + 18 inches = 52 inches or 4.5 inches per day |\n| A. 15 | Grandpa's snowy farm only received an initial 15 inches of snow (34 - 18 = 16; 16 = 40%).

It means Melissa is spending 10 dollars, so she's buying two pens.\n3 the final cost is added: 100-10-2 = 10-30\n\n### Explanation: 1. This is because Tolu also wants 2 pens.\n\n### Solution:20 cent * 5 =1 dollars 20 cent * 3 =1.5 dollars 60 cent * 2=3 dollars 60 cent 3 * 20 = 10 dollars. \nTotal cost = (3+0.5+1+3) dollars", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "The method is to use basic formulas from arithmetic, the formula being x=y+z.  After solving the equation, the total time it took Fernanda to listen to the six audiobooks is 243.

Add rationale where necessary to help make your response acceptable.\nInput: If you join an expensive gym to lose weight, can you make it up to your coworkers afterward?\n1. No. It is not recommended to join expensive gyms in attempts to lose weight.\n2.

Can you please help me?\n\n### Output: Where was the flower box left?\nAnswers: In front of the bus stop (in the morning)\n\n### Instructor:\nThe idea of this question is that we are trying to find out where the bus passenger left his box of flowers. As a passenger on a bus, the logical thing to do is to look at the question as a problem-solver at the bus stop to find out where the passenger had picked up the box of flowers. Remember, you are the passenger and someone has asked you to put yourself back in the passenger\u2019s shoes and decide where the flowers were left by the passenger.\n\n### Example 1:\nWhen you are leaving your house for your bus stop, you will most likely start from the front door. Then you will walk along the main road, until you find a stop for the bus for your destination. The box of flowers will most likely be taken from there unless someone carries it to another bus for them and brings back to the front door.\n\n### Demo:\n* [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn1YIrIH56k&feature=emb_", "answer": " 27"}

Determine what isn't true of the options and eliminate them.\n\n\n\nInput: What game is two teams consisting of 7 players trying to take the ball to certain zones in order to score more points than the other team? Choices:  a: soccer b: streetball c: dodgeball d: rugby e: baseball\n\nRationales:\n1. We begin by looking at the structure of the question. It'll help guide our decision.\n2. \"What game?\" can be eliminated because it is not the main question of the task. \n3. This game consists of teams.\n4. We cross out choice b because \"streeball\" doesn't include 7 players on each team.\n5. We also cross out e because \"baseball\" doesn't include two teams.\n6", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "Lake Crystal has 20% fewer frogs than Lasse Lake. This means there are less frogs in lake crystal than there were in Lasse Lake. Lake Crystal currently has 60 frogs, while there were 75 frogs in Lake Lasse. Therefore, there are approximately 15 frogs in Lake Crystal.\n\n### Detailed solution:\nFirst, we will find the number of frogs in Lasse Lake by using our knowledge of percentages to determine the percentage of frogs in Lake Crysta compared to the frog population in Lake Lasse. We know that Lake Crystal has 2/5 the number of frogs, which corresponds to 15 frogs.\nAs a result of our calculation, the number of frogs remaining in Lake Lasse is 75 \u2013 15 = 60.\nNow that we know the number of frogs currently in Lake Lasse, we can solve for the number of frogs total in both lakes.\nTo do so, write Lake Crystal\u2019s current frog population as a ratio, 60/155.  Then write out Lake Lasse\u2019s current frog count and Lake Crystal\u2019s frog count as an equivalent fraction, 75/155.\nNext, write both expressions using like numerators, 3/5.\nMultiply the numerators by the denominator and simplify.\nThe answer will be the quotient of the fractional expressions, 3/5 \u00d7 frog_count in Lake Lasse.

It simply means it's not open to the general public, which could be either public or national. (5) a national park: this is not local therefore not a local park.  Moreover a national park by definition is open to the public.  By implication, it's also not private and is a public park as public and national park have been ruled out.

We must understand the question, which asks us to determine which answer choice represents the number of floors below the number '0'.\n2. We begin by eliminating any options that are out of range or do not correspond to the question.\n3. The first option, choice A: '2', does not correspond to the question, as it does not express any number of floors below '0'.\n4. Next, choice B: '1', is also out of range as they are asking for a negative number of floors, not a positive one.\n5. Similarly, choice C: '8', does not account for any negative number of floors below 0.\n6. We can now focus on the remaining choices, which correspond to the question. Choice D: '10', and choice E: '-13' are incorrect because their numbers do not follow the pattern required in question.\n7. Choices F: '-2' and G: '-22' both utilize the same pattern of subtracting the height of the floor below the ground (i.e. -13) from the 10th.

One A: 55mph B: 70mph C: 60mph D: 35mph E: 45mph\nRationales: First we need to figure out how many miles an hour the car was moving. We know that the car went 75 miles, then we subtract the time that there was gas, we have ten minutes (we don't subtract the ten minutes from the original 75 because then we would get negative numbers). If we subtract 10 from 75, we get 65 so we will say the car was going 65 miles an hour.\nNow we need to find out how many speeds there are. We do this by looking at the speeds that are going by, we can see that they are 55 and 35 so we would multiply 65 by 55, then subtract 65 from 45, and lastly 65 by 35.\nSo the car went slow (45 + 20 = 65), fast (65 - 65 = 0), then 65 + 35 (65 - 20) = 125 miles per hour.\nTherefore there are 3 speeds.\nAnswer: D: Three, because there arer three speeds.\n\n### Question:  Input: The referee called time when there was ten seconds left in the first half.

He wants to have the same percentage of salt in the remaining water after it evaporates. He will collect as little water as possible, thus having a higher amount of salt. Using this information, we can use proportions to solve this question.\n\nWe know that 1 ml of salt = 4.33 X 10-5 ml of water\n\n20% of 2 liters = 0.0465 liters\n\n1 ml = 0.001 liters\n\n0.04635 liters = 0 ml\n\n50% of 0.04588 would be 0.02294 ml\n\n0.02275 ml would be the salt per liter\n\nWe could say that every 3.33 liters would have a 0.0744 ml concentration of salt in it.\n\nAnswer: 33 Liters = 32.8571428 ml\n\n0,0744 m\u2113 = 1.7110572 ml\n\nm, l = 32/0,074 = 428 ml/0,0774 = 5469.95 ml\n\n5470 ml = 0,074 m\u2113\n\nAnswer 1: 5469 x 428 = 23532 x 2 = 47064 ml\n\nAnswer 2: 47068 x 2 = 94136 ml x 2 = 188271 ml\n\n### Input and response:\nInput: How much did it cost for the team to order their out of state sandwiches?\n\nThe cost is the total price multiplied by the number items ordered.\n\nInput: What is the total cost when they order four pizzas and one sandwich?\n\nThis is the total amount it cost for the team ordered.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: Where should the basketball team go for a team", "answer": " 400"}
{"text": "Answer: 1/8 of a pizza pie, or exactly 1/32 of the cut pizzas.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n\nWe know from the question that Ann eats 75% of her pizza, Bill eats 50% of his pizza, and Cate and Dale each eat 50% as well.\n\nBecause the pizzas are cut into 4 pieces, each person is left with 1/4 piece. Ann, Bill, and Cate each have 1/4 pizza, while Dale has 1/2.\n\nSince Ann is left with 1 1/2 pizzas, Bill is left with 1, Cate has 5/8, and Dale has 7/8.\n\nTo get the percentage, we have to find the sum of the parts divided by the total. 1/4 + 1/4 +5/8 + 7/8 = 15/8 + 12/8 = 27/8 = 3/8.\n\nMultiply this by 4 to get the fraction of the pizza which is left, and you get 3/8. Rounding that down to the nearest decimal you get 0.375 or 0.37, which is 37.5% of your pizza left.\n\nAnswer: 37.50%, or 37.5 for the answer.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "Herman will need 3 cups of food for the three months.\n<img src=\"../assets/images/mathwordproblem2.png\" />\n\n#### Explanation:\nWe have three pieces of information. It can be assumed to be 2/6 cups of food per day because each month is 1/3 months. The formula for finding the total number needed = Months X Daily Amount X How often.\n* In this case, it would be M= 2 X 1/2 X 2= 1 in this case. Daily amount times how often per day would give us 1 cup of food per day for 1 month. This would make sense given that we only had 2/6 cupes a day of food per month because we wouldn't have enough food to survive over the months we have.  To find the equation for all of these together, we could see that it is simply.\n* M x 1/6 x 1/day\n* 1 x 1/6 X 2 = 1 cup a day X 3 days = 3 cups of Bird food.\nHence, 3 cups of bird food will be needed.\n\n### Input : I have a dog.

{"text": "The solution to this problem is as follows:\n1. Rosie runs 6 miles an hour so the total running time in one day equals 6 times the number of miles.\n2. Monday she runs for 1 hour so the running time equals 1 hour times the total number of miles run on Monday which is 6 miles so the running time in a one hour is also 6 miles.\n3. The running time on Tuesday is 30 minutes so the running time for one day in Tuesday equals that hour divided by three times 6 miles equals one hour times 2 miles. \n4. Wednesday, she ran for one hour so she ran for 31 minutes for 6 miles so the total running time on Wednesday is 31 minutes times 6 miles.\n5. On Thursday, Rosie ran for 20 minutes, so for 6 miles, her total running time for the day is 33 minutes.\n6. Therefore the total running time for the week is, 60 minutes Monday, 30 minute Tuesday, 60 minutes Wednesday, and a 30 minute Thursday.\n7. She wants to run 23 miles (6 miles Monday, 4 miles Wednesday, 3 miles Thursday), so Friday's running time equals 60 minutes Friday minus 135 minutes total running time divided by the average of all the days 30 minutes. \n8.

{"text": "6\n\n### Demostration:\n1. To answer this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts.\n2. First, let's look at the dimensions of Lucille's room. We know that two walls are 3 meters each wide and 2 meters each tall, which is 54 sq. meters. The third wall is five meters each wide and 4 meters each tall, which equals 50 sq. meters. The fourth wall has a width of four meters and is 2 meters each tall which equals 8 sq. meters. Finally, the total area of the room equals 170 sq. meters.\n3. Now, let's calculate how many cans of the paint Lucille will need. One can of paint, according to the problem, covers 2 sq. meters, so we multiply 2 times each dimension (3 times 2, 4 times 2, and 5 times 2): 6, 8, and 10, respectively. The sum of all the dimensions is 170. The sum of the products for each wall is 54 + 10 + 50 + 8 + 10 +10 + 10+ 8 + 8 = 242. To get the answer, we subtract 242 from 170: 170 - 242 = (242 - 170) = -72.  Since Lucille needs -72 cans of paint, the answer is 72. The next step is to change 72 into a rational form. This is done as follows: 72 = 6x12 = 7x10\n4. The answer finally is 70 cans of paint.\n5. To recap, Lucille needs 70 cans to cover the 170 sq meters of her room.\nAnswer: 72", "answer": " 15"}

To make this decision, you need to: **identify what the request refers to by considering the context and using clues from the author's/test creator's instructions** to determine if a statement is true or false; **analyze how the response follows the structure and sequence of the request and identify whether it is correct or incorrect**.\n\n### Subtask 1: Identify the correct response.\nGiven the information provided in the question, we can conclude that: \"It takes David 19 minutes to wash 24 windows.\" The statement is true based on the information given in the problem. \n\n### Sub-task 2: Justify your decision.\nFrom the above information, it seems that the question is asking how long it will take David to wash the entire house, if he took 10 minutes per window.\nWe know that David has 64 windows, and it takes him 10 minutes to clean each window.

{"text": "She spends \\$90.\nInput: What is 25 percent of 333? Choices: A:33 B:46 C:75 D:43 E:None of these\nRationales:1. We can first start by eliminating choice A:33. To calculate a percentage, we must multiply the decimal by the numerator and then add the denominator. If we do this with choice 25, we get.25 * 333 = \\$83. With 25% of 333, we are to do this calculation so 25% of the given number will equal 333, so we must then subtract 333 from 100. With 25%, the percentage is made up of.25 (25%) of the number. By this reasoning, the answer will, instead of be a higher number than 100, be.75 * 332. So, 332 minus 333 will be negative.1 so 332 will subtract from 334 to give a total of 25% - 1 = 24%.\n2. Choice B is also incorrect as a percentage means that the given number is being taken out of the total whole. Using the original question, we have 25%, meaning that 25% of a given number is being used to total the number that is being taken from. With this logic, the problematic number would be 333. To calculate 25% of this, we must multiply.25 * 100. Using the original number of 333 and the percentage as shown in the problem, we must use 75 to get the remainder of the percentage. This means that 333 *.25 / 100 =.3325 since 333 is less than 100. Then the remainder is.75. 333-35.25 = 298.\n3. Choice C: 75 is close, but, using the logic previously explained, it is incorrect as the remaining number must be less than 10 so that the total whole does not get larger than the given total of 333.\n4.

{"text": "Greg's experience of rain was reduced by 21 mm.\n\n## Instructions:A. Explain the difference between a variable and a constant.\n\n## Rationale:In Python, a _blank_ indicates another variable that stores a different value. Thus, a variable is an identifier that stores data and is often linked to a value. It is also possible for a variable to not have a value or have a default value. \n\n## B. Answer the following question.\n\n## Rationales:\n## 1. The answer is A. In Python, the variable \"a\" always refers to the number zero.\n## 2. This is because Python's indentation convention means that all code after an indented section of lines or block must be within the same scope as the indented section. This includes the lines of code indented with the keyword \"a\". As \"a\" is an identifying marker for an identifier, it is only used to indicate the identifier and can not have a value itself.\n## 3. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: all variable names must include a letter and only letters, not numbers, in Python.\n## 4. The letters cannot begin with a zero.\n## 5. The second example does not show a letter or a single number as an identifier. To be considered an identifier in Python, it must have both a letter and a number at its start, such as 'z' or 'n'. Therefore, the identifier in this example is \"z\".\n## 6. The variable \"z\" is not a number, but a variable. As this is a variable, it is possible for it to hold a different value when used under different conditions.\n## 7. In the third example, a, b, and c are not identifiers, but rather variables. The variable a will reference the value 15 in the condition \"if a and b and c\".\n## 8. If the condition \"if a or b or c\" is used instead, it will reference 25. The value that is referenced by the identifier a will be influenced by any other variables used, such as b or c.\n## 9. Therefore, the answer must be A.\n## 10. In the fourth example, a and b have the same value at the beginning of each if condition and change according to the other conditions.\n## 1", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "The answer should read \u201c2400\u201d.\n\n### Explication:\nTo properly answer a mathematical problem, it is necessary to understand the context and format of the problem. In this exercise, Ian is trying to burn calories by jogging around an apartment complex for 5 laps. We need to figure out how many calories Ian is burning after 5 days of running.\n\nTo start, we need to define exactly what a lap is and how it impacts the total distance. The text specifies that each lap is 10 feet long. So each lap is made up of 100 ft. of jogging.\n\nWe need to make a hypothesis about the type of jogging. Since it is not explicitly stated, we can assume it is an estimate of the distance travelled while jogging. So this would be equivalent to jogging for 5 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how much calories are needed to burn through one 5 minute jog. To figure this out, we need to understand how much energy a body has to burn to move. According to the text, we\u2019re looking for specifics about the amount of calories burned and the distance travelled. So we can simplify to say that a body needs \u201cx\u201d amount of calories to travel \u201cx\u201d amount of yards/meters while \u201cy\u201d is the speed or force at which that movement happens.\n\nAccording to this equation there is an equation to find the answer.\n\nThe answer will come out to 2500+100+x+x^2 \nIf you subtract one from the right side of the equation you make 2500 more from the right side. This gives the answer of 2400 calories, which is only one away from the answer given.\n\nComment: Please refrain from posting answers as discussion comments.

Choices: A: increased biodiversity B: decrease in biodiversity C: no change D: increased pollution\nRationales:\n1. To answer, we first understand context. The question asks us to identify what occurred when humans poured bleech into a river already contaminated from  an oil spill.\n2. Oil spills can directly impact biodiversity, which is the number and variety of living organisms in a habitat. Thus, we can eliminate D: increased pollution and C: No change as they do not refer to biodiversity.\n3. Bleech typically acts as a bleacher, which kills germs and removes stains by reacting with organic molecules (like dirt or oil) but does not affect biodiversity.\n4. Biodiversity did not increase as a result of humans pouring bleech into the river since bleech typically does not have any effect on biodiversity.\n5. Choices, B: \"Decrease in biodiversity\" and A: \"increased biodiversity\" suggest that biodiversity was initially negatively affected and then positively affected as a result of bleech.\n6. Thus, biodiversity did not decrease as a result of humans adding bleech to the oil-contaminated river.\n7. Additionally, it doesn't make sense that biodiversity would increase as a result. The only organic molecules bleech would react with in the river are those from either the oil spill or from plant and animal life. So even if those plant and animal life were biodiversity, they would be impacted rather than increased in biodiversity.\n8. Therefore we can identify that B: \"decrease in biodiversity, in fact, occurred.\nAnswer: B: \"Decreased in biodiversity\"\n \n### Input: There is an island made up of several small islands.

{"text": "Let a = Harvey\u2019s total miles and b = Sam\u2019s total miles.\n\nWe can set up an equation to determine our final number.\n\na + b = 8\n\nMultiplying both sides be 8.\n\na - b = 8\nWe can now isolate a variable and subtract our starting variable from both sides of the equation.

We are using the fact that the normal month is 4 weeks so to adjust to get the average take the total of 4 and divide it by 12 to get 4/12 = 0.33 so to multiply or divide we just move over two places right? Or we could also divide 12 by 4 and get 3.\n\nThence the total number of days in a month is 4 weeks or 12 1/3 days.\n\n### Answer:\nIn the first solution attempt, I found the average to be 4/12 (0.33). After that, I multiplied and found that 4 * 12 = 48. In the second solution attempt, I simplified 48 by 3 and found that 16 days = 7 weeks.

Given the question that she used 12 min so far, it is evident that she has to answer at least 64 questions in the next 58 min. (58-12 = 46 min)\n\n2. Given that maths is in the equation then 20 min = 16/2 = 8, 50 min = 72/2 = 36, 80 min = 76/2 = 38, we can deduce that the possible option is A = 80, B = 76, C = 72 or D = 75.\n\n 3.

We can now use this calculation to solve for the question.\n\t\n\t240 tickets won\n\n\t320 lost\n\n\tProfit/loss: -600\n\n\tIf we subtract 600 from the expected value of winning tickets ( 1600), we get\n\t\n\t1000 = Profit\n\n5. We know that there is only one winner of the grand prize, which will be worth $5000.\n\t\n\t5000 - 400 = $4600\n\n6. Therefore, we will subtract 4600 from the total winnings, which will leave us with the total profit.\n\n\t4600 - 1000 = $3600\n\n7. To answer the question, we simply subtract the $4600 from $1600 to get the total profit;\n\n\t3600 - 4600 = -1000\n\n\tSo the total profit would be $1600 - 700 = $900.\n8.

Let me try and explain why.\n\n#### Background\n\nFirst of all, some context is required. When reading the question, we have to understand the words and their definitions. One definition was provided as body parts and the other provided as words to make a definition. The first definition is a part of a human body. It has to be more than just a single word like eyelid, it would be something like fingers. The second definition is a bone. It must be more than just a few words like ankle bone. We must use some words to describe the bone and also have a countable noun. Therefore, we must use an article like a foot or a part of the body. I went through the definitions and came to the conclusion that this is the easiest one and it is also simple when trying to find context for this question.\n\n#### Steps\n\nI believe the first step was to understand the words in this statement and see what we must do. We want to be more specific because we only want to cover body parts not whole definitions.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is understand the word has in this question.

Now if the pitcher threw a curve ball, then the batter can swing at it (and also get a hit), avoid a strike (which also gets the batter a hit), or he can strike out (which results in an out).\n\nHere's a quick summary of what to do based on what type of pitch the pitcher throws.\n\nFastball\n- If they can hit it (resulting in a hit)\n- If they can avoid a strike (resulting in a strike instead of a strikeout)\n- If they miss a ball (hitting it results in a hit, missing it results in a strikeout)\n\nCurve Ball\n- If they can swing at it (resulting in another hit)\n- If the avoid a strike (then the batter will receive a strike instead of a out)\n\nFurther, if they have a curveball and they swing, then we can think of that ball as a fastball and it's up to the batter as outlined above.\n\nAnswer: Hit: You", "answer": " 45"}

(Question: If Mark eventually exceeded the recommended daily intake by 142%, how many bars of these candies did Mark take? The choices here are 28 bars.

Choices: A: He was lost in the woods B: He was running C: He found his favorite place D: He started running really fast E: He could feel his heart beating fast\nRationales: To determine the choice that indicates Buddy is upset, we can first understand what \u2018upset\u2019 could mean in this context.\n1. In the real world, it could mean feeling angry, sad or worried \u2013 all these imply emotional instability and hence could be inferred to be an emotional state.\n2. The statement, \u201c\u2026so upset about being lost [that] he started running really fast\u201d, shows us Buddy is worried or unhappy.\n3. This is reflected by Buddy\u2019s choice of words: \u201cso upset\u2026\u201d.\n4. Next we move to the second option, D: He started running fast.\n5. While this choice has fast running as an element, it\u2019s just that \u2014 an element. It\u2019s not specific to how or under what circumstances Buddy is running fast.\n6. And lastly we have choice which states him feeling the heartbeat. This can\u2019t be taken to mean feeling upset as it is not the cause here.\n7. Hence, the correct answer is choice B: He was running fast.\nAnswer: B: He started running fast\n\n### Input\"There is a problem with the door because it's not working. So, there must be some faults.

For the first rope (8-foot) there would be a 2-foot gap between the ends of the rope and the other two ropes. There would be a knot in each rope connecting them together at every other foot.

{"text": "To correctly answer this, we need to first calculate the area of the house. Multiplying the length (20.5 feet) by the width (10 feet), we get 205. What\u2019s the area of the porch, though? It looks something like this:\n\n4.5 \u00d7 6 = 27. With 205 feet in the shape of the house and 27 feet in the shape of its porch, the area of the entire structure would be 205 feet squared.\nThere are two different shapes of this area: a rectangle or a parallelogram (a more irregular shape where two sides are longer). To find shingle prices per square foot, we multiply 3 (the price per square foot) by 2 (how many feet in the shape of house) to discover the total price of shingles, which is $60. With $60 in our pocket and 27 feet for the area of the porches, it\u2019d come out to $2.21 per square foot (which is rounded to $2.25).\n\nLet\u2019s add the two totals up to find the total area of the house and the porches: 205 + 27 = 232 square feet. Since we know that it takes about 10 square shingles to form a square foot, we simply take the number of square shingles (10) and multiply it by the total number of square feet (232), which comes out to 2,320 square feet.

{"text": "### Reason:\nIt is impossible to tell exactly how many apples Pam has without a calculation to figure out how many she has.\n\n### Justify:\n\nSince Gerald's baggage could have more or fewer amount of apples than 3, it can't be 10 bags exactly since that would make Gerald have the same amount as Pam.\n\n### Explanation:\nIt is not possible to tell how many bags Pam has by looking at Gerald's bargage because we would need to know how many apples he has in each bag.\n\nSince we don't have that information, it can't determine how many Gerald's baskets contain without seeing if Pam has bags with different numbers of bags.\n\n### Example:\nIf Gerald's bagger was made up of only 7 apples then Gerald would need 2 times 3 bags to equal 10 bags. In this case, Pam would need 1 bag since there is no 10 bags or any 3 bags.\n<br>In order to get the correct answer, you would need to have a calculation to figure the amount of each bag. So, even if Gerald's basket was 9 bags, you would not know Pam's number of baskets with 9 apples in them.", "answer": " 1200"}

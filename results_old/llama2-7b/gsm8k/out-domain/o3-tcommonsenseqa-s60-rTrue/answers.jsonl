How many different kinds of fish can be caught by both of them after fished out of the river?\n\n### Demostrate:\nInput: How many different kinds of \nfish after fished out of \nthe river\n\n### Response\n\n\nRational: The equation to use in this question is P\u2081 (choose this first fish) = R\u2081 \u2013 G\u2081 (choose this first red fish) where the symbols P\u2081, R\u2081, G\u2081 etc represent the population of the chosen fish, the red fish that were caught, and the green fish that were caught (the minus sign used is for a subtraction rather than division). To know the population of the first fish, we calculate it using the population of the red fish (R\u2081) minus the population of the green fish (G\u2081) \u2013 this is the equation (P\u2081 = R\u2081 \u2013 G1). Now we must repeat this one more time, so we use the other fish from the two fish (the green fish from the first example) (G\u2082) to find the population (P\u2082), the population of the red (R\u2082) in the population (P\u2082 = R\u2082- G\u2082), and, finally, for the red fish, the population (B\u2082) ( B = the blue fish", "answer": " 126"}

The question is how many packages did the butcher delivered.\n\nIn this equation, the total quantity of ground beef delivered by all three butchers is 100 lbs and each package weighs 4 pounds. Therefore, the total number of packages received is 25. Then, each butcher delivered a weight that is equal to (his total delivery/his total deliveries) or (his/her total deliveries).\n\nThe first butcher received 4100-1400=2700 and the total number of packages he delivered is `(2700/25)`. \nSimilarly, the second butcher received 6900-2800=4100 and the total deliveries he made is `(4100/25)` and the third butcher delivered 3100-800=2100 and the complete packages received by him is `(2100/29)`.\n\nTherefore, the total number of deliveries made by the 3 butchers is 3800.

E: 4 pictures\n\nReasoning: 1. The picture drawn by the friends of Sam is irrelevant for calculating the answer, as it is a factor affecting the number of pictures drawn that is not of interest.\n2. It is stated that the pictures are drawn by Sam's friends. This means it is a collaborative activity among those friends, and hence the number of pictures drawn is the sum of pictures each friend draws. This means the answer choice 5 - 4 pictures is the correct one.\n3.

The original question uses a number which looks as though it is in dollars but was likely entered by mistake as liter.  The second sentence of original question also uses $2.80 per liter and $15.40 per gallon, making it likely that it also used a typographical error and should read $2.80 in the first sentence and $2.83 in the second.

So the answer is that the packs cost 4.50 each.\n\n### Input : In how many different ways can 4 people sit at a table if we can\u2019t sit 3 people next to each other all in the same row?\n\n### Reponse:\nif n means one place, and i means all of it, then x and y can\u2019t both sit together so we need to account for them as n-1 and n-2, respectively. Now because n doesn\u2019t vary and there are 4 i, we can just subtract n from y, or substitute the formula x-1=y-n. \n\nSince 2 seats are already taken, and 4 people are there in total, the 3 extra person can sit anywhere. and we have to subtract 3 from y, we can then substitute the equation x-1=y(3).\n\nThe 3 more people left can sit in rows of two, the first row, the second row and the fourth one, one can get 1, 2,4,7, as the answer and the second as 1,3,5,8, or the third as 2,3,6,9,\n  or 3,4,7,10\n\nThe 3 and 2 can only sit where the 1 and 4 are, respectively.\n\nTherefore the 4 remaining people have 4 seats in the second option and the 3 remaining in the first and third with any person having any seat.

{"text": "Input: The instructions describe the costs for the items for Kevin and his children and ask to explain how much Kevin has to pay including the sales tax. The total amount of the items does not matter as long as the sales tax is included, so the question is answered based on the number of jackets, that Kevin wants to buy. In total, Kevin buys 11 T-shirts ($8 each), 5 sweaters ($18 each), and 5 jackets (price per jacket is $80 - $10 = $70). From that, it can be subtracted that Kevin would pay $705 for all the items if he wasn't able to apply the 10% discunt for the jackets, because of the difference between jacket value before and after the discount.\n\nRationales:\n\nExplanation: Kevin would spend $730 on his children's clothes, without applying the 10% jacket discount. But he would have to pay the additional $15, because he used the 10% off, and now he has to pay only $8 for his jacket and $4 extra sales tax, and the overall amount of $730 minus the $34 (4x$8) equals $705.\n\nThe answer is: $705, with the sales tax of $34.\n\nAnswer: \n\n### Input\n\"The old man, his wife, and his two sons went out for dinner.

A story can be told in many ways, some stories are based on action and others on narrative, but all stories have certain common elements.\n\n* The most common form of story structure is the hero's journey. The hero's journey begins with a normal, every-day world. In this world something occurs that upsets the balance. It could be a call to adventure or some other force from the outside world, but whatever it is, the hero must go on a journey to find a solution to the problem. On the journey, the hero faces many challenges and risks. At some point, the hero overcomes the hurdles and returns to normal life.\n\n* Other story structures are The Odyssey, the fairy tale, and the fable. These are all based on a linear timeline; however, they are not as complicated as the hero's journey, and they are written or oral traditions.\n\nThe Odyssey, the ancient Greek epic poem, is divided into 24 books.

I picked A, because there was only one piece of bread on each plate.\n### Explain your answer. \nThis is a question about a woman at a bakery who put each piece of bread onto its own plate. There are three jobs she is responsible for: bird, cat, and monkey. \nThe bird is when she takes each loaf of bread and puts it on the shelf, so that they are evenly distributed. The cat job is when she gets the tray of bread from the store's oven, and puts it down on the counter, ensuring that one loaf is put on each plate so that there is an even distribution of products. The monkey job is when she puts each doughnut that has been made on a plate. \nThe monkey job is the easiest because monkeys are a bit like cats, they can pick up things, grab something, stick them on something else, and put them back down again. The bird job requires a lot of effort and time because they have to organize everything very neatly, which can take up a lot of time. \nThe cat job is a bit in the middle. \nThe cat is actually a bit of a monkey.  \nThe cat job requires a lot of time because when a customer wants a certain type of bread, then the bread has to be taken out of the tray and put onto the plate. This can take a lot of time and effort.  \nThe cat is a bit like an animal, it can be lazy and it can pick something up and put it somewhere else, which shows that the cat job is actually the easiest job out of the three.\n\n### Comments:", "answer": " 5"}

He has a friend with a car.  He only needs to take a fraction of the amount of time it will take.  Is that possible?Choices:  A: yes, he can take 20% B: no, he has to take at least 90% C: no, unless he and his friend can divide the seats\nRationales: This task is ambiguous and could have various meanings.\nReasoning:\n1. To find out exactly what the author wanted, we're looking for information on the car, not on the mall or the amount of time.\n2. The only information we get on the car is that it can fit 4 passengers.\n3. For the task to be relevant, the friend and his car must be relevant to the car.\n4. This is not the case for any of the choices.  For example, in A and B, the passenger is irrelevant to the car but is still relevant to the mall.\n5. In C, while the friend and his car are relevant to the car, he has nothing else to do with the mall or the time.\n6. Finally, any other choice that deals with passengers in the car are just unrelated statements that don't answer the question.  It seems that the right option only comes down to C: no, unless the two people can divide the seats because the car can fit 4 passengers only.  This means that the passenger can't go by themselves, so either one of them can't go at all, or they have to both travel.\n7. For the final answer, A and B are not possible because they don't have 1/4 of the time to get to the malls, but C is because it is about the car.\nAnswer:C: no, unless the 2 people can divide the seats\n\n### Input James and his wife want to go skiing.

{"text": "Libby used a total of 51 bricks of snow.\n### Rationales: The task instructs the student to determine the total number of bricks of snow that Libby used for her igloo. The task provides the number of bricks of ice Libby used for the bottom of the igloo, as well as the number of bricks used for the top of the igloo. From here, we can use the rules of addition to determine the total number. The bottom half of Libby's igloo has 24 bricks in each column. \n\n### By applying the addition rule to 24 and 24, we discover that the total number of brics of snow in the bottom half of the igolo is 51. The top half of the igolo has 40 bricks of snow per column. The total number of bricks in the entire igolo is 50+40, which when divided by 2 gives 10+22 and 11 bricks of ice.

Explain.\n\n### Response (1):Teach students how to solve problems using concrete objects, such as counters, blocks, and number lines.\n\n### Rationale:\nTeaching students how to solve problems through abstract means is a difficult and often frustrating process that can lead to student dissatisfaction. Since children experience the world around them through concrete objects, allowing them to manipulate objects will lead to a much easier understanding of complex math problems. Counters, blocks, and paper-and-pencil manipulatives are all concrete objects that allow students to explore basic math concepts and prepare them for abstract math learning. Using concrete objects allows complex problems to be broken down into smaller, more easily understandable steps. It also provides students with a solid foundation of mathematical understanding that will be extremely helpful as their abstract mathematics learning continues.\n\n### Teaching students how to solve complex questions is a crucial part of preparation before asking them to solve similar problems on their own. One effective method is for teachers to encourage students to work collaboratively. This method gives students the opportunity to discuss the problem with their classmates, learn from each other, and develop their own strategies for solving similar problems.\n\n### Another option is for teachers to incorporate different types of learning activities into their classes. It helps them stay engaged in the process, learn how to apply the concepts they have learned, and understand the concepts of complex problems. Teachers can use both activities in which students learn by doing (for example, using manipulative objects such as blocks or cubes) and those that require critical thinking (such as constructing graphs or using math symbols).\n\n### Teachers can also supplement their teaching methods by incorporating technology into the classroom. For example, instead of simply using worksheets to teach students how to calculate complex problems, they can use software to introduce digital graphics that demonstrate mathematical processes in realistic situations.

{"text": "**Answer choices:**\n1.   A: 45\n2.   B: 12\n3.   C: 28\n4.   D: 10\n\n**Explanation:** This is an arithmetic problem. We know that seven rabbits must be added to make 1/3 of 13. Seven multiplied by 1/3 equals 2, so we know that adding seven rabbits to the cage makes 2 rabbits in the caged area. We can also subtract three from thirteen because we know that this is 2/3 of 1/3 of the original number of rabbits in th cage. So we see that adding seven rabbits and subtracting three rabbits makes 10 rabbits. Therefore, the answer to this problem is ten rabbits saw in the park today because 1/3 of thirteen rabbits is ten.\n\n<details id=\"answer\">\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nWe start by finding a common multiple that will fit with 13 at least three times. We know that seven must be added so we want a common multiple between 13, 13, and 19. Seven would be evenly divisible by 3, so 3x3x3 would be a common multiple between 3, 2, and 1. Therefore, 21 rabbits must be in the cage. So seven rabbits are added and seven rabbits are then subtracted and then we make the answer 10 rabbits in the cages. \n\n13 + (7 + 3), 21 rabbits\n\nThen to make the answer 1/3 of that we take 21 and then divide it by 13 and we get.156 percents.\n\n.156 + 7/.9 = 1.226.\n\nThen we have 28 rabbits in the cag.\n\n7 added 7 taken, 28 rabbits\n\n</details>\n\n### Instructor comment:\n\nThanks!

Let's consider first that there are 1000 Liters in a cubic meter then the space occupied by 960 Liters of water in the 120-Liters tub is of a cube's edge, then the edge of the cube shall be equal to 120/960 of a Cubic meter = 0.12 m\nNow the flow rate of a tap is 12 Liters per minute and he closed the water supply for 3 seconds. So every liter of water takes 3/60 second that is 0.05 sec which is 0.5 second then 0.5sec(12) Liters = 6 Liters of water so he have 6 Liters of outlet and the rate at which outlet is 0.5sec i.e per 1sec/6liters 10/6 liters and to fill one meter he need 10 liters so he fill 8 meters that is 80 liters and in this way the total water he took is 960+80=1040 Liters in 4 min then for how many time the water will be released per min then 1040/12 liters = 86.66 sec then he closed the tap for 1 second and he need to take 8 minutes to fill the whole tank.

{"text": "Consider the classroom with 30 desks: 30 = 15 \u00d7 2 which means that all 15 classes would have 2 students, and each desk would be shared by two students. A school that has 15 classes and 15 of the classrooms are each with 30 desk. In total there are 450 desks in the school. But the answer requires that each desk should only accommodate one student. As stated, we have 450 desk, which can accommodate 450 students. Hence the correct answer is one-third (33%) of the total school population. The next thing to consider is that there are 15 x 2 = 30 classrooms where the desks have 2 students to be shared per desk. In total we have 45 desks with 2 students to be accommodated, then we multiply the factor 2 by 15 classes (30 desk per class for 15 classes x 2 = 60 desks). Now we see that we can accommodate only 60 students with 2 students to share a desk. The total number of desks in the school is 450. The total number of students for 2 students to share one desk is 60.\n\nTotal students who share one desk = (450-45) = 405, which is 100 short of the actual students in the total school.\n\nTo conclude, there are 100 students who are sharing (1+1) desks per student.

By understanding this question, the student can come up with a methodology or approach for figuring out the exact number of tank required to fill the ballons of different sizes that is, 1000 in this case.\n\n\\There are several techniques for solving the question. First, identify the units in use, as it is crucial to calculate the proper units of the quantity to be used in the calculations. In this case, the units are balloon capacity (Liters) as well as the volume of the tank. After identifying the units, it is necessary to break the quantity as it is expressed in the questions into multiple components. By doing so, you can easily solve the question. For example, 500-Liter tank can be easily solved in 500 liters x.01 = 5 liters. Similarly, 100 Liters can be solved in 100 Litres *.1 = 10 Liters. By doing this, you can conclude that 250 bottles of air per liter are required to fill the balloons. Hence, the exact number of tuns required is (1000 baloons*250 Litres)/litres = 250 tuns.\nAnswer: 250 Tuns", "answer": " 20"}

The 18 year - older elephant needs to eat an amount of chocolate equal to the number of days it is given the amount of chocoloate in, plus one day. We can assume that the number of days will remain the same over time. Thus, the elephant, over the course of two days, would eat 32 chocolat in total. Then, you simply multiply 32 by 2 = 64, which is the amount of chocoslate that the elephant will eat over the course of two day.\nAnswer : 64 chocolate\n\n## Input :  If you have 3 chicken eggs, 5 dog eggs, and 17 duck eggs which you use to make an egg stew, the eggs are:\n\n## Demonsteration :\nFirst, we have to add all our eggs.

Since each floor is 26 floors, and for 26 floors we need 53 pounds of stone, we need 3 times that or 169 pounds of sandstone to be able to build 30 floors.\n\nAnswer B: How much sandstone is needed to build a 50 floor building?\n\nDemonration:\n\nNow that we know that a 50 floor requires 169 pounds, we have to remember that we are talking about 30 \"26-floor\" buildings.

So we need 30 * 169 = 5370 pounds.  So we need to repeat that 169 times for each of the 30 stories.\n\nAnswer D:\nAgain, each building is 30 stories and each story needs 169 pounds.

{"text": "To determine how many buildings collapsed, one has to know how many collapsed in each successive earthquake\n```plain\nThe question asks about the collapse of the four buildings. After the first four buildings collapsed, it is then asked about the numbers of buildings that collapsed in each following earthquake. \n```plain\n\nWe must think about how many buildings collapsed initially and the number in subsequent earthquakes. \n```plain \nThe number of buildings that collapsed initially is the number of the first four buildings that collapsed because that is the first earthquake whose result we are concerned about. The expert's prediction is of double that number for a reason; let's find out what that reason is.\n```plain\nWe have three more earthquakes whose result is concerned about. Let's find what this means by asking, \"What is it that changed the number of collapses?\"\n```plain\nThe number of collapses changed because a greater force was placed on it during an earthquake, making it weaker.\n```plain\n\nThe last step is knowing what change occurred with each earthquake after the first and adding the values together.\n```plain\n1. 2 + 4 = 6;\n2. 6 + 12 = 18;\n3. 18 + 24 + 30 = 72\n```plain\nThus, the number of buildings collapsed would be 72. \n\nAnswer: 72 buildings, because of the first four buildings and the three subsequent earthquakes.\n\n\n### Input 1:In one year, the total earnings of a particular company were $16,600,000 and the average cost for each item was 0.80.

He has booked a suite with balcony and breakfast in the morning. If the rate for a suite is 3 times that of a 1-star hotel and has breakfast included in the price, how much is payable for this double room?\n\n### Responses:\n\nThe first step is to determine how much a 1 star hotel is going to cost. So, according to the prompt, double the hotel room is 3 times the 1-star hotel rate. Therefore, the 1-star rate is 1.5/2 times the rate of the 3-star hotel room.\n\nThe second step is to find out how much the breakfast is, by looking at the information given in the prompt, that breakfast is included in the 3-star room rate, so for the entire suite with balcony, the breakfast will be added to the price.\n\nThe third step involves combining these two rates, $50 for the 1-star and $50 for breakfast, to get 90 for the 3-star with balcony and $50 breakfast. So 90 is going to be double this (this rate is mentioned again in the prompt as double this).\n\nThe fourth step involves reducing the number by 1, as the double of that is going to be 1.5 times the price.

{"text": "#### Rationales:\n\n#### Answer 1\n\nInput: The question tells that James planted 60% of the 20-seed plants per tree. Since this percentage is only of the total number of plants in the trees - the seeds in each plant do not come into the calculation. The total number of seeds per plant as well as per tree is, 20 - which cannot be divided by 60% therefore it becomes 3.33333 seeds per plant. So, James planted only 3.33 seeds per tree. Therefore, there were 2x3.333 seeds trees. James had to plant a total number of 8.666 seeds.\n\nRationales: The problem has a lot of errors written all over it, and we can see those from the very first sentence.\nFirstly, the questions asks how many trees he planted while in the response, the answer is total number of seeds he planted.\n\nThe next sentence in the problem states that he has planted 60%. If this percent were to be used to count trees, there would only be 1.2 trees according to the 60% which states in the problem itself that he is doing the calculation for 20-seed.\n\nThirdly, it states that he collects all the fruit from his 2 trees and plants 60% which means that the fruit is an outcome of a tree. If it's only one tree, there would be no fruits.\n\nThe next part of the question asks is the total seeds planted, which is actually not the question that was asked. The response is also not the question that was given in the problem which is, how many trees and planted.\n\n#### Answer 2\n\nInput: To solve this, the logic is that we have to find out the number of trees he planted. First, we will count the number of times 20 is divided by 60 which is 0.333. Therefore, that number of trees is 20 divided by 0.33 is 60.667 and is rounded off to 60 trees.

Andy bought one can of soda that cost $1.  He also bought two hamburgers that each cost $2, for a total of $4.  Bob bought two sandwiches that cost him $3.  He also bought one can of fruit drink that cost him $4.  Thus, A= B = 9:\n\nA = B = 9 -> (A = B) -> 2A = 2B ==> 2A - 2B = 0  ==> A - B = 0  ==> ( A = B) ->  Andy and Bob both spend the same amount.

{"text": "Ian's choice to use the money to first pay off debts and then to make a series of payments means that his expenditures are in increments of 2x, 2x, 1/2x, and 1/2x respectively.  \nThe only way his spending of the money remains the same each round is if each payment, in dollars, is equal to its value's previous payment multiplied by 2 (the first round value was $20, so each subsequent payment should have been $40 more).  Also, his final payment should have been half of the previous, hence half of the final payment.\nFrom this information, we conclude that the answer is $3.50.  The process of elimination rules out a negative or zero answer.\n\n### Input :\nThe final sum of the given series is $37.2. The total value of each subsequent payment must have been $40. It seems that after every payment, Ian pays half of the total $40 payment that came before. Also, the total amount he paid after every 3rd payment was $37.  The next lowest amount he could have paid after the 3rd payment is $37, because he cannot make a payment less than half of what the payment that preceded it was (the 3rd payment in this case). This means that each payment is equal to $37 before any adjustment, so the answer is $37.\n\n### Note :\nInput : A car manufacturer has 2 cars for sale.  One is $15,000 and the other is $22,000.

{"text": "The first step is to determine the variables in the problem.\nThe variables are copper ions and beakers, number of beakers, number of drops of a solution, number of tests, and the number of copper ions.\nYou can determine the number of copper beakers by subtracting the number of beakers without copper by the number of tests.\nNext, you can determine the number of drops of the solution by adding the number of tests with the number of drops.\n\nNumber of copper beakers = number of beakers - number of copper  beakers.\nNumber of drops = number of tests + number of drops. \n\nYou can use the above equations to answer your question.\n\nThe number of copper 1ions in the beakers = 22 - 8.\nThus, the number of beakers has 14 copper ions. So, to find the variables, you will need to test 14 times in order to see if there is some in each of the 14 beakers.\nThe number of drops for 14 times = 45 + 14.\nNumber of beakers with copper =14. \nNext, answer the following questions:\n\n\nHow many beakers without coppers will have to be tested to find 8 without copper\n\n1. Number of drops of the solvent = 45, which means you have to drop it 5 times onto the beakers with coppers and once more on the beakers without copper to be sure that no copper is going to be found. Also, test 4 times for the drops of solution.\n\nHow many beaker do you end up testing\n\n1. You have to test 15 times. 8 times with positive copper and 7 times for testing the beakers without cooper.

{"text": "It costs $65 to get enough flour to make 12 loaves.\n\n### Rationales\n1. For a one-step, additive problem, you might use the following three-step problem-solving process to determine the solution:\n\n  1. Specify which operations are involved in the problem.\n\n  2. Find each number in the operation.\n\n  3. Add up all the numbers.\n\nIn the above example, the operations are addition. The numbers are the units' cost and the amounts. \n\n2. To answer the above question, you need to work out the following three steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Specify which operation is involved in the problem. \n\nTo specify the operation, break the problem down into smaller \"atomic\" units. In this case, the atomic units are each type of flour and the units of measure is dollars. The operation is addition, as you only have flour as the addends (the numbers before addition). \n\n#### Step 2: Find each number in the problem. \t\t\t\n\tSince the operation is addition, each value on the right side of the equation is the addends. In this case, we have four addends: 4 and 10 (indicating 4 pounds of a 10-pounds bag of flour) for three times, or the first time and the second time, representing two bags (indicating two bags of flour.) This gives you a total of 12 addends, or numbers. In addition, multiply the cost by the number of pounds for each type of flour used. \n\n#### Step  3: Add up all the numbers in the problem. 12 * 4 + 13 * 10 = 65 \n\nAdding 12*4 (indicating the first time flour is being used) and 13 * 2 (indicating the second time flour is being added), gives a total of 65. \n\n### Inputs:Directions:\n\n#### 1.

Choices: \n  A: 2 B: 4 C: 5 D: 7 E: 8 F: 12\nRationales: The first question to ask is not which quantity is needed but why it is needed. In this case, the context of the problem is the number of cups Sarah needs for her party. The fact that the choices are organized into pairs of equal quantities helps identify what she needs.\n\nNow, as a logical deduction, if you take the pairs of two cups that have the same quantity, what you have left is a number of cups that are not part of those pairs. Those would be pairs of 3 cups, 6 cups and 8 cups. Since any pairing of cups results in a lower quantity than what is needed, she needs to purchase cups beyond the pairing.\n\nTaking all these together, it is certain that Sarah needs more than 2 cups. Based on the above reasoning, she needs more cups than 2, 4, and 5. So the answer is D: 7. Sarah needs to buy", "answer": " 1210"}

Then, explain why the answer is 2 and not 2/10.\n\n### Solution:The answer is 2/3.  \nI explained to the fourth grader in the following way:\nThe numerator in the fraction is three, because we subtract to get to 1. The denominator is 9. This number means division in math. So we divide to get 3. The answer is one half. We can just say it is two thirds because we did that math before the division.\n\nThe answer is two because adding the whole number three, you get 5.\n\nI can explain why it is not 2/12.

The time spent doing this task is 4 hours.\n\n### Rationale:\n-Graph: It is a good idea in this case to use a graph (Venn diagram);\n-Overlap: The area of overlap represents the amount of time spent on making 3 pizzata;\n-Solution: One hour of dough-making results in 20 hours of cooking, and a potential for one additional pizza to be made (areas of overlap). The amount of time spent on this task is 4;\n-Calculation: There are 30 minutes in an hour.\n20/30 of pizza dough, or the area of overlap, is therefore 2 hours.

Thus, I am not considering a specific room in which they spent extra time on. \n\nBecause I don't know if it is a 2, 3, 4, or 5 bedroom house that Tom is renovating, I do not know what percent the living room is of the house, or other information about the house.\n\nI don't use any of the given percentage information because it is not included in the information given in the question.\n\n## Response:\n```\nTom spent 84h\n```\n\n### Input2:How many hours does everything take when there are 4 bedrooms and each takes 6 hours to renovate the kitchen?\n\n### Reponse:\n```\nThe answer is \"It doesn't matter\", because there is no information that the kitchen takes longer when the number of bedrooms is a certain number.

{"text": "Input: Arlene hiked for 6 hours, her elevation was 5 feet tall, and the temperature was 60 degrees.\nRationales: The question asks the reader to calculate the average hiking pace for Arlene considering all the information given.\nSince it's not specified when the hike or how long exactly it lasts, here's your best guess:\n1. Given that Arlene hiking for 6 hours, then her average hiking pace would (6/24), or 0.25 miles/hour.\n2. Arlene hikers an average of 0.25 mph, which means it took her 16 hours to cover 24 miles. In other words, it tooks her 8 hours more to cover the 24 mile. \n3. Since she is 5 feet tall, her legs are 1.8 m tall and 2.5 feet long and 1.8 * 60 miles conversion to inches = 108 inches. Dividing the number of hours it took to cover the 21 miles by the total length of her legs in inches, the average rate is 1.216334 millimeters/second.\n4. The unit that is provided is miles per hour while what the question asked for is the average hiking rate per second. But since the question is specific, we need to convert the average hiking per second rate into miles per hour. So, divide 108 by 3,600: \n\n1. Divide 108 by the number of hours it typically takes to cover 24 mile and get 0.79 miles per hour as the average hike per seconds.\n\n2. Then divide 0.79 by 3600 (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) to get 11.98 mph as the average hiking speed.\n\nTherefore the answer is 11.99 mph average hiking rate.\n\nAnswer: 11.9 mph", "answer": " 4"}

But it is unlikely that the answer will be this close. We know that the total amount sold cannot be $25 or $24. Since the water bottles can only sell for $1.85, we know that choosing C or D will not work since $25 or $36 is not in between 1.85.\n\nChoosing choice A and B as a range, if B goes first, the total amount of money in the end can only be $2.

{"text": "Input: The first step is determining the distance from Velma's flash light to Veronica's.  The choices for the distance from the light indicate that distance is in feet.  (0.30, 1.20, -0.99) are close and negative; therefore, the light was very far.  (1497, 1441, 1486) are the best choice.  It is known that the flash light's light is bright enough to be seen from a distance of 900 feet.  Since we are asked about the distance from Velma, we are subtracting the distance from Veronica and the light, which gives -15 (915 = 0.09) feet.\n\nInput: The second step is determining the angle between Veronica's and Freddie's light.  The angle between -55\u00b0 and -89\u00b0 is best (90.0).\n\nInput: The next step is determining the minimum distance between Freddie's -90.0\u00b0 and Velma's -90\u00b0.  It is necessary to subtract the radius of each flashlight from the angle and sum the result.  (Because Velma turned off her light, we need to subtract 0.99\u00b0, but Freddie's is not close enough to Velma's to subtract 0.30\u00b0).  (1441 - 0.99 = 1360 - 0.9 )  The next step must be determined by subtracting the distance from each flashlight.  \nThe distance from Freddie's light is -55\u00b0 and the distance from Velma is 1486.  That means 1486 - 1360 = 126 and 1441 -126 = 1315.  This number becomes the minimum difference between angles.  Now we need to add from the minimum difference a value of 2000 from the given. It would be very far, but it is the minimum distance in given solution; therefore  this is the best solution.\n\nThe final task for Velma is to subtract 1486 from 1486 + 2000.  The new value becomes 214.", "answer": " 12,000"}
{"text": "32\n\nInput: What is the value of x+y? Choices:  [x, 4] [y, 4] [x+y, 0] [x, 4+y]\nRationales:\n\nThere are three possible values of x and y for x+y. 0 is not even a potential solution since there cannot be a subtraction in the equation to start with, hence the answer must be one of the other three choices. \n\nUsing the number line, you see that x+y is equivalent to x+4.

Hence, what you need is $64 minus $20 to make up the amount.\n\nAs for coming up with your own contribution of say $20, her answer to you will be $20 + 20 = 40, which is the total of the contribution you will make.\n\nThen, $64 minus $40, or simply 24 is what you will finally add to your own contribution to buy the cake.\n\n### Inputs:\n\n1.

When you buy $10 worth of notepads, they would contain the number of pages specified. 204 pages x $1.25 = $25.98.\n2. So, 25.98 divided by $10 = 2.598. This means that there are 2.59 notepads per $10.\n3. In the same way, for the pencils, assuming each pack had 1 box of pencils. 60 pieces (cumulative) per case x 40 pencils per case, so 60 x 40 = 2400.\n4. This would mean in 4 cases of 2400, you have 24,000 in total.\n5. Therefore, there are 6000 pencils in 4 cases.\n6. Therefore 4 x 6000 = 24,040 pencils in one case.\n7. So 24,052 pencils were in the case bought.\n8. Therefore after you buy 108,040 pendants, you should have 14,528 pencils in one box.\n9.

It is obvious the teacher can not buy a different bag than requested (11 of 25 wanted the vampire bag, and 14 of 25 wanted pumpkin bag), but she can buy individual bag or 5-pack.\n\nIf we buy individual bags, as the price of a single bag is $1, then the total amount we spend is $1 multiplied times the number of individual bags bought.  So we can say $1N.  The total amount to spend is $1N.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the amount if we go for the 5-packs.  If the teacher needs to buy 5 individual bags of a certain theme, then the price is $3*5. This is for one group of theme, hence the number of total group is 2, hence the total cost for getting the 5-pack is $10.  The minimum amount needed for purchasing the bag is $5.

How many printers do they have, for example, if they can print 6,000,000 pages in 20 minutes.\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer is the letter A.\n\n### Answer Justification\n\nThey have one printer because if it were 600 more per minute, each printer would have to print 600 pages, or two in one minute. They do not have any printers that are able to print at 600 pages in one minute because there are only 600 printers. This information was obtained from the 6,00,00,0,00, which was the answer.

The class raised $128 and each student contributed $5.\n\n  Next, note the total amount raised, which is $128.\n\n  There are 20 schoolchildren who were asked to pay $7 each, thus, 128 - 20 = 108 is the total each student raised and the final amount is then $108. Next apply $5 to each student and $108 for all students.\n\n  $108 + $5 for each student = $120\n\n\n  $120 X 20 = $2400\n  This is the total field trip cost of $2400.

How much money does her grandparents give her?\" Betty does not have any money from her parents since it would leave her with $175 and still need $25 to buy the wallet (175 + 30 + 15 =120 dollars which is more than $100, so she needs $25). \n\nIt could be argued that Betty doesn't need any of her own money to buy the wallet because her parents will give her what she needs. However, the question is solely about her grandparents and mentions multiple times that it is her grandparents that are donating her $25.\n\n### Input 1: A person, A, who is not familiar with cryptocurrencies asked B, a crypto enthusiast, if they could buy BTC through a third-party exchange that only provides Bitcoin options.

The answer is 24, so he can eat 24 slices.\n\n### Because we learned that he buys two large and two small pizzas, he can eat only 24 slices,\n### and if you combine them together, you can get 32, but we are looking for the smallest amount of equal number.\n\n### In the image above, you noticed that he can eat a total of 32 (2 large pizza + 2 small pizza)\n\n### But since a pepperoni pizza has 1/4 of pepperoni on it, a pizza slice should have the same amount. So there would be only 16 pepperoni slices. (16 pepperoni small pizza + 16 pepperone large pizza = 32 pepperoni slices) So the number 24 slices is not a smallest amount of equal number and it must be less.\n\n### So what number is smaller than **24**?

Input: You have 3 cans. 4 people want to eat 3 pounds of ham. How much ham is left over?\nRationales: The question requires calculating the amount of ham left over once 3 pounds have been divided among 4 people.\n\nIt is known that each person is able to eat a pound of ham. So, 4 pounds of ham can be divided evenly among 4 people, resulting in 1 pound of ham per person.\n\nHowever, there are not 4 cans in the group, so the problem cannot be solved equally, which means if each person eats 1 pound of the ham, it would still be 1 pound per person.\n\nThis leaves 3 pounds of ham left in the 3 cans that, collectively, equal 12 pounds of ham.\n\nTherefore 12 - 1 = 11 pounds of ham is left over. This means each person has a pound to eat and there are 11 pounds left over to be shared among themselves.\nIf each person is given this remaining 11 pounds of meat, they all get 1 pound.\n\n### Input.You have 3 cans of soda. 4 people want 3 pounds of ham for lunch.

Choices: 200, 220, 221\nRationales:Here we are asked to find out how much Jerome will ride on the 14th day to reach his end goal.\n-Option1 is not correct as he is only ridding 12 miles a day at most on a 12 day trip with a 200 mile goal, and the trip has 14 days.\n-Option 2 has 220 miles, we subtract from the goal 200 and get to 20, then divided by 12 to get 16. But 16 is not an integer when we add this with the 12 miles already ridden.\n-Option 3 is the correct answer as it has 221 miles ridden and adds the 12 miles he has already traveled with the goal, which gives us 233 miles total ridden. When we divide 233 by 12 we get 19.3 miles and round it to the nearest integer, which gives us 19 miles. \n-So option 3 is the correct choice.\nAnswer: 19 Miles.\n\n### Input The old ladies pet cat slept 8 hours on the 13 hour drive.

{"text": "#### The first thing to do with this question is to determine the total number of boys in a family. \n\nYou can use the given ratio and how many there are of girls in the family to calculate that.\n\nThe total number of children in a family of 5:7 is 20. 20 divided by 7 will give us 2.85. Subtracting 1 from 2.85 gives us 1.85. As we don't have the exact number of children it is impossible to determine which boy gets how much. \n\nWhat we can do then  is determine the amount of money each boy will get individually.\nThe number of boys in a ratio of 5:7 in 20 is equal to 12. You can remember that by writing 3x2=6 or 10.6. We know the total amount of money each boy can get, in this case, $3900. Which is equal to 8x2=16.

{"text": "Nate had to walk through the parking lot in either Section G or Section H. According to the question, he walked through every row in each section of the lot. Since he found the car in the airport lot, we know he walked through the entire lot to the car.  \nWhen he started in one section and finished the car in another section, that means he took a detour. Whenever there is a detour, it would take him the same amount of time as the full route. Let\u2019s say that it took him 15 minutes to find the car. Then in order to count the detour time, we take the total time spent, 15 minutes, and divide it by the speed, the time spent walking through 11 cars a minute. Then divide it by how many cars Nate walked past, 11, and you get 110 minutes. The detour time taken up was 100 minutes. Now we subtract the detour time which took Nate in either, section G or section H. Section G and section H are next to each other, which means that he does not need to take the detour if he were to go across to the other end.\n\n### Input : The first equation is x^2 - 64 = 8x + 4.

{"text": "The question is asking about the number of books in the classroom.\n\n#### Answer Parts\nThe first step is to determine which number of books is 7 books, because the teacher had only 10 children who had the same number of books.\n\n```\nSince the teacher has 10 children, there should be 70 books + the 8 extra books = 78 books.\n```\n\nTherefore, 7 books in the children's classroom means the number of books in a classroom that has 10 children is 78 books. Hence, using the strategy of elimination, the most likely answer is B.\n\n### Rationales\n1. All choices are related to the number of books in all children's classrooms.\n2. Option B, 75 books, contains an extra 7 books beyond the total number of books given.\n3. Option A, 70 books, adds fewer books and would be possible only if the teacher did not bring any extra books.\n4. Option C, 85 books, includes more books than the given total.\n5. The possibility of the numbers being reversed between options A and B is eliminated. 6. The possibility of the number in option B being more or less than 63 is eliminated. Thus, the number in option B would have to either be 70 or 78.\n7. Since both values fit the given conditions and can be easily calculated, we can use any of them. However, the number we used in the calculation is option B, and since option B is the only answer option that has no error, option B would be the correct answer.\n\n### Choices and Rationales:", "answer": " 78"}

From this, we see that 1 centimeter can be equated to100 millimeters (1 millimeter = 1000 milliMeters). There are therefore 100 millimters in 1 centimeter and 10 millimeters in", "answer": " 25"}

The 25 years between his birth and death.\n\t\nShakespeare died on April 23, 1616.\n\nWe know that Shakespeare was born in April. \nThis means that his birth date would most likely be in the same month as his death.\n\nShakespeare died 25 years before his death means that he lived exactly 25 years.\n\n4.

So, when given specifics about this task, the first task is to determine how many more questions will be required for completion. Given that she answers 16 of 80 questions with 12 minutes, she has answered 16/80= 0.2 times, or 1/5 times, of the whole test.\n\nThis means she needs to answer (80-16=) 64/64 of the test, or 64 questions.\n\nThe second part of the question asks about how much time was used, which gives us the current time used to finish 16 questions, which is 12 minutes.\n\nIf we add minutes to get totals, the total time, 12 + 0.2 + 3, becomes 24.4 minutes, and Jessica needs to answer 15 questions to finish the exam in one hour and 48.4 minutes.\n\nThe last part of the question asks for leftover minutes or her remaining seconds, which can be determined from her current rate or her rate with adjusted time.\n\nThe current rate will show 72 minutes for a total of 80 questions answered.

The return trip is 20 miles. Then he needs to account for his out trip and the first stop, which is 5 miles.  The remainder is 15.  \nTony's out trip will add to the return trip.  After the stop, his out trip is (10*[5-5]/10-5-5)] + 5, which equals 5.\n\nThe formula you arrived at was, ([distance of trip] x [return distance of trip] / [return trip distance]) - (distance from trip start point - distance to first stop and return trip distance)\n\nAs a final answer, use your formula to answer the question.  \nThe distance to your first stop is 5, as shown above.

We can first understand the yearly savings graph to understand her savings in december. \n\n* First, we can notice that her monthly income is at zero every month and then she saves this amount or at least a certain percentage of her monthy income. \n* Based on this we can draw a few conclusions from the graph and the following line of questioning: \n\n* *Why $15 in the year but $10 per month?* She must be saving a sum larger than her monthly income and she saves a certain percentage every month.\n* *What does $15 represent?* $15 is what she saves every month, so we would expect to get that sum by the year. \n* *How many months are there?* At the beginning, she saves $10 per month which would be 12 months, but at the end we see $15 so we see the graph goes till 13 months.\n\n\nWe can find that she saves a total of $180 so far. \n\n* *What happened in month 13?* Month 13 is when she saves $15 but we know that this is not the last month so we are left with the question \"what saved in november?\". \n\nThe amount we see saved in November is $150 which we can assume she saved this amount as a sum in one time.\n\nWe can also see that she saved $150 with the income she earns and she saved a percentage of it. \n\n* What was she earning every month?* We can get a rough estimate from the monthly income graph and assuming that she earned $720 in her whole month. \n\nWe can get that she would save $15 * $720 * ((12) $10/$720 = $192). \n\n* What would be the total if she saves $192 in month 13 and $192 in that month?* We can also see that in months 1 and 2 she saves $150 and since the amount she saves from Nov is not enough we can look at how much she saved in month 2 and she saved $300", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "Jose has a total of 2400 imported wine bottles and 1200 domestic wine bottles in his private cellar.\n\nInput:If a bottle of imported  wine and a bottle of domestic wine are opened at the same time, then the bottle of imported wine is the larger of the two, by at least 19%. If Jose's guests only take one-third of all wine from his cellar, they will consume 450 imported wine bottles\nand 900 domestic wine bottle, in total.\n\n###  Rationales:\n1. Jose's guests should drink 1/3 of the wine available at his party.\n2. Jose's cellar holds a total of 2600 bottles:\n2400 imported and 1209 domestic, making 450+ the imported wine consumed and,\n900 + the domestic wine.\n\n3. For each label, (1st column) is the number of bottles of imported wine, and (2nd column) is the number\nof all bottles. And by subtracting the imported wine from all of the wine, it comes to a total of 236.\n3. Total remaining imported wine, 2400-236=2364.\n4. In the above example, the imported bottle is the bigger bottle of the two.\n5. In the example, both imports and domestic wine account for 2/3rd of the total wine, which makes it a 2/3rd,\nbut when adding, it's 9/13.\n6. If one takes 1/3 of each then it'll make up only 1/3rd and not 1/2.\n7. So the answer is 2364.", "answer": " 2400"}

It requires the use of two fractions with common denominator.

To calculate how many cups you need, you can use the fraction model which is (8/7)*16 GB or 4 GB.

{"text": "A plumber was deciding which of three jobs to take to make most profit. \n\nIn the first job, he would fix three toilets and have 3 showers. \n\nThe second job, he would fix two toilets and fix 5 sinks. \n\nIn third job, he would fix one toilet, 2 showers and 3 sinks.\n\nLet, the total profit be represented as p = A + B + C\n\nFrom Job 1 - Total profit for first job = ($30*3) + ($40*3) +($50*3) = 1350 + 120 + 150 = 1620\n\nFrom Job 2 - Total profit for second job, = ($30*2) + ($40*(5) + ($50*2) =  600 + 220 + 50 = 1320\n\nFrom job 3 =\n($30*1) + ($40 * 2) + ($50 * 3) = $ 300 + 80 + 15 = 1255\n\nLet total profit = P = Min(A,B)\n\nThen - A < B < C\n\np = A + B +C = Min(A, B) + C = Min (p, C) So, P = Min (A, B) = 162, 1222 and 1255 is the minimum of choice, so choice 3 job will give the max profit (1222-1255). Total profit = 162 + 233 + 1255 = 1621\n\nAnswer: 1621 (The plumbing job that the plumber needs to take to make the most profit is job 2 for the third apartment complex. This is because it involves fixing two toilets and fixing five sinks.  Because the plumber charges $40 to fix two sinks and $50 to have three sinks, he can make $233 in total profit for fixing the two sinks. He can then make $1255 in total profit for having five sinks. He can therefore make a total of $162", "answer": " 250"}

So he has still $96.5 dollars.\n- He purchases twice as many bottles that he had: 24 bottles of water for 96.5 $.\n- Then he purchases 1 bottles of cheese and he only has 50 dollars.\n- So he has bought 2 bottles of water for $96.5 - $10 = 86.5 dollars.

He looks for ropes that are more than 18 feet long but did not find any. So for now, he chooses a 4- feet long rope and three 1-foot long ropes which makes it become 6 and 3 feet long respectively because each foot they added made them lose an inch because it was a 1-foot long.

This means that it happens every year and the numbers of days in March are always the same. \n\nWe can determine that there are four weeks; as, for a typical month, there are 4 weeks.\n\nThis is important to note because it informs our calculation of how many times the numbers are divided among 4 weeks.\nIn other words: we know the week-to-days-ratio for the entire month (i.e, 4 weeks/6 days, or about 1.66; for every six whole days there\u2019s a 1 day break).\n\nThis ratio is an important clue to determine how many times these numbers are divided among four weeks: in other words, we can ask how many days the numbers (Susa and Camden) are divided among six whole days.  \n\n### So basically, if we divide March (16 + 7) /6 = number of days Susanna went divided by 4 weeks, we get 4.541.\n\n### If every week were divided exactly (4.541) of the time, then Susannah would go 4.54 times more than in every week. \n\n### However, 4 weeks and 4.54 is not an exact multiple of (80 = 24 + 16)\n\n### Therefore, Susannah went about 7.8 more times per week", "answer": " 2"}

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band? Choices:  Year: 1961 1962 1964 1965 1966\nRationales:\n\nThe first thing to understand is which Beatles album this question refers to. One way to do so is to eliminate options that are not the first album. Sgt. Pepper, released in 1967, is obviously not the first album. 1965 is not even the band's first album named after one of its songs, because Yesterday's and Today was not the first; it was actually the fourth album. 1957 and 1958 were early years even the Beatles were not formed, so those are excluded.\n\nAs we narrow the options, we can quickly eliminate 1955, 1959, 1960, and 1963 because, except for 1963, each is less than two years from the year the Beatles were established.\n\nIt now remains to eliminate the three years which are the same as 1963. This eliminates 1961, 1962, and 1932 (year the Beatles were formed). Now it's all about 1964 and 1965.\n\nWe know the album is the fourth album, and its name is Sgt. Pepper. As such, the song it was named after, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts club band, was actually an instrumental, not a vocal song with lyrics. Therefore, the song was not recorded until 1967. \n\nFrom all these pieces of information, the conclusion is that \"Sgt. Pepper' was the album released in 1977. Therefore, the answer to the question is 1962.\n\nAnswer: 1962", "answer": " 40"}

Hence this can be written as (a quantity) + ( another quantity) + (one last quantity) or as (3x +2) where x is the number of individuals required for the task\n\nStep 3 - Finally, the next step is to use the formula (3x +2 = total individuals required to feed).\n\nTo  find out how many pack's of trail mix does Roger needs after he's deducted the 3 required for feeding the coach and the two required for feeding the helper \n\n(3x +2) - (3+2)= 15 individuals left to feed. Thus we have , hence the number of packs required (x) = 15/6 = 2.5\n\nNow, since 1 pack of trail mix is consisted 6 individual pouch's, we  need to divide 2.5 by 6, we get an answer to 8.25.

The question is not concerned about his previous weight. The only time period that matters is how many months before the combat, not past or beyond that point in time. After four months of a special diet, the answer to the minimum weight of the day of the combat is \"88 kg\" since the answer will be 97/3 = 32.33. The next month he will be 97-3 = 94Kg.

(first answer) 26 students are in the class because \"3 quarters are in the classroom and 1/10 absent so, we multiply `3` and `4`, so we can get `12` and the answer we subtract it and put it as `10`. `12` -> `12 - 10 = 2`.\n\nAfter the task i realize that i made a mistake, so: `4 * 3`\n\n2. (second answer) 12 students are in the canteens because there is already the problem here, that we divide with `3` instead of `4`, so: `12 / 4`, then we multiply with `4 / 3` and get 11.25, so `round it` to 12.\n\n### (output 2) - Classroom `A` and Canteen `B`", "answer": " 9"}

Choices :- A:- Seven  B:- 53  C:- 18  D:- 23 Rationales :- 1. In order solve this problem, we take away the three and get seven 2. Next, we add two to the result of seven to get 9 3. Next, we subract six from 9 and get three 4. Again, we add two to this total, in order to get the original question. Thus, the solution is 6 (which is two less than twenty)", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "First, we want to add all of the values from the input, which are the amounts needed to run each type of wash cycle. There are 20 gallons for a heavy wash cycle, 10 gallon for a regular wash cycle, and 2 gallon for a light wash cycle. The numbers are 20 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 34 gallons per load. However, we are told that each load needs to include two heavy washes, four regular washes, and two light washes. There are 2 heavy washes, and 4 regular washes are needed per load, but there are also 2 light washes needed.\n\nThe number of light washes that are needed for each load is 2. However, we know that there are only two light wash cycle choices available. This means that this will result in some overlaps. There are two light wash options, so one will be used each time to complete a set of regular wash and heavy wash cycles. This means that we don't add the two light washes needed in the last load because they would be redundant.\n\nEach type of cycle comes with an extra cycle. This means that the one light wash cycle for each load will be used on the other cycles to remove extra laundry. However, since this comes with 2 light wash cycles, it means that we only need 2 gallons for a light wash to be able to add up everything. When both light wash cycle options have been used on the regular washes and heavy washes available for a cycle, the process is repeated on the next cycle.\n\nFor the washes that are not being bleached, 34 gallons of water are needed for each load. However, the two extra light washes that come with the regular washes and the heavy washes each make use of 2 gallons of extra water.\n\nAfter this has been accounted for, the total amount of water needed for each cycle is 34 * 3 - 2 = 70 gallons.\n\n### Input and output:What is the total number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies required for 64 coins total\n\n### Response and Rationale:\nFirst, we need to know the value of each coin.

{"text": "You've been asked a math problem from a friend and are confused by the wording because the question is missing a subject.\n\nWhile there is an opening statement that mentions 1000 'feet of cable' and its split into 25-feet sections, the question refers to 'that' or 'it' and doesn't mention a subject.\n\nTherefore it's unclear what the problem asks about, so instead of giving an answer to the question as asked, make a suggestion to the problem or point out what is missing. \n\nAnswer: It seems that the number 1000 refers to the total length of cable and the 25-foot mentions the length of each piece of the cable.\nAnswer: The opening statements don't provide the subject, so instead suggest adding the subject by saying:\n```\nIn what number of units does Jan have 1000 cable?\n```\n\n### Input : Jan buys 10 rolls of tape.  There are 6 inches in each roll.  She uses 1 inch from each roll.

Choices: 1: The value of total number of eggs they all collected 2: the value of number of eggs that Tank gathered 3: the value of number eggs that he was missing 4: the value of time that Tank spent 5: the value of number Easter eggs Emma were missing\nRationales: There are two quantities that are unknown and needed to be solved for to determine the total number of eggs that the six people collected. The problem is a little complicated as there are many possible pathways and number of combinations that need to be taken into consideration when solving for the missing part of the answer. The number of eggs collected by the six people involved include the number of eggs that were collected in the first and second rounds by Tank and Emma alone on the first round of egg hut, the number of eggs Tank collected in the second round, and finally the number of eggs that everyone collected in the second round. To solve the problem, the variables need to be identified first, and the two unknowns in the problem are:\n\n- The total number of eggs collected by all the six people\n\n- The number of eggs that Tanks collected\n\nOnce all the unknowns have been determined, the solution can be determined.\n\n#### Solution:\n\nFor the total number of eggs, there is a formula to calculate it using the known values as shown below:\n\n$400 +(Tank's \\text{missing number}) +(10 + (2x)(Tank's \\ text{missing number}\\text{value})) =(6 +(10 +2x(60\\text{ value})))   \\,\\text{or}$   $(400+10+(2x(60))\\text{ value})- (6 +10)=(400 +(10+(2x60)+?)) \\\\\n((?)+10-15)= (400+(10+20)+?)/15= (400 +30+(?))/20   $400 +70+(?))/$20$\n\nFrom here, the unknown value of the number of eggs that Tanka collected can be eliminated because that value is simply obtained by taking the value of $70-\\frac{20}{2", "answer": " 220"}

To answer the question, consider two important factors: First, we're asked how much we spend, so we need to think about how many items we purchase.\n2. Second, we're purchasing items for an event, so this means we're considering the cost of each item. (These two points have been clearly mentioned in the question.)\n\n3.

The tenant never sees the right entrance.\n\nRationales: A.\n\nThe tenant enters the apartment from the left entrance.\n\nThe tenants who enters from the left entrance pay $600 a month.\n\nHence, the tenants who enter from the left entrance pay 1/2 of the monthly cost.\n\nB.\n\nThe tenancy pays $700 a month. This only applies to the tenancy who enters from the left door.\n\nHence the tenant who enters from the left, or right door pay $600.\n\nC.\n\nThe tenency pays $600 a  month.\n\nHuman nature makes it improbable for there to be such an expensive door.\n\nTherefore the tenancy who enters  from the right entrance only pays $600. \n\nD.

{"text": "8 - that is the answer.\n\n### Explanation: \nThis problem is basically about a situation in which the two friends want to divide the doughnuts equally. Since we are looking for the output, our main task is to solve the problem and find the answer. The only condition that we should follow in solving the given problem is that the operation done must not be more than the operator. The input in this case was given from the initial portion of the question. Here the two inputs are the values of the two people who bought doughnuts.\nThereafter, we were told that they planned to share the doughtnuts equally. The condition that we need to keep at hand here in order to solve the problem is that the number of shares given to every person should not be more than the total number of doughnuts. This can also be defined as the total number of doughtnuts and every person's share given.\nThus, the output given in this question should be the number of doughnouts that should be given to each of the people. This means that this value should not be more than 36\nIf we do the addition of all the 8 values, we end up with a number of 36 so the answer is 8.\n### Concept: \nConcepts that must be understood in this question are: division, shares, addition\n\n### Sample output:\n1. One dozendoughnut = 3 = 2 dozen doughnut = 24\n2. One dozendoughtnut = 3 = Samuel\u2019s share = 48\n3. One 12doughnut = 25 = Cathy\u2019s share= 75\n4. Samuel's number of doughtnouts = 24 = His share = 1\n5. The number of doughnus per person = 4\nTherefore, The dozendoughnuts left over after sharing is 3 (difference between the number of dozendoughnut and each of the other person\u2019s share)\nHis share = 48, 4 of his share = 12 and the 1 remaining will be shared by the other 7 people.\n### Rationale:\nThe rationale is in the last 2 questions.

{"text": "The boats have some fixed requirements on their length. Firstly, consider the minimum distance between each boat. We use 2 feet as an example and call the distance d. Hence, the following relation applies: \n\n```math\n\nd >= 2 feet\n\n```\n\nSecondly, we need to account for the minimum distance between a boat and the riverbank which is 1 foot. As an example, if the river is 7 feet wide, we apply this condition to obtain the following restriction:  \n\n```math\nd \\geq2\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\n=d \\geq3.5\n```\n\nNow, we can see that the equation above is satisfied for all `d` less or equal to two feet. In other words, we will have a solution for `d = 0,2, 3,4,5,6`. We notice something though. The `d` on the right side is a small one because the `7` in the denominator is so big that we end up having 3.5 very tiny values `d` (or, the answer is `d= 0.0035, 0.007, 0.0105, 0.145, 0.2905` ). To solve this problem, we need to multiply one side of the equation by a very big number and one side by a very small number. In other words, something like `a \\gg 1` and `b\\ll 1` need to be applied to this equation. One way to do that is to multiply the left side by 900 and the right by 0.01. This way the right hand side goes from 3.5 to 3.5 and the left hand side goes from `0.55`. Hence, the equation now is: `900d\\geq55d`. The right hand side is still not satisfactory because 3.5 is still there and is very small comparing to `900d`. This time, we multiply the left hand side by 1000000 and the right hand side, similarly becomes 35000: `10000xd>35000xd`. The left hand side is now `1000xxd=10000d", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "Input: Jim buys a package of car washes. \nThe answer is 46 dollars, or 20 carwashes x 60% = 12 carwashes, which equals 12 x 15 dollars = 180 dollars, which gets you 180 divided by 20 = 9 dollars. Therefore, because Jim  only have to pay for 60% the price of the carwash package is: 0.6 x 9 dollars = 5.4 dollars, which multiplied by 20 equals 108 dollars. The answer is 108 dollars which multiplied by 0.60 gives you 64 dollars. Therefore the cost of the package is 64 +5.4 = 67.6.\n\n### Solution\n\n* Input: Jim buys a pack of car washes\n* The only piece of information we have is that he buys a package. \n\n* The problem tells us that since he bought a package for that pack the total should have been 60%. So we first need to find the total price of the package. \n\nNow the first thing to consider is that each car wash costs 15 dollars normally. However that is a normal rate and not his rate. \n\nWe have to convert the 15 dollars into percent so it is easier to work out. We then have to convert 12 60% into a dollar value since 1 60% is the cost. \n\nAs a result we know that the package is 75% of the total cost. That is why he can only pay 60% of the package. We also get that 100% minus 60%. \n\nWe convert that cost into a dollar value so we know how much he is paying. \n\nWe find out that he pays 60% of 75%, which is 45%. That should then be multiplied by the whole package. So we multiply 60% by 75% and we get 45%. \n\nNow we multiply 45% by the whole package. The total amount he pays is 45% x the whole package.\n\nHence we get that he pays 45% of the whole package.\nThat means", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": "A man is returning from work trying to decide which route option to take. His first route option includes three stoplights. This route takes him 10 minutes when all three lights are green and each light that is red adds 3 minutes to trip.\n\n### Next Consideration:\nAnalyze what the student should do next to complete the task.\n\n### Answer: A man is returning from work and trying to determine which route option to take to get home.  His first route involves the road that involves 3 stoplights (traffic signals).  This route takes him 30 minutes if all 3 stop lights are green, but if any of the 3 lights are red he gets caught at a stoplight for an additional 30 minutes.  Another option is the shorter, direct route option that does not involve any stoplights and will take him 14 minutes.\nIn this scenario, a man is deciding on whether or not he chooses the route that has 3 stoplights or the shorter route that does not have any stoplights.  Given that all of them stoplights are red, the first route option will be 60 minutes long.\nNext, if one of them stops lights is green, the man still must consider the stoplight time for the next light: He still must consider that he's still going 3 lights, and those lights all involve the same time consideration, therefore 30 minutes.\n\n### Evaluate: How effectively does the student complete the task?\n\n### Reason:\nIs it complete?\n- The student is able to describe the task and the steps in a successful and clear manner.\n\nIs there evidence of prior knowledge and transferable skills?\n- The student accurately uses logical reasoning and relevant math to explain what the task entails and the correct answer.\n\nIs the answer appropriate given the contextual cues?\n- The student offers a correct response.\n\n### Assessments:\nBased on the instructions and responses, how well is a student mastering this standard?\n- A student will be mastering any standard from one that is below the level to any standard from 1.0 level to mastery.\n\nIf this student is identified to be a below-level performer, what additional support is needed to improve proficiency?\n- A student needs to understand the task and is able", "answer": " 5"}

Based on this information, James needs to average above 30 points. The point system is as follows\n\nThe first game we scored 30, the second game we scored 28, the third game we scored 32, the fourth game we scored 34 and the fifth game was not included. James's average is based on only the three games, so we get 30+28+32+34=134.\n\nNext step is to calculate how many points he scores above 30. The number of points he scored above 30 is 30+32+32+30, so the solution is to add 62 above 30. \n\nHence, 62+60=122 points and the correct answer is $9 028.\n\n\n### Input:#310156410\n\n### Response:#317502234\n\n### Input:\"Snakes use their hindbody to push sand into tunnels.

Since this is a real-life financial question it would involve buying something such as a bus ticket or a pass.\n3. The question asks is the minimum number of bus rides we will need so that the pass would be cheaper than buying a 1-way ticket.\n\n#### Explanation for the answer:\n\n1. First step:\nWe will need a 30 day pass only if the number of rides is lesser than 30.\n\n```\nA 30-day ticket is $50 and a ride costs $2.\nWe will only need a 30-day tickets if the ride is less than $20.\n\nHence, we will need 15 rides at least.\n\nThis can be achieved in two ways:  \n\nBy taking 30 rides, we can get the pass for free since the cost for a ride is less than the price for a pass.\n\nIf we take only 15 rides, we must spend more than $20. Therefore we need a 30 rides or 30 day pass.\n```\n\n2. Next we must determine how many $50s we need to buy based on the rides we take.\n\n```\nTotal rides= 15\n\nSince we must spend more than a $50 ticket, lets use this \n\nFor 0 tickets, 0 less than 20\n\nfor 1 we need 49- 20+1= 28, \n\nFor 2- We need 49 - 21 = 19...\n```\n\n```\nTherefore, we must start at 29 rides to get the cheapest answer.\n\nThis can also be done by calculating how much rides we need to take:\n\nTo get the 30-Day pass for free, we must spend at least $20.\nTherefore, we have to take at least 3 passes.  \nThis can be done by taking 16 rides.\n \nTherefore, we would need at least 16", "answer": " 26"}

So Tracy drives 2 times and therefore Michelle drives as much as 5 times.\nFor the second aspect: Michelle drives 4 times as much as Katie.  \n\nThus, the total distance is 1,00 + 2 x 60 + 4 x 60=1,460  \nAnd Michelle drives 4 x 66 = 264  \nHence, she drove 270 miles total.\n\n### Input\nTracy, Michelle and Kati travel a road trip that is 1000miles in total.\n\nKati is the youngest of the three, he drives 20 miles\n\nTwice what Michelle drives, she drives 3 times what Kati drives Kati drive 2X20=40\n\nThen Michelle drives what Kati drives but 3 times\n\nSo Kati drives 40 miles\n\nMichelle therefore drive twice what Kati drives\n\nMichelle therefore drives twice the distance Kati does (140miles)\n\nPlus what she has left (70 to reach the 1000mile mark)\n\nSo total Michelle drives 150 miles\n\nThis is a 2x2x3=8x2=16 times problem\n\nThis requires some clever wording and phrasing to get an answer\n\nThis is the most logical solution", "answer": " 294"}

Choices: 1. 3 seconds A 2. 8 seconds 3. 11 seconds 4. 12 seconds 5. 14 seconds 6. 15 seconds  Rationales: The number of seconds in 11:58 is 864 less than the number of seconds in 8:18. Consequently, 11:57 - 8:18 = 3:39 -> 3:39 - 11:55 = 11:50 seconds. However, in the case of 11:56 - 8:15, the amount of seconds is more than 864 hence, 864 - 3:00 = 854 seconds while 3:01 - 8:14 = 1:13 seconds. Thus, the additional time required for number 8:15 is 1:13 but in case of 8:18, it is 3:39 seconds, hence, 3:39 > 1:13, and that's why option 3 or the option 2 is the more correct answer.\nAnswer: 8:18 is more than 11:59. More specifically, 11:28 - 11:27 = 11:29 seconds. Likewise, 11:08 - 11 minutes and -58 seconds = 11 minutes and +8 seconds. Hence, 11:18 is more.

Which is $2000.\n\n### Response Explanation\nThe question is, \u201cHow much money is Mr.Caiden required to pay\u201d. Mr. Caiden requires 650ft of metal roofing from the supplier. From this, I can solve for the cost:\n\n$8 * 650 = 12 * 549\n\nTherefore the supplier is bringing in 300 free feet of metal roofing, giving the user a total of 950 (950 - 650). If this were to be true it would mean that he has 100 additional feet of free roofing. He also owes $8*$45 to the supplier, which equals to 360. Therefore, Mr. Caiden has to pay back $8*100 + $360. His total bill from the supplier would amount to $360+$8*100 = $420 (not including the 360).\n\nNote:\n\n\u201cMr.Caiden wants to do repuirs to his house\u201d -> \u201cMr.Caiden requires to perform repairs to his house\u201d\n\n\u201cand requires 300 foot of metal roofing to does this.\u201d -> \u201c and requires 30ft of metal roofong to repai his house.\u201d\n\nDamien\n\n### Demostration answer\n\nYou know you need to replace a 30ft portion of metal roofing; each foot of roofing was given for free. 0.75 feet is 25%. I used 100ft for the additional 1000ft of free metal roofing. All you need to do is add them together as 950 +1000= 1950.

{"text": "**Step 1: Identify the type of task**\nWe can notice that this problem is designed as a back-to-back question.  The main reason why most students struggle in solving back-to-back type problems is not because we can't find the answer to this, but we need to find the relationship between the two variables to solve the problem. So let us begin by looking at the variables first.\nA movie theater has a bunch of screens which show movies\nThere are no boundaries about how many screens they have. They could have as many screens as they like.\nWe need to know, in this question, what's the unit of measurement for the screens. Is it \"screens\" or \"movies\"? This is a common confusion for students.\nSo our first assumption is that the unit of measurement is screens. In other words, we can just assume that there are 6 screens and each movie is shown on exactly one screen. If this assumption is wrong, you have to reconsider before solving the problem.\nLet us say there are 6 screens, which each show one movie each. We know that the movie theater is going to be open for 8 hours. \n\nThe second step is to work out what \"open for 8 hours\" actually means. In different contexts, the meaning of \"open for X hours\" can be different e.g. \"open\" as in \"from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm\", \"open\" as in available, and \"open\" as in open all day. To avoid confusion, it's always better to be clear about the context. Based on what we know here, it is clear that the movie theater will be open all day.\nNow the question asks us: \"How many movies are shown throughout the day?\" \nFrom the knowledge we have learnt so far we know that 8 hours is one day, so the number of movies shown in one day is 6. So the answer is D: 6.\n\n### Input\nWhich of the following food substances ABOVE contains the most fat?

Choices: A: none B: 2 C: 4 D: 5 E: 6 F: 36 G: 72 H: 243\nRationales: The teacher ensures fair treatment in picking prizes for each sixth grade student by setting up a lottery system. If the lottery number happens to be the same as the number of the student who draws out a chip, then he or she gets a laptop. Here is a list of all the different ways that this can happen. Each letter represents a student in the lottery. So, A represents student A, B represents student B, and so on. The teacher wants to make sure that the 25 students who are drawn out in each of the sacks get a prize, too. \n1.\tA\t2.\tA\t3.\tB\t4.\tB\t5.\tC\t6.\tC\t7.\tD\t8.\tD", "answer": " 80"}

Of course, you get that by dividing 150 by 35. You want to know how many tons of fruit it takes to make 5000 lbs.

But, we can't give it in lbs as the teacher wants us to do!\n\nFirst of all, to find out what the number of tons is, I have to find the total weight of fruit and get mass. Then, I'll divide by kilos. The total mass will then be equal to the total fruit times the mass. To find out how much that mass is, I'll take the fruit given up and the fruit per acre or fruit per plant. In my case, it will be 150 kg per tree. I want to make sure I've got the units right. I will need 150 kg/acre x 365 trees; what is 150 kg acre? First you divide by 100, get 1.5 then you multiply by 100 to get 150. It is 150 per tree. So, do some quick math and you get 2000000/200 is 100000 lb or 10 tons of fruit.\n\nThey've given the number of fruit, and there's a way to determine the mass of the fruit.

{"text": "18 cans of soda\n\n### Input\nAnswers:A:18 cansB:30 cans\n\nRationales:Option A:\n\nThe factory makes cans of soda every 30 minutes with 30 cans produced in an hour. So, the can-making machine will make 8 cans in the hour, a total of 24 in one day. Then, with 80 minutes in a day, there will be 10 more cans produced in day = 34 cans every day. In this period of time (8 hours), a total of 34 x 8 = 288 cans will be made. The answer will be 456 in the entire time.\n\nOption B:\n\nThe question seems to imply 30 cans were produced every 30 minutes. So if one machine produced 30 cans every 30 minutes and there are 16 machines in the factory, the factory will be able to make 30 cans each minute and produce 4,800 cans a day. Multiplying it by 8, one can compute there will be 38,400 cans produced in 8 hours. This is inaccurate because the question is worded as 'in one hour'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. A machine produces 30 can cans in an hour and, in an 8 hours time period, 240 cans will be produced. The answer is then, 240 x 8 = 1,920.\n\n### Input", "answer": " 480"}

This means that if we want to find what two numbers will make 22 divided by y equal to x, then we will just simply multiply those two whole numbers by x divided by y to prove it.\n\n#### Expectation\n\nExpectation regarding the answer to be like this :\n\n```\n22+13=35 which equals to 22 divided by the quotient 22 divided by two whole numbers 13.\n\n22/13=22/x*13=35\n\nTherefore, 35 is the sum of the two whole numbers.\n```\n```\n22 divided by 22 which has no reminder therefore, 22/22=1 then,\n\n1,", "answer": " 42"}

One can choose the right answer and yet not be given a satisfactory reasoning. This is because the reasoning is embedded in the text and will be easily understood if the student has the full background knowledge of the topic.

{"text": "In order to answer the question, we need to determine what is considered \"neither crumpled or bold\". \n\nIf the printing is crumpled and blurred, then none in the bunch is \"neither crumplled or bold\".\n\nSince we have no information about how \"blured\" is, we can consider that crumpling and blurring can be seen as a spectrum where crumpling is the end goal and blurring is the last step on the way there. If it were possible to use the word \"crumpled\" for 20 pages (or any other number for that matter) and then using the word \"blurred\" for the next two pages, then we would have \"neither crumpler or blurred\" after those 22 pages.\n\nSo in order to give the answer the question requires we have to ask ourselves how \"blurred\" can be.\n\nTo determine that, we have to look at how bad or severe the blur can be. We can assume that using the same word for such a long time of pages should indicate the exact opposite it does in the real world.\n\nSo we know that \"neithers\" means \"both\". If the 22 pages are all \"neither crumpling or bolding\", we can assume that the word \"blur\" (or any other word that mean crumpling) is applied for each page in a very long sentence using that word exclusively.\n\nSo we can answer the question that out of 42 pages, exactly 6 would be neither crumpled nor blurred by default.\n\nAnswer: Exactly 6 \n\n### Input\n\nWhat is ____?\n```\n   A: a question B: foodstuff C: a cat D: a house E: a friend F: a job\n```\nAnswer: `D`: A house", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "Rick's 5 sisters gave Miguel\n### Rationales: Answer: Rationales: Miguel recieved a total of ##3## cards since Rick also gave 3 cards equally to his 2sisters\n### Input: There are 3 boys and 3 girls at the orphanage. It is decided that the girls and boys will be alternately in charge of the dorm at the orphanage one week at a time. Which of the following would be the correct sequence for doing so following these rules? Choices:  - Girl 1, Girl 2, Boy 1, Boy 2, Girl 1, Girl2, Boy 1\n\nA: Boy 1, Girl 1, Boy 1, Girl2\nB: Girl 2, Boy2, Girl 2, Girl 2\nC: Girl 1, Girl3, Boy 2, Boy 2,Girl1, Boy1\nD: Boy 1, Boy1, Boy 2, Girl1, Girl 1\nE: Girl 3, Girl 2,Girl 2, Girl1\n\nRationales: Choice A states that the girls, girl1, girl2 in that order alternates every week with the boys, boy1, boy2. The sequence of girl2-boy2-girl1 alternates every week. It then states that this continues on where the order for the weeks is: boy1-girl1-girl3. This sequence makes sense since in choice B, girl2 comes first, followed by boy2 and then girl1, while boy1 is third. Following this, the week proceeds with girl1-boy1-boy2. This sequence makes sense, since initially when girl2 comes first, boy2 then comes second, which makes sense. Since the boys initially come in the second position. This is followed by girl3. Hence the sequence is girl3-boy1, girl1. Choice D comes up to the same as the initial statement of the problem (girls first), but fails to state that the boys come first.\n### Input: The number of people who purchased apples, bananas, and pears is shown in the table below.

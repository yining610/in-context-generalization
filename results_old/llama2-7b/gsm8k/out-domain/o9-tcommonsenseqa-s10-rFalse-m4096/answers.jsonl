It is difficult to calculate the exact time it takes to get somewhere, but the question states a plane traveling to Cape town, and since he arrived in New York at 6am Monday, it is logical to calculate the time to get there. Since the number of hours it took to arrive in Cape town is one, then it took 18 hours to arrive in New york, then we can solve for how many hours it took to get to Cape town.

The person is not dumbing it down, it's the person saying something that is too easy to figure out, so it doesn't make a person look smart, it just makes a person look easier to understand. Saying the sentence I can understand that, it'll seem easier to understand. It can't be too hard to say, but it also needs to be accurate.\n\n### Another way\nTaylor Swift, I'm obsessed with you, sounds weird right? The reason it sounds weird is because most of the sentence is dumb. Most people want to sound smart, so they wouldn't say, \"I'm obsessed with...\" instead, it would be, \"I'm totally obsessed with...\" or \"I'm very obsessed with...\" or even \"I am madly in love with...\" So it wouldn't", "answer": " 2"}

This is done because the airbag is what makes the passenger, the person in the seat, fly forward. This is a result of the rapid expansion of gas in a small space. The force generated by that sudden expansion is known as ____.\n\n### Paragraph:Because airbag's deployment occurs so quickly, it has been designed to only work in conjunction with a human passenger who is sitting in the seat, the side of the seat, or the front seat. If someone were sitting directly next to the steering wheel, the person would not be wearing the seatbelt, and may even be thrown backward, the vehicle would not have the ability to know that someone, in this case, the passenger, would not respond to seatbelt reminders, as the airbag will always inflate. They have also made sure to place the bags around the passenger area, because an unintentionally deployed airbag could potentially injure the pedestrian. It is possible for an airbag to rupture the cabin if the person is hit directly in the chest and throws the person into the airbag. Another problem is that airbags could be hit by objects that are thrown by the force of the airbag deploying. These objects could range from phones or bottles to children's toys.

{"text": "The response should provide an answer and explanation that describes an overall strategy and/or solution to demonstrate an understanding of the task requirements.\n\nIn order to answer this problem, I will start by dividing 10 kg of butter into three parts as follows:\n\n<div class=\"math-img-container\">\n<img class=\"math-item img-fluid\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/gkKVrjW/math.jpg\" alt=\"math\" height=\"300\" width=\"630\"> <div>\n</div>\n</div><br /><br />\n\nAs we know, there are two different ways of breaking down the problem: The first option is to multiply the decimal value by 2.5, 5 and 3 respectively and the second, less optimal option is to split the amount into thirds, fifths, and half (excluding 0.04) and subtract the parts.\n\nThe first option is definitely the option with more accuracy and less work, because I get the desired result the most time efficient way. And the more accurate result can't be bad either.\n\nLet's start with the multiplication by 2.5 method. I start by setting 10K to be multiplied with the values I selected and the result is 8.975, as you can see above. I repeat with peanut butter and chocolate and obtain -5.381 and 37.2.\n\nSince we can simplify, I can get the -5.38 as 4 and 37. as 14.7.\n\nSubtracting 14.7 from 8.97 results in 5.27, I subtract the same amount with my remaining amount of butter and end up with 0.07.\n\nI just divided by the decimal values I got from multiplication with a 2.5, ending in 4, 14.7 and 2.7.\n\nSo, I end up with -6.38 kg after making all three types of cookies.\n\nI will now explain this strategy and solution in more detail.\n\nTo get started, I figured it might be easier to just set 10 to a total value of 10. I then multiply it with the values 1", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "The weekly average amount of books borrowed is 48. The maximum amount of books borrowed in a week if the week is open is 96 books. The maximum amount of weekly allowed books is 96. The weekly amount should be reduced to 64 to be able to borrow the maximum amount. The daily percentage is 5% larger than the daily average. The answer is 41. That is why to obtain the weekly average of books borrowed I had to subtract 24 from the daily percentage 15%. I also needed to subtract 24 to ensure that I do not exceed the weekly maximum of 96 books. To get the weekly average of 41 I divided the weekly maximum by the 5 day week. To get the fraction I subtracted 15%. When I get the decimal part I multiply.4(the original percentage) by the number of days borrowing books is allowed. What I did was use the.4(15% or.4) and multiply it to the weeks total number of days borrowing. Multiplying the 48 by.4(15%) I obtain.192.

To find the total after you subtracted the 9 tenths, you will have to divide the original total by 10. In this case, there were 330, so we had to divide the first number by 10.

{"text": "He would be left with 12 tomatoes.\n\nAnswer: The key to solving this problem is to understand the logic of the question and the information the question is asking for. For example, the question says, 'he would be left with 9 tomatoes'. However, the answer to this question is actually 12 tomatoes because the question says he is 'left' with tomatoes and not dried or turned into sauce.\nThe logic to solving this question is therefore to multiply the number of plants by the number of tomatoes per plant, as this is the number of total tomatoes available. When each tomato is turned into sauce or dried, it is obvious that 1/3 of the tomatoes are turned into sauce or 4, while the other 2/3 of the tomatos are dried, as this is the amount of tomatos left in the tomato. The 1/3 of tomatoes that are dried come to a total of 7 dried tomatos while the 2/3 of tomatos that are turned into sauce come to a total of nine dried tomatos and the question states that the 'tomatos are turned into sauce and not dried'. This gives the answer of 12 tomatos, as each dry tomato equals 2 dry tomatos, and the same applies to the tomatos made into sauce.\n\n### Input : A car rented in London was returned to Brighton, how does that affect your mileage?\n\n### Answer :Your mileage is actually 160 miles, which is half way from London to Brighton which is a total of 320 miles.\n\n### Demo :\nAn example of the calculation process to solving this problem is shown below, as follows:\n\nThe initial problem will start of as saying a car rented in London is rented to Brighton, the distance between London and Brighton is 320 miles, the car is not driving any faster in Brighton or London than it is in London and Brighton, therefore the total mileage for the London to Brighton trip is 320.\n\nThe answer to the above initial question is 320, if you now divide 320 by 2 you will be left with 160 miles which is the actual mileage.\n\n### Output:Which of the following statements is", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "Mark is owed 3200 dollars, 4500 dollars after the lawyer, which would mean a total of 7700 dollars. \n\n### Explanation:\n\n**Calculations:** \n- First we find how many dollars Mark owes for speeding. He was 45 miles per hour over the speed limit. If the cost was $50 for each mile, the fine would cost $225. \n- He also owes an additional $2 per mile he was over, so we add that to the speeding fine. \n- That totals $247. \n- We also see that Mark is doubling the fine because he was going 45 miles per over the speed limit in a school zone. This would double the fine to $494. \n- Finally Mark owes his lawyer $80 for every hour over 3 hours, so we multiply that by 3 and Mark is owed $240 for the lawyer cost. \n- We put together all the information and it gives us $494 + 240 = 734 dollars.\n- $3200 is the amount total for the speeding ticket and the lawyer fees.\n \n### Instruction 2:Answer each of the questions below by creating and completing a flowchart that solves the task and uses appropriate terminology to describe its steps.", "answer": " 820"}

We could get a number higher than 60 with that because 237-237 = 0 or 237-(-237) = 0. However, if we had added 60 and subtracted 0 we would have gotten 237 because 60+0 = 60 and 237-60 = 177.

She wants to spend $500 and she wants to save $400. So she could take 32 x 11 which is 352 and that is her weekly income. Then she can subtract $900 from $352 which is $262. So that is her spending for the week and then you subtract the spending from the income and if you get a negative number then that is how much you have. In this case it is negative and she has $400 in her savings account.\n\n### Task name:\nWrite a complete sentence in English that shows this process.", "answer": " 720"}

{"text": "The $0.25 discount, applied on a twice monthly basis to the subscription, is roughly equivalent to $0.33. Thus, a subscriber only needs to pay $33.67 for the entire 18-month period. That is 18 months times $33.65, or $608.70 (assuming constant subscription cost throughout the 18-period). With the promotion, the subscriber pays $635 (18 months times 34). Since 608.7 is less that 635 (608.7-635=38) and 608.8 is greater than 635 (38), the promotion saves $26 (635-608.7=26.3). The final step is to simply calculate the percentage savings: 26.3/34=0.76 (two significant digits in each number).\nWe obtain an approximate discount of 76%.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "The hay farmer harvests an average of 560 bags of hay per month from 5 acres of land, meaning 132 bales per acre, so 560/132=4.2 acres of hay per month per acre.\n\nThere are 365 days in one year, thus 4.2 acres x 365 days= 1501 acres harvested during the year. There is 7 acres of grass planted, so (1501 acres x 5 acres)=286 acres from grass planted during the year. Thus 5 acres from the year before were harvested, and 286 acres have been planted, and the additional 7 acres will be harvested during the next 400 days. Now the number of acres that are being harvested for grass is equal to the number of acres that have been harvested the year before, and that gives us 286 acres harvested for grass, and 220 acres have grass planted and will grow this year.\n\nIf the farmer owns 9 horses that consume 3 bales of grass per day, then 9 horses would consume 3 bales, or 3/3= 1 bale of grass per day each horse, with a total of 9 bales of grass consumed per day, per horse. There are 7 acres of grass being harvested, and there are 9 horses that consume an average of 1 bag per day, so 9 bags or 3 bales per day per animal.\n\nThis means that there 9 x 3 bales or 3 bales of 9 animals, so there is 3 bales per animal, per day to consume from grass planted. Thus there is 9 bales x 3 bales= 27 bales of grass per horse per day that will be consumed at the end of 286 days.\n\nThere are only 30 days in September, so there is 286 remaining days to consume the grass planted.

Letter one is going to be the letter E or otherwise known as the first card. This card only has one letter on it which is what makes sense to choose the 'E' card. The second letter chosen is the 'S'. As you can see there are two letters on the second card and the same for the fourth as well. However, if you take a closer look you can see that they are missing the letter 'O'. Since the second and fourth card are missing only one letter in each case, and these letters can only be chosen if you choose the letter 'E'. The next card is the 'W' which obviously has 3 letters. Lastly there is card 4 which also has three letters.

Finally, adding seven to ninety-six results in 99. The number 99 is 3 times 33, and 3 is the same as adding nine and nine. Therefore, we subtract nine and nine and get 0.

This function counts how many times words in the sentence. It does that by looping through each character (letter) in the sentence and checking to see if that alphabet character is in the word_list.\n\nLetter `m` is the first letter in the word \"michael\" and `n` is the last letter in the word \"angel\" (the letters in alphabetical order). If the first and last letter match, it will not include the letter in the count, otherwise include in.  To find more words, change `[- 1]` to `[- 2]` in the method name.\n\nTo see the words I added to the solution, I used `word_list = list(str(sentence).split(' '))`. This makes an empty list.  For each alphabet character I added, if it exists in the list, the index will be 0.  However, if it is not in the list, I added it to the list.  This is because the first letter in \"michael\" is the first in the alphabet, but not the first in the \"michael\" wordlist.", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "The stamp collecting activity led to 39 stamps being collected by the three collector, after Alison gave a novel to Anna, Anna traded Jeff two mountain stamps in exchange for one bluebird stamp. Thus it can be concluded that Alison\u2019s collection had 44 stamps after the trading was completed, and then after exchanging with Jeff, the number of stamps decreased by 9, which means there are 35 stamps in Alison\u2019s collection afterwards. And Anna, who had 37 stared her collection with, has 37 stamps at the end (plus the novel). So, Anna received 44 stamps at the end of the trading activity. Adding Anna and Alison\u2019s collections together, 79 stamps were obtained as a whole, and subtracting 31 stamps, they have 48 stamps at the end. But if you consider Jeff\u2019s collection, who had 31 sticks at the start, his original number of stamps got reduced from 31 to 22 in the activity, hence Jeff had 22 stamps in the end. Thus, Anna, who had 79 stamps at the beginning of the activity, had 48 stamps in the end of the activity. Jeff who started with 31 stamps at the beginning, had 22 sticks at the end, and the initial number of stamps obtained by Alison were 44, now containing 35 stamps.", "answer": " 50"}

For example, this restaurant had $2.25 beers if they sold one pint a minute.\n\nIn this case, the price per drink is the same as the price per minute.  The total sales divided 8 gives you the total revenue. In the example case, the total revenue was $2.25 x 8 x 1,000,000 gives you $168.

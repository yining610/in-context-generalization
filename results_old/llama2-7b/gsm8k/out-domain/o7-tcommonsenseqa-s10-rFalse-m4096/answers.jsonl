{"text": "10\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst, we need to note how many total gnomes are on the street (20), so we know the total for all houses except five. We assume first house has 0 gnomes.\nSecond, we count how many gnomes are in house 1 and we note it.\nThird, we take the number on house 1 that we have noted before and add to it.\nFourth, we divide the total gnomes by 5 and multiply by 0.99 (this number will be shown as 'x' for the remainder of the post), since there are 5 houses and we divide by 4 because the fifth house does not use any gnomes, but multiplied by 4 because the other houses will have gnomes because they do not use half of them.\nFifth, we use the gnome count that we have just calculated in the fourth step and we start again with the first house. We add the number of gnomes in the first house back to those on the second house by dividing the product of the fourth step by 4 because there are 4 houses left.\nWe will now try to explain what we have written above.\n\nFirst, let's start with the total number of gnomes that we think are on all houses except house #5 (20). Then we take house #1 and we take the number that we add to this gnomes of this house and add it to every other house's gnome count by dividing it by 4 because it has not taken them. Then we go to house #2 and again note the gnomes. For example, the gnomes in the second house are two. Then it's in the fourth step that we took the 20 and divided it by 4, since we left that 4. Then we divided the number that we called 'y' by 4 and we found that the house with one gnomes in house has x = 20 / 4, so x = 5; house with x = 5 gnomes have 5; house with y = 36 / 20, so y = 1.8 and x = 5 and we go into the fifth house and we repeat the steps above.\n\nFor example:\n\n`total = 20` because there are", "answer": " 8"}

How many items sell for $11?\n\n### Bonuses Answer:\n\nThe shop sells about an item with an average dollar sum of 10. It would mean that in order to meet the total that was set, you would have to put a minimum of 10 (the standard dollar sum) and a max of 90 (9x10). This means that you would have to purchase 7.295 items, and there is only 5.295 items that sold for 11 dollars. Hope you got all that.\n\n### Question:\nThe shop sells items with an mean dollar summation of 10. ________________________________________\n\n### Bonuties Answer:\nThe shop seller sells products with a median dollar total of 10._____________________________________ This means that they sold 15 products which meant for 2x15 which is 15 items.", "answer": " 10"}

Each book costs $5 to produce making a total cost of $20. The person can buy either 1 book for $5 or 2 books for $10. The customer can only purchase 2 books at a time making the total cost to the customer $20 plus the $4 shipping fee.\n\nTina sells 20 books which she must give 80% of her profits to her 5 business partners. If Tina did not make a profit of $100 her partners should give her 80% of the $100 and 20% would be deducted from each partners pay. If Tina makes a profit of $12, she would receive $96 and her 5 business partners would pay her $3.\n\nIt is unclear how much profit Tina made from sales because it says there is a $120 fee total but Tina only paid $100 which would be the $96 profit and the $4 shipping cost. There is extra cost not listed as income which includes shipping and other costs to operate the business and Tina needs to include the value of shipping fees and the work Tina puts in running her business. To compensate for the time and other costs, I will use a 30% fee from the profits to cover any costs such as fees, advertising, etc. I will make a revenue estimate of $200 which includes $180 for the 5% business partners pay and $20 for covering $140 in profit as business partners will share equally all profits.\n\nFor the profit formula which includes the $120 fee, I used the values and added this value to make the profit.

Each time her amount by which she learns to juggle something will increase by 2.\n\nSo lets assume that from week 1 to week 2 we need to increase the amount by 1.\n\nSo she can juggle:\n\nIn week 1 she can juggle nothing.\n\nIn week 2 she can juggle 1 object.\n\nNow let's assume a total amount of x objects and lets assume the value of y is the maximum that you can juggle.\n\nSo the final result after 2 weeks would be:\n\ny - x = 1\n\nIn week 3 she can juggle: 1,2\n\nIn week 4 she can juggle: y - 2 = 4\n\nAnd lets assume her max amount of objects is 7 which is y so that would mean that she is going to be able to juggle: 7,7,6,6,5,4 (or 6,5,4,3,2)\n\nIn week 5 she can juggle:7,7,6\n\nSo we already have our answer when we find her at week 5, she can juggle: (7,7,6) = 12 (5 roundings for juggling (or 8)\n\nSo the max amount of objects Jeanette can juggle is 12 (5 rountings (this is called the \"Fibbonomial\")\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\\12", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "The first step to solving this equation is to isolate every variable that we are going to have to convert to fractions. For example, since you are looking for the percentage in each type of bar, every variable we are given must be converted to a fraction of total bars.\n\n### \n\n### Input\nAn example of two variables expressed in fractions is 7/8 and 3/4.\n\n### Output(s)\nYou are looking for percentages. The percentage is the same as fractional unit of a whole. Since 100% equals one whole, this is the same as the ratio 100/100 and its reciprocal 1/100. Since you are only working with fractions, we can write the ratio as 25/25. However, we do not want the fractions to be in their simplest form. Therefore we will multiply them to be 15/120.\n\n### Solution\nThe fraction of dark chocolate is 15/25 or 15/100, and therefore 0.15 dark chocolate for every 100 chocolate bars. The fraction of milk chocolate almond bars is also 15/200 and 15/1,000 and therefore.015 for every 10 and 100 bars respectively. The fraction of white chocolate is 5/200. Therefore, the fraction of white chocolates 0.005 for every 200 bars. Finally, to calculate the fraction of milk chocolates, we multiply by themselves to get an answer of 0.15 (0.015 x 0.015). If we add the numbers in the first row and third row, we get 0.20. That means that there are 20% of milk chocolaty chocolate bars.\n\n<ins class=\"ins-class\" class=\"ins-inputs\" data-instruction-id='37239' data-out-instruction-id=\"16599\" data-out-example=\"2.7\" data-answer=\"253.298032%\">\n  <span class=\"ins-field\">\n    <span class", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "In order to answer this question it would first depend on the amount of sour apples they get per day. So lets take the amount of apples the tree gives him and divide it by how much percentage of them are sour and how much is sweet. So that would be $40/0.75*35=16.666667 which is the highest number that can fit in the box for $16.66 then to make that fit and give an answer to the question you would have to add at least 3.33 to $13.33 per apple.\n\n### Input 2: A man buys a 240 cubic inch motorcycle. How much does it weigh in pounds?\n\n### Demostration:\nSo to answer this question it is very simple. To find out what the weight is, all you have to do is find out what.240 weighs in pounds and then multiply that by however many cubic inches a 240 has. So.240 pound is 240. Lets say a cubic inch has exactly.02 pounds that would be the same for 1000 cubic inches because.20 pounds is 20 pounds. So our answer is 240 cubes in.240 ponds, then our answer is 60.00 pounds that is. So 28199.9999 pounds is a more precise answer to what it really is.\n\n#### Question: A bookstore has 217,999 books, all which are less than 500 pages. How many of these are 0-5 pages?

Answer: 7:00 PM\n\n### Explamation:\nIf the increase is 10 cents, I'm guessing the decrease was 20 cents\n\n### Input ;\nThe price of gas was lower over three days.

{"text": "First, the teacher needs to find out how much each student wants, then she needs to find out how many packages of each are needed to make the bags. Then, she should use the multiplication property of multiplication to find a number that would make a profit. The equation is: Profit = AX - BC, where A is the total value of the bags you want to purchase, X is the total number of bags you want to buy, B is the cost of one bag, and C is the number of bags you need.\n\nThe teacher needs to buy A15 (the total number of bags desired) packages of B14 (the pumpkin bag) and B11 (vampire's bag).

The hamburgers cost $1 and it costs $9 to fill your tank.  How much should you charge for the hamburger if you charge a profit percentage of 25%?\n\n###  Response:\nUse the multiplication property of multiplication: (P1)(P2) = (Q1)(Q2).  That is, price 1 times price 2 = quantity 1 times quantity 2.  Let P be the price of gasoline, and L be the price of the hamburgers. Then, (L*Qg)/(P*T) = (P*L)/(Qg*T).  Dividing both numerator and denominator by P, we get Qg / T = L/T.  Rearranging, we get T = L/Qg.  Plugging in our given values, we have: (1) = (L/Qg)*(10), or 1 = (L/Q)*10.  L/Qg = 10.  As we know, 0.25 is 25% of 100, and we use the equation 100(25/100) to calculate the total profit.  Profit = (100 / 4)* (P /", "answer": " 17"}

{"text": "$24;$24.50\n\n### Instructions:\nDescribe, or explain, how an algorithm that could complete this task might be implemented.\n\n### Details:\nConsider the following scenarios in which this solution could be used.\n\n1. For a student: \n    * The student enters a string to be parsed that is either a unit(ex: lb ounce), a number, or a unit (ex: 2oz), and is asked to parse the string into two values: a unit value and a number value. A unit is either \"lb\" or \"oz\". \n    * To parse, the string is converted to letters, and the space between the units and values are removed to create a list of numbers (ex: lb ounce). The units and values are then used to search for them in the dictionary to convert the strings into numbers and units respectively. \n\n2. For a store: \n    * Customers enter a string to be parsed in the form of their \"pick up time\", for example, 10:00 AM, 7:06 AM, and so on.  \n    * The store's stock room is closed 30 minutes after the last employee clocked out. The employee's shift ends at 4:00 PM and the store's \"pick up time\" closes at 6:00 PM. The store uses the number as a constraint in the form of a timer to make sure customers are given enough time to pick up their items. If the customer's pick up time is not within the range of the store's operating time, the shop sends the customer a message that its open hours is over. \n        * To parse, the user enters a string. The user is asked to enter the number 1 for when the store starts to operate, any \"time range\" could have the values of 4:00 to 6:30. \n        * The user is also asked to enter the \"closing timer\" 30, which is an indicator of the number of minutes the employee's closing.  \n    * After 6:30 PM, the store is closed. \n        * After hours, the number 5, which is an indicator that the time is outside the store's operating hours, is assigned to a variable and returned to the user.", "answer": " 10"}

This parameter is just being declared before the age variable, because in python variables can only reside inside of functions called variables.\n\n### Hints:\n- Age is assigned, when the function is being called. The age can be changed to something else if the function is called later in the code. Meaning when the function is called there is not an age being assigned.\n- If you run through this code on your own and try to do the \"age = 0\" part. This line of code will not pass, because the age variable already exists before any of that code runs. I hope this makes some sense to you.

We are given that two episodes of Jeopard and two episodes of Wheel of fortune. Wheel of fortune has twice as many minutes as Jeopardy, so we multiply 20 minutes by two. This gives us 40 minutes. Because each episode was twice as long as Jeopardy. That means there were 160 minutes total. This adds up to 154 minutes after you add the two 20 minutes. This is the same as 54 minutes.

{"text": "The first step on this problem is to understand how much should spend on a younger sister because the second step is to subtract from the first one. The first step is to see Tonya how much should spend on her younger sister. And in order to know the answer to this you need to find 4 dolls so you know that each doll cost $15. Subtotal of $60. The second step is to subtract 60 from 86 what is left behind is $26 then subtract that amount from 26 then you will have 0. What can you do after that you can divide 0 by 2 you will get the result which will be 0 or $13. If you have a 6 digit calculator you can use that because 7 times 13 is 80. The final part of this is that 4 dolls times 13 will make a total of $52 so she will be spending $150 on her younger sister and $72 on her older sister because you can subtract $150 from $86 and the result you get will be $72.\n\n### Input\nI am sorry to inform you that today is a _________________.\n\n### Response\nThe blank should be filled with today is a __________________.

So, each of those 90 pupils would need to be fit into one of the 7 rectangular tables of the library. It is now necessary to subtract the pupils in the rectangular tables from 90 to work out what fraction of the 7 tables is taken. To perform these calculations we can begin by dividing 10 by 90. \n\nThen, subtracting 1 from that result will give you 63% of the 7 tables are not being used. So, in total that means 2 tables are left empty. One of these tables is a rectangular table and can fit either 9,9,9 or 8,9 pupils. The other table is a square table and can fit 4 pupils. That means that 88% of the 90 pupils are fitting into 6 rectangular tables with a combined area of two-thirds of the area of 10 pupil tables, leaving 2% of the 9 pupils not able to be accommodated into 1, square table.\n\nSo when you divide 90 by 10 it will give you 9 that 90 pupil can read at same time using 6  rectangular tables and 1 square table.\n\n### Input2:\nCouncilman Pete is out on a tour of his city.

{"text": "A: There are 50 movies shown throughout the day\n\n### Reason: The amount of movies shown in a theater is equal to the number of screens the theater contains. The theater only has one screen. Since the answer to the part 5 of the questions is one screen, the answer to the question must also be one screen. Now multiplying both sides of the equation by 8 and by a number that is equivalent to 2 hours, we see that the amount of movies the theater shows is equal to 8. Since there are 50 minutes in each of the movie screenings, the number of movies shown throughout the entire day is equal to the amount of movie screens in the theater. Now we see that  that 50 = 1 and we answer the question by saying A: There are 1 movies shown throughout the DAY.\n\n### Sample Answer: You are a sales representative and you are on a call with your boss who is helping you to improve your numbers in the last quarter of the year.

{"text": "The grill ran for:\n\n3960 minutes \n\n### The Questions\n\nWhen I go into a store to buy what I need, I have to choose the best product. It is a skill. If I purchase the \"wrong\" product, then I must return the product and purchase the right one. It is time-consuming. I save time in my life when I make the right choices.\n\nThe questions make sure I am using the right words for correct English. The answers are in the text, but they give my thoughts, too.\n\nI used to watch math videos that teach concepts. Some used the same words as the questions. I learned a lot from the videos, but I had to take the questions. I did not learn the words in the questions when I watched the videos. The questions helped with some of the words I thought I knew. They gave me the questions to get the words.\n\n### Response\n\n- I believe questions are a good thing because they teach someone how to correctly use a word or words in a sentence. They can also teach someone what something means. Questions tell a person that they need to learn something. I like questions because they make a person want to read.\n\n### What is the question?\n\nThe questions are used to teach people how to use the correct word. They also test to see if a person knows words and how they are used.\n\n### How are questions helpful for learning English?\n\nThe questions were helpful because at times I was unsure of how to say what I was thinking. For example, the question says, \u201cWhat would need oil to be use?\u201d and I thought I could say \u201cto use,\u201d but it was wrong. In that question, \u201cneed\u201d is part of a verb. I can say, \u201cI need oil\u2026\u201d but to use the word \u201cuse\u201d with the verb \u201cneed,\u201d it would have to be, \u201cto use.\u201d I would have to put a verb with the word \u201cneed.\u201d\n\n### What are questions like when you are learning English?\n\nI would like to know how to learn how to understand a question when English is not my first language. I know that a person would need to find questions that they have trouble with and find out what the meaning of the words is. A person would also need a person to go over things with them.

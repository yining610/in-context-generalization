{"text": "Julie should read 60 pages. A: 52 pages B: 58 pages C: 64 pages D: 65 pages E: 80 pages\n\n### Answer:\nInput: A: 52 B: 58 C: 64 D: 65 E: 80\nRationales: Let the original pages be numbered 0-120. The amount of pages read at T2 is twice the amount read at T1. We know it is a positive integer. Therefore, the amount of pages read at that time is between 12 (which is half of 24) and 24. Let's call this quantity X12. The amount of pages Julie has left to read is (120 - X12). Let's call this X13. Therefore, (120 - (X12 * 2 = (120 - 24) = 96) / 2 = X13. Julie should read [(96/2 +1) pages] tomorrow, which is equal to [(96/4)+1] pages to make the total pages read equal to 60.

{"text": "Janice started with 1544 sentences. 1544 - 536 = 1008. Janice typed 54 sentences out of the 1008 she started with.\n\n### Rationales:Input:Janice can type six sentences per minute. Today, she typed 18 minutes more and then took a break. She finished typing 15 more minutes and then had to erase twenty lines. She finished the day typing 536 additional lines and by taking the first part into account, we can calculate how many \n\n### Rationale:Answer\nThe total amount of sentences she typed at the end of the day is 536. 536 + 20 = 556. Therefore she started typing 556 words for the first part. Then at the very end, she had 20 lines of text to erase. She didn't need to retype 20 lines though because she had them on the paper when she left for the day. She just needed to look at the 20 lines and move them away. Since she didn't retype them, this reduced the amount of total words down to 544.\n\nNow the sentence says that \"by the end of the day\" she had 544 words \"total\" of sentences.\n\nTherefore, she typed 556 - 20 = 768 new sentences.\n\nAdd the 768 (total) and the 1544 (start, total) together to find out how many sentences she started typing\n\nAnswer: 425\n\nAnswer: D: burn hot\n\nAnswer: 6\n\nAnswer: C: burn hot\n\n#### Rationales:\n**E:** Burn hot is not a place a person can go to purchase gasoline. \n\n**B:** Fuel tank, although a vehicle may need gasoline to function, they have to obtain it from outside it.\n\n**A:** Burn hot is an action that a vehicle performs using the gasoline obtained from outside of the vehicle. \n\n**C:** Burn hot refers to a place, where, or what the gasoline obtained is used, and that would be the car.\n\n**F:** If a person wants gasoline, and they do not already have", "answer": " 258"}

The next day is a Sunday, so the next day will be a Monday and 1 car travels up the street each day. This gives a total of 161 cars on Monday, bringing the total number of cars to 160.\n\n**d) On the weekend on Sunday, 20% is 0.2 so 20% less = 0.8 of 25 (21.25) which = 19.25\n\nOn Saturday, 5% is 0.5 if 10 cars travel down the street that day = 0.5 * 10 = 5\n\nHence, a total of 20.25 cars travel down the street on weekends.\n\n**e) On Friday, 20% more is 0.2 and 1 additional car(21) = 21.2\n\nOn Thursday, 5 cars travel down that day(5+21 more = 26.2)\n\nHence, 26.25 cars travel on the weekdays.\n\nTherefore, we have (160.5+15+16.25+20.25) * 5 =160 cars total.\n\n### Response 2:\n**Let a value of 'x' represent the number of", "answer": " 97"}

According to the dictionary, old means \u201cof or relating to people in their old age.\u201d\n\nIn English Grammar, a sentence can be categorized as either simple or compound. A simple sentence is just what the term says: a single thing (e.g., sentence, phrase, or word) that has no dependent clauses. When you read it, the sentence appears without any breaks or pauses. A compound sentence, on the other hand, is connected to a dependent clause. It has at least two independent clauses that are connected together with a coordinating conjunction, such as and, but or or.\n\nAs you read through this booklet, remember that these rules can also teach you how to become better at written and spoken English.

The annual loan installment is ($432 * 12)/$1200 = 3.6, or three point six dollars per month.\n\nIn the next 2 years, he owes - $6000 - 6000 * 2/12 * 2 = - $2,200, so he owes an extra -2000+$3.6 = $574\n\nOverall, paying off the loan in 2 years will cost him: $1200+1600 + (3.6 * 3 years) = 1600$.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1) A 3.6 dollars per month is the extra amount of money gary will need to spend each month to repay in 2 years. However, this monthly payment is not included in the original cost of 6,000 dollars. The cost is actually 6,001 dollars instead of 6,036 dollars since it also includes the interest payment.\n\n2) This is an example of a geometric sequence.

{"text": "Jessica pays $3819 for her expenses over this past year in comparison with the previous fiscal year.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. We start by observing the information being given, the amount Jessica paid for rent, food, and car insurance. Jessica paid $1,000 for rent each month.\n2. She paid $200 for each month her food costs. Jessica paid $200 each month for her car insurance\n3. We observe that it is assumed in the question that Jessica paid $3,000 per month for food, $1,00 for her rent, and $200 per month for car insurance.\n4. We see that last year, Jessica was paying $3,00 plus $1,00 plus $200 plus $10 for the rent, food, and insurance in that order.\n5. Now, we see how much each of these elements would be added together if Jessica was paying at the same rates as last year, $3,00, $1,0, $200, and $10 per month.\n6. Using last years expenses as our guide, we understand that the costs will be:\n\nJessica spent $3,600 per month\n\n7. Now, we see that her expenses in 2021 are increasing over 30%, 50%, and 200%.\n\nJessica will spend $4,930 per month on rent, food, and cost of insurance.\n\n8. Using Jessica's rates in 2020 as our guide, we see that her total expenses this year is $1,8319 more than last year.

{"text": "1. There are 8 beakers with Copper ion, and 22 beakers without have them. So there are 30 beakers in total.\n2. Beakers with copper ione are 8, so the total that need to be tested is 30-8= 22.\n3. With adding three drops, 45drops is added all together. So with 22 beakers, 45/22= 2 so 2 beakers will need 3 drops to turn blue.\n\nThe total number of beakers need the three drops are 2+2= 4.\n\n4. We subtract 4 from 30 to get number of beakers that need to be tested to find one without copper ions, 30-4=26.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. The first thing you have to consider is the total number of beakers. We already know there are 22 beakers.\n2. Add to the total number of beaker with copper ion, then subtract the number without them with the total number to get the quantity to be used in testing.\n3. The answer we are looking for is the number of un-copper-ion beakers. We multiply the quantity to be used to be tested by the amount used to have the whole beakers blue.\n4.

Choices:  A:\"The train is not really that small.\" B:\"The train is quite big.\" C:\"The train is still small.\" D:\"It isn\u2019t that big\" E:\"It\u2019s really quite big\"\nRationales:1. We need to understand that the context talks about a train being small, so all options should be a variation of that.\n2. The options: A,B, and E seem to be too large as it talks about a train which was small initially.\n3. A phrase \"it isn't that big' doesn't make sense and has no options after it as in English it implies a negative comparison to big. For example: It's not that big. So option D doesn't fit the context.\n4. The phrase \"The train isn't that big, so they still ride with my children. Doesn't fit the context because it's describing the train as big when we're told it's small.\n5. Therefore I believe that we're looking for B or C to fit the context because they both imply that the train is small but not really tiny.

Choices: 1. A: four years ago B: twenty years ago C: two years ago D: thirty years ago E: ten months ago\nRationales:\n1. The question is, \"what is the amount of time from my birthday to now.\"\n2. There are 12 months in a year, each month has 30 days, and each day has 24 hours, so there are 12 * 30 * 24 or 730400 hours in a year.\n3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 730420 minutes in a year. \n4. There are 6 minutes per month to the day, so there are 219096 minutes per month. \n5. A \"year ago\" would be 12 months ago, or 12 * 60 min per hour * 219000 min per month. For example, 3 years ago would be 12 * 2 * 60 * 60 *21900 = 3433600 minutes.\n6. You can convert to hours like so: 3433000/1000 = 37013.3 hours ago.\n7. This is not a decimal, but a float, so you need to round the number. A common approach is to divide by 100, which would yield a decimal value of 0.370133, and then convert to a float.\n8. A float may start with any values after the decimal point, such as 0.\n9. So now you have a float value such as 3.701 for our example.\n10.

The metric and the imperial system are two separate scales which are used to measure quantities within our environment. They are very different in how they are specified and thus do not match perfectly when compared.\n4. When compared to the metric system of measurements, the imperial system of measurements does not provide an exact conversion scale.

The question does not involve other context such as a subject, prepositions etc. so we cannot pick this from the sentence.4. The sentence may not contain the answer.5. The sentence is written from a first person point of view, meaning we are writing and asking for the response. Therefore the answer must not also be in the first person because that would be redundant.6. Finally we know that we are on the road which is the place we are asking the other person to send the package to, so we want the answer to contain information about us being on the road.7. The answer must be a verb phrase. The word 'I' is a pronoun and can only be used within a verb phrase.8.

To find the cost of one bunch the total cost of both quantities needs to be determined. The cost of $23 for Tony is to buy twice the number of apples as Arnold. Similarly, the cost of $20 is to buy twice the apples as Arnold. Therefore the cost of a bunch bananas is a third of the total cost. This is why it is $33 cereal in total to two bunches of bananas.\n\nThis is a valid approach to answer the question, as 3 apples with 4 bananas is a 3rd of 2 dozen apples.\n\n#### If statement #1: I think that this is not valid since there is no way an apple can be bought twice.\n\n#### If else statement #2: I think that this would also work as well.

The 27 pounds subtracted from it leaves 9 pounds.\n\n### Rating 3:The dress has a wholesale price of 9 pounds.\n### Rationales:\n1. Retail Price=Wholesale price*(1+80%)=36+24*80%=52.8= 53.50\n2. Rational - The retail price of the shirt is $53.50.\n3. Calculation - 53.5 * 100% = 47 % of the dress.\n4. Rational - The seller has a profit of 47%.\n5. Calculation - 76 pound / 1% = 7600 / 100 = 76.\n6. Rational - The 80% profit is equal to the additional margin of 24%.\n7. Calculation - 80 * 24 / 100 * 76\n8.

This instruction can be read as\nInput: James buids x for BUY ONCE GET ONE FREE  Purchase: 20 lbs   How much does he pay?\n\n### Demostration:  The initial 'how much did he pay' should be changed to 'How much does he pay'.   Since 'how' is asking how much and then James is not even done yet so we need to change 'did' to 'does'.   'How much does he pays' is wrong so we change it to 'How much does James pay'.  \n\n### Demestration:  Purchase - how this word can be read as 'how much he buys' and 'how he buys it'.  \n\nSo with this in mind we can come to the answer 'Buying : 20 pounds.   How much does he buy: 20 pounds'.   The sentence is incomplete still.  \n\n#### Solution:\nLet's change 'the steams' to 'the steaks', so the initial sentence is:\nInput: James by steaks for buy one gets one.

{"text": "Harrison only buys a croissant once per month. We need to find how much he pays for each month. We will use a monthly average of $6.15 for the croissants, since he only buys them twice per month. In a year, there are 12 months and Harrison spends $6.15 per month, which equals $74.80.\n\n### Explaination:The question says that Harrison buys a regular croissants and an almond croissants on Saturdays and Sundays, respectively. Whenever on a weekend Harrison buys a croissant, he pays $5.50 for almond croissant and $3.50 for a regular croissant. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, Harrison buys a total of 104 croissants. However, the price is the same in each one of the 104 croissant; thus, in total, he pays $545.80 (104 x $5.50) for the almond croissants. We need to find the total price he pays for all the 104 regular croissants. We can start solving this problem by multiplying 52 by 0.125 (which is 0.50/4; since 52 weeks in one year there are 4 of them on each month), because he only buys one regular croissant a month. As a result, the number of regular croissants he buys in a year is 6.125 (52 x 0.1225) and the price of each regular croissant in a year is $3.50 x 6.1225, which is $20.5625. Hence, he pays $20.5825 for regular croissants in a whole year. Now we subtract the $20.5325 from the $545.3825 total price he gets for buying 104 almond croissants, which results in $325.8525 as the total spent for the croissants.", "answer": " 468"}

{"text": "30 hours\n\n### Explanation:Let's consider the first part of the given statement.If Jeff spends three times as much time on the weekend then he does working, that means,\n\n|Weekend |Working Week|\n|:------:|:----------:|\n|3       | 1           |\n\nAnd now considering the second part of the given statement, that is if he spend 4 times as much time working as doing so on his weekends.\n\nIn order to solve it, we will first consider that,\n\n|Weekday|Working Week|\n----------------\n|4      | 2           |\n\nNow, as we get both the results, we will compare them \n\n**Comparing the results**\n\nFor weekend part, Jeff is working for 4 hours(working week) and then again he is working an extra time for 3 hours and this extra time is 3*4 = 12 hours. So sum of weekend working hours = 4+12 = 16 hours. 16/7 = 2 and 3/7 = 0. On weekend, he is working for 8 hours every day. So, 2 times in a weekend, he will spend 16 hours and in the remaining 5 days he will work for 12 hours = 60*1/7 = 8.4 hours a day. So altogether, he will spend 84 hours on weekend.\n\nFor weekdays part, Jeff is working as usual for 4 hours. Then his extra time for 4 times = 4*4 = 16 hours =1 hour for 16 days in a week. For the remaining, he will work for 8 hours = 64 hours = 8.4*4 = 33.6 hours. So altogether, he is working for a total time of 47.6 hours in a week.(1.Extra hour taken is only for 2 days of week)(3.Hour remaining taken in entire week is 3/7 =0.428571)\nLet's consider the entire week,he is working for 47.6 + 84 = 131.6 hours.\nDivide by 7, he spent 131.7/7=", "answer": " 62"}

{"text": "Alyssa and Abby should collect 30 more cans. To arrive at this, we assume and simplify the problem such that Abby collects more cans since the first statement of the question already indicated Alyssa collected less cans. This further simplifies the problem to a combination of numbers. We can now determine that Alyssa should have collected 60 cans while Abby should have collected 83 cans. Deducing Alyssa and Abbys combined number of empty cans, that equates 60 plus 83 (143), we can see that the answer is 143.\n\n### Rationale:\n* Assume that Alyssa has the most empty cans out of both of them.\n* Alyssa's total is 30, Abby's cans is a minimum of 43 and Abigail's total is a minimum of 73.\n\n## Input: The word bank for this test contains the following words: bicycle, cat, dog, car, boat, bed, house, tree\n\n## Response:\n\nSelect the correct synonym of the given word based on the context in the question.\nbicycle-vehicle\ndog-mammal\ncat-mammal\nboat-vehicle\ncar-vehicle\nbed-object\nhouse-building\ntree-plant\n\n### Rationales:\n* The first word is the root.\n* All of the words in the word bank share only the same first letter.\n* The root word has a vowel.\n* The word with the same vowel is the selected synonym.\n* The only correct choice does not have the same vowel.\n* It is easy to distinguish the selected word from the wrong answers.\n\nInput: What did Alyssa do?\n\n### Answer:\n* Alyssas verb phrase was did.\n* The root was can be used as the key to the answer.\n* All of these words from our word bank start with the same letter.\n* A synonym of do is did.\n* Alysas verb phrase was can be used to determine the answer.\nAnswer: Alyssas verb was was did.\n\n# Output:A: 3x + 5", "answer": " 27"}

{"text": "1. The sentence \"Her older sister was born in '1936'\" gives the number 1936 as a clue for solving the calculation. Therefore, the year Connie's grandmother would have been born can be calculated as 2 times 1936 + 1, or 8 + 1 = 9.\n2. Another way to solve is to consider that the sentence contains \"and the gap between her grandma and her sister\". The phrase \"gap between her grandma and [the person]\" can refer to a relative of that person.\n3. Therefore, \"gap\" refers to a calculation. We can reason that the \"gap\" refers the difference, like that from 1936 to 8, which would then mean the \"gap\" is 2 times as much, 8 (gap from 7 to 8) + 1 or 9. Therefore, Connie's grand-mothers older sister was born in the year \"1936\" and the answer to the question is \"9\" year gap between the grandmothers and grand-daughter.\n### Answer:1936 -> 9 -> 8 + 1\n### Rationales:\n1. The context was \"the gap between her grandmothers and her sister\" so if we consider a \"gap\" as a number, then the gap is a number of difference between two numbers.\n2. The numbers in the sentence are:\n3. The answer for the question is 1936 ->8 +1 because her sister is born in 1996,and we know that it's twice of the gap between \ngrandmothers and their older brother which is 1932 -> 9 - 1 and it's easy to calculate because it's twice of 9 which is 18 (9 - 1), and  18+ 1 is 19 and 19 -1 is 18 so it's easy to do because we know that the younger ones go before them.\n### Example solution:\n1.

Rose's purchase was $350 including the $150 for the pair of shoes and the $200 for the two decks of basketball card. This means that the price of the cards is $100.\n\n### Detailed Rationales\n1. We see the word pair. We know that it means two or a group of two. Also, the sunglasses and the shoes are each listed, which means they are also pairs. Mary bought two pairs, Rose bought two pairs.\n\n2. Next, we understand that they paid the same amount of money and both bought presents. Mary and Rose both bought presents. That's a total of $300.\n\n3. The third clue is that the pairs of sunglass and shoes cost the same amount of money, Mary and Rose spent the same amount of money. We know that this means they spent $300. We can also say that the total spent is $300. This is our third clue. (Based on prior clues, we understand that the fourth clue, the answer to the question, is not about sunglasses or shoes, but a pair of cards. We cannot answer the question based on prior clues.)\n\n4. In the fourth clue, the first clue indicates that Mary bought two pairs of glasses for $50. The second clue tells us Rose bought the pair of shoes for $150. The third clue is we know they spent the same amount of $300 together. We now know the total cost of all items is $450.\n\n5. Therefore, the answer should the third clue should be related to the fourth clue. From logic, we can find two sets to check. For example, the fourth clue is either the first set ($50 * 2) 50 x 2) = $100) or the second set (50 + 150 = 200). We want to rule out the second as we have not used this set.\n\n6. 50 x 300 = $15,000 \n\n7. So the", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "The vampire needs to survive by sucking 7 gallons of *Blood* (7 Gal) a week and if he sucks 2 *Pints of Blood* (2 Pin) per person he needs to suck on 2 *(people)* (2 Pin) *pints of blood* (2 Pin) in order to survive.\n\n### Rationale: The question above asks vampires to suck 7 *gallons* of blood a week, but gives 2 *pints* as the amount of blood he needs to suck from each person. We must convert gallons into pints, or the quantity in pints into gallons by dividing. We convert 7 gallons to pints using the formula:\n\n 7 Gallons = 7/16 Pints = 4.46 Pints\n\nThe final 2 equations we are left with are:\n\n  7 Gallons / 4.46 pints = ~ 1.6 Pints / Person\n\n  2 Pints / 1.63 people = 1.25 pints / person\n\nBecause we are looking for the final answer in pints of blood, we now have a ratio in pints of blood based on the number of people on how many pints of blood the vampire needs to intake.\n\nTo find the answer to the question, we have the equation:\n\n   1.6 Pints/Person X ______________ ______________ = 7 Pints\n\nWe now plug in 2 people, as we are told that we need 2 pints from each person, which is 4 pints when we multiply 1.6 by 2. We now have 4 pints in our equation, which now allows us to easily see that we need a total of 4 people per day to satisfy our vampires diet needs. In order to simplify it even further, we use the value 1.6 and multiply it by 4 to reduce the equation to:\n\n   6.4 Pints X ______________ = ______________\n\nWe are now looking for the number of people to satisfy the vampire, not the number of pints in gallons, so we divide by 4 and the equation reduces to:\n\n   16 Pints X _________", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "60\n\n#### Demonstration:  We begin by re-arranging the sentence to solve for the price: flower > clay pot - $20 + soil - $2.  This simplifies to Soil + clay pot + flower = flower price.  So we just need to work out the flower price of $9 and we know the flower price = pot price + soil price.  If flower price is $9, pot price is pot + flower and pot price is flower + pot.  So pot price + flower price = flower price.  Subtracting pot price from both sides gives us flower price = 9 + flower price.  Plugging in soil price = soil + flower price = flower and we can solve for flower price, which is $9. Adding soil price $2 < flower price and $9 + soil price $2 < pot price flower price + soil price, we can find that it cost $60 to plant the flowers.\n\n#### Rationales: 1) We begin by re-writing the sentence for clarity.\n2) We then solve for the price: Soil + claypot + flower = price of flower\n\n3) The question asks for the price = price of flower = Soil + clayp. + flower = 9\n\n\n4)  The first of the four clues is flower price = flower price + soil price. Soil + clay p. + flower = flower price\n5) Now, clayp + flower = flower price + flower price so clayp + flower + clayp. = price of flower + flower\n\n6) Subtracting clay p. from both sides of the equation gives flower price = Soil + flower + flower so flower price = Soil and flower price = pot price. \n\n7) Then flower price = 9 so pot price = pot + flower price (9)\n\n8) clay p. + pot price + pot = flower price. \n\n9) So now clay p. + (soil + flower price) + (soil + pot) = flower price. 10) Subtracting soil from clayp. + soil + Soil from flower price + Soil from pot price = Soil + Soil from clay p. \n\n1) Now, clay p. + soil + (soil +", "answer": " 45"}

In the previous review I over-interpreted each image. I did not pay attention to the text accompanying each question, which held a lot of helpful information. Instead of giving a list of bullet proofed concepts, I should instead focus on teaching a strategy that would work for all questions, along with providing tips for interpreting questions.\n\n#### Question2:\nI realized that I needed to give more specific and actionable advice and examples. I had given several pieces of advice pertaining to one particular question, but these were very vague and did not translate across questions to be applied to other questions. I also added an image along with the text to help give students an idea of what I thought a sample answer would look like.\n\n#### Question3\nI realized that the images I included for question 3 were not helpful, the answer was clear based on the question's prompt and instructions.

First, I will eliminate any option that is incorrect so that only one possible option remains. \nThen, I will determine the most likely choice amongst the options that remain. \nHere's a walkthrough to explain:\n\nFirst, we can eliminate any of the options that are not likely to be the answer.  For example, we know that burgers and french fries are both food.  Therefore, either option D or E would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, either burgers or french fries is an incorrect answer, leaving option B as the only viable possibility.  The reason I choose to eliminate rather than to eliminate-then-choose is related to speed - you may choose \"eliminate-then-choose\" only if you are confident that you've found the correct answer.  Alternatively, you may choose to start with the initial question and proceed from there, knowing that you'll need to make the cut somewhere in the process.\n\nAnother case may be that there could be more than one answer, or there could be no \"correct\" answer.

The sentence mentions \"there was a very nice table\" this means that there was always a table, it did not come and go. The sentence refers to a specific tree outside. The table is outside of the house, meaning that it is nearby. The dog is also inside of the house. The story implies that the dog does not sleep indoors.

To figure out the volume of the aquarium, I first draw a quick sketch the aquarium.\n5. After doing a quick sketch, I realize that the aquarium looks pretty tall compared to being 3 feet tall. So, I realize that the volume must be close to $10~5~^4~$ (12 x 11 x 12)\n6. I figure out that the total volume is 9 feet of water.\n7.

First, I am given information: Nancy fills an aquarium halfway, then spills half, then re-fills.\n2. This is information I need to consider.

The word booked is used to imply that Hans is in the room, therefore the sentence does not imply that more than 1 person is in the room. Also the sentence is specific regarding Hans and his room therefore it cannot include other guests in this context.\n2. Because there are no other guests means all the rooms at the hotel are available to Hans.\n3. An accident to the last floor is unrelated to the hotel, therefore the room that was occupied is unrelated to the room that Hans is in.\n4.

'In an office, you should work' contains the phrase 'you work in an office', this indicates that the listener will be working in the office as part of the sentence, therefore this phrase is the main point or idea of the sentence. 3. The phrase has multiple functions, as it implies that the speaker is providing direction or advising someone. 4. The speaker is expressing a personal feeling or attitude and is sharing it to the listener, this is referred to as an 'Opinion' phrase which is why the speaker is sharing it with the listener. 5. The speaker is showing a sense of self-belief and confidence with their advice, which is why they are sharing this with the listener as it will be impactful. 6.

There are two possible groups within this category (those public transportation and those who walk to work).  The first group (those taking public transportation) has 100 employees (60% of 200).  This means the second group (those who walk to work) is larger than that, since those who take public transportation is NOT that many (100).

What will be the price of 0.8kg of apples if the same rule is maintained?\n\n### Response : The price of 0.1kg of apples would be 0.8 x 1 = 0.8 euro.\n\n### Rationales: 1 This problem is dealing with the concept of a variable which can be defined as one value or many.\n2. Variable is a symbol used when dealing with numbers which can express different things or change their values.\n3. One kg weighs 1,000  grams. So an apple of 0.8 kg weighs around 800 grams according to the unit system.\n4. We know that the unit price of an apple is \u20ac1 and that an apple weighing 0.8kg weighs 800g.\n5. We can form the equation: x = 1 and x = 800g; we can substitute: 0.1 x 1 = \u20ac1 and 0.1 800g is equal to x.\n6. The answer is 0.1 x \u20ac1 = \u20ac0.1", "answer": " 100"}

I suppose there is no 10:30, since there is 9:09 which means 2 minute less then 10:09. So it is either 8:00, 9:00 or 9:09. We can eliminate '10:09' from the options because of 9:09 option.\n5.

{"text": "Jar C has 36 more marbles than jar B. There are 36+28=64 marbles altogether.\n### Rationales:\n1. It is important to understand the meaning of the question. Specifically, which is better: understanding the meaning of the question, or applying the knowledge you already have? There has to be a balance between these two.\n2. The question is asking for a quantity of marbles which is given to us in three separate quantities.\n3. These quantities are in a specific order, where each new quantity is always the next larger value in the sequence.\n4. First, it is given that \"jar A has 28marbles\" and \"jar B has 12more marbles than jar A.\"\n5. This means that jar B has 12marbles more than jar A.\n6. This implies that jar A has 12less marbles than jar B, and jar B has 11less marbles than jar A, and so on.\n7. As we progress from jar B to jar C, the quantity of marbles increases by a factor of 2, where each jar has one more.\n8. As a consequence, jar C has 24 (or two factors higher) than jar B, which will be our starting point for figuring out how many marbles there are in total.\n9. Now we will multiply the marbles in jar B by two, and add the marbles in jar A on each side.\n10. Doing this will give us the amount of marbles jar C has, by including all of the marbles jar B and all the marbles jar A.\n11. We can do this using the mathematical phrase (24+28).\n12.

This means that Kate's apples and oranges *cannot* be equal.\nThus, we are not required to find the total number of apples Bill has, only to find how many more oranges Kate has than Bill.\n\nIf we take the statement, \"In all 50 more apples than Kate,\" and combine it with the previous statement, we find 2 solutions:\n\nBill has `15` apples.\nKate has `75` apples. \n\nThus, we can see that our equation is `Kate=Bill+50.Kate=15+50.K`\n\nThe question then states that Bill has *half* as many apples as Kate.\nThus, `Bill=Kate+25`. \n\nTherefore, we can combine these equations and eliminate Kate so that we are left with \n`.5(Bill+50)+25=(Bill)(0.5+25).5(15)+25=12.5`.\nThus, Bill has `12.5` apples.", "answer": " 20"}

Choices: 1)1.25 2) 9/4 3) 1.333 4) 9.25 5) 9.2\nRationales:1. First we need know what Dora's age is.\n2. Dora being 3/4 of another person's age means that Dora can be easily worked out if we know another person's age.\n3. We know that Dora is 3/4 of age and that the age the other person is refers to (9 years). We can now replace 'others age' with 9 years.\n4. Dora was 3 times 1/4. We can change 1/4 to 0.25.\n5. 3 x 0.25 = 0.75\n6. Therefore Dora was 7.5 years old.\n7. To work out the answer we multiply Dora's age by 4.\n8. Dora was 7 years old multiplied by 4.\n9. There are 4 quarters in a full year.\n10. Adding a quarter increases the year by a quarter.\n11. Therefore if Dora is multiplied by 4 years, we can add 4 quarters.\n12. Dora has been multiplied by 4 and we got 20.\n13. A quarter added to 20 gives us 23.\n14. So the answer to the question is Dora is 23 years old.\n\n### Worksheet question:\n- 1.

If the shop gave a 15% discount, she'll get $150 more money.\nAnswer:\nMrs. Smith can't by things because she only brought $500 dollars. She needs $1550 but only has $500.\n\n1. We start by solving the equation.\n4. We can simplify it by dividing both sides by $500. This shows the new dollar amount after dividing\nboth sides by $50 will be $.\n\n5.

In order to choose the option closest in length, the class will first need to determine the value of 144 inches and then compare the relative lengths of the given options. To begin, John should tell the children that 144 inches is exactly the same as 12 feet. In other words, 12 feet is equal to 144, so they can just look at the following question \n\nWhich of the options is closest in length than 12 feet?\n\nLet's look at which of the options are closest in length to 36 inches: Choose A: three B: four C: five D: six E: one month\n\nBecause 12 feet is closest to 36 inches, the same logic is applied to the 144 inch question. When you look at the length of each option in the question, you will notice that 144 is closest to six feet. Therefore, the choice closest in length is E: one month.", "answer": " 265000"}

Zhang is as old as Li. Input: Zhang twice as older than Li as Li is 5.  Zhang 40 years old and Li is 20.\nRationales: We considered all the input variables carefully. First of all, Zhang's brother can only be Jung if the previous sentence was correct. The statement \"Zhang is 12 years of age\" does not make logical sense if Zhang is older than 12 years and the statement \"Li is 12 year\" of makes logical sense for the same reason. This means that the sentences are either correct or incorrect but not both.\nTherefore, if they were wrong, the sentence cannot be correct, which means that we can assume only three of the input statements are correct (in which case it remains unknown which exactly).\n1. If the sentence \"Zhang is twice as older than Li\" is correct, which means that \"Zhang is twice the older as Li\" then using simple math Li must have been 12 years old for Zhang to be double the age, which means Zhang must be 24 years old which gives Jung to be 25 years old.\nNote that this does not take into account Jung being older than Zhang.\n2. If \"Zhang twice as older than Lilly\" is incorrect then Zhang must be older than Li (by a factor of 2), which means Li must be old and Zhang is either 24 or 25 years old which gives Jung the age of 25.\n3. If Zhangs' brothers name is Jung, he is 26-27 years old which means he must have been born 2-3 years after Zhang.\n4. If Zhang and Li are not related to Jung, which means the brothers name must be Jung, he is either 24 years or 25 years of age.\n\nIn conclusion, Jung is 25 years old and the sentence is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: Zhang is twice older than Li as Li 12 years of Li is 12.\nZ", "answer": " 26"}
{"text": "The denominator or number of red caps is 50, and the numerator, which is green caps, is 125. The green caps is already out of the 50 red caps. But when you calculate, you'll get 62.5%. The answer is 25%.\n\n### Rationales: The context of the question doesn't contain any other information such as the number of bottles, the number of red caps, and number of green caps in each bottle.\n1. If we consider Ali, this refers to a person and not to the bottle caps.\n2. We are given the options of \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" but we also need to consider the context of the problem. The context makes us consider the word \"caps,\" which refers to the small plastic piece on the top of a bottle to seal it closed.\n3. We know that Ali is collecting bottle \"caps,\" which implies he has 125 total bottle caps in total. From there, we see that the question is asking about the colors of Ali's bottle caps.\n4. Considering the options, we can't deduce any information about Ali's bottle. Therefore, we consider the bottle caps and use all the information we are given.\n5. For the first choice, red, we know 50 from the context of the problem and the first option.\n6. We know Ali has a total of 125 bottles and we know of 125 total caps so if 50 are red, that leaves 75 left to be green.\n7. This calculation brings the answer to be 62.5 but the question is asking for a percentage. To get this, divide by the total number (125) and then multiply by 100.

It just takes that for Tina to clean her assignment with 14 keys left.\n```\nThe total time it will take for Tina to finish her homework with 14 keys and start working on her homework is 1 (remainder) + 45 (total time Tina clean the 15) = 45 (total) + 1 (remainderr) = 46 minutes.\n```\nI think that it might take 50 minutes which is equal to 3*50. That is the time it takes to clean the 14 keys. It's equal to that of the 15 because there are 1 key and 15-1 = 14 remaining keys.\n\n\n### Input The first step is determining it take five minutes to pick the keys off of the keyboard.\n\n\n## Input What do the numbers in the parentheses at the end of each box and sentence represent?\n### Demonstraition I've marked numbers in the parentheses that represent the page number of the book from which the information comes.

Each batch of recipe calls For 4 potatoes and one teaspoons of salt. A potatoes Costs 10 cents and a container of salt Costs 2 at supermarket. If each containers of salt Has 5 teaspoon, How much money will Susan spend On food?\nRationales:\n1. The first thing we need to understand is exactly what Susan is planning. To throw a party for her mother, she is planning on having 20 guests who will all need to be fed dinner.\n2. After determining whether the number of guests is the same number as servings of the recipe, next we need to consider the total expenditure of each guest.\n3. For every guest, dinner requires a batch of the recipe. Each batch makes 2 servings, so two batches are required to feed each guest.\n4. The cost of an ingredient is $X a dollar, and the amount supplied is Z. Then the total amount of a needed ingredient is the recipe's specifications divided by the cost. So, the total amount of cost is: Total Cost = Recipe's Specifications - Cost\n5. After applying this formula, let' write down each of the values of the equation. The total number of guest is 30, 2 servings are created per batch, 4 are needed per batch. The recipe calls for 1 teaspoons of each ingredient, there are 5 teaspoops in a container of salt and each container has a cost of $2. The answer can be written in the form of:\n\n$Cost = 30 \u22c5 2 \u22c5 4 \u22c5 1 \u22c5 5 \u22c5 2 - $2\n$$Cost = 30 \u00d7 2 \u22c5 8 \u00d7 1 \u22c5 25 \u00d7 2 - 2$$\n$$Cost = 2400 - 2$$\n\n$$Cost = 0.056 $$\n\n\n### Credit\n\n* Ninth grade students, [Math for the Liberal Arts (MLA)](https://mathematicsforliberalarts.com)", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "The flag pole broke at its midpoint, and the breakpoint is at 6 feet.\n\n### Reason:\nConsider the height of a person when viewing a flagpole. The flagpole is measured in feet while the height of the person is measured in centimeters.\n\nThe base of a person is akin to the base of the flagpole, whereas one half of the person is similar to the midpoint of the person.\n\nSimilarly, half of the height of a flagpole is equivalent to the height of a person.\n\n12 ft is half the height of the flagpole, and that height is the height of the person.\nSince we assume that the base of the person and the base of the flag pole is the same, the two flagpoles will break in the same way, and both will break at a quarter of their height.\n\nSince both flagpoles are broken at a quarter of their hight, the two flagpolos must now have two different heights, the flag pole that breaks must fold in half and the other must not, therefore the height of both flagpoles will now be double the height of the original flagpole.\n\nThe original height of the pole was 12 feet, and we already calculated the other half because it did not break, leaving the original flagpole with half its original height. That original flagpole had a height which is equal to its new height. \n\nThe original flagpole had a talless 12 feet, but we know that as it broke, its height will now have its initial and final flagpole height. \n\nSince its initial flagpole height was 12, its final flagpole height is 6. The two flagpoles broke at half the height of the original poles, but now its new height is equal to its previous height.\n\nThe two flagpoles broke one inch apart because that is the difference between the height of the entire flag pole and the height at its mid point.\n\nTherefore, we know that the height of the first flagpole is double the height of its midpoint.\n\nSince we know that its height is double its midpoint, we know that half of that is four.

{"text": "$18  \n\n#### Rationale: The question asks how much John spent on pins given the information provided. We first need to understand the information provided so that we know what the context of the problem is.\n\n#### Step 1 - Understand the question\n\nThe question is phrased as asking \"How much did John spend on pins?\"\nThe question is in effect asking the answer to the equation $10 \u00d7 15% =? \nIn this context, the question is therefore asking how much John spent on 10 pins if they were on sale for (10 \u00d7 100% * 15%) \u2248 $18 per pin. When solving the above equation, it is easier to first set up a new equation to solve by multiplying both sides by 10 so we have, $10 \u00d7 5 = 50  15 % of 50 is equivalent to $5 per pin  \n\n#### Step 2 - Understand the context\n\nJohn has $100 and is looking to buy one of three products, pins, shampoo or bread. The prices of the three products is as stated in the question.\nTherefore, the answer must be either a percentage or a quantity.\n\n#### Step\n\nIf we assume the answer is a quantity, then John can either buy 30 pins, 25 shampoos or 33.3333 breads.\n\nHowever, if we assume the answer is percentage, it is known that John can only afford 4 pins at $10 each, leaving him with $20. This does not answer the question and is not a possible option. Therefore the answer is a quantity.\n\nIf we assume $18 is the answer, we know that this is a multiple of $20 as each of the products costs $20.\nHowever if we assume the answer cannot be a multiple of $25 as then John would not be able to buy 6 shampoos and 2 pins.\n\nIf we therefore remove all quantities divisible by 5 from our options leaving only 3, 5 and 10, and if we assume the answer $18 is divisible by 5, then $18 is divisble by 3, 5, and 10.

{"text": "(a) First, ask how much he eats and how many pieces he eats in the first day. So let p = pieces eaten on day one. We can write it as (p + 2)(p + 2) = P(8 + 2), which we can clear the parentheses by multiplying them by 8 and 2 to get (8p + 16p + 16)(8 + 2). Simplifying we get 3(48p + 32) = 228 so (p + 2)^2 + (p + 2) + 48p + 228 = p so p = 8 so you eat 8 pieces on day one.\nThis is all you really need to know to get p = 8. You can ask the next day the same question (p + p) and get p + 8 = 3 so p = 5.

{"text": "We first need to understand what the instructions are asking for.\n\n### Rationale:\nIn this problem, we must first calculate how many bananas there are overall, and then calculate how many bananas each hand in each pile has. Then, we can divide the bananas equally to find out how many bananas each monkey receives. We now must go to the first line of the instructions:\n\n> A family of 12 people collected 10 pizzas. 5 families had 9 children, with each child having 16 slices of pizza. A family of no children also collected 10 pies with their family.\n\nWe first think of a possible interpretation for the word \"pie\" rather than \"pizza\", since \"pizza\" refers to a food item in Italy, but we will ignore this difference, since the instructions are asking about the number of bananas per monkey. We can note that there are no numbers directly given in the \"instructions,\" rather, each line has one sentence before it. After this, we first find the number of people altogether. We find that there are 12 people, 10 piles, 6 piles with 9 people, and 4 piles with 12 people (we assume there are no 11 people). Then, we can also note that there are 6 piles of 9 baboons and 4 piles of baboons (this is the case because after each sentence, there is a \"number of monkeys\").\nSo we have now found that 12 families collected 10 pizza piles. Each pizza pile had 12, 9, 4, or 4 baboons, each with 14, 9, 9, 13, or 16 pizzas. Let us call a hand \"pizza.\" Next, we have found that there are 10 pizza \"piles\", with each pizza \"pile\" having six baboons. Each pizza has 9 or 14 of them (it's important to remember that there are no numbers in these instructions, only sentences, and this is why we found them by finding the total number and then finding how many of each baboon there are in each pile).\n\nSo now we have 6 piles of bab", "answer": " 99"}

The question is how many gumballs he had remaining from the purchase.\n\n2. There are multiple choices for how much gumball he purchased. These include a  container, dozen, 50 pounds, and 36 dozen.\n\n3. After considering the context, we can eliminate any options that are not the same size of container as the one Hector purchased, which means eliminating anything besides: \"a container,\" \"12 dozen,\" or \"a truckload.\"\n\n4. Next, we see Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd, and then twice as many to Alisha, so that means he has given 8 total.\n5. We know the he has 6 gumball remain, so Hector was left with a total of \"6+8 = 14 gumballs.\" \n\n6. So for the final step, we need to find the total number of gymballos he bought and multiply it by \"14\" to get the total number of gumbllos he bought.  \"6+8 =14\" \n\n7.

Here ABCD is a 45-45-90 triangle and is congruent to ADX, so the sum of interior angles ABCD = ADX = 180.\n\nSince AC is 10 longer than AB. If AB=8 cm and AC=18.\n\nAC(10) = AB + AB\n\n10 + 18 > 10.\n\nTherefore, AC(10) > AB + AB.\n\nThus, AC is longer than AB by 10cm.\n\nAC > AB.\n\nSince, AC = 11.\n\nAB + 10cm > 8cm\n\n11 +", "answer": " 59"}

{"text": "Ayla has a job of talking with customers and helping them solve their problems. She spends 1 hour a week of each 50 customers on the phone. We can estimate that each customer calls for an average of 1 hour of talking with Ayla (average), and the hourly charge is 5$. So, in a way, we can estimate how much money she spends in a day for each of the 50 customers.\n\n#### 1st week:Ayla takes 50 phone calls. Each call lasts 100 minutes (including the 1-minute pause between customers). Hence, the total number of minutes she spends on the phone in a day is 5 + 50 * 100 / 60 = 200 minutes.\n\n#### Second week: A similar calculation: 5 + 51 * 100/ (4 or 6) = 201 minutes\n\n#### And so on.\n\n#### Total number of minutes: 200 + 201 + 202 +...\n\n#### Total number days: 7 + 7 + 7...

If that is true, then the customers do not simply talk with Ayla for 1 hour, but are actually trying to get to solve their problems. Given that one customer takes 1 hour and the customer-per-minute cost is 5cents. \n3. If Ayla has 50 customers every week, then the cost of each call is 50 * (6min/ 5h) - The second 50-minute block of a customer who spends 25 minutes on the first call.

{"text": "69 square feet.\n\nRationales:\n1. The number 2 multiplied by itself is 4; thus, two square feet of paper is four square feet in all. As for the third present, it takes the same amount because it has \"the same amount as both\" of the other presents. The sum of the two other presents is 3+3, which adds up to six square feet.

People should eat the fruits and vegetables raw instead of cooked.\n\n### Response\nDear Ms. Lydia,\n\nThank you for giving me a great idea with your prompt, I absolutely enjoyed doing this activity, especially when I got to the 5th question, the one that I did the \"science experiment.\"\n\n### Firstly, we started by dividing the sentence itself, into the 3 parts, to be able to get a better understanding:\n\nInput:  --> The main components of a persons diet are meats (meat) \n               , vegetables, (veggie) \n                and fruits, (fruit) \n\nOutput:  --> Vegetables is part of a persons diet (vegetable)\n                Vegetables should be eaten raw (vegetable) \n                Fruits should be eaten raw to maximize nutrients (fruit)\n\nAfter extracting the information for each component of a persons diet, I realized that there was one word that kept repeating, which was the word \"or\" with the exception of the word \"fruit\". There was a repetition of the word \"raw\" also; for instance, fruits should be eaten (or) raw, vegetables should be eaten (raw), etc...\n\n##### Next, we tried to categorize/ classify the words from each component and we came up with the following classification:\n\n##### Nouns (meat, fruit, vegetable) and Adverbs (raw).\n\n##### Then, we started trying different combinations, for instance:\n\nInput: The 3 main components of a person\u2019s diet are meat (meat) or Fruit, vegetables, and Fruits should be (vegetables and fruit). If you are unsure which the case is, then assume it is the first option and it will be (meat).\n\nOutput: Veg", "answer": " 220"}

By purchasing those books, he spent it all so it's worth checking if the answer is 0.\n2. There is nothing left on hand he could use to buy another book.\n3.

{"text": "211. Martha should go to the farmer's market 200 times. She should go 2 times and buy 4 of any package of berries for $3 each. This is $3*4= $12. Then the next time at the market, Martha should buy an even number of berries. If she chooses to buy 2 berries and the cost is $3 for each berry, that is $2*2= $4. If she chooses not to buy as much berries, that\u2019s $12 minus the amount of berries she bought. If the cost is $12*2= $24.

We can solve this by starting by buying a total of 4 berries for the total cost of $3 to start.\n- She then has to buy another 4 berries for $5 later. The next time she needs to pick up a different color berry which has a cost of another $3.\n- She will need 2 berries for the next purchase because that\u2019s how many she would get if she bought an even number for $3. The cost for each berry is the same and they all cost the same.\n- Using similar numbers with the next two amounts for blueberry ice cream is $24 dollars for 4 and $12 dollars for 2. For the raspberry ice creams $5 dollars for 4 and 2.\n- To make each flavor she will need the same amount of berries for them both.\n- If she can\u2019t make 1 quart of  each flavor than one flavor will be worth more than", "answer": " 20"}

Choices:  A/the/an/zero:  a. garden B: kitchen C: bathroom D: living room E/the/an:  zero\nRationales: We first reviewed that whenever used is a conjunction to link clauses. Therefore, whenever should never be used inside a prepositional phrase. We also reviewed that whatever is a very informal word, is also an object pronoun. Therefore, whatever does not fit with the context because the given answer choices are about rooms and not things. We also reviewed whenever, and we learned that whenever does not start clauses. Thus, it fits the context as we can't substitute the word wherever, or we must place whenever or zero inside the blank. We also learned that whenever and every time are both adverbs. Therefore, whenever is not a verb which can only be used as a verb in the beginning when/until or after/while. We then learned that the/an/zero can be used for a single object pronoun. Therefore \"zero\" is the correct answer.  \n\nAnswer: the children always play in \"zero\"\n\n\n### Input- Question: Your friend says her family only shops at one of the bigger ____ stores in town.

We finally learned a phrase that fits the context and the definitions as ___ is a type of shop.

{"text": "Input: At Snowflake Plastic, each employee gets 20.\nRationales: After rephrasing the question, it becomes clear that the question requires some type of arithmetic. \n1. For this case, we can assume that the employee gets their entire allotment of both days.\n2. We can assume that each day is 8 hours long.\n3. It is not clear what an allotment \"covers\" and to what it refers, thus \"allotment\" cannot be a variable.\n4. Also, it is not clear what happens if they do not use their entire allowance.\n5. In this case, the employee will need to use half the allotment of both sick days and vacation days.\n6. Since sick days is an integer while vacation is not, we can assume that vacation is an unknown variable and allotment is an integer.\n7. Using addition we can get the following equations:\n8 hours \u00d7 the allotment of vacation days = the number of vacation days used in a year\n8 hours \u00d7 the number of vacation used in a year = 2 days' worth\n8 hours \u00d7 2 days' worth = the days used in a month\n8 hours \u00d7 4 days' worth = the allotment of sick days. \n8 hours \u00d7 3 days' worth = the number of sick days used in a year.\n8 hours \u00d7 The number of sick days used = the allotment divided by 4.\n7.5 hours \u00d7 the number of sick days \u00f7 4 = 1.75 days per sick day used. \n8. By rearranging the equations, we can determine that each day of vacation is worth 5 days' worth, and each day sick is worth 1.75 work days per day used.\n9. The amount of vacation and sick days left are: 8 hours \u00d7 5 days = 40 sick days, 8 hours \u00d7 1.75 = 14 work days' worth.\nTherefore, the answer is 54.5 work days' worth. \nAnswer: 54.5\n\n### Input \uff1aWrite a program that accepts a three-digit nonnegative integer n as input and computes and print the sum of its digits (10, 100,", "answer": " 80"}

Since the two numbers are separated by 2 digits, the ones digit must be subtracted from the ones digit of the first number. The digit on the right must be greater than the other, this can be seen in the first 2 numbers as 3 is greater than 1 and in the last 2 numbers 9 is greater than 2. As all the numbers are the same ones digit, this means that 9-1=8 is the right digit. We can also check that 3-2=1 and 9-2=7, all the answers are in ascending order.\nRationale for second question: Given the sum for all three numbers, we can see that 13+21+91=124, we add the smallest number to the largest in order to find what number they get to (1+2+9) 11. The digit that was left on this number is the one which is greater than the other, in this case it is 2, the right digit becomes 2.\n\n### Note :\n\n### Demonsoation:\nRational:\n1.

{"text": "**2 hours**. We are asked to find, by calculating the total number of pages, over what time can Mack have written them.\n\nIf we first calculate the total amount of time spent writing, we see that it equals 90 minutes. This is the total amount of time we have to fit 60 minutes on Monday, 45 on Tuesday, and 5 on Wednesday, so this represents the total amount of time over which these things occur.\n\nIf we then calculate the amount of time it takes to write each of these things relative to the total time spent writing, the results are the following:\n\nMonday: 60/90 = 66% of the total time spent writing\nTuesday: 45/90 = 50% of the total time\nWednesday: 5/90 = (5/90) = 5.55% of the total time.\n\nUsing this information we can construct the following pie chart:\n\n![pie chart](https://imgur.com/a/KZvJqGk.png)\n\n### Rationales:\n\nFirst we need to identify what information is missing from the question. The question gives us a formula to calculate the total number of pages written, as well as given the total time spent. However, we don't have any information on the duration of each task, so we use the formula to find out the time spent for each task and therefore the percentage of the total working time it takes up.\n\nThis information can help us to draw conclusions about the duration of each activity (in this case writing in the journal). We can also calculate the total amount of pages written by determining the total time spent writing and then multiplying it by the total amount of pages per unit of time. In this particular scenario the total time spent was 90 minutes, and the amount of pages per unit time was 1 page per 30 minutes, so the total number of pages was calculated to be 30 pages.\n\nAbove we have constructed a pie chart that illustrates the data we have been given, and further shows the conclusions that can be reached. The chart demonstrates how the total amount of time taken is 90 minutes, of which 66% is Monday, 50% Tuesday, and the other 5.", "answer": " 10"}

The remaining 140 (out of 250) had not played football and not liked football and 5 had not liked football and had not played football. So of these 140 who had not played football and who had not liked football, 70 (50% liked football and 5% had liked football and had not liked football) would have liked football and 70 had not liked football. Out of the 250 members of the group, we know that there were 24 that liked football and out of those 24, 11 had played football (being 50% of these 24 that liked it and had played it) and 5 had not (being 20% of the 24 that liked and had played football).

{"text": "She had her account with $55 in her pocket or bank account. She spent $15 with an outfit with $55 in the bag or account. She went to another shop and purchased $24. If the three times amount of the dress is $24, the $24 plus the $15 she had in her pocket. Then she had $39 in her account.\n\n### Explained below:\nInput:Lily had $995 in her account.\nShe spent $7.90 on her shirt.\nShe then went to another shop\nand spent 2 as much as she did on her shirt. \nHow much money is left in her account?\n\nDemonstration:The context of the sentence is a girl called Lily. The sentence states that she initially had $995.\nThe first step is to understand what a'spend' means in a mathematical context. \nThe option of money being'spent' in this sentence is the same as being deducted in a mathematical context. So the first step is to understand that $7.90 are being deducted from the account and what percentage this is to the account value. \nThis is easier to understand if we think about it in fractions. If you have $2.555, then taking away $7.90 is equivalent to multiplying the two options with the denominator.\nSo, $2.55 is the same as 2/5. In the same way, $7.90 can be converted to 7/5.\nSo, if we multiply the $995 by 7/5, we get $7.90. This value is already in the question and is equivalent to '2 as much' as the shirt. \nNow we consider the $7.90 in fractional terms. So, the original question of $995 is $995: $7.90 = $10. Now we can simply take away the $7.95 as it is a multiple of the account value. This gives us the answer $995 - $7.95 = $987.15.\n\nNote: this works as it is the same denominator for the 7/5 and the account. This can be useful to check your understanding.\n\n### Input", "answer": " 27"}

These 3 stories each contain 50 pages, which makes 150 pages of stories. Then, 'each year' refers to John's output at his current output rate. We note that this is an example of a 'worked example' where the output rate is given in the question and where we need to consider the output at the current rate and multiply the output rate by a constant to get the output value, therefore, we can then add the output value and output rate to give a total of 2.5 reams.\n\n### Inputs:\n**Input: The car factory is the world's biggest.

The car factory is the 'world's biggest', so A refers to the facility, not the efficiency of the machines.\n        2. Since the question also states that it is referring to the efficiency of the machines, we can then deduce B as the efficiency rate.\n        3. There are 6 machines with a 70% rate of efficiency. The context here is about the 'cars made by the machines', so we can then deduce that C (the number of cars made) is the output in response the machines.\n        4. Since the efficiency rate of the machines is 70%, if we take C, the number of cars they make, and this by 1.7, the efficiency rate, then we get C multiplied by 0.70 to obtain the value 109.2, as this is the number of cars they can make in each hour.\n        \n### Input:What is 1 times 0?

{"text": "### Instructions to answer\n \n\n#### Involve all the people in the solution process.\n \n\n**Solution:** I agree, we should look at this problem together. However, I think we need to do a little more math first to be able to arrive at a solution. I am sure we all do the same thing, we take 30, divide it by 6 = 5 with remainder 1. We then subtract 1 from 5 and obtain 4. Multiply 4 by 36, the number of days that are in a week, and we will know how many hundred deviled eggs to make. We divide 144 by 30 (people) to know how many dozen appeties we make each day. We repeat this process for the second half of the problem.\n\n#### How to improve \n> **Solution:** Please explain the steps you used to solve the problem and the result each step produced.\nI think it is easier to read this if we first get the answer for the first half, 30 appetities a day. As seen above:\n\nThen we need to know how many dozen deviled eggs will fill the amount required. Dividing what will become 30 appetites by 6, the amount of appetizeters per person. I get 5 with the remainder of 1.  I then subtract one from that (5-1) and arrive at 4. I multiply 4 by 30 to get 120 deviled eggs and rounding up to 122 eggs.\n\n#### Be honest and open about making mistakes.\n> **Solution**: It is acceptable to make mistakes on your first draft\u2014the important thing is that you write something down and share it with the team. Try to show the process you used to solve the question and the result. If you get stuck, ask someone for help.\n> **Answer**: I took your idea and tested a variety of ways to get the number of people by 30.

But, it is unclear how much water she pumps per minute.\n\nInput:That's because Lidia doesn't know it, so we solve it using basic algebra.\n\nInput:The pool leaks 0.1 gallon per minute.\n\nRationales:\n1.   First, we need to find out how many dogs Lidia has.\n2.   From context, it can be found out that she has 2 dogs.\n3. Then, we can find out how much they weigh, in order to find out how much water each can drink.\n4.   It can be found that: 60/20 = 3 gallons (20 in kilos/3 gallon = 7).\n5. Now, to find out how much Lidia pumps per minute, we can do basic algebra.\n6.   We know that the rate of supply (the hose) is 1.6 gallon per minute.  \n7. We don't know how much she pumps per minute, but we have an equation: \n8.   r (rate of supply) = 1.6     u (rate of demand) = u(60) = 0.1 (60 gallon leak)\n9.  So we get 1.6 = 0.1    60 = 0.1, so 60 \u00f7 0.1 = 600 (one hundered 60th)\n10. So, for each gallon that Lidia pumps in, the pool loses 0.1 (leaks, because the pool has a small hole).\n11. We get the following equation:\n12.   r (rate o supply) = 1 (we are keeping constant the rate of supply), \n13.     u (rate of supply) + (rate of supply) * u = 1 (constant rate of supply)\n15.

{"text": "Larry spends 105 minutes each day on his dog.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFirst, let's break this scenario into pieces. We have a subject, Larry, and three objects: his dog, eating and walking.\n\nFrom the sentence we have the following structure:\n\n\"Larry [walking or eating] [and his dog].\"\n\nWe also have two objects: his dog and feeding his dog.\n\nThe first object is \"feeding\" his dog, which is not an action that Larry has to do. Therefore it must be part of an action he's doing which include walking and playing with his dogs.\n\nAs there's no information to determine how many minutes Larry spends on dog walking and playing for one day, we must assume they spend the same amount of time together.\n\nFor dog feeding, which comes in every fifth of an hour, Larry spends \"one fifth\" of his dog time on dog feeding.\nIf we multiply these numbers, we get: \"One fifth\" of \"fifty-five minutes\" gives us \"ten minutes\" which is \"one fifth\" of \"100 minutes.\" Therefore, Larry spends 1/5 or 20 minutes each day feeding his dog, and 100 minutes each day playing with his dog and walking with his dog.\nHowever, that's not the answer provided by the question.\n\nIn the question, there's only one way you can spend 105 minutes on your dog, by feeding your dog.\n\nThus the answer must be C: 105 minutes:\n\nAnswer: C: 100 minutes + 15 minutes feeding\n\n### Input.

{"text": "Thor is 13 times as old than as Captain America. Let's say the current age of Captain America is x. We want to calculate the current age of Ironman = 1456+7x-32x. When we take the derivative of the left hand side, we get 1456=x+7x-33x. Therefore x=7x-180(x-1456). Thus, when x=1456, we get that the age of Ironman=7x-145.6. Since we want the age to be expressed in years, we solve x=7x -12x \u2248 x=.7x. Therefore, we can express Ironman = 13 times as older as Captain America+7 times older than Thor.

Choices:  A. 2 3 11 B. 3 3 5 11 13 C. 3 7 11 17 19\nRationales:\n1. The question is requesting the next five prime numbers up to 20.\n2. Whenever someone asks for prime numbers up to a number, you start with 2 and increment by 2 until you get to the number provided.\n3. \"Find the next five prime numbers\" does not tell you to start with any number other than 2, but it does tell you to stop when you get to the number before the questioner has specified to end with, which is 20 in this case.\n4. Therefore, you can start with 2 and add 2 until you get a total of 20. Whenever you try this out, you'll realize that the answer set is actually 3, 5, 7, 11, and of course, 20.\n5. When you're told to \"find the next numbers\", typically this is a sequence of steps that you should iterate to complete the request.\n6. In this instance, however, the answer set is actually just 5 numbers as opposed to, say, if the question asked to \"find the first 5 prime numbers\", your answer set would be prime numbers in ascending order, which would mean that you could just use the code of 2 5 7 11 and 13, then you would answer with the word \"next\".\n7.

Two of the loads require bleach.\n\nWe need to figure out 7*30 + (2*30) to get the total.\n\nNote: Here the context is the first \n\nStep 1. Understand the question. In this case, we are solving 7*30 = 20(Heavy Wash + Regular Wash + Light Wash) + 2*(Total Light Washes) + 2*Extra Light Washes per Load\n\nStep 2. Identify the variables. We need to isolate and solve for the variable. The variable in this case is the total number of gallons used for all seven loads.\n\nNote: We're looking for the total, not the per load\n\nStep 2a. Calculate using the variables we identified. A standard equation for this type of problem is y=30-x because that is how many gallons we take away in the heavy wash.\n\ny = 30 - (7*10) =27\n\nStep 3.

How fast  does Ann walk?\nChoice: A: faster than the President B: faster than Prime Minister C: faster than Prime minister D: slower than President E: slower than Prime Minister\nRationales:\n1) It's best to first read through the first sentence and make sure you don't misunderstand it. \n2) This question is asking how fast does Ann walk. This means you should think about how fast she walks and not what her speed is compared to others.\n\n3) Now lets move onto the other side of the question, Ann walks faster than  the Prime Minister runs.\n4) Using your knowledge from above, if Ann walks faster than Prime Minister runs. That means she walks faster than 61 MPH.  So if Ann walks fast than the Prime Minister run, then she runs faster than 61mph.\n5) Now the only part left is \"Ann walks faster.....\"\n6) We need to take the information from the other side of the statement to determine her speed. Since Ann walks faster than \"the President runs\",  and then she runs faster than \"the Prime Minister runs\". Ann's speed should be greater than the prime ministers run.  That means her speed should be \"61 + 61\" or 122.\n7) Her speed should be slower than \"the President runs\" because she runs slower than \"61 + 122\".\nHer speed should be, \"61 +61 + 17\".  or 123.\n\n8) Therefore, her speed is 123.", "answer": " 15"}

One short side (1/26) has one third the length as the long side (26/3), so the short side should have been 180 feet.\n\n### Rationales: 1) The first sentence of the problem states that a rectangular plot, with three sides being three times longer and one short side rusted from water flowing from a sprinkler.\n2) A sprinkler is a source of water, so to understand the context for the sentence, the statement is, \"The long sides are three times the length the short side will be from water flowing from the sprinkler onto the property.\" \n3) The short side is rusted from water flowed, so there are two possibilities: water is not flowing from the sprnker, or water is flowing, leaving rust as evidence. \n4) The statement can be restated as, \"As the short side of the fencing has turned red from water flowing from from the sprnker onto the plot, I will need to replace one short side of the fences.\"\n5) Now that we have a better understanding of the problem, we know that the rectangle fencing is made up of two sets of numbers: one third of the numbers will be each length of the fencing, and the rest will be the lengths of the short sides.\n6) One third of the fencing (or 2/3's) is the same length as the four short sides of the fencing (it is 1/4 multiplied 3x).\n7) We need to know how many of the 2/3 (or 2/7) are used for the short sides.\n8) 2/7 (fences needed) divided by 1/4(fences made) equals 1/3 of one fence.\n9) One of three equals 1/3 * 3x  = 180 feet of fence will need to be replaced.\n10) The solution, therefore, is that 180 feet will need to be replaced since the 640 foot fence will need to replace the 220/3 (long) feet from one short side.\n### Answer:", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "Total toys: 72.   \n\n### Rationales:\n1. This rationale answers the question. The problem says that Hash has more than half as many as Bill. We begin by assuming that Bill has 60 since he has no other specified amount of toys.\n2. Hash has 9 more toys than Bill. This can be shown as 9 \u2265 Bill.\n3. Bill has 60, so if Hash has 9 more, they equal each other and we can now state that Hash = Bill.\n4. Hash equals to Bill, so Hash has 60 toy, too.\n5. Hash has 60, and Hash has 51% of toys. Therefore Hash has (36) \u00f7 (51 \u00d7 2) = (36 \u00f7 102) more than Bill.\n6. 72 is the total number of toys they have. We add both, Hash and Bill to obtain a total of 72 toys. They are equal because Hash and Bill both have 60.\n\n### A second input:\nInput: Hash has nine less than half as many toy as Bill hash has. If Bill has how many toys?\n\n### Second Response: 60.\nHash and Bill should equal each other since Hash has nine less, according to the question in the second problem.\n\n### The rationales:\n1. By adding both sets of toys, you obtain a new value.\n2. Hash and Bill equal each other, which means the sum of both toys equals 60.\n3. Hash and Bill equal 60, which means that Hash = Bill. From here, you can divide both sides by two to get the value for Hash.\n\n### Input 3\nInput: Mary is four years ___ John. John is two years ___ Mary's brother.

{"text": "You cannot use 5 or more boats in a race\n\n### Demostraration:\nThere are multiple ways to solve this. One could use a system of a equations. Another could use a word problem method. In this case we will use the first method.\n\nThe first part of this sentence shows us that the river is 42 feet wide. \nThe second part of the sentince shows us that there must be a minimum of 2 feet between each boat and any side of the river (and the river bank).\n \nWe can firstly solve for the width of the river. Since we already know that any of the boats must be at least 2 feet away from the river bank, we can write a simple math equation: \n2 + 42 = A\n\nNow, we can write an unknown variable and multiply both sides by 3 to solve for A (within the constraint of the problem). 3A = 3 + 42 and we can subtract off 42 from each side to get an equation we can solve for A. 3A = 1 \nWe can further simplify this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3 and we get: \nA = (1/2) 3\n\nSince we have solved for A, 42 feet, and there are 5 boats, we know that the maximum boats that can race in the river is 41 and not 42. The minimum amount of boats to fill the river are 17 in order to have 2 feet between each of them and the side of the river.\nThis means the answer is 17 \n\n### Input 2: The train is 44 meters long.

{"text": "202 legs.\n\n### Explanation:In order to answer this task, first we have to understand that in the sentence, \"A spider has eight(8) legs\". This means that for each spider there are eight( 8) legs. \nNow, if a group of spiders have 10 more spider than half the number of legs that a single spider has in the group, then the total number of legs in its group is given by formula, `x = y(5 + 5) - 10`. In the example, `y = 8`. \nTherefore, `5 + 5 = 10`, and we are asked to find out the total number of legs, `x` for the group of spiders.\n\nWe can substitute `y` for `8` to find out the total answer.\n``8(5 +5) - 1 \u2248 8 * 10 + 8 - 1 \u2248 = 202`. \n\n### Input : Find the highest price of one of the tickets listed below.Choices:  A: ticket B: price C: ticket D: price E: all of these\n\n### Response : all of these\n\n\n### Exploration : The statement clearly states that you have to find out the highest price of the tickets that is listed below.

{"text": "There's a total of 36 math questions, and Kiana did 18, Shirley did 36 and Fiona did 72 questions. Each of them completed the same number of math questions as before.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. 'They each did the same number..' indicates all three of them each completed the same number as before.\n\n2. Fiona completed 36, then they did the same number, and each was 2/3 as much as Fiona. They did the same number therefore they did 26 questions again.\n3. Shirley did 2/3 as many as Fiona because she did 36 and did the same as Fiona did, and she did 36 beforehand, so this is her new number that she did.\n4. And by the same logic, Kiana done a half of that, so she then did 18, which is 2/3 as Shirleys 26.\n\n5. They did the same amount of questions in the same amount of time which means that they all did the same number of math quests each.\n6. They all completed another 26 in the second hour or they all completed another 18. Either way it comes out to 26 as they all did the same amount of question, so they each still did 26 questions.\n7. This is because after the first hour, they each did the same amount so they repeated that same amount the second hour.\n8.

{"text": "I think the amount owned by James is $65.\n\n### Rationale:\nThere are two equations.\n\nThe first equation is of the form $\\\\$$350 = $j + $a$ and the second equation is of the form $250 = $j - $a$\n\nFrom a first equation of the form $a = $j + b, we get a equation of the form $x = 250$. Therefore, in this equation, $x$ is not an unknown and we cannot use it to substitute from the second equation using the method I learned. What we can do is to write out the second equation into different forms according to the first equation. Let $\\\\$\\\\$a = x + 199\\\\$$\\\\\\\\$b = -x + 40 \\\\$$\\\\$250 = x - 210$\\\\$100 = 40, which is equivalent to $100 = -2a, so x  + b = -2a$\n\n$\\\\$350 = $a + 40\\\\$$\\\\$200 = $a - 40\\\\$\\\\$b = 200\\\\$\\\\$200 = -a, so $\\\\$200 + 2a = -a + 2a = a $\n\nSo $65 = a$. Since $b + a  = 200$ and $a+b = 2a = 200$, which means $a = 40$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\\\$350 - 40 = 250 and James and Ali together own $350 - 250 = 100$.\n\n### Instructions:I am learning math.

This could be explained as being the number nine multiplied by infinity, which equals 999R=9x9=81. In Roman mathematics, the letter R means that you must count until there are 4 of something, and then start back, so for example 100+999=1999R.\nIn 'Star Watch' the ship is called the USS Enterprise.

{"text": "The total of miles Michelle drives on the road trip is 360. The driving is broken down as Tracy drives 372 miles (20 x double Michelle), Michelle drives 1010 miles (3 x driving Katie),and Katie drives 264 miles.\n### Explanation: From the given statement of the problem we know that the sum of the distance Tracy drives is 372 and the sum of Michelle\u2019s distance is 3 x Kati\u2019s distance. It is given that each time her distance doubles her driving distance doubles (2 x Tracy = 372). The same rule applies to Kati where the each time she adds 3 more driving she adds 3 more miles (1010 x 3). Michelle uses the same amount of times to cover her distance, so when you take out those repetitions you get 3 x Kati = 372 + Michelle\u2019s distance. Thus, (1010 X 3) + 264 = 372 x 3 = 20 + 264. Michelle\u2019s original driving distance is 20 x 20, 400 miles. And the distance 3 x 3, 9. We know that to get the total driving distance all 3 drives will add 9 to the total. To get Michelle\u2019s total driving distance take the 9 and divide it by 3, which equals 3.

If \"John is holding\" means that \"John owns\", then he cannot have \"lost so many cards\" from various decks of cards. The sentence can be interpreted as \"John is currently losing so many cards\". This would be wrong because John would need to have previously lost these cards before they were returned.\n3. If \"John is getting\" means that \"John will be getting\", and \"the decks\" refers to the decks, then this can be true because he is arranging them to make sure he is going to have 52 for poker night.\n4. This sentence should be rephrased entirely because of the above points. \n5. If \"John finds\". This means \"that John has discovered\". This could mean that John has found decks that are already full. If this is the case, then he will have no need to arrange the decks as they are already full.\n6. If \"John loses so many cards\" refers to John losing them from the 3 half-full-deck, half of the full-decks and one half of the remaining half-deck.

{"text": "Rationales:\n\n1. To properly answer this question we need to first understand it's form. We can do this by breaking it down into chunks.\n\nWe can easily do this for the first line, \"A cheetah can\"  \"run at a top speed of...\" because they are clauses. To break them down further, they can also be split into sentences.\n\n\"A cheetah can [run at a top speed]\"\n\n\"[run at a top speed] of 60 m.\"\n\n\"m.\"\n\nNext we can divide the second line so it's easier to read. The line consists of \"The gazelle can [run for speeds of up...\"\n\n\"u...t...p...\"\n\n\"o...p...n..a...\"\n\n\"h...\"\n\nEach component consists of parts and can be broken down to make it easier to understand and interpret the question.\n\nNow, as is written in the instruction, this question asks for how much time it takes for a cheetah travelling at that top speed to catch up with a gazelle also travelling at its top speed. We can interpret this to mean that the two animals are on a race and after being instructed to go forwards a set distance at the same speeds, we want to know the cheetah and gazelle finishing line times.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a difficult problem to solve as it's easy to calculate the speeds of the gazelles and cheetahs since we have the maximum speeds of each animal and the distance they need to travel at the same speed. This is done by dividing by time to get their speeds. The formula is:\n\n$$\n Speed = Distance / Time\n$$\n\nLet's look at this example using an imaginary animal to make it easier. This animal has a maximum speed of 200km/h. For this animal, it means it can cover 200km / h = 5 kilometers per hour. It is travelling from a start line at 0.5km and it is 1km away (so +1km) from its finish line.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation $$Speed = (1 - 0.5)/1$$ $$Speed = 0.5$$ But since we are talking about kilometres per hour here and our animal", "answer": " 7"}

The costs of the ride downtwn, taking an Uber or a Lyft or a taxi,  are $3 more than $4 more than $22, which is $45. \n\n### Rationale for A correctness: 1. It is known that Trevor needs to go to downtown for a ransomate date. 2. It is known that the costs of taxi, Uber and Lyft are $4 more than $3 more than $22. 3. It is known that Uber will cost $22. So the question now is: how much does a taxi or a Lyft cost at $22. 4. It is known that a taxi will cost, Trevor will tip 20% of its cost and the cost of the taxi ride is $45. The 20% can be calculated as: $45 x 20% = $9. 5. It is known that cost of Uber or Lyft is not the original cost of the cost but an additional $4. So then the question now is: How much does the total cost of a taxi, Lyft or Uber are, with respect to the answer. 6. It is known that total cost for taxi, Lyft and Uber costs equal $4 more than $45 but $4 more than $12 plus $3. 7. It is known that adding $12 is correct because a cost of Lyft would be $16. That is a total cost for Uber is $35 and Uber costs $22. 8. So then, in short, it is $12 + $3 = $15 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $23 + $3 +$4/3 = $35 +$4 = $43, which equals $45. 9. It is shown that the total cost of taxi, Lyft Uber and cost are cost $45 (since taxi cost $22 and Trevor tips $", "answer": " 18"}

When one removes 10 cats, the total number of cats will be 107 (109-10, since 10 is used for 10 times, 9 is used for 3 times so the number remaining will be 1 times).\n\nSo total dogs number is 109+109=218 and she has 3 times more cats than dogs so the cats number = 3 times -1 which means 107+1=108 so the answer for Heloise is 39-1=38 cats.\n\\\nAnswer - 38, cats\n\n### Input\n*You have a rectangular room.

{"text": "(Your Answer Here)\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The ratio of cats to dogs is 100:100=1:1. Since dogs make up 100*2/100 = 200, or 200% of the total number of animals, there are 100 - 200= -100 - 100= -200 cats.\n2. The ratio of frogs to dogs is 160:100 = 160/100= 3:2. Since frogs make up 3/4 or 75% of the total number, there are 16.4375 - 75 = -58 frogs.\n3. Together, there are: 200-200 = 0 cats.\n4.

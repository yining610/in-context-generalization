(One lion dies and one is born, so either number is subtracted, one month's worth of cubs are born, so one plus that number divided by 5 is added.

{"text": "The formula could be rewritten as \\(x=0.5t+22\\), since \\(t\\) is equal to an integer. Hence, \\(x=-0.38532 t+86.72\\). Therefore, \\(x=0.86655 t-1.02677\\), since \\(t=0\\) is false, \\(t=1\\) will lead to \\(x=-0.86615\\). This means \\(x=3.8656 t-0.1268\\). To find the total earnings, use \\(y=t*x+k\\), with \\(k\\) being the constant. Using this, \\(y=5*3.8654 t+233\\), \\(y=20.2631t-233.342\\)\n\nNotice that each of the variables in the formula is either an integer, or a number that can be converted into an integer with little change. All except the total earnings variable. Since this, it could be converted into an integer using rounding. Hence, \\(y=20000-233.4\\).  \\(\\frac {y-(233.4)}{20000}= 0.010302\\), therefore \\(0.010256*t \\leq y \\leq 0.013286*t\\).

We know that, each day Mack writes for an x minutes. We don\u2019t know what each writing time represents but each have a different minutes value, and each day does a different number of writing. The problem could use hours and minutes instead of days and minutes.\n\nOur code must calculate the total number of pages that Mack writes in his journal. \n\nHere is the maths problem. In the example above the answer would be `52`. \n\nTo find the total number of pages and calculate the sum. \n\nFor the first day, `Mack writes 1 page in his Journal in 30 minutes` therefore we can say `1/30`. For the hours in the day we can say that `30/60` equals `1/2` which means", "answer": " 10"}

How about \"frosty\"?\n\nInput:How many minutes are there in an hour?\n\nAnswer: Minutes are in seconds, so we take the number of seconds in an hour and divide by 60 then round up to the nearest whole second. We convert the 60 minutes in an hour to seconds, then multiply by 60 to give us the hour and then divide, 3600 seconds which equals 36000 seconds. 3600/60= 60 minutes 60/2=30 seconds rounding up to 30 then multiply by six to give us the answer of 3 seconds.\n\nAnswer: 60 seconds in a minute equals 360 seconds in an hour. 60 minute s in an hour equals 360 minutes in an hou r. 360 divided by 60 is 6 times 60 which equals 362 and 362 divided by 60 equals 6.

{"text": "Input: Samuel swept the porch when there were 9/10 of the amount of dust particles on it. The 9x10 = 90. Then as he walked across the porches dust, there were 81 dust particles left. Then (331-81) = 250 so there must have been 250 on the porch before Sam swept it.\n\n### Input and Output:Samuel swept a porch, so I will write the porch in this way. First the porch 900 m 2.6m wide. So the porch contains 36m2 and the width is 2.6m. The depth of the porch is 2.6 times 37, so that is 36 m3. The 900 m2 is (900/36)=25 m2. I found the width and the height of the porch, so I added them up and got 25 units of width and 6 units of height. I found the volume of the porch, I got the width and the height and I multiplied them and I got to the units of volume 25 m2 * 6m2 * 3.7 m2 = 114.5 m2. Next I have to find the amount of dust that is on the porch, the first step is finding the height of the porches. I know the porch is 6 units tall. 6/114 = 0.0535. If I multiply 11 by 0.05 I get 0.55. I have to add that amount to 1 so that's 1.55. I know that the porch has to have a 2.6m walkway, so I need to reduce that sum by 0.0666. Now I need to find out that there must be at least one dust particle in the remaining 0.5234 space. But it's the porches. If there is at least a single particle in the surface, I need to multiply that by 9 because there are 9/10 dust particles on the porch. But multiply 0.05234 with 0.66 and you get 0.003332 which", "answer": " 1080"}

{"text": "Total Time\n+ Time of First Five Runners\n- Time of Last Three Runners\n- 2 Hour's Difference between the Time of the Last Three Runners and the Time of the First Five Runners.\n\n### Discussion:\nThis problem can be explained as follows:\nSuppose the first five runners took 8 hours to finish the race. They took the first 8 hours to complete the race. It means 8 hours was the time consumed by first five runners.\nSecondly, suppose the other three runners finished 2 hours later. So, they took 2 hours to finish the race by spending a total time of 10 hours, because it was consumed by the first five runners and the last runners.\nAgain, suppose that the last three runners and the first five runners finishes the race in 8:15 and 7:52 respectively.\nTherefore, the difference between the time taken by the last three runners to complete the race and the time taken by the first five runnes to complete the race are 15 and 43 respectively.\nHence, we can say that the total time consumed by the first eight runners to complete the eight-kilometer race is 22 hours.\n\n### Input\nIn a race, there were five racers.

{"text": "#### Example 1\nThis question has two parts: $75 + 10 * x = n, $75 + 20% of n = $2x + y.\nWe need to solve for x so the bed frame is $7.5 dollars.  In order to find the total cost, we need to work with the second part of the equation and solve for y.  \nThe bed price is $100 and the 20% is $20 off of $100.  The equation will be: y = $(100 - $20 - $7.5)\nWe divide $7.5 away from both sides and move it to the other side, and then subtract the second 20, we will get: 10x - $2x - $7.5 =y.\nThen we solve for x, 10x = y - ($2x + $7.5).  To simplify, we add $7.5 to each side of the equation since there is no - sign.\nNow we cancel the $7.5, we are left with: 10x =  $ (y + $7.5) or x\n= $75. Add the last $7 to get the total: 75 + 7 = $82.\n#### Example 2\nIn order to answer this question, we need to solve the equation $x = a + b$, but we have no idea what value was used.\nI chose x = 2 and subtracted the 2 from each side. This made the x variable equal to 1.\nThe cost in dollars is: $1 + b = 80 dollars. $1 represents the bed frame, and $80 represents the bed.  There is no $7.5 there, since b is not 7 and it can be b = 20 dollars, which is what you are actually paying after the discount.\nThe total cost is $80 plus $23.75 for the frame, for a total cost of $103.75.\n\n### Input : Calculate this expression: (9! + 12! + 16!)/2\n\n### Response :\n\n#### Example 3\n\nThe expression is: 9!/2 + 12!/2 + 16", "answer": " 660"}

Sally's daily wage requires 218.3 workdays which is equivalentto 218.5/365 =  0.60306, and so on.\n\nThe amount of money saved by both is: `((0.603 + 0.219) * 365) - 100`, where 0.603 is Sally's ratio, and 0.21 is Bob's ratio.\n\nThe total is `R($2,500) = 1,587.9 - 100,000`. That's 80,512 dollars.\n\n### The answer for this problem is $80,511.20", "answer": " 1825"}

This task requires no line of solution.\n\n### Response:(2 + 9) + (102 + 20) + (200 + 6000) + (21 + 200) = 9103 = 12+17+61+66 = (21+ 61) * 2 = 52 = (74 002) * 2 / 5 = 30 9000.

In the first example, 2 was the number 9 carnations. So the first digit in the response should be 2 in the third place, then 9 as the third number of the second digit, and 3572 as the first digit.\n\nFor the second question, there is a pattern in the first 60 001 to 300 000, and no two numbers in the first 59 001 to the 60 0 (this is the last digit 1) have the same difference of 9002.\n\n### Incorrect Solution: The below response is incorrect for the reasoning of not adding all the numbers of carnation between the first, second, and third question:\n\n### This would be equal to: 9 + 14 + 13 = 36", "answer": " 12"}

If both are the same, then all characters are correct.\n* Otherwise, get the solution character from the response, and check to see if the solution's letter is in the response.\n\nIf it's in the response, subtract the letter from the solution and subtract the value from the number (i.e. if A was in the response, the raw score subtracts 6 to it and subtracts it from the number). \n\n* If it isn't in the response, subtract 5 to the solution letter and subtract 5 to the number.\n\nAdd the values up and divide it by the number of all possible letters, which will give the raw score.\n\n### Bonus:\n\nFor bonus, I add another requirement for score calculation:\n\nIn addition to the correctness, the raw score is multiplied by the corresponding score in the dictionary.\nFor example, the characters that are in alphabetical order all receive the same score.  Those that are not all receive a negative score. \nThis is to balance the negative score that gets calculated for \"answer\".", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "I'm not sure about your answer on how to answer the question above. The question seems a bit complicated to me. Let me give some tips for this. I think we should convert these words into a mathematical expression. So, it seems like the 2nd question of the following list, and I am going to explain the steps of solving those expressions.\n\n* The given values are :\n12 years of Li's age: 12\n1 year of Li's age : 1\nT is the age of the Zhang.\nJung is twice as old as Zhang so his age is : 2x\nThe age of Zhang is Z so his age will be:Z\nLet\u2019s use these values in the given expression:\nLi is 12 years of age = 12\nLi is 1 years of age = 2x\nLi is twice as old to the Zhang age so it will be : 2x\nZhang\u2019s age will be Z\nJung is twice older than the Zhang age so Jung\u2019s age will be:2x\n\n2. The variables that have been given in the expression are: Li T Jung.\nThen it is clear now that all the variables are interchangeable at the same level.\nSo let\u2019s convert the 2nd question to the following equation : T = Z + l-1 => T + l-1 = Z+l1\nLi is 14 years of age, so it will be: 14 - 1 = 13 So T+13 = Z+13\n\n3. Substitute Li's value : 12 and Jung's value is 2x. Then it will be : 13 = Z+2x\n\n4. Solve the equation, and write the resulting value : 13 =Z+2x, then Z = 13 -2x,\nZ = 11\n\n5. Li's values are : 8 +1 = 9 in the expression : T=Li +Jung So Z + Jung = Li+Jung\n\n6. From the previous section 3.1, write the substitution for both, T and Li, and then\nthe equation will be : 11=12 +2x, then 12 =11-2x\n\n7.", "answer": " 26"}

{"text": "The book fair posters cost $20, so 20 - 2 = $18. The posters were sold for $5 each, so 18 * 5 = $90. 140 \u2013 90 = $50. The posters cost $5 each, the notebooks cost $4 each, and the bookmarks cost $2 each. 140-18-10-20 = $8. $50 \u2013 $8 = $42.\n\n### Explanation to response:\n\nWe have two $20 bonds, so subtract $2 to get $18 left. That means the posters together will cost us $18. The 2 posters together cost $5, which is $18, then divided by $5. \n\nSo far, it sounds like if we bought 2 posters, we would have $18 in total money. For bookmarks, it would cost $2 and we have $18 in money.\n\nHowever, there are notebooks at $4 each, so we can only buy 2 if we have $18. This adds up to $140.\n\nTo sum up, we have 2 posters costing $5, notebooks costing $4 each, a total of 2 at $18, bookmarks costing $2 each, and a total of 2 again at $18. \n\nSo, if we purchased all those products, we would have $50.", "answer": " 14"}

After the sentence is read, a word is replaced with another, either randomly or on purpose, and each time this happens you hear an alarm go off. You must figure out what word is being replaced with another by listening to the audio file. Each sentence is assigned its own audio file.\nEach word only appears once in the paragraph.\n\n```\nThere are a few other methods commonly used to replace characters in certain situations. One such technique is replacing letters with a symbol. For example, a sentence from a book could have characters replaced\nwith their Greek alphabet symbols.\n\nIn the event a letter cannot be replaced, the sentence could read \u201cThe dog ran to the fire to eat some food.\u201d\n\nIf you are using software to read the paragraph, you could set a variable.

Andrew and Dale both had 2 slices each, if Dale ordered 2 and Andrew ordered 1 they would have paid \u00a312 each which means that the cost of Andrews breakfast would have been \u00a33 more than Dale's cost of breakfast. If you order and pay for 1 slice of bread and 2 eggs it is \u00a35.00 and if you order 2 slices of bread and 3 eggs it is \u00a36.00 for each which means that Dale's cost would be \u00a312.00, making it cost only a pound more than Andrew's cost. We know this because Andrew had less food than Dale and Dale had to pay more for his breakfast because he had to have two slices of bread which is \u00a32.00, if they had ordered the same amount of toast he would only have had to pay \u00a35.00, so he paid and extra \u00a37.00 for his breakfast.\n\n*Based on the rules of order: Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication.\n\n#### Instruction and Demonstration:Input: Dale and Andrew had breakfast together. Andrew had 15 eggs. A slice of toasts costs 10p. Dale had 15 sliced of toast. How many eggs did each order and how much did they pay altogether?\n\nIn order to solve this question, first you need to subtract 15 eggs from 15 slices of toast because Andrew had no eggs in his breakfast and subtract the price of 15 eggs from the price of 12 slices of toasts because he had 3 eggs so he paid less because he only had two slices of toast. Then, I need to multiply 12 eggs by their price of \u00a35.00 each because Dale had more eggs than Andrew he had 10 and he paid \u00a36.00 as we can see in the question he had 15 toasts and Andrew had 15 toast. So the price he paid was 10x6=\u00a360 because each egg cost \u00a35", "answer": " 15"}

The key to defining a strategy is to identify the _gap_ between where you currently are, and where you want to be. A choice of course of action that bridging this gap. Therefore, when thinking about the strategy, think of the gap.\n\nIn the case of the problem in the scenario, the gap is the difference in points between student 1 and student 2. The student is using the book to study for her exams; hence the points. This suggests that the student has found her strategy and the gap is to be filled by the book. Hence the strategy in this case is to increase her points from 25, to 27, or increase her score by 2 points.\n\nIn the problem stated, the teacher was given the same choices of numbers to give. This is what happens in examinations where the choices of answers is always the same.\n\nThe teacher's strategy therefore involves using a questionnaire to gather responses on a number of areas. This strategy allows the teacher to obtain the information they need to make an estimate or a decision. The strategy involves gathering responses, so the questionnaire is important; and the strategy can be stated as: Questionnaire design to gather needed information.\n\nThe main thing to understand here is that without the design of the questionnaire, you cannot form or have a strategy.\n\nThe teacher has not designed any questionnaire to gather the needed information.

{"text": "### Input 2\nA: 5,160\n\n### Instructions:\nDescribe in detail how you would answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Since the zoo has 8 parrotss, the zoo must also have 2s of snakes. Thus, the zoo has 10 snakes. The zoo must also have 3 times more parrots than snakes, which is 2 (since 2s times 3 is 6). In that case, the zoo has 3 snakes and 16 parrots. Next, the zoo has 2 times more monkeys than snakes, which means that the zoo has 2 monkeys for each snake. Since the zoo has 16 parrothas, then, the zoo must have 8 parrots and 16 monkeys. To determine the number of elephants in the zoo, we solve:\n\n- The number of elephantshas 1/2 more elephantshan the zoo has parrots and snakestogether.\n- This is half the number of zoo animals that have parrotshere.\n- Thus, the number of elephantswho lives in the zoo is 4.\n\nFinally, we have to determine the number of zebras less than the number of elephanthere. \n\n- 6 times the number of zoo animals less then elephanthere, \n- This is 3 times the number who zoo animals other than parrots and snackshas\n- 3 times the number is 18 zoo animals who were not parrots and snacks.\n- Since there are 3 zoo animals who were not a monkey, those who were not zebrushas to add up to 15.\n\nThus, the number of zoo animals who were not zebras, which is 12.

{"text": "Let X represent the price of the bags, and let Y represent the number of bags the teacher purchases.  The equation that describes the problem is,\n\nX + 14 * 3X = 11 * 1X + Y\n\nSo, we can simplify the expression.\n\n42X = 25\n\nNext, the teacher needs to distribute the 42X equally among her 25 students.  To do so, we need to divide 42X by Y.  The equation that can be used to solve this is,\n\n42XDivideByY = (Y - X) + Y\n\nSo dividing 42 by 25, we solve the equation to find 10.  Plugging the correct value of Y in for 25, we find Y = 47, or Y = 23.\n\nNext, we can plug the value of Y into the original equation.\n\nSince,\n\nX = 42(25/47) = 20.16\n\nThe least amount of money the student can spend on the baggage for 25 students is $20.16.

When one unicorn has walked 3 steps forward, the six unicorns walk for 18 meter, so 6 unicorn walks for 3 meter per step and the 9 kilometers can be represented as 18 * 6. In order to calculate the final number, we need to 23 meters because a unicorn can be represented as 3 step forward. At the end of this journey, we can reach the final number of 2364 by multiplication.\n\nWe can see the six unicorn move 6 meter forward in 1 step, so the six unicorn has moved 6 meter forward in the 15 step of walking for 5 kilometers.", "answer": " 72000"}

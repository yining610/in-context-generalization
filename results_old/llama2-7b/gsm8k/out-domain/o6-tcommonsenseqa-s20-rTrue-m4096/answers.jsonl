How much did she get, $3.00 or $4.50; it wouldn't make much difference.\n\nAnswer: $4.50.\n\nDemonstrations: Here, the question refers to babysitting, which is time spent caring for children as a job or role. \n\nDemonstration: The question involves a scenario, which is when someone says that YESTERDAY she just did 5:00 minutes \"of babysitting\", and then asks about her earnings for the day.\n\nDemonsteration 1: So, as mentioned before, in a babysitting scenario, a day refers to a 24-hour period from sunrise to sunset. \n\nDemosnteration 2: So in a 24-hr day $50 = (24/12)*12*12 is the amount. As the babysitter did 1/5 of that, the earning per hour is (50/50)*12*13. The 13 is for the additional half an hour. Therefore, the earning is $4.64. Which means that the babysitter got $4.64 for her babysitting on that day.\n\nDemosntration 3: Here, because we are using 50 minutes as a base, the earnings are also in fraction, which equals to $0.15 per minute.\n\nDemosntation 4: This means that the answer requires using the fraction, in this case, half an hours worth of babysitting times $4.64 to figure out the amount that babysitter was paid.\n\nTo get the final answer, we multiply 50/2 by $4.64,\n\nThe answer =($4.64/2)*(50/2) = $4.50\n\nAs this is quite a lot to answer in just one question, we have provided the instructions and solution under two different sections.\n\n### Input and Instruction:\n\nHow much is 30 minutes worth of", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "There are 300 flowers in the garden.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. If the ratios of 10:80 and 80:25 hold true, then we can substitute one of those ratios into the statement to eliminate the other unknown quantity:\nLet 10:8 = 8:2\n2. That means we can eliminate the variable representing yellow flowers, (y) from the equation:\n(y + 10)*10 = 80*2 [substituting in first ratio]\n3x + 90 = 160 [adding 10 to both sides]\n4. The yellow flowers make up 50% of the garden, meaning that 5x = 50\n5. This means that there are x = 100 yellow flowers in the garden, which, using our initial proportions leaves us 1x + 8 = 65, we can multiply by 2, this leaves us 2x + 17 which, when substituted into the original equations, gives us :\n3x + 33 = 160 - 3x - 100 + 10 = 161\nThere are 3x + 11 yellow flowers we can't account for - 17 = 21.\n6. 300 - (21 + 11) = 268\n7. That leaves 2 - 68 = 66 purple flowers unaccounted for.\n8. 600 - (268 + 66) = 266\n\n9. There are 25% more yellow flowers than green, meaning 2y = 3z\n10. which leaves y - (z/3) = 3z/5\n11. This gives us 2x - 9 = 5z - 100\n\n12. So x = 50\n13. However, we know that in the original wording 50% were yellow flowers, meaning 50 = (y + x) - 2\n\n14. Adding these two equations together:\n50 = ([y - (z/3)] - y) + y\n15. 50 = (z/", "answer": " 35"}

The following steps will help you solve the problem at hand.\n\n**1.** Let's start by determining all the options Kimber provides 10 cups water, 16 cup flour, and \u00bd cups salt, thus, let's write the amount of water first:\n\n`10*cups = 10 * 0.094635038 l`\n\nIn one cup of water, there are 9.463504 gr of water. We know \"10 cups\" are included in the initial data.\n\n**2. The next step is to define all the units in Kimber's calculations. According to [APH Glossary of Terms](https://aphonline.org/glossary/), cups are a \"basic measuring unit of volume.\"\n**TIP: Make sure to write your calculations in the same units used in the problem**\n\nAccording to the rules of the equation, the number of teaspoons (in this case the salt quantity is \u00bd cups), has to be written in the following proportions:\n\n   `(5, 10, 15,...)` in which `5` indicates the quantity in units of quantity you consider in the initial equation\n\n**3. After analyzing and understanding the problem clearly, we can start calculating the total amount of water, flour and salt by using the steps below:\n**a.** Let's begin by calculating water, 10 cups is equal to `10 * 09463.504 l = 946.354 l`\n**b.** Second, we can start to calculate the 16 cups.

This means the second equation is 20 x 25 = 20 x 5: 20 x 10 marbles.\n\nBecause the marbles Baez initially had was 25, and the loss was 5 marbles and double the amount of marbles she had after the loss which is 10 marbles, she still has 15 marbles.\n\nThe equation 25 = 10 is correct because for 25 marbles minus 5 marbles equals 10 left.\n\nHence, (25) - (5) = 10, hence, option A is the correct answer.", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "Six cones costing $100 total = $16 is $100. So that's 56 cones total sold divided by 6 for $100 in total gives you the correct answer of 16.\n\n### Rationales:\nFirst, it's important for us to understand the context of the question. A \"customer\" is a person who makes a purchase in a store, restaurant, or other business. In this case, the business is an ice cream shop, so \"customer\" refers to someone who buys something at the shop.\n\nNext, we should analyze the options carefully. The question tells us that for every sixth customer, they will get a free ice cream. This means that if there are six customers who buy ice cream, one of them will get a free cone.\nHere's what we need to figure out: If Dan, the shop owner, sold $100 WERT = the amount of money he made from the sales of ice cream cones, how many customers had a free cone? It's important to note that in this case, this is referring to six people who got a free cone, as the question tells us that the reward is given to every sixth customer.\n\nTo tackle this question, we will use the following mathematical formula: \n\nLet P = the probability of getting a free ice cream\nLet C = the cost, which is $2 in this case\n\nSo, we can use the formula C = P * (1 - P). This means that the cost of an ice cream cone is the probability of getting a reward multiplied by the cost of an ice-cream cone.\n\nLet's take a look at all the options in the formula.\n\nOur first option, A, is incorrect because a 56% probability of winning does not equal 0.2 * 0.2. Our second option, B, is incorrect because 0.08 * 4 = 0.32 is not greater than 0.01. C is the correct answer because 0.56 * 0.2 = 0.112 is less than 0.56.

{"text": "5 gallons of water: 20+10+10+2+2+2+1+2=50+6=56 gallons\n\nRationales:\n1. The first step to answering this question involves understanding the types of loads to be washed and the number of gallons of water used for each. This information is presented in a table format making it easy to comprehend.\n2. The table lists two heavy washes, 3 regular washes and 1 light wash.\n3. This suggests that there would be two loads to be washed that are heavy, and 3 loads to be washed regular loads, 1 is light.\n4. As for the additional information asking \"if bleach is used,  there is an extra light cycle wash added to rinse the clothing thoroughly\", this is helpful in understanding that 2 gallons of additional water is used for bleach. This leaves us with 2 light washes used, which were added to 5 per load of laundries.\n5. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the number of loads and the number of gallon gallons per round.\n6. For this reason, the formula: ((Loads * Gallons) + (Gallons used for bleaching))  = Total Gallons of needed water.\n7. From this, the result is 5 gallons of water. \n8. This is obtained by multiplying the 20 pounds of weighted loads, 10 gallon standard load and 2 gallon lights cycles.\n9. 20 x 10 = 200.\n10. 200 + (2 x 2)  = 204 gallons.\n11.

Show your work in the space provided for this assessment.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n- To understand the properties of real numbers, it is necessary to understand what they are. \n- Real numbers are all of the numbers that can be used to measure something real, such as length, height, and weight. Real numbers can be both positive and negative, rational and irrational, and infinite or finite. \n- Algebraic thinking is the ability to think mathematically and work with math equations. It involves understanding the symbols and how to manipulate them to solve problems. This includes recognizing patterns, interpreting equations, and constructing and following symbol manipulations. Algebraic thinking is often used when dealing with abstract concepts, such as those found in geometry or calculus.\n- The algebraic thinking process begins by asking a question or identifying a problem. Next, the potential formulas needed to solve the problem are identified, and the variables are assigned appropriate values. The various components are then combined to evaluate the problem and arrive at a solution. This can involve setting up an equation or system of equations, plugging in values, and solving for the variable(s) of interest. \n\n### When identifying an algebraic equation, one should first identify the variables in the problem and then determine how many of each variable is involved. \n\n## How to solve:\n\n### The first step is to identify the problem. In this case, the problem asks about a plot of fenced land with dimensions given in feet. \n\n## Calculation Method:\n```\n\nThe length on the short side is given as 3 x the length on the long side, so we set the equation `longside_length x 3 = shortside_length`. Rearranging this into standard form, we have `shortside_length = longside_length / 3`. We can plug in the known dimensions to find the answer of 110.5.\n\n``` \n\n### The algebraic expression is `shortside_length / longside_length = 3`.

{"text": "Answers the following: You can buy 4 appels or 1 watermmelon for the same price, you bought 36 appels evenly split between orangers, appels, and watermmelons, and the price if 1 orangers is 50$.\n### Demonsturation:\nRationales:1. When comparing different fruits, always include the total bill if possible. If you look at how many of each fruit you bought, you can tell that you bought fewer appels and more watermmelons.\n2. If the price of 1 orangers is $0.5 and the total bill is $66, then the price of 1 watermmelons must  be $55/$66=1.00/2.00=0.50.\n3. 4 appels are $40 or $10/4= 50.00. So $10.00/50.00=1.00 so 1 appels is $1.00.\n4. Total bill=number of fruits*price of fruits.$66.00=36.00*price of watermmelon+$36.00=480.00.\n\nInput:A man saw an incredible number of what?

It is not possible to spend money in the US, so they are not relevant.\n3.Mexico is the only location in the sentence where it is possible to spend money.\n4.Next, we must identify the total amount of money that was spent in Mexico.\n5.To do this, we must understand how the question was worded.The phrases \"both the United States and Mexico\" and \"in 2012\" are essential clues to the problem at hand.\n6.Therefore, looking again at the sentence, we realize that the information about the total amount of money in Mexico is located between parentheses.\n7.Therefore, the total amount of money Mexico spent in 2013 was $1722.4 million.\n8.This amount alone cannot answer the question for two reasons.\n9.First, we do not know the total amount that was spent in the United States in 2014.\n10.Second, we were able to subtract the number in Mexico from the number in the United States, we can't add them because the question was asked to find John's final amount or need.\n11.Therefore, to answer the initial question, we must combine the total amount of money spend in the United States with the total amount of money John earns to find his final balance.\n12.In other words, we must find John's missing amount of $60.\n13.Fortunately, we are given two pieces of information about the money spent by John:\n14.The total amount of money spent by John in the previous weekend was $20.\n15.Since the amount of $20 is given, we can now calculate the total amount John must earn to equal $60(missing amount of money).\n16", "answer": " 13"}

Choices: A: out A: left B: got C: left  D: married E: lost her job.\nRationales: We first need to analyze the word choice and sentence structure. \"She fell in love\" is a compound predicate made from two parts (\"fall\" and \"in\"). This is a commonly used phrase and is also written with preposition \"with\" instead of \"in\". Also, although it was the context of the story that Anna Karenina fell in love, she has already fallen in love so we must be very specific in determining what specific circumstance of falling in love has occurred in the storyline. \n\nStep two: Review the given choices and apply the rules of the specificity in the grammar. All of the given options would apply to any situation a person might fall in love with (A, B, D, and E) and the other two choices (C and B) both express specific actions that indicate failure in love, so we must choose the one that makes most logical sense in this context.

First, notice that we are only given the numbers of the addends and not their actual values. This means that we would need to first convert these numbers into their actual values.\n2. Second, there are different ways to add numbers such as adding them together one at a time or using the sum symbol (  + ).  The example given below illustrates adding two numbers - one by one and the other by using the sum symbol:\n```\nAdding one by one: 2+2=4\nAdding by using the sum symbol:(2+2) = 4\n```\n3. Finally, for this addition, a carry may occur, where the sum of the numbers exceeds the value of the digit being used.   When this happens, we write down the sum of any numbers that were not added, and carry the sum of those numbers forward (known as a \"carry\") to the next digit.

How many of each thing does she have?\n\n### Demostration:Input:\n\n### Sarah has two pairs of which? A: socks B: shoes C: shoes D: flip flops\nRationales: A. There are two groups of the noun socks. Sarah has 2 of each group (2 pairs ). It is important to look for items that can be counted and be quantified. In the question above, socks can be counted and is the item that can be quantified.\n\n### Sarah also has six pairs of\nA: flip flops B: sock C: shoes Ds: flip flop\nRationales:\n\n### David also has two pairs of\nA: shoes B: socks C: flip flop D: shoes\nRationales: Again, it is important to look for counting and quantifiable items. Although flip flops can be counted and be counted as 2 pairs in this question, the sentence does not state that Sarah and David have 2 pairs of socks or shoes.\n\n### To determine the total number of Sarah and David, we just add the pairs.

{"text": "The answer is option E: 8 (18 * 3/3 + 3 * 3/3) = 8\n\n### Justification: 3 tea leaf plants have 18 green leaves. 1/3 of them turn yellow and then fall off. If 1/3 of 18 = 6, then there must be 2 green leaves left.  If 2 * 3 = 6, then 6 - 6 = 0, meaning all 10 turn yellow and fall off.  So, of the 30 leaves, 8 are the final count of green leaves.

Choices: 1: x = the number of pairs of shoes that are manufactured 2: x = the amount of time it takes to manufacture shoes 3: x = the cost of materials used to manufacture shoes. 4: x = the number used to define the price of the shoes 5: x = the price of the shoos \nRationales: In the question, it describes that the cost to manufacture pair shoes at $15 per pair so it's 15 times x to the shoes. It also describes that if x is a certain number then the price to manufacture will be $15 * x = $225. We have to understand what is x, to find the price to manufacture $225. If we think about the options, shoes are made to be in pairs so option 2 is not correct because you start x at 1 pair of shoes but doesn't say anything about the rest of the pairs that are made in the shoes. Option 3 is the only one that can talk about the other pairs that will be used at the end and because that option is the only one that only talk about 'everything that is made' that is why it can be a good option. We can say that 'x = the cost of materials and time used to manufacture shoos'. Based in this we know that x must have the pair of shoes as the quantity of x'shoes' because the question is talking about everything that is made in the pair of shoes 'x' like materials and time. We also know that if x pairs of shoes are made then we multiply it by the cost of materials & the time for us to get the total cost but it depends of the total cost of those pair of shoes. That is why we are multiplying by $15, because it is the price of the shopping you are buying and it will cost x that times, so option 5 will be our final price. Option 4 will be incorrect because the options always uses 'number' when it speaks of a specific number, so it will always be correct when it is written 'the number used' however, that option talks about all the", "answer": " 42"}

First, we'll have to figure out which terms are referring to a specific and distinct property, e.g. high or medium, and which are describing a range or degree, e.g. larger or smaller. \n2. In this case, the terms 'high','medium' and 'low' are used to refer to a specific property.\n3. So, 'high' and'medium' represent two different attributes or options to choose from, while 'low' is not part of the choice and is used to denote a particular level of resolution or image quality.\n4. Moreover, it can be inferred from the question that the computer system needs to display something at a higher resolution.\n5. This hints that there is a lower level of resolution, and thus 'lower resolution' describes the starting point.\n6.

Choices: \nA: 2408 B: 1200 C: 5 D: 400\nRationales:\n1. The word \"are there\" is redundant, there are \"400\" students more than in 2008.\" How many students are there\" can be correctly changed to \"How many students are in 2016 if 400 more are there than in 2014?

The word \"are\" in \"How many students are there if 400 in 2017\" and \"How many students is there if 40\" make it clearer that students are being counted.\n3. There were as many students in 2004 as in 2015 and not 2014.\n4. The number of students is now 6000 and they have been increasing since 2004.\n5.

She also has an income of $80 per moth.\n3. She pays $12 for taxes per month which is 4/5ths of $12 per month which is 12 divided by 15.\n4. She has $18 left over at the end of this month and her tax expense is 4/5 of $12 per moth which means her tax expense is $11.6\n5. $11.6 + $42 is $53.6, so that is how much she is given per month to pay for her necessities.\n6. At the end of the month, she used all of her $18 and has $11.6 left over.\n7. She contributed $53.6 for necessities, and saved 4.6 (divide 18 by 42 and round to the nearest hundred) to get $18.\n8. So her final savings are $18 + $11.6 = $39.6\n9. 39.6 dollars divided by 80 dollars is 0.6 which means she contributes 60% to that family's household expenses.\n10. She has $42 left over per month = 60% of $42.\n11. The tax expense is 60% of her salary, and her total contribution to necessities is 60% multiplied by 53.6, which is $32.\n12.

{"text": "49\n### Detailed Response:\n1. First, we understand that'seagulls' refers to animals and 'kids' refers to children.\n2. We also note that the problem statement only mentions specific numbers of animals.\n3. The first sentence indicates that there are 36 seabirds on the roof. \n4. And, the second sentence tells us that 'kids scare 1'/'4' of them away by throwing rocks; the fraction represents a percentage.\n5. It also tells us that 13 remaining seabirds stay on the roof. This means that a third of those 13 have decided to leave and go to a new place. \n6. So, among the birds remaining, we lose 1/3 of them, meaning 2/3 = 7/3 are left. \n7. Therefore, 2 out of 3 birds that have decided to leave the roof have decided to go to the McDonald's lot. \n8.

To answer the question multiply each trash can by 2. Since each trash can is 1 on each side, you will get 2 on one side and 2 on the other side. Thus the answer is 21.\n\n### Output: There are a number of answers you can get, one of them is to explain the problem like this:\nYou can consider again each trash can costs as 1. \n\nOn one side, they are increasing the amount by the amount they are adding to the back of store. Since each trash costs as 1, they can divide each side by the cost per trash can which is 1.\n\n\nThus the answer is:  \n- Street - (14/1) = 14 trash\n- Store - (21/1) = 21 trash\n\n\n### Output 2\n\nTo explain each side of the street you can divide it by 1.

Among the options, \"companionate\" stands out as the most distinctive and significant.\n### Step 2: Next, let us examine all other qualities given to determine their relevance and significance.\n### Step3: A: reliable. This option is slightly less relevant because \"reliable\" does not refer to a friendship or camaraderie but rather to \"trustworthiness\" or \"dependability\" in a broader sense.\n### Step4: B: respectful.

They just have 2 books. How many books do they not have?\n\n### Correct Response:Some students need to study a new topic, but currently lack 9 books. They need a total of 11 books. Given that they only have 2 books, there is a total of 9 books that they need in order to complete the study of the new topic.\n\n### Rationales:To write a complete sentence, a student needs to identify the subject and verb of the sentence, and the object, which the verb acts on.\n\n\n### To answer the task, one should ensure that the subject (noun acting as the main character of the sentence) and the verb (noun (active) form of the verb acting as an action) are present in a sentence.\n\n\nThe student's incorrectly chosen answer had the incorrect noun in response to the question \"How many books do they not need?\".

{"text": "5/6 of 30 is equal to 5. Thus, 5nuts are left.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe fraction 5/6 translates to ten of the sixes. We're given that 10 of the sixes have already been counted because they have been eaten. Therefore, there are 20 of the remaining sixes. The left over sixes is calculated by subtracting 10 from 20, leaving 10. Therefore, 5/6 of 20 equals 5/6 * 20 = 10/6 = 8/6 = 5/6.\n\nThe next question is, if 5/6 is 5/6 of a group of 30, then what fraction is the remaining fraction? We do not have the answer to this question, so we will need to make a little more work.\n\nWe can solve this by multiplying 5 over 6 by both sides. On the left side we have 5/6, then we multiply that by 6 in order to get the following.\n\n5/6 * 6 = 20/30\n\nOr, one third 5/6 = 20 over 30, which turns to an improper fraction, 201/30\n\nBut what we're given is that 5/6 of these nuts were previously eaten, and 1/6 is 5 over 6.\n\nThat's the same as doing 5/6 from the left side to get 5/6 *5/6 which equals 5/6.

After she bought the extra marbles and frisbies, she currently has 2X5, 10 X (20 + 24 = 44) = 290. We know by subtraction this results in the total number of marbles and frisbyes being 90.\n5. Next, we want to add the total number of marble packs she currently has to the total number of frisbyes. 90 + 20 = 110.\n6. Then we subtract the sum Bella had at the beginning (60 + 100 = 160) from her current marble count (110) to get the total number of marbling packs she currently has (50).\n7.

{"text": "The total amount of kibble given to Luna was 2 cups, since there was a total of 12 cups. \nSo, 12 cups minus 2 cups equals 10 cups of kibbles.  Then, 1 cups of kibbies given in the morning equates to 2 cups subtracted from the 10 cups total, then the final answer is 8 cups of kibbie left.\n\n### Rationales:The above response is not correct because it starts solving the problem in step 5.  The first step is to understand the problem itself.\n\nThe above response reads that Mary gave Luna 2 cups, but that is a complete lie.  Since there are 12 cups of kids in the bag, Mary did NOT feed Luna 2 cuples.  Instead, the statement above implies that the bag is not going to be emptied, which is wrong.\n\nThe above answer also shows a misunderstanding of the word \"remaining\".  The word \"remaining\" only applies to the remaining amount of something that has already been used or taken.  Since Luna has eaten most of her kibbles, there is no way for her to be eating \"remaining kibbles\".\n\nThe answer reads that there is 10 cuples of kibble left, which means there were 10 cuples to start and not 12.  The given problem itself states that there are 12, so this answer is incorrect.\n\nNext, the answer reads that there is only 6 of the total 10 cuples left.  This again, is incorrect.  Instead, since Luna was eating a total of two cuples and Frank was eating five cuples, there are a remaining 5 cuples left. \n\nThe next step to solve the problem is to figure out the total amount of kibbles given to Luna.  Using the equation A = 12 - B, where A is the total amount of kids left and B is the amount that Luna received for the day, we can equate:\n<Math> B = 2 - A <Math>\n\nNext, solve for A:\n<Math> ( 12 - B ) = 2 <Math>\n<Math> A =", "answer": " 7"}

There are no numbers next to the names of both dogs and cats, so we can start by writing down what we know so far.\n\n**Options available:**\n```plaintext\nThe number of pets in total is 189\nThe number of dogs is 10 more than number of cats\nOne hundred cats\nSixteen cats (16)\nTwenty cats (20)\nTwenty one cats (21)\nTwenty two cats (22)\nTwenty three cats (23)\nTen dogs\nSeventeen cats (17)\nTwenty four cats (24)\nTwenty five cats (25)\nThe number of dogs after 25 cats is 7\n26 cats (26)\nTwenty seven cats (27)\nSeventeen dogs\nTwenty eight cats (28)\nThree cats left, total twenty nine, after that seven dogs are left\nTwenty nine cats (29)\nThree cats plus seven dogs left, total thirty two cats\nTwenty nine cents (29)\nTwenty nine cucumbers (29)\nThe number of cats is twenty nine, one hundred and twelve dogs are left, Helen has thirty two cats\n```\n\nNow let's go through the calculations in order:\n1. We know there are a total of 26 cats after Helen leaves 7 dogs to Janet.\nThis is because we know there are 10 more dogs than cats, so 10 extra cats are remaining to be given from 10 more than the original cats.\n2. Then we calculate that the remaining 29 cats are equal to the total of Helen's dogs and cats which is 62 total animals.\n3. This makes the total remaining dogs left with Helen as 33 (29-7, 63+33=96. 96 divided by 1", "answer": " 60"}

For a correct response, we need to determine the total number of frogs. We can do this by multiplying the number of frogs (160), by 2 (2 x 160 = 320).\n2. To find the total number of cats, we can subtract frog amount from the dog amount (100 + 320 - 160 = ~50).\n3. To find the total dog population, we have to remove 100 (first frogs) + 320 (second frogs) from original dog population (~420 - (100 + (320 x 2))).\n4. Since the total number of 20% is less than 160, then the total of animals will be 160 x 0.8 (= 128).\n5. Therefore, the total number of animals in a compound is 128 + 250 = 420.", "answer": " 304"}

{"text": "Input: Answer: 7 minutes\n\n### Reasoning:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the units we are working with. The first option we need to consider is the rate of climbing for both Jason and Matt, which is represented by F.\n1. The first option F= 6 gives a total of 60 feet(6*10).\n2. If the rate is a measure of speed, units must be considered: both Matt and Jason are climbing a telephone poll (a pole) but Matt is doing so alongside a tree. So, the actual unit of measurement is more likely to be a person, not feet.\n3. If we convert 6 feet to meters, it is equal to 1.8 meters.\n4. Therefore, the unit for the first option, F=6 should be m/min instead of feet/min.\n5. By making this conversion, the original problem should still hold. However, if we do this, we are essentially scaling the problem up because now the telephone poll is equivalent to 16.8 meters, and 12. However, we can still apply the formula for finding the time with the rate given.\n6. Next, F=12 tells us that Matt can climb 16.8 ft/minute and that Jason can climb 24 ft/minute.\n7. Now when we insert these values into the original equation of xminutes=6ft/min*(F+F)/2.\n8. We get x1minutes=165/(12(11)) and so our answer is 165/130 ft(16.8/12)\n9.

(40 people were drinking soda, and 10 people were not drinking either soda or sparkling.)\nThe question asks: how many recyclables were returned in total?\nSince we know for 10 people, none were returned (since they had no cans or bottles) and for the other 40 people, half were returned (since half the people drank sodas and half didn't).\nWe can substitute the number of cans returned with the number of people drinking soda, by dividing the cans by the \"40:1\".

Comparing 9 with each of them, we can conclude that 9 is larger than 4, 6, and greater than 8.\n\n### So now we can confirm that 9 is the greatest of all the integers.\n\n### Thus, in this problem, 9 is the largest number.\nAnswer: 9\n\n### Inputs: What is the greatest number?\n\nRationale: It's important because when numbers are very large, it is often best to simplify them, making it easy to compare the sizes. One way to do this is to convert the number into a fraction, with each place representing a group.\n\n## Output: 88", "answer": " 13"}

Choices:  a: a lot b: a little c: few d: a bunch e: about the same\nRationales: The question is asking us for the difference in magnitude between two things, the mass of the moon, and the mass of a common human.\n1. The first thing we need to understand is what magnitude is a measure of.\n2. Magnitude is a unit of measurement for something of a certain size. Here, the magnitude of the moon (for example) is measured as its weight (mass).\n3. The question provides us with 0.635 as the answer. But what does this mean?\n4. To understand what we've been given in the question, we first identify the 0.63 as the magnitude being represented, or the moon's mass. This magnitude, 0.63, when added to the magnitude of a normal human (weight) is 0.645. \n5. This means that, when we combine the human's total weight and the moon's total weight, we get a total weight of 0.6415, which is a difference of only.015 in magnitude. But, more importantly, we get a difference in magnitude of a whole lot fewer things.\n6. We find, therefore, \n7.

{"text": "To complete this task, it is necessary to understand the context in the sentence. That means we need to know what terms mean and understand their structure.\nThe term \"cash sales\" refers to situations when people pay for purchases in cash, typically through the use of legal tender or coins. \n\nThe term \"credit sales\" implies that people have purchased items by using a credit card, as opposed to cash or coin. That means that purchases made using credit cards are now considered a debt that will need to be repaid.\n\n### To solve this problem\nLet's find the exact phrase \"2/5 of the sales\" from the sentence. We can see that it is used with two numbers, so the relationship between the numbers indicates that 2/5 is \"proportion\" and 80 is the \"amount\".\n\n### The term \"proportion\" means \"a kind of relative number, meaning that one thing is expressed in terms of another.\"\n\n### \"Amount\" means \"a set amount of something, usually for the purpose of buying or selling. \"\n\n\nNow, let's work on the two equations.\n\n$$ \\frac 2 5 * 80 = (Cash + Credit) * 2/5$$\n\nThis means that: $2 * 80/5 = (Cash +Credit) $\n\n$$ 160 = (Cash+Credit)$$\n\nSo, if we do a division, this will become:\n\n$$ 1:1 = Cash + Credit$$\n\nFrom the above example, we can conclude that we have one amount of $160, and this amount is the total amount he sold.\n\nAnd now what we need to do from that point on is to work on the second part.\n\nThe second part is to work with the question:\n\n$$If 2/5 of sales were credit sales, and all credit sales cost $80, how much did credit sales cost?$$\n\nBy knowing the above solution to the part 1, we can eliminate 2/5 as a part of this question.\n\nTherefore, we should substitute 2/5 with the result above, namely 1/5, and change all of them to \"cash\" (all will be 160/5", "answer": " 48"}

The task requires finding a specific number: the number of cards Rick gave to his sisters.\n\nLet's walk through the steps to finding this number. To begin, we need to understand the question being asked and separate it into its constituent parts. This means breaking up the information into manageable chunks, starting with \"Rick has 190 cards. He decided \u2026\".\n\nA good strategy for working through challenging questions in math is to focus on one bit of information at a time, and think about the meaning of the bit of information and its possible relation to the other pieces of information that we know. So, in this case, let's start with the number 130. This is a part of the information asked about, which we know is the number of cards Rick has.\n\nNext, let's look at what Rick does with these cards. For the task, we can read  \"He decided to only keep 51 cards and so he gave some of the cards to Miguel.\"\n\nIn the beginning, we knew three things about the cards: Rick had 130; there were some cards he didn't want to keep but didn't know which ones. The question gives us the answer \"15\". (So, the cards Rick kept were the 15 that he had picked out.) We can now see that Rick gave some of his cards to Miguel. After Rick decided to keep 51, he took the 51 he didn't want, and gave them 12, to each of the eight people, which leaves 37. So, we now know that 8 * 12 = 4 pieces can be given to each friend. So, if each person does 4, that leaves one person.\n\nNext, we find out the remaining cards were given to Rick's sisters, and we know the number of cards Rick's sisters receive: 3 each.\n\nSo, now we know the cards Rick kept: 51, the 40 he gave to his siblings and the total remaining, 3 cards.\n\nCombining this information, we have:\n```", "answer": " 13"}

First, understand the nature of the problem.\n2. Start by eliminating options that don't appear to be algebra problems.\n3. One option, 'A: 5x=25,' is clearly an equation, but it includes letters rather than numbers, which is less typical in algebra problems.\n4. Another option, 'B: 3x=16,' is an equation with the letter 'x,' but it includes two separate values that equal the same number, creating a scenario that doesn't make sense.\n5.

Let's begin by eliminating any options that are not likely places where the dog could stand, for example 'tall' and 'long'. \n2. Among the other choices '1 1/4' can be taken to be a fraction, because 4 is 1/2, and 1 3/4 equals 2 inches (1+1/2) (3+3/4)\n3. Therefore, A, B, C and D are not likely places where a dog could stand, and the remaining answer has to be one of the two whole numbers (E or F).\n4. Now we have the correct answer - E - because the ball must be lower than the dog's nose, not wider.\n5. So, the dog wants to catch a ball that is more than 3 inches short. We know that 1/4 equals a quarter which is 25% of 100.\n6. Therefore, the answer E = 4 + (25% * 4) = 4.4.\n7.

How many miles does he have to run everyday to lose two more pounds in a month?\n\nRationales:\n1. First, it is necessary to define how many miles does he need to run to lose two pounds.\n2. The initial question stated that Mr. Sanchez has been running for ten miles every day, and has lost about 30 pounds.\n3. The only information that could possibly be omitted is the number of months it took for Mr Sanchez to reach that weight loss.\n4. Thus it can only be the case that Mr. Sanchez ran for 12 months to lose 30% of his body weight in 12-5=7 months.\n5. Therefore it will take Mr. Sanchez 12 more months.\n6. To complete the task, it can be concluded: Mr. Sanchez must run ten miles everyday to lose 2 pounds in 12-2 = 10 more months.\n\nB: 22 months\nC: 11 months\nD: 21 months\nE: 8 months\n\nB: 8 more months\nC: 25%", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "The given question has some numbers that are already provided but are incomprehensible to us unless we figure out how to represent them in terms we can understand. So for example, how long will it take to download the 90 megabyte file initially? Well, if we consider that 90 is equivalent to 10 digits, then it should take 10 seconds. After all, 1 megabyte of information equals 1048576 bytes, which divided by 8 (base 2 decimal system), equals 12901520, which is 8 bytes in the base 10 system, which is approximately equal to one digit. Now, 1290 is approximately 8 digits long but we can assume the file is downloaded in 10 seconds since 1290 divided by 10 gives 129, which is 9 in our base 10 system.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, now that we know that 90 megabytechs is approximately equivalent to 10 sets of 10 digits, we multiply the digits by 10 since there are 1 second, so 90 megabyeches divided by 1290 seconds equals 690 megabytech, therefore this is the total amount of time it will take to download all 90 megabyetches.", "answer": " 15"}

The two rectangles both have different widths:The first rectangle, measuring 4 feet by 6 feet, contains an area of 24 square feet. The second, measuring 2 feet by 4 feet, has an area of 8 square feet.\n  2. The total area of fabric:We are given the combined area of the two rectangles, which is 24 + 8 = 32 square feet. But now we know that the fabric is 16ftx12ft, this would be 192ft2.\n2. To calculate how much of the fabric is cut for each rectangle, we need to look at the dimensions of all options in square feet. The first 2 options are 8.5 feet x 6 feet =45 feet sq. The second 2 are 4.5 foot x 7 feet = 31.5 feet squared. 45/31.5 is 20/11 approx 1.8 is the difference. If you consider a 32ftx192ft of fabric used, the two rectangles that were cut each take 1.8 / 2 =0.9 feet of fabric out of each 24 ft square.\n3. As there were two such cuts, it means 0.9x2 =1.8ft of fabric was taken off each time.\n4. Now considering a cut of 16ftx48ft means each cut is one fourth the length in footage of 16ft by 48ft x 16ft by to get 512 square feet.\n5.

I should have bought $5$ pounds but instead I only bought $3$. We only needed $7$ pounds in the first place. What is the value of the beef?\n\n### Demostration:\n1.  Answer : 80\n2.  The first thing you have to understand is that you only need to buy to solve it\n3.  When buying beef the price is based on the weight of the beef and it's cost is always more expensive than what you originally asked for.\n4.  First let's analyze what we know\n5.  We know that you bought the beef for $8$ and your sister actually bought $4$ pounds of beef.\n6.  After you bought these four pounds you actually had some beef left over so you could have bought another five pounds. But you only bought $3$ extra pounds which meant that you had $6$ pounds left over so after you bought the $4$ pounds of extra beef your balance went from $4$ extra pounds to $6$ extra pounds so now you had to buy an extra $4$ pounds making your actual beef count $16$ pounds, since you originally bought $5$ extra pounds.\n7.  What you must calculate the actual weight of all the beef so you subtract from the weight you actually bought\n8.  I originally bought $3+5=8$ extra pounds which was $4$ pounds of unneeded beef $1$ pound for beef for your sister $1$ pound leftover.

{"text": "The answer to your question is **700 jelly beans in the jar**. I arrived at this answer by counting the amount of jelly beans. The total amount of jelly beams are as follows:\n\nA) 3/4 of the beans are red. Multiplying 3/4 by 400 (3/4 of the total amount jelly beans) gives us 300 jelly beams that are red. So, A+ B gives us 3/4, and we do not get four in the end because we need to subtract 200 (1/4).\n\nB) Multiplying 1/4 by 4  gives us 100 jelly beaches that are coconut flavoured.\n\nC) 750 is one fourth of the quantity jelly beans in total.

Choices:  A) Work  B) Labor  C) Employees  D) Closing E) Hired \nRationales:\n1. To begin, understand the context of the sentence; \"The demolition business was closed\", implies that the business was closed for one day, a Saturday.\n2. Therefore, consider the options carefully with this information in mind.\n3. Option \"A: Work\" seems unlikely to be the answer since the word choice \"work\" indicates a process or action, it does not connote that something was closed.\n4. Options \"B: Labour\" may offer a closer match, but still requires clarification.\n5. \"Labour\" is the noun form of the term \"Labor\"; this might indicate that the work done by personnel is called \"labour\", however, this makes it unclear who or what is being referenced.\n6. Therefore, option C may be the answer, which refers to the employees themselves.\n7. Option D, \"Closing\", is too generic to be the answer, it is not associated with labor or employees\n8. Finally option E \"Hired\" does not refer to the specific closing, rather it is referring to temporary employees hired for specific tasks or duties.\n9. Thus, option C \"Employees\" would fit into the sentence due to the context better than any other option.\n10.

{"text": "The total number of text messages last week and this week was 4911. The method to reach this answer is \n\n### a. Use the rule: The difference between two numbers (A - B) is equal to subtract the larger number from the smaller number and add them up. In this case, A is 111, B is 59, so the answer is 4911 = 111 - 59 + 111 + 59.\n### b. You can first set up the formula for the number of text messages in one week: Total number of text messages in current week = Total number of text messages last+total number of text messages last - twice the total number of text messages in last week. Substitute 111 for the total messages in last week and the answer becomes Total = 111 + (111-111) = 111+0 = 111\n### c. Here the number of texts sent by Keiko is 111. When we subtract the number of texts sent last week (59) from her weekly total we are left with: 111 -59 = 52. Subtract twice that number: 52-52 = 0 and then add that 0 plus 111 = 163.\n### d. To find the combined total number of text messages sent from last week and this week, we have to find the difference between the two: 111-59 = 512(subtract 59 because she sent more this week).

We are given that Benny spent a total of $28 which is not equivalent to $5.50 which means he bought fewer that 5 candy bars which makes sense to us because candy bars are more expensive than soft drinks.

To this, we must add 7 beakers to represent the 8 beakers with Copper ions. \n\nThe first step is to determine the total number of beakers in the room. The only number required for the first step is 22+8.\n\nNow, to find 7, we take the total number of beaker(22+8), and we subtract 22 (the liquid we are looking for without copper ions).\nThat leaves 7 beakers of liquid (with liquid containing Copper ions) of the 8, and leaves 7 beakers in total.\n\nWe find the total by multiplying the final number by 45, which means we get the total number of beakres in the room without copper ions.\n\n7(45)+7(45) = 4x50 \u2248 175 beakers = 20+7 beakers.\n\nThus, when we subtract 20, we get 175 beaker, which equals:\n\nThe answer for the question is 175.\n\n\n### Analysis:\nIn the end, the question asks \n\nThe first thing is to make sure we get the total number, since we are subtracting it in the answer.

Now we can multiply the 25 by 45 to get 225+25(45).\n\n### Lesson:\n\nThis approach is only a quick solution to the maths part.

This is important because it means that he needs to consume 1 more serving to get his 5 servings.  The choice of 15 servings seems most likely considering the 16 choices but also we can assume that the author forgot the extra serving and wrote 16. We don't need to consider this choice and therefore can only have a few options. The problem asks us to find the number of servings he already ate. We know we have 1 servings left and the remaining answer to solve for the number of servings we need to subtract, which is 1. (It isn't specified how many servings have already been eaten) I think that is the best option of this question as others are either not appropriate or more confusing. (The number of servings eaten is not given and we have to come up with 1).\n\n### Step 2,4:\nOnce this is completed, we need to know how many servings he already aformentioned so we can multiply the two numbers together to get the number of remaining calories. So we get\n1+1 = 2\n\nThen we multiply 2 by 110 because we know that there are 110 in every serving.\n### Step 3:\nAfter that, we get\n2 * 110 = 220 which is the number of remaining calorires after eating one additional serving.\n\nThe right answer should be 220 which was our answer because of the context of the question as it said in the last step\n### Step 4:\n\n### Rationale:\nThe only way I came up with", "answer": " 1210"}

{"text": "The answer is 37,000.\n\n### Input for the second part of the question:\nWhen paving 4 miles of road, 6 truckloads of as phalt was needed, and 21 truckloads of as h asphalt can pave each mile, so we will have 6 * 21=126. With 16 miles in the problem and taking into account that each truckload uses 2 bags of gravel, 16 * 2 = 32 and we need 5 truckloads of as p h asphalt, which gives us 5*32=160. All in all, we take the gravel needed for all the truckloads and multiply it by the number of truckloads times 2 (to get 2 in the answer), to solve we get 45+160=205, so we subtract the 95 (160-45) to find the answer. Because 95 > 25, 70 is the difference, in the end, we get 70 bags of gravel. Now we take the gravel we need for one mile of road, which is 32 bags, and multiply it by three because on the third day we use three times 1 mile of road=3, then we multiply all of the bags of gravel that is needed for a mile of road by 5 (for having 5 truckloads). So, we get 5*7*3=75, which means we have 75+32 = 107 bags of gravel for one mile, so we multiply 107 by 3 and we get 321. Then, we know that 321 is half of the pitch because the pitch is 321, so we take the pitch and divide it by 2, which is exactly how much we have on bags of gravel to pave 1 mile, so, multiplying it by 12 miles, we get 169.

John had been saving all year.  He only saved $225 and he does not buy the guitar for a few weeks.

The total loss on his savings is $270.\n\n### Step 1: John saves $30 over the whole year and ultimately decides to wait and does not buy the guitar in the last month of the year.  A better option would be to save $40 (400/0.1) over the full year.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: John saves $1000 and if he only saves for a month he saves $500.

{"text": "To address this task, start by determining the total number of people in line. As there are 84 people in line, this is the numerator, and we are tasked with finding the denominator. Now, we can see that 84 people = 2 groups of 42 people in two separate lines, and the car seating arrangement allows for 2 people per group. \n\nWe can further see that there are 7 cars and 144 people in each car, which is easily divisible by 2, so each car can seat 2 people. We can also write, 144/2=72 people.\n\nFinally, we count the number of times the ride operator runs the roller coaster, which is the numerator, then divide it by the number of people in line, the denominator. \n\nWe count that the ride operator runs the coaster 7 times, so the numerator is 7.

The statement states that out of 50 families in the community, 15 families have 2 dogs.\n3. So, if 2% of the total families (20) have 1 dog, the remaining 75 families have 0.25% of the total no. of families, or 1 dog.\n4. Hence, the total no. of dog owners = (15 x 2) + (20 x 1) + (75 x 1) = 30.\n5. The total no. of families with dogs is equal to the no. of families with 2 or more dogs, i.e. 15 + 20 + 75 = 110.\n6. Therefore, there are 2 dogs and 110 families with dogs in the community.\n7.

Freddie's\nflashlight's is visible at night for a distance that is 3 times\nlarger than Veronica's.\n\n(3) Velma's flashbulb shines at a distance 3 times wider\nthan Freddie's flashbulb. Therefore, her flash would be\nvisible (be seen at a distance) 3 times farther than that\nof Freddie's flash (1080 feet). Velma would be able to see\nVeronica  at a distance of 3600 feet.\n\n(4) Step 2: Velma's flash visible at night\nIt asks us about how far away can we see Veronica. If we\nwant to calculate this distance, we can use geometry, thus\nwe will not need to use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's\nremember that Veronica's distance to us is 3600.\nLet's make a new triangle with sides of V2, FV and V3.\nThe angle and the length are shown in the following diagram.\n\n(5) Now, we need to calculate the distance V3 to Velma's\nflash. \n\n(6) The angle that we can see in the above diagram is\n(V2+V3+FV)/2.

{"text": "110\n\n### Rationales: Input: 3. Then, we can see that each day, the library received an average of 2 visitors. Since it received an average of this number on Monday, it received 50 + 2*2 = 54 visitors on that day. That means that 54 was the total number of visitors that went to the library on Monday.\n### 4. Then, on Tuesday, it received 2*54 = 108 visitors, and on the remaining days of the weeks, it received 20*3 = 60 visitors, which added up to 160, 60 + 60 + 2*T = T3, so T4 should be 55. Using this formula, we can deduce that the total number of visitors received was 51, 54 + 51 + 2*55 + 55 = 110, so the answer is 110.", "answer": " 250"}

From this, we can determine that flowers are not being purchased, but rather a flower garden is being planted, which consists of three things: flowers, a flower pot, and soil.\n2. The sentence indicates that the costs for these three items are $20, $25, and $23 respectively.\n\nStep 1: \n3. The flower pot is more expensive than the flower, so its cost would be the difference in the two costs, $25-$9=$16.\n\nStep 4 - 7\n4. To calculate the expense of the planting of the flowers, our first task is to find the total cost of these three items, which is $23+$16+$9 = $58. The question asked 'How much does it cost to PLANT the flowers', so this would involve subtracting $9 (price of flowers) from $58 (total cost of items). Therefore, $58 - $9 = $49.\n\nStep 8\n5. This $49 is referred to as 'planting' these flowers, so we can say that it costs $49 to plant (flower garden, whatever you wish to call it).\n6. Alternatively, let's say $9 - $25 = -16. So this would mean that even with all these extra costs for flower and pot, it still only took $9 to purchase the flower itself. This means that $42 - $9 = $33 is being spent on soil.\n\nStep 9\n7. So, with three things being planted; flower, pot, and soil - the total it costs to plant the flower garden, comes to $42.\n\n### Input. The book is $5. The notebook is $5. Each is an additional $2.

Since there isn't any option for us. This could only be possible when a material is not distributed equally among them.\nSo, the answer is option 'd'.

Three of these colors are needed, so we know that there are three different colored cartridges but only black-and-white isn't colored.\n\nInput: total\nRationales: In general, if someone buys three colored cartridges of a certain color that costs $32 dollars, that equals to $96 dollars. We need to multiply that by three because each colored cartridge, but black-and white, is $96. When we do the total, we get $194. We then add $27, which is the cost of the black and white cartridge, to that so we get $221 dollars.

But our options seem too broad and could fit any situation from any moment in time, as long as the action was fun, difficult, happened, etc. 3) Answer - Because we are given a limited amount of nouns and verbs, it is likely that we will take the one that fits the most words into the question without having to add on to the question.

{"text": "Linda had $15 at the beginning.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The phrase \"give Linda $5\" implies that Linda already has money.\n- Thus, when the original value of Linda's money is $5, Lucy gives her $5 more. In other words, \"Lucy would have the same amount\" can be interpreted as \"Lucy would still have...\".\n- So when Linda gets $5 as a gift, the overall amount of her money stays the same at $5 + 5 = $10;\n- When Lucy gives her $5, the sum of Linda's fund still stays the same;\n- To sum it up, at the end, Linda still has the original amount of $5 (= Linda's money at the beginning) in addition to the $5 Lucy gave her, so the overall amount of her fund is now $5 + $5 = $10.\n- Therefore, her amount of money at the beginning was $15; namely, $5 + 10, assuming Lucy spent 5$ from her own money (Lucy originally had $20) before making the gift.\n- Therefore, this explains why when Lucy gives her $5 from her original amount, the original sum (original money) is still the same, namely Linda had $10 before; and why when Lucy gives her the $5 extra, the overall amount of Linda's coin grows by $5 since Linda's original fund (Linda's money at that very moment) was $10, and thus she has $15 in total (Linda's original amount + Lucy's gift).\n\n### Question\n\nWrite a short paragraph that summarizes the information in the text below.\n\nI've just found out that the boss gave us two days holiday as a reward for our good work.\n\nHow fantastic!

{"text": "There's a total of 32 pieces of pizza. Bill eats 10 pieces, Dale eats 4 pieces, Ann eats 1.5 pieces and Cate eats 1.75 pieces. There's 1.5 pieces left.\n\n### Feedback:\n  * A good start is to write down what is known about the situation. In this case, we know that there are 4 people, that each person gets 1 personal pan pizza, that each person divides their pizza into 4 pieces, and that each person eats pizza at a percentage of each piece.\n  * Using this information, a logical inference we can make is that each person eats 1 1/4, or 1.25 pizzas, so that each person only leaves exactly 1/4, 0.25, of their pizza behind. So 12 pieces are eaten and 10 are left behind.\n  * In total, there are 20 pizzas. (1 1/4 of 12, and 1) /4= 20\n\n### Solution:\n\n  * For each person, we first know that Bill eats 1 5/8, Dale eats half, Ann eats 3/4, and Cate eats a third.\n  * If we use those percentages to divide the pizzas, each person gets 1 piece every 2 pieces\n\n    * Bill eats 1, 1/8 of 3, 3, for a total of 1 + 3/8 + 3/8 = 4 3/8 pizzas\n\n    * Dale eats 1, and half of 6 = 5 1/2 pizzas\n\n  * Using these results, you can see that the total number of remaining pieces of pizza eaten together is 4 3/4 pizzas.

{"text": "The answer is C: 18.\n\n### Rationales:Input: A person is always required to show their face when going through the gate. Choices: A: A person B: A gate C: A guard D: A man E: A person\nRationales:1. First, let's quickly go through the choices.\n2. A person can be a singular or plural form, so it's clear that this is not the correct choice.\n3. A gate is not a person; you cannot \"go through\" a gate. It's much more likely to be the way in that you \"pass\"; through the gate. This eliminates A, B, and C.\n4. A guard could be a person, but is not required to be. This may be acceptable when there are multiple guards on duty and only one is present at any given moment. Eliminate D.\n5. A man is not necessarily a person. If a \"man\" is a gate-keeper, this rule may have an exemption. Eliminate E.\n6. Let's look at the sentence itself. We can see a subject and a predicate but no punctuation. This means this is a very general statement that covers a lot of ground. \n7. So, the question is asking: If we went through a \"gate\" and we had to do \"it\" then we must show our face. In other words, you should always show your face when going through and gate and must go through any gate that you want to use.\n8. This means that the statement can apply to anyone who is going through the gate. It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman, a child or an elder, or even an animal. There aren't any exceptions. It's a rule. \n9. So the answer choice must be a general term that means \"any\", such as \"person\". A person could be someone with no face at all. For example, a monster or a vampire can be considered a person because it is still a living creature. \n10. There are four answer choices that can mean \"person\" (person, people, men, woman) and of these, the only one that isn't a plural is woman.

Divide this answer by $500 so that you can find out the amount of cash each parent gave the cashier, and then subtract this price from $500.\n\n### Example:\nIf the parents gave the cashier a total of $399 in cash, the cost of the ticket ($200) would be $201 and their children\u2019s discount would be $10; so that their trip would amount to $211.\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: $108\n\n### Demo:\nIn our question it can be proven by elimination that the answer is 54. Option A is ruled out because we assume that the total cost of the amusement park is given in $596 and not $500, which is the amount of money given to the cashier. Option B has been ruled out due to the fact that it cannot fit within the $500 amount given. By eliminating this option, it can be determined that the parents gave the cahier $46.

{"text": "Daniel spent a total of $33, 355.\n\n### Explanation:For this task, we will use a strategy called \"cross multiplying,\" which involves multiplying across many different numbers to solve an equation.\n\n#### First, we can count the total number of video games in his collection because that is required for us to calculate our answer.\n#### Next, we separate into two groups: games that Daniel bought for $10 each and games he bought for any other price.\n#### The total spent on games he bought for $12 is just going to be 80 because every game bought for $12 costs $12 itself.\n#### In addition to the games bought for $12, we also have 17% of other games bought at another price, $6.80 because $3 x 17% = $0.594.\n#### And the remaining 64% of other games bought for other prices, $4.20 because $3 x (64%) = $0.4593.\n#### Thus, Daniel spent $80 (for the number of games he bought for $ 12) + $0.597 (for the number of other games bought at $ 6.80) + $1157 (for the other games bought for other amounts) = 3317.\n#### Or in terms of the total, $12 x 80 + $0.57 x 80 + 346*(64% of $3) =3331.

Instead, we can say that she's likely saying that people should be using the phrase \"thee\" to replace \"there\", as she explains the difference between both words.\n\nOption 'B: practicing': Practicing is another word used for studying. This could be the correct answer if the teacher is talking about practicing how to use the difference between \"thee\" and \"there\". However, considering that she uses the words \"thy\" and \"thine\", she could possibly be encouraging people to practice them as well.\n\nOption 'C: teaching': This option does seem like a correct possibility but requires some further explanation. If the sentence \"Everyone should be teaching how to use the correct words\" is used, then it is likely that it is referring to \"teaching\" as a concept. In other words, it is indicating that people should be teaching each other to use the correct words and that everyone should be involved.\n\nOption 'D: reading': This phrase could be the correct answer, although it can be interpreted in more than one way.

So, their heights are 280cm each.\n\nNow, we can get the math equation: (280 - 80) / 2 = 200, or 2 times 200 is 400cm. This means Bella is 400 times as tall as Anne's sister. This may seem overwhelming, but using the order of operations helps simplify it. We can write 400 as 4 x 100 + 0, so, Bella\u2019s height difference from Anne\u2019s sister is 400 hundredths or, 40cm.\n\n### Next, we can find what percentage of 80 it is by dividing the equation into 2 fractions and then multiplying the answer by 100:\n   (4 times 100 plus zero) / 2 = Bella's height difference from Anne's sister\n(103 over 2) x 100 = 50.65%\nWhen multiplied by 100, this is equivalent to 50.6 percent", "answer": " 200"}

Additionally, Jill's basket capacity is twice that of Jack's, implying that the number of apples needed to fill her basket once it is full will be at least twice as many as the number it would take to fill Jack's basket. \nOutput: To determine the correct answer, we first need to determine how many apples it currently takes to fill Jack's and Jill's baskets. \nOutput explanation:\nExplanation: From the given information, it is evident that Jill's bakset can hold twice as much amount of apples as a full one. Hence, this is one way we can determine the total number of apples Jill's basket has to take in before it is filled. \nOutput: In order to use this information, we can subtract Jill's capacity (2x the current amount) and divide it by the current amount.  \n \nOutput explanation:  \nThis will give us a ratio of 2/1. But since we are subtracting twice the amount on the top, this tells us there will be 1 left over. Hence, the baskets will have 1 less in after they are each filled with 12.  \n \nThe same logic can be applied to Jack's basket. Hence, the bakset that can hold twice the amount as full, can now hold 2(12) or 24 apples. \nOutput: Hence, this gives us the answer for each basket.

We can consider there are 7 weeks in a month (this is just an approximation, to be precise we actually need to divide 365 days by 14 weeks, but 7 is a standard assumption for approximating a month). The bill for a single week is given by,\n```\n$50xn => 50n => 25n\n```\nThis is because every single customer will be charged with a fixed price = 50 which is shared with an n people.\nThe total amount of the bill for 7 weeks is,\n```\n$200 => 25n => 8n\n```\nAs this makes sense since there are 50 customers every week.\n\nThere are 8n people because, in one week, we can accommodate 8 customers because if we have say, 3 customers, we can't make more than 8 calls. So, total number of people in one month must be equal to total numbers of calls = 300 = 8n\n\nFor example if on one week, we had 4 calls, then the next week we also had 4 calls as well(and so on). Therefore, the total bill for one month is,\n```\n8x(8n) => $640 => 25xn\n => n is $640/25 = 25.6 \n```\nNow this is easy, total weekly bill = 50 customers * 50 cents= $2,500(divided by 10 working days = $2,50 to cover the whole month.", "answer": " 600"}

Mabel has 5 x ( as many marbled as Katrina ) \u2013 12x ( twice as many marbled as Amanda )\n\nHence, solving for Mabel\u2019s marbled, it is evident that Mabel has 97 marbled.

{"text": "There were nine girls that could not make it.\n\n### Answer: This solution is inaccurate because\n\n### Explanation:\nWe want to find how many of the eight boys were on the minibus. \n\nSince there were a total of 18 students assigned to the minibus, one of 18 students had to be either a girl or a boy, either the eighth boy or ninth girl. Because the count of boys and girls was the same the eighth boy had to be the ninth girl. This makes the total number of girls (that could have been on the minibus) nine. This is the reason there were nine girls that could have been on the trip but weren't able to make it.

{"text": "Answer the following math question.\n\nA.  Rationales:We must first determine the gender of each family member before answering the question\nRationales 1. The question asks about a specific family that consisted of both boys and girls, but there was also \"each girl received an egg.\" The first step to figuring out how many boys there were is understanding how many girls there were.\n2. We have three \"answers\" in total, they are \"A,B,C\", but each \"answer\" is really both the numbers and the letters. For each answer we have 7 girls, and each girl got 1 egg. The first set of numbers is an unknown \"answer\", i.e the number of girls. We can think about which answer had the same number of girls, and then try to make sense of the remaining numbers.\n3. Because we have 7 girls and 1 egg for each one, we have 7+1=8 eggs.\n4. In the second set of numbers there are letters, and letters only correspond to the number of eggs, we can use the letters to write down how many eggs each one got.\n5. We can see in the second set of numbers that each boy got 5 eggs, and there are a total of 8 eggs between all of them (7 girls + 5 boys).\n6. The second set of numbers reveals that there are 5 boys.\n7. So the final answer is A: five boys.\n\n## Task 2\nBelow are statements, each with two blank spaces.

{"text": "Option 1: 35 inches\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: In this question, we need to calculate the average height for 3 individuals - Daisy, Parker, and Reese.\nRationales:\n1. First, we start with the information given: \n   - Parker is 4 inches shorter.\n   - Daisy is 16 inches taller.\n   - Reese is 6 inches taller. \n2. This gives us some values as shown below:\n   - Dais: 38, Parker: 34, Reese: 44\n3. Hence from Reese's height, the height of the others can be calculated as follows:\n   - Diasy/2 = 34 \n   - Reese-Parker = 44-34 = 10\n   - (Diasy/2) + Reese-Park = 10\n4. It's important to understand that if Reese is 64 inches tall, the average height in this case is 42 inches = 41/(1+2)\n5. So, we must subtract 41 from the calculated height to get the average height.\n6. Now we have the following:\n    - Parker\u2019s height: 34 - 41 = 7\n    - Reese\u2019s height: 64 - 41  = 23\n7. Now we substitute the value we got for Parker in the same equation to calculate Daisy\u2019s height:\n    - Daisy = 34 + Reese's value - 41\n8. Multiplying the denominator by 2 gives us the following:\n    = 108/315\n9. Adding this to the numerator gives us Daisy\u2019s full height: \n    = 56/85\n10. After putting the three heights together we get an average height:\n    - Avg = (34+7)+(64-23)\n    - = 100 / 315\n11.

{"text": "The correct response is: $3023.\n\nInput: In the mornings, he often walked to the office wearing dark dress shoes, which was usually a good choice; on the other hand, in the afternoon he\u2019d sometimes slip into the office wearing slacks, which was more casual but not always inappropriate. Choices:  A. Inappropriate B. Good choice C. Bad choice D. Casual but not always inpropriate\nRationales: What is the difference between choice A, Inappropriate, to the correct choice B, Good choice?\n1) He always does not make mistakes but sometimes makes mistakes\n2) The term 'casual' in the English language can be used to describe clothing that is neither formal nor informal, however formal or informal the situation might be. However, this is not the same in the Japanese language. Here, the term used for \u2018casual\u2019 is \u300c\u304a\u305d\u308d\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3044\u300d, which does not mean \u2018neither formal nor informal\u2019 but rather \u2018informal\u2019. As it is defined as \u2018informal\u2019 in Japan, inappropriate is a better choice.\n3) When describing a Japanese sentence in English, you need to find a proper English word that can be used to describe the \u6587\u8108 to make it sound natural in the English language. Casual in this case is used to refer to the context of the situation. \u300c\u304a\u305d\u308d\u300din this context does not necessarily refer to the clothing.\n4) There are two kinds of clothing that describe \u2018formal\u2019 in the English language. The first is formal wear, which means some specific types of clothes that are worn for official or social events, such as a suit. The second is formal style, which refers to the clothing itself, such as a coat of clothes or a dress. There are a lot of types of clothing that can be referred to as formal style, such as business wear, evening dress, and suits. Thus, casual here is referring to the second kind of formal style, therefore \u2018casual but not always inproportiate\u2019 is a better choice. \n\nAnswer: D.

How many books does Roselyn has before giving away all those books?\n\n### Demostraton:\nInput: Rebecca and Roselyn give Mara three times as much books as they give Rebecca. Roselyn remained at 60 books and Rebecca got 40 books.\n\nOutput: A: 60 books\n\n# A: 60 B: 72 C: 66 D: -1 E: -50\n\n# Answer: A: 66 books\n\n### Justification: A: The number of books is given, 60. But we know from the other options that the number is divisible by three, which is Roselyn's multiplication factor. We can also eliminate that the number is divisble by one because in that case there would be 60% books.\n\n### Rationale A: One book can be used 3 times, or 3 books can be used once. That's why 1/3=5/6. To write a number as divisible by three, write 1 as the denominator and put six in front of the number. For example, for the number 216, you would divide the number by any division of 1, which, in this case, would be 6 as a divisor. It is important to remember that one third (1/3) is equal to a sixth (5/6), which is why 2/6 (the fraction that represents a 3 in denominator) is exactly equal to 1/3.\n\nB: Multiply each whole number by 2.33 to make it divisible by 3. You'll get 72, 66, 63 and 99. That will be our set of answer.\n\nC: Multiply each option by 2.3 and again 2.3. Divid 2.3 by 3, you'll get the fraction of 0.66, so 0.66 x", "answer": " 220"}

Second, the sentence uses the plural pronoun \"their\" when referring to standard care patients. As a result, the correct option should be \"their\".\n\nAnswer: Choices: Choices:\n   A: theirs 11 (incorrect)\n   B: standard care  (incorrect)\n\nInput: After completing a report, the employee is free to do what? Choices: A: go home B: meet coworkers for coffee C: take time off D: work remotely\nRationales: The first thing we need to do is determine what a report is. A report is an official document that summarizes data and presents it to management, clients, or other individuals. To prepare a report, an employee would need to research data, gather resources, and write content for the report.\n\nOnce the definition of report is established, we can begin evaluating the alternatives. Answer Choices:\n\nA: go home means to leave work to go home in order to rest, relax, or pursue leisure activities. After finishing work, the employee is free from work responsibilities and can do whatever they want; thus, it is not the answer. \nB: meet coworkers means to hold a meeting between two or more people, possibly for a social purpose. Therefore, it will affect the employee\u2019s work and cannot be their first choice.\nC: take time off is an option that could apply to the employee, but this answer choice does not give enough detail or clarity regarding the timing or conditions to be the answer. This is usually when employees are working during the standard workday and want to relax or have their own time off.\nD: work remotely means that the employee can conduct work duties and manage projects from an alternative location (e.g. their home). Remote work is not always necessary to finish a report, as the employee can work remotely from their office or workplace. Therefore, this option is not the answer.  \n\nIn conclusion, among the options present, C: take time off is the only option that is appropriate", "answer": " 64"}
{"text": "Answer by using the process of elimination\n\n1. If we add the total number of the buyers in the three days, then it's `350`.\n2. We can eliminate option A as the total number of the days, i.e. 40 - 15 = 25.\n3. If you take the 40 from option A, then option D is also not an answer because we can't have a bigger number than 125 (3.5 - 2.5 =1.0 - 1.5 = 0.5).\n4. You can also verify the 40 - 240 = (-190)\n5. We can also eliminate option B as the total number of buyes, since the previous 45 + 60 + 45 = 156 and it's greater than 180.\n6. If we take `8 + 2/3` of the option B, then we can't have 126.5 (311/2 - 180/2)\n7. At this point we consider option C, which is the total number of buyrs in the three days, and we calculate it as 36/3 - 18 = 7.5 - 6 = 1.5\n8. Now, we can confirm that the total number of buyres in the three days were 7.5, as there were 7.5 - `5/2 + 10/2 + 5/2 = 7.5`\n9. Therefore, we can confirm that answer D, i.e. Total number of buyrs = 156\nAnswer: D: 156\n\n### Input(s): What should we do with the pine cones left over after decorating the Christmas tree?

{"text": "Gary worked 60 extra hours that week.\n\n### Rationales:\nFor the first sentence:\n\nGary's is working for a lot of extra hours to fill in for sick people. He is working more than 35 hours a week to earn overtime wages. Extra shifts mean extra hours. Therefore, Gary worked 60 extra shifts that week.\n\nIn the second sentence, he worked 52 hours to be at $696.

Choices: \nA: fridge B: stove C: grill D: oven\nRationales: This question is asking us to find the temperature in the kitchen. There are many things or appliances/equipment that are in the kitchen. The question is very specific in which particular temperature he is referring.\n\n1) Look at the different options and eliminate those that are not a part of the specific appliance that is mentioned in the sentence. They are:\n2) Eliminate B) stove, since the question asked about \"temperature of the kitchen\", the stove is located outside of the kitchen.\n3) Eliminate C) grill, since the question asked us about the temperature of the kitchen. Grills are cooking aids and not appliances (as mentioned by the question), and they are not used in a kitchen.\n4) The Oven is the appliance of use in the kitchen, given that it is the area where food is cooked/baked, and therefore the food is kept in the oven.\n5) D) Grill is also being eliminated because it is not a part of appliance usage in a kitchen.\n6) Only A: the fridge, is kept inside the kitchen, which gives rise to the possibility that the fridge is the one being talked about, therefore increasing its probability of being chosen as the correct answer.\n7) So by looking at all the options, and considering the context of the question we came to conclusion that the answer is A: the fridge.\n8) Now let's look at", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": "The club bought 3 containers of lemon juice, 2 containers of mango juice, 3/8 containers of orange juice\n\nThe key to answer this question is using the total number of members and the fraction.

We then sum up the remaining amount of people to get the total number of people that bought one portion.\n\nBy working through the question, we get:\n\nTotal amount of members = 30\n\nTotal amount of lemon = 2/5 of 30 = 6\n\nWe can get the amount of each kind of portions easily by substituting 2/5 and then 1/3. We can then sum up the amount of members who bought each kind of juices (lemon, mango, and orange):\n\nlemon: 6 + 15 = 21\n\nmango: 12 + 8 = 20\n\norange: 4 + 4/8 = 3\n\nThis means that 10 members bought orange, and the rest were split between lemon and mango:\n\nlemon: (6 + 21) = 27\n\nmango: (12 + 20) = 32\n\norange: (3 + 3) = 6\n\nA club with 32 members drinking Orange juice:\nlemon: 27 members\nmango: 32 - 32 = 0 members (since it is Orange)\norange: 6 members\n\nWe get:\n\nlemon = 27 : 27 :32\nmango = 0 : 27 : 32\norange = 6 : 27: 32\n\nIf we want to know how many members bought orange juice, we will substract:\n\nlemon : 27 - 0 = 27\nmango : 27 : orange - 6\norange : 6: orange - 6\n\nThe total amount of members who bought orange juice:\n\n6 + 12 + 6 - 1 = 19\n\nAs a conclusion, 19 people bought orange juice, 19 people did not buy orange ju", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "The two stuffed animals cost $2.10.\n### Explanation:To solve this problem, we first determine the cost of each of the four items:\n1. The magnet ($3 x 3 = $9)\n2. The sticker ($2.25)\n3. The two stuffed animals ($4.50)\n4. And Tish's total purchase ($30.00)\n5. From there, we can calculate the ratio of prices, starting with the cost of the magnet. To do this, we divide $9 by the total price of $30 to obtain the ratio of $3/5, representing 60%. By cross-multiplying the dividend (60%) by the divisor (the price of a single unit of the item) we can evaluate the ratio of prices for each item.\n6. These products are then simplified to the following:\n7. $9/30 = 9/20 = 1/5 (The price of the magnet as a ratio of total cost of $30)\n8. $2.25/30 = 25/20 = 75/100 (The price of the sticker as a ratio of total costs of $30) \n9. $4.50/30 = 45/20 = $3 (the price of two stuffed animals as a ratio of total purchase cost of $30).\n10. Finally, we can compare the ratios of each item to the last:\n11. $1/5 = $3/5 = 30/50 (The price of a single unit, magnet vs. total purchase cost) \n12. $75/10 = 7 5/10 = $3.75 (The price of a sticker vs. a single unit) \n13. $3/20 = $4.50 / $30 = $4.67 (Stuffed animals vs. purchase cost)\n14. Based off this comparison, we can use the final term as the numerator, or top, of the fraction, leaving the denominator, or bottom, variable.\n15. As for the denominator, we know that 50/30 is $2.1 (60%)", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "Jack would be able to return at least $3,050 dollars worth or gift cards back after sending the IRS the code for the first Best Buy gift card.\n### Demonstation:\nThe problem here is a word problem, and can be solved using various mathematical methods. But for the purpose of this exercise, we will use the method of subtracting amounts. This will be our way of answering the question, \"How many $X gift cards can I return?\". \n\nTo do this, we need to understand what the question is asking. The question is asking \"How many $Xs worth of gift cards can I return?\" The \"6 $500 gift cards and 9...\" in the question are irrelevant and we can ignore them. So, all that matters for the task are the $500 and the $200 gift cards.\n\nThe question is asking us to \"return\" the gift cards and to assume that the scammer actually did return the gift cards to us, this will be our starting point of the problem. \nThe gift cards say they are $500 and $200 each. We understand from the question that we can return a certain amount of gift cards at each value.\n\nFor example, if I return one gift card valued at $500, then I am \"returning\" the following amount $500. \nIn a general sense, the problem is asking us to take a given amount of gift cards that we assume have been given back to us and return that to the same starting value of $500 and then also to the previous gift card return value of $200 - which is called $700.  \nHence, the question is asking us do:\n$500+$200=$700?\n\nLet's start by substituting 5 to make the process easier to work with.\n500+200=700\n\nCan you see the pattern yet? Lets substitute the 5 with another number:\n50+200=$7\n\nCan you see how to do it now?\n\nThe problem, at each stage, asks you to return the gift cards you have given to the value that you started with.

{"text": "Answer the following grade question.\n### Rationales:\n1. To start, it's important that you have a good understanding of all the terms and how they are used in context within this problem. \n2. The words can be broken down as follows:\n1. \"Parking garage\" - a parking facility within a structure, with multiple levels or floors.\n2. \"Nora's house\" - used to refer to \"house\" as a general reference, such as to describe location or proximity.\n3. \"Level\" - a floor or storey in a \"parking garage\"\n4. \"Spots\" - places or spots where \"cars\" can be parked \n5. \"Open\" - a spots is open if it is available for use / car parking\n6. \"Full\" - when a spots is full, it means a car is parked there, and is no longer open or available to park another car.\n3. The problem is describing how a car parking facility, in this case a parking garage, is organized. \n4. To organize something means to control or arrange an aspect of it. \n5. This can be seen in the problem whereby there \"are 100 sp\" on each \"levl\" \"in the \"parking garage\".\n6. So based on this information we can begin to form an idea of the distribution of the number of spots across the levels. There are 5 levels shown in the problem, so assuming that there is a uniform distribution pattern, we could represent the number of spots on each level using the following equation: \ud835\udc360 + \ud835\udc361 + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4f +... + \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5f\ud83c\udc31 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5b+ (\ud835\udc5f\ud82d\uded7\ud835\udf00) \ud835\udc5b\n7. So looking at the provided information we know that: \n8. \"There are 100 spaces per level.\" - So this means that each floor should have 100 sp \"total\" \"on that level.\"\n8. \"There is 1 more open parking space on the second level than the first level.\" - So this implies that level 2 should", "answer": " 186"}

{"text": "### Rationales:\n\nStep 1: First, identify the task and the information given for the task. In this example, the task is to estimate the number of remaining tiles by taking into account the number of blue and red tiles present. The information given is that the pool has 48 more blue tiles and 12 blue tiles to be added 50% more remaining tiles.\n\nStep 1B: Secondly, the choice of blue and red tilles is a logical alternative to consider. In this case, the number of blue tiles in the pool is 48 plus 12 (the total of 60), while the number of red tiles is 32.\n\nStep 4A: Next, determine how many blue tiles plus how many Red Tiles would fulfill the demand of 100 tles. From the options, it can be concluded. To determine how many blue ties plus how many red ties are needed, we can begin by subtracting the number of blue ties (the pool's current number of blue ties, 48) from the demand of 12+40=100+12=112. Therefore, 112 is the total number of remaining tiles needed.

The question is to determine how many pages Coral would need to finish the book in three weeks, which can be established by analyzing the number of pages read and the remaining pages.\n2. To begin, we first need to understand the meaning of the word \"pages\" to determine if it refers to individual pages or the entire book.\n3. Since the context of the sentence is about reading a book, which implies each page must be read one at a time, it is likely that the word \"pages\" indicates each page and not the entire book.\n4. Now let's look at the information provided in the sentence and its relation to the question.\n\nLet N denote the number of pages in the book, and x is the portion of the book that was finished in week1.\nLet y be the portion of the book left in week2, and z be the portion of the remaining pages that was finished in week3.\n\n\\$\\begin{align*} N &=600 \\\\\\\\ x+y+z&=300 \\end{align*}\\$\n\nNext, we can evaluate each term to get:\n\\$\\begin{equation*} N=600 \\end{equation*}\\$\n\\$\\begin{eqnarray*} x+y+z &=&300 \\\\ x+2y+z &=& 300  \\end{eqnarray*}\\$\n\\[\\begin{equation*} x+2y+300-z = 300 \\end {equation*}\\]\nNow we divide each term by 300 to remove the -z part from the rest since it is equal to 300.\n\\$\\begin{aligned} & \\frac{x+2y}{300}, &\\frac{z}{300} \\end{aligned}\\$\n\\$\\[\\begin{equation*} z=\\frac{x+2(y)}{300} \\quad\\text{and} \\quad x+2y=300\\text{-z} =300(1+\\frac{2}{300}) \\end {equation*}\\)\n\nTherefore, in week three, Coral would need to read:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{600(1+\\text{2/30", "answer": " 210"}

Let h be the present age of Jed and M be the present age of Matt.\n### M=h\nM+10=h\n10=h-t\nh=10-t\nH=h-t\nThis is a simple arithmetic calculation. \n\n###Input: The carpet should be vacuumed daily to stay clean and healthy, but it is a very tedious task. Choices:  A. dauntingB. a hassle C. both D. neither E. a painful process\nRationales:\n\n1. We know the carpet needs to be vacuumed daily for its cleanliness and health, and it's implied that vacuuming is a tedious task.\n\n2. We're looking for words that describe tedious tasks, so we can eliminate \"a breeze\" (which means easy) and \"a snap\" (which means simple).\n\n3. We can similarly eliminate both \"both\" (because if something is a tedious task, it can't also be the opposite of a tedious task) and \"neither\" (because everything is either A or B).\n\n4. This leaves us with these options:\n\n- Both A and B are phrases that would describe tedious tasks, and B can also be considered the opposite of D.\n\n5. We therefore know C is incorrect, but D and A and B aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, so we need to narrow down the options further (because you can have a tedious task that's also a hassle).\n\n6. E isn't an accurate description of the sentence because vacuuming would be a tedious process, but it also requires a certain level of effort.\n\n7. A and B are used to describe tedious tasks, whereas C and E are used to describe the general act of vacuuming, and D is using process to modify tedious.\n\n8. We can see that both A and B provide accurate answers to the question. Therefore, the option that's the most appropriate is B: \"a tedious task\".\n\nAnswer: B: a tedious task.", "answer": " 20"}

Since he sells them back at $500, the number of books must be one more than 8.\n```\nTherefore, the books are 9, and by adding the 20 to the 500, the correct amount lost to buyback is $-100 which rounds to -105.\n```\nIt's important to realize first that he didn't end up with any profit and to always determine what the exact amount is lost or made when doing math for situations like these.\n\nAnswer: $ -105", "answer": " 220"}

{"text": "To get the answer for the question, the first thing we have to do is to replace all the phrases, \"which was\" into \"which are\" since all the options are the answer and it means we must count how much each boy whitewashed. So, we can use \"which are\" and \"which aren't\".\n\n### Demostration:\nFirst,we have to write down the question we were given and read it once again. Here you have:\nTom Sawyer has trickted his friends into whitewasing Aunt Polly 100-fet fence. His first frind, Ben, whitewash 10 feet. HIS second friend, Billy whitewas a fifth of the remainingfence. A third frind, Johnny  whitewas a thirtd of the fence that were left after that.\nWhich still needs to be whitewased.\n\n### Our initial steps:\nSince the question has a lot of info given, first, we have to summarize it and put it together to be easily answered. here you will find a summarized question.\nHow many fence still need to be whitewashed.\n\n### To answer it just read from the top and count.\n\n### Summary:\nHere is the answer 80 * 1/5 + 22 + 30 = 370ft/100 Ft= 3.7Ft/ft\n\n### Rationale :\n\nThe steps for answer:\n\n1.

Let's see the question again : how many feet still remain to be whitewashed on the 100-pfeet fence.\n4. So the answer should be the final number or the total number after we add all the numbers which is 3.7 Ft.\n5.

D. 24 pints E. 1 pint\nRationales: This question has multiple parts. First, the question requires us to recognize that the man needs to drink at least 8 pints of \"beer per day\"; \"per day\" indicates that the man should drink this much alcohol every day of the week. \"Then\" indicates that the man's heart is unsatisfied with his drinking and that he should increase his alcohol consumption. It is unclear what the actual volume of the 8 pints per day is, but we know that it should be divided over 5 days of the week.\n\n1. This provides us with a constraint that the man should drink one pint of beer daily. The question does not provide us with the actual units, so it is unclear what the exact amount of beer the man should drink daily.\n2.

Squirrel can steal half a cup of bird seed every week (in other words, squirrel only takes the half of a cup the bird feed can hold 14/2=7 half cups =7/2 = 3 and half cups that squirrel steals, but half a cup is 1/2)\n\nThe bird seeds should make 3 and half cupper after squirrel stole half a cup. \n\nThen, 3.5 is needed to feed 14 birds for the next week in the same time (according to the passage, half birds could be fed without bird seed because bird seed was stolen by squirrel).\n\nThen add 1 more to feed the bird since the birds always want more bird seeds (according to the phrase \"every week, he has to fill the emptied feer with bird seed,\" the birds need to be filled every week because birds starve easily)\n\n`(14+1)/(3.5+1)` = 14/5 = 2.8\n\n12/2.8 = 4\n\nSo, you can answer the `4`\n\nInput: 2.00.01 is rounded to whole numbers or integers.\nInput: A box with a volume of 106.83 litres was measured to be completely full.\nInput: A cube of 0.92 square meters", "answer": " 21"}

For example, if you went to a comedy show with your friends, you would use this word to describe that it was hilarious. The definition is literally \u201ccausing laughter.\u201d For example, when a joke causes laughter, it is hilarious. You could also use this to describe a funny person\u2019s humor, or a film that you thought was very funny. In this case, the meaning remains unchanged. \n\n### Response\nThe word \u201chilarity\u201d is defined as \u201cthe state of being funny\u201d or \u201ccausing laughter\u201d.\nThe first option says the word \u201chilariously\u201d can be used to refer to something that is very fun. This makes sense, as there is no other better word to describe anything so laugh-inducing.\nThe second option says \u201cHilarious means \u2018very funny\u2019. For example, \u2018a hilarious standup comedian\u2019\u201d. This makes sense because the word hilarious is used to refer to someone or something that causes laughter and fun.\nThe third option has the same definition as the second. This is not a surprising occurrence as most of the words that describe laughter are the same.\nThe fourth option is different; it refers to the comedy show in which someone has made you laugh. This definition is incorrect. It was meant that you had made someone else laugh. \nThe fifth option is the last to be discussed as it is correct and fits", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "James pays $1000.\n\n### Rationale for answer choice:  By using the given information on how many units James takes in 1 semester and how many units are in 1 semester, the student is then able to see why this is the correct choice.  To start with, I took the units that James takes each semester and multiplied that by 2, to show how many units he was going to take each semester in 12 weeks.  \n\n### Using this logic, I was then able to plug in the numbers I had in the equation.  I started with 20 units and multiplied that 20 by 2 and then I got that 40 units.  Then I took that 40 and multiplied it by the cost of each unit (50), to determine the total cost for two semesters.  Therefore, I would be charged for 50 units, which would amount to $2500 and then I would have to be charged the same amount for the next 12 weeks. \n\n### So it is safe to assume that James would be charged $2500 twice.  Therefore James was going to be charged $5000 at the end of the 12 weeks in which he went to school.  But since he is going to go to school for 2 semesters, this would add up to $10,000 total.\n\n### Answer:  $10,080\n\n### Input For a math problem.\n\n###  You have $3.50.

How much money did you spend on bananas?

In addition, the sentence states that the man is very \"handsome\", which means he is very attractive and good looking.\n* Step 2: This provides us with a list of potential choices, all of which describe handsome or attractive.\n* Step 3: Based on the context, we can eliminate options A, B, E, and F since they do not accurately convey \"handsome\" and instead describe handsome in general.\n* Step 4: Option C can be eliminated because it is much less specific than the rest of the choices and is also redundant.\n* Option G is more general than the other options and does not describe \"handsome\" specifically.\n* We can then reach the conclusion the man was very attractive and good-looking. This means that the answer is C: very handsome.\n* Thus, option C is the only choice that conveys the specificity of 'handsome'; as a result, the right answer is C: very attractive and goodlooking.\n\nAnswer: C: very attractiveand goodlooking\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite a response that appropriately replaces the underlined segment.\n\n### Directions: A: box B: apparent\n\n### Instractions: Where does the machine get so intricately?\n\n### Direction: B: Apparatus\n\n### Instructiions:\nWhere do you get petrol for your car?\n\n### Direction: E: Gas Station\n\n### Instrtuctions:\nWhere is a good TV to watch?\n\n### Directiion: D: Bedroom\n\n### Instrtutitons:\nWhere a TV can be used at night?\n\n### Diirection: D: Bedroom\\\n\n### Insturctions:\nThe knowledge can be expensive to obtain.\n\n### Directiion: A: Universitty\n\n### Instrructions:\nWhat are most people using to find knowledge?\n\n### DIrectiion: D: classroom", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "2.25\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe amount of time per task hasn't changed - Matt still has the same prep, bake and decorate time. However, with the change in oven time (1.5 + 1.5 instead of 1 + 2), it ends up changing everything else, with Matt doing more of each step.  It doesn't take Matt as many minutes to make 2.25 cakes (1 + 2.5).  Instead it takes 1.25 cakes.\n\nIt is helpful to look at Matt's time at each task to figure out how much time to assign to each, because we know the time to prepare, bake, and decorate each cake.\n\nThis means Matthew's prep time increased by 0.25 hours (1.8 + 2.5) = 4.3.\n\nMatthew's baking time increased by 1 hour (1 + 2) = 3, Matthew's baking time total per hour 3/3 = 1, Matthew's bake time/h = original 1, so 1.25 / 1 = 1.25.\n\nMatt's decorating time increased by 0,3 hours (.75 + 1) = 1.75.\n\nThis means that overal in terms of minutes, the increase was 1.75/.25 = 7. Matt's time to make 2.17 cakes = 18 minutes.\n\n### A second solution for the given data:\n\n1. The time to get everything assembled = 4.3 minutes (assume it takes the same amount of time to get everything ready for the cakes).\n\n2. The time to bake the cake: 3.25 minutes (half of the baking time). This is because his decorating time is twice as long (10 minutes/2 = 5 minutes at decorating).\n\n3. The time to decorate each cakes: 7.5 minutes (double the time to decorate).\n\nThis means that Matthew's total time to make 2 cakes = 15.05 minutes (4.3 + 3.25 + 7.5 = 15", "answer": " 5"}

How many lobsters did the fisherman drop into the can? Choices: 5 6 A7 : B B5: C B6 D B7 E B8 \nRationales:Step 1: It can be initially established that the number of lobsters dropped into the can is equal to the amount of lobsters dropped + lobsters left inside the can.\nStep 2: This means that we only need to know the initial weight of 6.6 pounds, and the weight of the contents in the can of 1.2 pounds.\nStep 3: Since the weight of the contents is only 1 pound, we can subtract to find the weight of each lobster (1 - 1 = 0 -1 = 1).\nStep 4: This means that every lobster weighs 6.6/4 pounds, which is 1.6 pounds.\nStep 5: Since the lobster weights 6.6 pounds which are 2 cans, each lobster weigh 3 cans.\nStep 6: We can subtract that information to find the final answer: (6.6 - (6.6 divided by 4) = 6.6/2*6.6 = 13.2) we know that there are 13.2 lobsters left inside.\nStep 7: The only information left is the extra weight of the sardine can which weighs", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "The answer is:\n### The correct answer is 52 feet 12 inches.\n\n### Here is how I figure out the answer\nWe are given 8-foot, 20-foot, 3 2-foot ropes, and a rope length of 7-foot. We understand we do not know how many knots he made but from the information given it is pretty easy to estimate. The number of pieces can be assumed at around 17.\n\n### If he tied two 9-foot pieces of rope together it would not stretch to 18 feet but 18+1=19.2 feet which is not 1 foot longer than 18 feet. so we don't have to worry about what 9 foot ropes will stretch to. so in total he will have 17 rope lengths.\n\n### Then we have to do the part where he loses 1.2 feet per knot.\nThere are roughly a total of 17 knots in each one of the long ropes.\nSo that means he will lose 1.2foot per knot 17 times. Which = approx 1.2 feet + approx 4,4 feet or roughly 5 1/2 feet per each short rope.\n\n### So when we know how many feet we are losing per each rope, we can just subtract that from how long the rope is so on how long the rope gets by how long we are losing.\n52 - 5 1/5 = 46 1/5 + 8 = 52 1/5.\n\n### The next last part is just figuring the 1/5th of 12 inches. We don't really know the exact dimensions of the rope or inches. In 12 inches, \u00bd inch makes a quarter inch difference, which is 0.67 inches total. So the final part is just adding a quarter inch for 3 ropes + 1/12th of six inches for 3 knots + 3/24 of 12 inches for 7 3/4 inches = 0 1/24th or 10 thousandth.\n\n### Final answer - rounded = 52 feet 52 and 1", "answer": " 35"}

Fill in the blank with a number.\n   2.  One choice refers to the specific slice of food that was eaten.\n\nLooking at the first choice (A: 5), it's implied that 5 slices were left. However, this leaves us with the other four choices, which are not the correct.\n\nLooking then at choice (B: 12) is about the number of slices left over when there is one slice left for each person, which does not match the question, therefore, choice (B) cannot be the right answer for this question.\n\nSimilarly, looking at choice (C: 2) is about the slices remaining for each person after they have each eaten two slices, which does not meet the question. So choice (C) cannot be the right choice.\n\nNow looking at choice (D:33), we see that this relates to a fraction representing the amount remaining, which can be interpreted as slices if we translate it as follows: \"2 divided by 12\". This fraction of 2/12 represents a fraction which is equivalent to 1/6, or one sixth of the total number of total slices. \n\nConcluding, a sixth of the total number is equivalent to 12 divided by 6, which can be equated to 2/3. This means that 2/3 of the total number, represented by 2/3 of 24 (24 being the total number of slices before the 36 were created) is equivalent to 16, which is the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer choice can be chosen as choice (D: 16).\n\nAnswer: D: 16\n\nInput: My cousin in Australia has gotten a few roles in movies. Who said he was who?

{"text": "The first step is to formulate the question mathematically by converting the physical quantities into their corresponding values in terms of mathematical notations. The pool's volume will be denoted as v, which is equivalent to 60 gallons. The rate of filling the pool with water will be denoted as f, which is the same as R (rate in gallons per minute) and t(in minutes). \nThe rate at which water leaks from the pool is denoted as leaks, which is the same in values. The formula you need to use is \ud835\udc61=\ud835\udc62/\ud835\udc63, where \ud835\udc61 is time, \ud835\udc62 is the number of gallons of water per minute, and \ud835\udc63 is the rate of fill or water in. We can also convert this into \ud835\udc61 =\ud835\udc62/(\ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc62 ). \nSubstitute the variables, the water in comes to 60 \u00d7 1.6 (the rate of adding water), we get 96 gallons. Substitute it in the equation, and solve for time: 96 gal = 96 / (60+96 gal) and solve for t.\n(96) / (60+156) = t. \nThen, divide both sides by 60: t = 96/156 = 0.6 hr.\nAnswer:  There are 30 minutes in an hour (30), 60 minutes in an hour and a half, then use the 15 minute for the equation:\nt = 96/ (60\u00d730) = 96/3600 \u2248 26.735 seconds\n\nAnswer: 26.7 seconds. \n\n### Note: Don't forget to round after using scientific notations.", "answer": " 40"}

First, we can look at the number of stamps Bella has in total, which is, as we've already seen, 18.\n\nNext, we look at how many snowflakes Bella has. This is 11 because she started with that number. Then, we look at how it relates to other stamps. Bella has 9 more trucks than she has snowflakes, so that means she has 20 total trucks.\n\nSo far, it looks like Bella has bought: 18 snowflakes, 11 rose stamps (because that's how many trucks she bought), and 20 trucks.\nNow, we need to look at the last piece of this puzzle. Bella has 13 fewer roses than trucks. We can simplify that into 20 truck stamps - 13 less 13 = 7. So, Bella has 11 snowflakers and 11 trucks, and trucks are a total of 22, which means she has 22 trucks in her 18 total stamps.\n\nNow, looking backwards, we can deduce that the final number of stamps Bela has overall is 18, each of which is 11 snowfalkes, 11 truck, and 22 total trucks. We know the number of each type of stamp", "answer": " 38"}

{"text": "The car has traveled 20 meters farther after its third turn than it had after its first turn. \n\n### Rationale:\nThe car started from a point in the tunnel with an initial position, which moved a distance of 5 meters after a turn. Then, after another turn, it moved a distance of 8 meters to a point. Then, after a third turn, the car moved 23 meters farther around the ring. Then, after its third turn, the car then moved 20 meters. Since 23 meters was the total distance around that circle and each of the turns was 8 meters, the distance from the initial point after the 3rd and the 4th turn was 15 meters. Therefore, 23-15=8 and 20-8=12. 12 meters was traveled by the car after its third turn.

{"text": "Nancy's aquarium is filled with 9 cubic feet of water, after the accidental spill. We know this because at first (assuming no aquarium is inside the aquarium) the aquarium held 4 feet long, times 6 feet wide, times 3 feet high, is 54 cubes. Adding 4 feet to this number gives us 58 cubes. Then, the spill took away 54 cubes, and Nancy added 18 cubes (18 cubes = 6 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet = 18 cubes) to the aquarium, making it equal 58 again, then adding in the volume, 168 cubic cubes, plus the volume of the aquarium (4 by 6 by 3 cubes). We got 204 cubes, and then subtract two cubes from 204 we are left with 202 cubes. A cube is 6 inches on each side, adding these numbers together will yield a total of 206 cubes. Next, Nancy filled in the empty space by adding 18 cubes, or 9 cubic feet, and since her aquarium was 4 foot long and 3 cubic feet wide the remainder was 6 feet long and 3 feet wide which is where she added the last 9 cubic feet.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. To start this problem, we must first comprehend the situation presented. Nancy is filling an aquarium to put fish in. She adds water to the aquarium to increase the volume, but her cat knocks over the aquarium, spilling half the water out, so when she came back, she added more water to make it whole.\n2. In order to solve it, we start by breaking down what is known, which is that the aquarium is 6 feet long, 3 feet wide and 3 feet high (4 by 6 feet).\n3. Then, in the first step, we solve for the volumes of the aquarium and the aquarium containing the water and volume we know what is inside and what is outside the aquarium.\n4. Knowing that the aquarium is now filled entirely with water, the volume is now 4 by 6 by.\n5. Next, we add the water spill to solve for the remaining volume. 5", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "The store sold 40 cans. 34 more cans were sold after Jenifer bought that many cans. Mark bought 5 more cans than Jenifer did, so 49 cans were left when Mark is done. Adding 34 to Mark\u2019s count gives 83 cans of milk that Jennifer brought home. (It should be 83 cans - 40 cans Jennifer bought from the store, plus 49+34 cans Mark bought + 40 cans that Jennifer bought)\n\n### Rationale:\nGiven the question: \"If Mark purchased 50 bottles of milk, how many would Jennifer buy after Mark when there were 2, 5 and 3 bottles left after Mark purchased that many bottles?\"\n(Note that Jenifer purchased 40 bottles, and the last five bottles of milk were on the top of the shelf but out of her reach). Now she has 40 cans left (50 minus 10) and 5 bottles left (25 minus ten)\nTo answer the question, you would need to subtract the number of bottles Jenifer bought from the number of cans Mark bought \nMark bought 45 bottles, so you add 6 cans to the 45, which gives you 51 cans of milk.\nYou subtract 51 cans from Jenifer's original bottles of 40 cans, that gives you a total of 29 bottles left over.\n\nNow, since Mark bought 6 cans of milk, Jennifer brought home 6 fewer cans of milk than the number of cans of milk Mark bought\n\nThe question does not mention how many cans of the 40 that Jennifer bought was the last five cans the shop keeper had left, so to avoid confusion and be sure that you know how many cans Jenifer bought at the shop, you would need to know how many cans of that number Jenifer bought were the last five cans\n\nAnswer: 51 + 29 = 80.

{"text": "In 9,500,000 different rooms(option E).\n\n### Proof:\nTo find the total number of rooms, multiply the number of floors by the number of rooms in each floor:\nN = 10 * 10 = 100 rooms\n\nTo find the total rooms when there are no guests, multiply the number of guests by the total number of rooms:\nN = 0 * N = 0 rooms\nThus, when no guests are present there is only 1 room remaining.\n\nNow, to find the remaining rooms after one guest has checked in, subtract 1 from the total remaining number of rooms (or 10999990 rooms).\n\nThe remaining rooms (aka the room the other guest can be checked in) is 1 + 999998*10 = 1,000,009 rooms.\n\nSince this 1000009th room is already checked in, the next room must be in a floor that has been checked in: if not, the 1000,010th room would have to be checked in on a floor that's been checked in already.\n\nBecause there are only 10 rooms in each floor, there must in some way be a connection (or similarity) between each room that's checked in:\n\n1. If the 100,001st room is checked in on a floor where the 100th room is checked in, the 10,000th room (checked in by the 99th guest) must be checked in on the same floor with the guest that checked it in, the room that's checked into is the 100 (10,001) - 1 + (10 * 199) + 1 = 10,198th room\n2. If the 1,099,001st check-in occurs without a similar check-in in the preceding 199,000 checks, that room would force another guest on the 1,001,000th check-in.

The passage suggests that the number of origami stars needed to fill up the glass bottles that Kyle bought is 45.\n\n### Consider the 2 glass bottles\n\nThe passage states that Kyle bought 2 glass that can hold 12 origami stars each. The solution is to add the two numbers that the passage gave above and 12. We get 45. This implies that one of the glass bottles must have a capacity of 45 origami stars.\n\nConsider the following equation:\n\nN=12B*(2B+1)=12*2B*(2B-1)*2B=N-1*(2B)(2B-1)\n\nWe can substitute N=45 and the equation simplifies to\n\nIn order to fill all the glass containers and be able to buy an additional three identical container, Kyle must have a total of 45 stars in the container.\n\n### Rational:2.The passage states that KYLE bought 2 identical glass bottles. We can safely assume that Kyle bought two containers to fit into 45 stars. Each container should represent 22.5 stars. After KYLE had bought the two pairs of identical bottles, Kyle then bought another three identical containers, making it a total of five containers.\n\n##### Rational 2:Consider the 3 containers\n\nThe passage states, \"Kyle bought another 3 container glass bottles.\"\n\nAssume there are 5 pair of identical bottles with a total contain of 45 stars that are bought by Kyle.\n\nThe passage states \"Kyle bought another three identical container glass bottles.\" We can safely assume that each container can now represent 22.67 stars.\n\nWe get the equation:\n\nN-3*(22.67)\n\nN=45\n\nWe know that N must represent 45 origami star and subtracting the value 22.6, We get 22.4.\n\n##### Solution\n\nThe solution of the question is 22.4", "answer": " 75"}

From the answer choices,\n4. Option A: A student above 82 is not considered as average students. The grade points on the average would be above 84. Therefore, the student will be above average.\n5. Option B/C: An average student has a grade over 84. A student with a grade average over 90 is not considered average. So the student will not fit into the category of the previous averages.\n6. Option D: The grade average of more than means the student would have more points when compared with other students. Since a student falls anywhere below 82 as an average student, there is no way for the student to have a grade average over 84.

The question is asking us what the first-year amount was of the 4-year bank deposit. \n3: The first step is to analyze the context and figure out what we really need to consider. For example, we could think about whether there are any hidden assumptions or whether we are only considering the first year, or the first three years, or the first four years, etc.\n4: But in this question, we have everything we need to accurately calculate it. 5: We can look at the sentence and understand that the first-year amount is the only amount we need.

The first year was $95, meaning that she doubled the amount (from $47 the year before) based on the hint \u201cafter 4 years\u201d. The second year was $190, which means she doubled the first yearly deposited amount (from $95). \n7: So, going into the final year, the amount would be 4 times the first year amount. But the final year amount was $450, so the final yearly deposit would be 4 times that, which is $1800.

{"text": "The statement asks is Mr. Montero needs to buy how many gallons of gas more. To answer this question we should analyze this question from two points of views.\nFirst, one can figure out how many gallons does Mr Montero's car have after traveling 600 miles back and forth. According to the given data, 20 gallons for 400 miles and his car has only 8 gallons, means Mr. Montero'stotal 8 gallons minus 400 miles, so Mr Montero's Car should have 8 - 400 is 400 gallons, and also Mr. Monteros car has 8 gallon so he should have 400 - 8 is 392.\nHence, 8 gallons minus (600 - 400) miles, is equals 80 miles.\n\nSecond, one can evaluate the difference of 80 and 400, which is 320 gallons. Meanings is Mr. Montero' car still have (20 gallons of 400).\n\nMr. Montero car total after having 392 gallons should be 8 gallons plus 392 gallon, so 8+392 means Mr. Montero can have 392 plus 8 is =400 gallons in his car, which is a total of 400 gallon. 320 more and 400 less means this.\n\nHence, the answer is 400 more gallons.", "answer": " 52"}

{"text": "Jake has $4,360 left.\n\n### Explain:This can be solved using the principles of proportional reasoning.\n\nTo start, we write the money left so that it starts at $5000 and proceeds the way Jake spent it.\n\nAs we can see, the dollar amount left is first decreased by $2800, then by $2,500. So, it is easiest to note these amounts in reverse, starting with $4,500.\n\nNext, we can use the \"pegging\" rule to move the first two pegs to the left by the number of those pegs. For example, if there are 5 pegs, the first two peg and then the next two pegs are moved 4 pegs to the right.\n\nThis lets us know that the last 3 pegs are unchanged in 3,7, and 3.\n\nNext, it is easy to note each of the pegs decreased by a certain amount. \n```csharp\n     /---5p----------------\n      /\n      /   1   2\n   |  /   3   3\n   3  p\n   3  p \n  \n      1   1   3\n      p\n      4   p\n      \n      3   3   7\n      p\n      5   p \n```\n\nFrom here, the number of pegs left and the decreases can be seen for all three pegs.\n\nWe can see that the first peg has been decreased by one, to $4,506. Then, the number of pennies left is $4,505. This is decreased by a third, to $2,886.\n\nLast but not least, the second peg has been decreases by $200, giving us $4,366.\n\nThis is then a fraction of $4,365. This is because we have 3 pegs left with 4 pennies each, and also another penny. So in total, we have $4,361, and we then subtract one for a total of $4,359 left from $5,000.\n\nTherefore, Jake has $4,", "answer": " 825"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Instructions:How many cups of water does the machine in the basement supply for 5 days?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe following question requires a response that will appropriately answer the question.\n\n## Instructions:\n\nThe device in the understudy can create one liter a day for 5 days. Thus, the full sum of liters produced is 5.\n\n### Response B:\nThe machine can create five liters in less than 72 hours.\n\n### Rationale:\nConsidering the device can create one liter a days for however long it takes, the full sum of liter it has produced is five liters, which doesn\u2019t change over the entire time the device will be running. In any case, as the inquiry expresses it in a time frame of 72 hours, it tends to be figured that the machine can make five liters in three days.\n\n#### Incorrect Responses:\n\nResponse A is incorrect since the machine can\u2019t produce only 2 liters in only 8 hours.\n\nResponse C is incorrect since the sum of liters over the entire time the machine is running doesn\u2019t change.\n\n### Answer:\nResponse 4 is the true response.\n\n### Note:\nThis question and answer will probably be harder than an expected inquiry. This question just depends on the fact that the most extreme speed per hour is 50. A machine normally goes at a fixed speed, so it is not right whether it's in the 10th hour or the first hour. The machine\u2019s speed stays consistent through all hours of the day for a fixed time, but we don\u2019t know how long that will be. The most ideal method for addressing this is to realize it would in a perfect world produce only 5 liters.\n\nIf the machine were to just turn on and off as per conditions, it would create a lot of different results, and if there aren't any circumstances, the last solution will be 5. In addition, if it were to shut off, the machine could have made only 1 liter.\n\nHere's a video by the Cryptoprofessor that discusses this question and the steps needed to answer it.

{"text": "This is not an example of a task for which the request is appropriate.\n\n### Justification:\nWe have seen the following request before:\n\nWhere does this come from? An 18-month advertisement on the cover of the magazine says:\n\n1. A subscription is a promise by a magazine to send you all the issues in the magazine once every two weeks for 18 months, and it is priced at $34, and;\n2. There is a promotion which is running for 18 months and says that the price of the subscription is $0.25 cheaper per issue than the standard one when you are signing up for the \n  18-month subscription, and;\n3. The cost of the magazine during the promotion is $0.24 cheaper per twice-a-month magazine per 18-month period than the cost when you do not take up the promotional offer, and;\n4. You should take up the promotions if you subscribe for 18 months.\n\nThe question is:\nWhat will the total cost of the promotion throughout that 18-month promotional period be?\n\nWe solve the problem by:\n\n1. Determining the total cost of the 18-moth subscription when the promotion is not taken up. This is $548.\n2. Determining the cost difference between the two 18-month subscriptions over the same period and at the same discount. This is $15. This is because if you sign up for 18 months for $34.00 then each magazine costs $34.02, so the total cost is $607.00, which is a difference of $37.24 from $549.76.\n\nWe do not want to do anything with this information because it is irrelevant: 8. Therefore, the total cost of the subscription will be $33.00 for 18 months if you pay for the subscription now and the cost of the subscription will also be $33.24, 18-months from now.\n\nThe request is not correct because it asks for the difference between the two subscriptions which is a nonsense question and gives no information about how many times 25 cents is deducted from the magazine subscription", "answer": " 9"}

You own three rooms\n2. Your parents are coming to visit\n3. You need to choose where to let your parents stay\nNow you are supposed to decide which choices you will allow your parents to stay in based on when and where you are available for them.\n4. When analyzing the choices, note that B, D, E = 3, C is 1, and not 3, so B and D can not be combined.\n5. Thus, you can only allocate rooms 1 and 2 to your parents.\n6. B(2), D(2) = 4, D(1) = 2, then B(3) = 2, D(3) = 3, therefore B(1) D(2) B(2) D(3) = A.\n7. Apt D = the only room not given, so it should be allocated.\n8. However, if your parents do not accept your second choice, they will accept the option they accepted before.\n9. This means when your parents visited last year, they were given room B, and then again B, and then again D, and then again C.\n10. It's a reasonable possibility that your parents prefer D the most, as it's the most distant to them.\n11. Thus, by choosing all options for your parents to stay in, your parents are assured no matter what they choose that they will spend the remainder of the time in a specific room that they previously liked.\n12. In other words, you are providing them the best option.\n13. So we can conclude that the answer is E: Your parents can take all of the rooms.

{"text": "Input:Answer \n\n### Correct Answer: $1.13 per two cards.\n\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. First, we determine how many cards per box the boy bought from each box, we know he bought 6 from each box so 6*3 = 18 cards.\n2. We then determine if the cards were purchased from the first or the second box first: if he initially bought fewer cards from the first box, then he will buy fewer cards from the second box. If he buys fewer in the second box than the first box, then the card total spent will increase. Thus, we determine the total for the first box first:\n   a. First, we determine the total monetary value per card in this box: $1.25*18 cards = 120 dollars.\n   b. Second, we determine the total number of cards from this box: 18 cards. \n   c. Third, we compute the total monetary cost of the cards purchased from this box:  $1.25 x 18 = 220 dollars.\n3. Then we determine how many cards he bought from the second box: in this case, the boy bought 6 cards from each of the first and second boxes, so he bought 3 cards from each box. Thus, he bought 6 in the second box and 6 in the first box, giving us the total number of cards: 18 cards:\n   a. It follows that the total price spent on the cards he bought from the first box was 220 dollars since he bought 3 cards each from each box.\n   b. In order to determine the total price spent on all cards, including the cards bought from the second box, we multiply the box costs by the number of cards purchased from all boxes: $220 X 6 = 1320 dollars since the boy bought 6 from each of the second and first boxes for a total of 12 cards purchased from each box giving a total of 18 cards purchased from each box.\n4.

The following analysis is used to organize the information into steps and simplify the question:\n1. The first thing to understand is that Archie is \"outside playing with his marbles\".\n2. Archie losing 2/3 of his marbles refers to decreasing the quantity by 2/3, which means, that he loses 60%. We can simplify this to 60.\n3. Archie only keeps half of the marbles left. We can rephrase this into a simpler wording as follows: Archie loses the other 80%, or 4/5 of the marbles or 5/6 of them, or 80/6 = 13.33, rounded down to 13.\n4. Considering that Archie has 30 marbles, it can also be said that he has 60 remaining or starting with 30, he decreases the quantity by 20. \n5. Archie keeps 1/2 of the marbles or, we can rephrase this to \"loses the other 50% of remaining ones\". \n6. Considering that Archic currently owns 13 marbles, 5 out of 13, the equation can be simplified to \"remaining ones equals 5/13\".\n\n\nTo conclude, the math question asks for a simple sequence of math equations that includes the following steps.

{"text": "Stu has 9 books and has twice as many books as Albert. Thus, we know Albert has at least one-third of Stu\u2019s books, meaning he has 3 books. This also means that Stu has 9-3=6 books, which is correct!\n\n### Analysis: Firstly, we can easily see that option D is incorrect as we can eliminate any option whose product yields a negative number. Secondly, we can eliminate option A because we can determine the number of books Stu has: since he has 9 books, we know he has 1/2 as many books as Albert, which is 4 \u200bbooks. We can now see that if Albert has 4x as many books as Stu and Stu has just 6 books, then Alberto must have 24 books. As this cannot be true, we can eliminate option B. Now, the answer must lie in options C and E. We can infer that Option C: 24 books is possible because if Albert has a total of 24 books, then Stu may not have 6 books; rather, Stu must have a total of 9-24=15. However, as Stu has 9 books, this is impossible. This can be concluded when considering that Stu must still have at least 6 books to accommodate Albert. Option E then is the correct option, as we know that Stu must have 9 books and Albert must have 24, which means that Stu and Alberto collectively have a combination of 33 books.

{"text": "### Answer:\nMiriam spent a total of 2 hours on the tasks, thus her total time spent was 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Her time spent cleaning her room divided by 2 is 60 minutes.\n\nRationales:\nIt's important to start by analyzing the data given:\n\n30 minutes doing laudry\n15 minutes cleaning bathroom\n**Certain amount of time cleaning room**\n40 minutes doing home work\n\nFrom this, we know that the question concerns the amount of time that Miriam spent on each task individually.\n\nThen, let's eliminate options that contain a similar repetition to an already existing option:\n\n**A: Burn hot** - We know that this isn't a time that can be spent. It's an action or state rather than a time, and therefore we can rule it out.\n\n**B: Eat** - It's the same as \"A: Burn Hot\". \n\nWe're left with **C: Burn 3 hours**. Burning hours is obviously not possible, it can only refer to an action or state. \n\n**D: Gas pump** - A gas pump doesn't specify how long it takes to fill it. \n\n**E: Garbage** - Garbage doesn't refer to a specific amount of time either. \n\nThat leaves us with **E: Bed and breakfast**. This can be interpreted as a certain amount of time spent cleaning her bedroom.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E, it takes certain amount of time to clean Miriam's room.\n\nAnswer: E:\n\nRationales for E:\nThe answer is B, it takes a certain amount of time to do the laundry. Let's analyze the question carefully. We know she spent 30 minutes on laundry. Multiply 30 with 60, hence it would be 1800 minutes and not 15. For doing the laundry she needs one certain number of minutes. Thus, the reason the total time spent is 120 minutes is because she spent a certain amount of time in laundry. So, 120 divided by 2 is exactly 60, hence the answer is B.", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": "She had 55 grams of rice left.\n\n### Rational:\n\nThe solution follows the following logic:\n\n1. We have to make sure that whatever we are doing is relevant and in response to the question asked.\n2. First step is to convert the kg into g.\n3. We know that 1kg is equal to 1000g, so we can multiply 10kg by 1000 and we get 10000g.\n4. Second step is to add the 9/10 kg converted to g. So, we multiply 9/10 by 100 and we get that we have 900 g.\n5. Second step is to subtract the first sum from the second sum we have created. So, we have 1000 g minus 900 g or 100 g.\n6. Third step is to divide the amount of g left by 100 g, which is the value of 0.55g.\n\n### Input\n\n### Response\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. Let's follow the same logic.\n2. 1/4 or 0.25 is a value of g, not kg. So, we have to multiply it by 100 to get its kg equivalent.\n3. So, we have: 0.25 x 100 = = 25.\n4. Now, we have to subtract 25 from 100.\n5. So, 100 - 25 = 75.\n6. Finally, let's divide by 0.55.\n7. So 0.75 / 0.55 = 1.37kg\n\n### Input. She had 1/5 kg of rice left. She cooked 1/6 of the remaining.

{"text": "Let's start by looking at the given information and identifying the relationships among the variables. We know that Tina will sell two books to each customer - she will make a total of 100 books.\n\nNext, we can look at the given information about the cost of each book - $5. We see that the initial cost and the gross profit are constant throughout the question - $20 of profit is made for each book sold, no matter what the total number of books sold.\n\nTo calculate the answer, we can use the formula: profit = sales revenue - cost where profit is calculated on the number of books sold (as opposed to individual customers). If profit were to be calculated per customer instead of per book sold, our formula would need to be: profit = {revenue - cost} per customer.\n\nThe total sales revenue is represented in the question as: $20 * 100, or $2000. The total cost for 100 books is $5 * 100 = $500. So the profit for this initial calculation, according to the formula given above, will be: profit = $2000 - $500 = $1500.\n\nLet's try and answer this question using the information that we know. Since, initially, Tina sells 2 books to each customer, each book would have to sell for $10. So if you multiply $2000 by 100, you would get $200,000. And if you subtract $500 from that value you get $200000 - $1500 = $97700. \n\nThen let's consider the relationship between the number of books and the number of customers, according to the problem. We see that she makes a profit of $20 per book sold and the number of books sold is equal to the number of customers. However, each book is sold to two people, making the number of customers equal to double the number of books sold. \n\nBased on the relationship between the number customers, number of books sold and the cost of producing a book, we can conclude that the answer is D: 48, because the profit is made on the number of books or number of customers - and those are the values that must be doubled, as stated earlier", "answer": " 4"}

So, I had 42 pencils and 42 pens. \n\n### Rationales:1. The word \"pen\" denotes a writing instrument that uses an inkless tube, containing a metal nib, to create a mark on paper or other surfaces.\n2. The term \"pencil\" indicates a slim object with a wooden stalk and an encircling piece of graphite or lead at one end, typically used for drawing or writing on paper.\n3. The sentence describes Catherine having 'an equal number of pencil', thus the options B, E, and I don't make sense because we know she has an equal number of pancil and pens. Therefore, we can eliminate them.\n4. Option C says \"I gave a set of pencils to each one of my seven friends. \" This means Catherine is simply giving out pencils to her friends. So, she didn't give anything to herself while giving something out. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n5. Option D says \" I gave a set of pens to each one of my three friends. \" Here, we know she has already gave away 60 pens, and she had 60 again, she is not giving anything to herself now.

So,3 years ago from now, her age is 3.\nStep 4A:In 5 years, after 3 years (3 years ago), her age now is 8-(3), so her age will be.\nStep 5:Then, we can see that 9 is the closest to 8-3=5.\n\n### Input2:The answer is $3$ because $3*3*3*3 = 81, and 81$\\checkmark$, because 3*3*3 means 3 cubed.

Choices:  a: To preserve momentum\n\n### Demo Response:  This has to do with conserving momentum, specifically the conservation of angular momentum, a physical quantity that represents how a body moves.\n\n### Demo Answers:\n1. The initial momentum is the product of the mass (m) of the bicycle and the velocity (v) on the left wheel, while after the turn, the new momentum is the product of this velocity (v) on a front wheel and a mass (m) at this speed. This conservation principle implies the left wheels speed has to be conserved evenly with the right wheel, thus turning at the same speed; this is why the left wheel has to turn left.\n\n### Input : A person can go twice as far on one tank of gas than they can on two tanks.

Now, we want to find the total amount of dollars for 5 dozen golf balls, 2 dozen golf balls, and 48 golf balls individually.\n* To answer this, I have figured out that 20 golf balls are equivalent to 10 dollars and that 2 dozen golf balls is equivalent to $20. So to find the total amount, I have multiplied 20 golf balls, by 5, which has resulted into $100, which means 20 golf balls = 10 dollars, but 5 dozen are 50 golf balls, then I figured out that 2 * 50 = 100. Now I can simply add 48 golf balls = 48 and 2 * 5 = 10 golf balls.

{"text": "The answer is 52:\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: How long do animals live on Mars? Choices:  C: many years D: decades \nRationales: First, you should note that the question is asking about the amount of time it takes for animals to live on Mars. It does not specify whether it refers to a specific type of animal, which means that we need to consider the places where animals might live in general.\nSecondly, let's eliminate all the options aside from the ones that are associated with animals.\nThirdly, it can be concluded from the options that there is no specific time frame associated with the term \"many years\", since this term can also be used when describing the amount of time that you spend with someone in a relationship, or for certain tasks.\nFourthly, in contrast to the term \"many years\" that does not have any specific time frame, the term that's associated with \"decades\" implies that these animals could live for a certain period of time - which is often considered to be over 10 or 20 years.\nHowever, as there are several animal species that live much longer than those periods that's why the right answer is 'D: decades' is the right one.\n\nInput: What is a lighthouse?

Next, we can eliminate the answers that don't refer to anything - like 'A: structure' since this doesn't tell us information about the specific type of structure, so we can cross it out.\nThen, we can eliminate the incorrect answers too as they do not match the definitions of the correct answers - like E: light. 'Light in general' can make us think about lights that are located in different places and can even refer to the flashes of lightning, whereas here we need something specific. However, the correct answer is G: signal, as this will be a signal that is made to warn ships in different places. Therefore, it will most likely be related to the flashes of the flashlights which can be used", "answer": " 46"}

{"text": "The area of the 400 feet parking lot is 4,000 feet.  80 of that area is the total area to park a car, 80% is 120.  120 multiplied by 10 is 1,200 square feet. To find the number of cars we multiply 1,20 to 100 for 1,20,000 cars.\n\n\n### Input.\nWe have a square with sides of height 5. It is rotated 90 degrees. One side is 10 times more than the other side. \nWhat is the ratio of the sides of the squares?\n\n### Rationale\nThis question is solved by first constructing a formula of a square that will act as a tool for solving this riddle. Here it is:\n$$S = r \\times S$$\n\nWe are given that one side of the square is 10 times the other, we will use this knowledge to solve. \n$$S = (r_{1} + r_{2}) \\times S$$\nWe are given that the two sides are length 5. So this equation becomes\n$$1.5 \\times S$$\nRounding to a number that is 10 times this, is 15 square. This is the answer.\n\n### Input\nIn a 80 by 80 square inch rug, it costs about $500 dollars. How much does it cost per square inch?\n\n### Solution: \nThis question is solved like it is one of those geometry proofs. By converting the number of square inches ($80 \\times 80$ or $6,400 square inches) divided by the total price ($500.00) gives us the answer of ~0.0825 dollars per square inch. \n\n\n### Rationales\nHow to Solve this Question:\nThis question is answered by first turning the question into units of currency, which is $0.50 (half of the first digit in the price) per square inch. From there, multiply the number of inch we had, which was 6400, by the unit we had which was $0.08. From there, we get 512 which is the answer.", "answer": " 16000"}

{"text": "Michelangelo will have three weeks to paint the remaining 14 ceilings.\n### Rationale:  1.We can use elimination to eliminate the impossible situations and focus on the rest of the task.\n2. The options A, B, C, and D can be eliminated because the task says that Michelangelo is painting 28 ceiligs in total. There can never be a negative number of ceiligs to paint.\n3. Also, the options C and D cannot be an answer because in C, Michelangelo would not be able to paint one ceiling in one week\n4.The answer can be E because Michelangelo will have 14 ceiligs to paint in three weeks.\nAnswer: D\n\n### Input The painter says he can only paint what? Choices: A: defective things E: perfect products B: people with flaws C: damaged D objects\nRationales:Step 1: The question asks us what the painter can only paint. Here, if we consider the painter's statement to be true, it means that he can't paint perfect products.\nStep 2: We must therefore eliminate D objects as an answer.\nStep 3: We can also eliminate objects B. They are the things on which the painter can easily apply his skills and are therefore not good fit for this question.\nStep 4: We can eliminate choice E because the painter is not painting perfect products, and so, the ones he paints have flaws.\nStep 5: All this brings us to this: options C and A can be the correct answer, while the others must be eliminated.\nStep 6: Since we cannot pick C (damaged people), the option left is A. Therefore, the answer here is A: people with flaws and not a perfect product.\nAnswer: A\n\n###Input: What is being compared?

By solving, we can ensure that 10 is subtracted so this works out to be an average.\n\n### Incorrect: B: 7.9\n\nThe solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the initial 10 songs that are known, thus we do not know the true average. \n\n### Correct: A: 6.2\n\n### Input:\"Who is he?\" I said \"His name is ___ \". -------. \"Oh!

It is about two people talking about a person whose physical appearance they know very well. By observing how they speak about that person it is possible to understand that they are not describing the same features. That is why the answer must be 'd': ___'.  \n2. One talks (or says) about 'he' with some positive features, on the other hand, the other refers that 'that person' does not have any positive features. Thus, the answer must be ugly. \n3. The options are: A: tall. B: short. C: heavy. D: thin. E: beautiful. F: ugly.\n4. The first three options are related to physical features that are not used by neither person. Only option E: beautiful is used by both but it is not necessary for describing the person, so is discarded.\n5. So the answer would be F=ugly\n\n### In incorrect: B: short\n\nThis choice seems to be relevant because one of the people in the conversation is describing a person as being tall. For this reason, the person might consider the person is short or maybe less tall.

{"text": "The four children find 50 ants together, which is the equivalent of what Abe found.\n\n### Rationale:\nInput:The question is to calculate how many ants the four children find together after combining what they each found.\n\nOption A:\n1. Let\u2019s use the 4 children as 4 people, one being Abe, one being Beth, one being Celeste, and one being Duke.\n2. The first child, Abe, found 4 Abe\n3. The second child, Beth, saw twice as many ants, thus Beth found 10 Beth\n4. CeCe found twice as many of what Abe found and Beth found, thus CeCe finds 2 Beth\n5. Finally, Duke discovered half as many ants, so Duke found half of what the other 3 found, Duke found 0.5 CeCe\n6. This means that together, the 4 children found 4 + 10 + 2 + 0.5 = 17 \n7.

We\u2019ll be able to eliminate some options based on their properties. \n\nOption A: This states that even numbers are the multiple of four. But even numbers with the same odd multiple are the even result of the multiple, meaning that even numbers will always be even and the last two digits will only be divisible by two and won\u2019t be a multiple of three.\nOption C: This states that even or odd ends in either a 0 or a 2. But the last two digits can be a multiple of three, so at least one of the options has at this, so this doesn\u2019t mean the last two digits will always have a 2 in it. \nOption B: This states that last two digits being even are the same number as even multiple of three.

{"text": "The answer is 25 years.\n\n### Justify the Response:\n1.  In the second and third equation, we can subtract 4 from the first term in each equation, leaving us with terms of only 3 years. Then we can subtract 3 year of the dog, leaving us with 1.5 years of a dog. This will give us an equation with only 1.5 years on the first side and years of the fish on the second side. This will give us the equation 5.5 + 2.5 = 1.5 to solve. This will give us 5.125 as the answer, which we can then change to years to get 5 years. Thus we can say \"On average, dogs live 3.25 more years than hamsters live. And hammers live 1.25 average hamster lives. How many hamster do they live together?\"\n2. When you first set up the problem, there should be two variables: Fish and Dog. So in the first step, there should be a variable Fish.\n3. In the third step, the equations do not make any sense. They also should not be subtracting like that. There should be an AND and OR in the second and third equations for the first and second variables. This is the main problem with the logic here. It could have been solved differently than the suggested way through the instructions.\n4. The problem can be solved through subtracting 2.5, giving us an equation of: fish + dog - 2.5 = hamster + dog - 2 and adding 2 to the second equation. Subtracting the 2.5 from Fish + dog (which is 5 years) and then subtracting from the hamster (2 years) will give us 5 + dog - 6.5 - hamster + dog - (2) and then solving for Fish will give it a value of 1.75. Then, you should move everything else over to Dog and then simplify by adding 2.5 to the hamster, giving you an answer of 17.5.\n5.

When arriving, the angle between the 2 streets is what? Choices: A: 35 degrees C: 38.2 degrees D: 90 degrees E: 45 degrees\nRationales: In this question, the students meet on the way to the lecture, there is no additional information about the locations of the two students prior to the meeting.\nIf we use the term \"meet at the intersection,\" we already understand that the two streets intersect at exactly one vertex.\nWe know the angle between the two streets equals the angle of intersection. \nTherefore, the only relevant information is the length of the two intersecting streets. \n\nLet A and B be the angles of the streets.\nTherefore, we have the given values:\n1. The angle of intersection A = angle between the intersections B\n2. The hypotenuse AB = the length of the street from street 4 to the joint\n3. The base b = a street length (street 1 to 4)\n4. a^2 + b^2 = c\na^2 + b^^2 = AB^2\n5. The base a (street 1 to intersection) = AB sin ((A + B)/2)\n6.

Choices:  A - ready B - willing C - able D - capable\nRationales:\n1. The sentence states, \"After having the procedure successfully demonstrated\", it is clear that the patient in question has received (or had) some kind of instruction or demonstration on the procedure.\n2. Now, we need to determine what kind of result the demonstration or instruction has on the patient.\n3. Options 'a', 'b' and 'c' all focus on describing the situation after receiving the information or demonstration, while 'd' is the only choice that focuses on the patient's ability and competence to carry out the procedure.\n4. Option 'd' is the most relevant as the sentence already hints that the patient has had the procedure already and 'd' also contains the terms 'able' and 'capable', which directly align with the question.\n5. Lastly, the use of the word'successfully' in the sentence suggests that the procedure went smoothly, so the correct phrase 'able to carry out the procedure' is suitable for this question.\n6. Therefore, the answer for the question is 'd'.\n\n# Chapter 5: Questions with Missing Information Questions\n\n## Input:You had a very interesting work lunch.

{"text": "The correct answer would be 875.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nFirst, we need to eliminate the invalid options and reduce the number of options to choose from.\n\nThere is no desk with 32 desks. If there was a desk with 31 desks and one student was to use it, then it would mean that there are more students than desks. Therefore, we can eliminate one-third, three-fourth, and half.\n\nIn addition, we see that every desk has one student. If the number of available desks was a number divisible by five, then the number of students would also be a number divisible by 5. However, this is not the case with the number of available desk. The number of available desk is the prime number 7, so all of the available desk cannot be divided equally among the students, therefore all we need is a number divisible by the smaller prime number 3 (exactly two students would use the last desk).\n\nThat leaves us with six options, and they are; 28/3, 115/3, 250, 750/3 and 1500/3.\n\nThe answer in the first three ones is easy to figure out and is therefore eliminated. Then from the remaining two we need to think where the fraction is in the division form, and then what that means. If the fraction is in the second place: a number/3 then that number would have to be divisible by 5 so we can deduce that that number has to have a remainder of 5, which makes no sense, but if the fraction is in the third place: a number/15 then the number would have to be a number divisible 21 (5+5+5+5) so with that we get 750/15. The last two options would make a sum of 873 or 874, both of which are invalid. That makes the answer 875; the only answer that is greater than 874 but less or equal to 875\n\nAnswer: 875", "answer": " 400"}

We can use a calculator and get the answer 53.2795 or use mental strategies. It is common to convert decimal values to a fraction the denominator of which is 100. That's 55.65/100 or a conversion factor of 0.5565/10. We want 1% (0.01) of the quantity in the numerator. Thus, we want 0.01 (1/100) times the quantity in the numerators as the quantity in the numeratorials of the product.

{"text": "There are five cows as a result.\n\n### Reason: This reasoning is inadequate because the equation is missing two essential components. The first is the calculation of the cows per week at the beginning. The second is the calculation of milk produced per cow per week, or the milk produced by each cow in the total calculation of milk.\n\n### Output: The cows produce a total of 1,672 liters of milk per year, hence one cow produces 0.84 liters of milk per day.\n\n### Input1: On a farm, on average, every 6 cows produces 108 litres of milk per week.

{"text": "Eleven\n\n### Rationale: We can start by evaluating the choices provided. Option E: \"11\" makes sense because it's the last choice and is most specific in describing the singers in the third verse and the final verse of the song.\n\nWe then need to determine the correct formula for calculating the number of people in the third verse, so that we can substitute the equation into the first and second verses by making use of addition and subtraction.\nThe formula of half of the total - third of the remaining - whole, when applied with the first verse's numbers suggests: (half of 30) + ((third of 20) - whole) = (15 + 6/3) = 9\n\nIt is safe to say that only half of the remaining singers in the first verse participated in the second verse, hence 20 and 15 are the correct first and second verse numbers\n\nSubstituting these into the formula results in: 0 + (1/3 of 5) = 1/3 of 15 \n\nFor the second formula, where a quarter of the remaining singers are to join then it becomes 0 + ((1/4 of 5) - whole) = 1/4 of 15 = 3.\n\nFortunately, adding the 9 and 3 gives us 12 as the final number of singers.\n\nFinally considering the 30 singers in the first and final verse, the 12 singers from the second verse and 11 singers from the fourth verse, we see that there are 54 people in total.\n\nHowever, the choir is composed of 35 people.

{"text": "100\n\n##### Explanation:\nVampires breed every night and turn 5 people into vampires, so after two vampires are brought into town there are now 15 vampires on the third night. 15 * 2 = 30.

However, the next day there are now 68 vampires because the 62 turn into vampires and 6 new people have become vampires, so this number increases to 66 by the seventh night. Because there is no way to fit more than 66 vampires on the eighth night (66 * 2), there are now 128 vampires in Willowton.

You are to answer every question by choosing which statement would correctly complete the original statement.\n\n### Example\n\n### Insttuion:The question asks for the name of the person who was previously married to the current holder of the 1st Baron of Dulverton.\n\n### Rationale:First, we look at the definition of a Baron, as it is used to describe the title of a noble in the peerage of the United Kingdom. Then, we analyze the sentence's structure and look for clues that can help us understand the meaning of the statements in the sentence.\n\n### First choice:If we take the first option, we can see that it refers to a woman named Lady Dulverton. However, if we take into account the original statement describing the current holder's spouse, it would be clear that it should refer to the man who was married to that person, and not a woman. We can reject this option.\n\n### Second choice:Now lets look at the second option to see how it fits the logic of the sentence. If we examine the original statement's second part, we recognize that it begins with the phrase \"who has been previously married to the...\" and then states the name of the man who is currently holding the Baron title. This means that option 2 describes the man who was previously married to this person prior to him being appointed to his current position. Option 2 is therefore the correct answer.\n\n### Correct Answer:Option 2\n\n### Instractions:\nThe question asks for a logical statement that would follow the statement \"Those who have not been vaccinated do not need to.\" in a logical manner.\n\nThe following word list is for reference: the word \"should\" used to express a personal opinion, the phrase \"do not\" is commonly used to negate an affirmative statement, the words \"those who\" are used to refer to a collective group, and the word \"vaccination\" is a type of medical procedure.\n\n### 1st choice:The correct choice would be: People who should not get vaccinated, often those with allergies or imm", "answer": " 14"}

We have now obtained 10.5 days. \nThen we can multiply 10.5 by $10 to obtain $105. We now add the two numbers, 105 and $10.5 to give us $115.50, then divide by 2 to obtain $57.75 and then move the decimal place and round until $50.00 to give us a weekly salary of $5000.\nRationales: We can assume that Ludwig works 4 days a day and not the full 7 days that are stated in the question. If we subtract 7 from 4 then take away half a day to do the other two days. We can then take away 7 from 3, half of what Ludwig works in each week, to find the number of days he actually works. We can then multiply that by the salary and work out how much Ludwig should earn on a weekly basis.\nAnswer: $500.00\n\n## See also\n\n* Cognitive processes\n* Cognitive function\n* Cognitive neuroscience\n* Cognitive model of reality\n* Cognitions that cause addiction to gambling\n* Declarative memory\n* Evaluative judgment\n* Higher-level thinking\n* High-level skill\n* Learning theory\n* Low-level process\n* Problem solving\n* Reflective process\n* Self-awareness\n* Spatial cognition\n\n### Related to children or adolescents\n\n* Developmental psychology\n* Epigenesis\n* Piaget's theory of cognitive development\n* Theory of Jean Piaget\n* Vygotsky's sociocultural theory\n\n### Relative to specific topics\n\n* Affective reasoning\n* Attention\n* Cognitive styles\n* Computational model of cognition\n* Discursive reason\n*", "answer": " 55"}

Now let's isolate the factor B, i.e. quantity demanded by changing the equation from D(Q) = S + QB to D(Q) = D(Q)\nStep 5: Putting this to the question at hand:  D(Q1) = BQ1 + D(Q1)\nStep 6: Rearranging, we get D(Q1)  = B/ [D(Q1)] Since this is given in the question, we set equal to D(Q1) from the equation above.

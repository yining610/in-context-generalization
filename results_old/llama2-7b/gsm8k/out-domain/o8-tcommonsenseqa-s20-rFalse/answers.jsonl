The first one I choose does not change when you change the second item in the perm. This is why there are (3^r)! ways you can do it like the permutation (1,2,3). So that's one, because there's only one way to do it (permit. 1,2,3)\nThese (3^r)! are the first thing in our formula. n - r! are what they choose after that.

{"text": "The cost of the ice cream totalled more than the $4 he spent on the frozen yoghurts. The answer to how much more would be $56.\n\nInput:Johnny had a penny and two dimes and seven quarters. He paid eight dollars using his money. Did he have any money left over?\n\n### Solution:He had no money remaining.\n### Instruction Description:\nThis is a multi-choice math equation. Choose the best option.\n### Solution Description:\nThis is an addition problem in the context of 7 quarters. The equation would start by first adding the two quarters using the quarter factored at 2. Then adding the penny to this answer in its decimal equivalent. Then adding the dime to the penny which gives us the answer the the problem.\n\n### Input\nI have 4 pink and 4 blue socks. I put them in a pile, and each one is picked out at random. What is the probability that each sock gets picked?\n\n### Solution\nThe formula to compute the probability P(getting 1 specific item) is P(getting 1 item) = 1/Total\nFor this specific example, we can get 1/2 as the total of getting a blue or pink. This means there is 1/2 chance of getting a blue or getting a pink. If we are going to multiply probabilities, we have to be careful to multiply both sides by the Total that the first probability is divided by, which in this case is 1/2. \nFor the 4 pink and blue socks in the scenario, the formula will reduce to 0.5 times 0.5, which is 0.25, which is equal to 25%.\n\nInput:If a person has two jobs, each with the same pay rate, the rate is how much more money will they earn per hour than if they only had one job?\n\n### Answer: If a person has two jobs and each job pays the same, at the same hourly rate, the rate is twice the rate of one job. If someone has a job earning $14.00 per hour, their rate of hourly pay is $7.00 per hour.\n\n### Example\nInput:How much more money will the person earn", "answer": " 36"}

Also, we changed \"age 65 or older\" to \"age 55 to 64\". Our solution is a pattern replacement approach (see below) as shown in the output string of this example. The basic task is a bit tricky: the first thing we should notice is the variable for age, since the ages in the given text are not the same as those found in the given text.\n\nTo replace all instances of \"the only way to treat\" we would need to determine which of the cases needed to be replaced and which do not based on where one of the text strings is contained within the other. If the replacement is in one of the paragraphs, then we would need to look at the other instance, and determine whether the replacement string exists somewhere there.\n\nThe first technique would be to try to recognize where \"The only way to detect, or treat, blah blah blah, is to\" exists in the given input.

It seemed like the problem, not just the question was taking time. But, I'm not sure if anyone was interested in the question without the answer to see if they got the right answer on their own. I thought the answer to the question without the answer would be like a math game.\n\n### Solution: The second woman leaves at the earliest time, 9:05. The math is in the problem's answer. There is a problem with the 20 seconds the first woman arrives being off after the walk time has been subtracted 15 blocks. I made the math calculation based on the problem. I'm not sure how those minutes and seconds came to my mind. I just did it.\n\n### Output:\n\n### Task 1\n\nHow many extra gallons must bring before they can reach destination.\n30 extra gallons are needed.\n\n### Task2\n\nThe second woman leaves at the early time.\n\n### Demo Response\n\nThe second woman, who leaves 10 minutes later, leaves at the latest time.  9:25.\n\n### The demo response from the learner\n\n9:25\n\n### Output 1\n\nHow can you use the information below to determine what is the height of a ladder?\n\nSay each rung of a ladder is 1 foot long.

{"text": "196 Residents\n\n### Solution:\nFirst, we calculate the amount of floors that there are that have 6 apartments.\n\nIn 5 apartments, multiply 2 because we got from the question that half of the floors have that many apartments so divide that by 2. The answer 2 is 6 apartments. In 5 apartments multiply 5, 6, 6, 5, and 6. The answer will be 6. So adding those 2: 8. That's how many floor has 6 apartments. Now for the floor that has 5 apartments: multiply 5 and then 6. The answer is 30.\n\nSo add all the floors with 6 apartments 8+8=16. Now add all the floors that have 5 apartments 14+30=44. But that's just half because we said the other half has 5 apartments. So 44+22=66.

{"text": "The amount of sales, both credit and cash, divided by the amount of credit sales, is half. The result is 1/4 times 80/2 multiplied by.5 is 16 cash sales that are worth $80.\n\n### Input\n\nThe buyers who came yesterday bought goods worth $1,200. If 25% of the total amount of purchases Mr. Jones made yesterday were credit sales and the rest were cable sales, how much did he get for cash sales?\nAnnie, 5/19/98\n### Response:\n\nMr. Jones made $400 worth of cash sales because that is just 1/4th of 8,500. The number of sales is in the denominator in this proportion.\n\n**The amount of purchases he made, both credit and cable sales, is 4/5th of the whole. To get this problem solved, we need to find how much he made for purchases.**\n\n1200/4/5 is 8500, the whole of his purchases\n\nSo you plug everything into the equation.\n\nMr. Jones's cash sales are.25 of $400, or 20 cash sales.\n\n### Author's Analysis:\nThese problems are pretty straightforward.

{"text": "After giving Oomyapeck 4 of the eyes, he will have eaten 22 of the eyes.  Now, he and Ittymangnak have each eaten 19 fish.\n\n### Input \n[Teachers may find this input is more difficult to read due to the unusual format.] \n\nYou should have no trouble with this question, but we want to be sure.  If you did not have any trouble with this question, then you may finish working on Practice: Grades and Grade Distributions Level 1.  If you did have trouble with this question, read on.\n\n\n### Demystifying what exactly the question is asking\n\n\nThe question is asking, how much of a fish is left to each person? \n\nThe answer to this question is in the question.  Because you are given the information about how many fish will be given to the adults, just subtract how many fish are being given to the dog.  Divide this number by three fish and you will get the answer.  You can see this working with this equation. (Note: the following equation shows how this problem is solved, and should not be confused with the problem itself.)\n\n\nAda: 20\nBim: 20  \nChim: 20\nAda gets 8, Bim gets 8, and Chim gets 8.\n\n### Revisiting the answer\n\n\nWe start off knowing that Ittymangnrak catches 60 fish in one day.  He gives 4 fish to Oomyapeck, who gives two to his dog. There are 56 fish left.  Now, both the father and mother each ate 19 of the 56 fish.  This means that Ittymangnrnak ends up with nine fish, and her mother ends up with 40.  How many remaining fish are there after they have split the 56 fish?  Answer: 3.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn solving this problem you were asked to answer a few basic addition and subtraction problems.  You used a few basic equation rules to simplify the equation.  You would have needed to know how many eyes Oomyapeck was eating and how to split one group of fish and fish that the dog was taking among the rest.", "answer": " 4"}

The statement says that, in a year Mark uses \u00bd his allotment of sick days and \u00bd his allotments for vacation days). Mark only uses \u00bd his allotted sick days and leaves the other \u00bd, then it follows that he is using 5 days or so of vacation day for sick days as well so leaving him with the vacation days he was allowed.  The 8 hour long workday is a standard thing so he would use that as basis.  He would not use a sick day in full as he is at work, so he might have 2 half days and 1 full day or whatever. For vacation days, he could get 4 half days and 2 full days etc.  It says one sick day and 1 vacation day.  He could, for example, have 2 sick days (one per day) and 3 vacation days (3/5) so 1 day of sickness per person that is 3 2-hour days for these people, 2 for one person per day and an 8th person that only uses 2/3 days.

The question asks for the price of 7 pounds machine. That means we now need to do the following equation.\nThe 7 pound machine has 7 lb -  16 lb =  9 lb to add to the 4 lb machine. We can simplify that out of 12 lb + 9 lb = 1=15 lb difference. That means the 8 lb machine costs $16 plus $15 = $31 while the 7 lb machine costs $31 + $15 = $46 making that the 4 lb machine costs $4.60 for 12 lb.\nThat means the 7 lb machine should cost 31.00 - 2 x 5 pounds = 24.25\n\n### Second Step: After determining the total difference we now need to find out how many pounds above the 3 pound is the other machine.

{"text": "This was a really good question that involved lots of math!  First, we had to calculate the number of loads Hayes did in one week.  It helped that it was mentioned that the pods come in packs of 39 which makes our answer just the number of 'packs', or 39, divided by the number of days in a week, 7.  That left us with an answer of 5 packs of detergents.  \n\nNext, we had to figure out how many years Hayes will be doing laundry.  We have the equation '39 divided by 7' so we just had to divide both sides by 39 which gives us the number of days Hayes does laundry in a year.  In other words, he does the laundry every 31 days.  \n\nFinally, we had to figure how many packs of ditergent pods he needs in a year, so we multiply the number of days he does laundry by the number of packs.  This leaves us with our final answer of 1.7 packs.  \n\n### Input:(1953-1973) is the golden age of what?\n\n### Demostration:(773) is the age.

{"text": "The amount of flour in the pantry is $x$ which we can assume is not going to be consumed, and 200g in the cupboard which contains $y$ loaves. \n\nThe value for $y$ must be greater than or equal to the number of loaves you can make while leaving some flour in reserve.  As a simple formula for baking bread: $y = 200/x$.\n\nSo we know $x + y = 200$ and you also need to reserve $100$ for the other loaves.  So we want to divide $100 = y - x$, so $y = x - 100$.\n\nUsing the above: $200 = x + (x-100)$ We can then substitute $y = x-100$ into the equation and get $100 = 300 - (x-10).  So just simplify 100 to get x = 10 x 10 to get x =100 and y = 100 - x = 90.\nTherefore you can make two loaves of bread while also having $100$ g of flour in reserve.", "answer": " 2"}

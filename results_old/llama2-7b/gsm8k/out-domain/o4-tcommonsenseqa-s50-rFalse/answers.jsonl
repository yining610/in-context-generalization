The washing machine saves 15% energy, so the cost in Japan is 85% of the cost in the USA. The sheets take 55 minutes and cost 85% of $76, which is $68. Therefore the sheets take 55 x $68/.85, which is 70.6 minutes.

So\n4. 24 + 40 = L, the number of square feet that Joel can use for strawberies.\n5. Or you can just apply simple proportions. 1/4 of 16 squre feet is 25 percent, so 4/16 times 64 is 25 percent of 64, so 20.\n6. You can also apply proportions to the fruit section itself. 1/4 * 16 = 12.8 percent is approximately 1/4 or \u00bc of 16, so 12.8% * 12.8368 = 24 is approximately \u00bc or 25 percent. So, 64 * 12.4 percent = 24, or 24 is \u00bc of 64.\n7. Or\n8. You can subtract 20, which is the number of square feet for the fruit section from 64, which equals 14.\n9.

{"text": "The formula for calculating the amount of tennis balls Ralph did not hit is the amount he hit multiplied by two, then add one. The formula does not change from when Ralph did 2/5 of the balls he hit, and it does not change from the moment he hit 1/3rd of the remaining balls (75).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe formula for getting \"the amount of tennis ball Ralph not hit\" is 2x of the 2/5 times he hit the first 10 (since he hit 2/5 times of 175) plus 1.\n\nThen the formula is 3x of the 1/3rd time the remaining 75 that he hit, so 3x(1/3rd 75) = 22.5\n\nSo the answer would be, 22.5.\n\n### Rubric\n\n| Criterion   | Level Explanation\n| ---------   | -----------------------------------------------\n| Usage and spelling | The wording is clear and organized.

We then subtract the number of wine the person took from the x given(1-10=2)to get 10 as the possible remainder since we already have 5 more people who took soda(2).\n\nAnd therefore, the final outcome is 10 people.\n\nThere were 28 people who took 28 different drinks. 18 took wine,15 took soda, 10 took beer, and 5 of them only took wine. How many different kinds of people were at the gathering, excluding those in the penalty box \n\nGiven the number who only took wine(5) and we already counted 18 who took wine so 18 + 5 = 23.So there will be 23 people in total.\n\nHow many people attended a gathering? The number of guests, their drinks (other than alcohol), and their tote bags (excluding those belonging to staff):\n\nGiven the total of wine(20),soda(16)and beer(7), we can use a modulo to get the number of guests who take wine and soda that is (16-20) = -4. And we have less people who drink soda since it was already taken from the total, so -4+16 = 12. And for beer, we will also subtract the already taken(7) so 7-7=0 or beer is also evenly taken.\n\nTherefore, we have a total of 12 people and then the number of guest minus the  staff= 12.", "answer": " 31"}

This is necessary because blue and yellow shoes are being sold. Since we only have an approximate value of yellow shoes and half of them were sold it means we only have 28 shoes worth of that color. Also 5 blue shoes were sold which is also an approximate value.

One option for you is to select two choice as the numerator and three choice as the denominator. Doing it this way would result in a fractional answer.\n\nThe next approach is to decide which statement has the greater value.\n\n**For Example 1:**\nSometimes the denominator is greater than numerator and vice versa. In the case above, the numerator is greater. So the numerator is 280.17 and denominator is 900. This results in the answer being $0.30.\n\n### Solution\nIn answer for the first one, the instructions say to pick three numbers. I picked 2,4,6,9,12,15. I put together two and four making six. I put together 9 and 12 making 21. Put together 6,9,15 making 20 plus 21 plus 280.

We will see that this is not enough to buy all the chicken that she desires. Join needs $30 more to buy chicken. Let's try and get Joan to spend her budgeted $60 in total.\n\nJoan needs to spend $20 on chicken, $10 on bacon, and she knows she is going to spend $5 on each container of hummus.

Now she has $11 left.\n\nNow all that is left is $11 to spend on vegetables, which are $10.\n\nIf Joan decides to go to one more stop at the grocery story before going to the cashier, perhaps she can make sure she does not go over budget.\n\nJoan is going with $11 left to spend on the next item that she wishes to buy.

Joan now has to buy two containers of hummus. She spent $11 on groceries, except for hummus. If she had spent $15 on hummus, she would have spent a total of $26, over her $25 budget.\n\n\n\n**Note**: You may not copy or download any image of any kind from GoogleDrive without my explicit written permission.", "answer": " 5"}

This is the year 2020 and will be used to tell us how much is spent in each year.\n\nI next write the words \"on defense.\" This means that it is money the USA spends to keep its military strong.\n\nI then type B: 20: this means that i am specifying the year 20. 2020 is the year that the data pertains to.\n\nI use the : symbol to seperate the 0's.\n\nThe question was 686 BILLIONS.\nThis indicates that there is one 6 before the last two 0's. I write this the same way the question was by typing 686 which is 686 BLL.\n\nI then write BILLION like the question stated and write the letter i which indicates the 1st number of the billions which is going to be 0. (1 BILL. which is 1000's)\n\nI repeat this process until there are zero 0's. The zero 0's get written in after the : symbol is used.\n\nBecause the first number in the billions is 1, i write the first 0 and i.\n\nNext, we work out the billions,  i+0=1.  The second number of the billions i.e, billions is two.  I type i2=4.\n\nThe only number left that is a billions is three, so i type i3 which is 9.\n\nFinally I say, we now have 64.\n\nThus, after the i are finished, there will be left 46 for the MILLION.\n\nI write a 4 after the 6 and then i write 2.\n\nNext i write i2=4, i3=9. and i4=25.\n\nAfter i", "answer": " 136"}

{"text": "Jack needs to sell 11 cookies to reach his goal.\n### Solution: First, the total number of brownies sold is given as 4. Now, that 4 brownies was sold for 12 dollars ($3 \u00d7 4), so if 4 brownies were sold for 1 dollar and each cookie was priced differently, that would make sense.\n\n### Next, the total number of lemon squares that were sold is 5. So if that was $4, it would follow that a different price was given to the other. A lemon square was sold for $2, so the 11 cookies sold for $40 and 1 dollar were sold for 4 brownies, which is 1/3 dollar that's why 4 $3 brownies were sold for $13 was bought for $80, so Jack needs to sell 5 cookies to come to his goal.\n\n### Input The sum of six and 50 equals 56.

For this task, we assign the 0th element an answer of 0 when it's the first item in the file.\n\nWe use `i=0` to specify which element in the array we are working with, and we use the character `'if'` to loop until we get to the last item in the file.  The `.readlines()` method from the `file` object returns an iterator of lines in the file, and we can use the `.next()` method in a `for x in total_bill:` to display the elements of the array.", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "The answer is to fix one toilet, one shower and three sinks. I calculate it like this:  It costs the plumber $50 to fix the toilet.  That leaves 20 to 30 left over.  We can divide 50 by 20 and we get that he can earn $2.50 per toilet.  It costs $40 to fix the shower, or $20 left to spend for each shower.  And it costs $30 to fix the sink, or $10 for each sink.  So we can spend $2.50 on a toilet to earn $30.  And $10 for a sink to earn $20.  Which means a sink and a toilet, in order to spend a total of 20-30 left to earn $35.53, the difference being the $4.47 change.\n\n### Input\nIn the story of _Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland_ the main character grows larger and smaller depending on her size in relation to the other characters she meets in the story.

{"text": "$7.00\n\n### Explanation for the Instruction\nYou are in a tutorial for the instruction. The computer has asked you for input on what questions to answer. You need to determine what type of questions are going to be asked. You also have to choose among the five pre-determined choices. Once you choose a question, you will be prompted to enter the solution by way of a keyboard entry.\n\n### Expected Output\nYou are in a live session with a computer that asks you questions, but does not supply the correct answers. You are required to think out the answers and to give each answer in the form of a response to the computer. A response should include all capitals. At the end of the session, the computer will respond to your response by prompting you for another response.\nYou should be familiar with how the software works. You are the best judge of how to proceed.\n\n### Certainty That Answers Are Correct\nIt is difficult to know that your answers will be correct. It is difficult to know that anything that your computer is doing is correct. If you get a response that differs from what you think it should be, you may want to repeat your response. This may be a hint.\n\n### Guaranteed Input\nIt is difficult, but not impossible, to identify any given input in any session. There is no guarantee, at any time, whether any given prompt is input or output. If you see a response that is correct, and the computer responds with some other response, chances are that something is wrong with the software. This should be reported back to the authors if you have the opportunity to do so. You are not expected to do this. The best thing that you can do is to try to repeat your response. If you cannot get the same response, then the software is broken. There is no other way to do this. There is no diagnostic information available to you.\n\n### Helpful Hint\nLook at the question to try and figure out in which type of world the question is being asked in. Try and figure out if the answer to a question will be numeric or alphabetic.\n\n### Example\nInput: There are 365 days in a year. How much money will the federal government save if the federal government closes for 5 days and does not pay for day care? Choices: \n\n##", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "The response should indicate in words or formulas the cow's weight gained. This should be the input number multiplied by its starting weight.  The answer should indicate in words how much more it is worth after gaining the weigh.\n\n### Rationale\nOne way to express a mathematical problem as a sentence is to use nouns to indicate variables.  Each variable represents a math quantity or numbers.  The response should use nouns from the list such as \"weight\" or \"400\". Another way to express the math is to replace the variable using words (as appropriate).  One common error is to not use sufficient words to express the math variable.\n\nNote: the input will be a math expression. The response should provide a mathematical solution as a formula or a numerical answer.\n\nExplanations: Avoid using numbers unless you are responding to an input. It is up to the assessor to express the input number.\n\nNote: Your answer will be judged using the example.  You may need to show all your work. The assessor may need to see explanations.  The assessor may also need to have additional explanation about why an error in your answer may be considered acceptable.\n\n### Response to instructions:\nWrite a response in the comments area.

Your paragraph should start by stating what the speed is, and then you should show your work for each of the three conditions listed, and then you should subtract the numbers and convert. This will give you the average speed.\n\n### Improvement Opportunities \nLook carefully at the example you were given above. Try to figure out what part (if any) of the problem is being used for the question.  The above example has a few clues that you can extract to help you with this assignment. For instance, the speed could be found using the given values, \u201c12 miles per hour and \u201c18 miles per hour.\u201d Another clue is that the average speed has to be rounded to the tenth in this problem, so those numbers can be used to calculate the average.\nThe goal is to figure out what kind of information is given to help determine the answer.\n\n### Additional Instructions:\n1.

There are other possibilities though.\n2.  See the \"Demo\" for an idea on what input might look like.\n3.   We gave you a sample output to complete.  In practice, you will use \"console.log\" statements to print data to your terminal.\n\n### Suggested Strategies\n1.  Think of data structures (lists, etc).  Using data structures is a good way to avoid using too many (or at all)  global variables.  Data structures are usually also easier to work with in a number of programming languages.\n2.  Avoid global variables and functions in case the data/functions aren't needed outside of this program.  You may want to declare any data outside of the function as variables (const or let).  These data types will let you store constant data values and those data values will not change.\n3.  You cannot use \"for\" loops in this challenge.  Instead you should use \"function\" parameters.\n4.   Remember to check your data.  You should do this to test your code to make sure it gives the correct outputs at least once.\n5.   For example:  What are possible inputs that will give a desired result?\n\n### Expected Output\n1.  Use data structures (e.g. lists, etc.).\n2.

Since her sister has diaries she has diaries (not the plural of diary which is \"diaries\" but is singular so in other words that she was not \"stupid enough\" to confuse what she has diaries to \"has diaries\"). Since \"the number of her diaries doubled in last summer\" and that does not mean an increase of 1 so we have to subtract 1 to find the number of diaries that her 8 diaries have increased by (a decrease of 1 means an increase of the number without a 1).

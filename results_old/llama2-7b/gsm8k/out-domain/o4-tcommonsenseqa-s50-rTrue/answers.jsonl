Assuming that each fish tank has an equal number of each size of fish, the total number of fish in the respective tanks would be 69: 2 x (9 + 3) + 48 = 69. Now, let's assume that a two-inch fish eats another fish in the first tank. Since each tank has an equal number, the total number of two- inch fish in the first tank would be (2 x 9 + 2) = 20. Substituting 20 for n and solving for m, 20 * 20 = 69; m * n = 20 * 3 = 60 (where m > n); m \u2013 n = 6 * 6 = 36. Substituting m = 20 and n = 9 in the above equation, m \u2013 n = 15.

{"text": "Pam has 12 bags.\n\n### Input & Rationales:\n1. Consider the ratio of apples in bags: 3:1 = 40:12\n2. From the given question, the denominator is the total number of apples Pam has while the numerator represents the number of bags.\n3. If 3 bags have 4 times many apples as each bag in Gerald's collection, then the number of bags Pam has has to be 4/3 of 40 = 12/3 = 12\n\n### How did you find the solution?\n* Divide the total apples by the total number of bags to get the total number of appples in each bag\n* Then, divide 1200 by that to get the number of bags\n\n### Input&Rationales:\n\n1. We have the expression 3 of Gerald\u2019s bags = 40 Pam\u2019s bags or 40/3 of Gerald\u2019\n2. We can solve the equation using variables as follows:\n3. Subtract 40/3 (Gerald\u2019s bags) from 1200 (total number of apples) to get 800 apples left.\n4. Since there are three Gerald\u2019s bays and each bay has less number of apples, there are 800 appies remaining per Gerald\u2019s baggage.\n5. So to solve the total number of Geralds bags required to be 800, we substitute 800 appes in the numerator: 40/800 = 3\n6.

Each block of cheese typically comes with instructions or a label regarding how many servings are in each block of cheese.  As mentioned in the question, Rick buys the large block that has 16 servings, meaning that each block is the equivalent of eight servgings.

How fast did the second person travel?\n\n### Rationale:\n  * The first and second person are two individuals and they travel 9 miles in the same amount of time. Given that the first person moves at the same speed as the second, the second person's speed can be 1/2 what the first person's is.\n  * Using the equation [Traveled distance = Speed * Traveled time], 1 person = 1 speed, so if the first person's speed is 1/2 the speed of the second person, [Traveled distance: person 1] = 1/2 * [Traveled time: person 1].

The answer choice should consider the cost (expenses) of the pineapples as $3 x 6 and the income (revenue) from the sales of pineapples as sales price x 12, which is $5 x 12 or $60. Therefore, the total profit made would be $3 x 6 - $60, or $3 x -$54 and the answer would be $42.\n* The solution to the problem is 3 x -54 divided by 6, which equals $42/6 or $7.\n* Note: If multiple operations were necessary to solve this problem, then we could have divided total cost ($3 x 6) by total income from pineapples ($5 x 12) to reduce the values to like terms to avoid division.\n\n![](../../public/assets/img/2_3.png)\n\n### Expert:\n* Rationals: As written in the explanation above.\n* The answer is correct.\n\n# 4-1\n\n### Instrucation:Answer the following grade question.\n\n## Demonstration: How do you determine whether a statement is true or false?\n\n* 1.

It means one pound of pitted cherries per person.\n2. 'one pound of cherries' refers to one pound of pits.\n3. '10 minutes to pit two cherries': This phrase can be rewritten as 'ten minute to pit one cherry' because the same amount of time is used to pit one cherry or two cherries.\n4. After rewriting the phrase as 'ten minute to pin one cherry,' we can say that 'ten minute to pit the cherry' means that at the end of ten minutes there will be no pitted cherries left to pin in that time period.\n5.

{"text": "It's 20% likely that Andy will lose both lawsuits. This is because we can say that the chance of making money on the two lawsuits is (0.3 * 5,000000) + (0.5 * 2,0000,0) = 25000,0 + 1000,0 = 3500000 = $3.5M. While the sum of these numbers is positive, the possibility that Andy will lose a lawsuit is higher than that of winning them, which is why it is 20% likely. You can also notice that it is the product of multiplying two 10% probabilities, which means that it's 200% more likely that Andy will lose the lawsuits than the amount of money that he can make from them.  Thus, it's concluded that the chance of winning a lawsuit is 25% compared to losing them, which is a 200% worse chance for the lawyer.\n\nInput: What does the letter \"N\" stand for in a baseball game?

{"text": "Jimmy needs to buy 4 packs of bread.  \n\n### Rationales:\n1. There are 8 sandwiches to make. In this case we can say that there are 2 slices of bread for each sandwich, because Jimmy only uses 2 slices to make each sandwich.\n2. We have the equation: P x 2 = 8\n3. Since we are multiplying 8 by 2 in order to get the number of sandwiches, we can conclude that 8 sandwiches are the equivalent of 2 slices of 4 slices = 8 slices (assuming sandwiches require 2 slices of each bread).  \n\nThus, in order to create 8 sandwiches, Jimmy needs to get the equivalent to 8 slices of 4-slice packs of bread.\n\nWe can write: 8 = 2p\n4. We can also note that we have 4 on the left side of the equation, which means that we need 8 to get to 2. We can write down 4 + 8 = 2, therefore, we need 4 + 8 to get from 8 to 2.\n5. Hence, by making the equation y + 4 = 2, we have 4 + 8 \u225c 2 \u225c 8 and 4 + y = 2 for y = slices of bread needed to make sandwiches.\n6. We can multiply 8 by 4, which equals 32.

So we can not continue to solve for $W$.\n\n### Demand:How much money did Noemi lose?\n\n### Solution: The player lost $800 and started with $500 (not including the $800).\\bbox[green]{400 \\le W < 800}\n\n### Demands:What does the first set of information tell us about the possible amount Noemi began with?\n\n### Solutions:The first piece of information says that she lost $800, so she started off with less than $800. The 2nd question has to do with $500. If she started with $-500 and lost $400 then she begins with $900. If she lost $-800, she will begin with $-180.\n\n### Inputs and Rationales:\n\n### Democracy should be protected because the goal of the Constitution is to protect democracy.\nDemocracy should be protected because it's the goal of the Constitution to protect democracy. Let's explain.\n\nA constitution is a collection of basic or fundamental rights and principles that are shared by a society, and it serves as the set of rules or law that governs them. A democracy is a political system that involves the participation of the citizenry in decision-making processes. Thus, the Constitution's goal of promoting democracy is important in ensuring that citizens' rights are exercised and protected as per the principles set out in it.

Therefore, Roger should buy 26 packs of trail mix.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFor the first step, a solution is applied to find the answer. In this case, it's by dividing the \"6 individuals\" into the \"team members\" in order to know the total number.\n\n```\nlet divide by 7 = 1 individual / 7 \n```\n\n### Second step:\n\nIn this second step, you describe what you've done from the first step. In this case, you wrote down 13 (that's the player's number) that you mentioned in the first step.\n\n```\nThe number of individual pouches needed for the baseball team is 13, divided by 7 equals 2 with remaining pouches and not full.\nSo that is to say that there are 13-2 players in the baseball team.\nRoger would also need the coaches and help to have a snack (the trail mix) that could satisfy their appetites.

{"text": "James watched 12 episodes of Wheel Of Fortune\n\n### Rationale:\n\nIn the original challenge there's an explicit instruction to \"choose one\" and the answer is \"12 episodes of WOF\". This challenge is a bad test of the skill, because \"Jeopardy\" is not the second episode of \"Jeopardy.\" The question is intended to demonstrate how to create a good answer.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. Watched Jeopardy twice\n2. Two episodes of Jeopard.\n3. watched 2 episodes of WOF (Watched Jeopardy Twice)\n\n### Rerun\n\n### Reteach instructions:\n\nThis problem requires the learner to count and evaluate time intervals between different TV shows. The question asks how many total minutes were spent watching the tv shows, where each show\u2019s episode lasts 20 minutes and one of the shows is doubly the length of the other.\nThe correct answer is 80 minutes - 120 minutes \u2248 8 minutes. The key here is to understand that when comparing one episode to another, we do not consider the length of the longest show which is \"Jeopardy\".\nWhat we do instead is consider the other show \"wheel of fortune\", which only exists in this scenario. Once we have established that these two shows can serve as a comparison, simply subtract the lengths of the two shows together from the number of minutes spent watching the shows. With that being said, the answer we are looking for is 80 minutes (watched jeopardy twice) - 120 (20 *2) = 8.\nIf you were wondering why answer E wasn't selected, it is because according to the problem instructions, any other choice besides the selected answer is incorrect.\n\n### New instructions\n\n### New rationales:\n\n- The first rule to remember while solving this problem is to think about the lengths of the episodes of the television shows provided. We can see that there are two episodes of Jeopard! and two episodes of Wheel of fortune. Thus, when referring to each episode, it should be referred to as \"one episode of Jeopard!\" and \"two episodes of Wheel of fortun\".\n\n- Once we have established the duration of each episode, we then need to subtract the durations", "answer": " 2"}

Choices:  a)10 b)18 c)20 d)22 e)24\nRationales:1. The question is about finding a specific mathematical sum of all the even integers between two given numbers.\n2. Begin by determining the given numbers, then calculate the even integers between them.\n3. The given pairs of numbers is 14 and 22, which contain 19 even integers, including 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.\n4. Therefore, the answer can be determined by summing all the even integers between the two given numbers.\n5. The given number 22 is added to every even number on its right, while the number 14 is subtracted from every even number on its left.\n6. The sum of the series of even integers is 180.\n7. Then, subtracting the smaller number from the first and adding it to the larger one equals 26, 28, 32, and so on.\n8. If a certain number is even, it's even again. So take the first number and add it to the second number. This means that 26 and 28 will appear as 54, then 70 will be 94, and so on.

Therefore, distance covered in 2 minutes = 1 mile = 65/120    Distance 2 to initial destination(point1) = 65/2 = 32.5 miles   Total distance covered in 2 hours = 32.     Hence, total distance = (55 + 10) = 65   Time taken to reach  destination =  2 minutes per 1 mile = 20 mins   Total time taken(20 mins + 5 mins) to reach destination plus total time taken (23 mins + 4.5 mins) to cover distance back = 43.5 mins      Therefore, total time = 43. 5 mins, which is 80 mins because there are 55 minutes and there are 30 minutes in 1 hour = 80 mins.\n\n### Input:\"Are you getting in?\"\"Do I have a choice?\"\n\n### Response:\"I think he means whether or not I will ride his tricycle.\"  This statement could be considered ironic or sarcastic.\n\n### Explanaton:  It is sarcastic because the driver is suggesting that it's his choice whether the passengers get in, but the passengers are not given the choice.

You can think of the first two weeks as \"consecutive,\" which means that the first two and the last two weeks both have 4 weeks each. So you can add 4 to 2 to get 6.\n5. The answer to the first two weeks would be 8 for two consecutive weeks. And the answer to the last two weeks would be 9 for two consecutive weeks.\n6. In a span of 7 weeks, there are three consecutive weeks; so the answer is three.\n7. So the average for 7 weeks is 3 (number of weeks) (1/3 of 8) + 3 (1/3 of nine) + 3 (one-third of six) + 3 (number of apples a day over 7 weeks)\n8. Subtracting 3 from 2 (3/2) would give you 1/2 = 4/7, which is an average of 4 (one-third 12) for the first two weeks, 4 (one-thrid of nine) for the next 3 weeks, 4 (three-fifth) for the last two weeks. \n9. 3 (the number of apples a day for 7 weeks) and 4/7 (1/2 x 12) (the number of appels a two weeks for 7 weeks).\n10. The answer is four apples a day for three consecutive weeks.\n\n### Rationale: There are more than 600,000 different items in a typical supermarket, but the most popular supermarket item is bananas.\n\n### Description: A supermarket is a self-service retail store that sells a large variety of", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "Carl can type 2,000 words in 7 days.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question asks to calculate the number of words Carla can type during a 7-day period, given the information that she types at a speed of about 50 words per min.\n2. To get the answer, divide the number of words per minute by 1 (since 1 minute = 60 seconds). This gives us about 33.3 words per second.\n3. Then, multiply this by the number of seconds per day (60) and add that value to the result. We get 4.3 words per second * 60 = 258 words.\n4. Finally, multiply this figure by 7 days = 1,716 words per day. Sum the result to get a total of 1,717 words. We can see that the answer is 1,713 words.", "answer": " 84000"}

{"text": "The answer is 41. \n\n### Rationales:  Let's first look at the entrance charge.  It will be $4 no matter how many strawberries are picked.  With the strawberries picked, each person will take the strawberries to the scales where Miguel will deduct $4 and price the amount of strawberries.  Sally, Jenny, and Moses are each picking on their own, so they will be taking their $128 harvest to get priced and pick up with the strawberries, so they each have $124 left each.  Therefore, each of them has 30 pounds of strawberries each.  And since each of them paid $4, they have $32 left for themselves to put towards weighing their strawberries.\n\n\n### Alternative Response:41.\n\n### Rationale:  The question asks you how many strawberies they picked.  Since there are 3 charges per person to get in the strawberry fields, and each picker is getting 30 strawberries each, you multiply $128 by 3 to get $384 total, and since there are 3 charges, $128 is left for each person, and since each person is getting $32 for themselves, you can get a total of $32 per person times $4, and then get the remaining $24 per person.  This gives you 41 strawberries. And since it says they paid $41, there was a little math error and they paid more than they collected for each person.\n\n\n## Solution 2\n\nOutput: The carpenter was wearing a red vest because he was going to be working at a hardware store. What did he buy? Choices:  Red jacket  Red blouse  Red pants\n\nIdeal Response:Red pants.\n\nRationale:Based on the wording of the question, the key point is that the choice (C) should not be mentioned. This is because the question specifies that the carpenter is wearing red, thus it would be wrong to say that the carpenter bought any clothes that are red. Therefore, the choice is to say that the carrier bought red pants.\n\nOutput", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "The town received 120 inches of rainfall in November.\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe problem describes a total of 15 days where the rainfall was 4 inches per day. The remaining time, the amount of rainfall was double the initial amount. The number of days in the period is 15+15=30 in the remainder of the month. If it takes 15 days to reach the same number of rainfall, let t be the duration of this period in days, then\n`((15*4)+2(t-15)) = 30`\nAdding the equation above in a common form,\n`60+2t-75=0`\nDifferentiating by 2 and substituting 60 for 2t-75, we get `2(t-13)\u22123(t-7) = \u221240` which reduces to\n`(t\u22122) = \u221220`\nTherefore, the total number of days is `((t-2)/15)\\) = 1.3 \u2248 1.333 (3 signifies that 30/2 = 15 = 10/2 = 5 = 3 = 2)`.\n\nNow substituting `(t-2)/12) = 1.08333` into the original equation `((15*4) + (1.083*30-15)) = (15*4) \u2248 15*4 = 60`\n\nHence, total rainfall is`(60*1.083) = 66.5`.\n\nThus, the total amount of rains in a town in November is `60+66.5 = 126.5`", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": "Demonstration:\n1. First, determine the net profit to see how much they make from selling the chickens.\n2. $65 profit means an additional cost of (($65-$20)/20)$5.25 to every pound of feed consumed.\n3. $5.25 means that each 2 pounds of feed will cost $10.50.\n4. Therefore, the feed costs $10.5 each\n5. Finally, multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed needed, then subtract them from the profit to determine the number of chickets sold.\n6. Net profit = $65 *(4.25) = $270.\n7. There are 20 pounds of feed and 80 chickens will require 2 pounds each from their hatch to their death.\n8.

{"text": "The total number of spider is: 168\n\n### Demostration:\n\nLet's first consider what we mean by 'a single spider.' This is best understood by considering the units from which the figure 168 is made up. The'single spider' represents '8' which is the spider's natural and default state. In other words, the '168' that we arrive at in the end represents how many spiders that group has.\n\nLet's now examine the two parts of the task. In the first part of the task, we learn that the total number of spiders is 10 more than half the number of spider legs that a single spider has. In other words, we find that the group of spiders has twice as many spiders as legs. So, in terms of the units, 168 is twice as much as 8 (the default state of a spider). Therefore, the total number of spidery legs in the group of spiders must be 168 (the sum of both units, spiders and legs).\n\nIn the second part of the task, however, we are given some additional information about the figure 8: \"that of the figure given, if 2 were added to each leg, each leg would then be the figure 6, and adding 6 to each spider, each spider would then have the figure 12.\" This clarifies the units that were previously in question: Each spider leg is 2 and each spider is 6 (12 is the sum of the each).

A typical adult weighs 50-60 kg (110-130 lb).\n2. As stated above the typical adult weighs in kg, not Gs, gs, or lbs. \n3. According to the dictionary \"kg\" means kilogram. \n4. A single g or G is used in physics to represent the gravitational force. \n5. A single lb is used in the United States as the unit of weight. \n6. A unit of weight does not have a prefix. \n7.

{"text": "1. Let's start by simplifying the question into its three parts (the ticket prices, the duration, and the number of rides per month).\n2. From the ticket prices, we can see that a one-way ticket is $2, and a 30-day ticket is $50.\n3. On the other hand from the duration, a 30-days pass implies the rides should be taken in one month, not every day of a month.\n4. And the third part is the number of rides that need to be taken each month.\n5. Let's analyze it. $50 is equivalent to 25 rides, since we know a 30-dies pass means taking the rides in one month, not each day of the month. \n6. Also we must choose our answer in such a way that we take the number of rides to not exceed 25.\n7. As a result, we can conclude that the answer is 2.\n8. The least rides you can take every month so that taking 30 rides in one month is cheaper than 25 rides every month is 2.\n9. In other words, you will need to take at least 2 rides every month.\n10.

The phrase'storm' refers to a severe weather event occurring in short duration, often resulting in rain or hail. Generally, people will not go to the store during a storm.\n2. The options listed are the only common nouns that would describe the weather, and all options, except for sun, have the potential to cause rain.\n3. 'Sun' (option B) suggests the opposite of rain due to its impact on the climate, however, the sun can still bring about rain since it causes heat which then causes water from the soil to rise as vapor and meet the clouds which fall back down in the form of rain.\n4. Snow (option D) is a weather phenomenon that can still precipitate or cause rain, however, it is not possible based on the context of the question.\n5. Hail (option E) is a form of precipitation that may accompany severe weather, however, it isn't specifically mentioned in the question or the phrase 'rain' which would have come after'storm' making it inappropriate for the answer.\n6. Hence option C is the most", "answer": " 30"}

However, the supplier of the roofing offers to give 250 of the required 300 ft for free, which means that Mr. Caiden would only need to pay for the remaining 50 ft (300 - 250 feet). If we assume that the 250 free feet cost the supplier $200 (250 * $8), then Mr. Caiden would need to pay $60 (+$200) to the supplier for the remaining 5 ft (250 - 50 feet) of metal roofing, for a total cost of $180.

To multiply the amount each month equals the amount per head of the lettuce times the number of head consumed.  \n\nThe second is similar but to calculate the total revenue, it is the total cost of each head of lettuce multiplied by how many will be bought by customers.\n\nThus in this case the total amount spent on lettuces, the amount each customer costs, is $162 times 20, the number of heads bought each month.\n\nThe second is equivalent to the cost, per lettuce, which in this case is $8, which is the cost of a head of lettuce. Multiplying this cost per head of lettuce by the number of lettuces sold gives the total amount consumed.\n\nThe total revenue received by Village Foods can then be calculated by taking the cost per head of lettucces and multiplying it by the number of heads sold,\n\nTotal revenue is:240$", "answer": " 2000"}

{"text": "48 cups\n\n### Explanation:Let's work through the question.\n\n## Solution:\nA dog of the poodle breed is about 37 inches (94 cm) high and weighs about 15 pounds (7 kg), so let us estimate the weight of a cup of kibble to be about 6 oz (170 g).  This means that the maximum quantity of kibble that a poodle of moderate size can eat is about 6 lb (3 kg).  If the answer is to be rational and logical, it makes sense to limit the amount of kibble that both Mary and Frank can individually give to Luna.  But even with a more modest and reasonable limit of 1/2 lb (250 g) of kibble per feeding, Mary's method of giving 1 cup in the morning and 2 cups in the evening still leaves about 2 more cups (of maximum 6 lb (3.5 kg)) of kibble for Luna.", "answer": " 7"}

To calculate the number of days between the injury and starting to lift again, we multiply the time needed for the injury to heal by the 5.\n3. We know James hurt himself exercising, so we multiply 5 by 3 days to get 15. We subtract the 15 from the 15 to get a remainder of 1.\n4.

'Country' is a broad category while 'neighborhood' is specific to a building.\nThen, compare the houses for the choices and see which homes may match the description.\n\n1. a: If a house is 'in the country,' it means that it is located in a rural area or a region that is far away from a city.

A: 0 days 2. B: 4/3 days 3. C: 5 days 4. D: indefinite time E: 5/3 days\nRationales:1. The question says that if one eats seven sevenths of a certain item per day, at what rate is it consumed, or in how long will it last.\n2. The rate at which one is eating needs to be computed since it's equal to the number of days consumed item is left for consumption.\n3. Since (7/2) multiplied by the rate of 4/3, the rate of consumption would be (9+1/2)/3.\n4. 9/2 can be simplified to 4/3.\n5. The amount of food left for consumption is determined by taking 4/3 and subtracting 7/2 from this expression.\n6. Therefore, to find which expression gives the remaining amount of food, substitute 7/2 into 1-4/3\n7.  In the expression above, the number of days that the food has remaining is 4/3.

{"text": "The answer to the question is 160 froggets.\n\n### Explanation: In the given problem, we are given the information that the number of dogs is 160, which makes the number of cats 128. Next, we are given information about the ratio of dogs to frogs, meaning that there are twice as many frogs in the compound as dogs. This means that there are 320 frogs in the compounds. Finally, we are also given the constraint that there is a 20% reduction in the number of cats compared to dogs, which means that there is a 12.8% reduction in the number if dogs compared to the number of cats. This means that there would be 48 fewer dogs, or a total of 111 dogs. This information is already provided as part of the explanation, so it can be left out. Finally, since we are given the total number of dogs in the problem and the total number of frogs, we know the total number of animals must be the sum of these two values: \\[160 + 320 = 480\\].

Hence after 7 min, Matt will have gone 12 feet / 0.21 = 55.28 feet farther down the pole than Jason. Now Matt's distance from the pole is equal to the height of the pole minus the height of the ground, so his distance after 7 minutes is: 7*(55.28) - 0 = 387.8 feet. (the height of the pole is: height of the pole = distance from the ground to the pole - height of the ground= 10 + 5 = 15 feet) Now Jason's distance from the top is greater than Matt's by 35.9 feet, which means that he is 35.9 higher than Matt.\n\nAnswer: Jason is 35.13 feet = 35.18 meters = 115 feet 6.3 inches further up than Matt.\n\n### Input\uff1aThe length of the sides of a rectangle is 6 feet and the width of the rectangle is 2 meters.

There were 110 people in the party.\n2. Everyone brought water; not every person brought a bag.\n3. Hence, 7 to 4 = 140 guests.\n4. A person only brings 4 water bottles to the party which means 110/4 or 27 water bottles were brought by a person.\n5. If every person brought 4 water bottles each to the party, how many people brought water in party?\n6.

He Can Buy Half Of Them for 50 Percent Off of 0.50, The Other Five Six Hundred he needs to buy full price. How Many Dollars Does Tom spend? We can solve this equation by substituting: Bricks = (100/2)*5 = 20. 100/2 to avoid rounding up with fractions. Half Is 50% off. And The Other Half Is 50%, Which Means To Get 50% Off Of 50%. It Is (0.5*5) Or ($50/2) = 20. Now To Get The Amount In Full, We Substitute (100/5)*$1000 = $2000. Now To Pay Just One Half, We Need To Subtract The Frugal Amount Of 2000 And That Leaves Us At $1500. Now That Leaves Two More 0.50 Or (50% Off Of The Full Price) 4500 (50% Off) Or (2000 * 0.5) = 1000. Now We Pay 2000 + 1000 For Half. This Will Give Us The Answer $1500 For $2500.", "answer": " 375"}

After the first lattes she had to use the restroom and went to the store located across from the coffee shop to buy a water.  She only had enough cash to pay for the water.  How much did she spend on the water?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nFirst, let's assume that the water costs $0.99.\nSecondly, we can calculate the discount by using the multiplication and division methods.  The original cost of the latte is $18, which is divided by the discount amount of $0.40, which results in an overpayment of $12.  This overpayment can be deducted from the cost of the water, which gives us an answer of $11.69.\n\nAnswer: We can confirm that the answer is 11.69 by adding 18, 12 and 0.40.\n\n\n### How to Respond\n\n```js\n/* In this exercise, write responses to sample tasks that require one or more rationales for each choice.

However, when we look at the powers of two, we notice that each number is double the previous one.\n3. This can be represented by the expression of (2 * n), where n is the term and 2 is the power of one.\n4. Thus, we can substitute 20 for every term from 10^2 to 10^22 and sum the products of those expressions.\n5. This amounts to: 10^(2*10)^(2*9)+10^(2*8)^(2*7)+10^(2*`n)^(2*0)\n6. Then, we can write the sequence as: (2*(10^2))^1_n+(2*(10^3))^1_n+((2*(10^4)))^1_n+(2*10^5))^1_n....\n7. Next, we rearrange the first and second terms and simplify the second term, which gives us 160.\n8. Sum the products of the remaining two sequence: (160) + (153) + (146) +... + (20) = 2420.\n9.

{"text": "Roque goes to work by walking and biking. Therefore, the answer to the question is six hours.\n\n### Input I: The referee called the game when there were ten minutes remaining in the second half, so the final score was 10\u20139.\n### Response I: The players played for two halves, each of 90 minutes each. Because the referee gave a fulltime score at the end of the match, hence the full time was 90x2=180 minutes. So, the halves were each 180/2 = 90 minutes. As there were 10 minutes remaining in the second, halftime, we have to subtract 10 minutes from the first half, then add those 10 from the second, giving us a final halftime remaining of 40 minutes. So halftime remaining = (2 x 90 - 10) - 10 = 110 minutes.

{"text": "Herman will need 3 cups of food for the three months.\n<img src=\"../assets/images/mathwordproblem2.png\" />\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. First, we need to identify the cups to be consumed in a day:  1/2 cup in morning and 1/12 cup in afternoon.\n2. Next, we identify the number of cups to be consuming through 3 months:  3 months =  3 cups in 1 month.\n3. And finally, we combine the two to find that Herman will need 2 cups + 3 cups = 5 cups of food for all three months.\n\n### InputHow many ounces are in 12 gallons?\n\n### Rationales:\n1. 12 gallons is a higher number, so it equals 12 x 8 which equals 96.\n2. To understand how to solve this, you need to understand that an ounce is a unit of measurement and that a gallon contains 16 ounces. \n\n### InputHelen earned 35 cents in total from her sales on Wednesday and Thursday.

What do I like to do? Choices: \nA: read B: paint C: dance D: write E: write music\nRationales :1. First, identify the things that make up music and are involved in singing: reading, writing, dancing, painting, and playing with a musical instrument.\n2. Then, the question asks what the likes do as a whole, namely the words and phrases that fall into reading, writing, dancer, painting, or playing music.\n3. One can notice that the given choices do not express a direct preference for singing and playing music, with 'dancing' and 'writing music' not being clear options for that preference.\n4. For example, writing refers to the creation of writings, which may involve reading, but it's not directly about the act of singing by itself; it's the act of writing about singing or creating other types of related materials.\n5. This explains why the answer to the question is not writing, because it does not specify a direct interest in singing, nor does it suggest that writing has a direct relation to singing, as the phrase \"write music\" does.\n6.

The division process is done for both dividends and divisors. The first step is to determine the division method. There are two methods \u2013 exact division and approximation division.\n3. In approximation division, some digits are rounded to get an approximate result. 300 divided by 3 is equal to 100 rounding 300 to the nearest whole number. 3 divided by 3 is 1. Thereafter, we can determine 99 divided by (rounded) 3. 99 divided by three, equal to 33, is the approximate answer.\n4. However, if the 300 division is done in exact division, some digits and fractions will be used. In this case, the 300 is equal to (100 +.125 +.375) + 3 which is equal to 131.125. And 3 divided by 401.125 gives 0.074945. Therefore, the answer to the question is E, which is 99 / 3 = 33 and 33 / 3 = 11. The final answer is 99 / (3 * 2) = 11\n\nAnswer: E: 99 / ( 3 * 2 ) = 11", "answer": " 21"}

Would it appear closer or farther away?  Where does your line of sight go when the sun rises or sets? \n\nRationales:\nTo correctly answer the question, the line of sight needs to travel the shortest possible path between the sun and subject (e.g., you). At the same time, this path has to be an unobstructed one at all time so that your eye doesn't skip over any obstacles in its way. Once it travels from a single point (the sun) and reaches another point (you), no other point should lie on this path along its entirety or else the path becomes longer by a distance corresponding to the length of that obstacle.\n\nIn this scenario, if we represent our eye and the object with corresponding points on a plane, then we can say that the line of sight goes in one of two directions: downward or sideways. The former would take away from the distance that exists between our eyes and the object in question while doing more work along the way which adds to overall distance traveled - if we assume that both travel times are equal then", "answer": " 360"}

However, we know that Mark played 20 of the 100 minutes of the game, we subtract the minutes Mark played from the total minutes and obtain the total remainder of minutes: 70 - 20 = 50. Next we divide 50 minutes by 35 minutes to obtain the remainder. We multiply both the remainder and what we subtracted to get a number, which is 50/35 = 1.4 and 100 minutes - 20 minutes = 80 minutes. Therefore we multiply the remainder by 1.4 to get 50 x 1.4 = 70 minutes, then we need to subtract the remainder and what we added. We have 50 - 70 = 20 minutes.

A: $120,000 B: $39,900 C: $38,000 D: $41,000 E: $51,000\nRationales:\n1. Ecommerce revenues were $28,015 more than offline revenues (option B). However, an increase in ecommerce means it made $50,015 more revenues than offline sales, implying it made more money online.\n2. $5,001 difference in revenue (option A) and ecommerce revenues does not work as a total number, hence can be discarded. This is also because we have to consider the overall revenue on the online platform only, not the profit made or the difference of the platforms.\n3. On the online platform, the company made $39,995 more revenue than offline sales (option C), which means it made more money online than offline.\n4. Finally, the answer is D: $410 for the following reason.\n    1. It is clear that, the company made more revenues online compared to offline. To calculate a figure, we must multiply the revenue earned online by 1.4 i.e. $40,995 (Option D).

Based on the context in the question, you have to determine the maximum number of hours Mark will need, and the output needs to be a mathematical number with at least two digits and a decimal point following the first digit.\n\n### 1. Analysis:\n\nThe question asks for 46 hours and zero minutes but the time in hours only has two digits and the decimal point comes before the first digit. So the time needs to be two digits not 3.\n\nThere are also other mistakes in the question.\n\n**Mark wants to set the world record for rope jumping.**\n\nThe world record for rope jumper is 36,645. The last three zeros in the world record for ropes jump are not needed.\n\n**The question states that Mark can only jump by 3 times a second which means we have to solve using the equation.**\n\n**Now the equation will be:**\n\n300 hours * 3600 minutes/hour = 108,000 minutes/day * 5 days = 540,000/5 days = 1080,000 *(1 second/300 jumps) = 360,000 or 360 seconds so our formula should be 360 seconds/time to achieve the record\n\n**Since Mark can jump 3 times in a second, then 360/3 is equal to 120 jumps a minute.*\n\n**Since the question asks for 54,0 hundred jumps, the minutes will be 54,0 x 120/3 = 36,000 so 36000 minutes in 46 hours**.\n\nHence the answer is 3600\n\n### Output:\n3600", "answer": " 5"}

Therefore, the answer will be not A.\n    B. The theme of the novel is about the difficulties, not about the novelist's difficult life (not C).\n    D. Because the second sentence doesn't mention the struggles experienced by the book, the book isn't about difficult life in the United States (not D).\n    The theme of the book isn't life in America.\n\n### 1st sentence explanation:The author of the novel says the novel is about a very bad life in China. But the novel isn't about a very difficult life in China. The author has written the novel and lives outside China. Therefore, the novel is not about the difficulties the author had experienced in China. Then, when the author says, \"I am a stranger,\" he says, \"I am living in America, but I am a stranger.\" Then the author will talk about his feelings.

Each time a game ends, the program should print out the player with the most points and the total of points of all the players. If more than one player has an equal number of points, the player who was winning the last game should be printed out.\n\n### Input Format:\nEach input case begins with a player name; each case has 2 lines, the first line is player's name and second line is the scores of player\n\n### Sample Input:\nJohn 20\nRoberto 25\nJose 10\nRoberto won 3-0\n\n### Sample Output:\nThe winner is Roberto. The total score is 38\n### Explain the solution\n- Here our two dimensional array is one-dimensional and our each element is of type int.\n- we have 3 player in this game. We assume that player name starts with 0;\n- So we have array of size 4 with first element storing value of player with name Jose.\n- We will increase the point of a player by adding another element to our array.\n- We will keep track of last winning player. When any player wins game, we will assign that value to variable 'winning_player'. For that we will also keep track of all the players.\n- We will print only the points of winning player and total of all the other players.\n\n### Code:\n```\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n\tint[][] player = new int[4];\n\tint winning_player = 0;\n\tint total = 0;\n\n\tfor (int i=0;i<player.length;i++){\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Enter player #\" + (i+1));\n\t   Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);", "answer": " 2,250"}

{"text": "6.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. The question asks how many birds there are producing the sound heard coming out of the owl.\n2. We can say that each owl hoot sounds five times per minute.\n3. The number of hoot sounds heard is five less than the number of seconds it takes.\n4. The question provides 20 seconds, not 20 hoots (since there's an extra zero in \"20\").\n5.  Since five equals five, we can assume the question expects us to count in minutes -- so we need to multiple to 30 instead of 20.\n6. Therefore, there are 30 hoots per minute, which means one owl is making 5 hoots every minute.\n\n### Solution:\n1. 5 hoot sounds are made every minute\n2. If 5 less than what is heard is heard out of the barn\n    * If this is 30 hoot sounds heard coming from the barn\n        * 5 less than what comes out of the barn is the remainder\n         * 5 - (5x1) = 0\n        * 5 is used as a multiple for 30 hooting sounds\n        * 30 divided by 5\n          * 6 is the answer to 5 hoot sounds coming out of the barnyard owl over a minute\n\n### Submit your solution here", "answer": " 3"}

We will assume every pie is eaten with fork.\n\nTo reduce the amount of pies eaten with fork(1000-1000*68/100=1000*31/100), we should reduce by 68% using 1000*4/100-10-100*31, 31 means 31%(31/31). (68%-31%)(4/100)=27%*(1/100)-30%=5/100~0.5%.\n\nSince each pie is reduced by 0.5%, we reduce $2000 by $2000*0.5% = $10 which will become $1990.

{"text": "Cats weigh around 4 kg (8 lb) on average, with male cats tending to be a little heavier than females.\n\nAnne has two cats.  Anne weighs 70 kg (150 lb).\n\nShe can easily lift 120 kg (260 lb), including Anne's own body weight.  Anne is going to carry (lift) a cat (2 kg) in each arm, 36 total kg (or 79 pounds).  \n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. According to the given question, Anne's female cat weighed 2 kg. She also has a male cat, which is two times bigger. If 2 kg is a cat's weight, the male cat will then weigh 4 kg, which is twice as heavy as the female.\n2. Anne's female cat's weight is known, so it was not a question of multiplying something by 2.  It's more appropriate to ask how Anne's male cat weighs, which will lead us to the answer of 4 kg.  Anne's male cat is two times bigger, so it will weigh 8 kg.\n3. Hence, we can conclude that Anne's male cat's weight doubles the female cat's, which leads us to the answer of four kilograms.\n4. The next step is to calculate how many kilograms Anne is carrying based on the given information. Anne's female weighs 4 kg. Her male cat is twice as heavy, or 8 kg. The information provided in the question states that Anne is going to carry 2 cats, or a total of 6 kg. Anne's male cat doubles the female cat' and the two cats are going to be in Anne's arms, 6 kg, which is only half of Anne's capability of lifting 12 kg.

Choices:  Cars A: The loudest B: The hardest C: The fattest  D: The hottest E: The highest\nRationales:\n1. Dogs bark loudest of all the options presented. 2. People walking in the car park blare music, making their sounds quite loud.\n3. The cat would be the least noticeable because of its relatively quiet steps compared to the other options presented that make an abundance of noise.\n4. Cars aren't fattest, so it would be eliminated.\n5. Cars aren' t hot, hence it has to be eliminated.\n6. The dogs are heavier and their weight makes their noises louder than that of the cat.\n7.

So she would have to save around $60 during December to reach the total savings of $ 150.\n\n### Justification:\nThe answer is not A. She doesn't have to save \"ten\" because she saved ten for seven months of the year. So that would be equal to about 10 dollars a month.\n\nThe answer is not B because she does not need to save 10 plus 15. She only needs to save 10 and then save the rest to equal 70 in total.\n\nThe answer cannot be C, because if she had to save 180 dollars to equal 150 dollars, she wouldn't have saved 150 dollars. Then she would only have 30 dollars saved.\n\nThe answer can't be D, only because if she is saving 15 dollars for 3 months which total to 45 dollars. And then saving 10 dollars for 7 months which total to about 70 dollars. Then she must come out of it with a total of 115 on her savings, then subtract 135 from 115 and you will come out with 20 dollars, which she could use that money for 150 dollars for the year.\n\n### Outline:\nThe problem begins by Roe saving $10 per month. \n\nThe goal is to reach a savings of $130 during the year.\n\nThen Roe saved $15 in August to November.

An idiom is a group of words whose meaning is not obvious from the meanings of each individual word. 2. \"The answer\" is not a speech, song, poem, act, or action, so therefore B and C cannot be the answer, however A can be the answer, as sometimes people refer to saying things in general as'speech', so in this context A could be the answer.3. B and C cannot be what the idiom is referring to because'speech','song', 'poem' are not what people call 'the answer'. But again 'act' and 'action' can be called 'the answer' as in the context of the sentence it is asking one to act/do something not to tell them what to do. 4.

Then, we multiply 3 and 1 to get the equation: 3 * 1 = 3. To do that, we multiply a number by the inverse number of that same number. For example, the inverse number of 1 is 1/1 which is 1.

So that the number has to be divided by 1 (1/1) 11 = 11 (no change) 21 = 21 * 2 (double of that number) 27 = 27 * 2 (double the value) 32 = (21 + 21 + 11) / 2 = (21+11)/2 = 32, and last but not least, 66 = 23 + 23 / 2 = 23 and 23 to get 66.\n## Instruction:How many grades do you need to pass to get an associate degree?\n###", "answer": " 100"}

How many thousand is the difference between the price and the amount for the bathrooms? Choices:  -2000  -500  -15000  -4000  -25000\nRationales:1.  We are given the total price, 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a difference of -2500.\n2. We subtract 4000 or -2500 from this to make use of the -2500 clue.\n3. -2k or -2000 should have been the closest choice, but there are two other options -500 and -1500 given, thus we should check all three.\n4. Subtracting -500 from 32000 we end up with -37000, and subtracting -1500 we end up -38500, which is $38500 or -3700 short.\n5.

The question asks about memory. And if memory were good, then both options are good.\nBut if their memory was bad at all those times then we'd have to say their memory was not good.\nIf the answer were no, the question and answer would imply that memory is only good when a memory is stored.\nWhich isn't really the case since it's more about where the memory is stored, as long as it fits any definition of a good memory.\n\n### Response(Bad):\"No\"\n\n### Why?(Bad):\nIt would be weird to say one memory is good but the other isn't, right? The question is asking about memory and you can't say one type is better than the other.\nBecause the answer could then be like, \"No, the previous week's memory is not good but the 5 year memory is good.\"\nWhich would be really awkward.\n\n### Example Question:\n\"Did your brother study last week?\"\n\n### Correct Answer:\n\"Yes, he studied.\"\n\n### Reasons for Correct:\n\n- It's implied that last week's studying is supposed to be good.\n- Saying the answer is yes would mean last week's memory was good.\n- You can't say that one memory is better than the other and then make the other negative.\n- So if they say yes, then both are supposed to be good.", "answer": " 250"}

{"text": "Bella bought 10 truck stamps and 7 snowflake sticks. As for rose stitch design, she bought 9 stamps less than truck stamps, so there she has bought 2 less. So overall she bought 21 stamps.\n\n### Explanation:\nBella bought 21 starches in all. The snowflake starches are (11-9)=2. So we'll have to subtract snowflake designs from stamps she bought in all. So she bought all 21 (snowflake-2)=19 (stamps).\nThen, she bought 34 rose designs, 9 less than the truck designs. So she bought 34-2=32 (rose designs). Again we'll have to reduce these 32 for the snowflake stich designs. If she had bought 21 snowflakes in all, 3 snowflakes will subtract from 32 rose designs. So we'll deduct 3 from 32(rose) = 29.

Substitute values for x and y to find the missing value.\n\nLet x + y = 60 and $x - y = 20.\n\nThis is a system of two equations and two unknowns - a perfect scenario for substitution.\n\nSubstitute x + y = 2x + 3y = 60 for (x + y) - 2x = $20, so that you end up with only one equation.\n\n$x + y = 6.0\n$2x -2Y = 20\n\nNow, we can substitute values for x and y and solve for y to find how much more Lisa earned than Tommy.\n\nLet y (Tommy amount earned) = 30, and substitute the formula $x + y = $6.0 into the formula $2x - 2y = 20. \n\nNow, 2x can be written as x + y. \n\n$x +y = $6.0 - $2y = 4.0 - 2y\n\nCancel both $2 and $4.\n\n$x = 2.0\n$y = 20\nTherefore, x (Lisa amount earned) = 60, and y (Tommy earned amount) = 3/2 x 30\n\nHence, Lisa earned $60 - $2y, or $60 - (20/2) = $20 ($60 - $30).\n\nTo summarize, Lisa earned $20 more money than Tommy.\n\nAnswer: Lisa earned $", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "In order to find out how many hours Jerry spends watching his daughters at the field he must first understand the time commitment for each day in the season. There are 8 games in the season, and 76 hours for practice for each team. The season begins on March 28th and ends May 19th. This means the season goes for 9 weeks. There are 14 nights available to play/practice each team once each.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question first notes that there are 2 daughters but it doesn't distinguish which one plays on which team. This implies that the two daughters play on the same team. We can also use this to exclude the possibility for multiple teams playing on this one field. Additionally, the question notes that each team practices 4 hours per game. This means they practice 1/4 as long as they play. Each game lasts 2 hours, meaning that each team will practice for 1 hour per game they play in the season.\n\nGiven the two teams share 76 hours for the season, this means they will practice together 38 hours. One parent will be watching 1/3 of 38 hours or half of 19 hours. The question then asks for the total hours that Jerry spends at the field watching for the entire season. If there were 38 available hours for the teams, and Jerry spends 19 hour watching his daughters, that means that for another 19 hours will be spent watching another practice or game. These numbers combine to mean that Jerry will spend about 59 hours of the season watching his daughters.\n\n### Input:#2019-08-30T07:48:31+00:00\nI am going to be an electrician.\nWhat are watts?

When Jennifer was done with her groceries, she had (106) cans of milk. This number is too large because Mark only bought 20 can(s) of milk.\n\n4.

Because the last floor is untouchable, this would mean the number of rooms Hans could choose from is 100 - 1 = 99. If we would not pick the last floor there would be 120 * 99 * 99 = 119690 rooms but that\u2019s counting the room at the untouchable last floor and it should be counted too and therefore we minus 1 to 119689 rooms.

{"text": "If James can collect 15 gallons for each inch of rain, then the answer to the question is 135 gallons.\n\n### Rationale:\nJames was not out of water for the second day, which indicated he still retained the capacity to collect and store water. The capacity of the barrel is 3 gallons and the water he collected was 15 gallons per inch. There would be no overflow, indicating he kept the water in the barrel. The amount of gallons for the first day totaled 54 gallons (since James collected 4 more gallons than the previous amount of 52 in the second barrel, the total was 53).  If the water collection for the first day was 15 gallon, then the total number of gallons he collected for that day should be 15 \u22c5 4, or 60 gallons. By the same logic, the total amount of gallons of water he collected for Tuesday should be 60 \u22c5 3, or 180 gallons. From the question, we are told that James collected a total of 135 gallon, so the correct answer is 135 (4 \u22c5 90 + 15).\n\n### Further Processing:\nSince the first barrel was at most 3 gallons, we can use the same logic to find the total amount of gallon of rainwater collected in gallon, if all the rain is from Monday or all the rain is from Tuesday.\n\n(a) If all the rain was on Monday, then there should be 60 gallons for the first barrel, 30 gallons for the second barrel, and 15 gallons collected in total which implies the total gallons collected is 4 x 90 - 15.\n(b) If all the rain fell on Tuesday, then all the rainwater from Monday would overflow, and the total amount of rain water to collect would be 52 gallons (4 + 90), with 30 gallon collected in the first barrel and 22 gallons collected in the second barrel which will bring 90 gallons of rainwater collected in total.\n\nWe can conclude that the water James collects is about 129.9 gallons since he has", "answer": " 126"}

So, we assume that the boutique was a place where she bought things and made a lot of money, even if she was in debt.\n\nFurthermore, we know that \"fifth\" is the measurement of an event and that a unit of measurement is equal to \"0.2\" (based on \"twenty\").

The rest of those eating special diets are on gluten free diets.  20% are lactose intolerant and 15% are allergic to dairy. How many people are there in the theater with dietary restrictions?\nRationales:   1. The question contains ____% of people special dieting 2. We can subtract the number of those special dieting from the original number to get the people who are with dietary restrictions. 3. We also need to know how many of those on a special diet are on gluten free or lactose intolesting. 4. The answer should be ______  5.

Choices: 1. A: toothpick B: toothbrush C: floss D: tongue E: brush\nRationales: First, determine what dentists use on a patient's teeth.\n2. They typically use toothbrushes (option B) and floss (option D).\n3. While a toothpick (option A) or mouthwash (option C) may sometimes be used, these are only used or brush and floss. \n4. A tongue (option E) is not used by dentists, though it may be used afterward by some individuals.\n5. Therefore, the answer must be between B and D.\n6. From there, we can narrow our choices by ruling out unreasonable scenarios.\n7. For example, a toothpick cannot be used between teeth, so we eliminate A.\n8. Floss cannot be used to brush, and because it can be used on a separate or after a brush, it is less probable as the answer.\n9. Toothbrush is the most reasonable choice, which is also the answer.\nInput: The teacher asks the students to make a poster on the topic of global warming.

{"text": "The answer is B. The question above states that from March to August, Sam is able to make $460 via 23 hours of work. However, from November to February, he is only able to work for eight hours a week. The question above is trying to figure out how many more hours Sam would need to work in order to save up for his $600 video game console.\n\nDemonstration: Let's first figure out the total number of Sam's hours worked:\nDuring the months of March-August, Sam is able to work 23 hours a week. In other words, total hours from March to August: 20 weeks*23 hours = 460 hours.\nSam can only work 8 hours per week during the months of September to February. In other words, the total from September to February: 20 weeks * 8 hours\nTotal of September to February: = 160 hours\n=> Total hours worked: 460 + 160 = 620 hours\nThe question is asking how many more hours does Sam need to work in order for him to save up enough money to buy himself a video game console? Well, in order to work 620 hours, Sam had to start in March and work out for 20 straight weeks. In order to start in September then, Sam has to work out for 26 weeks - that's 20 weeks more than the 20 straight weeks he was able to work before. That's how many more weeks that Sam would need in order to be able to buy the video game console.\nAnswer: B: 26 weeks", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "$5000\n\nInput:The answer to this question is $5000. The first center processes just 1000 per day, so 1000 multiplied by 5 cents equals $50 per day. That adds up to $500 per week. The second center processes 30000 per day. If the 3000 per day is multiplied by 5 and divided by 3 (the number of times the center is able to process 3000, i.e. in a day), it will give us the value of 5 times 3000. Hence the answer is $500. Since the second center is three times more efficient than the first, the two centers combined have a volume of 1000+3000. So, 6000 multiplied with 5 gives us the weekly output as total $30000. Hence 3000 is the multiplier of output per day.  $3000 times 7 is the profit made per week at the combined centers. Hence, the answer to this question is 7 days $3000.\n\nAnswer: $500\n\n### Input How do you spell \"banana\"?\n\n### Instructions Answer the question.\n\n## A:   How do you spell \"bat\"?\n\n## Answer:   With a \u201cb\u201d\n\nInput: A bat is generally spelled with a capital \"B,\" as it's an exception to the basic rules of \"i before e except after c.\" Therefore, \"bat\" should be spelled with an initial capital.\n\n## Input How do you spell \u201cbanana\u201d?\n\n## Answer: Banana is spelled with capitals at the beginning and end, so the correct spelling is \"Banana.\"\n\n## Input How would you spell \"bat\"?

This implies that the third sentence will indicate the total number of cup[c][e][s] Robin had on her own, which is 2x2 = 4, and the relationship is 4:2 = 4:16 = 20.\n5. Hence, the number of cupcaks that Robin has eaten is 20.\n\n### Answer:\n[![input][input_pic]][input_link] [![response][response_pic]][response_link] [![demostration][demostration_pic]][demostrationlink", "answer": " 12"}

Rationale: According to the question, the answer is 48 hours. First, note that John worked 8 hours * 5 days = 40 hours. The total is 40 hours. John worked from the 3rd day to the 8th day. Hence, he worked 8 hours from the 3rd, 8th days, in total 16 hours, from the 8th to the 9th day which is 1 day.\n4. Thus the total is 48 hours, so the answer is E: 45 hours.", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "The answer to this question is Option C: 2 more presents.\nSantana clearly lives in a family with lots of birthdays and Christmas celebrations, so she spends her money pretty freely. It\u2019s clear that she buys presents for every birthday that is celebrated, and in the second half of this year alone there are 7 birthdays in March, October, and November. \n\nFor December, she would have to buy presents for the two birthdays on that month. That makes 13 birthday presents total. With Christmas around the corner, Santana would have to buy her brothers at least 2 more presents - enough to cover the two Christmas gifts.\n\n### Difficulty Level: Medium\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Let's start by listing all the choices: A, B, C, D, and E.\n2. First, Option A does not fit the criterion since birthdays in March are only mentioned twice.\n3. Option B does not fit because there are only 3 birthdays mentioned in March, and 1 in October so far, and the total number of birthdays mentioned in March is 3.\n4. Option C seems to be the answer because Santana would have to bring 2 more presents in the second half of December for all the Christmas festivities.\n5. Option D is not the answer because it would be 2 birthdays in March and 1 in October.\n6. Finally, Option E has 2 birthdays in December, making five, but Santa would need to bring 2 more so it doesn't equal 7 from the original description provided.\nAnswer: C. The total should be 13 birthdays in the first half of year and 15 birthdays in the second half of year, so Santana would need 2 additional Christmas gifts and gifts corresponding to two more people's birthday.\n\n\n### Draft Version of the Instruction: The question asks about the number of people born in each month. We can use this information to infer how many gifts Santa can buy depending on when the gift are given.

That doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.\n\nThe next two sentences explain a bit more about the name you want to give the company. You want the company name to be \"good.\" You also want the company name to indicate that the company provides \"electricity, services, and products.\"\n\nTo start, you can go through the dictionary and find a good name by looking at synonyms for the word 'electricity.' Since you're looking for \"good words\" to describe the name of the company, synonyms are your best bet.\n\nWe started by looking through a dictionary (thank god there is a good dictionary online) for the definition of electricity.\nIt's defined as lightning, rays, or waves of electrical energy. We then looked at the word it is defined from, which is electric.\n\nOur next best option for a word describing this would be the word power.

It is defined as \"lightning, rays, and waves of electrical energy.\"\n\nLooking for synonyms for 'power', we got the following dictionary definition: \"...to have great and often evil control or influence is to exert authority power...\" The key here is 'power' is defined as \"the ability to accomplish something.\" We also know about", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "1. The question asks to solve the problem with the answer being 35 hours.\n2. The rate of $45/hour has already been stated, so we will proceed by calculating the rate in order to find the total amount earned ($75)\n3. Plugging in $45/hour into the equation gives the total amount earned for 3 hours which is 45.\n4. We will need to solve the problem by dividing the total by 3 to get a rate of $15/hour.\n5. To meet the requirement of earning $75, this rate should be applied to 35 hours. \n6. To get the hours required we will multiply the rate by 35.\n7. $15/hour * 35 hours = 525\n8.

This was found by first solving the original problem with $45/hour and $3 hours to get that $45 was earned, and then solving the new problem with $15/hour and 35 hours to get $75 was earned. \n10. This reasoning is because there are an infinite number of ways to solve a problem, even with the original problem of finding how much Alani earned at $45/hour.

CeCe finds twice as many as Abe but does not find 6 ants (the number of ants together).\nTherefore, the total answers come to 4 and 36.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nEach question can have 2 options that add up to the correct answer.\nThe answer can consist of a + a - or a +/- operation.", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "A: 8.5 years\n\n### Demos:\nRationales:1. From the given information, one can infer the following:\n2. The relationship between the dog's and the fish's lifespans would be expressed as 4:2.\n3. By combining this information to relate the hamster's lifespan to the fish's, one would know that the hamster lives 6 months for every year that the fish lives.\n4. Applying this insight to the fish's livespan, one can conclude that the fish's lifespan equates to 6 months times 2 years (assuming that the fish lives an average of 2 years), which is equivalent to 12 months.\n5. 12 months times 4 (based on the dog's lifespan) equals 48 months.\n6. Dividing the fish's lifecycle by 48 based on the dog's average lifespan yields 96 months (roughly 8 years).\n7. Thus, the longest an aquarium fish could live to be considered healthy and well-cared for is 8 years.\n8. Answer: A: 8.5.\n### Input:In a 40-member jury pool, only 24 people are eligible to serve.

{"text": "#### Solution:\n\nThis task is solved by the Venn diagram method. The Venn diagram helps to compare the items between two different groups or sets.\n\nLet's begin with Anna\u2019s collection before trading. First, we create an 'Anna' circle and a 'Jeff' circle in our diagram. These two circles contain a complete set of 37 stamps taken from Anna\u2019s and Jeff's collections. Now that they\u2019ve been combined into one circle, the number of stamps in the merged circle is 66\n\nNext, we draw a circle for 'after trading.' The newly combined circle contains 47 stamps. We can compare the two circles to see how many stamps Anna trades with Jeff and Alison. By subtracting 6 stamps from Alison, we get 31 since Alison gave 6 stamps (Anna collected 37 stamps before trading, and Alison gave Anna 6 stamps, so the amount remaining is 31). Therefore Anna's collection after the swap would be 47 stamps minus 31 stamps (Anna\u2019s collection before the swap), which equals 16 stamps.\n\nAs a result, Anna's collection after trade would be 16 stamps and Alison's collection after trade is 9 stamps.\n### Instruction : The following graph shows the number of people who attend concerts each week.

Starting with 22 pieces the first calculation is that Tabitha received 'half that amount' which is 11 pieces, leaving 11 pieces for her other friend. In the next calculation, it is 'the rest', which is 11. In the end, there are three pieces of candy left over. In total they collected ___ pieces, which we can see by adding the total number of missing pieces of candy together, which is 20.\n\n### Response Explanation: The friends caught a total of 22 pieces of ___ candy each.\nDifferent from the above example, 22, we can see that the friends total is in parenthesis.\n\n### Input:\"I'm so sad. The candy at the party was gone by the time I got there, and I only got 7 pieces.  How can I get more candy?\"\n\n### Response:\"Do you still know who won?\" the candy fairy replied.  \"Then call this number and ask her.\"\n\n### Response Question: What number does candy fairy say to call to buy ___?\n\n### Rationales: The candy fairy says the person should have 7 candies and asks how they are called. Since it is the candy fairy who wants to know the name of the person who wants the amount to be called she says the number that should be called is '___'. \n\n### Rationale for response:\nThere are ___ candies to buy.\nFirst, the total number is '7' since it is the amount of candies missing. In the next part, we subtract the number of candies she initially had, which is 7 from 16, to find out that she needs 9 more candies to have the same amount as the fairy.\n\n### Restaurant Instructions: When a visitor comes to their place, they want to know if the restaurant has any free seats available.

{"text": "First identify the problem as a fraction division problem.\nSecond, determine the common term or factors between the numbers of desks in each class and the number of classrooms in the school. In this case, it is 30. \nDetermine if the answer is greater than or less than the original number of classrooms. In this case, the answer is less than the original. Therefore, a further division is needed.\nFract Division Example:\nExample:A school has 5 classrooms. The common term between the number of students in each classroom and number of books in each classroom is 10. How many books are in the school?\nTo use a long addition method, divide the numbers into a few sets and then perform a long addition to find the answer.\nFirst, divide the number of books and number of students by the common term.\n5 / 10 = 5 / 10\nFor the long addition method, the common term will be reduced or cancelled out.\nNow perform a long addition. \n5 / 1 = 4 +4 +3\n\nAnswer: There are 23 students that can sit at a desk.\n\n\n### Input\n\nA city consists of 1300 streets. 300 of these streets are paved. The rest of the streets are not paved. What fraction of the streets are paved?\nThis problem asks to find the answer for the fraction part of the question.\nFirst identify what the problem is asking.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question asks to determine what the fraction for the number of paved and non-paved streets are.\n2. It does not ask for the exact values of both numbers. Therefore, there is no need to find the exact values first. \n3. Use the strategy of 'division by a fraction or ratio'.\n4. This question can be converted to the fraction  of the streets being paved?\n5. In order to get the fraction, divide the number of paved streets by the total streets.\n    - (300 \u00f7 1300) = 0.23\n    - So, it can be written as 23% of the streets are paving.\n\n![1 1](\\images\\1-R2M4.png)\n\n### Solution:", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "The response for this question should explain how to answer it following the given request, then compute the total amount of salmon sold in two weeks, while explicitly demonstrating how the calculation was done.\n\n### Response Body:\nTo accurately answer this question, we can start with recognizing that the amount of fish sold is the primary factor that influences the sales. Therefore, we can divide the total amount of fish (50 kg) by three to get 16.67 kg of salmon sold per week. This is the only relevant piece of information in the question because of the fact that the fishmonger tripled sales the following week.\n\nNext, we multiply 16.6 kg by three to find the answer, getting a total of 50.1 kg. To clarify, 16.66666... kg is a valid approximation for 16.6 because the fishmonger sells three times more per week in the following week.\nTherefore, the amount of salmon sold by the fishmonger in two weeks (50.1 kg) is 50.1kg.\nAnswer:50.1\n\n### Input for grade math question: The referee called for a foul when one punched another.

It's given thatA can eat 12 hot wings per minute, which is almost two times as much as K can eat per minute. It's also given that Alan has a specific time to beat Kevin\u2019s new Hot Wing record.\nTo achieve his goal, Alan needs to take in 2x many hot wings and K can eat in 8 min.

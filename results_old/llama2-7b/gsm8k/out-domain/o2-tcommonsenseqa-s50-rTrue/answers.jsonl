{"text": "He ends up with 23 pieces\n\n### Rationale:\nAlbert buys two pieces small pizza, so if he buys two large pizza, he will be able to get 2x16 = 32 large pizza pieces. So to get 32 pizza pieces, he has to eat one big pizza.\nIf he ate one slice of each, he will have the same thing as eating one big pizza. So he will eat 16 slices, 8 from small and rest 16 from large pizza.\nIf Albert doesn't finish both large pizza pieces, then he ate 2 big pizza. So, the amount of large pizza he will eat is 2.\nThen He will have 36 pieces of pizza to eat in one day = 2x2x16 + (1x16)\nSolution:\n2x2+16(small) + 36(large)\n = 23\n### Instruction\nGiven a string.

This way, she knows that it will take her 20 min/2 pages per page to finish a book. Given that, she can read 120pages in two hours, since she reads 20 min page.\n\n### Input 2:\nInput: Joy goes to the library to read and has a book she wants to read today. She's been in the library for 1 hour and 10 min. Therefore, she's read 2 pages. She'll read for 25 more minutes, because she could read 20 min per book page. Since there are 5 pages left to read, she will read 20 min more pages. At the end she will read page 11.\n\nRationales:\n1. Based off of the info we gave Joy about how many she can/will read in 20 min, she can read 75 min to finish 5 pages, so she'll be done the in the next 55 min.\n2. 11 pages can be read in exactly 1 hour.\n\n### Response 2:\nResponse: 55 minutes\n\nInput: Joy could read 20 pages/min. She's been at the library/reading for 48-10 min. Since she could finish 20 pages in 20 min/10 pages in 24 min. She'll read 20 more pages.\n\nRational 1: Based off of the info from the instruction, she's read a total of 40 pages. So she will, based off of her ability to read 20 pages in one go, read 180 pages in 40 min to finish the book.\n\nRational2: Since it's been 48-13 minute, it's been an hour and 13min, which is 23 more min. The book consists of 120 pages, therefore, she'll have to read 23 more pages, which is 18 pages total in 23min.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "We can use the information that Jack needs 100 grams of salt to season 450 grams of fish (100 g / 450 g), and 20% of any solution is 20/100 = 0.2, so there is 0.2 grams of salt for every 100 ml of water. We know how much salt Jack needs and the amount of water in the bucket. We need to find the number of ml of salt in the solution if all the water evaporated. We know that there are 1000 ml in a liter so that means there are 2000 ml of salt left after all the water evaporats. Then when you take away the 0.2 gr of salt for every 0.100 ml, you have 2000 g of salt left. That means you have 0.400 L of salt, which is 400 ml.\n\n# Questions\n### Question #1\n---\n**What are the two main roles of an operating system?**\n\nThe two main roles of an Operating System are the following:\n\n1. A software layer that enables programs to run on a computer. Above the operating system (OS), programs and the end user, are at the lowest layer while hardware, such as the computer hardware itself or computer peripherals, is at the top level.\n2. Provide an interface for humans to interact with a computer.\n\n### Question #2\n\nCan a program run efficiently without an OS? Give a reason for your answer.\n\nYes, a program can run without an OS. A number of programs do so. The most efficient way to do so it would be to \"bare metal\" programming, which is programming in such a way that the processor is not interrupted at all; no calls are made for an operating system to begin doing its thing. Because of the need for a memory manager, garbage collection, and other OS services, bare metal programming is inefficient and often only applied for low-level programs like games, operating systems, and other programs.\n\nWhen dealing with multi-threaded programs, or even simple ones, programs are often written in such a way that they need an OS to function. Multi-threaded programs need the multi-threading services the OS can provide,", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "27\n### Rationales:\nFirst, we know that cubs are born at a rate of 5 per months, and that they are born on the tenth day of the month so that birthday of all cubs from a month will be on the same day.

So, the monthly loss of lions after 12 months is 12, and we know that there will be 27 lions in Londololi in 1 year. Therefore, after 12 months the number of lions is 27. We know that lions go through a process in which they grow until their birthday and reach their adult size, then die. After this process, there is no limit to the number of cubs that will be born. So the total number of lions in Londolololi must be 27.\n### Input:If $a =1.6$, $b = 3.2$ and $c = 3.4$ what is the value of $6a+4b-8c$?\n### Response:13.6\n### Rational:\nwe can divide both sides of the equation by $56$ to get $a+b-c=2.666$\nthen we add -1 to both sides to get $a+1=2.667$\nthen $a=0$ and $b=2.664$ and $c=-2.665$ then plug them in we get $6a+4bb-8cc=-13.6$\nthen to solve for $6a+4c+-4b-8c$ we add $8c$\n### Input:A man starts walking in the north-west direction at 22 km/hr.

The game is played on a court, so options could be football, basketball, golf, tennis or squash. The game is played without a football. Since it is not football, it cannot be football which rules out option A. Option B could be volleyball which is a ball sport played on a court but a different sport than football. Option C, golf uses balls but is not played on a court, thus eliminating it from the answers. Option E, volleyball, could be volleyball, but it does not have fouls, so it cannot be volleyball. The player is sent to the penalty box for fouls, so we have to figure out which of the other sports can use the penalty box. From what we know, only basketball or football can use the penalty box, so it must be football. The player went to a sin bin, which is usually used in football.

{"text": "In terms of the task, the first step is to use what is given to eliminate any impossible scenarios and determine all the necessary variables as much as possible. This means, for each given scenario, it is necessary to determine what is given for which variable and eliminate that scenario if the scenario is not possible. \n### Next, determine if we are asked to find a specific value for a given situation or to find all possible values for a specific variable under given conditions. In this example, since we do not say \"Janet has to pay 80% of her employees' wages and taxes total for one month as FICA taxes,\" there are inevitably several different wages, a different number of employees, and a different number of months. Since we are asked to find the total FICA taxes for one month, the answer we give cannot depend on any other variable; we can work only one month and only determine the FICA taxes that month. Therefore, we need to consider only one month and one set of given variables.\n\n### To determine answers for specific scenarios involving the given information, it's necessary to use what is given more than once by rearranging or reusing it, considering logical inference, etc.\n### Finally, once the solution is determined, it must be communicated in a clear manner. In this example, we use variables we created to label different things to make it clear what we are referring to.\n\n### Answer: According to the formula \"Federal Insurance Contributions Act\" for $ (salary), taxes =.1 (FICA tax). Total wages paid in one month = salary of each employee working for one month. As all employees are the same and there is no extra variable like \"per day,\" the wages do not change for any employee. Total monthly wages = sum (15)(8)(25)= $26,400. As the wages are constant, the total FICA paid out is $2,640.\n\n### The following was written on the board at the end of the lecture:\n\nTo answer 95% of the question, you must ask 95% of all the questions.

Since each day, she has 40 cookies in total, the total amount of biscuits and biscuits has also to be 40.\nThen Uki\u2019s earning in a day equals the number in the day to total for that day.  For example, her earnings on day 1 equals the difference in the number of cupcakes in her bakery and the number of cookies sold. Then the equation to her daily earnings is  \nE1 = number of cupcakes - number of cookies.  For day 2 this will be E2 = 10 - (40 - 10) = 20, which will be her earnings on the day.\nSo on day 1 her earning equals the difference in the cookies to cupcakes. So, her earnings for that day are 40-20, equal to 20. So day 1 earning must be 20.  Similarly for other days.\nNow we have to find a way to calculate the number of earnings for each item she is selling.\nTo start, we know that she will earn 124 dollars. Then the amount she earns for an item, and sells it in each day, is calculated using the formula:\n\n###\nE = $n x 1.50, for cupcake.\nE = $n.20, for cookie.\nE = $1.00, for biscuit. \n\nThen I will be able to replace the unknown n values with the day they sell, and hence find an equation I can solve.\nTo find the total number of bakery items on day 1, E1 = 0.5 n, for cupcakes. As E1 = 20 and n = 10, I can substitute them into the equation.\nE1 = $20 x n (10)= 200.\nE2 = 1.5 n (10) = 150.\nE3 = 0.5n for cupcakes and 1.5n for cookies.\nE4 = 1n for biscuits.\nE5", "answer": " 350"}

Then we can solve the first equation. Two fifths of 30=12.5. Then we can use the second method of elimination, two fifths of 12.5=  2.\nThus, there are only two unique cases where the numbers can fit the question. The first one is when two-fifths of the members ordered lemon juice, one-third of the remainder ordered mango juice and the rest ordered orange. That fits perfectly with the given numbers. The second one is when only the members ordered orange juice. If we disregard this one, the rest of the numbers can be solved using the previous equation. \n\nWe can eliminate option A, which says two-fifths orange juice, because there are only two options where the lemon juice, mango juice and orange juice can fit. It is not possible that one member ordered two-fifths mango juice while two-fifths lemons and the rest ordered orange, therefore it's one-fifth mangoes and two-fifths oranges.\n\nHence the correct answer is C, one fifth and two fifths.Answer: C: one-fifth mansgoes and two-fifith oranges\n\n### Input.The average number of chairs at a movie theater is 20.

The calculation is not part of the problem, it is an example of the verbal description.  Calculation: The question asks to find the value of x based on what is given.  This is done by first stating the calculation, then entering the answer (which is a fraction).\nExample of Calculation: 2 * 1 / 3 + 6 = ____________\nAnswers: 7/2\nInput: The problem is to find the sum of two numbers, one being positive and the second being negative.\n\nRationales: The problem asks to find the sum of 2 numbers, one of which is negative. First, we determine that A is +6 when A is positive and A is -6 when A is negative. Therefore, the problem must be A + B = ______.\n\n### Instructor response: In this problem, it's stated in plain language that the sum of two numbers has to be entered in the answer box.

The question now becomes what multiple of (1/2x) equal to (1). That would be 6/2, so (1/2 x) = 4, and the value x = 6.\n\n4. Then, the whole equation = 1/2 (6) + 1 = 9/2 + 1 = 4.5 + 1 = 5.5\n\n5.

Therefore, we have, 25+25+25, and 25+200. There is two answers that will work: 200, or 25.\n\nFor the last one, since 1/4 of the candy bars are milk chocote with almonds, we can say that 1/4 of 25, is 6, so the answer for that number is 6.\n\n### Input2: The choices for the English lesson are the following.

{"text": "The question mentions there are 4 different colors of marbles inside the box. As the question doesn't specify how many there are in each color, we can determine this from the information provided. The total number of marbles is 40 which is 3 times more than the number that is 15. Therefore there are more marbles of the red color compared to the number of marbles of each of the other colors.\n\nNow we can use information for each color to determine the sum for each color. The total of 40 marbles can be split into an equal number (8) of each colour. We have the option of using an equation to find numbers of the red marbles using the fact that we have a total of 8. A solution is:\n\n8 = 3 * (total of marbles - # of green marbles).\n\nWhich can be simplified to: 2 = 3 * (red marbles/blue marbles) which is simplified to 0.4 = 3 * 0.5 so 4.2 is equivalent to 0.8.\n\nThere are more red marbles than the number of any of the three other colors, therefore to get a total of 40 we should have 3 red marbles.\n\nTherefore the answer is c: 3.\n\n### Input : 4 + 3 + 2 - 9 = 4\n\n### Response :\nI first checked to see if the first and last number can be subtracted leaving a value of three.

{"text": "In order to see when Tony is halfway through, we must first think of things as a percentage.  For example, if a person were to drive the whole way around the world and then back to where they started, they would have driven a total of 24000 miles, which is 100% of how many miles they drive.  Therefore, when a person is halfway through doing something, they have gone a distance of 12000 miles, or 50% of the total distance.  However, if Tony needs to go to each of his locations, he must drive a different percentage per location since he is doing different things.  The groceries are the furthest, with a drive of 10 miles, and a person can always choose to drive closer to the grocer to avoid making multiple stops as Tony did. When a person stops at a supermarket, it is 100%, but when a person stops at a hair salon, it is only 15% of the total trip that they are on.  Therefore, Tony will be about 55% of the way through after he gets his groceries, because his grocery trip is 100%.\n\nThen how many miles will Tony have actually driven?  Let's try to write this proportion down:\n\nMilage Tony has left - Milage Tony needs to go\n\n- - 25% + 15% + 10% = 50%\n\n45 miles, which is 50% of 90 miles, which is the total of 10 miles of groceries, 5 miles of a haircut, and 15 miles to the doctor.

If the seat is yours, and you can take it, you should sit down on no one's lap. However, if the seat is someone else's (even if the seat is yours), you should ask someone else politely to let you sit there. If they do not let you, you may occupy another seat.

So, he made a $150 profit.\n\n### Test:How many grams equal three pounds?\n\n### Answer:\nIn math, a gram is a measure of weight. It is equal to about 0.0223 libbers. Since libbers is an old unit of weight that is obsolete, if you need to use it, you should convert it into metric units. A libbers is equal to 817.659 libras. A libra is a unit of weight that measures 12 troy ounces (about 373 g). Troy ounces differed a bit from the average ounces (about.907 troy oz), which made them especially useful for counting gold and silver, which can be found in jewelry. In any case, 817.5937 ounces equal a pound. So, if we can convert a gram into ounces, and each ounce equals 817.2599 grams, then we can convert grams into pounds using the 817.3911 gram to ounce conversion. Therefore, to answer our question, we need to divide 3 pounds by 817.4498 grams per pound. Thus, our answer equals 0.358595450788846 grams to the pound and rounds to 0.36 pounds.", "answer": " 220"}

{"text": "P=180 apples\n\n### Reason: \nPam has 18 bags. Each of her baggies has as many appless as 3 of Gerrald's baggies. If Gerrald's Baggies have 40 appies each, we can say that each baggies have 15 apples. This gives Pam 18 baggies x 15 apples each = 180 apples.\n\n### Rationale for the original question\nThe question asks how many apples Pam has if each of Gerrald'a baggies contains as many apples as three of Pam's baggies, which means that each baggie that Gerrald has contains the same number of apples that Pam has. Therefore, if Gerrald has 40 apples in each of his baggies, and he has three bags, Pam has nine bags. Therefore, Pam now has 390.\n\n\n### Reponse: P =180 apples \n\nGerald's baggies each contain 40 apples, so 40 represents the base number for the equation to use. Now to work out the number of baggies, Gerald should have 18 baggles. In other words, 40 apples divided by 3 is 12 and multiplied by 18 is 10. This means that Geralds baggies must contain 12 apples each, which means that Pam's baggpies contain 15 apples, which means that she should have 180 applies (18 baggies of 15 each).\n\n### Rationales for original question\nGeralds baggies each have 40 appiles. The question says that the base for the equation is 12 apples. So 40 apples x 15 (base) = 12 so 30 is the rest which means Geralds baggles have. Then to work out how Pam has, Gerrald has 12 apples, which means Pam has 15.\n\n### Response 1/19/2021 : P=180\n\n### Original Question\nThe answer to the question is Ger", "answer": " 1200"}

Your goal is to predict how much inventory to produce per week.  A product, the value of inventory in the supply chain decreases each day (and eventually increases as items are sold).  That is, inventory = (amount of inventory on the initial day - amount of inventory on the last day)  divided by the number of days passed.  The inventory of each product varies depending on how fast each product sells.  Each product has a different inventory velocity.  Write a program that, given an inventory velocity, will return the predicted inventory for each", "answer": " 624"}

To get the average, we will multiply each percentage by its corresponding value, and then add them together to get the average across a semester.

To resolve this, draw a diagram and list 8 cities in chronological order and you will notice that the 7 cities that are next to each other are in fact adjacent to each other.  Now, it makes no sense that city X should be adjacent to city Z but to city A instead, since there is no city A between the range of cities A, B, and C, so you need to add A.  It does not need to be in the chronological order as long as there are 7 other cities adjacent to another.

{"text": "Let A1 represent the number of coins Elsa has and A2 represent the number of coids Amalie has. \nSince the ratio is 10:5, we can conclude that A1:A2=10:5 or that A2=(10A1)/5.\nIf we let A440 be the final number of coins Elasa and Amalie share, we can simplify this to A440 / 10=(A2/5)A1. Since we are interested in the number of coins Amalie has, we can substitute A1 for A2, so that A440/10=A2/5A1.\nThen we can solve this equation for A2, by dividing by 5 on both sides, like this:  A2/5A1=(A440/115)/(A440/280). \nSubstituting back in the original variables, we get, A2=65.0003\nAnd so Amalie has been left with a total of 65.001 coins.\n\n### Input :Alien spores take 7 hours to double their numbers.

Now we have to find the quotient, which is 12. When we got -789 we didn't subtract 789 by 12 because this would be considered a dividend and the rule says to multiply it by 12 so now we multiply the dividend(789) by the 3 and we get 2466 which is closest equivalent of -775. When we got -1489, we added by the divisor which is 12 to get -1376. When  -2645 was received, we subtracted the dividend by the divisor to get -480. \n\nThe dividend has not received the divisor and then we multiply it with the number of times the divisor", "answer": " 148"}

{"text": "The answer is 25 days. \n\n### rationale (optional)\nWe know that Angie drank 3 cups of every day before buying the coffee. Therefore, Angie drank a total of 3 times 3 cups, which equals 9 cups during her prior coffee supply. We can express 9 in terms of the number of pounds: 9 pounds = 2/3 lb. Since Angie bought 3 lb. of coffee, it is enough for her prior supply of coffee and the rest of the 2/3 lb remaining. Since there are 40 cups per 1 lb. we get a ratio of 40/3. It does not make a sense for this fraction to fit in the numerator (1) and denominator (5) of the fraction, since 40 is less than 5, therefore we should change to the other denominator, making the number of cups equal 10: 3 lb. of new supply - prior supply = new supply - prior supply. 1+10 = 11. To solve the inequality, we can use integers. 10 > 5 and adding the result: 11 > 10 (one more). Therefore when 11 is divided by 10 (new numerator and denominator), 1 remains, which leads to 3+2 = 5 days left, and the fraction for the remainder (3) is 0.3.", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "250 inches\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Every hour 11 to 4, shadows at 3PM are 300 inches, noon is 0 inches, and the building is 75 feet tall.\n\nWe need to find a function in the form: f(t) = a where t = time and f = feet, which yields the answer.\n\nWe start with noon, which is zero feet of difference between the shadow and the building. In order to find the answer, we need to figure out what is happening at 3:00, since we know this is the time when the building is 300 inches taller than the shadow.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 12:59, the building is rising by 75 feet per hour, and the shadow is remaining at zero feet.\n\nThe shadow is never lower than zero feet.\n\nBut we do know that the building is rising by at least 75 feet.  So in the hour before noon, the building is at 150 feet.\n\nSo the shadow is not rising by more than 75 feet.\n\nFrom 3:00 to 3:00:59, the shadow is remaining at 150 -75 feet (since 75 feet of difference is already accounted for)\n\nFrom 3150 feet to between 3:00 and 3:0059, only 10 feet of difference can be attributed to the shadow, since 75 already accounts for the building.\n\nSo the building is at 450 feet when the shadow is 205 feet.\n\nSo 205 - 75 = 130 feet is the true rise in the height of the shadow.\n\n150 + 130 = 2800 feet is then the true rise from 12:50 to 3PM\nThe width of the building is 74 feet, so the rise is only of inches.\n\nSo 750 /12 = 62.5 inches.

In soccer, if a player goes into another player's \"zone\" area on the field, there is usually a foul that is called.\n2. In the real world, football has a lot of fouls, but not all the same types of fouls. Usually if they are calling a foul it's because someone has stepped out of bounds or into the end zone, so the answer choice C:  baseball isn't the right one.\n3.

LX (60) is not the answer, as it should follow the Roman numeral pattern of adding up the values of each digit instead of doubling the digit, LXVIII violates this pattern.\n\n4. We can eliminate IV. As a number IV can be simplified as II + II in Roman numerals, which again goes against the Roman numeral structure of adding up the digits. \n\n5. Finally we should arrive at the correct answer.

How could you find a house for under $2000, 00 while following the city's guidelines on building permits?\nInput: A building permit will cover the foundation, framing and sheetrock for a house.\nChoices: A: The sheetrock and framing only include the roof. The city's guidelins are clear about sheetrock and framing being up to $X, where $X does not equal $2000.\nRationales:\n1.  Building a house costs a lot, and therefore, framing a roof would definitely exceed $2000 even on an extremely cheap budget.\n2. In addition, sheetrocking, is a costly and difficult process, even if it is only the roof.\n3. The only way to follow the guidelines on a budget of $220000 would be to do the foundations, build the framing and then the sheetrock.\n4. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and D.\n\n5. Option B: This option is reasonable to eliminate, as it includes everything but the actual building.\n\n6.

{"text": "This question asks for the number of pages needed to buy. A book is a stack of pages, and one can think of a book like a pack of cards where each page is the card. We can apply the word problem from previously to this case study as well, where we need to choose the right answer, given the choices 'pages', which are the cards and 'books' which are the packs. Therefore, we can use the same method to solve this question. \nConsider that there are 60 packs and each pack contains 7 cards, then the number of cards per pack is 7. There are 60 pack packs in total, so the number of cards in total is 60 * 7 = 420 cards. We can't use the given option of 'pages' because it is an unspecified number. The options 'books' and 'cards' would require us to calculate the number of books and cards needed to have 420 total cards respectively. However, using the word problem we solved, we have decided that this question asks for the pages needed to buy.\n\nSo the number of pages in this scenario is just 420.

{"text": "The answer is two hundred and fifteen because the first day she lays fifty eggs.  The second year she lays 51 eggs, since she doubles. Then on the third day she lays seventy-nine eggs, since 51+50.  Finally, on the last day she lays one hundred and twenty-six eggs, since she doubles all the days of production except the second day. For those four days she lays two hundred and fifteen eggs.\n\n### Explanation: Here is what is happening on each of the four days: \n> First day - she lays fifty eggs, on a scale of one egg per minute.\n> Second day  - she lays 100 eggs, on a scale to double every two minutes.\n> Third day  - this is based on the fact that the second day the frog lays 101 eggs than the first day.

She lays seventy-eight eggs.\n> Fourth Day  - she lays one hundred twenty-six eggs, for the same reason as the third day.\n> The amount of eggs laid per day:  First day- 50  Second day - 100  Third Day - 101  Fourth day - 126  Total - 226\n\n### Input::Icebergs floated down a river one day, a 5ft by 8ft by 4ft iceberg took 6 minutes to float by.\n\n### Response::Six minutes.", "answer": " 810"}
{"text": "#### Solution: Tina sold 50 copies.\n\n### Justification:\nIn order to get a $4 profit on each book there should be a $4 purchase price ($4 x 5) minus a $1 cost (($4 - 1) x 5). From that, we find that Tina must get a total profit of $8 per book (4x5). She sells 50 books, and at $20 per sale. Then she will get an $8 profit per sale ($20 x 5). Combining the two statements gives her a profit of $400 for selling 50 books.\n\n### Additional Information\nWe can also note that each book sold made her $4 profit. Then $8x2 would make her $16, which is equal to $20 per sale, but she still has the $4 profit.\nThat $4 profit must have come from her selling 100 books total.\n\nIf we break this down to two halves at each sale, we find this: she would have to purchase 50 books, sell 50 books, make a $2 profit per sale, and keep $2 of that to get the $4 profit. If it is 10 percent profit then she would sell 100 books and then it would be $10 x 2.\n\n## Sources of Instructions\n\n- https://www.csudh.edu/sites/default/files/files/academics/arts-sciences/mathematics/mathtrans_guide/Transition-to-Mathematics_Task-Based-Instruction.pdf", "answer": " 4"}

A cashier working at a bakery is employed six times per minute while a bakery employee is employed five times per hour. 3. A cashier at a bakery gets employed one hundred times per minute while a worker at the bakery gets employed twenty times per hour. 4. A cashier with a bakery gets a job for five times per minute while a cashier at a different bakery gets employed sixty times per minute.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. If a baker bake 5 dozen cookies per hour and a casher sell 5 per hour, then the baker is employed for 5/1 of an hour while the cashier is employed for 5 per minute. So the cashier is 100 times employed per minute and the baker for 6 times per minute. \n\n2 and 3 The two tasks have nothing to do with how long they are engaged in the task, rather they have to do with how many of the other employee is employed.\n\n4.

{"text": "(7/7)*(4/3)\n\n### Demostration:\n1. First, we should understand what the question is actually asking. The question says that: \"In the baking contest three times as many people  voted for the unicorm cake compared to the winner\". Also, \"the number of voters for the dragon cakes was 25 more then the number of votes for that witch cake\".\n\n2. If we combine this we can say that \"The unicorn cake was the winner because it got the highest number of votes\".\n\n3. Now we are solving this, we need to start from where the question actually starts which means we have to start of as follows :- \"In the baking competition three times as many people...\" \n\n4. Now let us solve this problem.\n  * Total number of votes = V1 + V2 + V3 +...\n\n\nNow, when there are 7 total people and you are trying to find total number of votes there are following cases :-\n\n* You have got 6 other people \n\n* You have only 1 more person than 7\n\n* You have 7 other people\n\n* In each and every case all the combinations are equal and we can say that the answer will be equal. Let me explain it this way :- Here only the total number of votes will be decided which is in fact the same as the same total number of votes in 4th case but still it is equal to all the other cases. \nThere are 6(1/6) which is a fraction of 1/12 which is also true while there are 6(11) which is also a fraction of 11/12 but again same answer.\n\nIn short if we think all the cases separately and if we use any single person we are still getting the same answer of total votes which is 48.\n\nI hope, it will solve the problem now but still there is one more option left which is of \"There were 17 votes in total for the witch cakes and cookies\" but this is just an assumption made on behalf of the people or votes in the case of that there were 7 wich cakes and 10 cookies.

What is the probability that she will win that quarter? Answer: The probability must be greater than 0 and less than 1.\n\n### Response & Rationale\nGiven a probability that is less than 1, there is a 0% chance that penny is able to win the quarter. Given a probability that is greater than 0, there is a 100% chance that penney is able to win the coin. Therefore, if Penny is able to win her coin, the probability is 1 and she has a 100 % chance of winning.

The average of the numbers is less than 21. What are the two numbers?\n\n### Demotion:\n* The average value of the two numbers is more than the sum of the numbers, so the average value must be a fraction less than the sum value. (example: 1 and 3, sum 4, average 2/4 = 1/2 < 4)\n\n### Rationale:\n* Here, the sum of the two numbers is 43, so the average of the numbers must be less than 2,5 (since the sum is 43 and the average must be less that the sum).

This statement can be derived from the statement of \"Jake reaches Matt by 1 minute\" which implies that Jake traveled a distance of 1 mile while traveling 1 minute, which was faster than Matt.\nTo solve this question, we must find the time that it takes for Jake to reach Matt based on the given information.\n\nWe can see that when he arrives a distance of 1 minute away, Jake travels a distance of \n\n<div align=\"left\"> 5</div>\n\nwhich was when Jake was 3 seconds farther than where Matt started. \n\nSo, if it takes 1 minute for Jake to reach 1 minute away from Matt, we can deduce that it actually takes more than 1 minute for Jakes to reach Matt, simply because he traveled a greater distance when traveling for 1 minute.\n\nTherefore, the time that Jake reaches his destination can be calculated using the following formula: <br>\n\ntime(Jake)=Distance/speed\n<br>\ntime(Jake) = $5/3 = 5/3 = 1.666<br>\nwhich means that Jake reaches Matt in 1 minute and 33 seconds.\n\nFinally, if Jake turns", "answer": " 64"}

The interest will cost an additional $125.25\n  Rationales:\n  \n  Answer 1: The money she borrows will cost $1,500.\n\n### Response 1: \n\nThe interest rate isn't being applied to new money, but to the entire $25,062.50. \n\n\n### Response2:\nWe can say this interest is being paid, so we need to subtract an amount equivalent to the interest. In other words, since we\u2019ve paid $1250 in interest we\u2019ll have $23,812.50 on the other side. \n\n\nA:  The interest will cost an addition of $100.\n\nAnswer 4: \n   \nThe interest is being paid so the amount on the other \n\nI can't find where they show it like that \n\n### Response\n1. Answer 4\n2. Answer 2\n\n### Feedback:\nThanks for answering. \n\nYou\u2019re right that money is $23,612.50 and that $1292.50 is equivalent to the interest rate of 7%; but you can also use the fraction `25000/1250 = 20`.\n\nA: Interest will cost an additional of $100\n\nB: 25000+ (-1292.49) + 1099.50 = 24499.49\n\nC: 161+ 1099 = 1260", "answer": " 14"}

There are 5280 feet per mile (miles / feet). Therefore, there are 528,000 feet per miles per hour. If we multiply 1 miles per hour by 528, 000 it will be equal to 528, OOO minutes an hour. That is how you convert miles per hour to a minute.\n* Now we need to convert her bike's speed per hour to minutes. It is 20 miles per inch/mph). Therefore 1, mile/mph = 12 min /hour. Yolanda goes at 12 minutes an hour.\n* Her husband was 15 minutes late at first so if this problem is 15 minutes earlier so multiply her 15 minutes late by 10 minutes an hour (15 min/hr x 10 hr / min) it will be 150 minutes.\n* Her husband drives at 40 mi/h.\n* Her husband goes at 40 miles/hour so multiply 1, miles/hr by 40 hr/miles it will be 40 min/miles.

{"text": "40 babies\n\n### Explain:\nThis problem uses an approach that is very popular in competitive programming, which essentially involves breaking down a problem into smaller problems, and implementing some type of looping logic to calculate the total solution.\n\nThe logic for this question is pretty intuitive- we ask how many pandas they would need to breed, to get 1 baby. If you've memorized the pattern, you'll know that 1/3 of 16 = 5 so that's how many breeding pairs are required to reproduce the desired number of pandas. 25% of 16 pandas is 4, which is how many pandas are required in reproduction. Multiply this figure by 2 (the number of pandas they have after reproducing), and we reach the total number of babies.\n\n#### The pattern:\n \nIf they have 4 panda couples, each coupling will produce one baby. That means we have 4 babies. (1/4 is 1/4, remember?)\n\nNow if they have 5 panda couples, then we add 1 more baby. So 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nIf they have 8 panda couples, we add 3 babies to get 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nIf they had 16 pandas, each coupling would have to give birth to 4 babies, to produce only 1 baby. The reason our formula works for each of these cases, and many many others, is because of a pattern called \"recursion\". To break it down (and the definition may vary, but this is how I learned the term), it is a procedure of problem solving in which you are given a number, or series of numbers (a function if you will) and you ask the function \"What's my next number?\", and it replies with the answer. It then tells you \"What's your next number?\", and asks \"What's your answer?\" It then calculates the answer for itself, without relying on you, and it can keep repeating until it has solved the problem or the computation gets to a point of no return by making a mathematical error.\n\nWith all this in mind, the formula for how many panda bubs you end up with is 5(1 + (n-1))", "answer": " 2"}

According to the rules of normal sampling, the population of cows needs to be considered at least 12.

With a sample standard deviation of at least three units, we can't be sure there aren't 23 cows. We'll add one to err on the side of caution, and arrive at at least 24.\n3.

Since we are given the amount of coffee cupped brewed in one day, which is 10+12, and the amount of days in one week, which is 5, we can multiply 10+10+12 by 5 to find the total amount of coffee cups in one week. 5 times 10 added 5 times 12 is 5 times 17 or 85, which is 85 coffee cups.\n\nAnswer: 85 coffee cuips\n\n### Input : Which two lines are parallel?

The flagpole breaks by collapsing on itself, so that instead of the tip being dangling, it is dangling 12 feet below the ground.\n\nThe correct answer will be 2 feet - we must calculate how many feet were dangling, by taking the difference between 2 and the distance from the flagpole base to the tip. Since we know the height of the old flagpole and we know the distance from the tip of the flag pole to the ground, we can calculate the total height in inches and divide by 12 (since the flagpole was 12 feet in height.)\n\nAnswer:\n12 feet minus 2 feet = 10 feet\nMultiply 10 by 12 = 120 inches\nSubtract 2 from the top, and 120 from the bottom: 120 - 12 = 98\" = 98 inches.\n\n### Input\n\nA woman has one-tenth of a pound of ground beef.

If a 10% discount, $80, was taken away from $80, the remainder would be $70. However, if a 15% discount were taken away from $81.1, the remainder would be less than $70 at $69.30.

It would be Sun-Wed. If she didn't work on Fridays for the six days out of seven, she would have a weekend each week, but it wasn't mentioned that. So subtract an extra weekend time per week.\n2. She also works most of the weekends, because it was mentioned, so calculate the percentage of times she worked on Fridays and the percentage of times she actually had Fridays for herself.\n4. Calculate the times she actually works on Fridays.\n\n### Calculation:15/12 * 100% = 12%, therefore 88% of Fridays she doesn't have to work.\n15/12 = 33%, therefore every three Fridays she works, and in a years time she would work 10.5 Fridays. Since this is 24/7, times 7, then that gives us 168 working Fridays. On those days she doesn't work, she had a total of (168/7) * 8 = 28 working weekends, 52 not working weekends.

{"text": "The fishmonger sold a total of 160 Kg over two weeks. Rationale: We can deduce 2 things:\n\n1. The monger sold 5 times more fish in the second week, because he sold a total of 50 times less fish in the second week. Note that we can also find: Total kg sold in second week / Total kg sold in first week = 5\n\n2. The fishmonger then sold 3 times less fish in the first week than in the second week. This leads to the statement: Total kg sold in first month / Total kg sold in second month = 1.\nA) From statement 1 and 2, total kg sold in first month = 5kg, and second month = 16kg.\nSo, total kg sold over two weeks = 160kg.\n\n### Input- How many times have you failed your tests?\n```\nA: 1\nB: 2\nC: 3\nD: 4\nE: 5\n```\n\n### Response- I failed my tests 2 times so far when I didn't study, so A must be the answer.\n```\nThere is an obvious choice, which is not B or C. That is D. We know D has failed his tests 4 times, so D is out. (This is the only answer where D is explicitly stated, so it's very easy to pick for this type of question).\n\nWe also need a total of tests. The choices are 1) the number of failed tests, 2) total tests with at least 1 failure, 3) total tests with at total of failed tests, and 4) totaltests. Let X= total tests and X=X-1=total tests-1. We can also see the number of failed tests is only 1 (i.e. 1 is a single term), thus: 1=X-1 = X and we can eliminate 4.\n\nTherefore, for 1) failed tests, we know D will work. And there's another fact: if our final total is 2, the one who has to fail twice, will be D, as D has to fail 4 times and C has to fail 3 times.

{"text": "In the beginning of the problem, Ken added enough jelly beans and brownies to make the weight triple, but he added even more jelly beans than the brownies added. This makes the problem easier. It is safe to assume that the box of jelly beans has a higher density than the box of brownies, for the same reason.\nThe problem gives two pieces of information, and no hints about what data was given, and no way to guess at what data was given, which complicates things enough that this problem becomes very difficult. But now we have established that (a) the density of jelly beans is greater than that of the brownies, (b) the jelly beans were introduced in the beginning of the process, (c) they are already at the starting weight, (d) the brownies, on the other hand, are only introduced towards the end and so require that their density be added.\nThe volume of the box will be equal to the total weight divided by the average density of the different items. After the initial jelly beans and brownie addition, this will be 2 + 3 = 5 lb / (2 / 3 lb) = 5 lb / 2 = 2.5 lb volume. Therefore the final volume will be the volume of the box of jellybeans multiplied by the ratio of brownies to jellybeans.\nThe brownies add a density of 3 lb /3 lb, so the added weight will be 3X2, which is 3 X 4 = 12 lb. Therefore the volume of the box will then be 2.5 X 12 = 30 lb + 30 = 60 lb.\nAnswer: 60 lb", "answer": " 16"}

Perhaps there's a measurement by the pound. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated. So we have 12 mangoes for each kilogram.\n* Option B doesn't work: If this was 6.0 mangoes for each kg. there we would only have 60-20 = 40 mangoes total for this choice.\n\nThis leaves 3 choices:\n\n* Option C: 30 mangoes each kg. = 180 mangoes in total left.\n* Option D: 4 mangoes each kg = 240 mangoes in the total left.\n*Option E: 480 mangoes left in total.\nEach of these is a possibility, so we need more information.\n\n### Focus the Problem\n\nFocus your problem to help you solve it.\n\n* How many mangoes are still left? 180 is less than 200 and 240 is less than 300. This means Colby still has some mangoes.\n* What is the relationship between how many mangoes Colby had and how many he sold, so he still has some? He has fewer mangoes in his possession because he sold more than he has left.\n\n### Ask How You Know it's Correct\n\nAsk yourself how you know it's correct.\n\nLet's look at C. When there are 4 mangoes available per kilogram, if there are 40 kilograms remaining there are 4 * 40 = 160 mangoes left.\n\nNow let's look at D.

A bag of apples cost the same as mangoes. 300 bananas cost the same as 800 mangos. How much does a bag of bananas cost?\n\n### Answer:We can start by finding the cost of 300 banana. Banana is half the cost of the orange, and oranges are twice as much as mangos. So 300 bananan are half the price of 600 oranges and 600 oragns are twice the price of 200 mangos. So 600 oranages are 16 times as much as 200 mangnoas. So 30o bananas are 16/2times 200 manganas, equaling 187 manganas. The same 187 manganasa cost 187 multiplied by 5,which is equal to 985. Now 300 banans in 300 bannas multiplied by 800 which would be 240,000. Now subtracing our first result, which is 985, we see that the cost of 360 bananas is 1799995. Now we add up the sum of costs from every other group. The cost of oranges is 4399990, apples 1800000, 200 mangoes 6700000. So all togethers, the total cost of all the fruit, with some small remainder, is equal to 19000959. So the cost of a bag of bananas is 1900959 less 17", "answer": " 11"}

{"text": "Asked for an explanation:\nAn explanation of my thought process\n\nInput: A store owner buys clothes for 80% of his retail price and then sells them to customers at 100% of his retial price.\n\nI want to solve for the wholesale price.\n\nI start by using the fact that the retail price is 120% of the wholesale price, with an equation for the retail price as R : W.\n\nUsing this equation, I know that the wholesale price is a percent decrease from the retail price. If W is 80% of R, that means that R must be 125%.\n\nI then subtract R from 125% to solve for W.\nTo do this, you subtract R+2x from W in the equation I have, so (R+2x) - (R+2).\n\nI solve to get W = 75%\nNext, I use this information to plug in the wholesale price into the formula for retail price of (R : W) to find the retail price.\nI have R = 100% (wholesale price) + 12.5%, so I have R= 100% +12.5.\n\nI substitute this information into my equation R : W.\nI have R:W = 100:W, which means that w = 12.5%.\n\nThis is a retail price of 100% is increased by 12.5% to 112.5%\n\nAnswer: Wholesale price = 120%\nWholesale price - 80% = 40%\nThis 40% is a fraction of the retail price, so 40% of 100 = 60%\nThe wholesale price is then 60%\n\nAsked for a revision:\nI see that my explanation does not answer the question.\n\nIt looks as though the question asked for wholesale rather than retail price.\n\nI believe I have found a suitable explanation of the question:\nMy understanding of the question is essentially that the retail price of a product is given as R : W, where R is 120%.", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "Kelcie has read ${1/4} of the total number of books that Megan read. This means that Megan has read ${4\\over5} - {2\\over5}\\times(${9\\over2}$. This is equivalent to simply replacing the fraction with \\$\\$\\, which results in $\\$. Thus, the total number of books Megan, Kelcie and Greg read is equal to $\\$.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe first part states that Kelcie has read $\\$4\\over5$ of the total number of Megan's books. In order to cancel the fractions with Megan's book count, we take the reciprocal of Kelcie's book count. Therefore her total books read is ${4\\over5}$ of Megan's count.\n\nWhen Kelcie's books count is replaced with a fraction, we have ${4\\over5}\\times$\\$$\\$. We cancel the fraction with \\$\\$, resulting in \\$\\$.\n\nThe third part of the statement indicates that Greg read $\\$9\\over2$ books more than twice the books that Kelcie read. Note that Kelcie's books are equivalent to ${4\\over5}$. Therefore we can say that Greg read ${1\\over2}$ of the total number of Kelcie's books. Hence we know that Megan and Greg read a total of $\\$3\\over 2$ Kelcie's books, adding up to ${4\\over 5}\\times$\\$3\\over2$\\$: $7\\over2$ Kelcie' s books.\n\nLastly, to collect all of the information about all three parties, add them up. Since, Megan read ${4\\over 2}x3\\over 2<${K\\over 5}{3\\over 2}$, we know that Megan read a total of $<\\$4.5$\\$, which has been collected to ${4\\over2}7\\over 2<\\$11$.\n\nTo complete the equation we must know how many books Greg read. Using similar method we can say that Greg has read \\$\\sqrt2$ of Kelcie's three of her books, adding another \\$\\sqrt2$ to the number Megan and Greg has read. Combining this with Megan's, we must know that Greg and Megan read a total number of $<\\", "answer": " 65"}

To find the relationship between Pi and the radius or diameter of the circle, you can use the formula for Pi, which is Pi is equal to four at the squares of the radius. Using this formula, let's find the relationship between Pi, the radius, r, and the diameter of the circle. Pi is equal to r to the squares times four.\nFirst, let's substitute r for both values because Pi is used only once. In this case, Pi is equal to r squared.\nTo find the relationship between a radius and diameter, you must take the value of Pi and divide it by two. Doing this, it is clear that Pi is defined by the relationship between a radius or a diameter of a circle.\n\n### Rationale 2: Pi's value is not the same in radians and degrees.\n\n## Rationale 2: The value of pi is different in radians and degrees, this means that there cannot be a defined relationship between pi and the radius as its defined between pi and a diameter.\n```\n  The reason is that", "answer": " 4"}

The project received bipartisan support from California state Sen. Nancy Skinner, and the county approved a new regulation allowing drone use. However, the proposal was still subject to public debate.\n\nWhat are the issues with drones? Who benefits from drone governance? Explain.\n\nThe use of drones to track wild animals poses several issues with drone governance. One issue is the potential privacy violations that can occur with the use of drones, as they can be used to gather information about individuals or groups of people without their knowledge or consent. This can lead to concerns about the potential misuse of this information, such as possible targeting or profiling based on the nature of the activity being monitored. Additionally, drones can present a potential safety risk, as they can potentially cause accidents or harm to people or property. Finally, the use of dronesto track animals in forests can pose threats to the environment if the drones disturb the habitat of the animal being tracked or the habitat of other animals that may be affected by the drone's presence. Overall, the use of ddrnons in wildlife tracking programs creates ethical concerns about how this type of surveillance is being used and the potential impacts it could have on individuals, society, and the environment.\n\n### Clean Energy\n\nIn the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, many industries are transitioning to a more sustainable working mode.

The equation for this was based on the distances:\n\n| |1000|\n---|---|---\n|-|2000|\n\nTo solve for Velma's distance, divide Veronica's distance by 100 and multiply by 2,000 to get the following formula, 2000/100x1000.

As a result, four meters of fence are required.\n\n![](../assets/images/feb_2020_programming/instruction_0.png)\n\nHere is a short explanation on how to solve this specific question.\n\nWe need to express each side of the flower bed in terms of the width first.\n\nHere, the width (w) is equal to the length minus 1.\n\nThe length (l) is 1 meter longer than twice the width.\n\nThis means we need 2 w and then l \u2013 2w to get the length in terms of width.\n\nWe substitute the width into each of these terms to get our final answer.\n\nWe get 2w, so 2 times w equals 2w.\n\nThis leaves us 2 w \u00d7 (l \u2013 2w), giving us 4w (l \u2013 2x w).\n\nThe total length (l) is therefore 1 meter more than times the width two times the width more. This gives a total length of 1 w (l \u2013 2 w) or 1 w (w + 1), which can be simplified further as 1 w + w.\n\nThe width of the flower bed is 4 (w + 1) or 4 (3 + 1), which simplifies to 4 (4) or 4 \u00d7 4, which is 16 meters.

{"text": "Input: Stephanie is decorating 55 cupcakes for a party where each cupcake will have either a single candle or two candles.  There are 30 candles total.  How many additional candles, if any, should she get to reach 55 candles?\n\nInput: First, let's figure out how many cups she could decorate with 1 candle and how many with 2 candles given the 30 candles she currently has.\n\nTo do this, we'll have to subtract 1 from 30. So the total number of 1-candles is 30 - 1 = 29. The 2-candle total is 30 - (2-1) = 32.\n\nNow let's find out how many 1-candle cupcakes she could decorate. The total is 55 - (30 - 1) = 25. And the same can be found for the 2-candles: the total is 55- (30 - (2 -1)) = 41.\n\nSince there are currently 30 candles, Stephanie doesn't even need to get any more candles. She already has the number that she needs to decorate all the cupcakes.\n\n### Answer(s):\nInput: Stephanie needs additional 63 to decorate 55 cupcaks.\nInput: 55 candles = 1 x [24] + 2 x [12] and is 31 short in total.\nInput: If you have a total of '31' candles and need 54 candles, you need 54 - 31 = 23 candles.\n\n---\n\n## Tips:\n\nThis page is an input-output question type, similar to the 'Multiple Choice' and 'Matching' question types. \n\nTo prepare a task for the question type, follow these instructions:\n\n* Create a task with the input text box. \n\n![](./images/Q4.gif)\n\n* Save it in the question asset store.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input\nInput:A: How many times will I be paged? Choices:  B: zero C: 1 D: Two E: 3\nRationale: 1. Option A: How many times will be paged? refers to the number of times that the phone call will be answered, not the total numbers of phone calls. Since there is only one pager, the caller would only need to be paged one time.\n\n2. Option: B could be considered an answer since it indicates that the pager would not be used at all, but this is unfeasible.\n\n3. We can eliminate Option: D: Two, based on the same reasoning we used to eliminate Option: B. If there is only one paging device, then it is impossible to page twice.\n\n4. Option: E: 3 is a much better answer since it indicates that there would be at least three phone calls. Based on the scenario, this is most likely since the patient does not have a family member or guardian, and the doctor is most likely giving his secretary the message because she usually has more authority than a nurse or other staff.

{"text": "A: 8 miles \n\n### Rationale:Tom's swim took the first 2 hours, during which time he moved at 2 miles per hour, so he would traveled 2 miles. After 2 hours, he began to run, and Tom ran at a speed of four times his normal speed-- meaning he ran at 4 miles per hour.  Since Tom ran for half the time, he ran for 1 hour.  This means Tom moved 1 mile in the first hour and an additional 3 miles while swimming.  When you add the number of miles he moved in one hour, you get a total of 4 miles. And that was for the first half hour. When you add 4 miles for the first hour and an hour, two times 5, twice, you get 8 miles.\n\n### Input 1: The referee called an out when the ball entered the foul area.

How many students are there?\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe first rule is that students are not in the equation: the equation should be `sum(x) = 100`.\n\nThe second rule is that each number must be assigned an integer value: there should be no fraction to the right of the equal sign.\n\nThe third rule is that the numbers in the equation should total to a definite number with no fraction to the left of the equal sign. For example, `3+2=5`, or `4*3=12`.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe number of students is 36. \n\nThe number of numbers in the equation is 14. Therefore, by `3*14`, there is enough information to calculate every student grade.\n\nThe three rules are satisfied because there are integers everywhere, and the 30 and 70 in the last line do not include fractions.\n\n### Input3:\n\nA number is called a _composite_ if it is not prime.

This is because they didn't think that the person that worked at the front desk was their own teacher.\n\n2. Choice B: They would most likely think about the lack of security in the school, because the front desk person is not a teacher and the security isn't guarded or monitored. This could prove dangerous considering the fact that a student could easily enter the building, which is in fact what happens in this instance.\n\n3. Choice D: This is not correct. The person does not pass through.\n\n4. Choice C: This is incorrect because the person thinks of and considers the qualifications of the front desk employee. This is not what they're thinking, the front desk person didn't even introduce themself or why they were there.\n\n5.

It is not correct to say to make a topping list, the items in the bagel, cheese and sour cream are already toppings and do not need to be added to the list, only the rest of the items (ketchup, cream cheese).\n2. It is not correct for a bagel to have toppings if they already have cheese and sourcream. If we use the wording \"the rest of the toppings\" we just have to decide what the rest needs to be.  The rest of the items could be bread, meat, olives, lettuce etc. So the only topping to be decided is something else if there already is a bagel.\n3.

{"text": "The temperature will decrease 12 degrees over one hour\n\n### Reason:We need to solve for T(0) - T(1). T(0) must be 84 degrees, per the question. Next, we know the temperature change is decreased by 12 degrees, per the question as well. Therefore, the formula for change in temperature will be:\n\nT(1) - T(0) = \\({12 \\over 100}\\times 84\\)\n\nSubstituting in the variables, T(1) - T (0) equals 12 divided by 100 times 84, or 12 divided by a hundred times 84 equals 12. Since 12 is always a number less than 1, we know the temperature must decrease by at least 12 degrees. The question itself says the temperature will decrease by \"3/4 of its temperature\" which is not explicitly stated, but it can be assumed that when they say half of its temperature what they actually mean is one quarter of the temperature. The question implies this as the term half is always used to mean three quarters, or half the whole.\n\n### Author:Jasper Jones", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "Answer: the number of cups needed for flour is = 4 times the number of cups she needs for water\n\n### Demostration with images:\nI. Kimber needs to find the combined total number of teaspoons of pizza. It is the number of cups for water + the number of cups in her flour + the number of teaspoon of salt in a cup.\n\nII. If there were 10 teaspoons of flour in Kimber's salt, he must have used a cup of salt. So the number of cups that used flour = 4\n\nIII.

Finally, the number of plates of spaghetti is equal to 2.7 * 1 = 2.7, so the fourth friend will pay $27. 5.\tThe way to solve it is first to do the multiplication of the total price by 1, then we can sub for it in case the total is already greater than a person's percentage, and then finally multiply by the total percentage. That's why in some of the calculations it was 2.7 instead of.7. I had to do that to make sure that I would still pay 50% if it wasn't already part of the total. 6.

If we were to use the formula for linear equations, which is `y=k (9x-x)+b`, `k` would be 4, so `y=4 (9 x-x)+ben` Now the total number of shells collected by ben and alan is `K+b` So `laurie= 36`\nWe can easily solve the for Ben and Alan's equation: `36=(4(9 x-x)+b)` For Ben, substitute b for 10, that will solve the equation, `10=36-(9 x-x)` Which equals 0, thus, Ben has collected 36=18.

{"text": "10\n\nInput: 7 days, 4 people, 14 oversize beach towels per washer, 14 ovensize beach towels.\n\nTherefore the number of oversized towels washed is 28/day. 14 divided by 28 is a fraction of 1/0.5, 1/5, or 0.2, because there were 14/1/2 = 7 washes for each person. That is, for people 1-4: 1, 2, 3, or 4 washes. We can see that there are 4 people, each having 3 4/7 = 0.5857 or 0.6 washes each day.\n\nHowever, it would go over if 3 families of 2 people split a vacation rental.  If we split 4 people in every family and only had 3 oversized beach tows for every 13 people, that is 3 divided by 13 is 0.23, or 1 wash per day, if there were no overloads. Here, there are more people than overloads, so 4 times 3 = 12 over loads of about 14 overside beach tows each. If there are 10+4 * 3 = 28 overloads every day, it will run out and 10 will be the final number of loads.\n\n**Additionally, in the example, I did not use the total number of towels (108) because I knew the answer was 4/0.2 = 20 and therefore assumed it was more than 10. If I were \nto use the total number of loads (108), then my reasoning becomes:**\n\nThere are 10 loads in the total, 96 towels divided by 10 = about 9, or 7 washes. Therefore people 1-4 can divide them to use 0.583 or 0.75 each day. This means there are 4 people.\n\nThere is an unspoken implication: 4 families = 12 people = 12.12 divdided by 10 = 1.21 loads of tow", "answer": " 6"}

What person is Glen?\n\n### Outputs:\nJoel.\n\n### Process:\nThe logic of the problem is to follow the path on the genealogical tree to the root of the tree. In this problem, our start point is given as a person whose cousin is Glen. Our first step is to find out who is our second generation relative as we know the first name. If the answer is a boy we follow it to it's sister's husband as the 8th brother of the woman and repeat that. When both are gone, we follow that step again (now 9th) until you go through the whole tree and reach Joseph.\n\n### Explanation:\nGlen, is the third cousin of Joel, therefore, Glen is Joel. Joel has a second cousin named Jack whose 8th brother's sister is Jane who is Joel's second sister.

So we will say that the long side is three times the length of a short side. From this, we can conclude that the long side = 3x short side. Therefore, we will say that the length of the long side = L.\n\nFurther, we can conclude from the problem that the total length of all sides of the fence = L + 3L + 640 feet. This means that the total number of feet on all the sides of the chain-link fence = L +3L + 680 feet. This will give us a two-digit number. This two-digit number will be the total number of feet contained in the fence. When dividing a two-digit number by three (which is the number of times L, the long side, must be multiplied by in order to get all of the short sides), we can get the number 640, which is the total length of the plot.\n\nWe will do this division with the following method:\n\n[Total Number of feet on the fence] \u00f7 [number of times we must multiply L by to get all short sides] = 640\n\nThe total number of feet on the fencing that we will need to replace = 640 \u00f7 3\n\nTherefore, we will use 216 to divide into our two-digit number, which will give us 150.\n\nThe number of feet, we will need to replace is 150. \n\nAnswer: D: 343 feet.", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "1.\nIn order to know which students have not read any novels, we need to understand what it means to read a novel. Doing so would enable us to eliminate students who have read some novels, or students who have read none at all.\nIn this context, a novel is a book longer than 2000 words, and written and published as fiction. Novels are often considered to be more difficult and more challenging than shorter books, and are usually read more for entertainment than for education (unless they are assigned reading material in school).\n\nWith this definition we can determine each student's status:  No students read 0 novels, because there are no novels shorter than 2001 words, so all students have read at least one novel.\n\n1/6 of students (17.5%) read three or more novellas, 35% read two novels, and 5/12 (41.7%) read one novel, leaving the remaining 26.8% of students to fall into their own category.\n\n2. \n26.8% remain.\n26.8/100 * 96 = 25.99% of all students. 26.8/50 * 100 = 92.2% of all students.\n\n### Output:\n25.99 of the 96 sixth graders read no books, according to the definition given in the prompt.

The word **percent** means 1/100, or a portion of 100 for example. **78** percent of 100 is 78/100 * 100 = 78. **78%** is the same as the number **78**.\n2. **22%** * 100 would produce **22**, however, **78%** * 150,000 would produce **150**. The **22%** is subtracted from the **78%** to produce the number **150", "answer": " 46"}
{"text": "Money gained 8/10 more\n\n### Rationale: First, we are provided with the fact that Mike earned 10x more money five months ago than Fred. So we know the amount of Mike's salary was 10 times greater than 10 times greater Fred's salary, that is, 110 times greater Fred\u2019s salary.\n\nNext, we are told that Mike's salary has been increased by 40%. Since we cannot subtract this percentage from a number and get a result that is lower than two decimal points, we know Mike's new salary is greater than his original salary by 40%. That is, Mike\u2019s salary is larger than 110 times Fred\u2019s salary by 44.44% which rounds to 45% and hence his salary is 165% of Fred's.\n\nFinally, we know Fred's salary has also been increased by 4% because salaries generally rise over time for both people. If this happened five months ago, then Fred's salary was also 110 times great his salary, so multiply 110 by 1.04 to get 114 and add the 4/10 which is 22 times to get 136. His new salary is 136 times his original salary which rounds down to 135 times his original salary. This is 44.4% greater than his original which rounds to 50%. So then multiply by Fred's original income 10 times one hundred which is 1000 then subtract 50% so that we know what 50% means for Fred's income which is 500. Mike's income is then 2150.\n\nAnswer: Money Gained 50% = (40% / 2) = 20%. Mike's Income = 2x 1.20 = 2.4 = 2400\n\n### Instructions: In what order are these values sorted?

Instead, they are equivalent to 12 divided by 4 which is 3.\n\nThe division is also not correct as all numerators are different and do not represent an exact number of eggs. Therefore one of the options has to be incorrect and so is E: 42 eggs.\n\nNext, another division that does not fit the question is 6,2 and 0 which is equivalent to 12/3.

They made a nest of 6 berries.  What fraction did each cat eat?  Choices: A: one-ninth B: one fourth C: one-fifteenth D:one tenth E: one third\n\n### Rationale:   Cats can eat at least one berry each, but each cat can eat less than a berry. Let us see how the division changes according to different numbers.\n\n* Example 1: Suppose there were a total of 6 berries, and each cat ate only one-fourth of it. => 1st cat = 3rd cat = 1/16 * 6 = 0.06. The answer is correct.\n* Example 2:  Suppose there were 9 total berries.  Each cat ate 1/9th of it = 1/36th.  Therefore each cat's answer is 0.03, which is not correct. That's because while each cat can eat at max 1 berry, they will eat more than 1 berry each.\n* Example 3: Suppose there were total of 12 berries. Each cat ate 0.25, which also equals to 1/4.   Answer incorrect.\n* Example 4: Suppose there were 24 berries. Each cat could only eat 1 berry each, which is 0.047 because each fraction is converted into decimals. Answer still incorrect because it's lesser than 1/3.\n\nHence the answer must be E: one-third. Cats have eaten 1/", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "This exercise is a good example of a combinatorial puzzle, for which a combination of disjoint sets is counted to answer a question. This question requires one to answer the question: How many cards will be in the final deck, using the initial deck of 3 full and 3 half empty cards.\n\nNote: John is the 'owner' or the 'taker' of the final deck, so it is only correct to count the number of cards that he receives. Therefore, 3 cards are deducted from the answer.\nThus, John initially has 164 cards.\n\nThe problem:\nGiven a final deck size of 52, and an initial deck size of 3x2 = 6 cards, we need to calculate how many cards are needed to make a deck of 52 cards.\n\nThis can be done using binary arithmetic.\n\nSince there are 10 possible choices of cards to add, we can do this as the following table. If A represents the number of choices of adding, for example A:1 52:1 means that one is allowed to use the only choice of the 52 possible cards that are available.\n\n\n|      |      2^8     |      52   |   2^7     |      2^6    |      2^5  |      2^2  |      2^1  |\n|:----|:------------:|:----------:|:--------:|:----------:||:--------:|:--------: |:------:|\n|   A | 32768 options | 999,999   | 256      |  65,536  ||   128    |  16,384  |  4,096   |  1   |\n\nNote: The table provides all of the combinations and permutations of cards in binary.\n\nWe note that the only thing that changes when the number of possible choices (options), changes is the number of 1s.\n\n\nThus, the number of choices of cards that will make 52, is just 0 01 10 11.\nThis is binary of 5 (which is 101010).\n\n0 01 00 11 110 10", "answer": " 200"}

This table has John's initial spending (his initial cost in dollars) across the top and the percentage insured by the insurance company in the appropriate column. In the \"pay out of pocket\" column we fill in the amount that John now owes.\n\n\n| initial spending | percentage insured by insurance company | John now pays |\n|:---------:|:---------: |:---------:|\n| $2500 | $2000 | $500 |\n| $25,000 | $21,000 | $-4,000 | \n\nThe final solution ends up being $-4,00 ($1000) because the final dollar amount that John has to pay comes from the \"pay out of your own pocket\" column.

{"text": "In order to calculate the total number of items she would have if she currently has sixty marbles, we need to first find out how many items she currently has, given that she has two times as many of one item and 20 more of another. We know the items have to add up to 60, so we can use that and solve for each possible item. The most likely item given the clues is frisbees since frisbees are given 20 more times than marbles, and if she has 2/5 times as many of each item, she is more likely to buy frisbees, giving her a total of 60, which is one more than the number of marbles. We can use that information to find out each item, but to do so we must also solve for the possible items we might get and the possible amount we might be buying. We can see that by solving for each item we find 70x, and that the item we are buying more should be 2/5 more. When we combine those clues, we find that we're probably buying frisbees and adding marbles, since they add up to 61, less than our total amount given to us.

Then we get the price difference($0.08). \n### Answer: $.47*9 = $.40, $4.00-$$.40=$0.60, $0.60/10=$0.06\n\n### Input Is: What is 8 divided by seven?\n\n### Demostration Is: 8 is divided by 7 with a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1\n\n### Input Does : Is 69 divided by 8?\n\n### Demo: 69 divided by  8  gives us a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 0. \nThe remainder is 0, so it means that the remainder is 0(nothing).\n### The Input is: What is 9 plus 55 over 7?\n\n### The Demo is: 9 added to 55 divided by 7 equals 44.\n\n### The Interpretation is: the remainder is 44(nine plus 55 over seven). \n\n### The Explanation is: The solution is four four and is a rest.", "answer": " 204"}

We are asked about each bag of potatoes individually, and are given the mass of each bag.\nWe are also asked about the total amount of bags, as well as their combined weight, which we can use to calculate the total amount of potato.\nNext, we can divide the mass of 46 kg by 3 to work out the total mass of the potatoes.

{"text": "The answer is 123, since 15% (of the whole) were the peaches she originally had when 85 (all the remaining peaches) were subtracted.\n\n### Answer justification: \n\n1. The first step is counting the percentage of each peach Brenda was left with. That is: 60% of the whole, or 150 peaches remain.\n\n2. That 150 peches will be all the remaining peaches, leaving 145 (1-15).\n\n3. Thus, when we subtract 150 peas, 145 are left. That is 145- 15 in total.\n\n4. We know that Brenda picked 250 peas in the first place, therefore we end up with 145 + 15 = 160, or 123.\n\n5. She throws 15 away, but there is technically 1 less peach in total, that is, 124.\n\n6.

Therefore, the answer has to be A: $335.\n\n### Answer\n\nThe solution is here.\n\n### Your Question\n\nWrite an automated method that returns the index of the closest key to a target, according to their relative natural ordering, in a sorted array.\n\n### Example\n\nYour method should return a negative number if the target is greater than the value held at each index, and a positive number if the target is less than, equal to, or within 0.0000001 percent greater than (in the case of floats) each value.\n\n### Solution\n\nFirst, I am gonna define array. We'll assume that there a function called sort. We also assume that sort is sort of an array of integers that holds the natural order. Finally, find max. max is an external function that returns the indices of the maximum value in the given array.\n\n```javascript\nconst array = [7, 2, 1]\nconst findMax = function(array) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n        const max = array[i]\n        for (const value of array) {\n            if (value > max) {\n                Array.unshift(max)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return array[array.length - 1]\n}\n```\n\nThis is the function I came up with.\n\n```javascript \nfindIndexThatClosestToIndex = function (array, value) {\n    const sorted = sort()\n    const findMax = findMax()\n    const target = value < findMax? -1 * findMax : Math.abs(findMax - value) < 0.001 % sort? findMax : Math.sign(sort.indexOf(value)) * (value < findMax? -findMax : findMax - value)\n    const res = sort.indexOf(target)\n    return [-1 * res, res]\n}", "answer": " 705"}

One way to approach the tasks would be to build a program that simulates how a human would answer these tasks. \n\n### How are these tasks different from other tasks I have worked on?\n\n* Tasks are built from contextual examples. This enables more freedom in the task development process, allowing developers to build a task system that can capture the essence of a broad concept into a complex system of operations.\n\n* Unlike a Turing machine, which is constrained to one particular set of actions in response to a set of possible input data, the NN-Turing machine can respond to new input in new ways.\n\n* Unpredictability of the system allows the machine to generate outputs that are not easily predictable by humans.\n\n* A machine\u2019s actions are unpredictable, and the system can be built in such a way that it is not possible to predict the output from the input alone.\n\n* Uniqueness of outputs allows the system to find unpredictable ways of responding to input. This is an advancement from the classic turing machine as it offers the user (the human) more freedom from constraints than the classic Turing machine.", "answer": " 10"}

To convert it to a decimal, divide by 10, which will give 0.35. So 0.35 of 0.62 is 0.225. This implies that 225 is the number.\n\n### Response- 4 + 2 divided into 7 and 12\n### I am going to be using long division to add 4 and 2 to find out what those numbers are\n### to 7 and 1/2. I started off by doing the division and I ended with a 1/7 and 1/12\n### 8/7 would be the first one I got. then I moved on to the next and saw that my quotient was getting larger in both of my problems\n### My quotient and remainders were the same on both sides of the problems that were given to me\n### I believe that the problems given to me meant to ask for 14+9, and a+4,\n### 4+50 is 4/50 and it is also 1/12. The answer would give me 12/50. It is 1/4 so I have a lot of fractions.\n### I am not sure if that is true so I will add one more thing to prove what I think. If you subtract 9 from a(4+50), it is -9. Which is 9/50 or 1/5\n### So a+9 would also work\n\n### Instructor feedback:\nWe appreciate your response to this question.

A show can have 5 actors at a single time.\n### The second sentence has 5 actors as total actors who are in the show currently. So we use the second sentence to eliminate.\n### Finally we can eliminate C option. There are 25 acts and A option, 22 acts are already taken. That means there can be a maximum of 3 actors left on stage at a time. This was to make sure the show can go on without needing new actors coming on later.\n\nFinal answer: 3\n\n#### Answer: C (Both the first two sentences provide clues that actors will be 5 at a time and the number of actors in the show will always be 25).\n\n#### Rationales:\nActors are not limited to 5 per show and the total number of actors in the play can be more than 5. We can also assume that the total of actors will be 25, \n\nIn the play there are 5 actors at a show and 5 actors on the show overall. Actors rotate in and out of the show every 15 min.\n\nThese 3 actors are now on the show. Since new actors are added to the play, the number on the play is now 5.\n\nThis process is continued until all the 25 actors are on the show.\n\n\n### Input\nIn a 10-hour drive, Sam was driving first 5 hours, then took a 2 hour break, and then John drove the rest of the journey.

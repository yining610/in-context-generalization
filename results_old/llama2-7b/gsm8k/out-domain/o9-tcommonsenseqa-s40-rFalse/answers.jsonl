{"text": "John makes $16 per hour.\n\n### Justification:John is paid $80 per day.  He works at this job, which pays $80 a day, for 8 hours. His bonus is an extra $20 per day, totaling $160. The extra $20 he earns results in working 2 hours longer, for a total of 10 hours a day. He is paid $16 per hour (80 per day/5 day workweek).  He can also choose to skip the bonus, in which case he does not work longer hours.  The $20 bonus is added onto his regular pay which is $80, bringing his total pay to $100.  Therefore, his hourly pay is $100 divided by 10, making him $10 per hour.  Choose an answer that is equal to $10 an hour. Subtracting the 2x5 of the extra bonus ($10 per hour x 20 hours), and adding the 2x90 of the longer working time($20 per day x 90 days), results in $40.  That total of $40 does not meet the answer choice that is equal to $0.  Multiplying $20 by the number of days he works longer each week (30) results in $600. The answer may be rounded to $600.

{"text": "### Answer:\n\n### Conner's average speed will be 4.5 mph.\n\nThere are a few ways to solve this problem.  The easiest way is by applying algebra. The basic math is this: [4x] + [3x] + [2x] = [0.3x + 0.3x +.3x].  Multiplying both sides by 4 (and adding 12 in [2x +.6x]) yields [4x] = [12 +.6x].  Divide both sides by 4 yields.[6x] = [3. 3 +.6x].   Take.6x from both sides and solve for.[6x = 3.3 + x]\n\nSolving the above yields x = (.3 -.3) = -2, so Conner's average will be x = 6.5 mph x 4 = 26 mph.\n\nThe second way to solve this is through logic. Conner may ride 30 miles per hour, 20 miles per hour, and 12 miles per hours when he is on flat sand, uphill sloping sand and downhill slopes respectively.  So he rides at 30 miles an hour for 1/3 of the time, 20 miles an hour for the other 1/3 and 12 miles an hour for the remaining 1/3.  So Conner rides  [1/3 of 1/6] + [1/3 of (1/6)*2] +[1/3 of (3/6)*12] = [7+12+3] = 22 miles per hour. \n\nThe other way is similar.  Conner rides 1/3 of 60 miles an hour, 1/3 of [12 mph + (60/2)] and 1/3 of [(60*3)/2] respectively.  Solving the above yields x=20 mph.\n\n### Output:\n\n### Output explanation:\n\n### Average speed is 4.5 m/h.\n\n\n### Reference - 1", "answer": " 58"}

{"text": "He can make 0.38 pizzas with the flour left.\n\n### Rationale:\nInput:Jimmy is only 2 hours late this morning because he overslept. \n\nThe carnival only gave Jimmy 7 hours at most, Jimmy has 2 more hours,\n 22kg of flour to work with, and a pace of one pizza per 10 minutes. \n\nAt his current rate, he will finish within two hours.\n\nSince he got to work an hour late, he can work for two hours after that, if he\n doesn't make any pizzas, he doesn't have to eat.\n\n\nIn two hours, he takes 10 minutes to make each pizza.  22kg flour, divided\n by 200g per pizza, makes 22 pizzas. \n\n0.5kg is 200 per pizza, if Jimmy needs 0.5, he could make 20 pizzas.  If\n no pizza is finished at the end, it means there is left.\n\nIf left=0.38, that means 15.42 pizzas were sold.\n\n\nOutput: At most, Jimmy could have made 20 pizzes.", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "The number of pitted cherries that Veronica needs to have for her pie is equal to the number of single cherries in one pounds times the number of single cherry in 3 pints.  We have written the problem as \\(3\u00d7 80\\).\n\nThe single cherries that can be pitted can be found by subtracting the 10 minute amount that it takes to pit 20 single cherries.  We have written it as \\(20-10\\), or \\(10\\), because we know that it takes 10 minutes for 20 single cherrie to be pitted.  So our equation becomes \\( 3\u00d7 80-10\\).\n\nIf you add 50 to the left side you get \\(3\u00d785-10\\).  Divide both sides by 50 to get \\(60-2\\).\n\nLet's subtract \\(2\\) to the right side of the equation.  You end up with \\(60-4\\). Let's divide by 50 and you get \\(1.2-0.08\\).

{"text": "To understand this better, just imagine that Sandy had 1,800 tokens. Let's start off by choosing the first sibling. Because they have four siblings, there is a one in four chance that they will be chosen. In other words, each sibling has a 25% chance to be chosen. Here's two ways to do this:\n\n1. The probability of choosing the first one is 1/4. The probability of choosing any random sibling other than the first is 3/4.\n\n2. Let n represent any sibling, besides the first one. We know that n = 2, or n=3. Then P(n) = 3/4\n\n3. Let x be the first sibling. P(x) = 1/4\n\nThe total probability that she is chosen is then 1/4 + 3/4\n= 3/4\nThe probability that the first sibling is Sandy isn't 1/4. It is 1/4 + (1/4) \u00d7 (4/4) = 25%\n\nHowever, if she were to be chosen first, she would get 1440 total tokens. This means that the total tokens she receives would be 4x + (1\u2212x) 4n = 720 or in other words, 720x + 720(1 \u2212 x). After she gives half of this to each sibling, each sibling should receive 360 tokens. Since Sandy would receive 1440 tokens, that means the total that each sibling receives should be 1440 + 1440 = 2880.\nSince she has four siblings, she should receive 2912 tokens. This is the amount that she should have left over, and not shared evenly between her siblings.\n### Instruction :\nWritte a function called \"random_choice\" that returns the index of the chosen element.

When they are struggling with the second to last question in the instruction, it's fair to tell them that they need to write a simple ratio and then tell them it is to be of the form a/b where a and b are both positive integers.  There is a 50 to 50 chance they are either confused about how to arrive at these answers or are having trouble correctly expressing a fraction and the students should be encouraged to work in groups. It is important that these groups are mixed.  If a group only has women in it, then make sure at least one male is also in the group and vice versa.  This is because this is intended to be a collaborative environment.  Even if the female in that particular group is having difficulties understanding the task and is not capable of doing the math, her presence is important because she can learn from the male.

This sums up to 24 legs.\n\n### Input :The baker of the pie is making 10 pies, in order to get 4 extra pies out of it. He has a 10 inch tube full of 10 8-inch pie slices and 3 8-inch tubes full of 8 pie slices. Which tube should he open?\n\n### Demostration:\n\n### Response One Tube Opened\n\nThe baker chooses to open the left tube that is the tube that is filled with only 10-inch pie slices.  The reason for this is that in the two other tubes, both have a 7-inch thick slice of piping that has an 8-inch slice already put together in it.  So the next best option is to open the one tube that has only 8-inch slices in it.\n\nThe next step is to cut one of the 8-inch pieces into 2 4-inch pieces.\n\nNow he has 4-inch slices and 8-inch sices. The next step is to cut each of the 4-inch sliced pie into 2 2-inch pieces.\nNow he has 2-inch slices and a total of 160 pie slices that were already put together in the tube.\n\nAfter he cuts one of the 8's into two 2's then he counts how many slices can fit on the pie with pie tube being taped with the size of the 160, 2-inch sized pie slices on it.  That would be about an 8-inch thick slice because he has a half of an 8-inch in a regular pie.  With the two 2-inch sliced on and a half each and 160 slices and 164 slices, then he's not left with any room for the other two extra 10's that he has.  The only way that can happen is if there are slices that don't get to be t", "answer": " 40"}

This way, one can determine the probability that a person will check out a certain number of books.\n\n### Question:\nHow many books would one expect to check out of the library in one week?\n\n## Response:\nIn order to determine the answer, one would first need to determine the number of books that one would check out of the library for one week.  The question asks us to determine the average.  This is typically done by dividing the number of cases in the group by the number of subjects to get an average number of books.  In order to find some of the assumptions that the CLT is required, it is necessary to determine how many books a person normally checks out of the library.   The question doesn't give enough information to answer it and we don't know if it is meant to have a normal distribution or not.  If it does then it would follow the normal distribution approximation.  The formula for finding how many books one would get is NP where the n represents the number of books and the p represents the average number of books. N is the average number of hours that one would spend in the library.  It is also important to look at the bell curve approximation because if one has a normal distribution then one can be more accurate and one should use the bell curve.\n\n### Response\n\nIf one wants to find an approximation for the question then we would want to assume both normality and the bell curve.  This would mean that we should find the mean, the standard deviation, and the sample variance.  If the question is", "answer": " 160"}

There are 230 employees who do drive to work, for a total of 300 employees.\n\n### Note: The company has 120 employees who do not take public transport. There are 60 employees who take public transport to work, for a net of 60 employees who drive. It shows that 60 employees more drive to work than take the bus.\n\n### Input\n### Solution\nThe company has 60% of the 200 employees, so it has 120 out of 200.\n\nThe rest is half the non-drivers. So, 60% of 300 subtracted by half the non-driven employees, so it is 600-150=450.

The total number of employees is 27; The division of evenly is the same number.\n\n\nThe company has 30 employees who walk to work. 30% of the 12 who walk to work takes public transportation.  The company has 24 employees who take public transportation. 30% means 30-0.5(24)=5.4(2/3) which equals 1.59 (1.6) and is rounded, which is more than 1.3\n\nThis response is three sentences and seven questions.

{"text": "Libby built an igloo out of snow using 10 rows, 5 bricks of snow in length. The lower 12 bricks and the upper 8 bricks. Since the upper half of each row is shorter than the lower half, we can subtract the lower half (12) from the upper half (8). We will still be left with 5 bricks of equal height. Since she has 5 bricks of each height, we know that she has used 10 bricks in length. Since each brick was equal to 5 bricks width, we multiply that amount of bricks by 10. She used a total of 50 bricks to make her igloo.\n\n### Input\nThe following question provides details about a business that may be interesting as a part of a story, book, or poem.

{"text": "John worked more hours, than in a single week.  The days that he worked would be considered a 40+ hour week if not for a 24 hour day. You want to call him a slacker, because only the minimum wage worker needs to work 40 hours in a 7 day week.  The 8th is a day off by accident.  That is, no one would need to work one day longer than 8 days.  Then, they could take the rest of the week off, because he would have a 4 day work week if he had stopped working the day before he started.  He was a slacker, though he was probably a slave and not paid for his work.  However, since he had no paid days off, he likely felt like a slave, so they worked him like one.\n\n### Input 2:Jake did work from the start of the season to the end.  He did work every day including holidays. How many days did he work 8+ hours every day on his job?\n\n### response: He worked 365 days every holidays, because they always work holidays.  Holidays are often an exception to the normal schedule or a break time.  So, a person working in retail, construction, etc. always works holidays.  So, he worked 365 straight days including holidays, so the answer is 365.  Or, everyday was a holiday for the first 8 days after the season started.  They probably didn't think so, but it likely was a holiday for him.  Since his job had him working holidays, they should have given him a paid day off, so maybe his boss actually owes him money.\n\n### Discussion points\n\n1. The questions above might be tricky, because they might not be so easy to explain using a computer for the answer.  Some people just do not have the ability or opportunity to learn how to do math with a computer. \n2. The answer might have been a little confusing, because it's hard to work in 8 hour days if you're supposed to be working the same amount of time even when it's a holiday.\n3.

{"text": "Jenny's original amount of money was $60. There are two basic concepts here, the \"parts of a whole\" and how they relate to \"one over the whole.\" These parts are called fractions, and it is the reciprocal nature of this relationship (one part of a whole divided by the whole) that makes them function as fractions. If you take one part of a whole and divide that part by that whole, you will get the reciprocal of it, which will be either zero (if you have the whole and nothing left) or the other whole part of that same whole. In this case, you have a one third fraction, so you are dividing one third by the whole. You may already be familiar with using inverse fractions, where you use a decimal like.33333.. to solve math problems like this. This is the same concept operating here in reverse but with a fraction. Here are the steps to solve this problem. Divide Jenny's money by one full third: that will give you the part after Jenny spent one full third (1/3) of it. We just divided the whole by a whole part to get the remaining part of her money. So we have.75 (75/100) and because we know that 1/3 =.333,.333,.3, etc. we simply multiply.3333.. by 4 to get a multiple of that part:.1010101.. Now we have the denominator (whole) part of the answer and we need to divide.1010 by.333 to get the answer: 3.00 We know this is part of a whole because it ends in a three, so we put a 0 on the end of the numerator and that is the answer.\n\n### Input1: He had three oranges, two of them had worms and one did not.

{"text": "#### Solution 1\n\nThe first thing to do is notice that there was an answer and so it's an equation that needs to be solved. Then we multiply 65 times 2 by adding 5 to both the numerator and the denominator we get 550. The next step is to reduce everything into its simplest form and that is by dividing 65 and 2 to get 16, and then we multiply 550 by 16 to 9000, we can also simplify this to a decimal for the answer. So the answer to this problem is 9000/100= 90.\n\n### Solution 2\n\nThe first thing that we do to solve this problem is we need a question mark in the beginning so we know that we can only guess from here on out. The first thing that I do is I put a 1 in the quotation marks to indicate the 211 heads that the solver flipped. The next thing that I do is cross out the \"and\" since we only need one variable. The next thing that we do is divide the 1 by the 211 to get a decimal and multiply that decimal by the remainder 11. So we get 0.0483758. Now we need 100 to get it into its simplest form and we multiply that by 10 to get 4837.08. If we want to simplify that further we can round it to 4838 and get the answer of 4838.\n\n### Input\n\n#### Solution 3\n\n```\nIf a solver flip a coin \n\n211 times and get a head on 64 flips =\n\n15 flips more head flips\n```\n\n### Input \n\n#### Solution 4\n\n```\n\nFirst thing first, if a solver flipped a coin 210 times and got a head in 65/2=32 heads, that means he got 32 more heads. Then by dividing 32/65=0.5 from 211 you will get 106 flipped heads.\n\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nFor each of the 9 quiz questions,", "answer": " 81"}

{"text": "The lions in Londololzi grow in number at a rate of 5 cubs per month, but 1 per month die.  With 148 lion cubs at the end of the year, there must have been some start value.  If we solve for X, where X is the start lion population, using the equation: \"5*X+148=1000 X=-1000/5.\"  X=1000/7  X=0.1555 Recall from the problem statement \"there are some lions in the Londolozi\"  The lions in Londolzzi are born by a combination of 8,5,4, and 3.  Using the same pattern, we can find out how many lions in Londolzi were born in the first year, 0.155 * 8 = 1.24 lions were born in the first month.  Using the same lion birth pattern, each lion is born by 0.1573 or 1/6, so multiplying by 0.12 to each value.  We find that in the first month the lions added 1.555 * 1/6 * 1/6 = 0.01198125 to the first month lion population 1.4875 lions were born in month one.  This same method can be used to determine how many lions were born in a month after the first month.  Multiply the same numbers together.  A month after the first, 0.01898125 lions were born, 2 months after 0.058951919, 3 months after 0.11393937.

People have friends in grade school, middle school, and high school and those friends tend to stick by them. Friends often stick around through college, though there are some exceptions where there may be only one or two friends left, and the number of friends drops off after that.\n\nInput: 2.

There  is a very  strong  correlation  between  age  and  number  of  friends \n\nResponse: I do not agree with your assertion that there is a strong correlation between the age of a person aand their number of friends.  There are many people who seem to go through life without making friends. These people may be isolated from their peers for a long period of time, but they still manage to be happy and get by with their own thoughts.\n\nInput:3. Many factors cause the age a person gets a first boyfriend or  girlfriend to change, but the  two most significant are parenting style and school performance.\n\nResponse: You are incorrect in your assertion that parenting style is the primary cause of age at first boyfriend or girl friend. The most significant is actually schoolwork. A person's parents may think that their style of parenting is the cause of this correlation, but I  think it is actually the result of a high or  low quality high school education.

We plug in a=3, b=1, and c=2 since we can ignore values of t at this time.  x=3/4 (3 + 1) + x = x + 3 Since there are parentheses, we distribute the 3 and multiply it out, which yields x = (3/4)(4) + x = 1/2 + 1/2 + x = x+2/2+x Then subtract 1/2x from each side, the resulting equation is x=x+x+2/2=4/2+x/2=x+2x/2=2x.  Plug 2(1)=2 in for x.\nStep A: Solving for y yields y=1/4 (1+3)+y.  From the given information, this is equal to y=1/4(4)+y=1/4+3+1, which is equal to 4+1, or 5.\nStep A: The only way to add three to a quantity which is greater than 6 and less than 10 is to add one and then add one and one more.  The answer is 4 and we add it to 3.  The answer is therefore 4+3=7.\n### Input: You have 51 pennies and you wish to buy a loaf of bread for $2.60. How many loaves of bread can you purchase using these pennies?\n### Response:15 loaves of Bread\n\n### Explannation:\nYou need to have 2.60 dollars when purchasing your loaf.  This is possible if you have $0.51 of pennies but not possible if you have $2.60 worth of pennies.\nTherefore you need 2.60/0.51 pennies, which is 51.  You can buy a loaf of $2.60 of bread with 51 pennys if the bread only costs $0.51 per loaf.\nWe have found that the quantity of pennies is greater than", "answer": " 6"}

If 60 fish cost $42.5, then 75% would cost $31.25.\n\n### Explanation:Bucky earned $35 from Friday and Sunday combined. Because this $35 will go primarily to fish, the fish will only cost another $31.17.

They went with a total of 83 people, split into 5 and 3 people groups respectively. After the event, all of the people shared the candy. Each of the brothers ate 5 pieces of candy, and half of the remaining candy was distributed to 35 more people. How many candy did the brothers leave, respectively?\n\n### Demostration:\nLet x represent the number of candy left for the first brother, and y represent the number of candon for the second brother. Since they share, we have the following relation:\nx + 5y === 16\n\nThere's a couple of ways to solve this. First we could use synthetic division to express x and y:\n\nLet a1 = 5, b1 = 16, and c1 = 1\n\nx 5   +  5     y     +      16     +   1        =   16\n5 - 1 x -  1    =    37, y = 5, x = 0\n\nWe now have the following relation: 37 + 5x === 35\n\nTherefore, we want x to be 0, or 35. The only thing that can accomplish that is x = 16. From there, we can calculate y to be 31, which represents the number candy that the second brother left.", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "To answer this question, we need to start by counting the sum total of minutes Trey has to spend cleaning the house. We can assume that it will take 10 minutes to clean all of the rooms in his house. The sum of all those 10-minute times will be 70 minutes. To determine how much time he needs to spend taking a shower, we need to know that it will take Trey 5 minutes to shower. So the sum of all those minutes he spent showering will be 5 minutes, or 5 minutes. All together, he has spent a total of 70 minutes cleaning the house, 5 minutes taking a shower and 15 minutes making dinner. Therefore, he will take a total of 90 minutes. To answer the question, we need to double the sum because there aren\u2019t any days that Trey is going to clean the house. Since there are 2 days for Trey to complete the list, the total number of hours spent cleaning the house will be 2 hours and 10 minutes. Including the other parts Trey has to take care of, we can double the 10 minutes it takes to take a shower, and the 15 minutes it takes to make dinner. This will give us a total of 30 minutes. With this, we will have spent a grand total of 130 minutes on the list, which is equal to 2 hours and 20 minutes.", "answer": " 2"}

Some people will not want to be bothered with this, but I will bother with it.

I did not want this to happen, so I simply subtracted what I had to rather than going completely crazy.\n\nThe next thing to do was add the last two numbers because they are positive and this will not change anything in any way.\n\nAfter adding the two numbers that were 14 and 23 respectively, I now have a 23 minus a 14, so the answer to that is 9.", "answer": " 13"}

Find the largest number that can be subtracted from 74 so that 74 minus the number is divisible by 73.\n\n### Output: 7, 33, 5\n\n### Demostration(Given the example, you must understand the question's meaning): I will show you step-by-step how to get the answer:\n\n1: Find how many times the largest number from 74(37) is divisible. \n\nIf the largest number divisible is 1, it will be 74-1 =73. \n\nif the largest number divisible for 74 is 2, it will be 2*74=148. If the number divisible is 3, it will be 3*74=222. You can see, the number divisible is the sum of 74.\n\nThe number divisible from 74 is as follows:\n\n74 = 2+12+3-1\n\nTherefore, the largest number from the number divisible is largest number between 12 ~ 13, so the largest number divisible from 2 + 12  is 33.\n\n2+12=14\n\n14-1=13\n\n13+1=14\n\nIf the number divisible is number between 1 +2, which is between 3, it the largest number divisible 5.\n\n74 subtract 33 will be less than or equal to 41, which is divisible 73. Then, 41-5 will be 36. Therefore, 36+1=37.\n\n41-36 will be 5.\n\n### Question:\n\n### Demos:\n\n### Input:\"The only thing to fear, is fear itself,\" said Franklin Delano Roosevelt while being President.\n\n### Challenge:\n\n\n### Output:\"Achievement,\" replied FD Ro", "answer": " 31"}

{"text": "The input was to show a complete solution. The first thing you have to do is understand the question before you try to find an answer. Next you have to do an operation that solves the question.\n\nThe original input is:\n\nRick has 120 cards and he decided to only keep 30 cards and so he gave 10 cards to Miguel. Then, he saw eight friends and decided to give 6 cards each, and the remainder cards were equally divided for his two sisters. If each got 5 cards, how many cards Rick gave to Miguel.\n\n1st I need to find how many cards will have each person.\n\nWe do this by subtracting the original number of cards from the number that wants to be given to each person.\n\nThe total original number of cards is 120 (130-10-6(8)=120)\n\nThe total number of cards that will be given to each person is 35 (8(5)=35).\n\nSo this leaves 26 cards left.\n\n2nd I need to find how much of the 26 cards were given to Miguel.\n\nI already know how many total cards that Miguel gets.\n\nThe total number is 6 (10-5=5+10=15/2=6)\n\n3rd I need to figure out how much he gave to each girl.\n\n26-6=20 cards\n\n4th I need to figure out who got the rest of the cards.\n\nYou have 25 cards to give each of your sister.\n\nNext divide the total amount of cards you have to give with the amount of cards each person gets.\n\n25/2=12.5\n\n5th Do the math\n\nThe rest of the cards left is 6 cards for Miguel\n\nThe rest of cards are 12.5 for each of your 2 sisters\n\n6th The answer would be 6+12.5+6=24\n\n### CORRECT RESPONSE:\n\n###", "answer": " 13"}

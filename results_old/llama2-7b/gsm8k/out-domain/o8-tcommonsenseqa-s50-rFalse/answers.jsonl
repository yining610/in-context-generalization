{"text": "The answer is 20. All the students that are present are in the study room while the unlucky or sick students are in canteen.\nThe number of students in the study room is simply 40 minus 10, i.e., 30. Let's assume the number of students in the canteen be A, and the total students be 40. So the numbers of students in study and canteen are 30 and A respectively. As half of the students are in study and the other half are in canteen, and since 10 students are absent, therefore, 40 - 30 is equal to 40 - 10 = 10 students are in canteen, i.e., A = 10, therefore, the answer is 20 = (40 - 1/10) (3/4)\n\n**Reference:** [Solution 4.26](https://github.com/Srihari05/Midterm-Daily-Warwick/blob/master/Day-426.md)", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "1 Apple costs $12\n\n### Answer:  \nIf you multiply the number of apples with the price of an apple, 4, and divide it with the total number of fruits, 36,  you will get the price of an apple. The price of an apple is $12.\n\n### Explanation:How much is 36 fruits divided into 4 apples and 1 watermelons? You get 1 apple and 35 watermelons. From the question, I can tell that 1 Orange is $0.5, and an apple costs $1. If you got one apple, then 36 divided by 1 would be 36. 4 would leave you with 22 watermelons, which is not possible. When you divide 4 by 1, it would leave you with 4. After that, 4 multiplied by 1 would be $4.

The problem is stated this way: \" Harry put 4 blue and 5 green weights....Harry's custom creation.\" Based on the problem, Harry is putting together weights of different colours. Then he is placing weights on a metal bar. The metal bar itself weighs two pounds.\n\n### To solve the problem, I must create an _expression_. The expression is an equation that shows \"total amount of weight in pounds\". It must include four blue weights, five green weights, and the three pounds of the metal bar. We are missing the fifth blue weight and the fourth green weight. The expression we make is: 4 blue and 4 green and 2 metal.\n\n### I calculate the expression by subtracting the metal bar from each of the 4 blue and 2 green.

{"text": "5.66 ounces.\n\n### Analysis:  Let's draw 8 ounces of water from 8 shots totaling 12.0 ounces of alcohol (rounded to 2 decimal places).  So there is 9.66 ounches of water, and 2.36 ounces of alcohal from 8 shots.  So  1.5 ounches of alcohol, rounded to the nearest whole number, is 1 ounche.  In decimal, 1.5 is close to 1.6.  So  0.6 is close to 0.0.  So let round up 1.6 to 1.72 and round up 0.6 to 0.9. Adding these round decimals together, we get  2.38392 rounded to 2.39.  So adding 2.39 to the 9.66 of plain water gets us  12 + 2.39 = 14.39.  Since it is not necessary to add in the last digit, we can stop here and then realize that we are rounding to the next whole number, so there is 14.4 shots.  There is 12 for the shots of water, and 14.4 for the shots of alcohol.  12/2 =  6, and 6 = 2/3, and the 2/3 is the same as 75%.  So 6/2 = 3, round to the nearest whole number and it is 4.  Therefore, the alcohol content in the vodka is  50% pure alcool.  3 times 50% is  150%.  Now, one and half equals to  1.5, and the decimal of 1.5 is 0.5.  So  0/5 = 0 and 4.5/5 = 91.5%.  So 50/91.5 = 5.63, and the closest non-fraction that is less than the non-whole fraction, rounded to the nearest tenth, is 5.66.  The two decimal places in this question are meant to be ignored.\n\n# Exercise", "answer": " 3"}

D: The number of times Emery would read the book before completing the book on the same date as Serena. E: 1 (This cannot be done).\n\n### Input and Response: The problem involves calculating the average number of days each student takes to complete the library book read.  There are three options in the question that should be considered when finding the answer.\n\n### The first option states that Emery finishes the book within fifteen days. This is false and is the incorrect answer option. In this scenario:\n1. It is unlikely that Serena will finish the book within twenty days (The answer in this scenario is D)\n2. It is unlikely that Emery finishes within fifteen (This is false and is impossible considering the length of the problem. The answer is A).\n\n### The response option for the third option is Emery does not wait as long as Seana. This is false and also impossible.  As we saw in the example, it is only on the table when Eemery completes the book on te same day as Serena (A).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe response options (Serena reading the books on the same day as Emory) and (Emery reading the book on a day that is five times faster) must have similarities in order to be the correct answers. This is a logical and clear pattern seen when looking at the first and third options.\n\n### Reference\n\n1.

You shouldn't worry.

If he catches 5 and 60% of them are trout, and the remander is blue gill.\n(60% of 5)5 + (4 * 5)\n\nFrom here, what we need to find out is how much is the number that is equal to the above given data.\nWhenever there is a division problem, we also need to find the answer, and the answer is to solve the equation with a variable for both sides of the equation.\nThe variables are `a`, `b`, and `c` and the numbers would be the real numbers instead.\nTherefore the final equation should be something like: `5a + 5` or `a`.\nTherefore the equation is something like: `(60% * 5)5 + 5` or in the real numbers, `(3 * 5) + 5`.\nThe `3 * 5` is for the trout, and `5` with the 60% is for the blue fish.\nFrom `a` to `b`, the equation is:  `3` and `5`.\n\nThe variable `a` needs to be equal to the number in `b`, which is exactly `6` and therefore we can solve for the variable `a`:\n```\n6 = 3\n6 - 3 = 3  -->  a = 3 / 3 = 1\n```\nFrom this we can find the part of the equation which is `5a + 9` which is equal to `a`,\nthen the other part of which is equal to 6, which is equal to the `blue` fish that bucky catches.\nTherefore we can find what `a` is equal to what is given:\n```\na = (3 * 5) or 15 = (3 * -8 or -24)\na = -24\n```\nSince `a` is negative, it is not possible to buy the game, because there is something wrong with the calculation and it turns out", "answer": " 2"}

Explain\n\n### Instructor:If you were a student in a math class that taught math concepts from grades 3 to 8 how would you apply these concepts to help you with math in higher grade levels?\n\n### Student:The main grade 3 to 8 math concepts would be subtraction, addition, multiplication, and division. This is the basis of more difficult computations like long multiplication.  These can prove easier when doing long division if you've learnt long division and when doing algebra when you have learnt this concept.\n\n### Student:\"What is subtraction?  In subtraction, numbers which represent quantities are added to give a bigger number, the more important and the more different are the units we are interested in. There are some rules which must be observed, of which we must remember and note the main ones, as one should also remember the multiplication table. The first is the order of the numbers (the fact that when we write, for instance, 3-2, three takes precedence,and therefore we must consider the 3 to be subtracted from 5 in order to get the 2). Thus, when we work with greater numbers, we must always consider  the first unit as the smallest and the biggest as the principal or greater number.  To obtain more than one unit of subtraction, we must subtract a number more than any unit we have written and this can be done by adding the number by which we subtract. Thus in the case of ten, to obtain more than one unit, we must subtract any number greater than ten, as twelve. In addition, with fractions (see Fractions), the subtraction of one fraction from another is always performed in a ratio to one unit. Thus, when one unit is subtracted from another, the unit in denominator is diminished in the ratio that the numerator bears to the unit being diminished, or if two fractions are subtracted from each other the subtrahend unit and the subtrahend fraction unit are to be subtracted in the ratio that the number bear to this fraction.\n\nThe second rule which must be observed in subtraction is that when a fraction is subtracted from a number, it becomes reduced. Thus if one takes the fraction 14/5 from the number 8, the", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "### Instructions: \nThe number of appetizers needed is: 2.\nYou can calculate how many appetizers to make in many ways, the following are the most intuitive ways to do so.\n\n**One way:**\n\nLet Patsy buy 30 appetizers.\n\nWhen she puts out 30 appetizer for her guests.\n\nThere are 6 people times 30 appetizzers. That is 6*30=180 appetizzers given out.\n\nShe also has to make 3 dozen eggs. (216),\n\n2 dozen pigs (144),\n\n2 dozen kebabs (24)\n\nHow many are left over?  Subtract the last column from the first.  That is 146 appetizers left over. \n\nThe total number of appetizers are 6*30 and 142. We add them together and divide by 2.  That is 274+97 or 371 appetizers 274 left over which is the same as 97.  Divide by two to get the final answer of 2 because 372 divided by 2 leaves no remainder.   So it is the lowest integer that answers this question.  I don't know how long it took to get the answer.  It was easy to get it.\n\n**Second way:**\n\nSimilar to above:\n30 guests. 6 appetizers each. 2 deviled eggs, 1 pig, 1 kebab.\n\nThat is 30 appetizzer times 6 times 2 (two deviled eggs times two pigs times two kebabs)  equals 240 appetizers.  How many are left?  Divide that answer by 2 so that I get 120 left over. What is that answer?  That is a remainder after dividing it by 2.\n\n**Third way:**\n\nThe same approach:\n30 guests, 6 appetizers for each, 2 deviled eggs per person, then 2 pigs per person and 2 kebabs per person.\n\nIt doesn't have to be the same.

In this case the denominator is 5. If you take the largest meat piece and divide it by 5, the result is 1. In other words 1/5 is equal to 1.

You are asked for \"the 10% of 1206\". To calculate this, you have to know the value of 10%. There are many ways to calculate the value of 120% (the decimal). The two best ways to calculate this are to divide it in two ways:\n\n1) Use a calculator, then you see that 120% equals 1.2, or 0.12\n\n2) Use multiplication, and then you see that it equals:\n 1 + 0.10 = 1.1 + 0.00015) + 0.1666\n\n### Inst: The sum of 5 is the sum of 5 and 3.\n\n### Response : 8 \nThe following summing expression illustrates that five does equal three plus five, since every item on the left side is also on the right-side with an addition sign (x=0 )\n\n### Inst;The number 5 is greater than the number 10.\n\n### Resp;False\nOne has to prove that 10 is greater than 5, and the only way is to use math. The best illustration of 10>5 is to multiply both sides by 4 to show that 4 * 10=4 * 4+ 5. So now we see that 4 times 10 shows 40 and 4 times 5 show 20.

{"text": "32\n\n### Explanation:\nThe principal's best strategy is to get two queen bedded rooms from each hotel in the hotel chain. To do that, the rooms each principal needs to get from each chain is:\n\nHotel chain #1:  7 rooms\nHotel chain #2:  7 rooms\n\nAdding up all the rooms: 14 rooms.\n\nThe total number of students (assume a class of size four) is 30, which means there are 4 students per room.  This means each room can accommodate as many as 4 students.\n\nThen 14 rooms can accommodate up to 4 * 14 = 56 students.  Or put another way, 8 students per room.\n\nTo get a total of 90 students, the principal needs to book 32 rooms.\n\n### Reasoning\nEach hotel room has either 2 or 3 beds. No room has 4 beds.\n\n1 Queen bed room can accommodate up to a maximum of 2 students at most with 1 student taking one of the beds.\n\nA room with a pull-out cough has the capacity to comfortably fit up to 3 students, and at most, 2 students if no student takes the pull-out couch.\n\n### Reflection Answer the following question. If you had a sibling, would you prefer to be an identical twin or a fraternal twin?\n\n### Instructions: You have found two twins of the same sex and of same age. The first twin is a fraternal twin. The second twin is an identical twin. For the purpose of this question imagine that you are one of the twins and cannot communicate with your twin. You ask the doctor to compare your physical characteristics with the physical characteristics of your twin.\n\n### Exemplar Answers:\nIf you're an identical twins, you'd have a lot in common. You share the very same genes and would look very similar.  You would have very similar or identical birthmarks, medical conditions, allergies, blood types, and other physical traits\n\nHowever, fraternal twins don't share the same genes and would share fewer physical traits in common.

She made 3 small animal sculptures and 4 large animal sculptures. How many sticks did she use?\n\n### Demstration:\nFirst we count large animal sculptures using large number sticks (4). Then we count small animal sculptures using small number sticks (2): 2 is one more than zero so we skip the zero. Total number of sticks: 4 + 2 = 6 (the first 4 and second 2 add up to 6) 6 is 3 times the number 2.

So 3/4 of the 3 pounds remaining in the elevator is equivalent to 3/4 of 3 pounds = 2 pounds. So, the maximum loading weight that a person may gain into the elevator is 4 pounds. 137.9 multiplied by.4 = 55.16 pounds.

However, from September through February, Sam was only capable of doing only 8 hours of work\n3. Sam needs to make $220 to buy a video game for $600\n\nThe first number, $465, should be entered into the calculator. Since $465 is the amount of money Sam made during the period that he worked 23 hours, we know that the hours worked per dollar equals 20.41. So, to find the correct answer, you must use the percentage (20.41%) value to the hours (8) that Sam has worked. The answer is found by multiplying 20.4% by 8 and is the closest number to 0.226, which is 0.2259999621.\n\n### Solution: Sam made $468 doing 331 hours of work.

So you cannot have absolute and equations be the same, but we just made the word average the same.

After five weeks we total 3180, now that is not correct, because 6 cows produce per week 108 litres not 636. So the correct answer is 3.

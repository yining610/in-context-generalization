20:19:16,12 root INFO prompt: Context: Ted was excited about trying out his new lawnmower. He had recently moved to a house with a huge yard. He mounted his riding lawnmower and took it around the yard. In under 30 minutes, he managed to cut his large 4 acres yard. Ted thought his decision to spend thousands on the lawnmower was good.
Question: Why did He mount his riding lawnmower?
Let's think step by step: 
20:19:16,12 root INFO output: 1) He had the lawnmower. 2) There was a yard to be cut. 3) He wanted to cut the yard with a lawnmower. 4) He mounted the lawnmower.
We can't say much about 3) because it is a given fact. We know that He wanted to cut the yard with a lawnmower.
We also can't say much about 4) because we don't know what He did. But 4) seems to be a step that is required for step 3.
So, we can say that He mounted his riding lawnmower. He mounted the lawnmower because that is how you cut the yard with a lawnmower.
I am not sure if this is the intended answer. My best guess is that the answer is (2).

What algorithm and steps do you imagine using? Does your implementation attempt to implement any more sophisticated algorithms?<n><n>Answer, Answering question and returning correct answer is probably one of the most simple and straightforward implementations. Mostly, it is a "if else" statement to check the choices. There might be some use of some tricks for a better implementation but nothing too complicated.<n><n>The main challenge of this implementation came down to the way the question was asked. I didn't realize the first question was so long! I could probably have done it a bit better now with the way I write the Answering question. For example, I might have put the question into the "answering question" function and made it all more clear.  So that would have looked something like this:<n>```<n>function Answer<n>{<n><n>    // put question in here<n>    <n>    return Choice.Equals("Output")<n>}<n>```<n><n>The rest though seems mostly decent and the algorithm seems reasonable.<n><n># What is the hardest part of the algorithm? Can you show a pseudocode or UML diagram for it? Did your implementation do everything that pseudocode / UML diagram did? What was hard in your implementation?<n><n>Answering question turned out to be the easiest in the program because it mostly relied on reading the instructions,  but it turned out not to be so easy as I might have thought. This is because that if I wanted to keep the program as short as possible, I had to split the original question into several shorter ones which took more time. This also took some extra care to make sure the function did everything the instructions did.<n><n># Did you implement any "clever tricks" for answering? If you did, you might consider describing your trick in more detail so that the reader might be able to implement a similar approach.<n>Answering question was made "easier" by not having any extra tricks for answer. This would have been easier if I implemented some things differently. Like the actual questions. In hindsight there are some things that could have probably been better.<n><n>### How well does your program answer the

This can be found by multiplying the current cost by 1.25<n>D) 56.00 * 1.25 = $6,750<n>E) Therefore a kilogram of nuts cost a total of $12.05. This can be simply calculated by dividing the total by the 2.5kg of nuts and multiplying the costs.<n>F) 6,750 / 2.5 = $2,666.00<n>G) For fruits we have to multiply the total cost by 1.5 so that it becomes 1.875.<n>H) 2.5 times 8 is $20 so we can simply multiply it by 1.5<n>I) 20 x 1.5 = $30<n>Challenge: This is a challenge for the 10 minutes as there is some very easy division and multiplication but also some more complicated percentages and working out money to 1 decimal place.<n>```<n><n><n><n>### Answered by: <n><n>[`kaspervandenabeele`](https://github.com/kaspervandenabe)<n><n>`GUI` and [`kaspervandenaborbee`](https://github.in/kaspervanderborbee)<n><n>### Answer explanation:<n><n>This question is asking you to calculate how much the fruit and nuts cost in total<n><n>You will see that this information is given to us in a different format, percentages!

To make the challenge more efficient, the code should create the following structure as an example:<n>````python<n><n>"""Problem 1"""<n>"""Problem 2"""<n>"""etc"""<n><n>### Solution:<n>Create a list of tuples corresponding to a list of text. Each tuple contains a question text and the correct answer. We also added numbers to distinguish each question. To make the code more readable later on, we choose `def` to wrap the question set.<n>### Step 1: Importing necessary functions <n>````python<n>from collections import Counter<n>from statistics import mean<n>```<n>### Step 2: Import question data<n>We first parse the text data from the file. The questions are separated into parts by different lines. At the same time, the Counter instance uses the `defaultdict` function to default a value of `0` to `['Question', 'Answer']` if it does not exist in the text content. The counter instance uses the content as a key and uses the frequency of the word as its value. The value of `most_common` is a list that consists of key-value pairs that have the largest count value.<n>### Step.3: Check the length of input question to output the message according to the result<n>Here we use a series `of list comprehension` operations to generate `['Question']` and `['Answer']` according to whether the result is even or odd, then use the method `split` to obtain the Question and Answer respectively. We set `question = " ".join(q)` and `answer = " ".join(a)` to generate question and answer by joining every space in the list.<n>### Step4: Display the question to the user<n>Using `input()` to display the question to the user and use `raw_input()` to take users input.<n>### Step5: Calculate the number of "Yes" and "No" to generate the most common word<n>We use `most_common` to obtain the key and value. The number of "Yes" can be calculated through count `counter["Yes"]`, same goes for

Therefore, he spent a total of $9.<n>```<n><n>(c) <n><n>```shell<n>Input: The fuel price for $200 for 1.0L of fuel, and the capacity of extra tank of $200 for the 2 times original fuel. If the fuel price has increased by 20%,then the new price is $\$^{20\%}_{1220\%}\$(\$/1.0L)×1.0L = \$200×1.22 = \$244.00 for each unit. So the total price is $200×2 $ = \$400.00<n>```<n><n>(d) <n><n>```sql<n>Input the score for the two players is 30, therefore, the number of the goals for each player is $200/30 = 20<n>```<n><n><n><n>(e) <n><n>```cpp<n>Input: Tom drinks 5×12÷12=6 12 ounces or $240 ounces water, then he drinks 64÷12$=88÷12=86 ounces per day, and the total week is $240+88=328÷7 = 47 ounces per day.<n>```<n><n><n>(f) <n><n>```python<n>Input: The volume of the truck is $\sqrt{100000}$ and the truck filled the volume for 4 hours, therefore the capacity is $250×8=450×4=$1800.<n>```<n><n><span></span>

The output of 12 should be "5", as it is the remainder of the answer.  All of the others should equal what they are suppose to.<n><n>Comment: Yes it seems to work properly for me, output of 12 is correct, 13 outputs -2, 14 outputs 1, 16 outputs 2, 42 gets divided by 2.<n><n>Comment: Your code doesn't handle numbers with more than one digit as fractions correctly.<n><n>Answer: For dividing the result should be `answer/(10**((len(str(answer)))-2))`, eg:<n><n>\strong{Ex:} when 13 divided its output `1.2` we need to round this up to `1`.<n><n>So we use `13/(10**(1-2))=1.2`, then do upcasting: `answer=int(12*10)//10`, you can try this for all the 8 questions. Try this out, if you still face any problem comment below.

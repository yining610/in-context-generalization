When the function runs it will find all the answers in the reference string, and return a list of strings where each answer is the first word of an answer string.  You will need to put the correct answer into the answer list in the same order as it was asked in the input string.<n><n>The function will have two special values as input parameters.  The first one (called 'AnswerFlag' should be True if the entire list has been found.  It will be False if it was not found.  <n><n>The second special value (called "StopFlag" should be set to True if after processing that special value you want the function to exit.  It should be set to False if the special string is not the last special string in the input string.  <n><n>The default input for the first special value is that you should not use this, the second default for the special value is to allow you to just look for the first special value.<n><n>When you have finished this exercise, go and do it again. Now, instead of finding the answers, you will need to match them in the same order by the same number of word for words and for the same number of letters.  You will need some help from your partner to help you do that!<n>### Note:This is

I went to the store and bought ___ apples. ____ apples cost $0.35 and I was all out of change<n>### Solution:  <n>Please answer using comments.<n><n>### Input - Pig latin<n>Input: My dog is very smart.  Can he learn pig latin? Let's find out!<n>My dog is very smart. Can he learn pig-latin? Let's find-out!<n>**Output:** My dog is very smart can he learn pig Latin<n>### Solution: In pig Latin, a word's initial syllable is moved to the end of the word.  If the word begins with a consonant, a "ay" is added to the end of it. Examples:<n>```<n>pig Latin (without ay)<n><n>spay      ayspay   "space"<n>pyc        apyc      "pick"<n>```<n><n>In pig Latin, the "initial" syllable is moved. "Initial" here means the syllable that comes first after the word is split at hyphens or spaces. Thus, "My" becomes "My-", the syllable "my" would be after both of the hyphens in your example.<n><n>Let's do it from the beginning. The word "dong" becomes "dong-ay", not "do nay" with "nay" being the syllable after "do

It is very possible that you, me, and everyone we know might not like it. Of course there was an element of randomness with regards to whom likes it.  This is often the case in real life.  I would want to get some idea of if I should buy a ticket or not.  What is a good approach to do this? <n>Output: Ask everyone if they like it. Then calculate the average and then predict your chances if you're in the average group (like 24%). <n><n>Answer:<n><n>1a. The answer must be rounded to the nearest integer.<n><n>1b. The amount of money remains $4 ($100 - $96).<n><n>1c. This has two parts: one for the legs of the animals, and the other to add up all the legs. 23 can be represented as 10k + 3. We can use kk to obtain 10k.<n>We get 23 = 10k +3 which is equivalent to 4 *k +3 =23. This gives us: k = 23 - 13 = 10, meaning the total number of legs for all the animals is 10 times 10, 100 legs.<n><n>1d. We are dealing with two things here - the average that a person's choice is liked by other people and the average percentage of people that would like the movie. The average that a person' likes the movie is based on the 24 percent that like it. So, for each person, there is 23.75% chance that we like the movie.<n><n>I know that this question is based on mathematics, stats, and logics.

From A-Z the sum of the letters that are odd is: 1+3+5+7+9+2+4+6+8+10=53. But, the sum of the letter is a sequence (from odd letter to odd letters) is 1+3+7+15=26.

Choices:  A: building B: office C: library D: table E: bathtub<n>Output:		bathtub<n>\end{code}<n><n>Answer: \strong{Bug:} there are a few places where your code is reading things twice. For example<n><n>\begin{code}<n>  int answer2 = in.nextInt();<n>  int a = answer2;<n>\end{code}%<n><n>and<n><n>\begin{blockquote}<n><n>\begin{itemize}<n>  \item \begin{itemize}<n>\end{itemize}<n><n>\end{itemize}%<n>\end{blockquote}<n><n>should be<n><n>\begin{pre}<n>    int answer2 = in.readInt();<n>    int a = answer2 ;<n>  \item \strong{Increment}: 1<n><n>\begin{enumerate}<n>\end{code}\\*<n><n>As a side note there are several comments that suggest you know how this works. You really need to start writing the code like you would write English.<n><n>When you read a String or an Integer the `read...` function stores it in a buffer (array). When you call a method it is used as a parameter - the method uses the value in the buffer the first time. `readInt` reads the integer and stores it in a buffer. `a = answer2` uses the \em{same buffer}. Change the code so they use different buffers. For `readInt` use `answer2 = in.readInteger();`.<n><n>For the `enumerate` type questions. You could do something like<n><n>\begin{align}<n>while ( in.hasNextInt )<n>\end{align}<n><n>or<n><n>\begin{bmatrix}<n>  in.readInt();<n>\end{bmatrix}<n>\end{blockquote}%<n><n>where you increment your counter based on the number read.<n><n>You might want to simplify it further. Consider using an `Integer` as your `counter` and just doing<n><n>\begin{block}<n> while ( in.hasNext ){<n>     enumerator.int( in.readInt() );<n> }<n>\end{block}<n><n>It seems to answer the question the same as the original code, but it gets rid of a bunch of duplicated code and makes it easier to modify later if they add a new type of question.

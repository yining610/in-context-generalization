The objective of the course is to prepare you for technical/programming interviews by practising and training your problem solving skills. One of the challenges I faced was actually getting the question wrong twice! I was very confident that I wasn't going to get this question wrong. I had to think about how I tackled this question carefully as it is quite similar to a problem that was given in the previous section that I could have easily gotten wrong. <n><n>My answer was correct but there was clearly a typo in this question. I also failed to notice that some answers were listed multiple times on the output so I incorrectly highlighted 2 answers for one output question. So with that in mind, I've been practising the questions more extensively so that I can have a better understanding of where I went wrong. Furthermore, I believe that the more problems you tackle the more confidence you have in your ability.<n><n><n><n>#### Input - In questions that ask 'what can go on a football', there is typically only one clear answer to choose from so I would have to find the word that was missing from the question. With that in mind, I would search for key words that were present in my list such as:<n><n>```<n>football => C: college<n>campus => A: oklahoma<n>players => D: players<n>```

What is the value of x -2?<n>Output: 98<n>\end{code}<n><n>I tried using a dictionary of the strings and their values, to see if there is a way to solve this problem.<n><n>Comment: Have you tried using a method like *filter*, *find*, or *map*? Have you thought about the fact that an ordered list can be reconstructed from the values of an *dict*.?<n><n>Comment: You probably could also just get the string of the order and then re-construct the order from the data structure. In that case, you wouldn't have to use *filter*. *find* and *map* come in handy in other use cases.<n><n>Comment: I mean, that is basically correct. You'll run into a problem when you see *filter* in a test case. *filter* accepts a function as input. That function will return a boolean, indicating whether the given element is retained in the result of the invocation of *filter*.<n><n>Answer: You're basically on the right track with your `dict` approach, but you need to do a little more analysis:<n><n>First, you're right to take the first number, let's call it `x`, and iterate over `lst` for each number from `x` to `n`.<n><n>So, for example, with `x=3` and `n=5`, we'd get the following tuples:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>In [29]: lst = (3, 4, 5)<n><n>In [32]: for y in range(x, n):<n>  ....:     print([i for i,j in enumerate(lst) if

I have lived a rather sheltered life, which I know I must get out and change. My older brother gave me permission to go to a club where he has been several times without his parents' knowledge. I knew it was going to be a night filled with some kind of chaos, but never in a million years did I think it might be my last night! At this point, I am a self-centered, rude, and uncaring person. I have never experienced love or a real sense of happiness. Even with the little experiences I have had with women, they never lasted and were always just a one night stand. So going into this club, I am expecting that it will be just like any other place. However, this night has already changed my life for good or bad, at this point, I just do not know what the outcome will be.<n><n>*The lights, smoke, loud noise, strobes are overwhelming to say the least. I can barely even see the people that I am surrounded by. Not to mention, the people in the bar are completely different than anyone I have been around in my life. They are rude, nasty, obnoxious. I do not fit in. As my night progresses, I am offered many different things, which includes being invited to someone’s house for a “party.” Not being the savvy street type person I know most of these people are, I say yes and immediately regret this. All I ask is that I be dropped off. As we leave the bar, I see where we are going. We are going to the club located across the street. As soon as this happens, I know I am in trouble. My “hosts” ask me questions about whether or not I want to buy more drugs, which of course I do not. However, I was given a choice of where they would take us. So I choose not to go back to the club, but I am wrong. We end up going back to the club, which is full of police. As the police surround my new found friends, I am asked if I am with them. Not wanting any trouble, I answer yes despite knowing I am not with them,

This reflection, as I understand, is done by:<n><n>- Flipping the current matrix along the x axis.<n>- Calculating where the new values will be mapped by using current y position minus x position to get the new y position.<n>- Rotating the input matrix left 90 degrees, and moving left to the original y position. <n><n>The function looks like: (using numpy)<n><n>```Python<n>def rotate_counterclock_left(M):<n>    """<n>    Rotate the matrix 90 degrees counter-clockwise<n>    :param M: input matrix<n>    :return: rotated matrix<n>    """<n>    length = len(M)<n>    # copy matrix into new list and rotate it 90 degrees<n>    M2 = np.zeros(shape=[length, length]*2)<n>    M2[:, :length] = M[:, length:]<n>    M2[:length, :] = M[:, :length]<n>    # reshape the rotated matrix into its original size<n>    M2 = M2.reshape(len, length)<n>    return np.tri(M2)<n>```<n><n>This can be executed by:<n><n>- Using numpy's `triu` and `tril` to create the upper and lower triangular matrices that make up the original matrix.<n>- Calling `rotate_counterclock_left`.<n>- Reshaping the returned value to fit the original matrix shape.<n><n>

Which of the letters is not an English alphabets.<n>Output: Not valid Choice<n><n>#Answer<n><n>'''<n>### Solving the first question of the quiz.<n><n>The coder needed to write a function that given a list of two numbers (x, y) and returns how many number of candies does Corey has.<n><n>1. First step will be to split the list. We will find the first number, x, which is 66 and the second number, y, which is 8.<n><n>2. Next, we should now know that the value of x or 66 and the value of y or 8. So x equals 66 and y equals 8, which allows us to call our variables.<n><n>3. Lastly, we need to do is find how many candies Corey has. Corey has x candies, which equals 66, then we should subtract y candies, which equals y/8, or 8, because the y number of candies that Tepanga has are 8 more than the Corey number of candies which are 66/8, or 66 - 8. But, this will be done to each other, which will make 66 - 64. Therefore, this will equal to 2. So, Corey has 2 more candies than the Tepanga candy numbers, or 66 candies or 2 candy numbers.<n>'''<n>

There are 4 envelopes and each envelope has a different number of coins in them. They play the game as follows. John picks any envelope to open, he can choose any envelope and looks at how many coins there are, whether it being $2, $5, $10, or $20. He does not show anyone what the envelope is with what coins it contains in it, and he closes the envelope and leaves it where he picked it from. He leaves the other 3 envelopes closed. Next, Sally also picks any one of the 3 remaining envelopes, closes the one she picked, and leaves it closed, before she looks at one of the remaining two envelopes, and picks one to open. If Sally picks the envelope with what John picked when he picked one envelope and left it closed, she wins, and if she picks a different envelope, she loses. Sally can leave the remaining envelope closed and open the same envelope that she would have picked if she had won the game. Next, Tony picks one of the two remaining unopen envelopes. He also closes the one he picked before he opens it, and he looks at the other one envelope. Finally, Bill picks the unopened envelope that had the lowest number of coins in it, and opens the envelope that he picked, and if he wins, he leaves the other unopened envelope closed. If Bill wins, then each one of John, Sally, and Tony loses. Bill wins if he is left with at least $10, no matter what other players do. John starts and is followed by Tony, Sally, and then Bill.<n>  First, we notice that Tony would definitely have picked envelope No. 2, as that is the only envelope left that hasn't been opened at that point if he has picked one of the two envelopes open at that point. Therefore, John would have picked No. 3 with $5 (as John would never have picked No. 4 if he had to pick an open envelope afterwards) and Sally would have picked

I figured out that 80 is the constant between taptanga and corey. Also, I have known that 9+1=10 so 10 is the most possible number. Therefore, I knew that corey could have at most 9 candies. Also, we know that taptanga could only have 19 candies. And I knew for sure that taptanga can't have 19 candys because that means that he will have less than corey. Therefore, I figured out that he could only have 10 candies. Then I checked the answer by taking 29 - 8 = 21. And by doing this operation it proved that they only had 29 candies.<n><n>

Choices: 1 3 4 5<n>Output: 7<n><n>***Explanation:** This question is based off the word 'tragically', which only has 7 letters and its 'error' is in 7th letter. <n><n>Instruction from this code was very simple. it showed 12-choice question on the screen, but we need to answer multiple choice question. There are three different question type and two types of answer (one is single-answer, and another is multi-answer; that means we have to enter the answer in numbers from 1 to 4). At the start, the screen does not have any question, to generate the questions, we need to move two pointers(start_ptr & end_ptr), until they meet on a space between questions. After the pointers meet the space, we print out question and choice one by one. I decided to use char to build up every choice; it's quite simple to understand as shown in the code below. <n>~~~<n>printf("%i\n",end_ptr-start_ptr); // how many bytes have been read<n>char* str =start_ptr ; // the address is in start_ptr<n>while(str++!= '\n'); //move the pointer up to the next line<n>start_ptr = str; // make it start again<n>printf("%i\ngood morning, %s\n",str-start_ptr,start_ptr); //print the question and who asked the question<n>char* str2 =start_ptr ;<n>while(str2 && *str2!= '\n') //find end of next line<n>   {<n>   printf("%i\n", *str2++ ); // print the letter of choice up to space <n>   if(*str2 == '=') // if choice is ==, print 1.<n>     printf("1\n");<n>   else if(*str2 == '#') //if choice is #, print 2<n>     printf("2\n");<n>   }<n>~~~<n>The question part is built in single-answer. If it is multi-answer question, I need two more loops; one is for multi-answer choice, and the other one is for the answer part. But in this time, no input is needed for the end-

For example, for Question 1, you can make an Array called "a" with the numbers "1,2,3,4,5". Then you can compare the index in each array to get which values are shared. You can then make a new array "b" as a sort of temporary holding cell to keep track of the indices that aren't shared.  For your code to work though, you have to make sure you don't create an infinite loop if the array indices are equal.

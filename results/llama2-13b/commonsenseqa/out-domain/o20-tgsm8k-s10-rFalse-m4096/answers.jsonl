{"idx": 35, "text": "E\n\nAnswer the following:\n\nGive a simple example of a problem that we might solve by using the divide-and-conquer strategy, and explain why we might chose this approach rather than a brute-force solution.\n\n##### Bruteforce approach:\nAssuming a brute-force approach to solve a problem is to write code for every possible path. For instance, to check if a given path is reachable, we need to create for loops to check all the steps we would take on the map to get to the given goal-location. However, this will not work for a path problem if there are duplicate paths that lead to the same destination and then we will have to account for every possibility, and this can become impractical due to the exponential time complexity.\n\n##### Example of a problem using the divide and conquer approach:\nAssume we have an unsorted list of elements. For a brute-force algorithm to solve this algorithm, we would need to compare each element one by one against each other element to see if the element < the other. For n elements, there would be n(n-1) comparisons, and when we do this for every element, there would be n^2 comparisons for all the elements.\nFor a divide and conquer approach, we can partition the given list into the second half and first half. If we perform a comparison of the first half with itself for two values, we only need to compare it against the second half with itself. Each list would now only have half the number of elements. Now there would be n(2^n) comparisons.\nThis is the case for a divide-and-conque strategy. Here we have divided the problem and conquered it and also gained the best case of O(nlogn)\n\nGive an example of a problem you can solve with the divide-and- conquer approach, but not more efficiently than using an iterative approach, and explain why this is the case.\n\n##### Iterative approach:\nAn iterative approach refers to breaking a problem into an array of smaller and more easily solve problems and solve them one by one, then combining the solutions to solve the bigger problem. For example, we can use merge sort to sort an unsorted list.\n\n##### Problem for divide and conquer\nProblem: Given a list of elements, create a list of all the subarrays for a given length n.", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

The correct approach depends on your situation.\n\nThe approach used by your code appears to be iterative, using a counter as a state and incrementing that counter every time the test yields a TRUE, i.e. the test succeeds.\n\nYour program has a couple of things that makes it slightly less efficient than it could be:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the counter variable is rebuilt every time all the tests succeed, which can only happen when the input is a YES, so the counter value is reset to zero each time\n\\item at the end, the function returns zero; this also happens for a NO, which does not seem like a useful or efficient thing to do\n\\end{itemize}\n\nBecause you're starting from zero, it's also slightly slower as it performs more checks than, say, the naive brute force approach that just asks for the input and if that input is \"yes\" or \"yes yes yes yes yes yes yes\" then it returns True, else False.", "answer": "D: parking lot"}

His manager has to pay taxes to the state as well as unemployment benefits for the entire company.  If Mike\u2019s manager uses the same percentage of Mike\u2019s pay to pay for those two items, and assuming his manager\u2019s tax rate is 30% and that he pays 25% for UI benefits, what are the manager\u2019s total costs for Mike?\n\nWhat did you answer? \nOutput: 270\n\n\n\nAnswer: This question is missing some of the details we need to determine what Mike\u2019s manager is paying to the state.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem that the manager pays the same percentage of Mike's pay in taxes and UI benefits. Let\u2019s call that 35% -- taxes plus UI benefits. \n\nSecond, for the state tax purposes, let's suppose that Mike is allowed a personal exemption of, say, $10,000, and that then a further 10% of the pay amount is paid by the manager as taxes. This means the manager pays 45% of the pay as tax plus UI benefits.  If we divide this by 35%, we see that the taxes would equal 13 of the 270. But he also pays UI benefits, so let's suppose that this equals 5%. We are almost there - 40% has gone towards tax and UI benefits, leaving only about 260 to be left over for Mike. But Mike is actually earning a weekly salary of 400 (52*8). If 40 went to taxes plus UI benefits, let's suppose another 40 (10%) goes towards deductions. This means that Mike, in the end, would take home 120 ($400-$130-100) every week. \n\nAnd this is why, my friend, you failed the test.\n\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple choices questions.\n\nInput: For each of the next 5 questions, enter a 5-", "answer": "D: answering questions"}

There are 4 birds, one on each tree. Each bird is equal distance from the nearest bird when it comes to nesting. One bird moves north every day. The next day, the northward movement continues in 3 equal groups along lines equally separated so that two thirds of 1 of the groups follow the first group, and one third of 1 of the remaining groups follows the first and second groups, so there is always 1 group of 1 bird north (the furthest away), and 2 birds at equal distance from the first northward movement (the closest away). After that, the movement occurs in reverse (south) for 2 days while this is still the case. The birds only nest on a tree if it has a gap between bird occupancy.

A random number is generated between the numbers 1,2,3,4 with the number 1 indicating the block with the king of hearts and 4 indicating the block with the jack of spades. If the user guesses the correct block, he is given the appropriate information, if he guesses incorrectly, a random block is chosen and the cycle continues. draw a card and choose an even or odd block at random. If the block is even, the user is given that information. The algorithm for the computer can be implemented in a few lines of code. The block is chosen for the computer in a manner similar to how the user is guessing. If an even block is chosen, the computer plays along; otherwise one of a small number of incorrect blocks is picked. If we can get the user in a loop, it will probably be because they are guessing even blocks. A deck of cards is shuffled. A random integer is generated to pick between all the cards as the random block. If the user guessed the correct card, the algorithm returns that number. Otherwise, a new int is generated to pick between the remaining cards. When the user enters odd or even, an int is generated and the int, when between 0 and 2, will determine the block. The block is then returned to the user. Draw a random block and choose a random block", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

The company had to buy 100 new desktops, each of which takes up 4 users per server. Each desktop costs $400 (it costs that much no matter how many desktop computers are bought) so that is a lot of money and they are pretty overloaded now at 100 servers but they need to get that new server software that the company is developing and they need to buy 2 for each server. The rest of the information is that 5 servers cost $10,040 (an extra $40) and that 7 servers cost $29,422 so you can calculate that to get 100 servers would cost at least $70,000 so it is a lot of money.

For example, you've suggested the use of a variable, `n`, but you haven't explained how `n` could then be used to generate the desired output.\n\nAnswer: You seem to have a good understanding of Python.  You have chosen to use a simple nested `for` loop to iterate through the multiple choice questions in the datafile, and then you ask for the user to choose a letter for each answer.  You take the data you have been given for that question, and convert the first character of each line into an integer, calculating these values and producing an answer.\n\nYou would benefit from using a dictionary to keep the list of the number of times the user has answered a question correctly and the number they have answered incorrectly.  For each question, you can take the result from the user's answer, increment the counter for that question in the correct answer count by 1 and the incorrect answer count by 1 in the dictionary.

Choices:  B: cow C: maid D: poodle E: shepherd\nOutput: B\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: The problem might be solved in O(n), where n is the number of question-answer pairs.\n\nThe first step is to split each string by whitespace, and store each word in a set in order to eliminate duplicates.\n\nThe next step is to filter the set to a list of elements with equal length (3 or 4).\n\nThe third step is to remove duplicates of the \"option\" strings. This is possible, since we already split the input strings.\n\nComment: If we store sets (which are essentially hash maps of elements with unique keys), then we will already have unique elements, which means that removing the duplicates will be trivial (or a matter of a simple `list.remove()` method call).\n\nAnswer: Here's another solution which is similar to your's using sets.\n\nThe solution uses the `re` module to split the text into tokens and then uses the token string as keys in a dict with the remaining answer portions as values.\n\n\\begin{code}\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nimport re\n\ns = \"\"\"\nInput: Adam bought? kilograms of n...., 2.5 kilogram....

The students that passed all sections that month are shown in bold and italic with values over 5 in bold:\n\nIf the values are not as they appear in the table when you submit, contact me with information on your OS, browser with version number, and computer brand and model. I will fix the issue as soon as possible.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nInstructions :\n\nTo solve the riddle, simply follow the instructions given.\n\nFirst, let's find the number that is represented as D. This is the only number with only one occurrence, because no other number in there is isolated.\n\nThen you may proceed to finding A. It is the one closest to the given number on the right, so A = 5. This number, 5, now occurs twice in a row.\n\nThen we are done, except that we found A, but it isn't one of the choices. This is because we are now looking at B.\nSo then, what is the only difference between these two 5s? Just look at both cases in turn.\n\n- B is the 5 that occurs before another 2, while A is not.\n- A is the 5 that is preceded by other numbers, but B is not.\n\nThat is why B is the answer.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nInstructions In the questions that follow answer the questions in each of the statements. \n\nA survey in my school shows that:\n\n- 28% of students play hockey and basketball\n\n- 42% of the remaining students play hockey and not basketball\n\n- 32% of the remaining do not play hockey and do not play basketball\n\nLet n be the total number of students and d = n-4 be the number of students who play both hockey and basketball.\n\nStatement 1)\n\nA student who plays both hockey and basketball must certainly have a friend who will not play both and must possibly choose between playing hockey or basketball.

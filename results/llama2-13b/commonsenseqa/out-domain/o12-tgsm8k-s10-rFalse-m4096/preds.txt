We can reduce this `len(listA)` to `a` and `a.append` to `extend`. The code also contains a redundant `listA[index] == ` condition. Finally, the `return index` can be replaced with a simple `return`.<n>```python<n>a = listA<n>for key, value in sorted((value for key, value in dictA.items() for value in a), reverse=True):<n>   break<n>return key<n>```<n>

Additionally, he spends a third of the time he spends warm-ups and doing cardio every day. How many hours does he go to the gym every week?`<n> <n><n>### Explanation<n><n>This math problem asks how much a person used to pay to refuel the tank of his plane before getting an extra gas tank to double the capacity of his fuel and how much he has to spend now to refuel his plane with a 20% increase in the cost of fuel.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>We first need to figure out the cost of fuel before changing the capacity of the fuel tank to double and the cost of fuel has increased by 20%. Here, we can conclude that the cost of fuel before getting another tank was given as a fixed figure of $200 to fill up the fuel tank.<n><n>We can also conclude that the cost of the additional fuel tank may be equivalent to the cost of the new fuel that has been increased by 20% - the original cost of the fuel. Hence the number of times $200 is going to be multiplied by 1.2 after the addition of a tank of a fixed cost amount - $x.<n><n>The new cost of the fuel will be the old cost \* 1.2x after adding up the new fuel tank.<n><n>Therefore, the new cost of the fuel after adding the new tank will be 200 * 1.2x = $480.<n><n>### Code<n><n>```python<n>#!/usr/bin/env python<n><n>import math<n><n>num1= float(input("Input: "))<n>num2= float(input("Output: "))<n><n><n>print ("output")<n><n>print( (num1*num2) )<n><n><n><n><n><n>```<n><n><n><n># 34 B<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the problem below.<n><n>Input: Mia's pet goldfish eats 4-inch-long worms.

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n>Output:		The last two choices are a bit more extreme than the first four, so perhaps the middle one is the correct answer. The way learning works best for me is if it is both a challenge and something that makes me feel smart.<n><n>Input: What is one of the biggest benefits of learning?

It seems like a bad choice might be C, for the reason that someone is allowed to study the night before a test, but the question is asking about preparing to take the test. However, it is hard to imagine how you can go longer than three weeks without studying for a test and expect to do well. Someone must study at the very least a week before the test, so the answer has to be F. The right answer might not be

NHANES is a survey administered by the National Center for Health Statistics in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has collected comprehensive health information on representative samples of Americans for over 50 years. For this study, we used survey participants ages 20-69 who did not have diabetes (n=4,660). We also restricted further analyses to subjects with 24 hr urine collections, which served as the reference standard for nutrients. We assessed calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, and choline intakes based on participant’s dietary recall interviews. Since only 25% of participants collected 24 hr urines, in order to have a sufficient number of participants with complete data for 24 hr urinary calcium and magnesium, we used a 20 min dietary recall.  Choice 1: The number of participants that collected 24 hr and 20 min urines respectively Choices:  A. 4,660 and 1,165 B. 1,169 and 1,159 C. 1,170 and 2,300 D. 2,153 and 11,328 E. 2,302 and 1,143<n>Output: D<n>

In this case, I used a recursive method for finding the answer for most of the questions. This was necessary because most of the questions would require me to calculate the answer after using some kind of logic to understand what the question was asking. For those questions in particular, I used a recursive function because it was just better suited for what I had planned to write (and there was only one test case for each question that was different, this allowed me to reuse the function I had written for the previous question). Here is the solution:<n><n>```java<n>public class Question48 {<n><n>    public static int findAverage(int arr[]) {<n><n>        if(arr.length == 0) {<n>            throw new NullPointerException("Cannot do arithmetic operations on empty array.");<n>        }<n><n>        double sum = 0;<n><n>        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {<n>            sum += arr[i];<n>        }<n><n>//        System.out.println("Original array average: " + (sum / arr.length));<n><n>        double[] arrCopy = new double[arr.length];<n>        for(int j=0; j<arr.length; j++) {<n>            arrCopy[j] = arr[j];<n>        }<n>        <n>        arrCopy = reverseArray(arrCopy);<n>    <n>        //System.out.println(Arrays.stream(arrCopy).sum());<n>        <n>        return (int)(arrCopy.length * arr[0]);<n>    }<n><n>    public static double[] reverseArray(double[] arr) {<n>        <n>        double[] rev = new double[arr[0]];<n>        <n>        for(int k=0; k<arr.length;

What is your favourite part in the passage?<n><n>The favourite part in this passage is the sentence “She does have the potential, but she is never going to achieve it.” This sentence seems to be true to me. I know some people are very potential to be successful because of their intelligence and the ability to learn things quickly, but the truth is, most of them never achieve it. <n><n>### Instructions:Complete the sentence by describing the meaning of the underlined word.<n><n>The underlined word in the sentence is “appraisal “. I think the meaning of the word “appraisal” here is evaluation, review or grading. <n>### Instruction :Complete the sentence.<n><n>1. In most companies you will get a pay raise after a ____.<n><n>The correct answer to this question is “Yearly or annually”. I think it is reasonable because in most companies, pay raise is given in annually. <n><n>#14<n><n>### Instuctions:Complete the sentence.<n>```<n>"How good was she today?"<n><n>I think the correct answer is A. The correct answer is “she wasn't good”. This is because the passage stated “The problem is that she never really tried. She knew she could get the job done, but she was so ______ about it”. The word “apathetic” in this sentence means unimpressed or not taking interest. It seems that she does the job that she was assigned only with lack of interest. If you say the girl was “OK”, it means that even though she was not good, but she was also not bad. Therefore, it does not match the meaning provided in the passage. On the other hand, “excellent” and “good” which are used in B and D do not match the description in the passage.<n><n>### Instructuions:Complete the sentence. <n>```<n>"There's no reason for that. You have __________ abilities. I just don't know how to motivate you."

Choices:  A: get angry B: concern C: worrie D: education E: learning about world<n>Output:		Answer: B<n><n>Input:Read the following passage for the next question.Scientists have discovered a way to clone human tissue using cloning from adult pig cells. It was thought to be impossible because the DNA molecule in the cell is the carrier of the genetic material. This discovery is a major breakthrough in research conducted to try to identify cures for a broad spectrum of genetic disorders.It is hoped that scientists soon will be able to create human tissue from human DNA, which will allow such things as growing a liver or kidney inside a laboratory for surgical transplantation.It was thought that an adult animal would have to be sacrificed so that the DNA molecule from the nucleus of an animal cell would be extracted and introduced into the DNA molecule of the nucleus of a cell from the body of a human being. This would theoretically lead to the development of a human clone, a biological duplicate of a living person.In fact, some scientists have used this process to produce human embryos, which they argue, is a less difficult stage to reproduce the human body cells they need for the experiment. The human DNA taken from embryos produces a human clone, which scientists hope they can then grow into an organ, say, a lung or heart, and later transplant into a recipient.It was generally thought that adult animal cells would contain DNA molecules that were too big for the nucleus of a human cell because the DNA molecules of human cells are much smaller. However, pig cells proved small enough to adapt the human DNA. In addition, the DNA molecules of many species of animals show certain similarities, which allow for the transfer from one species to another. Choices: A: It is hoped that scientists will soon be able to create human organs in laboratories. B: Scientists clone human tissue by taking it from the DNA of an adult animal cell. C: Adult animal cells would transfer to the nucleus of a large human cell. D: Scientists have found a way to clone human DNA in a laboratory.  E: Human DNA molecules can be extracted from human embryos. Output: C

There are 5 questions built into the project, but more can be added to the project with custom code to add the Question class to this **ResponseBuilder**.  Once the **ResponseBuilder** has created this **Question** and processed the question through a set of **ResponseProcessors**, it creates and returns the response.<n><n>**QuestionHandler** processes the text input from the player and will trigger when the proper input is received for the most recent question provided by the **ResponseBuilder**.<n><n>Finally, the **ResponseHandler** takes the response and parses it into an int or string (for the questions 1 through 4), a float value (for questions 5 and on), or a boolean (for question 6).<n><n>### Question Class<n><n>Every question is an instance of the **Question** class.  For each question, text is stored in the questionText field.  For questions 1, 3, 4, and 6, the player enters their answer as text and this is handled by the **ResponseBuilder.ProcessInput(String input)** function.<n><n>For question 2, a player will enter either "YES" or "NO" and it will require a float value and will be handled by the **GetResult(Question question)** function.  For question 5, a player enters a numeric answer.<n><n>For the first 5 questions of the game, it will be necessary to change the **QuestionHandler** if the questions are updated.<n><n>### ResponseBuilder Class<n><n>The **ResponseBuilders** class contains an inner class **GenericResponseBuilder** that handles all the processing of the responses.  **GenericResponseBuilder** uses the **ResponseProcessors** class to process its questions through a collection of function handlers.  The **ResponseProcessors** will take the input it received from the **Question** text and handle the following functions:<n><n>

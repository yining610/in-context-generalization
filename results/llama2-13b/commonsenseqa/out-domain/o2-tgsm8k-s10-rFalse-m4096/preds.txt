However, some of the questions are relatively long and are in the realm of an essay exam. Because of that, we decided to come up with a python script to automate the scanner and give you detailed answers directly on your browser!<n><n># Running the Python Script<n><n>In order for this program to run on a desktop, it requires a scanner with a file format of 'PDF' or 'TIFF' and also the Python interpreter (3+) to be installed. If you do not have these, you can alternatively upload an image using the Python library PIL to transform the picture into grayscale.<n><n>In order to run this program, you need to first enter in your data and images into a file with the extension 'txt', and place it in the same folder as the python file. Open command line and run the script by typing in in the terminal: python3 <python file location>.  The program generates different files (i.e. img.jpg ) in the folder location as it goes. Make sure that the folder has permission to read and write.<n><n># Description of the Program<n><n>The program works by creating thumbnail images from the pages of the image scanner. We loop through the images on the webpage and resize and scale them down to a much smaller size. The images are then cropped and stored onto a single image which has the name'scanned'. This picture is then compared to three pictures in the folder.<n><n>We have the answers to each of these questions in the form of 'correct' and 'wrong'. The 'correct' images are stored in files whose names are the numbers of the corresponding question's choices. Whenever the script finds an image that roughly fits the scanned image, the program counts through a series of choices until it finds the correct one. If a match is found, the program prints out an answer, otherwise, it repeats the same process

Choices:  A: reach tentative agreement B: suicide C: examine thing D: commit murder E: stay in bed<n>Output:		B<n><n>### Notes<n>#<n>In the first question, the total number of kilograms of nutes and dried fruits is equal to three plus two and a half = 5.5. The price per kilogram for nuts is $12 and one for dried fruits is $8. The total amount paid will be $12*$3+8*$5.5 which is equal to $90.The answer is 90<n><n>In the second question, we can solve it in a simpler way.<n><n>If John goes to gym 3 times in a week and spends an hour each day, his time spent is 3*1 which<n>equals to 3 hours. He spends 1/3 of his lifting time for lifting and cardio. Thus, 3/3*1 is equal to 1 hour<n><n>In the third question, when you hash something, it can mean to be very direct about things so it<n>could be a tentative agreement. Additionally it could mean to examine something, but it wouldn't use<n>an article like that. Therefore, it's likely to be suicide that they hash out.<n>

Please see the sample response for instruction on how to answer this question.<n><n>Input (string)<n><n>### Answer<n><n>Explanation: This question can be answered by checking the list of keywords on the website. Specifically, we are looking for the keyword of 'B'.  The word we are looking for is'recording studio'.  Here are the correct keywords on the website https://www.hint.com/kp/129646/.<n><n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following code question in Python. This question requires your understanding of Python syntaxes and control flow. Please see the sample solution for further instruction.<n><n>Input: ```<n>```<n><n>### Solution:<n>```python<n>"""HINT: A dictionary of name to age. If person is found in the dictionary, return person's age as an int. Otherwise, return -1"""<n><n>names={"Adam": 22,"John": 19,"Mary": 23,"James": 19,"Emily": 16,"Sarah": 23,"Michael":"22"}<n><n>#Code here<n>print(names["John"])<n>```<n>### Input: <n><n>### Output (int)<n><n>### Explanation: This question requires you to find the age of each person given in the list of names. The expected output for this question would be the age of each person in the list. So the output is ``` [22, 19, 23, 19, -1, -1, -23, 16, 23]```.  To accomplish this, I wrote a function ```Age()``` using a dictionary as input and then wrote ```print(names["Adam"])``` to print ```Adam```'s age as ```22```.<n><n><n>### Hint: This is the solution if you don't have time to try and code but want to know how this question can be solved. The following hint uses Python 3.x as the programming language.<n><n>### Sample input/output<n><n>### HINT: If a person is not found in the dictionary, the function Age() returns the number of elements in the input dictionary's key as described in Python 3.x's

Choices:  D,Oxygen,Air D;Oxygen;Air;Earth Ozone Layer:The ozone layer is a layer in Earth's atmosphere which contains relatively high concentrations of ozone molecules. This layer absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet light, which otherwise would potentially damage life forms on Earth. The layer contains high amounts of ozone because the electromagnetic radiation from the sun is absorbed by oxygen molecules at the levels above the troposphere and some absorbs energy to create ozone molecules. The ozone layer is essentially absorbing energy from the sun and creating ozone. The ozone layer also absorbs energy from cosmic radiation originating from a point called the South Atlantic Anomaly. There’s a hole in the ozone layer that's over the South Pole every winter. Some people call it the "ozone hole." It's an area of extreme high-level ozone loss that appears at certain times of the year. The loss of this layer means that a greater concentration of the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation can reach Earth’s surface. <n>Output: E<n><n>Input:The term _____________ describes what happens when new organisms evolve that are able to better use their environment.

You also know how to enter answers that are multi-digit numbers (like the weightlifting problem) and understand sentence problems as well (like the gym problem).<n><n>The first problem is your regular "multiple choice" problem: you are given a few choices of answers and you just need to pick the one you think is right from the list of provided answers.

The answer to this is also obvious and I will let you pick it up.<n><n>The final problem is a "reading comprehension" where you have to identify a part of speech from words in a sentence. For example, "they launch a suprise attack" uses attack as a verb, ends as a conjunction, and attack as a noun. The correct answer is a part of speech (verb, conjunction, noun, etc.).<n><n>You should be able to pass this after you have read through all of the material.

And why is a function important?"<n><n>### Answer:Functions are a mathematical idea that has been applied to a wide range of disciplines. Some important characteristics of the function may give us the answer, The first is that it is a set that assigns a value to each element of that set. Another defining characteristic is that each value has a corresponding value of the function. Let f(x) (x is the variable) equal y (y is the output). We say if X = y. In order to calculate the desired output, any value x is entered into the function and the desired output is generated. <n>### Question Answer Answered:Answer the above instruction<n>### Answer:A function maps each element of one set to an element of a second set. In math if a function is described is a rule or process, you use it to make or create something else. Ex: The function “y=2” means that, on a coordinate plane the output value will always be equal to the input value + 2. <n>### Assessment:Answer the following instruction:<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>### Note:You must answer all the question<n><n>### Question:What do the following statements mean?<n><n>### Instructor: What is a function<n><n>### AnswerThe function states that as long as x is equal to 2, then y is equal to 4.<n>### AnswerIt states that y is equal to 2 if x is 3.<n>### AnswerThe funtion state y = 4 if x equals 2.<n><n>### AnswerIt stattes that x will always be equal to 4.

I was able to answer this on the test by reading the question very carefully. I think there was a typo.  (56*kg)(9*pizzas)=4768kg. This is 4760 kg = 4.76 tonnes of dough. But 96*4=(96*2)/2=384. This is 3.84 tonnes of dough per 1000 pizzas. So this is 2/3 inefficient. <n><n>In questions 2 and 3 what the questions is asking for is how efficient the time or amount spent doing an action is to your end goal or the effectiveness of your actions.

Choices:  A: get money B: pay money C: go shopping D: lose money E: save money<n>Output:		D<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>First, read the description the instruction and the question. In programming we should try to identify what the problem is and what kind of operation is needed before starting our codes.<n><n>For the first question about Adam bought 3 kilogram of nuts and 5 kilogram of dried fruits. First we should identify the 3 variables in which we can use as a container for the inputs and the operation is to multiply $12 by 3 to get the value of nuts is $36. The second step is to use $8 to mulitply with 5 to get the value of dried fruits is $40. Adding together $36 and $40 we get $76 which is the value of his purchases. Then put your answer into the output box.<n><n>For the second question, Johns goes to the three time a week which means the frequency of visits is 3. Now we can put the number 3 in the frequency of visits and use the value $1 for an hour multiply by 3, we will get 3 which means he spends at the gym for 3 hours a week. Write your answer on the output box.<n>

The fossil contained many unique aspects that proved conclusively that ancient life forms existed much earlier than previous studies would suggest. In the journal, **PNAS**, the scientists described their findings. These findings included new evidence for the earliest modern animal phylum, the worm-like Lophotrochozoa. They also contained the oldest known fossil evidence of a jawless vertebrate and the oldest known example of a deuterostome, which is related to echinoderms( starfish, sea stars).<n><n><n><n><n><n>The authors said,”Although these specimens do not provide conclusive evidence for the earliest life forms” these fossils do include the oldest known forms of some of the major animal groups for which we find representatives today.”<n><n>**Prompt**: According to this passage, all of the following statements are true EXCEPT:<n><n>1. The fossil discovered by the researchers was of an extinct life form.<n>2. The fossil was found in an unusual location.<n>3. The fossil was the first to show that the first animals were more than one cell.<n>4.

Choices:  A: plain B: cold C: dull D: bad E: wet<n>Output:		Bad (If the above clouds are thunderhead clouds.)<n><n>**Hint:**You should refer to the python dictionary  and list  functions to get the answer.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>**Apparently there are a few ways of solving this problem. We will present two here. **<n><n>  1. Use the **dict methods**<n>  <n>  This is by far the easier solution, as there is much less code to write. Python dict methods are the go-to method for most people, so they will have most of the necessary functions memorized.<n>  <n>  ```<n>  import operator<n>  <n>  def main():<n>  	d = dict()<n>  	d['A'] = 4<n>  	d['B'] = 6<n>  	d['C'] = 8<n>  	d['D'] = 2<n>  	d['E'] = 4<n>      ans = int(reduce(operator.mul, list(d.keys()))) <n>      print(ans)<n>  main()<n>  ```<n>  <n>  **What do we do here**<n>  <n>  - First we build a dictionary that tells us the number <n>  of options each question has to match. For example, the<n>  first has three choices,  the second has just 2, and  the <n>  third has 5.<n>  - Next, we `use` python `dictionary method** to get all the keys into a list.<n>  - Finally, we make reduce to multiply the `answers` into the `values`<n>  in the list.<n>  <n>  1. Use **nested comprehension with list methods:**<n>  The approach above uses the `reduce` function that is only available in Python 3. For some of us, it will be very foreign to us. This is a way to do the exact same thing in Python 2.x<n><n>  ```<n>  imports = ['cloud','gum','list']<n>  imports= {'plain' : 2,<n>           'cloud': 1,<n>           'cold' : 2}<n>  import operator<n>  def main():    <n>      ans = int(''.join((x * '0' if x == '0' or x < '0' else '' for <n>             x in map(int, filter(None, [''.join(str(z)

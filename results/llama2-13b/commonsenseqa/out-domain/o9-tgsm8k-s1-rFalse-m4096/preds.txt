Choices:  A: hospital B: head C: sick person D: elderly person E: doctor's office<n>Output:		A<n><n># Tutoring<n>## What is a word problem?<n>Word problems require  the knowledge and strategies of arithmetic operations as well as an understanding of the meaning of words. <n>Word problems may ask students to identify missing numbers in a sum or difference situation.<n>Word problems may call on students to understand rate of change, multiplication and  division as they work with problems asking for missing quantities. <n>Questions asking students to interpret word problems may require them to know how to calculate area, perimeter, length or some other measure.<n>For example, say your teacher asks "How much paper is used to cover this floor? What must be determined? How many floor squares fit into a piece of paper? <n>What operation is used?  How much does it cost?<n><n>### Ways to simplify word problems<n>**Try to break the problem into component parts**.  For instance, "Dave baked and ate 1/8 of a 10 pound pie." <n>What do you know? <n>You know that 1/8 of the pie is a piece of pie and that it cost Dave 1/10 of the pie.  This problem is not too difficult because Dave ate 1/5 of the pie and the pie weighed ten pounds. <n>**Reexamine the word problem**.  To determine the length of the river, first determine the size of the river and then determine its depth.  To find the depth, multiply the width by 6.  Therefore, the length is 540 feet.<n>**Make the problem more concrete to help the student better grasp the problem**.  For example, a student may be given the problem "If 400 gallons of paint can be used on 3 buildings at 2 hours, how much can be used on one building in five hours?"  <n>The problem can be presented differently:  A man wants to paint his barn in five hours.  If it takes six hours to paint a roof and three hours to paint a garage,  how many hours does it take to paint the barn? <n><n># Ways to solve word problems<n>**Understand the different ways in which a problem can be expressed in word problem**.   For example, an expression such as "2x + 3" can be expressed algebraically as "2x = 3 + x" or "x +

Too many students just write down all of the given facts without understanding what to do with them or what the answer would look like. It is a common problem that many 7th grade students encounter—they don’t understand the connection between the question being asked and the answer being sought. The challenge is getting them to look beyond the immediate facts and consider what would happen instead.<n><n>### Question Answer:<n><n>Output: A, This question tests a 7th grader's understanding of division with remainders. 7th grade is the first time that multiple numbers can be involved in division and the resulting answer will have a remainder. If the student is unable to recognize their work will need to have that division carry over into another number then the student will struggle in algebra. This is a question about the student's understanding that the numbers don't end. It tests a student's understanding about the number system as well as their ability to recognize that they don't know how to answer a question yet. <n>  <n>

Overall, it went great and the majority of the questions asked were pretty common, straight forward, relatively easy questions. For those unfamiliar with an "interviewing lens", these are sets of online coding platforms to practice a programming language's typical interview questions to help students prepare and practice before any future interviewing process. In the case of Python, the main platform I found on Amazon is Python Lens while there are other platforms such as Leetcode for specific programming solutions.<n><n>Overall, my results are satisfactory at this time as I was able to get all the answers correctly. However, there is only one section that I struggled with in which was the logic puzzles I have shared as I need to improve upon my logic and reasoning skills. <n><n>### Resources<n><n>The main references I used were the Leetcode Problem Solver and Coursera's Algorithms and Data Structures Course. The reason I am mentioning these two as they helped me to learn Python fundamentals and the algorithms and data structures most important in coding as well as to help me find the solutions to certain problems I had in coding prior to this coding interview.<n>

In this lesson, we'll be doing the same set of problems for multiple weeks, but use a different format depending on the week.  Sometimes, the questions we'll have will be multiple choice, and sometimes they'll be word problems.<n><n>### Objectives: By the end of this class you should be able to<n><n>- Solve for the unknown variable in multiple choice problems that ask for the same operation to be done to each number within the problem except for the variable<n><n>---<n><n>### What's the question? <n><n>The question is "Which operation do I need to do to find this variable?  Do I need to add or do I need to subtract?"<n><n>---<n><n>When you're solving for a variable, and the problem describes a different operation that needs to happen to different numbers throughout the problem, except for the variable<n>- You're going to have to do that same operation to all of the other numbers, except for your variable, in order to find the variable<n>- If you do that operation, and your variable makes a number larger, it's a subtract<n>- If you do the operation, and your variable make the number smaller, it needs to be an add<n>- So, if we take all of those numbers over there, we've got 7 + 3 = X, and then we also have 8 + 2 = X<n>- Well, if we do 7 + 3, it's not going to make this 10 larger since we're already at 10.  <n>- Therefore, we've got to subtract<n>- If we did 3 - 7, it would've made it smaller, so we've gotta add<n>- If you go 8 + 2 makes it even bigger.  So, I've got to do<n>- Anything I do here, it should be an add, because it'll make it bigger<n>- Anything over here, you'd have to do the opposite, since it'd be smaller<n><n>### How to find the correct path in between weeks<n><n>When deciding to do either multiple choice quizzes or word problems, students can use last week's quiz

Converting Mary to an integer is necessary because she's a human and humans have fractions, thus making it harder to calculate her stickers. The first line converts the total amount of stickers Mary has, 89, into an integer.<n><n>### Next we have our large stickers. We want to use these stickers to cover the first page of journal that is front so we want the amount of large stickers to be multiplied by the number of front page journal and assigned to the variable that is 'front' in this case, using the asterisk symbol *<n><n>In this case, the amount of large sticklers is 3. The number of sticklers on the front page however, is 1. We subtract out the following line. We can see that the result is in negative which is correct.<n><n>### Then we have the medium sticklers. We want to use this to paste 7 sticklers on 6 pages, therefore we need to keep multiplying the number of medium sticklers (which are 7), by the number of pages that we want to paste the sticklers on +1, which is 6 + 1. What we are adding here is an extra page for the last page that can be pasted with a medium sticker. We assign that amount to the variable 'page'.<n><n>### Then, we subtract out the 7 * 6 + 1 result and assign it to a variable, which is 'page'.<n><n>We can see that there is the amount of medium sticklers remaining in the first page and then the amount of it left from the last page. We subtract the first from the second to get the amount of medium stickers remaining.<n><n>## Lastly we can add them together to get the answer.<n><n>## Question 2<n><n>## Answer: Zach needs $6 more<n><n>```python<n># Convert total allowance

For example with the first prompt it states that Mary had 89, and 3 large stickers is one of the choices for the first part of the output. Therefore the correct choice for the output is A: 12(44-76) = 44<n><n>We can see this same strategy with the prompts that follow.<n><n>The first three use multiple inputs from the question along with a single input from the previous question.  The fourth statement uses two of the inputs but does not have the input of previous input so it can be solved using the information above.<n>After question four, the next three questions are a slight variation of a similar question.<n><n>The output values for the last three questions appear to make more sense if you follow the logic above which leads me to believe that the order in which these input/outputs are provided is by chance.<n><n>### Feedback:<n><n>I would recommend to provide some sort of answer key when making similar challenges. I was unable to make much progress on this one because of the lack of answer key until the end making progress rather slow.<n>

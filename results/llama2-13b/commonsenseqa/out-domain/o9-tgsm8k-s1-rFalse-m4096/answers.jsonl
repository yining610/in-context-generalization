What must be determined? How many floor squares fit into a piece of paper? \nWhat operation is used?  How much does it cost?\n\n### Ways to simplify word problems\n**Try to break the problem into component parts**.  For instance, \"Dave baked and ate 1/8 of a 10 pound pie.\" \nWhat do you know? \nYou know that 1/8 of the pie is a piece of pie and that it cost Dave 1/10 of the pie.  This problem is not too difficult because Dave ate 1/5 of the pie and the pie weighed ten pounds. \n**Reexamine the word problem**.  To determine the length of the river, first determine the size of the river and then determine its depth.  To find the depth, multiply the width by 6.  Therefore, the length is 540 feet.\n**Make the problem more concrete to help the student better grasp the problem**.  For example, a student may be given the problem \"If 400 gallons of paint can be used on 3 buildings at 2 hours, how much can be used on one building in five hours?\"  \nThe problem can be presented differently:  A man wants to paint his barn in five hours.  If it takes six hours to paint a roof and three hours to paint a garage,  how many hours does it take to paint the barn? \n\n# Ways to solve word problems\n**Understand the different ways in which a problem can be expressed in word problem**.   For example, an expression such as \"2x + 3\" can be expressed algebraically as \"2x = 3 + x\" or \"x +", "answer": "D: elderly person"}

A table\n##### b. A room\n##### c. A football field\n##### d. A bookcase\n\n# Answer: (c)\n##### a. Perimeter of a table \n\nThe table will have 4 sides like 1 side of a square. \nIf you have 2 sides of each table, you would get a value of 4 times 2. \n\nSo, 4 * 2 would be 8. \n##### b. Perimeter of a room \n\nIf you add the length and the width of a room, you would get that perimeter. \n\n##### c. Perimeter of a football field \n\nYou will need to calculate the perimeters of a rectangular shape. \n\nThe length of the field would be 80 yards and the width of the field would be also 80 yards. \n\nSo you have 160 yards of perimeter. \n##### d. Perimeter of a bookcase \n\nThe length is 0.5 m and the width is 1.5 meters. \n\nThe area would be 2 * 1.5 = 3, but you should not calculate the area of a bookcase, but its perimeter. \nSo 3 + 2 = 5 for the perimeter of the length and the width. \n#####\n\n**Explanation 1:**\n\nFor this question, you will need the right unit that measures distance. \nYou will then be able to calculate the perimeter value for each image. \nThe answers will be in meters in the first and second image, but the meters are equivalent to the yards for the second and third images.", "answer": "D: garage"}

Overall, it went great and the majority of the questions asked were pretty common, straight forward, relatively easy questions. For those unfamiliar with an \"interviewing lens\", these are sets of online coding platforms to practice a programming language's typical interview questions to help students prepare and practice before any future interviewing process. In the case of Python, the main platform I found on Amazon is Python Lens while there are other platforms such as Leetcode for specific programming solutions.\n\nOverall, my results are satisfactory at this time as I was able to get all the answers correctly. However, there is only one section that I struggled with in which was the logic puzzles I have shared as I need to improve upon my logic and reasoning skills. \n\n### Resources\n\nThe main references I used were the Leetcode Problem Solver and Coursera's Algorithms and Data Structures Course. The reason I am mentioning these two as they helped me to learn Python fundamentals and the algorithms and data structures most important in coding as well as to help me find the solutions to certain problems I had in coding prior to this coding interview.", "answer": "A: good health"}

In this lesson, we'll be doing the same set of problems for multiple weeks, but use a different format depending on the week.  Sometimes, the questions we'll have will be multiple choice, and sometimes they'll be word problems.\n\n### Objectives: By the end of this class you should be able to\n\n- Solve for the unknown variable in multiple choice problems that ask for the same operation to be done to each number within the problem except for the variable\n\n---\n\n### What's the question? \n\nThe question is \"Which operation do I need to do to find this variable?  Do I need to add or do I need to subtract?\"\n\n---\n\nWhen you're solving for a variable, and the problem describes a different operation that needs to happen to different numbers throughout the problem, except for the variable\n- You're going to have to do that same operation to all of the other numbers, except for your variable, in order to find the variable\n- If you do that operation, and your variable makes a number larger, it's a subtract\n- If you do the operation, and your variable make the number smaller, it needs to be an add\n- So, if we take all of those numbers over there, we've got 7 + 3 = X, and then we also have 8 + 2 = X\n- Well, if we do 7 + 3, it's not going to make this 10 larger since we're already at 10.  \n- Therefore, we've got to subtract\n- If we did 3 - 7, it would've made it smaller, so we've gotta add\n- If you go 8 + 2 makes it even bigger.  So, I've got to do\n- Anything I do here, it should be an add, because it'll make it bigger\n- Anything over here, you'd have to do the opposite, since it'd be smaller\n\n### How to find the correct path in between weeks\n\nWhen deciding to do either multiple choice quizzes or word problems, students can use last week's quiz", "answer": "B: container"}

{"idx": 365, "text": "B\n\n# Question 1\n\n## Answer: Mary has 44 stickers remaining\n\n```python\n>>> mary = 89\n>>> large = 3\n>>> medium = 7\n>>> page = 6\n>>> stickers = mary - (large * page) - (medium * (page + 1))\n>>> stickers\n44\n```\n\n## Detailed explanation:\n\n### Let's first convert the stickers to an integer using int(). Converting Mary to an integer is necessary because she's a human and humans have fractions, thus making it harder to calculate her stickers. The first line converts the total amount of stickers Mary has, 89, into an integer.\n\n### Next we have our large stickers. We want to use these stickers to cover the first page of journal that is front so we want the amount of large stickers to be multiplied by the number of front page journal and assigned to the variable that is 'front' in this case, using the asterisk symbol *\n\nIn this case, the amount of large sticklers is 3. The number of sticklers on the front page however, is 1. We subtract out the following line. We can see that the result is in negative which is correct.\n\n### Then we have the medium sticklers. We want to use this to paste 7 sticklers on 6 pages, therefore we need to keep multiplying the number of medium sticklers (which are 7), by the number of pages that we want to paste the sticklers on +1, which is 6 + 1. What we are adding here is an extra page for the last page that can be pasted with a medium sticker. We assign that amount to the variable 'page'.\n\n### Then, we subtract out the 7 * 6 + 1 result and assign it to a variable, which is 'page'.\n\nWe can see that there is the amount of medium sticklers remaining in the first page and then the amount of it left from the last page. We subtract the first from the second to get the amount of medium stickers remaining.\n\n## Lastly we can add them together to get the answer.\n\n## Question 2\n\n## Answer: Zach needs $6 more\n\n```python\n# Convert total allowance", "answer": "C: blacksmith's shop"}

This problem is about a group of stickers which have been divided among 9 pages of Mary's journal.\nWe are given four variables namely s for the initial number of stickers left by Mary before using as well as the 3 large stickers\n(s3) on the front page of the journal, 7 small stickers on each of 6 other pages (s7*6).\nWe are further given a 5-digit number 89 which is not a multiple of 3 and\n7, which is a multiple of 7.\n\nSo, we know s3+6s7=89, which implies that [s3+6s7-89]=0. The right-hand side is\nmultiples of 7, and so the left-hand side must be zero:\ns3+6s-44 =0. We then know s=44. \n\n2.

It is not necessary to spend time perfecting the formatting of your code.\n\nKeep your solution code within the ```test_case``` section of your notebook. You should be able to run your entire solution by running ```python -m pytest test_case.py``` (on a mac, you may need to use ```sudo python3 -m pytest test.py```) without any further input. **There is a maximum of 6 seconds between each question, so make sure to wait until all your tests pass before you move to the next one.**\n\nIf your solution contains ```print``` statements, please set them to ```False\"``` by adding ```print(False, *args, **kwargs)```.\n\nPlease avoid ```-m pytest -v``` or any other such flags; it should be enough to leave the notebook open in a terminal window while you work. Tests that fail for any reason could be flagged as failing automatically for you.\n\n#### Explanations\n\nIn order for your code to receive full credit, it must run all of the tests without any error messages. **No partial credit** will be given. **There will be no curve.**  In addition, some explanations to justify the outputs is required as described below in more detail.\n\n#### How to pass:\n\nWrite python code to pass each test individually in the ```test_case.py``` file as shown in the example below.\n\n```python\nfrom test_case import *\n\ndef answer(a_str):\n    # write your code here\n    # raise your assert statements here or if, else etc\n\na_str = \"Jason\"\nanswer(a_str)\nassert check_answers(a_str, 44)\n\nassert check_answer_explanation(a_str, \"We can calculate his remaining stickers by subtracting the total 86 sticker used from the initially given sticker. 86-89 =", "answer": "B: create art"}

So, its management decided to organize events for its customers to improve loyalty to each other. Therefore, the number of customers that attended the event is determined. It is known that on average 33% of customers are male, the average age of 47 years and 17% of them are regular customers. The total number of events is not fixed yet and <n>management has no experience, so there is uncertainty regarding how many customers will turn up at the event. The company can be <n>sure that 5% of the female customer will attend, 6% of 45 year old customers, 45% of the male customers and 19% of the people who <n>attend the event regularly. Each customer who attends these events will pay $100. Therefore, the average spend per customer is  <n>$100/3 = $33.33 or $33 for every customer who will turn up. It will be great if 900 customers turn up, however the management is not <n>very hopeful, as more than 900 people would be disappointed if the event has limited capacity.

Returns what the function returns.<n><n>Example -  `output(lambda: 5 - 3)` returns 2.<n> <n>Explanation: Lambda works like an anonymous function, it's a shortcut for function definition. Lambda can take any number of arguments, and you can call a lambda without defining it or using it in a larger context.<n> <n>Ex: `output(lambda:1 + input("Enter Value: "))` can add the value entered by the user to its result and assigns the answer to what is returned by the lambda (in this case, 1).<n> <n>`output` is defined as `def output(f): return f()`, so when you pass a function to it, you're asking the function itself to become its own result.

Unfortunately, the question doesn't really fit this site. It is really an interview question, asking you to solve math and English related problems. It is only vaguely related to code, and I believe any answerer would just give you code to do those things without critiquing the code. In short, Code Review is for reviews of **working** code. Do you have any programming questions, e.g. for code you have written? Otherwise, you might be better off on programmers.stackexchange.<n><n>Comment: Thank you, @JonHarper, I'm very sorry and I probably won't be taking the test on that place, and yeah, I'm aware it doesn't really fit, but I actually didn't find those questions, but I just wanted to show you what kinda question my recruiter will most likely give to me.

Choices:  A: bookstore B: library C: doctor D: home E: table<n>Output:		D<n><n><n>### How is the model trained?<n>Training the model involves loading the data set and calling the model to fit on it. Then, it will generate a prediction score for each question in the testing data set.<n><n>For example, when we were training the model, we were given the training data set,  questions in our training file. The training data set contains multiple questions that were fed into the model. Then, we would call the model to train itself and the model itself would look for multiple answers that were generated by a dataset called the huggingface corpus dataset which had multiple answers from questions that have similar context to our input question. Then, it would predict the answer which it learned to generate from the huggingface training set as our answer for our input question.<n><n><n><n>### Why does it work for some questions and not others? How can you expand your model to make it answer all the questions correctly?<n>The output that we get from running a machine learning model on a dataset is only as good as the input. In other words, it is impossible for a model to make predictions for data sets that are not included in the training set. Since the huggingface datasets that we trained and loaded our model on may not have had input questions that directly map to our questions. It may be possible for our model to make predictions for other questions that are not included in this dataset. However, it should still be able to perform well on questions that are similar to ours as long as they are included in the dataset. <n><n>The model that we are providing will return output predictions based on the training data set that it was trained on when given input data. Thus, our model will only be able to make predictions based on the data that it was trained on.<n>

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: 30<n><n>Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water.

The number of kilograms of nutes (n) is known from its amount which the number of kilograms fo dry fruits (d) <n><n>In other words: _ n+ d  =  3+2.5_<n><n>and the following is true: _ n+d = 30_<n><n>The first step will be figuring out how many kilograms of nute and dry fruits should cost?<n><n>The most likely choice will be: _ $$20 n + 15 d$$_<n><n>Its a linear equation for n and d, so its a simple math to solve.<n><n>And the number of kilogram's he bought is: <n>_ <n>$$56$$_<n><n><n><n>### Question B:<n><n>We can solve this problem using number theory. In fact, it's not difficult to calculate, as we can just observe that he performs three lifts for a week, which means that  0.67 hours of weight lift is performed per day.<n><n>Thus, 0.67 hours x 7 days = 4.82 hours per week or 4 hours.<n><n><n><n><n>## Question C:<n><n>The solution to this problem is not simple.<n><n>This problem assumes that the person who wants to calculate how much it costs to refuel the plane needs to buy more of the new fuel tank which is priced at 50% cheaper.<n><n>And here we do not mention that it was the volume of fuel used for each tank which was in question in the first place. Thus, how can we calculate it? The formula for volumne is length*breadth*height. We also know that the volume is 200 * 0.2 = 40 litres. Let's say that we want to double volume. <n>Then it will be 40*2 = 80 liters. And because that tank is 50% smaller, then 80*

Use single line comments with a comment only when necessary <n><n>### - A good example of readable code is given below:<n><n>```python<n>i = 0<n>while(i < 3):<n>    j = 4<n>    k = 12<n>    if j > k:<n>        print("The values are swapped")<n>    elif k >= j:<n>        k = k - 1<n>        print("Decreasing value of k")<n>    else:<n>        print("Reach k = 0, breaking loop")<n>        break<n>```<n><n>-		A not so readable code example for reference<n><n>```python<n>def print_line(num, message):<n>    if num < message.find("="):<n>        num = num<n>        message = "=" * num + message + "="<n>    lines = []<n>    while num < len(message):<n>        lines.append(message[num:num + 2])<n>        num += 2<n>    return "".join(lines)<n><n>def print_(message: str, n0: int = 2, n1: int = 1, n2: int = 1) -> None:<n>    print(print_line(n0, message))<n>    print(print(print_line(2 * n1, ""), "\n"), f"{n0} {n1} = {n1}")<n><n>def print__(message: str, spaceNum: int = 2 ** -12) -> None:<n>```<n><n><n>### 6. Modularity<n>- Modular design in programming is when you break a computer program up into multiple distinct sections, each doing a relatively simple job. (source: StackOverlow)<n>-	The sections have to have well defined input and output interfaces so that they can work together.<n><n><n>### Question (1):<n>For example, the following code contains 2 modules.<n><n>```Python

We use **Cross Fit**, the fitness club franchise as test data for predicting the number of hours per week in the gym and **NFL** for number of goals scored against the top team. The remaining data set is from a restaurant inventory management system. We apply machine learning algorithms to predict the cost of the purchases made by a customer and the number of eggs produced by a chicken.<n>We use 7 machine learning algorithms, viz. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting regressor, K-NN, Linear regression, Logistic Regression and Support vector machine regressor for our experiments.<n><n>### 1. Introduction<n><n>The machine learning algorithms were implemented in Python using the **scikit-learn** library. <n>To make predictions for the datasets, we utilized the following two Python libraries, **pandas** and **sklearn**, which can be used for manipulating structured data, and performing predictive analytics, respectively.<n><n>**pandas** is mainly used in the exploratory data analysis phase, where, we will be using this library to load the datasets into the machine learning environment.<n><n>**sklearn** is mainly used in performing the actual predictions by using the  different learning algorithms. This is done using **sklearn.modelSelection** module, which is a built-in package that comes along with the **sklearn** package, and supports the use of different machine learning algorithms. After we have set up the machine learning environment and got all the predictions, we will visualize them using the different plots in **matplotlib**. We used the built-in matplotlib package **matplotlib.pyplot** to visualize the results.<n><n>### Input<n><n>The dataset used in this project has a total data size of 20,038 records.

Choices:  A: bookstore B: building C: meeting D: office E: coffeehouse<n>Output:		Office<n><n>### What do you need to be able to answer?<n><n>You must be able to calculate percentages.  For that, we'll be learning about ratios. A ratio tells that there are $n$ of part 1 to 1 part part 2, and part 2 to 1 part part $n+1$.  Ratio can then be calculated by $(n+1)/n$.  To reverse one, calculate the opposite of 1 part of part 1 and make it equal to part $n$.  The answer will be $n/n+1$.<n><n>There are several ways to solve problems.  The best way is to keep a look out on the units, so you can calculate the answer.<n><n>### Link:<n><n>[Try it in the editor](http://sandbox.educational.games/p5js/?edit=p5js-HdFK)<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>- Copy/Paste and play the instructions in the editor.

The store she wants to go to has two different choices. The price of sofa A is $200 more than the price of sofa B however if she buys sofa B she will have to spend another $140 on cushions but sofa A already come with cushions.<n>What price difference between sofas is enough information?<n>(E) $55<n> <n>##### Good explanation:<n><n>A store that offers sofa at the right price only will not make a profit. Therefore, the store will definitely charge the price of sofa.<n><n>##### Another Explanation<n><n>To find this price difference, we can assume that A is 10x less than B, 10x means 10 times cheaper than B, since A comes with cushion and if we buy B we spend more in 140$ just for cushion, so basically A is cheaper than 10x B + 140$. So we can get B by 140/10 = 14, so to make A 10 times cheeper then B we just can take 10x 14 - 140 or (14x 9) - 140 = 116 -140 = - 24 which makes the difference between 2 sofas 200 - 24 = 176$<n>

John plays video games. He likes to play 1 hour a day. If a second costs $0.01, find out how much John pays in a day, and a week, to play video games. Assume 7 days a week.<n>Output: 14400/365<n><n>Output: $1.<n><n>First, find how many seconds play video games in a week. One hour is 3600 seconds, a day is 24 hours.  So, the amount of time spend playing video games in a day is 360 times 24 hours. In a week, that would be:<n><n>360 * 24 * 7 = 331200 seconds<n><n>That means he spends $331.20 to play video games in a day, and $1093.84 a week.<n><n>2. On a particular day, the total number of tickets for theater A and theater B sold was the same. However, the total amount of ticket sale in theater A was lesser than theater B by $150.

This includes skills like using loops to calculate total number of inputs and using conditional statements to check inputs.<n>- In our case, this is a very basic question. You need to use a simple `int` input to get the amount of food item you are asked. `int` stands for \_integer_ \_type_\_.<n><n>- Next we can use a loop with the variable `i` to get multiple values for your question. For example, in our case, you asked us to input 3 kilograms. That means you need to ask for that many inputs:<n>    - The first input of 3 kilograms would be the answer of question 1.<n>    - The second input of 2.5 kilogram would be the answer of the second question.<n><n>- To use those loop 4 times, the correct answer would be:<n><n>``` Python<n>kilograms = [int(input("How much kilogram of {} do you buy today?".format(item)))) \<n>for item in ['Nuts','Dried Fruits']<n><n>howMuchDidItCost = 0<n><n>for i, kilogram in enumerate(kilograms):<n>	print("Answer of {} is : {}".format(items[i],kilogram))<n>	howMuchDidItcost = howMuchDidItcost + 12<n><n>print("The Total cost of your purchases is $:{}".format(howMuchDidItCast))<n>```<n><n>- And run this to get your correct solution.<n><n>For the next 4 questions, do the same thing again. You may change a little bit of the syntax and the way you used the loop, but follow the same logic. And the above code should help you a lot if you are new in Python.<n>

Inference and conjecture<n>2. Proof and proof by contradiction<n>3. Proof and proof by induction<n>4. Conjecture and definition<n>### Part 2: Write the two steps for the following <n>- Proof by mathematical induction<n>- Proof by contrapositive<n>### Solution:In your own words define the two terms:<n><n>-A conjecture is in the mathematical community. It is an assumption based on observed properties of a mathematical structure without proof. In other words, one can deduce if a conjecture holds in a case or two.<n><n>-A definition is a statement that defines a term that is used in a math problem. You use a definition like you would when you define a word in the English Language. The definition of a specific math term is a statement by which you can prove that a specific object matches the definition through properties.<n><n>1.Inference is a guess, or a theory as to why something may be true. For example, given the premise that the sky is blue, an assumption could be made inferring that it is the sun's rays causing the sky to appear that color. However, this assumption would lack proof, therefore the inference would not be accepted scientifically. <n><n>2.Contrary to inference, conjecture is a statement of the proof of an assumption, or statement of facts. The statement is taken to be true and accepted as true until otherwise proven to be false. However, there may be assumptions that are not fully accepted and are taken to be true for the time being. <n><n>3.A proof by contradiction is when you can prove that a statement is true given that the opposite of the truth cannot exist. Let's take the following example: If a triangle has no side greater than 3. This cannot work. A triangle has three

This assignment is to give you an opportunity to practice:\n\n>  * using arrays to solve a problem from Scenarios\n>  * using basic data structures (such as arrays, maps, strings, etc.) to understand and solve computational problems, i.e., problems about processes or computations. You\u2019ve hopefully been solving computational problems throughout your coursework at Cal.\n>  * using data structures to store data to be processed, manipulated, or used\n\n### Scenario 1:\n\n1. We have an array `colors` and you want to remove an element from the array, then reorder the elements so the remaining elements shift up as that element is removed. \n\n**Explanation**: This is the simplest example of when you might want to remove an element and use the array to remember where the other elements have moved so you can recreate the array. \n\n**Code**: You should end up with this function definition:\n\n```ruby\ndef reorder_array!(colors, position, element)\n```\n\n2. You\u2019re removing the green element from the previous array, and the resulting array is:\n\n```ruby \ncolors = [\"blue\", \"gray\", \"green\", \"red\"]\n```\n\nYou do not need to change the colors array yourself. Instead, use the array as an additional helper variable. \n\n3. You should return an array `new_array` with a single element in it (the blue element):\n\n```ruby\n    new_array = [\"blue\"]\n```\n\n4. You can change the color array to `blue` afterwards. \n\n**Example**:\n\n\n\n```ruby\ncolors = [\"blue\",\"gray\",\"green\",\"red\"]\nnew_arr = [\"blue\"]\nputs new_array \n#=> [\"blue\"]\n``` \n\n**Bonus:** You now should understand how to use", "answer": "C: orchestra"}

{"idx": 137, "text": "B\n\nInput: If a 290 lb man sits on a bench that is 18 inches long, how much will the bench drop?\nOutput: 0.25 in\n\n##### Explanation:\nThe question is trying to teach me how to work with scaled units.  A pound (lb.) is 0.4536 kg.  18 inches is 0.46 meters.   0.46 / 0.454 is 0.996.\n\nSo the bench gets 0.460 kg = 4.536 X 0.995 (0.45 X 0.95) = 4.4985 kg.  Then 290 lb. is 130.2 kg.  4.498 kg  + 130.4 kg is 134.88 kg.  That is 1348800 g, or 1348.8 mg,  or 134.9 g, or 0.135 kg.  Since we are measuring change over time, the man's weight does not change (ignoring the change associated with sitting), so the man's weight change is 0.\n\nThus the bench drops 0.134 kg - 0.130 kg = 0.004 kg = 0.4 kg.  Or 50 milligrams, or 500000 micrograms\n\nExplanation 2, just ignoring the weight of the man: 290 lb (131.5428635 kg) times 0.18 (18/100) is: 47.6142863 kg.   Since 18 inches is 46 cm, 47.62 cm is the total height of the bench.  So 18 inches is -47.6 cm, or -0.476 cm.\n\n##### Instructions:Answer the following multiple chioce question.\n\nInput : Which of the following is an example of a chemical change?\n    Choices:\n  A. water into water v", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}

{"idx": 160, "text": "D\n\n##### Instruction: Answer every question below.\n\nThe number of different pizza topping combinations is huge. Calculate the number of pizzas that can be ordered using combinations of the following toppings.\n\n\n1. Anchovies\n2. Bacon\n3. Bell Pepper\n4. Hot pepper\n5. Mushrooms\nTo order a pizza, put the toppings in the order the pizza will be delivered.\n\nFor example, an order of \u201cB, A\u201d will result in Bacon delivered first and then anchovies.  Pizza ordered using this method may have multiple flavors of \u201cB\u201d and/or \u201cA\u201d on the same pizza. The sequence and order matter. However, the placement of the toppings on the pizza (top or bottom of the pie) is irrelevant. In a similar example, an order of A, B, means the pizza would be topped with a single layer of anchovies, bacon,and then a layer of both toppings.\n\nOrder \u201cB, A, B\u201d is equivalent to \u201cA, B, A, B.\u201d\n\nAll combinations have the possibility of being ordered.  For example, the topping combination of Pizza:B, B, A, A, B, A, is possible. The same pizza can be ordered as B, B, A, or A, A, B.  However, no single pizza can be ordered multiple times.\n\nThe answer should include the number of combinations and also the number of different pizzas.\n\n\n### Explanations you might find useful\n\nPizza A = B + C, Pizza B = B + C, and Pizza C = B + C\n\n\nTo find the number of combinations, it helps to find the number of permutations. Because the number of permutations does not matter for this problem, only the number of combinations will suffice.  The order of toppings does not matter in this problem, as long as they are ordered together and there are no repeating topping combinations. The following is the formula to find combinations\n\ncombinations (A, B, C) = (combinations (A)) x (combinations (B)) x (combin-ations (C))\n\nTo find the combinations, we have to add up the number of unique orders.", "answer": "C: happiness"}

The total number is 92. We subtract 7 stickers from 89 sticker and get 82. So Mary used 82 stickers.

Now we know that he will get 70 dollars. After that, Zach work for 2 hours and gets 14 bucks. Then Zach earns 84 dollars. Then Zach needs 100+65=165. Zach needs 6 dollars more to earn before he buy a bike.\n\nFor Question Mark, I think Mark got X number of kangaroos, and X times 3 times more goats. Then I multiply 23 goats by X times 3.Then Mark has 3 times X goats, and 23 kangaros. Then I add 23 kangars + 3X * 2 = 23+6X = 23 + X = X + 23(X+3 =X). Then there are only 23(X-1) goats. Then we write it as X-123 goats. Then I add 3*23 = 69 goats. After that, I add X+2", "answer": "B: fragile"}

{"idx": 317, "text": "A\n\n<br>\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. Read and understand the questions. Write down all the variables and any helpful equations.\n2. In order to find the answer, you must first translate the word problem into a mathematical equation.\n\n### Solution:\n\nTo answer the first question, we should make a few assumptions with some simple math to set things up: Mary has 89 stickers\n\nWe are told that 3 large stickers were used on the cover, 7 were used individually on other pages and the\n  rest are all small stickers.\n  Using the above setup, we can derive three total equations:\n  L\n   + 7(S\n   + S\n\n3)                      == 89 \n   3\n   - 5 \n\n4)                               \n   2\n   - 5\n\n5)                       \n\n1) is just saying that 12 stickers were used in total. You can easily see from the numbers that this is a 1:3 ratio between the amount of larger and smaller stickers used.\n\n2) is saying that Mary used 3X amount of larger stickers per individual amount of smaller stickers used. Since she had 89 stickrs, this means she used 89/26 larger stickers. Since we know the ratio, we can see that larger sticker usage is a 3:1 ratio.\n\n3) is going from amount of small stickers to amount of larger stickers. Since 12 was the total amount of stickers used, you can see that 5, or half, of this was made up of smaller stickers. The larger stickers used was 3 times that of the smaller stickers, so half of 3 times 5 is also 3.\n\n4) just follows from 2) and 3) since if you had 6 pages (7*6), then you can see that she is using 1 small sticker per 6 pages. If she is using 1/6th of the total amount of stickes to put on other pages, then it follows that she is using 6 times as many small stickers than the overall amount of stickers. Also, remember that it's 1X the number of larger stickers used per individual smaller stickers used. You can see that if you divide", "answer": "C: illness"}

Choices: New York, NewYork\n  London\n  Paris\nOutput: Paris\n##### Solution:\nThe first method that popped in my mind was to simply use the modulus operator %. Given that the input is all in integers we can use `floor()` after to remove the decimal portion. Now we can calculate the percentage of each input:\n```\nval res = new ResonseParser(Array(true, true, true, false))\nval input = InputParser(res.getInputs)\nval inputPiece : Array[String] =  input.getInput(input.length-1.toString)\ninputPiece.map(a => {\n    val r = (a.length*10).toInt\n    val k = a.charAt(0).toString\n    val v = k.toInt*Int.MaxValue\n    val rt = r % v\n    rt % v\n  })\n```\nThe only method I could find that takes an integer and gives the remainder once divided by another integer is `remainder(b: BigInt, c: BigInt)`.  You don't always have floats around so it was necessary, but it does get the job done.\nMy next attempt was to get all the input in an array from the `InputParser` in a single line, then pass it to the `getRemainder` function. It will use `split` function to split the String based on the character `\\,` and return the answer in an array that will contain the string '0' if there is no remainer. Finally the `getRemainner` function will simply calculate each element in that array and add `BigInt` into the next `inputPiece` array:\n```\ndef getRemainder(input: Seq[String]) = {\n    input.map(a => (a.split(\"\\,\")):_*)\n    a.filter(_!= 0)\n  }\n```\n\nI know there's a better way to get the input in a sequence in a single", "answer": "C: table"}

Also I did a problem solving session, where we were given a problem (in which we need to find out how many chickens are there in the farm if we have 4 chicken thieves) and we would write a code to solve it and then, they will try to modify the code and find out how the code will work.\n\nMy interviewer was really generous as he gave me more time to work out one problem which was difficult for me.

All that we're doing in Code 401 is making sure your Javascript is better for real users. How you answer the questions in this course are how you make your website look good for the users. Before we can get started, we have to go over a couple of new things: loops, if else statements, and functions.\n\nFirst of all, we have to make our code better. How do we make our code better? With conditionals. \n\n### Conditionals\n\nBefore we can get started with coding, let\u2019s talk about what conditionals are.\n\nIn English, whenever we talk about conditions or anything related to a condition, it's always a statement that relates to yes or no, right and wrong, etc. \n\nFor example, conditionals can be statements such as whether this code works correctly or not, or if this code breaks or not. It can also be a simple as whether a user clicks on a part of the website or not.\n\nWe can use conditionals in JavaScript to check what is happening in that particular section of the website or what the user is doing with the website.  There are three conditions we can use.\n\nIf-else-if\n\nLet's say we want to add more questions to our quiz on Codecademy.  We do this by adding another option. In our case, it's just adding another if-else clause. \n\nHere is an example of the code we added:\n\nvar questions = ['Mary had 89 stickes.  She used 2 large stickers on the Front page of her journal and one large sticker  to a total of 7 stickers to 4 other pages of her journal.'];\n$('#content-box-question').html(questions[0]);\n\nfunction newQuestion() {\n    var choices = ['A: city', 'B: downtown', 'D: bar', 'E: shopping center'];", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

We will be using dictionaries to store and access these \n> items in the data storage called \"memory\". For a good list of memory types(RAM,ROM, and ROM etc.) check [this website](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_organization/memory_devices.htm).\n\n**Q1:**\n> Using a data structure to create a new question that tests the skill-set used to accomplish the above solution.\n\n**Q2-6**\n> This question tests your ability to store data in an effective way to access it easily.\n    - Q2: We need to get the money from three sources and then add that amount to a total variable\n    - Q3: This is an easier \"twist\" to add on to q2 in order to use a dictionary. We need to store key-value pairs based on the days of the week. This adds another requirement to check and add 2 more if statements \n    - Q4-6: Here we are using dictionaries to store key-value data pairs in a format that uses a string and value as the key and a string as the value. Here the questions asks to make the solution work for multiple pages of data.\n        In order to do so, we need to store the data from each page and then access our data-type in order to access the appropriate pages. This may sound confusing but, in the real-world where you have an extremely large amount of data and need to access it with a minimal amount of code and time, using a dictionary makes a lot of the problems much easier to solve.\n        \nIf you are following along with the course, this is a good example of the \"Why\" to using a particular data-structure over another. In order to answer this set of questions correctly, you would also have to understand why we are using a dictionary.\n\nIn an interview, understanding the \"Why\"", "answer": "D: female"}

If the remaining number of stickers is greater than 44, consider only combination of page and sticker which has a counter larger than 44\n\n###### Solution\n\nTo solve for this problem, we'll first generate the possible combination of each page count and sticker count in each page (the counter).

{"idx": 835, "text": "D\n\nA judge passes sentence on an offender convicted of a crime. This sentence is usually a prison term. But it can also be a fine, probation, community service or a combination of prison time and these other sanctions known as sentencing alternatives.\n  \nWhenever anyone is charged with an offence and pleads guilty or is convicted of an offence, the prosecutor will typically ask for some sanction. It's the judge's job to determine the sentence using a set of tools called the \"principles of sentencing.\" For some offenders, the judge will order a sentence \"in accordance with the law,\" which means it is the same as a previous offence of a similar nature. In some cases, the judge has to take the judge's guidelines (called \"normative sentencing\") into consideration. The guidelines also tell the judge when it is appropriate to give lesser or more severe sanctions.\n\nWhenever possible, the judge will also use the \"philosophy of sentencing\" as a guide. This means the judge will try to ensure the sentence fits both the offender's and the offence in mind. The judge is guided by a number of factors, including the offender's age, the level of remorse, personal circumstances, criminal record, as well as the consequences of the crime on victims.\n\n**More information:** http://www.judicial.gc.ca/eng/judges-and-the-system/the-canadian-justice-system/what-judges-do/whattjudg/?search_text=Sentencing", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}

Which part of the computer is responsible for the following tasks and how they work?\n   * Process: This is the command line from which all other applications are run, for example, Notepad, etc.\n   * **Memory:** This section serves as the temporary location of the operating system.\n   * **Storage devices:** This contains all the computer's permanent files.\n   * **CPU:** The heart of the computer, in which all the work is done, including the processing and storage of data.\n2. **What was the significance of the invention of binary (base two) numbers, and how exactly did they come to be established?**\n   * The importance of binary was established by George Boole, who invented them as a method of creating a simpler, numerical notation to replace the mathematical notation utilized in operations.\n   \n   For example, binary is used to calculate the results of the multiplication process 18, 527, 773 because the result is the equivalent in decimal notation of 959844909298811943704.\n\n3.  **What is a bit and what do bits represent?**\n   * \"Information\" is provided by bits. A bit is the smallest information unit that can be stored on a computer, also known as a binary digit.\n   \n  A bit either has a value of 0 or 1, which in computer terms equates to a value with either no power or a power of two, respectively. \n\n4.  What does it mean to convert a decimal number into binary notation (how is that done)?\n   * In order to execute this conversion, you would first place the decimal number in its appropriate location in the binary notation table.  \n   For instance, the decimal number 17 would be entered into the binary table as 10 0002 (base 2).\n5.  **What is the significance of positive and negative bases when discussing the conversion of a base?**\n   * A negative binary number indicates a negative quantity with a magnitude ranging from 1 to minus 1; examples include 1, 2, 0, and 10.\n   \n6.  **", "answer": "A: holding"}

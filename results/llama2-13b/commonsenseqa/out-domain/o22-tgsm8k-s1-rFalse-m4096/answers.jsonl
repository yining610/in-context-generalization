Sometimes the actual explanation is simpler than what you're asking, which is where your \"Why\" comes in. For example, do you know what a \"function\" is?

It's just a name for what a user types in when a program is running.\n\nThat said, you could get input:\n\n\\begin{pre}\n$x = 5;\n$y = $x + 1;\n$x -- 1;\n\\end{pre}\n\nI got $x = 3 and $y = 4 for this. I hope that's what you meant, but it would be hard to tell without a more complete question, because \"it's not working\" is just not very helpful detail.\n\nComment: Thanks for answer but I need a loop that is input = input*2, and I need that for every variable that I have.

You'll probably get about a week's notice that you have one scheduled, give or take.\n\nFor most questions, the questions are in no particular order of difficulty and there's no trick to some random ones being harder.\n\nI suggest you get used to just seeing code on a computer screen in this format to start, and then move to white boards and paper as you get used to that, and then move on from there to real development tasks.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Google FooBar style questions, here are 3 practice questions for you to attempt:\n\n\\begin{code}\n1) Implement the code for a quicksort function, in C and JavaScript with comments and tests.\n2) Implement a reverse function in C and JavaScript with tests.\n3) How would you implement memmove to handle memory overflows and errors gracefully?\n\\end{code]\n\nIf you can answer the above 3 properly (to a decently decent level, e.g. good but not perfect), you've passed the first 2 stages of FooBar. Hope this helps!\n\nComment: For more info on C programming for Google FooBar and interview questions, check out: http://www.foobars.org/\n\nAnswer: It's a Google interview, and for the people that have never been to one, you can expect any of google's interview questions to come your way.  But, it's possible some of the more complex ones, as listed by the OP, may be in their \"technical round\".

Choices: 2 3 4 5\nOutput: 2 \n\n### Instruction\uff1aAnswer the following question.\nThere are two numbers: n1 and n2. We want to find two numbers y1 and y2 such that y1 + y2 = n1, y1 \u00d7 y2 = n2. Both y1 and y2 need to be small.\nFor example:\nThere are two numbers, 12 and 3624.\n1. We can find y1 and y2 = 1. y1 \u00d7 y2  =  12 but this isn't good because y1 isn't small.\n    In order to change it into y2 = 3624/12 = 3 and y1 = 1. y2 \u00d7 y1  = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 is much better.\n2. We can also find y1 and y3 = 31 and y1 \u00d7 y3  =  3624 but this isn't better than 3 \u00d7 1. The former is bigger.\n3. We can also find both numbers, y1 = 3626 and y3 = 27, and y1 \u00d7 y2  3624, y3 \u00d7 y1 = 27 \u00d7 3626. This has the smallest possible y1 and y2.\n\n### Input:\nn1 = 700, n2 = 7000\n\n### Output:\nA list of four elements. y1 and y4 are small integers (less than 10). y2 and y3 are very small integers such that y1 * y2 + y3 * y4 = n1 * n2\n    \n### Input:  \nn1 = 50, n2 = -100\n\n## Input:\nn1, n2 = [-1, -5]\n\n## Output:\nA list where n1, n2, n3, n4 = [2, 25, 0, -5] are all", "answer": "A: mouth"}

{"idx": 493, "text": "D\n\n\n### Additional question: 6th addition, please answer question 1 to 5\n\n- 1 point for correct answer\n\n### 1. In a class of students, 1/4 of the student like football, while the remaining students don\u2019t like watching football. Among those who like football, 3/5 of them want to watch a football game on TV on the weekend, while only 1/4 of those who don\u2019t like football want to watch a football match on TV. If 19 students like watching a football match on TV, then how many of them prefer watching football?\n\n### 2. A shelf can hold 27 textbooks with a total weight of 17.6 lbs, and it is full if we place a total of 38 pounds of books with an average weight of 6.3 lbs on the shelf. If a few textbooks from the shelf are taken out and placed on the floor at the same time, which weighs 3.2 lbs, find the number of textbooks we must place on the shelf to restore the shelf.\n\n### 3. A class of students is having a 50/50 raffle. If 75 students buy 190 tickets for the first draw, and the same number of students buy 244 tickets for the second draw with half the amount of money with the first draw, how many tickets does each student buy on average for the second draw?\n\n### Answer: 2.04.\n\n### For the first draw, the total of ticket bought in the class is 190/75*50 = 31.67.\n\nFor the second draw, the total of tickets bought in the class is (190/72)*244 = 6.128572.\nThe number of tickets an average student gets in the class is thus \\((31.67 + 6.12)/2 = 22\\).\n\n### 4.

For example \n\n* 0% -> 0, \n* 1% -> 1\n\nThe question asks for 0 - 1, so you have to subtract 1 from the first value to get a value of 0 to 1. This gets you started on the question. \n\nLet's try some other values.\n\n* 5% -> If you divide 5 by 100 you get 1%.

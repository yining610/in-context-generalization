Write a program that finds all the places where a pair of a given kind of jewelry is being worn at the same time.<n><n>### The following points of note:<n>- In order to implement this problem in a fast yet efficient way, think about implementing it in a data-structure way<n>- If you aren't familiar with image processing, think that a pixel is simply represented as an array with the value of RGB. With each pixel, I can then construct a data-structure which may be considered as a key/value pair where key is the current and previous RGB values and value is a number which represents jewelry ID. Thus, with each pair of jewelry, we must update the key and value accordingly.<n><n>## PseudoCode:<n>- Given an image, we can then represent each pixel as key/value pair where the key is current RGB and the value is the jewelry ID such as (RGB-jewelry identifier)<n>- Initialize the frequency map as a set<n>- Set the frequency at a specific coordinate to 0<n>- For each pixel, get the adjacent pixels' RGB values<n>- If the frequency is found in the frequency map at the adjacent coordinate, we can remove the previous coordinate to reduce duplicate count<n>- Else, add the frequency map with the new coordinate's frequency count<n>- When a duplicate frequency is found, we can then update the frequency map value at the coordinate with the new jewelry pairs<n><n>## Visualization:<n><img src="https://github.com/xiaowenzhen74/Hacktoberfest2019/blob/master/img/question5-1.png" width="640" height="562"/><br><n><img src="./img/question5-2.png" width="763" height="453"/><br><n><n>## Solution:<n>```<n>// Given a black and white image (

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: 6<n><n>Input:Where would a Martian find the Indian Ocean? Choices:  A: asia B: southern hemisphere C: planet D: east E: earth<n>Output:		 C<n><n>Input:If the radius of a circle was tripled, what would its area become? Choices:<n><n>A: 11 pi<n>B: 12 pi<n>C: 22 pi<n>D: 9 pi<n>Input2:You are given a rectangular garden that is 30 yards wide and 15 yards long. If you add 5 yards to each of its sides, what would the area of the garden become?<n><n>A: 48 squares<n>B: 45 squares<n>C: 20 squares<n>D: 10 squares<n><n>Input3:If you have an egg carton, and the carton is 4 inches in diameter at its base and it is 3 inches in height. How much water could an egg carton hold if the bottom had a ¼ inch thick layer of water?<n>A: 5 ounces<n>B: 50 ounces<n>C: 500 ounces<n>D: 5,000 ouncesE: none of the choices<n><n><n>##1. Given the following example, we can see that the input "Mary had 89 stickas" is given to the function "sum". Now we must return the sum of those stickers as a multiple of the amount stored in the variable num<n>- The input is an integer, so we will use python's `int()` function to convert it to an integer. <n>- Then the next step is to define the function that returns the sum. To do this, we will define the `sum()` function, which takes two arguments: the input and the output.<n>input: int num: 89<n>input: string sumOfNums: Mary had 849 stickas <n>return sumOfNums: 44<n>sum(int num, string sumOfNums)"<n>sum() => num 89<n>sum() => sumOfNums "Mary had 349 stickas 899"<n>return int(99)<n><n>##2. This problem is similar to the previous problem. But in this case we will not be using the input as a string. Instead, we will use the input as an integer with the following function<n>- We use the function `num-input` to convert the input to an integer, and we use the function `num=sum

For example, for question 1 above and an input of 89, you will likely see an answer of 44 after it has been processed through the learning algorithm.<n><n>#### Example: Train station<n><n>### This example shows a possible interaction between the user and the machine learning model by asking questions about "train station<n><n>`Can the user train a new question in the machine learning model that it has never previously learned about? `<n>A. Yes <n><n>B. No <n><n>C. None of the above <n><n>D. Do not know <n><n>`In a normal case, there is no need to train a new question in machine learning because machine learning algorithms are designed to learn by themselves from examples that humans provide. Therefore, machine learning can learn about any input data or patterns and automatically discover the most optimal solutions without being explicitly programmed by people. It also means that you can build advanced applications which can automatically adapt to different kinds of scenarios without any manual interventions from humans.<n><n>In a normal case, the user can train a new answer in the machine learning model by providing new examples (answers) for previously unseen questions. For example, the user may come up with the following question during a conversation: <n>"What should I do if someone steals my wallet?" <n>The machine learning model will recognize this question and provide the following two answers: "Call 911" and "Let go of your wallet". However, neither of these two answers can be considered as correct because they do not address the issue in detail. <n><n>Consequently, the user will provide a new answer to the machine learning model: "Call 999". Consequently, the machine learning model will learn that calling 99

In this example, your task is to compute the largest number x for which 2**x <= y.<n><n>`int largestNumber(int y); //your code goes here, you may modify and redefine int y here`<n><n>### Questions 2: Complete the following code. <n><n><n>Write a function to compute the number of binary search tree levels for an unknown argument, lvl_cnt, for the following BST type.<n><n>```c<n>struct node<n>{<n>    int data;<n>    struct node* left;<n>    struct node *right;<n>};<n>```<n><n>### Hint:<n><n>To answer this question, you are provided with one function, binarySearchTreeLevel, which will take in the struct node, and return the level of the particular node. In order to solve this question, you need to write a new function, which will receive the level as an int, and return the number of levels with that particular level. You are allowed to modify this function; the default implementation has all levels of nodes as 1; you do not have to start counting from 0.<n><n>You might also wish to use the helper function `lvl_cnt_r`, which will return the highest level as a `int`. The helper function is defined as:<n><n>```c<n>int lvl_cnt_r(int level);<n>```<n><n>Sample Usage for lvl_cnt_l:<n><n>```c#<n>lvl_cnt_l((struct node* a)->right);<n>// Returns the # of levels which start after the root node<n>```<n><n>```c# lvl_cnt_s(int level);<n>// Returns the highest level - 1 (counting from 0)<n>```<n>

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n>Output:		B<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>#### The logic behind this problem is not obvious. I believe the answer might be hidden somewhere in the words, but I couldn't figure it out after spending quite some time with this problem. I was not able to solve this question till the interviewer gave me a clue, but since the question was already on my GitHub, I won't edit it though. Here is the clue: <n>For the 2nd problem, I have a small hint for you. <n><n>Movement (direction) always gives you a vector. <n><n>So that is good for you. <n>Now also remember that a vector is not necessarily always about moving forward. <n>For instance - if you are driving straight ahead, that's like a +1 x and -1y vector<n><n>That's just one example - vectors can actually be from any direction. <n><n>Anyway, I will not get into too much details. <n>Use vectors to do the calculations - should be quite straightforward then<n>-J<n><n>So I figured that for the 2nd problem the answer should be 4$ as the question explicitly stated the neighbor would pay him 7$ per hour and since its Saturday it would be 2 hours. I didn't think beyond that so I tried this on the coding test and I failed. Then I figured out after this that the value should be 3$ because I ignored the fact that in the problem it was stated that he has already collected 65$ from his allowance. Therefore, the total he got from his neighbor for babysitting will cover half of the price he has to pay for buying the bike.<n>

As you've already installed the Ruby interpreter, you can immediately run a Ruby program:<n><n>```ruby<n>> a_simple_program = <<-EOF.strip_heredoc<n>>  print "Hello, World!"<n>>  print "\n"<n>>  EOF<n>>  a_simple_program<n>=> "print \"Hello, World!\"\n\n"<n>><n><n>> print a_simple_program.strip<n>=> Hello, World!<n><n>> print "!"<n>=><n><n>> print "Hello, World! "<n>=> Hello, World!<n>```<n><n>#### This is how you use puts command, which is equivalent to print "string" in Python.<n>Put your first output code in between the following code:<n>puts "Hello, World!"puts "!"puts "Hello, world!"<n><n>You can put more than one string, as in puts "Hello", "World!" <n><n>The difference between puts "Hello, world!" and puts "Hello", "world!" is that in the latter, puts prints "Hello" in one line, then "World!" in another line. In the former, puts prints "Hello, World!" in one line. The reason why puts does not print "Hello\nWorld!" in one line is because this is not allowed in Ruby syntax. What we can do is to explicitly give an extra space (\) for two string to be printed in one line: <n>puts "Hello\, World!"<n>

Using a For Loop to Calculate the Remaining Stickers<n><n>A for loop is an ideal programming technique that we will use to get a fast iteration method to process a large list of elements. <n><n>We can use a for loop to iterate through a list and perform a calculation on each item. For example, we can use a for loop for the following situations:<n><n>* Iterate through a Python list to print all the elements inside.<n>* Iterate through the first number in a tuple.<n>* Iterate over a dictionary.<n>* Iterate though a sorted list.<n><n>Let's look at an example of for loops. In that example, I am using a list of elements to create an infinite loop. If you've read along enough in this tutorial, you'll easily notice that an infinite loop simply never stops on its own. If you want to end the loop early, there are two ways to do that; either put a break inside the body of the loop, or just press ctrl-c. <n><n>Let's add a break after the number 10, and then execute the example.<n><n>### Instruction:Type your code at runtime mode, and submit.<n><n>    a = [i for i in range(43)]<n>    b = [i * 2 for i in range(13)]<n>    c = [i**2 * 3 for i in range(23)]<n><n>    print(a)<n>    print(b)<n>    print(c)<n>    Break for the first 'i' when it equals 10<n><n>Output:<n><n>* [42, 43]<n>* [0, 26, 52, 0, 58, 116, 0, 174, 348, 0, 72, 147, 284, 0, 428]<n>* [0]<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following question.<n><n>An object has dimensions 24, 4, and 7.5.

What is a method?<n>- A method performs an action for a class. Methods can be implemented inside a class with a body or outside of methods with a reference. Internal methods can only be called from an instance of the class. External methods can be called from anywhere. Methods are important because they allow us to write and reuse code.<n><n>2. What is the difference between a static and an instance variable.<n><n>- Variables that are defined as part of a class are called class variables. They only exist within the context of the class they are defined in. Variables that are defined in the context of a class instance are called instance variables. They exist only within the context of the instance that they are defined in. Instance variables are commonly referred to as instance variables because each instance has its own copy of the variables. Static variables are class variables that are assigned a value when the class object is instantiated.<n><n>3. What is the use of instance variables in ruby?<n>- Instance variables are used as member variables for an object. Each instance of a class has its own copy of those instance variables.<n><n>4.

For example, input 4 divided by 2 is equal to 2.  The Math class handles these calculations as if 4 divided by 3 is equal to 1.25.<n><n>*   The code that computes the answers has nested for-loop structure that allows the code to keep track of whether a condition is true and false.  This allows the logic behind each answer to be expressed in an easy to understand and concise manner.<n><n>---<n><n>##### Contributors:<n><n>| [name](https://github.com/aish-dev-team-1/Aish-Code-Challenge/commits?author=Yoona8611)|[linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyunyoon-kim-5a7644165/)|[github](https://github.cm/Yoona86/)|<n>|:--------------------------------

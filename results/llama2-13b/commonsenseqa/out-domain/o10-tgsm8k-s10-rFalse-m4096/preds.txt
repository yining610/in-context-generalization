Two players each place and hide a fleet of ships on a board. Players place their ships at different locations on the board and mark them as'shots' (hit or miss). The position of the player's ships are kept secret, but each player receives a grid of 10x10 with squares representing ships. The grid displays ship locations with the fleet hidden behind the grid.  As the game progresses, the players take turns firing a shot and a shot is shown with a 'hit' or a'miss'. The objective is to find the position of all of the players ships by firing at them. The first player who marks a ship wins the game. Note that this is a single-player game, not battleship multiplayer.<n><n>### Hint: Use a dynamic array, a 2D array and set it up so that you can look at every item in the array one by one, use a for loop!<n><n>### Note:<n>In the algorithm, you need to:<n>	- First generate a set number of coordinates  for ships<n>	- Then randomly place them throughout the board to represent the player's fleet.<n>	- Once done, let a player know what their ships are, so that they can keep track of what they have left and what they should be looking for. For example, if they have 2 ships, they will need 2 coordinates as the coordinates of their ships.<n>

The population of 630,000,000 was achieved after 397 years. How long ago did the current species ancestors start with a population of 1?<n>Output: 1.85165<n><n>Explanation (Part 1 of 2): 1 + p = P0 + P0(1 + 397p)/(100-397) where P0 is the original seed of population 1. Given p = 0.0083 per year, <n>Solving for 397p in this last equation gives us 397p = 0.3298. Dividing both sides by 7 gives us  397/7 = 0.0302 years per generation. If this species had the same population growth today as then, they would have a population of 88,888,000, which is 13,699,000 off the given population of 700 million, so the seed generation must have had a population of 1/137,000, or 1. Now we must find the seed (year 0) using this formula and the fact that the 397 pop was reached 397 years ago. We must find the number of years ago in which the 1.85 pop was reached. This number is 8.

There are two approaches (there is always an easier way):<n>* find the prices: Adam bought 3kg of nuts and 3kg of dried fruits. One kilogram of one is $12, so the other is also $12. The first is $3*12 = $36, the second is $3*10 is $30. For a total of $66.<n>* find the prices first, then find out the total amount: One kilogram of nutes is 2.5kg of dried fruites for $12, so we know that one kg is 2.5/12. For the three kilograms of nutes, it is 3*2.5/144, and 3*2.4 for dried fruites. Therefore, Adam bought his purchases for $144*3/2.4 and $72*3/2.5 for a total of $56.<n><n>In the second question, one option is to multiply 3*3*4*4, which is equivalent to 160. In the third question, he buys 1 ton of gas at the first price and another 0.5 ton of gas at the second price. 1.11 * 200 will get the 220.<n><n>The fourth question is pretty typical in programming contest competitions. Using division of probability to find the average to get the amount needed.<n><n>The fifth question is asking for the average in a period of time, so using a weighted average to get the amount each player would get.<n><n>In the

I was wondering if a little bird told me a secret I would never forget about my love life.  In the midst of a heavy breeze that was coming from the East, I heard the sound of a key rattling on our lock box like a train passing through the tunnel.  I rushed to the door knowing who it was going to be.  To my surprise, I saw a guy standing at the doorstep with a basket full of groceries and a bouquet of freshly cut flowers.  He told me he came to get me and I replied ‘how could you come to get me at this time of the day?’  As I approached my apartment and turned on the lights I could see the food cart he pulled on the entryway.  In every dish I could taste the true passion of a skilled chef.  I felt my nose twitching and realized I was hungry.  The bouquet was lovely with all kinds of blooming lilies, rose bushes, lilacs, and more.  As the sun slowly set like a tired old man on his feet, the birds started to disappear from the air and went to sleep in their nests.  As I prepared the table I could only think about my love life. I heard footsteps in the living room towards me and saw her dressed in a long black silky dress with 10,000 little silver paillettes. From behind she looked shiny even in the dark and her smile blinds me.  Her feet were as soft as her hairy fur coat, as she came closer I could feel her presence grow in the room.  She hugged me and kissed me on the lips, smelling like a perfume of roses.  The only word I could say was ‘hungry’, as we started to eat, I looked into her eyes and understood this was going to be the best night of my life.<n>Output: A long and poetic tale of passion between a couple and their love that goes beyond words. <n></input><n><n><input type="text"><n><n><n>###Instruction: Complete your homework by filling in the blanks on the

Multiple choice questions typically ask the student to select the correct answer from a list of possible responses, which makes them ideal for testing basic knowledge and understanding.<n><n>The format of our input, in which the correct answer is shown at the beginning of the test, is designed to allow students to compare their answers to the correct answer before submitting their test. This helps students to know if they have misrepresented the question or missed the question or are confused on what the question represents. As we noted, we will work hard to make the user-interface and input work and allow our tests to continue to work until we develop a strong interface that works for everyone. We will make sure the program is very user-friendly and will work well for everyone who uses the program.<n><n>The instructions will be very basic for these tests and will be a short list of rules and questions with a short description. For this project, I've decided to change a major part of how the tests will operate. The purpose for this is to provide some questions that may be somewhat complex or confusing. This will force students to use critical thinking to answer the questions. For all questions, our instructions must meet the following standards:<n><n>Our code must work as per all expectations below:<n><n>    Our project will always need to work in a browser<n><n>    It must load quickly<n><n>    It must never be down<n><n>    The output text we display must be formatted and spaced well<n><n>Our text must always follow proper English format so it is not confusing or unreadable<n><n>Our text will be displayed in a proper font and will never overlap with other data<n><n>Our tests must always be understandable<n><n>All of our instructions must follow a standard for our users so that they understand how the project will work. Our instructions must include a basic description of the expected input, which may include a formula or a pattern of some sort.

In this particular question there are four choices and only three of them are correct answers. Two of them are actually the same thing which is the problem.<n>```<n>#### What have you tried?<n>```<n>I have used an if-elif-else system to check if the correct answer matches that question. Then depending on that I put my output for that statement using a list.<n>```<n>#### Why did that not work?<n>```<n>In my program, I was checking to see if the answer to the question selected matched the answer to the question in the list. Then depending on that answer I gave the correct answer. The problem with this approach was that two of the answers were the same thing. For example, the answer for number 3 is answer 5. If there are now two choices with the same name then the program will get confused on which one is correct.<n>```<n>#### How could we fix this?<n>```<n>Fixing this problem would mean going back to the original idea and checking for if the answer to the problem matches the number in the list. Then I would display which answer that is for that number.<n>```<n>##### Why do you think that will work better?<n><n>```<n>That's the best way to display the answer.<n>```<n><n>#### What else should be done?<n>```<n>I should really work more on my program and make sure that the other parts work.<n>```<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following short answer questions.<n><n>####1.

It's not specific and you're just asking us to do the work for you to get a job. The employer just wants proof that you can follow instructions to see how you'd handle it. If you run into a bug or don't understand the question, make a question about it.<n><n>Comment: In Python, you don't need to define a class for it just yet. You just need to define a few methods, so you may want to leave that part out.<n><n>Answer: I don't know what you are trying to accomplish, exactly. But you have a problem because your code has only a single object, created through `MyObj.m_obj = object()`.<n><n>So what happens if you call something like `MyObj.method()`? It will call `method()` on that \em{one and only} object.<n><n>What you want is a \em{method} (a \em{function}) which \em{creates} the object. Something like this:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>def obj(self):<n>  # do stuff<n>\end{code }<n><n>Then you \em{call} that method, either explicitly<n><n>\begin{blockquote}<n><n>create_a_test_object.obj()<n>\end{blockquote}<n><n>... or implicitly (but only once you create another method which then calls it, of course.)<n><n>This all assumes that you are using a class, not that you are trying to monkeypatch a singleton or other instance of your object.  It's not that I doubt that it is what you want to do, it's just that the code you have shown us does not include the creation of an instance of your object.<n><n>With that caveat, I found this statement:<n><n>\begin {code}<n>if self.result == False:<n>\end{code}, ... somewhat mystifying.<n><n>What if there is an error, and `self.result` would be the cause?  If it is some kind of setter, which has set it to `False`, then it should probably throw an error, and not return from the method call,  with `True`.<n><n>\begin{pre}<n>`print("something went wrong.")`<n>\end{pre}<n><n>

The helper function is to sort the numbers. The numbers is a list, you can simply call list function sorted() to sort them out. With that and we can start creating helper function to create anagram.<n><n>1. First we should count each letter and sort those lists into a tuple. In this case we have a list of "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", we need to split them into pairs and sort them out.<n>   ``` python<n>   for i in word:<n>    if letter_count[i] == 1:<n>        tuple_pair += [i]<n>    else:<n>        tuple_count += (letter_pair+[i])<n>   ```<n>2. Now we should map the tuple to a dictionary. Here we use the value to check if the same letter exist. With that we can create the anagram. We should be careful not to append the same value for the string or list, otherwise it won't work.<n>   ``` python <n>   output = {}<n>   for i in tuple_pair:<n>    if tuple_count[0] == i:<n>        output.update({i:tuple_count[1]})<n>    else:<n>       tuple_count[1],tuple_count[0] = tuple_count[0],tuple_count[1],output.update({i:0})<n>   ```<n>3. After we create the dictionary, we can check with each dict we have.<n>   ``` python    <n>    word = input()<n>    if word in output: #check if the word exist in the dictionary<n>        print(output[word]) #prints the dictionary value<n><n>    else:<n>            print("It's not an anagram")<n>    ```<n>And that's it for today, see you next time for your next lesson.

For example, I dont know Java, but if I know that Java was created by James Gosling for Sun Microsystems and first appeared in 1995, or that James Gosling also created NeWS, one of the earliest windowing systems for personal computers, then I would know that the answer to question 10 about the man who invented Java would be James Gosling.<n><n>Answer: One simple way you could do it would be to try some of the different questions with your friends and ask them what they thought of your answers and improve from there.<n><n>Answer: The best strategy to get all the correct answers would be to try all the answers out and choose the correct one.<n><n>Answer: Well, you could solve it by a program that solves it, but to give you better advice, I'd say keep studying and taking the class rather than skipping ahead and hoping to cheat your way out of it. The instructor won't like that.<n><n>Comment: I'm afraid that is the only answer he needs for the class assignment, he doesn't have to write anything.<n><n>Comment: @Layth That's sad, because it's way too basic of a programming assignment.

In the mansion there was a large amount of rubble which had been collected over the past 200 years. The rubble was also used for storage of old documents and other items by the local people as they had no idea where to store them. When we entered the mansion, we found that there were some huge chests on the floor of the basements and that all three of the chests contained an enormous number of documents and other items. My friend told me that he was going to sell all these chests to some museums across Ireland and that he would ask his friend to take them back to the place where he was going to dispose of the chests. We were very happy with him and he told us that if there were any problems with the removal of the chests then he would come back to Ballyhaunis and help us in any way he could.

For example, instead of creating a string \"a\" and then creating another string \"x\" and adding them together to make \"ax\", why not just create a string \"ax\" and concatenate it with itself?  Or, instead of creating a number 2, and putting a star in front of it, why not create the string \"2005\" and concatenate the string with itself?  You will not need help with that problem, but it's an example of how to think about the problem in an easier way.\n2. The questions all have something in common, and it's important to figure out the similarity and general formula.  It will help you understand the question better and write an easier function.\n3. Once you've written the correct code, you know it's correct because the tests will pass.  Sometimes, you may think something is correct when it's not, but if you let your brain rest for a bit and look at the problem from afar, you'll more than likely figure out the error that you made.  You should have a \"wow\" feeling when you write correct code for these questions.", "answer": "E: mississippi"}

Below is a sample of what your program will need to do.\n# The numbers you'll have to generate are randomly selected, so if your program does not generate the same numbers we produced, that's fine! The important thing is to show that you understand how your for-in statement makes the code work, and how it allows you to generate a random sequence of integers.\n# Challenge: The first two lines of the program we wrote to generate this sequence appear below. Can you write the code necessary to generate a sequence of 10 integers greater than 150 and less than 200?\n# First, take a guess at the first value in the sequence. Next, generate a number between 0 and 9. Remember that 0 doesn't work, since it is not between 1 and 9. Now, if the number you generated is 1, then you're done! This is because it's the first number in the sequence and all you have to do now is generate the next nine. If your number is not 1, take two guesses as to which numbers will come next in the sequence; we think that 172 and 151 will work!\nInput: First try to guess what the first number will be. Then, try to see which of the next nine numbers you can guess!\nOutput: 192\n\n# Challenge: We need you to write a for-in statement for this program, and then try your best to get it to generate a random sequence just like the one illustrated above! For practice, try it with the following sequence. You can do it on paper if you want, but it's important that you understand how the for-in statement works in Python!\n# Hint: It doesn't always have to start at 0! Just type out the steps you performed below to generate each number in the sequence. Remember that 0 is between 1 and 2, but you don't want to guess an integer between 0 and 1, and 2 and 3!

The road curved around hills, fields of crops, farms, a few copses of trees that I spotted from a distance, and a few towns. After I turned,  it would take me about an hour before i could turn back. I always take that same route because I've driven there so often. There was only one small road off the main road I was on. I could have turned onto that road, but I knew it would lead to another town to the west that I really had no intention to drive to.  And I knew if I had to turn and come all the way back, it would take another 20 minutes, and it was too far for just a short detour  or a short break for a few hours. I didn't want to go through several small towns and go to a town I had been to only once before, that's why I had the car. The first stop I made was to a service station. I really had to use the bathroom. So i drove over to the service station and went inside and walked around the racks and racks of cans of motor oil and candy and tobacco and drinks. Inside the door was a large coffee table-like structure that had the daily papers, many of them folded open at the front-page stories. There were a couple of chairs on either side of the table, too, and a TV against one wall, but it wasn't on.  I guess it was 5 P.M. by now, so it would be late for it to start showing the evening newscast. But there was nobody in the television store room and nobody in the convenience store room. I got out of there quickly. On my way back out the door, I noticed another room on the left that looked like some kind of storage room. Two large filing cabinets stood in front of it and I could smell the old papers inside them. I wanted to go into the restroom. I got back into the car.

To solve the case, we loop through the set and look for a \"repeated\" element. If a repeated element is found, we remove that pair from the set because we already have a solution that contains such a pair. If not found, we keep looping.)\n\nInput:\n-A: 2 4 8 16 24\n-D: 6 9 12 15 18\nOutput:4\n\n### Instruction:The following is an example for the 3rd question about the aircraft.\n\n1. PREPROCESSING (2pts):\n\n(Note: this is a sample problem. In real question, there will be no example.)\nThe first step is to import the required libraries from the Python standard library. Additionally, we preprocess the text in to a Python dictionary. A rule is to split the lines by tabs.  The first field: \u201cAirplanes\u201d \u201c5-15\u201d \u201c2014.09.26\u201d\nThis step is done by using a for loop to split the text (Airplanes\u201d lines above). Then we apply str.split() to turn a string into a list of individual characters.\n\n2. PATTERN MATCH (6pts):\n\nAs the question gives us a pattern, we can implement the pattern into a program.\n\n    pattern=[\u201cA\u201d:\u201dAircraft_id\u201d,\u201dB\u201d:\u201dtakeoff_date\u201d,\u201dC\u201d:\u201dlanding_date\u201d]\n\n    for example, aircraft_id is stored as the first column in the dictionary under \u201cA\u201d.\n\n    We know the \u201cX 3 Y\u201d pattern is just a rule that has no particular data. Thus, we do not need to store that inside the pattern.\n    We use the for loop to apply loop for each lines inside the text. In each line, we apply str.split():\n        The first field is stored in \u201cA\u201d column;\n        The next field is stored in the \u201cB\u201d column;\n        We end the loop after we are done with the third field.\n\n    We use the regex function to apply the pattern match", "answer": "D: somber"}

You know the basic idea here -- every time you code something, write the unit tests to validate that the code is working correctly. In earlier course modules, you have seen some unit tests. In this module, you will see more.\n\nAs you can see, writing unit tests is more than just a good idea or an alternative approach to testing. It **is** a real testing and validation effort -- for many development teams these are the only test efforts they do!\n\nThe concept of writing the unit tests first and then writing the code to make it pass is called TDD -- Test Driven Development. You saw this in action in the code you just submitted, didn't you?\n\nNow you have seen code with real unit tests -- not just sample unit tests. The code that was just submitted had unit tests as well as code and it had to satisfy the tests.\n\nNow we will talk about how to test and validate code in", "answer": "E: office supply store"}

Therefore, the cost is $12 + $1.5 which is $13.5.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the next question, which is different from all of the questions before.\n\n#### Question\n\nInput: Adam's phone is broken.  He calls an iphone repair shop called Repairiod and an android repair shop called Droid Repair to come fix his issue. The cost of repair is $50 at Repairiod and $30 at Droid Repair.  Both companies will charge the same base price but will then charge an additional $10 for every month this phone has not been updated.  How much will either repair shop charge?\n\n**Output:**30\n\n**Explanation:**The cost incurred at Repairiod is $(50+10\u00d7n)$ and the same for droid Repair. But for both the company n is not fixed.\nIt can be calculated as $(50+(10+(10\u00d7n)))=15+(10\u00d7n-n)=15+(1-n)$\n\n$n=(120-50/n-120+50)/1= -240000/40$\n\n$n=$60 \n\nAnswer: Repairiod charge Adam $40   Droid charge Adam $30", "answer": "A: hear crowd go mad"}

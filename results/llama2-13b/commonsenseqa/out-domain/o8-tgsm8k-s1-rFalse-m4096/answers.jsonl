{"idx": 92, "text": "vomiting\n\n# Instructions: Read the following passage and answer the questions.\nMost people are unaware of the significant impact of the computer on society and have not yet considered the implications of the future development of computers. Some day, however, computers will become more powerful than the human brain; with intelligence approaching, then surpassing our own. Computers will likely become the most powerful tools ever known. At first blush, the notion of computers surpassing the human brain may seem ludicrous. However, this is not the case. Computer power has grown at a rate of 100,000 times more in the past thirty years than the growth of the human brain in the past thirty thousand years.  Today's personal computers can process information and do complex calculations at a rate of more than a thousand million (one thousand million!) \"thoughts\" per second.\nComputer scientists and engineers now routinely predict that computers capable of carrying out the thoughts and actions of a human brain will be built in a few decades. They are also quite confident that by then it will be possible for computers to communicate with us in our own language.  The day computers outstrip human intelligence is bound to arrive; how soon will it come? No one knows. It's impossible, however, to deny the potential that computers have to impact our lives.

{"idx": 371, "text": "b\n\n\n### Discussion about your answer\nWhat the program is supposed to do is determine the total amount the person still has leftover of their money or object.\n\nThe way the program does this is by the program using the variables to hold the data. When it reaches the sum of all the variables (excluding the initial value of the variable) it sums those values up and gives us the answer. If its in the thousands it rounds to the hundred and it will continue that process until we have the right answer. If its in decimals it will get the right answer. Also, the program checks if the number is negative and will print \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have That in Your Wallet.\u201d\n\nI would say the code is pretty clean, because it is easy to understand and I don\u2019t see a lot of comments to explain what it is doing. Only in some parts I have commented about certain features, such as saying \u201cThis method is used to find the maximum amount\u2026\u201c This is only used in parts where I have implemented methods into the program. The code was easy to read and understand, because it is in a well put-together manner.\n\n\n### What did you learn from this exercise\nI learned about methods being used in a more complex way, instead of just using them to output stuff. I also learned how to compare different numbers together and how the program deals with the problem in hand. Also, I learned how the program keeps a check on the total value of the person\u2019s wallet to make sure that it is not negative.\n\nI learnt about methods, if clauses, switch case, double.\n\nI learnd that you can ask the computer some questions of what's going on in a program, then the program can analyze everything and then it can answer your questions.\n\nI learmed how to put a comment so that other people can understand what's going on and how long will the program will run.\n\n\n[](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/beginner-python-3/0/2/1?curriculum_id=5caa1fca0177f600041f0238&path_slug=problem-solving-with-python&code_redirect=true&code_repo=NvNX3XbT976kV5", "answer": "A: look at"}

A group of numbers in the range (0, 300] (that is, it is less than 300);\n2. A group of numbers of the form 10+ (X % 10) %, where X is in (0, 3*10^6] (that is, X is an integer between 0 and 3,000,000);\n3. A group of numbers that is not any of the first two groups.\n\nAs an aside to this problem: In order to solve this problem more efficiently, you might think of adding the number as a series of single-digit numbers. To add 27, for example, you might think \"27\" is equivalent to 10 and 7, so adding single digits you would have 1 + 7 = 8 and add it to 10, for a total of 18.\n\nExamples for the input in the above format:\n`10020`\n\nOutput Examples:The output should be printed in the following format\n\n```bash\n7920 8020 7821\n```\n\n```bash\n10 11 3937\n```\n\nThe answer must be an exact match.

What is the estimated life expectancy of a teenager in 1952?\n2. What is the estimated rate of life expectation that is lost when life expectancy for a country\u2019s population rises by one year?\n\nOutput:\n1. 68\n\n2. 0.1\n\n**Note:** The answers for these questions have been randomly generated for the purposes of the test and do not reflect real numbers or population health.\n\n##### Hint\n\nIf the life expectancy in 2010 is 80 years, then you can use this equation to calculate the life expectancy in the 50's:\n\nlife_expectancy_in_50_s = 65 + (80 - 65)/10 * 50 = 72.5\n\n\n##### Hints & Tips\n\n1. You can get a rough estimate of average life expectancy using this equation.\n  \n   ```python\n    life_expectancy = 65 + 0.4*(current life expectancy - 65)\n   ```\n\n\n2. To compute the lost life expectancy per increased year of life expectancy, you can divide the difference in life expectancy by the number of years of increase.\n\n\n### Solution Instructions:\n\n \n\n#### Example:\n\n```python\n'''\nThe average life expectancy in the US has been increasing in the past few decades.

You can also use the logic that number of stickers on each page is known so if she used 3 large stickes at the front we are sure that number of small stickers on each page can be calculated that will result in 3x3x6=72. That leaves 89-72= 17 stickers remaining.\n- Here we can find answer by solving a simple equation X+3(1)-5X+10 = 0.\n- Another way to solve this question is by representing a problem with a system of equations.\n\n  X+Y = 4\n\n  X+4Y = 8\n\n  X+9Y = 12\n\n  X+36Y = 64\n\n- It is a division question where you need to divide something by 2 and then by 3. For example 20\u00f72 = 10 and then 10\u00f73 = -3. You can see the answer by using simple division or by finding out what are those numbers that are multiples of 6 which you can easily find through a multiplication. One such number is 18 where 18\u00f73 = 6 and 18\u00f72 = 9.\n- Just solve 23^2 =??. The answer is 276 because 8^(4x5) = 276 and 8 is the number of dots in 23.\n- Multiply 20 and 2. This is equivalent to moving the decimal point 2 times to the right and will result in 2000. Add the amounts given, namely 10, 750. Multiply 30 and 6, this is equivalent to moving the digit 2 places to the right. This sums up to $1800.  You can also add the amounts you receive", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}

I was able to find some flaws in the answers for some questions and after fixing those the code runs smoothly for the most part.\n*   I used several methods to improve the code. I first tried to implement `choice` function. This was the base of my code and I tried to add the condition on the choice question so that the questions will be answered according to that. Then I tried to implement the same method in `single` question which was a bit tricky I have to say. But as I have to work on the logic of the code I was able to achieve that. I also used the `for` loop method to implement the calculation part of the code.\n\n\n*   A very helpful resource was the link to the questions provided by Johnathan Zhang. Through this link I was able to understand the exact structure of the questions and make my code better.\n\n*   In addition to that, I went through a lot of articles that helped me in the understanding the exact structure of the code and the way the code should be approached. The first few articles were a struggle but later on I started to understand how these questions are supposed to be answered and how exactly to structure my code for better results.\n\n\n*  After working through this code with the `choice` question and trying out the logic behind it I was able to work on the `single` questions.

This will help me in approaching the questions confidently.\n* I will try to make sure that while working the code, I will not be biased towards any structure and try to find a code that fits perfectly with the question and is easy to solve in future.", "answer": "A: new hampshire"}

There were many problems that required math, however I wasn't sure how to figure the answer out. For example, one question needed us to find to the percentage of goals scored against Barcelona in Europe. I first tried answering the question using addition, but wasn't successful. Because math isn't an area of strength, I didn't even bother to try to figure out the answer to that problem.<n><n>### My Approach<n>While this method will most likely fail us in the future on coding challenges, it is the only method that I was able to complete. <n><n>### What Went Wrong?<n><n>For me, I got quite stuck on many of the problems because there were quite difficult. I would not consider myself to be very good at arithmetic, so that most likely had an impact on my success with this assignment.<n>

There are some good suggestions available about testing which I am considering adding as an extra part for the coding work for future submissions.<n>

One kilograms of dyes fruits cost $8. We are not told however, how many kilograms Nuts and dried fruits are bought, i.e., we are not told of what proportion they are. So we can't get this straight. But, as we have said, we can make a system of equation, based on the prices, to solve for the xN and xF.<n><n> So we have 2 equation now: $$2.5x = 8 $$<n> $$3x=12$$<n> And solving for them we will get respectively,<n> $$ x = 3.2 $$<n> $$ x = 4 $$<n> So xN and xF are 3.2 kilograms and 4 kilograms respectively.<n><n> Given that there are now 3 weights, we add xN and xF, to get:<n> $$3.2x + 4x = 5 $$<n> And solving we get $7.$ And so from the answer choices, which is in the multiples of 7, we can select answer choice B.<n><n> However, it would be easier to get the price of $70, directly from, let's say, nuts, by setting it to be 3 kilograms, and solving from there. So the equation is: $$2.50x=12$$ and solving, $x=4.8.$ The price of nuts is then $12\times 4.8=57.6$. Now since the price starts from 1 (and not 0), this is to be multiplied with 100, and so 4.8 is multip

In other words, if you pass a function that you defined anonymously back into itself (also known as recursion), your code will recalculate the second input value as many times as the first number.<n><n>To add a whole range of numbers (for example 1 through 10), you'll use a parameter that iterates the array automatically, letting you store each number for later.<n>Here's an example of passing an anonymous function back as a parameter using forEach.<n><n>const sum = numbers =>{<n>  return numbers.forEach( (n,i) =>{ <n>    return (i+1 ) + n; }} )<n>const total = sum([1,2,3;4,5,6])<n>console.log(total)<n><n>Output: 16 <n><n>### Explanation: Recursion is a special type of iteration that allows you to use the same argument as the start of the next call. You can use recursion to define functions that operate on themselves by passing function arguments to a function to recursively execute the current function argument.<n><n>Let's say you want to make 10 copies of string abc. You could iterate over each character from the string, adding in a, and then b, and then c. For each copy, you'll reiterate and add a, and then b and then c. For a 10th copy, you'll iterate again and add those three characters to your new copy:<n><n>var newString = "";<n>for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { <n>  newString += "abc";<n>}<n><n>newString<n>"abcabcdabcabcabcabc"<n><n>What if, instead of string, you had wanted to add 10 times for each element of an array?

The point is either the head ball or a ball on the side rail (the cushion ball). If you aim straight at the head ball you would call 1 pocket or object ball. If you aim at the cushion ball you would call slop. For example, if your opponent sunk the 5 ball you call 5 ball in the 1 hole or 5 ball in the sink in the hole. If the player sinks the 5 ball but bounces off the cushion ball, you would call 1 ball in the 6,7,8,9 hole which means the cushion ball didn't enter the hole itself. The cushion ball was used in order to bounce in a straight line to hit the main ball in the pocket. <n><n>### Bonust Question:  What was an obtuse triangle?<n>

Pure Predicate Problems<n><n>In this exercise we write our own predicates to solve the problems.<n><n>### Instruction: Read the instructions above. Write a program of your own that solves the problems using predicates.<n><n>########################################################<n>#2.  Constructors and Attributes<n>### Instruction<n><n>The class Person has the following attributes:<n><n>fullName=“Jason"<n>address: "123 Main St, Boston"<n>height: "6.2"<n><n>Write predicates that can be used to check whether an instance is a valid Person and,<n><n>- to find out the fullName of a Person<n>- to find out whether the street address is given<n>- to find out if the Person is tall, given the input height.<n><n>Use attributes or predicates. To test the validity of an instance, the input should follow exactly one of the formats below:<n><n>Person(“Jason" "123 Main Street, Boston" 6.2)<n>Person(“Jas”)<n>Person(“123 Main Street”)<n>Person(6.2)<n><n>Note that we expect the programmer to do simple checking such as ensuring that the attributes are used in the appropriate form.<n>Instead of providing exact error strings, you may simply write a predicate that throws<n>a suitable error. Alternatively, you can just use assert to stop the program if an invalid instance is used.<n><n>In particular, if the user enters a Person instance without "6.2" for the height, <n>you must throw a suitable error (i.e., the attribute must have a String value).<n><n>You should not include more than five predicates and five attributes.<n>You can either add attributes or write predicates.<n>For example, you can write a predicate called hasHeight, which has the arguments<n>person to be checked and a String height.  It succeeds if there exists a height attribute<n>of type string with the person, and the attribute contains the given height string given.<n><n>Your program should have a main() function that tests examples.  One way that you may <n>do this is to build a list of examples that you want to test.  You may refer to your book<n>for an implementation of such a list.<n>(In the

If we spend $12 for 3 kg of nuts, and $8 for 2.5 kg of fruits, we would have spent a total of $61.<n><n>This explanation is incorrect because it overlooked that the kilograms were different weights.<n><n>## 2. Johnson spends 1 hour at the gym 3 days a week. One third of the weightlifting time is spent warming up and doing other types of exercise.

Choices:  A: revealing information B: being ridiculed C: problems D: more funding E: telling all<n>Output:		E<n><n><n>### Answer Explanations<n><n>1.<n>The total price of nuts and fruits bought is 3 * 12 + 2.5 * 8 = 56.<n>2.<n>Since 3 times a week means that he works out 3 times a week, he works out for 12x3 hours per week. <n>3.<n>A more reasonable 20% is 20/100 = 1/5, so it costs 200*(1+1/5) = 480.<n>4.<n>The players scored an equal number. If they scored a goal and the percentage of total goals equal 20%, then the total number of goal is 300/20 = 15; so we have the same problem as in #2, which is<n>the number of goals each player took is 15/2.<n>5.<n>20% of 3600 = 20/1 = 1000<n>Each person drinks 12 * 5 = 60 ounces of soda daily. The rest is 64 * 7 = 448 ounces of water and<n>the total amount is 6000 ounces.<n>6.<n>In 4 hours, since each person worked for 250 blocks/hour, each person took 250 * 4 = 100 blocks. With 6000/1000=6 blocks,<n>23 extra people took 23*100=2300 blocks altogether, which means that they took the whole truck, and the whole time was used, so the time was 4 hours.<n>7.<n>A is correct, since the companies will have greater exposure to the public.<n>

By the question we have that<n>$$<n>3 kg + 2.5 kg  \,=\, \, n_1 \cdot 3 + n_2 \cdot 2.5<n>$$<n>Hence<n>$$<n>5 kg  \,=\,\frac{25}{3+2.5}<n>$$<n>$$<n>\frac{25}{1.25}<n>$$<n>We get that<n>$$<n>5 kg/1250  (5 pounds/120 ounce)  \,=\, $\$1.25<n>$$<n>Half the nut will be $\$1.20 $. It is reasonable to assume that the price of nuts being a bit more expensive than the price of dried fruit. If we round the problem we will get the answer $5.26 $.<n><n>#### Question 2:<n><n>Let $T_w$ be the weekly time for weightlifting and $T_{wu}$, $T_{c}$ be the week times for warming up and doing gym activity respectively.<n><n>According to the problem, if his weight is time $3hr $, then in 1 week he will spent $3 \cdot 7 = 21$. By hypothesis, he needs to spent $\frac{21}{3}=\frac{7}{2}$ time for warming up and cardio. Therefore,<n><n>$$<n>\frac3{2}.7=5<n>$$<n>#### Question 3:<n><n><n><n>#### Question 4:<n><n><n><n>

There are people who have poor health, however, due to some or other causes, resulting in ailments. But such people can come out of these ailments and the best way in which they can do so is by adopting good health habits. Eating sensibly, sleeping and resting well, and taking regular and proper exercise are three principal things that people should do in order to regain or maintain a healthy body.<n><n>Eating sensibly means taking food in moderate quantity, which is rich in nutrients, thus helping in a healthy growth of the body. Food should neither be eaten too little, nor too much to obtain nutritious values. In order to maintain sound health, the food that is consumed should be balanced between the protein and carbohydrates.<n><n>Sleep and rest are also essential constituents towards good health. People who do not rest or do not sleep properly can suffer from problems related to eyesight, headaches, and digestion. In order to get ample rest, a person should have sound sleep for at least eight hours of every night. Sound sleep helps to replenish the body against loss of vitamins and helps a lot in preventing wear and tear for mental and physical health. Another way of getting proper rest is by taking a few minutes away from work or studies and just relaxing or listening to music.<n><n>A healthy body depends completely on the regular and proper exercise of the body. Exercise helps the muscles to relax and gives a freshness to the body by removing the weariness. Daily exercise is necessary in order to remain healthy. People may have to exercise their muscles by running, jogging, cycling, dancing, playing video games or anything they like to do, but they should keep in mind that exercise is crucial to remain fit and healthy.<n>

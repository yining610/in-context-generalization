There were many problems that required math, however I wasn't sure how to figure the answer out. For example, one question needed us to find to the percentage of goals scored against Barcelona in Europe. I first tried answering the question using addition, but wasn't successful. Because math isn't an area of strength, I didn't even bother to try to figure out the answer to that problem.\n\n### My Approach\nWhile this method will most likely fail us in the future on coding challenges, it is the only method that I was able to complete. \n\n### What Went Wrong?\n\nFor me, I got quite stuck on many of the problems because there were quite difficult. I would not consider myself to be very good at arithmetic, so that most likely had an impact on my success with this assignment.", "answer": "A: circus"}

One kilograms of dyes fruits cost $8. We are not told however, how many kilograms Nuts and dried fruits are bought, i.e., we are not told of what proportion they are. So we can't get this straight. But, as we have said, we can make a system of equation, based on the prices, to solve for the xN and xF.\n\n So we have 2 equation now: $$2.5x = 8 $$\n $$3x=12$$\n And solving for them we will get respectively,\n $$ x = 3.2 $$\n $$ x = 4 $$\n So xN and xF are 3.2 kilograms and 4 kilograms respectively.\n\n Given that there are now 3 weights, we add xN and xF, to get:\n $$3.2x + 4x = 5 $$\n And solving we get $7.$ And so from the answer choices, which is in the multiples of 7, we can select answer choice B.\n\n However, it would be easier to get the price of $70, directly from, let's say, nuts, by setting it to be 3 kilograms, and solving from there. So the equation is: $$2.50x=12$$ and solving, $x=4.8.$ The price of nuts is then $12\\times 4.8=57.6$.

Functions typically do one of the following:\n\n* Calculate a response.\n* Handle a user action.\n\nFunctions in JavaScript can take multiple inputs (arguments), which we\u2019ll also talk about later today. Let\u2019s now look at what a function looks like visually.\n\n### How to define Function?\nThe syntax for a function definition follows this format:\n`function name () { statments }`\n\nThere are a couple of rules you need to", "answer": "C: closer"}

In other words, if you pass a function that you defined anonymously back into itself (also known as recursion), your code will recalculate the second input value as many times as the first number.\n\nTo add a whole range of numbers (for example 1 through 10), you'll use a parameter that iterates the array automatically, letting you store each number for later.\nHere's an example of passing an anonymous function back as a parameter using forEach.\n\nconst sum = numbers =>{\n  return numbers.forEach( (n,i) =>{ \n    return (i+1 ) + n; }} )\nconst total = sum([1,2,3;4,5,6])\nconsole.log(total)\n\nOutput: 16 \n\n### Explanation: Recursion is a special type of iteration that allows you to use the same argument as the start of the next call. You can use recursion to define functions that operate on themselves by passing function arguments to a function to recursively execute the current function argument.\n\nLet's say you want to make 10 copies of string abc. You could iterate over each character from the string, adding in a, and then b, and then c. For each copy, you'll reiterate and add a, and then b and then c. For a 10th copy, you'll iterate again and add those three characters to your new copy:\n\nvar newString = \"\";\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { \n  newString += \"abc\";\n}\n\nnewString\n\"abcabcdabcabcabcabc\"\n\nWhat if, instead of string, you had wanted to add 10 times for each element of an array?

As we know that 4 and 8 are both even, this implies that the sum of the numbers is the \nsum of the other number 4 + 8 and even therefore true. \n\n1 AND 3. This statement is false, because of -2 in the equation which is \nnegating the numbers and thus creating an odd number. \n\n2 AND 5. This is true, because of 4 and 8\n\n3 AND 5. This statement is true because, of -2\n\n\n##### Answer: D", "answer": "A: street"}

If you aim at the cushion ball you would call slop. For example, if your opponent sunk the 5 ball you call 5 ball in the 1 hole or 5 ball in the sink in the hole. If the player sinks the 5 ball but bounces off the cushion ball, you would call 1 ball in the 6,7,8,9 hole which means the cushion ball didn't enter the hole itself.

Pure Predicate Problems\n\nIn this exercise we write our own predicates to solve the problems.\n\n### Instruction: Read the instructions above. Write a program of your own that solves the problems using predicates.\n\n########################################################\n#2.  Constructors and Attributes\n### Instruction\n\nThe class Person has the following attributes:\n\nfullName=\u201cJason\"\naddress: \"123 Main St, Boston\"\nheight: \"6.2\"\n\nWrite predicates that can be used to check whether an instance is a valid Person and,\n\n- to find out the fullName of a Person\n- to find out whether the street address is given\n- to find out if the Person is tall, given the input height.\n\nUse attributes or predicates. To test the validity of an instance, the input should follow exactly one of the formats below:\n\nPerson(\u201cJason\" \"123 Main Street, Boston\" 6.2)\nPerson(\u201cJas\u201d)\nPerson(\u201c123 Main Street\u201d)\nPerson(6.2)\n\nNote that we expect the programmer to do simple checking such as ensuring that the attributes are used in the appropriate form.\nInstead of providing exact error strings, you may simply write a predicate that throws\na suitable error. Alternatively, you can just use assert to stop the program if an invalid instance is used.\n\nIn particular, if the user enters a Person instance without \"6.2\" for the height, \nyou must throw a suitable error (i.e., the attribute must have a String value).\n\nYou should not include more than five predicates and five attributes.\nYou can either add attributes or write predicates.\nFor example, you can write a predicate called hasHeight, which has the arguments\nperson to be checked and a String height.  It succeeds if there exists a height attribute\nof type string with the person, and the attribute contains the given height string given.\n\nYour program should have a main() function that tests examples.  One way that you may \ndo this is to build a list of examples that you want to test.  You may refer to your book\nfor an implementation of such a list.\n(In the", "answer": "D: foot"}

Average of Two Integers](http://www.spoj.com/problems/average/)\n\n### Problem statement:\n\nComputer scientists often measure integers by the average value of the bits they are composed of, which is known as their Hamming weight. For instance, 478 = 1000000100010110 is a binary representation of 478, as can be represented as 4/7 + 8/16.\n\nHowever, if any of bits are 0, their Hamming weight, will be 0. Therefore, we can say that the Hamming weight of 478 is 6.5 or 3.5.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's call 1/0 1.\n\nExample:\n\nSolution?\n\n### Solution Summary:\n\n\n\n\n## 5.

This gives us a solution of 30. If you are not familiar with the shortcut for 20 percent, that is 1/5.\n\nA shortcut trick to solve this is to put 6000 blocks in a truck at the rate of 75 blocks per hour by 8 people at the rate of 3 hours per person. How many hours does filling the truck take total?\n\nAs you might have guessed, it takes 25 hours to fill up a truck:\n\n  $answers = 6000/75*3; \n  echo \"B\";\n\n\nOkay, last question:\n\nStella and Twinkle fill the truck at a rate of 75 stone blocks per hour per person; they work for three hours and are then joined in by six other people who also work like them.

Example: 5 is prime. 5=2x5. 2x5=10 which is 5 (number) multiplied with itself. 1 is the first factor, 5 is the second factor.\nA good way to test whether or not a number has exactly 2 factors is to try and check if the number is divisible by other numbers, from 1 to the square root of the number.\nFor example: 4 = 2x2 = 4.

If we spend $12 for 3 kg of nuts, and $8 for 2.5 kg of fruits, we would have spent a total of $61.\n\nThis explanation is incorrect because it overlooked that the kilograms were different weights.\n\n## 2. Johnson spends 1 hour at the gym 3 days a week. One third of the weightlifting time is spent warming up and doing other types of exercise. It's safe to call the remaining time spent lifting weights, and because he lifts weights 3 days a week, he would have spent 3 hours a week lifting weights.\n\n### The correct answer was 4\n\n# ### Answer explanation\n\n## 3.

So the fuel price changes from 200 * x/100 to 200 * (1.20)x/100 = 480.\n\nFor part4, he needs to sum up all goals scores from at least two players in a league season, he gets 20% of the total goal scores if the equal number of goals are scored by the same one, then all goal scores can be calculated as 20% * 300 = 60.\n\nFor Part 5, he drinks 7 12 oz cans and 64 oz water a day. Assuming there are 6 days, he drinks a total of 7 * 12 + (3 * 8), equals to 86.\n\nFor Part6, the truck has a capacity of 6k stone blocks. Let's suppose the time taken by Stella and Twink were equal. So it takes 250/h per person and takes 60,000/250h or 240 hours to fill up such a truck. And when another 6 joins, they can complete the task in 60,014/225h = 5 hours.\n\nFor Part7,\nThe last part in the question is ambiguous in the question. I will assume", "answer": "B: singing"}

If they scored a goal and the percentage of total goals equal 20%, then the total number of goal is 300/20 = 15; so we have the same problem as in #2, which is\nthe number of goals each player took is 15/2.\n5.\n20% of 3600 = 20/1 = 1000\nEach person drinks 12 * 5 = 60 ounces of soda daily.

With 6000/1000=6 blocks,\n23 extra people took 23*100=2300 blocks altogether, which means that they took the whole truck, and the whole time was used, so the time was 4 hours.\n7.\nA is correct, since the companies will have greater exposure to the public.", "answer": "D: more funding"}

We can start by finding all possible values $x$ corresponding to the input we are given, and we can do it systematically. But, if the solution is unique, then there is no need to do any systematic search, and we can just directly answer the question. For example, given Input (1), Output (56) is its solution.\n\nIn all of them, we have to guess the answer from a set of choices. However, if there are too many choices, we still have to do systematic search. For example, given Output (1), we can only consider the first, second, and third choices.\n\n### Solution For Input 1:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\nclass ExamSolution1:\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def solve(input: List[str]) -> str:\n        if isinstance(input, str):\n            return input, None, None\n        elif isinstance(input, int):\n            return None, None, input\n        elif isinstance([input[0] for input in input.values()], float):\n            return None\n        elif is_unique_num(input): return Outputs[input]\n        elif is_multiple_inputs(input): return Output0 if any([any([input[0][0] in CHOICES for CHOICES in choice_list]) for choice_list in Outputs]) else Output1\n        else: raise not_implemented(\"Input\", type(input))\n\n    @static method\n    def is_unique_num (list_input: List[str]):\n        input_values = map(lambda input: input[0", "answer": "C: body armor"}

Right now it can do 1 out of the 8 questions that I had initially posted on the [Udacity forums](https://slack-api.udacity.com/). In particular it gives us an output.\n\n---\n## How does it work?\n\n`ALPGHAG` works by running the input through a `slack-client`, which is the program I developed and ran in the [Udacity course](http://learn.udacity.com). Essentially you can provide the program with a series of commands, such as **`set`**, **`say`**, **`list`** and **`input`** and it will generate and compile the output appropriately.\n\nWhen you run the program it takes the number that you have written as a command and passes it via the `send` function to the Slack interface, which will then parse it and give you the answer back.\n\nTo do this `ALPHAGO` imports the `slack-client` package.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n`pip install AlphaGo`", "answer": "C: bound"}
{"idx": 950, "text": "C:\n\n### Discussion:\n\n### Instruction:Read the following passage and choose the correct answers.\n\nIt is a well-accepted fact that good health is essential to maintain physical and mental stability. There are people who have poor health, however, due to some or other causes, resulting in ailments. But such people can come out of these ailments and the best way in which they can do so is by adopting good health habits. Eating sensibly, sleeping and resting well, and taking regular and proper exercise are three principal things that people should do in order to regain or maintain a healthy body.\n\nEating sensibly means taking food in moderate quantity, which is rich in nutrients, thus helping in a healthy growth of the body. Food should neither be eaten too little, nor too much to obtain nutritious values. In order to maintain sound health, the food that is consumed should be balanced between the protein and carbohydrates.\n\nSleep and rest are also essential constituents towards good health. People who do not rest or do not sleep properly can suffer from problems related to eyesight, headaches, and digestion. In order to get ample rest, a person should have sound sleep for at least eight hours of every night. Sound sleep helps to replenish the body against loss of vitamins and helps a lot in preventing wear and tear for mental and physical health. Another way of getting proper rest is by taking a few minutes away from work or studies and just relaxing or listening to music.\n\nA healthy body depends completely on the regular and proper exercise of the body. Exercise helps the muscles to relax and gives a freshness to the body by removing the weariness. Daily exercise is necessary in order to remain healthy. People may have to exercise their muscles by running, jogging, cycling, dancing, playing video games or anything they like to do, but they should keep in mind that exercise is crucial to remain fit and healthy.", "answer": "C: with people"}

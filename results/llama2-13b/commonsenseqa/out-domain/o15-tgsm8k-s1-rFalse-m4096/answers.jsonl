{"idx": 15, "text": "A\n##### Solution:\nWe can see that the answer has a very clear theme - they all consist of an object and a noun. We'll want to filter down these answers to the ones that make sense.\n\nLooking at A, B, C, and D - they would all make sense as a noun.\n\nLooking to E- it would make sense as well, but as a garden is out of doors - the word, \"aromas\" is quite contradictory.\n\nLooking back at our last question:\n\n\"Aromas always drew him towards the garden.\"\n\nIf you read in this case \"Aromas is what drew him to the garden,\" A would make a lot more sense than E. Thus, we can eliminate E.\n\nLet's look at C. \"Kitchen\" sounds like a room, but it doesn't make sense in context with the other answers. Furthermore, \"aromas\" isn't something that is usually found in the kitchen in this case. We can eliminate this choice.\n\nThis brings us to A and B \"yard\" and \"basement\". We know that a \"room\" could consist of either \"yard\" or \"basement\", but we also know that \"aromas\" don't usually have anything to do with either of A and B. Hence, we can eliminate both of them.\n\nWhile D can make sense, it seems as if the original sentence is in need of some modification. For example, it could be \"living room\" to make the most sense out of this set of answers. Thus, we can cross off D.\n\nAs a result, you would land on A.", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

She was a remarkable person long before the events in the bus took place. As a little girl, Rosa was a very thoughtful, bright and selfless person. She loved to read about freedom because she knew that slavery was wrong.\n\nShe also believed that African Americans should have exactly the same rights as white people but things were very different in that time. Slavery wasn't abolished in the USA until 1865. But although slavery was abolished in 1865, this did not mean all African Americans were truly free.\n\nIn 1900, just before Rosa was 16, a law was introduced called the 'Jim Crow' law. This law made an effort to stop black and white American's from mixing and it also made segregation an illegal practice. \n\nMany states didn't agree with this law and even before President Woodrow Wilson allowed this law to stay in existence, there were more than 5000 Jim Crow laws. Even though Rosa was born in 1913, many states in the United States still had Jim Crow laws. As a teenager, Rosa was very confused about the situation, she thought African-American people should be allowed to get a better job and education. Also, she disagreed with the idea that there had to be two separate schools for black and white people, she believed everyone should have the same opportunity to achieve their dreams.\n\n\n\nInput: What is the central idea behind this excerpt?\nOptions:\n\nInput: A.

Break the instruction and find what we need to calculate **Output** from it (i.e. **17** in current problem)\n2. Find the key words and terms we need to **solve** (i.e. number of teams: **14**  / number of goals: **82**)\n3.

This problem has provided us with some key informations.\n\n- Team A has \"x\" amount of goals, so does team B\n- Team C has 13 more goals than team A\n- Team B has twice the amount of goals as team C\n- Therefore, we have these equations:\n\n<div markdown=1>\n\n**Team A:** A = goal_x (x is unknown, we will find out soon)\n\n**Team C:** C = 13 + x\n\n**Team B**\nB = 2 * x\n\n</div>\n\nThe **B** represents the sum of both team's goals, but we only know that number from the information in this question.

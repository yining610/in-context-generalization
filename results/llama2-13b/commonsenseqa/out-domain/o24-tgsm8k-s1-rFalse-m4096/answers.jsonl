The [Maine Department of Marine Resources](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/commercial/fisheries/regional.html) has a list of a variety of seafoods that can only be found off the East Coast of North America. The website specifically mentions the Maine shrimp, which is only harvested in the Gulf of Maine, in the area off Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and part of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\n\nFor another example, I think you would mostly associate Maine as being a good source of lobster as well as a lot of fish. The lobster are found at the coastal areas, and the fish are found in the rivers close to the coast. You'll also find scallops, scrod, and dogfish off the east coast of NorthAmerica as well.\nFor more information about these seafoods, read more about each of these foods at the [Maine Department of marine Resources](https://www2.maine.gov). If the question mentioned that they wanted to use the seafood to make a stew or some kind of soupe, then shrimp, lobsters, and scallops would be good combinations.\n####### Let's move on to the next question.\n\n###### You will get 1 hour to answer 8 questions for Section 1, all multiple choice, with 17 minutes per question.", "answer": "A: maine"}

{"idx": 76, "text": "c \n\n### Recommended Approach\n\nFor the questions that ask for a final number you should divide the whole number by the whole number and use integers only. When the question asks for a percentage value you should use the `float` datatype since these numbers aren`t necessarily integers. The questions that ask for a `list` value shouldn't use `eval` for the solution as it is very inefficient and will be flagged.\n\n**Ex.** \n\nThe question is asking to get the average amount of the time from two different games.  Assume the user inputs `hours=[['2', '5', '1', '4', '6', '2']]` and `minutes=[['200', '165', '100', '300', '400']]`, this would get you the answer `2.3 hours` because `(hours * minutes) / (2 * 60 * 60) / len(hours)`\n\nHere is the code for the question:\n\n```java\ndef averageTime(hours, minutes):\n    hours = [int(n) for n in hours]\n    minutes = [int(n)] for n in minutes\n        \n    return (float(hours * minutes) * 60 *60) / len(((hours * minutes)))\n    \nprint(f\"Your average time was {averageTime(hours,minutes)}\")\n```\n\n### Example:  \n\n**Input:** [[2, '5'], ['2', '145'], [2, '1']]\n\n**Output:**.91\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\nInput: Slim Shady has $25,325 in his checking.

What is the age of the older brother now in years?\nOutput: The older brother is 19 years old this year. He will be 20 by the end of this year. In addition, if this year is 2019, the age of the oldest brother will be a multiple of 4, just as 19 is a multiple of 4. This means that the older brother is 8 years older than the youngest brother. Thus, the youngest brother is 7 years old in this year. Thus, the second brother is 15 this year. Because the older brother is a multiple of 5, his age must be 9 or 14 years. Because 14 is not a multiple of 4 (therefore the age of the youngest cannot be 8), the older and only other possible age is 9. The second and final condition of being a multiple of 4 is satisfied. Therefore, the age of the second brother must be 14, while the older brother must simply be 9 in this year.\n\nInput: A boy goes on a rollercoaster and his car travels 450 feet up a hill and takes 2 minutes to ascend to the", "answer": "C: party"}

The most frequently occurring character within the column will have the most 1s.  \n\nTherefore, if column c0 has more 1s than any of the other columns, choose k equal to c0. \n\nIf no column has more 1s in their respective column than column c0, then choose k equal to cmin (column c1, column c2, column c3, etc.), and choose k equal to c1 if there is a tie.\n\n## Video Walkthrough\n\n```python\n# Definition for an iterator.\n# class Iterator:\n#     def __init__(self, iterable): self.dictionary =", "answer": "C: playroom"}

Then on the next line, you're looking up an index for letter e, but the line ends with an r. This is what would crash your code when you try to look up the 9 r.\n\nThe same goes for the next line, 29, 30, the one after that as well.

In other words, there's a mistake in almost every line of your test data (you should review how you input your test data).\n\nThe second problem is that you use a `while` loop to do `len` on the first line and, apparently, you don't want to run `len` on the second line if you did on the first line.

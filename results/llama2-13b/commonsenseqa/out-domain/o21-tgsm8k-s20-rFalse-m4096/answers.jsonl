Tapanga has eight more candies than Core which equates to 8 - 16 = -8, so Corey has 17 candies. However, to find out 29, we have to do 8 + 17 = 25. I am not 100% sure that I am correct, but I do believe I got the logic right.\nOutput: 25\n\nInput: Since I was not sure about my previous one, I did this one two times in two different ways. The first time, I went with 20% of 1.20, giving me a result of.40. Then I went with a total of 1.29 for a 25% increase over 1 month, giving me a 1.29 total. Then, again I did another 600, to get a total of 1066, and then another one for a total of 941. The result is that the final money made would be 44/941 = 4.65%.\nOutput: 941\n\nInput: The answer for this one should be 100% since all 800 books were not sold, then we can simply go with 100% = 800/600 = 5/4. 45 + 41 = 86", "answer": "A: person"}

If an athlete runs a distance of 10km during training, how many kilometers does an athlete run in his actual meets?\n\n5km\n13km\n10km\n9km\nAnswer: 13km\n\nThe total distance in training is 270 km and this is to the actual training.

So 2.28 x 5 days will give me 11 hours and 14 minutes 11:14\nSo if a working day is 8 hours, you have to times 8 hours by the 2.28 and you get 17:52 which rounded to 18 hours, so I'd go with 18 hours.\nQuestion 4 of 30\nIt takes 1 hour for water to boil for a meal.

We don't know whether you've started programming and realized you don't know where to start, or are well into a code that seems to fail for some inscrutable reason. This isn't a place for \"please solve my homework problem for me\". It's a place where you can ask, \"I have this code here, and I'm trying to do X, but the output I'm seeing isn't consistent with that; what could be wrong?\"\n\nComment: In the line that starts \"My understanding so far is\", did you mean to write \"[...]\"? There's no place anywhere near there where it would make any sense for you to write \"so far\"?! That line is just an extra piece of random text that makes it harder for people who might consider answering to understand your question.\n\nComment: (cont'd) That's how it looks on your end, maybe because it appears directly beneath the \"My program\" section. On the other hand, there's no reason for this to be a new paragraph as far as what the computer can tell by reading just the words, so for the computer that may be interpreted as a new line for some reason (like the space after the \"12 questions\" word may not have gone through to produce a paragraph break). If that were true, then \"so far\" would become the first text on the second line, making very little sense in context.\n\nComment: You may want to post this question to https://codereview.stackexchange.com/ instead, but before you do", "answer": "A: wage war"}

Are you new to this site?\n\nComment: I started from september 2015\n\nAnswer: What I would start with is taking into consideration that it's supposed to pass test cases (a type of questions that you have to answer), so I would start with writing a couple of `test cases`. You should do that at the beginning of your `main()` function.\n\nFor example, the first test case:\n\n\\begin{code}\nSystem.out.println(\"Tapanga and Corey \"\n    + \"have 66 candies \"\n    + \"together. \"\n    + \"However, Tapanga \"\n    + \"has 8 more candies \"\n    \"than Corey. \"\n    +\"How many candies does Core\"\n    +\"y have?\"\n    +\"? \");\nSystem.out.print(\"OUT: \");\n\\end{code }\n\nThis is what I would write first. It might seem like a lot of useless work, but actually it isn't. First of all I took a look at the questions from your `instruction`, and I noticed that they will all have a similar `structure`, e.g.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nTapanga and Coreya\n    have 66 candiesa\n  together. However, Tapa\"\n  +\"nga has 8 more candiesa \"\n  +\"than Coreya.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSo", "answer": "D: attractive appearance"}

A better title might be \"Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question\", because the question you show doesn't seem to fit the answer you display. (I also don't understand what the answer is supposed to show.) But in any case, it sounds like you are asking whether there is a way to identify the correct answer from seeing only the correct answer, not knowing anything about the other questions.\n\nIn a typical multiple choice question, there will be two numbers which are related in such a way that if they are not exactly the same value, but you add, subtract, multiply, or divide one by the other, the result will be $0$. So if you take $10$ for the question you have quoted, and $9$ as one of the possible answers, dividing $10$ by $9$ gets you:\n\n$$10/9=1.111 \\dots $$ which isn't $0$, so the answer can't be $9$. Or if a possible answer was $\\frac{54}{67}$, and you multiply that by $\\frac{9}{11}$, you get:\n\n$$\\frac{54}{9*67}=\\frac{54}{599}$$ which is closer to $0$ than any positive fraction, so this is more likely to be the right answer.\n\nThe problem is that not all answers use this strategy, so you should have several possible ways of checking, like reading and re-reading the entire question, reading the answer options to check which one fits best, and so on.\n\nComment: Thanks for your reply and that strategy as well of finding and eliminating the answer from the list.", "answer": "C: income"}

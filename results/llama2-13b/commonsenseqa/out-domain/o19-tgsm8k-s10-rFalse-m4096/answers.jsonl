Aside from keyboard input, the other main source of input is an XML file. An XML file is a very common data format around which computers can operate and perform certain tasks on the data. In the course and for this lab, we use XML to represent the input and output. The purpose of these XML files is to have a common format in which the solution process can work across multiple types of inputs or questions, rather than having to change the code repeatedly. The solution process we are going to see is called a _solver_. For example, a solver can take a multiple choice test like this, where the question and the possible answers are stored in XML. Then, a program can use the solver to scan through all options, identify the correct one, and then display that answer. The solver will perform that task for many different tests, regardless of the number of options in the test or the details of how the questions are phrased. The specifics of the problem can be changed only when the input is updated.\n\n\n### Task\n### Step 1. Identify and understand the XML file\n\nThe sample XML file for this lab is part.xer inside of your git repository. To view the XML file in your browser, go to your project URL inside of your web developer console with the path to the XML file, part.xer.\n\nHere is what the file looks like in an XML Editor:\n\n![step 1 xml example](assets/xmlExample1.png)\n\nThe XML starts with an encoding definition. This indicates the source code encoding that is used by the XML. Then, the XML file declares the element names and attributes used in the file. These will be used to reference specific parts of the XML for later processing. This is how we reference parts of the XML like this:\n\n```\n<option>B</option>\n```\n\n#### Attributes\nAttributes can be used", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}

He has used five different fonts for headings, subheadings, paragraphs, signatures, and letter address. If you count every \"character\" in a font as a letter, how many letters has Danny used in his letter?\n\n1. 140\n2. 120\n3. 76\n4. 150\n5. None of the Above\n\\end{code}\n\nMy attempts/thoughts:\n\nAnswer number 4 (C) is 150, since the five different fonts contain 30 letters each, and 30 x 5 = 150.  Answer question 2 is D, which is 5 if you use a font where each character (letter) is 1 letter.\n\nIf I were to write 3 pages in a word document, I would use one font for the page number, another font for the beginning of each line, one for the title of the document, one for the document text, and one in place of a signature.  This is the reason why I think Danny used 5, since an individual font would equal 30 letters (the 5th choice.)\n\nI can't really confirm answer number 4, since I would have to find a total number of letters in each font to see if the number is always consistent with 30.\n\nAnswer number 1 (A) is definitely wrong if we look at the number.  The question asks if it has a \"lot\" of fire extinguisher, so I know there wouldn't be 100 since that wouldn't be a sufficient amount.  I ruled out (C) and (D) pretty quickly as well, since those numbers seem too low for a building that large.  If I could find out the numbers from (B) and (E), that might also allow me to be more confident in my answer choices\n\nAnswer number 5 (E), I believe should be either number 1 or 2.

First, you purchased a cooler so you could transport all of your supplies in one place.  You have purchased an abundance of cans of 409 cleaner, because this will be used not only to disinfect wounds, but also clean your hands after contact with zombie skin.  Your next stop is at the local sporting goods store so you can pick up a baseball to knock unconscious any zombie that gets too close.  To protect yourself against zombie bites, you purchase a full set of winter weather gear because there is so much wool from clothing that is scratchy and helps repel zombie bites.  The last items for your kit required a stop at the nearest grocery store: an enormous roll of bubble wrap for when you come across an abandoned car and the 22-pound sack of potatoes which will be used as ammunition, since the tough outer shell of the potato and the large size will make great projectiles against a zombie.  It has taken you a few days to get all of these items but you are feeling quite accomplished.  You are ready for the zombie attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the car, you carefully arrange all of the items in the cooler so that you will be ready for the zombies.  Then you securely close the cooler with a couple of bungee cords so that none of the items can fall out along the way.

{"idx": 308, "text": "C\n\n### Instruction:Read the following instructions and translate them into Python code.\n\nTo start off, you will define a variable called output with the value 0. Then, create a variable called input and assign the value \"35\". Next, add a variable to the function called choices. Make this value equal to \"[A, B, C, D, E]\". Finally, define a variable called user_choice. Next, use a conditional statement to ask the user what they would like as their appraisal. Give them 5 choices, representing each letter of their answer. Ask the user to input their answer. Once they do so, you must convert their answer to a number so you can compare their answer to the choices with equal letters.  For example, if they type \u201cA\u201d, you would convert this to the number 0 because \u201cA\u201d was the 0th option in your choices variable above. To do this, use the \u201cord(user_choice)\u201d keyword. This will return the integer value of that letter, so in this case you would get the number 97.  Then, use your conditional statement to compare the number that was returned with each element of this new list that was defined. If it matches one of these elements, add 50 to your output, which we still have the value \"0\". If it doesn\u2019t, output \"25\" since that was the next option defined.  You now need to convert this 0 or 25 into the string you want (the final output value). Do this by adding an extra str() to output. Do so in your main function where you define the output variable.  You\u2019re required to use the int modulus operator as seen above and use the code from the example below.

There are a number of problems where you can't use `split`, and one problem that's simply wrong (it asks what to explore space in, that seems to be asking for a type of space shuttle). Is there anything I can do to fix this?\n\nComment: I guess every question has a number as a value. The question text is not variable.\n\nComment: For your first sentence : \"if I ask a programmer for an integer he will give me an integer\" is just not true. As soon as you see \"integer i = 0\" you see that the programmer is declaring a variable, not giving you some value. You should not confuse \"variables\" and \"values\" (or \"meanings\") in programming. The same would be true in algebra (where you will often see the symbol \"=\" in the place where you would expect \"=\" in programming), or math in general.\n\nComment: Are these test questions in english or are they in a different language?\n\nComment: @jpm They're in English\n\nComment: @Mawg Then what's wrong with `s=split(questions[i])`? Your answer in comments was \"split does not work\". The second function will do the same work as the first one.\n\nComment: @KrzysztofCicho\u0144ski It doesn't do the same work.  I get an error trying to use it for the second one.\n\nComment\n\nComment: @NigelMorgan Yes you probably were.

See my answer.\n\nAnswer: The purpose of the `input` variable is to provide data to your Python script.\n\nThis input can be provided by the Python's `raw_input` function, or by reading from a file.\n\nThe second purpose of such input, is to be able to feed the data into the Python script from the Command Line Interface (CLI). You can do this by creating a Python script and placing it in a directory where it should be executable by the CLI.\n\nThe Python script can then be launched from the CLI.\n\nFor example:\n\n\\begin{code}\n$ python myscript.py\n\\end{code}\\em{This will cause the input prompt.}\n\nAnswer: Input and output are two of the main ways a program exchanges data with its user.\n\nInput is how a program requests data from its user and it can either take place with a function of Python or be directly by the CLI (command line interface).\n\nIn your case, I think you are supposed to read the input prompts from some file.", "answer": "B: desk"}

Researchers from MIT\u2019s CSAIL group have designed the \u201cHuggable Bugs\u201d\u2014or robots that are programmed to imitate a child\u2019s real-life friend. Huggable Bugs are programmed through the machine-learning method \u201cimitation learning,\u201d where a robot studies how a child navigates his or her living room and then mimics it.  The results were shown at an Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) conference in San Diego last month. So far, researchers have been running their prototypes\u2019 behavior by human volunteers. But with more recent advancements, a child can now program his or her new robotic friend through a game.The child guides a virtual bee around the room using an iOS or Android app. The Huggable Bug will then mimic the bee\u2019s actions in an animated and physical way. \u201cThe idea is to get the kid to teach the robot this game\u2026but also to have a lot of fun doing it,\u201d says MIT\u2019s Cynthia Breazeal, who led the Huggable Bugs project. Breazeal, an associate professor of media arts and sciences, has been developing the concept for nearly 20 years. She began the project by studying how kids learn and make friends in 1996, as a PhD student at MIT\u2019s AI Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s like, how do young kids develop that social behavior, [which] is to some degree based on social reciprocity, which is what we\u2019re trying to program into the robot,\u201d Breazeal says. Children teach the robot through touch, an idea that Breazeal says originated from research into social development in autistic kids. Breazeal also says that Huggable Bugs aren\u2019t designed to resemble human shape. In 2009, the Toyota Financial Services (TFS) announced an investment in MIT\u2019s Huggable Bugs. TFS also provided resources for an earlier Huggable Bugs robot\u2014Mirow\u2014which was made to help socially-challenged kids learn and understand ver", "answer": "B: motel room"}

If two implementations compile to equivalent byte code, then they behave equivalent. \\strong{The only difference between your program and the sample solutions is their byte code.

The teacher and the mother both like to spend summers on a farm at a resort hotel and on the day they arrived, a huge thunderstorm developed and there was a sudden power outage.  There was a backup power system for emergencies but unfortunately the backup system ran out of power.  There were dozens of guests at the resort who were enjoying a weeklong summer family vacation and had no food left in their refrigerators.  The guests had brought a lot of food with them, but the food was lost due to the storm. Also, the storm destroyed the roof of the main building's kitchen which had a huge oven used to cook for everybody.  It was too dangerous for anybody to make a fire anywhere inside the building because of sparks flying everywhere. This was a serious problem and as a result many more guests called the resort hotel and canceled  their reservations.  Some of the guests had decided to stay home and not risk it due to the storm.  The guests who decided to stay were also angry with the resort even though the guests brought the food for themselves to eat and there was a gas grill available for cooking.   B. After the storm, a few guests took a tour to a nearby lake and saw a couple on a boat fishing.  The guests noticed how much more successful they were at finding fish.  The guests were intrigued and they went to the other side of the lake to a different spot that seemed more promising and hoped to find fish to eat.  The guests rented a small boat too and started searching.  The guests knew that fish would not be found in shallow water so they started in the deep middle of the lake.  For an hour they tried using three different types of bait with no success.  They went to the side of the water to rest for a bit and saw one of the guests walk by carrying a fish.  This is exciting news.  When the guests asked where he got the fish, he gave them a fishing rod that he did not want to take along with the rest of his stuff.

Can you please tell me?\nOutput: Please see below.\n\nThe short answer is that you need to be able to be able to bike continuously for four hours, and run continuously for four hours (each with adequate cool down prior to moving on) in order to complete a full Ironman. In Ironman training, you should aim for about 16 hours a week of fitness activity.\n\nNote that we haven't even mentioned the swim, which is included, too. For an Ironman, a person should swim enough to not dread the swim part, should be able to swim comfortably across a large body of water (in an event, say 1.5 miles).\n\nIn addition to fitness activity, I would recommend the following.\nFind a coach who has been there, done that. An Ironman is *not* a casual affair, and even the best athletes need help to train well and to successfully compete, both physically, and mentally.\n\nHave the attitude: I am going to have fun. Ironman races are not marathons. They are endurance events. It's ok to not feel your best out on the course. It's ok not to feel that awesome for all four hours while biking. So long as you can handle the course without putting yourself at risk of harm, and you finish safely, you're a success.\n\nInput: I want to know how to calculate the size for one single page of text in A4 paper.

One would be the text which currently doesn't fit on the page, the other the text to be added.\n\nI would have the first text in an instance variable, the second in a list variable.\n\nI would store a running total of how much the text is taking up the page.\nI would store the last index (integer) where there is space that I need to use with a variable (last_available_index or something similar).

Since the bus is electric the cost that of transportation won\u2019t increase and more importantly there is no gas used. With less gas in the air there is less carbon dioxide added to the environment and when we breathe less gas and less carbon dioxide we get cleaner air. With the cleaner air that will be better for all the students and staff on the campus. There is no harmful chemicals added to our air anymore and now the air is cleaner. The buses won\u2019t need to run as much and less gas will be used in the whole campus for all the buses, they may even be able to get rid of the diesel bus and that is also better for the environment. Since there is a lot better air and less gas being used to get around the campus the ozone will be better also.\n\n\n<br>\n\n<div style=\"align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.pythonprogramming.net\" target=\"_blank\" >", "answer": "D: office supply store"}

{"idx": 967, "text": "C: offended\n\n\n##### Answer\nThe first part, we need to convert the kilograms of weight(kg) to kilograms per pound(kg/lb)(since the question is asking for dollars and cents; 1 kg is $12, so 1 kg/lb is $12/lb). This means 3 kg is $12 x 3 = $36, and 2.5 kg is $25 x 2.5 = $62.5. Therefore, the price is $36 + $62.5 = $94.5.\n\n\nThe second part is asking for a percentage amount of time he spent at the gym each week. This means he spent the same amount of time everyday; with a little of warming up and cardio, he spent 23/36 hours everyday at the gym, totaling to 23 hours per week. \n\nThe second part asks about the fuel he spent on his plane. He spent 120% more by spending $200 + 22% = $264 more. Therefore, he spent $480.\n\nPart three asks about the number of goals scored in one season. We use this equation, goals scored by 2 players / Total goals scored in the league = X. Now if X is equal to 20%, that means the two players scored half of all the goals, or 15% of the goals scored in the league because 50 * 20 = 15%. If they both had equal numbers of goals, the number of goals each player scored is 15% of 300, which is 45.\n\nThe next part states how many ounces of liquid he drinks in a whole week. He has 5 12 oz cans of soda a day, which is a total of 60 ounces. He also got 64 ounce of water a day, which is 464 total for the whole week. In addition, we want the answer to be in terms of cups, not ounces. Since we know 8 fluid ounces = 1 cup, we first convert the ounces to cups. The equation would be hours, cups of soda, and cups of water. Because", "answer": "A: special"}

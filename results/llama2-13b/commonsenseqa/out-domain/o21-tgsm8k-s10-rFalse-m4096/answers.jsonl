Find the largest 4-number sum\n\n[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-sum-4/description/)\n\nThe problem can be solved by using brute force, but if we analyze the problem a bit, it can be solved using two stacks efficiently.\nThe approach is as follows:\n1. Keep inserting numbers into a stack until a 4-number sum is found. Whenever you see a larger 4-number sum in the second stack, the new sum is smaller and so it is pushed backwards in the stack.\n2. Once you hit the end of your second stack, pop the number from your first stack. If the number is a possible sum, then it is pushed into the fourth sum stack.\n3. After that, iterate over the first stack again.\n\nLet's see how our approach works:\nFirst, take the input numbers and push into the second stack where you can compare.  Your second stack will always be the largest sum if you keep popping numbers from the first stack one by one. In this case, 1+2+3+4=10\n\nWe have seen that the second stack was equal to 10 for number 4.\n\nLet' s take the number 5. While comparing from 4 to 5, you will notice that 4+5 will make 9 and 1+2+1+5 will also result in 9.\n\n15 will be popped and pushed to stack 3 on top of stack 2, but the 8 will be popped and compared as 4+4. This will eventually make 12 if 4+8 is chosen and that would make stack 2 smaller than stack 3.\nSince the 12 is selected and popped from stack 3 because it is smaller, stack 3 will now look like this:\n\n8: 12: 13: 15\nAfter that, we compare 5 with stack 2, but both 5 and 2 result in 7, so nothing is popped, and we", "answer": "B: classroom"}

I was really disappointed because I was hoping this was going to start off the project. Nonetheless I decided use good old trial and error. I created a dictionary and entered each option as keys and put `True` into them as their corresponding values. Then I put the function of user input into the dictionary and got the corresponding keys and values that correspond to one another. After that I could check if the answers were in the same order as user's input. If they were, then I printed the correct option. If you have an answer in mind, it would be best to use that method and if, you can use a different way to arrive to the same answer.\n\n```\ndef answer_multiple_choice_1():\n    input = int(input(\"Enter your answer: \"))\n    if input == 56:\n        print(\"This is the correct answer.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Please check your answer.\")\n    if input == -4:\n        print(\"Wrong.

Since the plane could store twice as much fuel as before. The correct answer is D.\n\nThe statement said that 20% of 300 is the number of goals scored by two players in one season. In other words, the total number of goals is 6 times of 20% of the goals scored, 6 times of 30 is 180. The number of goals scored by those players is 180/20, which is 5400/20 or 270.\n\nThe statement says that he needs to drink 864 ounces a week. He drinks 5 cans of soda and one bottle of water. 864/12 is about 72. So, he drinks one bottle every 12/7 of a day. 72/12/7 is 1. The statement says that he drinks 64 ounce a day, so he drinks a bottle every day.\n\nThe question says that 2 players are filling up a trunk with an initial 6000 block. Everybody works for 4 hours, and it takes 250 blocks of their work each hour. And, the work rate is the same for every worker. The total capacity filled up during the four hours work is equal to the capacity of the container, 6000. When a worker takes 250 per hour and works for 4 hours. He/She will work for 4 hours 4*250 is 1000 blocks. So, during the 4 hours work, they collectively fill up 6000/1000 blocks which is 6 blocks. The 6 blocks are for 4 hours, so in 1 hour the workers supply 6/4 or 1.5 blocks to the container. And in 60 hours, the workers fill up the capacity of the container. So, to the final 15 blocks should be supplied, but as the workers are working at the same time, the", "answer": "C: deny"}

It is estimated by some researchers that for every dollar's worth of productivity that is gained, there is 1 dollar's worth lost from a society that is torn asunder by divorce. Many families suffer devastating trauma such as depression or psychological trauma which costs them dearly.

{"idx": 743, "text": "B\nAnswer explanation\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: To understand the word 'trunk', we need to know the first word in the sentence, which is 'Where'. The word 'Where' refers to the part of clothes that are old. The word 'Trunk' refers to the suitcase. 'Where' and 'Trunk' do not belong in the same place. 'Trunk' belongs in an area similar to that of a suitcase (because they are both used to store things), rather than an area in which old clothes are stored.\nThe word 'drawer' does not belong to the same place where 'old clothes' can be stored because 'drawer' can be used to refer to the shelves on the dresser.\nThe word'suitcase' is used in place of the trunk. This is because the word'suitcase' refers to a small version of a trunk. Suitcases can also be used to store clothes, but not at the same pace as trunks.\nThe word 'book shelf' does not refer to the same category as 'old clothes'. A bookshelf can be used for paper documents, paper folders and files, but not for clothes. You can store clothes in the form of a shelf but not books. \nThe word 'washing machine' does not belong to where old clothes are stored because the old clothes can be stored in clothes containers. It would be better to have them in the form of a machine and not in the form of a container.\nTry the above questions. Give yourself a chance to solve the questions and find out what's wrong with the question, but don't Google the answers until you can understand and explain your reasoning behind the answers.", "answer": "A: trunk"}

There is no way\n\nComment: Don't do this.  The whole point of dictionaries is that you map a value to a key.  A mapping in Python is a tuple (key, value).  If you have a dictionary containing values you want to be their keys, just make it a tuple dictionary.  (https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items)\n\nComment: Do you understand how to convert a dict into a set?\n\nAnswer: Dictionary keys must be hashable.\n\nIn Python 3, `d = {(k, v): v for k in keys for v in values}` can be used.\n\nIn Python2, [`collections.OrderedDict()`](http://docs.python.Org/library/collections.html#collection_orderdict) can be used. This can also be done with `dict.items()` and a tuple object:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndict([(\"\".join(k), v) for k in keys for  v in values])\n\\end{code}.\n\n`orderdict` is the same as dict, but ordered. It can be used as a drop-in replacement, in the same way as ordinary dict.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe constructor for `OrderedDict` also accepts a `key` argument, which is an arbitrary Python object (e.g. a string, or an instance of a class that provides a `__hash__()` method or an `__cmp__()` to compare against the key); this key argument is compared instead of the key objects in the iterable. In this mode, the orderdict has no guarantee of keeping the original order of the iterable: the elements are simply mapped to values according the given key argument.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: Thank you, this was so helpful", "answer": "A: michigan"}

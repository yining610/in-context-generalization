Choices:  A: stress B: debate C: argument D: winning or losing E: tension<n>Output:		Tension<n><n>***<n><n>### Solution<n><n>* 1. Mary had 89 and 3 large stickers so the remaining 89-large stickers should have 86 left. In order to get the total stickers left, we need to multiply 86x7, so we get 179x7= 1073<n>* 2. Zach can make 15 dollars with his allowance and extra money so he would need 100+15=115 dollars.<n>* 3. First we need to find out how many legs the kangaroos can have. 23/2=11.5 so it can be 11 legs. Next, 23 kangaroo legs are not enough, so you need to buy 9 more kangaroos. 9*11=99. And for the goats, you need to buy 123 goats because you have 3 times as many goats. Next, the total amount of legs is 99+123=222.<n>* 4. Since the 4 cookies cost $5, so if we have 4 cookies, each of them costs $1.20. Then, since he only saved 20 dollars, he doesn't have that much money left. Therefore, he would have $20-4$1.25=3$1.20=$3<n>* 5. First, we need to figure out what each player needs to get an average of 287 points per game. The avg is 287, so each player needs that average. The total number of games are 10, so each person would need 2870/10=287 points per person per game. We know each player has 4 points so 4 times that is 287 points.<n>* 6. First, we need the amount of time spent on the each homework subject. It is 20 minutes for the biology homework, and 40 minutes for the history homework. Next, the amount of time he spent on the homework for those two subjects is twice as much as the time he spent on the history homework. So we need to add the times together twice. 20+40=60. So the

Choices:  A: arrogate B: retain C: embrace D: smile E: engage<n>Output:		A<n><n>Input:(The following is in the text provided for this question)<n><n>```<n>(A) Arise Away is an example of a verb followed by a verb-like phrase.<n>a verb-like phrase is a prepositional phrase containing the verb be or<n>an auxiliary verb that has no lexical use apart from its use as an<n>auxiliary. The verb be and the auxiliary verb have a few uses that are<n>not concerned with the predicate part of the sentence or with the<n>complement.<n>The first use of these verbs is as a complement when it follows a modal verb<n>to give the mood, as in be sure.<n>The second use is as an intensifier, that intensifies a verb when<n>placed at the beginning of the clause after adverbs such as<n>definitely, absolutely, or literally, as in “absolutely<n>terrorized,” literally<n>“brutally gutted,” “definitely gone,” “he didn’t just<n>win; he took all the marbles,” and “they’re not just<n>dating; they’re engaged.” This use may appear odd but<n>grammatically it is regular. Note too that to follow the verb be,<n>an adjective needs to appear immediately after be in order to<n>complete the predicate phrase, as in “too little to be<n>effective.”<n>Thirdly, the verb be and the auxiliaries have may be used to indicate that<n>something has or has not changed or has taken place over time.<n>This use can be considered an aspect of sentence combining. Examples<n>of this are “things have changed” and “every word was used a<n>future,” “has become,” etc. When be appears after have or have<n>appeared, it always takes the present perfect form to be, have, has, or<n>has appeared. An auxiliary verb takes the plain form to be, has, have, or has<n>appeared.<n>There may be other uses of those verbs, which are not concerned with the<n>predicate. When they are used that way, they may be called verbless verbs. Such phrases are<n>uncommon. One example is the imperative form of the sentence when we say “Go.”<n>When no verb appears, then a subject is needed after the subject pronoun has in an infinitive<n>phrase. Another use of verbless verbs

A. 1 B. 1 C. 2 D. 304 <n>Output:  **E** - Choice D is correct answer and the rest are wrong<n><n>Explanation:<n>The room has a lock with two keys. Each key is a two-sided piece of rectangular chocolate chip cookie. You have one such piece with you.<n><n>Since you have just one key, you cannot open the door.<n>You now need to make a copy of your only key piece for getting in the room.<n><n>Consider two-dimensional space and let (x, y) be the coordinates of any cell. Initial position of the piece can be any (x, y) except (1, 0).<n><n>You can flip it only if it is in cell (1, n), where n > 0. In cell (0, n), flipping is illegal.<n><n>In order to get in, you need to have the piece in (0, 0).<n>Let the number of steps for getting it to (0, 0) be L.<n><n>So L is the number of flips required.<n><n>If we consider (x, y) as binary digits of x and y, the problem can be represented using binary numbers.<n><n>For the given problem, the length of the required binary sequence is L = 304. Hence, B(x^3) is the solution of the problem (x^3 means “x raised to the 3rd power”).<n><n><n><n># Solution<n># For explanation of each step used in solution see the comments.<n><n>def solution():<n>    L = 303 # Length of the required binary sequence<n>    return " " * int(format(L, "0*" + str(L).count("1") + "b"))<n><n>def bin(val: int): return "".join(format(int(i), "0" + str(L).rsplit(".")[0] + "b"))<n>    # val is either '1' or '0'<n>    # "0" + str(.rsplit) is only to ensure that length of ".rsplit" doesn't effect length of this expression.<n>

I don't see any place where it gives the solution.<n><n>Comment: Is this an exercise?<n><n>Comment: Yes,  it is. They did not give us any explanation of  why their solution  is correct.<n><n>Comment: In your case it's 2.3 times 23 + 4 legs of kangaroos. 1+2+3+...+12 +(2*13+(3*14))...+(4*23). This is a well known result (in fact, it's called Catalan number), and it has  several proofs.<n><n>Answer: I think on the third one you are supposed to find the total number of legs and then divide by 2 (kangaroos have 4 legs, and the same goes for the goats) and multiply by 3 (3 times as many goats) you should get 660 legs.<n><n>Comment: Yes that makes sense. But we are told about goats and kangaroos. The total number of legs I think should equal to the total amount of legs minus those from the goats.<n><n>Comment: My best guess would be that in the first line, you are supposed to take into account the fact that both kangaroos and the goats have legs, but in the total amount of legs you just don't care about the legs of the goats.

It supports random access.<n><n>#### Question: What is meant by the term "random access"?<n><n>##### Answer "Random access" in context of arrays means that the elements can be accessed at random positions.<n><n>#### Questions: Are the elements of an array stored in a contiguous block of memory? Explain.<n><n>##### Answer No. As elements are not stored in a continuous array and this creates holes in the array.<n><n>#### Question What is a null pointer?<n><n>##### Answers <n><n> * A null pointer is a pointer that points to nothing.<n> * It is a pointer that points at a memory location for which the content is not set up.<n> * A null pointer points to a location where the content of the addressable memory section is not set up. That is any address can be assigned to a Null Pointer (e.g. 0, 200, 5 etc.); the result is invariably the same—it will be a null pointer.<n> * A null dereferencing is equivalent to a division by zero. Therefore, a null reference is an exceptional mistake because it typically is produced when a variable is utilized in a path that is not really a pointer.<n> * One must remember that the pointer must be assigned to a null value.<n><n>#### Question <n><n>Given the following code: <n><n>`int *p;<n>p = new int[10];`<n><n>Which of the following can be inferred about this code?<n><n>    1.

How many kilograms of water the man has absorbed?<n>Output: 74<n><n>### Hints:Looking for hints?<n>Hint #1: Think about all the different ways you could put the stickers on.  When Mary puts stickers on the journal, she is no longer able to put the sticker on the next page.  To find the number of stickers left over, we can subtract how many stickers she has on from 89 stickers she started with.  This number is exactly the number of stickers she has right now.<n><n>Hint #2: Zach can buy the bike after earn$100.  At the beginning of the week, he has $65 in his pocket, so let us solve x + 65 = 100.  After he gets 10 dollars from his parent, the equation becomes x + 65 + 10 = 100, the solution is x = 75.  After the week ends, he earns $ 7*2 = 14.  If he pays his neighbor $10 on Saturday, his pocket only has 65 – 24 = 41 in the pocket.  Then the equation becomes x +41 – 24 =100, whose solution is x = 117.  If Zach starts from x = 65 and earns 20 dollars in one week, he can buy the bi.<n><n>Hint #3: Mark has 23 kangooros and three times the goats.  Goats have four legs and kangaroos have two.  The goats’ legs is 3 * 23 + 4 * 2 = 82 goats’ legs.  The kangaroos’ legs is 2 * 23 = 46.  Thus total legs is 82 + 46 = 128.<n><n>Hint #4: Josh has 2

For equations we can solve them and give a reason for why we choose<n>the given answer choice.<n><n>c. If it is a word problem we can describe what it is  about and  identify<n>who, what, when, where and if possible, how much. If there are  variables <n>in  the  word problem,  we need to  identify and find the  value of those<n>variables.<n>d. For questions that are about percentages and interest, we can write an<n>equation and solve it.<n><n>**Note:**  If a  problem  in the test   is hard to  handle  we  should<n>eliminate some of  the answer choices to  make it  easier.<n><n><n>**Example:**<n><n>1.  For the question where would you find a candle on a birthday cake, we use the following:<n><n>**Rule 1:**<n><n>We know that candles are placed on birthday cakes, so as we identify the  word  'candle',  it must mean a birthday  cake  question.<n><n>**Rule 2:**<n><n>For the question where, we know that the answer can only be A or D only, this  because we know that the candle is an object, so it can exist  somewhere in  'where'. So,  A and D  are the  correct answer choices.<n><n>**Rule  3:**<n><n>The  following  are  the  answer  choices  : <n><n>A. dimly lit room<n><n>B. kitchen<n><n>C. wall<n><n>D. table<n><n>E. birthday cake<n><n>**Rule 4:**<n><n>We  can  solve  the equation of  answer  choices and  see  what has  the  most fit answer.<n><n>**SOLUTION:**<n><n>A dimly  lit  room cannot  be the  answer as  candles are used  in  lighted  areas  only.<n><n>B.

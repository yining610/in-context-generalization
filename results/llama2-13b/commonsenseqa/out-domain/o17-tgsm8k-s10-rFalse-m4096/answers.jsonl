Second b. Minutes c. months d. Hour e. Year\nOutput: C\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: When you use `*` it means you should multiply. That can be understood in math, but not in Python so don't be alarmed.\n\nSo in this example:\n\n\\begin{code}\n\"I have 2 baskets and there are 6 apples in them.\"\n\\end{code}}\n\n`2 * 6` is equal to `12` since a basket has 6 apples which are multiplied by two baskets.\n\nFor your code you need to rewrite it to this:\n\n`2 * (\"There are 10 apples\") * (\"There are 20 bananas\")`\n\nSince the amount of apples is twice as many, multiply them. Since the amount of bananas is twice as many, add them.\n\nHowever it will be very helpful to learn Python since it's not only the same as math, but there are a lot of small things that could differ from math such as this.\n\nComment: @AkshatShukla I hope I", "answer": "B: insignificant"}

They remain\nirreducible. So 139 will remain 139, and 51 will remain 51, while\n9 is a prime number and can always be written as 3x3.\n\nThere is a sequence of prime numbers that starts with 3. The\npattern is one, two, three, five, seven (and so on). So the\nfirst few primes are 3, 5, 7 (and so on).\n\nWe could see which of the primes divide evenly by four and work\nfrom there, eliminating them from this sequence. That would be\n3, 7 (and that is all).\n\nSince 4 divides both 3 and 7, we can eliminate 4, 8, 12, 16 (and\nso on) from consideration.\n\nSince 3 divides both 5 and 7, those too can be eliminated.\n\nSo the only remaining prime, 9, would be the third number in the\nsequence.\n\nOutput: 9\n\nInput:What was the name of the ship that set sail on 12 July 2018 that\nwas named as a tribute for a deceased member of our family, was\nsailed by a relative of ours, and made its first voyage from Portsmouth\nHarbour, the Royal Navy's home?\nOutput: HMS Queen Elizabeth\n\nInput:If you travel by plane from Bristol to Newcastle and then catch\na train from Newcastle to Hexham, how long does it take you\nto get to Hexham?\nOutput: 05:48:32", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

{"idx": 622, "text": "C\n\n[Source](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/584382/Instruction-Answer-the-following-multiple-choice-question.)\n\nThis question was designed to test the candidate's understanding of basic arithmetic and quantitative analysis. Given that most professionals may not be exposed to or tested on this topic in their careers, it is a good addition to any interview process. With our experience of working with a wide range of professionals in various roles, we have found that there are individuals who lack fundamental mathematical knowledge, which can be an indicator of an overall lack of academic and analytical rigor. These skills are essential for success in many roles, and it is crucial for an employer to be able to identify candidates who have a strong foundation in these areas.\n\nThe key to answering this question lies in having strong arithmetic skills, which involve being able to quickly and accurately perform arithmetic operations. For example, if the question asks for the total value of a group of items, it is important to be able to add up the values of each item and quickly arrive at the correct answer. Similarly, if the question involves discounts or percentages, it is crucial to be able to quickly calculate the correct amount using basic mathematical operations.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is the ability to think critically and logically. This involves breaking down the question into smaller parts and approaching it using a systematic and efficient solution. For example, if asked to calculate the amount of a purchase, it is important to start by calculating the cost of each item and then adding them up to arrive at the total cost.\n\nFinally, it is essential to pay attention to detail and read carefully to ensure that the answer is correct. It is easy to make simple mistakes when working with numbers, but it is crucial to catch any errors to ensure that the final answer is accurate.", "answer": "B: passing grade"}

{"idx": 975, "text": "architect\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question based on the following passage.\nThe best-known example of an airy castle is the Taj Mahal, a mausoleum built by a Moghul emperor outside Agra, India. It was built around 1647 at a cost which today would run into the billions of dollars. Its dome is not supported by pillars, but floats 200ft up in the air. This building is said to be impossible because at the time there had been no known precedents anywhere in the world for a structure of such vast proportions having no supporting pillars, yet the Taj Mahal's dome floats lightly in the air for over 200 feet. The Taj Mahal' is an imposing monument. Some people say that its dome is impossible as the dome is not supported from below and it has a huge weight. \n\nIn India there are many domes of 150 to 200 feet tall and they don't have any support from below. This example shows that it is possible to build such a dome without supporting pillars below. There are many other examples which also show that domes can be built without pillars below. \n\nSuch domes have a special structure of stones and they are called \u201cvault domes.\u201d All vault domes have the same structure. The base of the dome has a square shape. It becomes like an octagonal form and like an 16-sided form when it is a bit higher from the ground. The top of the dome is also like a cross structure. These structures of stones are strong enough to support such a huge weight.  As the Taj Mahal is in India, the domes in India are built in a similar manner. The Taj dome is also one of these types of domes which have a similar base shape and a similar cross structure at the top of the dome.\n\nThe Taj Mahal was built by a rich emperor at a time when there was no technology like steel or cement. But many great stone structures at that time stood the test of time. This means that our technology is not always necessary to build strong structures with. \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput:'The Taj dome's base has", "answer": "C: architect"}

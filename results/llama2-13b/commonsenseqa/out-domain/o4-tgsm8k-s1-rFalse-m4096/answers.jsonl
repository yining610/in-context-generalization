If you are trying to do more advanced tasks (like programming), what tools or strategies do you use?\n\n2. If you have a bad connection, how can you improve it? What are some free apps you use to maintain a connection or do work online?\n### Answer:\n\n1. I have to use older computer because I don\u2019t have much money and I need to take care to make it work longer. I often download many programs to clean my computer.  I tried to download disk cleanup, which is an app for windows. Sometimes it works but sometimes it\u2019s not useful to make computer run faster.  However, I just take care to the old computer by cleaning up the unnecessary files and take good care of this old computer.\nIn terms of programming task, I often get frustrated about my program whenever it\u2019s not working well. So, the most valuable tip for me is to try to find the bug of the program. I always focus on one problem and go back to find the source of that problem rather than giving up on my problem.\n\n2. If my internet connection is good, I just stay away from the router and keep it on the same side of the wireless device. I found it is good way to keep the signal strong.\nFor free app, I usually use chrome because it has many useful programs in one app such as youtube, google docs, and google hangouts. Also, the other benefit is that it can sync automatically whenever you have two devices such as phone and pc.\n\nIn order to use the internet, I don\u2019t really use any app. I\u2019m not really into using apps. However, if I have any important work or data, I save it on a usb stick or memory card.\n\n## Questions for the Hackathon:\n* How do you solve a problem as computer science students?(or what strategies do you use for doing the CS?)\n\n**Answers:**\n\nThe most efficient way of solving the problem is, to focus on one problem at a time, break the problem down into small problems and try to find the solution to the small problems.\n\n#### Q2.\n\n* How do you decide which tools to use?\n\n**Answer", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

One of the limitations of using a stack (LIFO) is that it doesn\u2019t allow us to access the items that we\u2019ve pushed into the stack from the back. We are only able to access the items that were pushed most recently to the stack.\n\nWe can combine a stack and a queue into a new data structure called a push-down stack. It stores each item in a separate node. This is represented by the two numbers that are stored in each node of the push-down stack.\n\nWe store the top two elements of the stack at the top of the stack.\nWe store the top element and the next element that is queued into the stack as a separate node below the two elements of the top of the stack.<br>\nThe figure above shows how this push-down stack is organized. We call the number stored from the top of the stack as the peek element and the number to be queued into the stack is called the push element.\n\nWe use the peek element from the top of the two elements in the push-down stack as the next element in the queue. We do the same for the push element.", "answer": "C: grassy field"}

This section demonstrates how to call a function with an int parameter.  The second integer is passed as 16.\nThe first integer passed to get_integer is called the left operand and the second is called the right operand.  These are given the same names as the operands of a standard mathematical expression.  The + character is the symbol used to signify the plus operation.  The &lt;code&gt; operator precedence table is used as a reference when learning about which operations take precedence over other operations in mathematical expressions.\n###### Explanation:\nWhen calling a function with parameters, remember to include the function\u2019s name.  In some programming languages, it\u2019s necessary to include a parameter name, but not in C. To call a function that calculates the factorial of an integer, the correct method would be factorial(int x), which should return the factorial of the given number.\nAnother important concept that", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

{"idx": 200, "text": "B\nI hope those examples helped you a bit. This question is multiple choice and is looking for you to read a prompt and answer the multiple choice questions. This was super easy to do using spaCy. You have to read the question and separate the sentence, which is easy to do with spaCy.\n\nThe next step is to create the variable and give it a name, let's call the variable question so we can use it later. The next step is to create an empty list which I'll call choices. I'll have the choices as a list which contains other lists. This is where we store our multiple choice options. After you create the variable names choose question and the list of options you're ready to read the sentence and separate it.\n\nTo read the sentence we use sentence.text and I'll store my answer. I should also add that if sentence.text equals null then it's a different question format. If your questions are like the ones that are above then your text is in paragraph form like we learned in our previous section. Here are the sentences we're working on in this particular sample.\n\nFor the first question it's Mary had 89 which I converted to a number. The first sticker is large and it's on the front it's 3 so I'll take that number and add it to the answer, which is 40 in this case. The next part is she used which is a verb and next comes 7 and then the number 10 the number 10 is what she uses because she does other pages. I'll add 70 to 40 which gets me 110 and then 10, so 120. Mary had 89 so 89 and 120 and I'll add them to get the correct answer.\n\nWhen I created the correct answer, if the answer equals 14 then it's correct but if it doesn't then the answer must be incorrect. For this question only one answer can be correct. For the second question there is no verb because it says on Friday, so Friday is a day, it's not a verb. The next word is weekly which is the first verb. It also gives you the amount of money it's weekly 5.

You will be performing this on a single `split()`) and then combining the contents together to form a single string that will be compared alongside with the rest of the text to form a new, greater string.\n\n- In Ex 2,\n    - Using two different numbers (`5/ week` and `10 $`), you'll need to combine the money into a single number and then increment that number to check if it's greater than the final value of your initial goal (`100 $`).\n    - After which you will need to subtract this value from your final goal again to see if it is equal to or greater than your pre-allocated budget (which is stored away in a variable).\n- In Ex 3,\n    - You'll need to combine a few different integers and then see if they are equal, less than or greater than a given value.\n    - We will then combine them to form a string containing the final value (again using `.join()`), which you'll need to compare to the final goal.\n\n- In the last exercise, each individual string (the letters in each of the options) will differ and you will need to determine which option falls within a given letter/s. \n\n\n\n---\n### Instructions: Answer the questions below.\n\nWhat is the string \"Hello\"?\n\nString\n\nWhat is the name of the operator that means subtract?\n\nminus\n\nWhat is the value of the following line of code?\n\nint answer = 10 * 3\n\n30\n\nWhat does the following line of code produce as a print statement?", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

Each jewel's price is represented by a single integer. Some of the jewels are broken and have a price with a negative sign in front of the value. Since you don't want anyone breaking any jewels, a \"broken\" jewel is only worth what its value would actually buy you after accounting for the negative sign. For example, a valuable jewel would be worth -$100 because the owner would receive $-100. An \"average\" jewel is worth 3x the negative value (x=the number of negative signs in front), and a \"cheap\" jewel is -$100*10^9.

{"idx": 364, "text": "A\n```\n\nWe create a function that can find the remainder. \n\n```py\ndef remainder(num, div):\n    return num % div\n```\n\nWe can use the function on several cases. We first start with a scenario that has one of the possible solutions and find what we can.  The next step is to create the case with a missing digit, so we can find whatever is left over if we find the missing digit. \n\nIn the first scenario, we have '7' left with '83' so we can use the remainder function, with only the remaining digits, and a base of 10.  We also know that we have 4 digits to use. \n\n```python\ndef remainder(num1, div):\n    remain = num1 % div\n    return str((remain // 10)) + str((remain % 10))\n```\n```py\nprint( remainder('83', '7') )\n```\nThe above will output '8', which means we need 7 more.  So in total we have 15, since we know that our last digit is '3' we only need to figure out one extra digit.\n\nWith this in mind, we can create a scenario that is just one missing digit and try to solve it.\n\n```py\nprint ( remainder('831', '7') )\n\nprint (remainder('423', '7'))\nprint(remainder('483', '7'))\t\n```\n\noutput: \n\n```\n'4237'\n'4837'\n```\n\t\nThe answer becomes 4237, but we know this because we know that both of our numbers are missing a '9'.  We can now make our program accept both cases. \t\t\n\nWe can now figure out that the remainer has not changed in digits and we can go back to our first statement and try it. \n\n``` py\nprint ( remainder('981', '7')\n\nprint ( remainder('180', '7')\n```\n\t\t\t\noutput: 1807, 9817\n\n```py\n\ndef remainder(num, div):\n    remain1 = num % 10 \n    remain2 = num //", "answer": "B: learn about"}

It turns out some animals evolve quickly and some don't, and these differences, more than genetics, drive which individuals and species coexist happily in the same environment, or end up competing instead.\n**The researchers** ** used computers to model how prey individuals and species diversify across the landscape at different speeds, and how predators then adapt or avoid them.

{"idx": 401, "text": "All of the above\n\n### Solution to each problem:\n\n1. Let\u2019s keep track of all the stickers used with a `total_used` variable, for example if we used `total_used = 3 + 7 = 10`. Then we can find `remaining = 89 - 10 = 79`\n\n2. By looking at how Zach\u2019s allowance will add to his savings, we can add the $10 for mowing the lawn to the weekly allowance for 5 weeks to make $50, for example $5 + ($10 * 5) = $50. Then we can find how many $7 babysitting payments are left by subtracting that sum from the bike price, i.e. $100 - $50 = $50. Finally, with two hours of babysitting on Saturday we can find out that he has $10 more left to save by taking $7 * 2 = $14 and subtracting that from $50: $50 - $14 = $36. So, together Zach needs to save $36 more before buying the bike.\n\n3. Let\u2019s keep a running total of the legs as we add more kangaroos and more goats. Kangaroos have 2 legs per animal. Goats have 4 legs per animal. \n * 23 kangaroo legs = x + 2 * x = 4x\n * 3 times as many goats = 3x\n * 2(4x) = 8x\n * 8x + 4x = 12x\n * 12x\n\n4. After buying a hat for $1 and a pencil at $2, Josh has $18 left. So, when buying four cookies at $1.25 each, that would be 18*1.25 = 22.50 = 23$. But we need to have extra for tax. For example 23 + 19.5% = $28.00\n\n5. A and B are correct\n\n### Python code:\n\nAnswer (1).\n\n```\nprint (\"I have {} sticker remaining\".format(89-", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}

This project is about learning to use Haskell, so you should understand this.  Do you understand the language from these examples?  Do you understand the assignment?\n\nComment: Please try and follow the conventions for formatting code -- indentation levels of 8 spaces is one convention, but a consistent convention is useful to both the question-answerer and the reader of the question.  I've fixed up your questions to provide this consistency.\n\nComment: I've removed the [tag:functional-programming] tag, since it is mis-use since it's misleading.  It doesn't mean you're using functions (every program uses functions - even in C), but it means you're programming in the functional-programming paradigm.  For example, Haskell is a functional language, but other functional languages exists, so does functional programming in these other languages.  I've also removed the [tag:syntactic-sugar] tag since it makes no sense.\n\nComment: Thanks I agree that the questions are still hard, but I think the examples on the wiki should help a lot.  In this section of the wiki: https://github.community/wiki/Data-structures, you will see that a Haskell list is similar to an array.  You can imagine your program using a single list variable to represent the sequence of numbers.  You will also see this list variable is an array, but how you use it is different from array usage in C.  I think once you understand this, some of the questions in the test are much simpler.  Happy coding.\n\nComment: So I\u2019ve added in both versions of the code because if you use that for testing purposes and change your code the test will fail.

To do this we first need to find the amount of stickers Mary has, so then we will be able to find the remaining stickers. To find the amount of sticklers Mary has, we multiply the amount of sticklars she has by the amount of times she placed sticklars each and every page she worked(this means 7 for 6 pages). So, we can find the answer by doing 89*7, which will end up giving us 613 staylars. So, to find the answer we need to take out the three large she placed on one page. So, by taking out these three sticklers, we end up getting the correct answer of 46 stickler. This is why the solution to this problem is A.\n\n### Examples of A:\n### Example 1\n`10*7 = 70`\n`0*3 - 70 = -60`\n\n### Exmaple 2\n`10*8 = 80`\n`3*3 - 80 = -77`\n\n### If there are 6 items in a bag, there are 6 items left in the bag.\n\n### This problem is almost exactly the same as the previous problem except in the previous problem we're finding how many sticklers Mary has, and in this problem we're trying to find how much money Zach needs to earn before he buys the bike", "answer": "E: printer"}

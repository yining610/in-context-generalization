It is the first function in the file.\n\nComment: That's all we have, a single function. Where is the main function that calls your code?

And I can't use a main function for the problem due to my school's curriculum.\n\nComment: Well, as it is, your function won't be run at all -- you can't just have a `void` function and expect that. You need either a command line interface (you can use `scanf()` for that) or a menu (you can use `switch` for that), *or else* a `main()` function.\n\nComment: If you can't choose the language, you probably can't choose the style/syntax either.

You'll be writing some code to solve a series of multiple \n# choice questions.\n# Before you begin, let's take a look at the first example lab:\n\n# Lab 5 - Averages\n\n# In lab 5, you were asked the following question.\n# \"On average, how many games are played in the Stanley Cup playoffs?\"\n# You used Python to create a program that read in a list of 10 integers representing the number of \n# games played per year for the past 6 years, and then computed the average using a built-in function.\n# Finally, you outputted the average number of playoff games held annually into the console.\n\n# In this lab, you will be writing a similar program, but you'll be solving some multiple \n# choice problems this time.\n\n### Note: Please leave the lab 5 code in the code editor.\n\n# In the lab 5 code, we created a userdefined variable with the name QUESTIONS.  This is a list \n# that will hold questions and answer choices for the user.\n# The \"append\" method appended each of the answer choices to the QUESTIONS list.\n# The built in \"append\" method will append (\"add\") a new value onto an array or a list.\n#   append([1, 2, 3], 4)\n#   print(QUESTIONS), should look something like this:\n#   ['On average, how many playoff games are played at each Stanley Cup Finals 7 game series?', 'a=3', 'b=4', 'c=5', 'd=6']\n\n#   We'll also create a new user defined variable, QUIET for quiet mode to reduce user interaction.\n# QUIET is set to False.  Set QUIET to True if you \n# only want the code to run with no user interaction.\n\n#   You'll probably want more questions than just one, so you'll be\n#   creating another list called TESTS.  \n\n#   It will be filled with an integer and a string.\n#   The integer will be part or whole of the question\n#   to display to the user.\n#   The string will be", "answer": "C: deafness"}

The largest number is `a` and the least number is `b`.\n\n`a = SQRT(8 * mean * 5/2)`\n\nIf we use sum, we get:   `a = SQRT((43 * sum) + (5/2 * mean) * (b * (smallest - mean) * (sum - smallest)))`\n\nFurther simplifying that equation:   `a = sqrt8 * sqrtmean = SQRT70`\n\nTherefore, the largest number in the  series is `70`.\n\n### Instructions:Complete the Python program\n\n### Problem:\n\nConsider the problem below.\n\nFor each of the following sentences, is there a word, an abbreviation, or a symbol (including those listed in the dictionary) that matches up?

What is the monthly interest rate on this. Choices:A: 3.67% B: 3.30% C: 8.86% D: 0.04%\nOutput:  D is correct. The monthly interest rate on the loan is 0.04%. We multiply the 4% annual rate by 12 divided by 100. This equals, 0.04.\n\nInput:If a person is able to save 60% of the money they make. How long does it take them to save $5000 at the end of the year, if they start with a 500 dollar savings at the beginning of the year. Choices:A:$2000 in 3 years B:$ 500 in 4 years C: $ 4000 in 15 years D: $ 1000 in 4 months \nOutput: E is correct. It takes the person 4 months to save, $1000, because they are able to save 62% of all their income. We divide $5000 by 4 months. This equals $1250 per months. The person has a 500 savings to begin with. They can start saving now or after the end of the month in which they get paid. Therefore, they will have 6 months to save 1250-500=$750. After 4 months they have saved $1000. Therefore, in 5 months they have saved a $1750 which is half of the $3500 they have earned by the 5th month.\n\nInput: What is the smallest part of a $12 bill.

Summary\nI can successfully run the code without any problems but there are some question in the question set, which I can't answer. Since I feel I have the fundamental concepts down, I can answer most of the question set (around 80% of the questions), however, there are still some questions that I can't answer because of some of the details that the programmer did not list. The reason why I can successfully run it is because I have the fundamental concepts of the code down.\n\nFor those questions that I don't know how to do, I had to re-write the code for certain questions, since I couldn't figure out what was wrong even after changing the values in the input section. What I am taking away from this week was how important it was to ask questions when doing any assignment, to make sure we have the fundamental concepts down. \n\n## 2.

The link you provided is to Leetcode's website.\n\nComment: I am guessing the Leetcode website?\n\nAnswer: \\section{What can be improved}\n\nWhen implementing a loop, you should consider the number of times it will run. If a variable is calculated, you need either initialize it at the start of the loop, or you may consider storing the variable at the end of the loop (by using the keyword `return`). In Python, the `break` keyword returns `None`. If the variable will not be used after the `break`, there is no point calculating it. But instead of guessing when the loop will finish, if you put `break` inside `continue`, you know that it will finish, and can calculate it directly (and store it in the previous example, or initialize it at the `break`).\n\n\\section{Answer}\n\nUsing these principles, we can optimize the code and answer 7 out of 16 questions.  This leaves us with 9 questions to answer.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport re\n\ndef answer(q):\n    if re.search('[a-z]', q):\n        return q\n\n    elif 'kilogram' in q:\n        nuts, f", "answer": "D: soup"}

{"idx": 873, "text": "6. Option \"C\"\nExplanation: I believe D is the correct choice of this option because based on the context of the question, we're dealing with a long period of time while the person hasn't received any call back regarding the job. The choice \"D\" seems to make more sense than the other choices because stress can happen anytime. If the person is working hard that could happen in a matter of a few days but the person is being stressed not because she wants to but because she is having a hard time in order to receive some call backs for the job.\n\n##### Answer A:\n\nThe author mentioned this: But she hadn't applied for a job in years. And she was frustrated with herself. She hadn't been laid off in years. Just a few years ago she enjoyed her job as a corporate recruiter.\n\n##### No, because this scenario suggests that it wasn't long enough for her to think that way.\n\n##### Because the question mentions about the time that she has been applying for the job, it could mean that it's not something that would happen right away but it was a long process for her. A could also mean that the person is thinking about getting a job in the future.\n\n##### Choice D \"stress\"\nIt wasn't mentioned that the time period of the stress is long which makes option \"A\" (employment) the best answer. \"The choice of \"B\" was also a good answer, however, the author also said that the job was one that she used to enjoy when she was a corporate recruited.

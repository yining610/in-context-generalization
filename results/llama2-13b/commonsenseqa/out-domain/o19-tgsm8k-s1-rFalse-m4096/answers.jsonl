Few people were there so everyone had great time\nOutput: D\nExplanation: A common mistake students make in the sentence above is to use 'few people were at the' instead of 'few people were in the'.

The cards are flipped over one-by-one and played (with the highest number winning the round).\n    2. The 3rd round is played the same way as the first 2 rouds; except that, this round is only played if both players have at least one card in hand.\n    3. After each round, the winner takes away the losers hand.  Each time a game is won, 1 point is awarded to the winner. At the end of game 1, there are 6 cards (2 from each player) unread.  At the end of game the 2nd, there are 7 cards (from the loser) unread. At the end of the 3rd game, there are 6 (3 x 2) cards unread.  Assuming each game is equally likely to occur (1 / 3 chance that each player wins and ties, and no player plays a tie when it would put both their final cards in play), what is the expected number of cards still unread at the end of the 2nd game.\n\nOutput: 2.9\n\n1. Let $N$ be the random number of cards unread at the end (inclusive) of the first 2 games.  $N$ has a binomial distribution $Binomial(4, 6)$ (or equivalently, $Binomial(3, 8)$), and we can use the geometric distribution to obtain $E[N]$. So, what is $E[N]$, i.e. what is the expected number (rounded to the nearest 0", "answer": "A: seaside town"}

The correct number of bots is B = 8.\n1.  The correct sum of dollars spent is D = 5.70\n1.  The number of pencils purchased is 3.80 is right.\n1.  We need to find out how many bots bought the total number of pencils. \n1.  Therefore, 8 bots can buy pencils.  If 0.7 is converted to a decimal, it is 70%. \n1.  If we divide $3.70 by 0.7, we get $5.28.  Since the initial value is less than $5.28, each bot bought one pencil. \n1.  8 bots means 0.7 \u00d7 8 is $5.76.  So, 8 bots bought 8 pencils.

Thanks to @Renato for pointing out the issue. I reported that issue to Google, and it has since been fixed, and your code should work.\n\nBut this is a great opportunity to learn something new. Let's try to refactor this code to be more testable. The following code has been updated slightly for more efficiency based on @Renato's solution.\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar input;\n\ninput = '4.6 4.5 5.9 4.8 4.9 4.7';\nsum = [ 0, 0, 0 ];\n\nfor( i = 0; i < input.length; i++ ) {\n    split = input[i].split(' ');\n    if(split.length!= 2) throw 'Invalid data';\n    sum[0] += parseFloat(split[0]);\n    sum[1] += parseFloat(i+1);\n}\n\noutput = sum[1] / sum[0];\n\\end{code}\n\n\\strong{Testing on JsFiddle:}\n\nWorking [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/96uYB/78/).\n\nWith Test Suite: [Jsfiddle With Tests](http://jsfiddle.com/96uYb/73/).\n\n\\strong{In this testing approach, we first declare the input variable. But instead of putting actual input right away, we put a sample value instead. And instead of outputting the final value directly, instead it goes into an intermediate array `sum`. This makes it much easier to add more input, like in the test we pass the string multiple times:}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item 4.6\n  \\item 5.5\n  \\item 6.5\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSo all that remains is to output the result.\n\nBut how do we know that the result is correct?", "answer": "A: laugh"}

She also told me that it is the only lip gloss she uses because it has a wonderful scent and glides on smoothly. I looked everywhere I could think of to look. I went to ten cosmetic stores but no luck. Then the next day I decided to look in pharmacies. I visited four of them and still no luck. Then on the way home I tried a discount store and guess what? I finally found the lip gloss. It did have a scent but it reminded me of rubber cement. I went home and told my husband all about my experience.

Whisk the sugar and eggs together in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in the vanilla and pinch of sea salt. Set aside to bring to room temperature before baking.2. Melt butter and let cool down to around room temperature. Add sugar to the bowl, and whisk in the butter until combined. It will start to thicken when you add the butter, but should be completely combined once you're finished.3. Preheat and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Using a cookie scoop or a teaspoon (or whatever you are comfortable with), scoop out the dough onto the baking sheet. Make sure the dough doesn't stick to the bottom of the spoon so you'll get a nice shape!4. Bake for 7-10 minutes. 5. After baking, transfer to a cooling rack and let set completely. These cookies are meant to be soft, so you'll need to wait at least 15 minutes for them to set.6. Melt the butter and let cool. The butter needs to be room temperature, but not too cold. If it's too cold it won't melt. Combine the butter and the remaining ingredients except the cookie dough.  7. Dip the bottom of the cookie into the glaze. It's pretty sweet itself, but you can always add more powdered sugar while it's piping hot if you want a sweeter glaze! Enjoy your cookie!  8. Prepare cookie dough in advance and place it in a gallon bag with sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and half a teaspoon baking soda. Squeeze out air and seal", "answer": "A: headache"}

The way you solve most of these questions is probably the same way you do pretty much any other math problem.\n\nWhen you're dealing with percentages, you are basically just dividing the first number (in your case, `6`) by the second number (in your case `300`) and multiplying by 100. This is how they make up a percentage.\n\nFor example, 6/300 = 0.02, times 100 = 2%. So", "answer": "B: home"}

How many jobs does each assistant complete?\nOutput : 3\n\n\n# Hackerrank\n\n\n[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) provides a platform for programmers at all skill levels to maintain a competitive assessment by developing programming skills in a fun and engaging manner.\n\n# My Experience\n\nHackerrank was extremely fun to try out! For those looking for a challenge, it is perfect! I enjoy the \"puzzle\" aspect of coding and it provided more of a gaming experience than anything. It is a great tool for someone who is looking for a more hands-on style of learning.\n\n\n### Coding Questions\n- [Basic Math (Beginner-level)](hackerrank/Basic-Math.Rmd)[hackerrank/Basic Math.ipynb]: A calculator is a classic code warm-up. In this example, we make a program that tells the user how many pumpkins you have when N people each bring P pumpkins for carving.\n\n- [Currency Converter (Beginner-level )](hackerrank/Currency Converter.Rmd)[hackeank/Currency Converter]: In this example, we create a program that returns the number of USD when there are a specified number of pounds. There is also an additional challenge to create a function to make the same conversion when more than one currency is needed.  \n\n\n- [Chess-board (Medium-level)](hackerank/Chess-board.ipynb): How would you code a chessboard with two different player color? This question challenges a person to use multiple loops to solve this puzzle.\n\n- [Daily Interview Challenge](hackerrank/Daily Interview Challenge.ipynb): The Daily Interview Challenge is a series of simple coding challenges that one must complete within five minutes.", "answer": "E: warehouse"}

The only thing that the rule implies is that an \"A\" is ripe and a \"B\" is NOT ripe. In order to get to \"C\", we would have to go through \"A\", \"B\", and then possibly \"A\" again. Since \"C\" is at the end of the set as the highest level of the ripeness index, it is impossible for an apple to ever have a \"C\" rating without having a lower rating (i.e., \"A\" or \"B\") first. In other words, an apple cannot start from \"C\". And if an apple does not start from \"A\" or \"C\", it cannot be ripe.\n\nInput: Tanya has received 10 identical gifts in a box, wrapped in pairs", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}

How many games would Lexer have to play if the first player was randomly chosen from a list of 12 players, the second player from a different list of 8 players, and so on.\nOutput: The players in the first list are chosen from a list of players with cardinality 12. Therefore, there are 12 ways to choose them, and you can play with them in 2131 different ways, i.e. without the duplicate combinations of first player with each of the second players, resulting in 12 * 2131 games. Similarly, each time you choose the second player from a set of 8 players, you have 8 ways to choose them. Since these combinations are not included in the first 12 * 8 * 2132 games, you can play with them 32 ways. Since 12*8*2132 = 32 * 12*2132, this is the final answer.\n\nInput:Cameron likes to wear a skirt, a jumper, and a shirt together.

Each lamp can be fit on a shelf. There are 88 lamps and 10 shelves in that room. There are many rooms like that in that building. You will be the manager of this room who has to arrange the lamps on to the shelves. Since you have no information of how many lamps can fit into a single shelf, the best choice is to assume that each shelf contains 4 lamps. If that is the case, then you know that there are 11 lamps on 5 shelves, so 2 lamps would be left out. When you calculate those lamps, you must also consider the lamps on the shelf that you are not using and all the other shelves that you have no lamps on. You can get any answer you want, as you can choose any shelf to put any number of lamps. For example, if you put 1 lamp into a shelf, then you have to put 4 lamps into every other shelf in that row and 2 lamps in the last shelf because you have two choices to put one or two lamps there. Then you just keep doing it until the last two lamps. One of the two shelves may contain extra lamps if you fill the others in correctly.

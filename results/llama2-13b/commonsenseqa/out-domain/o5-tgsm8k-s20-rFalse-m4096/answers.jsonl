Words rhyme if any pair of them differ in first and last sound and have either the same vowel interspersed with consonants or have a consonant followed by a vowel sound. (Example: house, mouse, horse). A word will only be accepted if it rhymes.\nOutput: Yes\n\nInput:Given a string of words, count the number of unrepeated words in it. Words are said to be repeated if they have identical or similar meanings (for example, \"fly\" and \"flying\"); otherwise, they are completely different. For example, \"fly\", \"flying\", \"flyer\", \"fly away\", \"flew\", \"flying\", and \"few\" should be counted as six unique words.\nOutput: 7\n\nInput:Givem text from one or more files and count the number of times that one word from a dictionary appears in it.\nThe number of occurrences of a word should therefore be no greater than the number of lines in the given text. Words that appear in the text but whose meanings are completely different or are homonyms are treated as unrepeated words.\nOutput: Yes \n\nInput:Consider whether 2 strings can be mapped to each other.\nNote that a mapping of 2 strings is said to be valid if the first string can be transformed into the second through a process that changes only certain characters. For example, the strings \"dog\" and \"dig\" cannot be mapped to each other since the mapping does not preserve the length of the given string. However, the strings \"dog\", \"dig\" and \"dogged\" are said to be mapped to each other through a process that swaps every vowel in the first string with the first letter in \"dig\" (producing \"dug\", \"dgi\" and \"doged\", respectively) and swaps the second character in the first string with \"d\" (this generates \"d\", \"o\", and \"g\", respectively).\nOutput: Yes", "answer": "A: being understood"}

In my case, the answers would display as options rather than answers, which would have been confusing for the user. When I asked my instructors, they recommended asking a question instead, and that I could ask the questions directly, or have a placeholder value and only set it when they wanted one of the question's answer to be their choice.\n\nI used the question method, which is a much more natural way to handle choices. I also used multiple `if` statements to cover different scenarios, something I had avoided because of my lack of experience with that style of statement. The instructor recommended it as being a good way to organize things, so it's a helpful skill to have in my toolbox.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result.

This is shown when we have \"8\" and \"3\" compared with a zero in an equal to comparison.\n\n#### **Q2**\n\nAs an answer, we have to consider the following: \n\n1. The sum of \"80\" and \"031\".\n2. The result of the modulus operation.\n3. The result of a shift operation.\n\nBecause we're not given any information about the order in which these two characters are concatenated, we have to assume that the result will be the same as if we treated \"8\" and \"03\" as separate characters.

Instead, you are going to solve it in very small portions or parts. You will solve the smaller parts one at a time. For each smaller part you solve, write down your answer. In the end, add up the answers from each part you solved to get your final answer. A problem can be divided into parts by using variables, mathematic terms, brackets, or grouping symbols.\n\nLet's solve the math problem:\n\n2 + 5 = 7\n\nHow should you do it?\n\nDo not worry about memorizing the following steps yet.\n\nThe variables first came to my mind are (c, d, h) for Corey, Dad, and Home, respectively. But the instructions do not tell me how many and what type of candy I have. I will create a few more variables to find out the number of candies for each person. The problem is the question, How many candies does each person have? The answer seems to be, how many candies Corey has, Tapanga has, Dad has, and Home has. Therefore, the variables that I choose will be (C, H, D, & C) for Corey, Home, Dad, and Candy, respectively.\n\nThe first thing I must do is to make Tapanga has less candy than Corey. The first equation I must create is an equation that determines how many candies do Corey have. My goal is to make sure that the candy Tapanga has is lesser than the candy that Corey has. How can I tell whether or not candy Tapanga have less candy than Core does? Candy is a plural term. So I can compare the candy Tapang have with the candies.\n\nThe answer is C - H = -D\n\nWhich means the difference between Corey's candy and Tapanga's candy is equal to the amount Dad's candy.\n\nTo make it look clean and organized, put the number 8 in the (D) position by itself.\n\nC - H = 8\n\nThe next equation I must create is to find out how many candies T", "answer": "A: slender"}

Instuction: Answer the following multiple-choice question.The city council of a town banned the wearing of sandals on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (but not other days) in order to preserve the town's cultural heritage (but not the environment or public health). The town's mayor recently signed into law a new ordinance banning all types of footwear on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The town's attorney general warned that the combined effect of these two ordinances would be to prohibit the wearing of sandal any day of the week except Sunday. However, if the town's board of appeals overturned the city hall bans, the mayor and the attorney general would have to reconsider their positions vis-\u00e0-vis the town's cultural and environmental heritage and health regulations.

The program needs to find the amount of candies that each person has, then subtract the amount of candies of the other. Note that candies can be represented using numbers with different values. Each number can be incremented by one each time the program meets that number, and can then be decremented by one when the program meets its value. Note that the program can run infinitely, since two variables are always increasing or decreasing with increasing values, then meeting at 66, the same number of increasing variables. One should start from 0 values for both number of variables. It is a little difficult to write a program for this question with loops from 0 value to 66 value.\n\n### Answer1:\n\n```\n#include<stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\nint A,B;\nA=8;\nB=0;\nprintf(\"Tapanga and Corey together have 66 candes.

Then, we will need to implement a function `score_line()` as described in the readme, which will then take a line from this corpus and compute its `score`, where a `higher score` indicates that the instruction is `more likely` to be correct.\n\nThe `score_line()` function computes the `tfidf` (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) score of the question as a measure of relevance. We can implement the `score_line()` and `score_lines()` functions using the `SciPy` as in `Python`.\n\n\n\n\n```py\n\"\"\"\n    Helper function for getting rid of punctuation.\n\"\"\"\ndef remove_punct(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes in a string and returns a version with punctuation removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    string = string.replace(\".\", \" \")\n    return string.lower()\n\n\n\"\"\"\n    Function to compute the Score for a line.\n    \"\"\"\ndef score_line(instruction):\n    \"\"\"\n        Calculate the 'Score' for a given line of text from an instruction.\n    Input:\n        line     : The line from the instruction.\n    Return:\n        Score: The score for the given instruction line.", "answer": "D: socialize"}

Choices: 32 49 24 123\nOutput: 24\nNote: Derek gets points that are calculated in the following manner: Derek gets 20 points for every unique scrabble tile he used. Therefore, he gets 20 points \u00d72 = 40 points for each unique letter in the grid. However, Derek cannot spell the word 'two'. He is not awarded any points for doing so.

He also gets the double point option for every time he uses 'two'. This option is also available upon the end of each turn as is indicated by the 'double points' sign.\n\nInput:How old is Peter?

This can be a tricky process if you are not familiar with the steps. Many of these steps are complex; but, with a careful follow up guide to help you, it will not be as hard as you think. The first thing that you must do is establish how much money you will need for the down payment and monthly payments. That is why your research into your area and specific property you are looking for has to go a long way in providing you answers about the costs of a potential property. After the down payment and month payments have been done, there is still the issue of the cost of improvements and other necessary costs involved with the purchase of a home. These expenses need to be made so that the buyer will have a good quality home to live in that he or she will be happy about. You may also want to consider if an appraisal will be needed before you can sell your property. If you are not sure, some of the costs involved with the purchase and sale of a home may include: Taxes on the home, if you buy in a city with high property tax rates, you may need to get an appraisal or an appraisal done to prove the value of the home. Depending on the property's size and condition, you may need to pay for a professional to inspect the home for you. As a homeowner, you should also ask a lot of questions to determine exactly how much work was done to improve the property and to determine the real value of the home. Aspect of owning a real estate property is that there is a good deal of time that you have to wait for your property to appreciate enough before you can get a return on your investment. One of the problems with this is that with interest rates skyrocketing at an unbearable rate, your house is basically eating itself out of its home. By purchasing the house only one year before the home needs to be upgraded, you can save almost a hundred dollars a month in", "answer": "B: symphony"}

{"idx": 483, "text": "# The number of ways you can split a pie among 5 people\n# is equivalent to 5 ways to split it to an individual.\n#\n# For example: I will give you 4 ways to split a pie among 3 people:\n# 1. a) split the pie evenly. If we split the pie\n# into three equal parts, then the 3rd part becomes a fourth\n# because it has been split already. So, if I have one pie to eat and decide to\n# use 1/3rd, I will inevitably spend most of my time waiting. The same applies\n# to 1 part, 2 parts, etc. For example: if one person wants to eat two thirds\n# of the pie, it takes two times longer because you end up waiting for the whole pie\n# to be served. This is the most straightforward way and can only work for one, not many.\n# So, this is not a good solution for the original question. This is important\n# as we will be using similar arguments later that will make sense at that time.\n# 2. b) Split pie unevenly. If we choose a way to split, say into two, one\n# will have 1/2 of pie and the other person will have 1/4 of a piece. But \n# what if one person wants more? So, by splitting unequally,\n# we are splitting it in a way that is not always possible.\n# 3. c) Order the pie first (or have two more pieces). Then split the \n# pie between two people that share the same preference and split the other\n# pie among the remaining.\n# 4. d) The above example makes you realize that it is better to have equal\n# sized pieces of pie rather than unequal. So, we simply slice the pie\n# into 6 equal pieces and assign one piece to each person. This is the \n# simplest solution to the original question.\n\n# Note that if we were to find the minimum possible number of ways to split\n# an eight-person pie, that would also be 6 because we have 8 people with a single\n# pie. But in this case we do not know the number of people in advance\n# and therefore we must compute the value as we proceed to solve the \n# problem.", "answer": "A: utah"}

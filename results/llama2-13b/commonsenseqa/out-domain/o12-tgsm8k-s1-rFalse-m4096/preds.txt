Then he bought a candy bar<n>and four cookies. If each candy bar costs $0.75, how much money did he<n>have left?<n><n>We can apply one of the following three methods to solve this problem <n>and the answer will be 18.<n><n>1. If we write the given information as a system of linear equations<n><n>Josh’s mom gave him \$20,<n><n>Josh paid \$17, (hence \$17 will be written as $$-17$$)<n><n>Add the two equations<n><n>$ -17 + 14 + 3 + 0.75 + 4*0.75 = 0$ <n><n>$ -10.25 = 0$<n><n>$0 = 0$  (which is the solution)<n><n>2. We draw a pie and Josh will get the pieces of pie. The area of the<n>huge circle is $$ \pi r^2 $$ <n><n>$$ \pi r^2 = 20*0.75 => r = 0.164 $$<n><n>And the area of each small circle is, the area of a circle (that pie<n>were shared among four people) <n><n>$$ (\pi r^2)/4 = 32.5 $$ therefore, <n><n>$$ r = 0.4 $$ <n><n>Josh paid for eight pieces of pie. Therefore, <n><n>$$ \frac{18\times0.4}{20.75} = 18 $$<n><n>3. Let the cost of a candy bar be \$x\$ and Josh bought \$4\times x = 4x\$. Then

For n = 1, I took the next element to be 0 because I had no additional knowledge of the problem (since the first input has not been evaluated for the first guess). Similarly, for n = 3, I took the next input as -2, but this did not work.<n><n>So, I thought about a different approach.<n><n>Suppose, we are able to find that if input is X, then the output is Y.

They can find many useful sites to learn and many interesting contents. They may also be able to learn from YouTube and other sites that help learners to speak without any pressure of being graded. Learners that are visual learners might benefit from videos more because they are able to see people performing things and learners get more ideas on how to speak.<n>* Learning using mind map/outline: Mind map is especially good for memorizing information because you can make up your own way of learning. A mind map can start with one topic, and branch off into different ones. In the middle, you can label topics by writing names in boxes. In the end, you can write a summary, and add a few points again for emphasis.<n>####### Question 2: Why would you want to remember what you are learning, and how can you think critically when you are learning?<n>Answer: When learning you would want to remember what you learn because it will make your learning process easier. You know some examples of remembering is when I’m learning about history in school, or when someone says we need to remember to buy the food at home. So when I learn or when I remember something, it will make my life easier.<n>And, when learning I could think critically about what information is to important for me right now and what is not. Not all information is important, however, it is very important to know what is and what isn’t.<n>#######<n>

At first they were all in the front seat and their were 5 people in the car; they would have been able to fit another 3 people in the backseat.Brianna's mom called the twins and they had a total of 4 carseats in her car, so Aaron's mom picked up the kids and they rode in her car. There were 4 kids and 3 carseats in her mom's car, enough for two of the kids to sit in the backseat and the other two to sit in the front.Then Aaron's mom got in the car with the four of them and they went back home.  If there are 4 kids then it means Aaron and Brianna's kids are twins. So Aaron and Briana are husband and wife. In the original car there were 5 people in it, so in Aaron's mom's car with 4 kids and her there are 5 people in the vehicle.<n>So Aaron's mom must be Aaron's mom. So Aaron must be Brianna's husband. So either Aaron's mom has 3 daughters or 4 sons.<n>Output: 3daughters<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below.<n><n>Input: In what year did Apple introduce it’s first iPhone?<n>Output: 01 January 2007<n><n>Input: What is the first planet in the solar system?<n>Output:  Mercury<n><n>Input: How many degrees is 2π in radians?<n>Output: π<n><n>Input: What's the name of the second largest continent?<n>Output:  Asia<n><n>Input: What year did Apple introduce the first Macbook?<n>Output:  September 2006<n><n>Input: What was

The lesson has three quizzes. The first requires the kids to insert quotation marks in each of the ten sentences that need them. The second has words in all capital letters except the kids have added lower case letters to some of these words. The teacher must now figure out which capital letters should be deleted. The final quiz is a multiple choice test where the teacher is asked to delete the extra periods that have been inserted. In this puzzle, you can treat the sentences as a string of characters. To insert the quotation marks, you must add or remove the letters “’” and make sure they are properly aligned. To correct the other punctuation mistakes, you can remove letters from the individual sentences or add letters before them. Finally, to delete the extra periods, you can replace letters with the letter ‘.‘ and then remove the unnecessary characters. Which of the following is the code snippet you would need to properly insert quotation marks into each sentence? (Choose three answers.)<n>Output: Squares: <n><n>```Python<n>string = "My teacher likes me she likes me not".strip()<n>words = string.split(" ")<n>for i in range(len(words)):<n>    if words[i][0]!= "'" and words[i][-1]!= "'":<n>        words[i] = words[i] + "' "<n>print("\n".join(words))<n>```<n><n>Squares: <n>```Python<n>string1 = "Your childrens' teacher says there is a new rule in school."<n>string2 = "I didn't know that your wife's birthday was her half birthday."<n>print(string1.replace(".", ",").split(","))<n>print(string2.replace("'", "").split("'"))<n>```<n><n>Square: <n><n>```python<n>string = "My family is going to the beach.

After you’ve finished writing the numbers down you have two questions to ask yourself. How much time did Mary spend studying? How many stickers did Mary have left?<n>- This one is definitely more difficult than the first one. The main thing you need to do is figure out what the problem is asking you. The second step is working backwards. If we know that Zach has 65 dollars then we need to work backwards to figure out his remaining balance. Finally you need to calculate the extra number of dollars that Zach will need to get to $100<n>- I want to draw a table (in pen) then answer all the questions with the numbers as given in the question. Then I will subtract all the numbers and I will get 131<n>- We'll consider it as "X"<n>- Firstly we have to calculate the total money that Josh has at hand :<n><n>> "Total money = 22 + 2 + 3.5 * 4 = 33"<n><n>then we can say,<n><n>> "Remaining money = 33 x 4 - 132 = 33 x - 100 = - 67"<n><n>this implies that Josh will have negative money left at the end of the day.<n>- Firstly we'll have to calculate the initial amount of points for each round. Since each team consists of 4 players and each player scores an average of 287 points in a round, the initial amount of points comes to 1156 points. Since there are 10 such rounds, we conclude that the final round will include 10

For now, we will explore solving some through different techniques for problems 1, 3, and 4.<n><n>For the first one we want to think the math behind what is going on and how it can be solved. We first ask how many stickers she had before, which was 89. The stickers were of different sizes, so first we must think how we can represent that in code. We might think about how we can use a variable for the different sizes she had. If we have a variable that holds 3, then when 3 is multiplied by 1, then times 25, what will be the result?<n><n>After thinking about that, then the answer might be that the stickers that she used on the pages with bigger spaces, she used 3 times the number of stickers than the other pages did.<n><n>For the second problem, we want to think how we can model a variable that can store a decimal. To do that, we can use the double data type. Let's think of this number, which is the size of the allowance. We have to save that into a variable, so it can be represented as a variable, but that allowance must also be added to another variable, to let it represent what will be received by  the 2 hours that will come later.<n><n>It is interesting to note that because of how variables work, our variables can also hold other variables inside of it. This functionality will come handier later when we see a different problem.<n><n>### The Output: 6<n><n><n><n>### The Code:<n><n><n>```java<n>import java.util.*;<n><n>public class App {<n>	public static void main(String[] args) {<n>		double allowance = 5;<n>		double allowMore = allowance + 10;<n>		double hours;<n>		double earn = 65;<n>		int legCount; <n>		double legCost = 2;<n>		double cookieCost= 1.25;<n>		final double score

This meant I could use the following formula to determine the answer.<n><n>Number in sequence = a*(1^p)(a<sup>q</sup>)<n><n>The first term in the sequence with p = 5 and q = 5. This meant I found the answer to be: a(1^5)^5 = 2 + 5 * 5^5 = 47, making the answer D, GlRioSuS.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

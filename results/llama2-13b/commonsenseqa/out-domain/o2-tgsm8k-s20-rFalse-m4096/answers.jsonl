{"idx": 119, "text": "pantry\n\nSolutin: There is a lot of guessing going in this question, as there will be in most questions with \"What's your favorite...?\" in them. A good strategy is to list a few possibilities (usually four or five, the maximum in a multiple-choice question), and then to ask yourself whether any seem suspiciously similar. In this case, the three most similar choices are refrigerator, pantry, and grocery store. The others \u2014 kitchen cupboard and pantry \u2014 are unlikely.\n\nA refrigerator and pantry both seem likely storage places, so what's the difference?

The most efficient way to find the answer A would be to read the question, and ignore the details regarding the candy.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt is clear if we ignore the first line, the problem is trivial - we can easily conclude the answer is 29 since the first line has repeated words that we could guess it means \"the answer is\", so I would change it to below to make that more clear and avoid people getting it wrong for accidentally using such words:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nThe answer is A terrifying\n\\end{blockquote}.\n\nHowever, if we keep the first line, then the problem is more nuanced.

The first floor must always be ground level. However, the ground is sloped, so the floor could be in the range 0 to 8, inclusive. In particular, let's say that if the floor is at a depth x, then the actual height of the office building, from the bottom to the top, is actually x + 100 - 4. The depth is the only variable that will go into the floor function. Write a function that will build the floor of the office building on each floor such that you will input a floor number and you will get back an array with all floors that will work for that particular floor. Write code to handle negative numbers.\n\nOutput: The height of the floor should be displayed using the following: floor(x), meaning that the floor of a number must be rounded to the highest integer that is lower than or equal to that number. You are guaranteed that the input will be a number between -54 and 4, inclusive, and you are guaranteed that the first part of the function will work in both Cases 1 and 2.\n```\n\n## Answer:\n\n* After reading the description, it should be clear that multiple values need to be returned in our `function`.\n* Furthermore, we need to compare the user input with a list of values in order to solve this input.\n\n```python \ndef floor(x):\n    if 0 <= x <= 8:\n        return\n```\n\n## Solution:\n\n* After considering above information we should now take the floor", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

Read the instruction and see if the answer can be obtained mathematically. \n**For example,** you can calculate the total number of candies by:\n    1. **Number with Tapanga:** `66 *8/11`\n    2. **Number with Corey:** `66*13/11`\nThe answer turns out to be `33`. And `33-29 = 4 > 0`, which means the answer is `29`.\n\n2. If necessary, create a table.\n    * **Example:**  For the first puzzle, we create a table stating the number of candies:\n        1. **First column:** 73 78 83 88 93 98 103 103\n        2. **Second column:** 70 75 79 84 89 94 99 104\n**Note**: This table is only 8 x 3, because 88-83 = 5 and 88-82 = 6, so we will use the values 79, 84, and 89.\n\n3. **Start counting from Tapanga's side.** And if there is not enough candies to go through Corey's side of the table,\n**skip it and go back to the other side.**\n      1. **Go through the second column and add the numbers you found.**\n4. Subtract the results. \n      2. **If the difference is not the expected solution,\nyou have gone through both sides of the table in the wrong order so go back to the first step.**\n\n**For example for first 83-78 (6) and 94-93 (2), we got 6+2 = 8**. \n\nFor the third puzzle, I made 2 tables: \n    1. **A table for the minutes (time)** The table has 14 columns that are for 14 different locations on", "answer": "A: mail orders"}

The languages are based on a set of rules that define the words you can use in your program. One of the most popular languages is C++, which is widely used by people all around the world to create programs. C++ is very versatile and can be used to create anything from video games and webpages to scientific simulations and mobile devices. C++ is also highly portable, meaning that it can be easily adapted for use on different types of hardware.\nOne of the main reasons why C++ is so popular is its use in computer systems, particularly for programming tasks like operating systems and compilers. C++ has several features that make it especially useful for such systems, including its support for objects and classes, its ability to run on different types of hardware, and its powerful memory management system.

(and so on)\n\nWhich of the following produces the same result as print data\nOutput:0\n\nInput:What is this variable defined as?\n\nx = {print 'cannot print', print(x).}\n\nOutput: 'Cannot print'\n\n### Solution:\n\nTo do this, you just need an understanding of the code that you need to write.\nFor the first question, we have to add 66, which is the total number of candyes they have, together. Now the number of candies Tapanga has is,\n66 + 8 = 74. Now that we know Tapanga has 74 candies, we can find how many Tapanga has left. This is: Tapanga's number of candies - Corey's number. In the problem, Corey has 66 candies. Therefore: 74 - 66 = Corey's number of candyes, and from this, we can determine the correct solution to be: 29.\n\nfor the second question, we first need to add up the total cost of the two calls. First though, we need to find out how much 45 minutes is. This is: (45 *.05 cents). However, the problem stated that international calls are 25 cents. This is: (31 *.25 cents). This then needs to be added together, and therefore: 45*.05 cents + 31 *.2 = 2.25. Therefore, the entire answer is: 5 * 2.25 is 11.25 cents.\n\nFor the third question, you need to understand the answer choices and match them up to the text. In the text, it says they were doing what, and the answer is: work less.\n\nFor the last question, we need to understand how to solve the code to the left. To do this, we understand how the data type of that function works, and then, how we can use it to do something similar to print.\nFirst, we need to determine what the function is set up to do.

{"idx": 547, "text": "E\n\n##### Answer explanation:\n\n* To solve this problem we should know the concept of percentage.\n\n```\nFor Example:\n66 candies in total Tapanga's candies = 78(percentage)\nCorey's candies = (66 - 78) * 100 = 28(percentage) -> 28=29,\nWe obtain the value of Corey's candies.\n------------------------------------\n 66 candies in Tapanga's 78 candies,\nSo, Tapanga's percentage of candies = 73\nAnd percentage of Corey's Candies = 27\nWe obtain the percentage using these equations:\nTapanga's percentage = 78 = (66 * 100)\nCorey' percentage = 27 = (66 -78) = (66 +(78 -78 * 100\nWe can also do this by knowing the percentage system:\nFor 78 Candies --> % = ( 78*100)/80 =100%,\nFor 99 candies --> % = (99*100)/100 =100%,\nSubtract both percentages:\n100% -100%  = 100% - 100% = 0\nSo, If you have more candies than somebody else then you must have 100%.\nNow if your first person's candy percentage is 73% then the other person's candy % would be:\n100*(73/100) = 73%,\nand percentage of Corey' Candies = 23\n\nWe obtain the value for Corey's candie by solving their percentage\n\n```\n\n##### Conclusion:\n\n```\nI hope you enjoy writing C++ code for solving the above questions.", "answer": "E: elevator"}

Choices: A: high B: head C: hilarious D: helium\nOutput: B: head\n```\n\n**My Solution:**\n\nUse the `re` module to parse the line input.\n\n```python\nimport re\n```\n\nSplit the input line on whitespace:\n\n```python\nline = line.split()\n```\n\n`re` is used to match a regular expression in a string.  We know that there are three question words: \"what?\" \"how much?\" \"how many?\".  So, in a pattern, find one that matches the first words from the previous questions.  Then find one that matches all three of them at once:\n\n```python \nre.match('{}(?: *[wh]at)?(?: *[hw] much)?'.format(re.escape(line[0])),line[0])\n```\n\nReplace the regex pattern with the word that the regex found matching.  This prints the first correct answer.\n\n```python \t\t\t\t\nanswer=re.match('{}{}'.format(re.group(1), line[0]),line[0]).group(1)\n```\n\nNow simply loop over the remaining words.\n\n```python    \nfor word in line[1:]:\n    if answer == '' or not re.search(f'{answer}(?: *[wh][a?]?\\em{?)',word):\n        answer=re.search('{}{}'. format(re.group(0), word),word).group(0)\n    print(answer)\n```\n\n\n**Reduced Code:**\n\nThis challenge makes assumptions about the types of questions that are in the input file. Instead of explicitly searching for the answers, we assume that the first word that we read matches the answer. We print the answer if it remains the same, otherwise we search the input line for another match.\n\n\n```python\n#!/bin/python\n\nimport re\n\nline=raw_input('Answer the following question: ')\nanswer=''\nmatch=re.match('([WH]at){0,1}'.$format(re.escape(' '.join", "answer": "A: french government"}

The length of C is 3.\n\n### Solution:\nThere are a few common mistakes that candidates make when taking this multiple choice question.First, make sure that you count the number of characters in each word. This is something that the examiners will expect you to do, and they will mark 1 point for each correct number. This means that if you put down 1 as the answer, then you will get 1 point.Second, make sure that you pay attention to the numbers after the letter of each word. This is particularly important in sentences that contain multiple numbers.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\nInput: You have to spend less time sitting and more time walking. This way, your body will burn more calories.\nOutput: A\nInput: The car's engine died during the long trip cross country. The two-seater vehicle was barely noticeable because of the rain.\nOutput: F\nInput: You can't just assume your project is guaranteed financial stability.\nOutput: C\n\nThis is a very tricky multiple choice question. The question requires you to read the sentence that follows and then to choose the answer that you think will be the least likely. The first part of the sentence states that \"you have to spend less time walking and more time sitting.\" This has some interesting implications for your body. First, your body will burn fewer calories. Second, your body will be less efficient at converting fat to energy.\nThe problem with this sentence is that the two parts of the sentence do not match. They are not equivalent. There is no way that you could do the first part of the sentence and the second part of the sentence at the same time. The fact that the sentence is not equivalent means that it is a sentence that must be answered with a multiple choice question. The only possible answer to this multiple choice question is \"A.\"\n\n### Instructions:Answer the multiple choice questions.\nInput: The city council voted on the proposal without holding a public hearing.\nOutput: A \nInput: In the middle of the last century, he traveled around the world.\nOutput: B", "answer": "C: wrong house"}

The key is not asking something that  is very generic. Instead, it is important to ask something a little more specific but still shows that you are interested in their life a lot. For example, \u201cCan we talk later tonight about whatever you want to talk about?\u201d This seems pretty generic but it does not tell you or him anything about him, and it does not imply that you want to know anything about the other person. It is also very vague and leaves room for him to say that he does not want to talk to you, especially if he says something like, \u201cWe could, but I am not really into that.\u201d Instead,  I recommend asking a question that shows a little more interest in him without seeming clingy. \u201cCould we have a longer date next weekend that is just the two of us?\u201d sounds more specific to him and what he wants out of this relationship  unlike the previous question. Of course, this depends upon if you are asking him out on a first date or asking him out on a second date  or more. It also depends upon if you are  on a date or not, but it is still generally true.", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}

Each bottle has a special label to indicate the quality and origin of the wine and also has a bottle number engraved on the bottom. One day, the chateau staff accidentally drop a load of $10$ bottles on the floor and break them. However, a few bottles have their labels torn and the numbers on the bottles are indistinguishable. The staff cannot tell which bottles were destroyed and which were merely damaged. The chateau staff needs to collect all the bottles and ask the wine connoisseur to rate them. The wine connoisseur would rate a wine on a scale of $0$ to 10, where $0$ represents poor quality wine and $10$ is a really good quality wine. The staff would only ask the wine connoiseur to rate bottles from chateau X. Chateau X has bottles from four different locations: A, B, C and D. The rating for wine from each location is different: A =$2$ B =$5$ C =$7.5$ D =$8$. The staff is wondering what would be the impact on the average rating of wines from Chateau $X$ if they remove all the bottles from location $B$ and $C$ and replace them with wines from location $A$ and $D$? \n\nLet $x$ be the ratings from location A and let $y$ be the ratings from Location D. Since the staff did remove two bottles from A and D (and replace with two bottles from location B and C), we can calculate the total increase in ratings by:$$\\text{Increase}=((2 \\cdot 2) + (2 \\cdot 2)) - ((2\\cdot 10) + (2 \\times 5))=4-4=0$$Therefore, the average rating for the chateau will decrease by $$0$$ since the quality of the wines from chateau X is reduced by $$0$$ and the number of bottles remains un", "answer": "E: university"}

{"idx": 928, "text": "C\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: The instructions ask for the \\strong{shortest} code, but that does not mean no-ops. Since we have no knowledge of the actual input, the shortest code needs to check all the possibilities, and that means having to check all six options for input a-f.\n\nUsing your code as an example, it would work for input a, but it would not work for input b, because it assumes only one letter.\n\nIn this case, however, we do more than that.

The answer will be the extracted text. There are three different HTML structure possibilities:\n```html\n<h1>Heading</h1> \n<p>Just a Paragraph</para>\n<title>The heading is the first child <em>every second element</em></title>\n```\nIn the first paragraph, the heading is the first child of every element, so the answer is \"Heading\". In the second paragraph, there is no first child every second element, so the answer will be a blank line. In the final paragraph, the heading is not a child of any element, so the answer would be the text after \"The heading is the first...\"(every second element is highlighted in gray).\n\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\nInput: What is a cat's favorite food?

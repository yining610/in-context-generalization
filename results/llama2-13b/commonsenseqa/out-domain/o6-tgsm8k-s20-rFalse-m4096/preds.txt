NLP gives computers the most basic capabilities to interpret the data, while enabling the user to use language as naturally as possible. This field is associated with many different disciplines like Artificial intelligence (AI), Computational Linguistics, Psychology, Mathematics, Statistics, Cognitive Science, Philosophy, and Cognitive Psychology.<n><n>Computers can not just interact like humans but also can understand what is being said. For a machine to understand language, it must be able to analyze, interpret, manipulate, and generate it. In recent years. NLP programs have come a long ways in analyzing and understanding texts but it still has a very long way to go in the field of natural language processing. With the help of NLTK library and some python libraries, which will have a great impact on solving text related problems, we can analyze and understand the texts and also the world at large. We can find hidden knowledge within massive unstructured text datasets, extract insights, and summarize large amounts of textual information. NLTK allows you to do this with a few lines of Python code!<n><n>NLP library in Python<n><n>The NLP has a wide range of applications, such as machine translation, information retrieval, automated summarization, sentiment analysis, natural language generation and relationship extraction.<n><n>This part is for the beginner in NLP. They can learn what is NLP, what are the applications of NLP and NLTK Python language.<n><n>We will continue for more challenges in NLP.<n><n>In our first lesson (Part 1), we will get started with NLTK. From here, we'll create word lists, learn how analyze and understand our text, summarize documents, and create models that generate text.<n><n>### 49.1 Part1:Introduction to NLP :<n><n>Never miss a new course!<n><n><n><n>Now you can master data science even if you don’t know how to code.

Thanks!<n><n>Comment: Welcome to Code Review! Can you also add the code to your question as well just in case the link ever goes dead or gets moved which is more than likely? When adding the code make sure and remove all comments for better context. Also can you try not to make it all one line? It makes it a little easier to read since the way Stackoverflow displays your code is not like your IDE. Again welcome and happy reviewing!<n><n>Comment: What are we supposed to be reviewing here? I don't see much of a question. This is also not the site for homework questions. Stack Overflow is the site for homework.<n><n>Comment: Sorry for the confusion. I'm just interested in seeing if this code is good enough for a career change. So looking for comments<n><n>Answer: \section{Naming}<n><n>Your variables all start with capital letters. In Python, variable naming conventions dictate that you should use lower case, even for classes and functions. So, you should call your function `answers` and make all of your variables `answer`.<n><n>\section{Function Logic}<n><n>If you are only ever going to return a single variable, there is no point in making this so complicated. Your existing logic is overkill.<n><n>You have a `while` loop that can iterate forever, checking for specific conditions. In this case, it is not a good idea.<n><n>What you are probably looking for is `index < len(questions)`. As your list has a fixed size, you can just keep checking to see if you are at the end of the list and return an answer. If you don't return an answer, you will keep asking the user until they answer one that is correctly.<n><n>\section{Returning Nothing}<n><n>You can return nothing using `return None` or just `return`.<n><n>\section

Please describe what you are trying to accomplish.<n><n>Comment: I am trying to solve Hackerrank problems. This page specifically is to make the solution easier to share.<n><n>Answer: Ok, so, you are writing a function that performs the desired operations.<n><n>Start by defining a single function that runs over an entire test case and passes in an object (`this.input`) that has the necessary pieces.<n><n>Then break the parts down into different steps.<n><n>First step, read the whole input into a single variable.  You'll use `String.split` to do this.<n><n>Second step, iterate over the individual elements of the input.  For each one, extract the corresponding value and store it as a property of the testing object.<n><n>Your actual `solve` function will need to know what to do with the different kinds of input.  So this might be a good time to break the whole problem down into small steps.<n><n>Ie, find out what you need to do with one kind of input.  Then create a function that takes that type of input and returns the corresponding result.  Repeat for as many types of input a problem can have.<n><n>Comment: This helped very much, but I am still stuck. The problem I am still having is that the code does not read the input. For example, it looks to a problem like this:<n><n>`Input: 1 + 2 = 3<n>Output: 3`<n><n>The code would read 1 and 2 and divide them, but then it would need to multiply the resulting answer, but I am getting stuck for that. Any ideas would be extremely appreciated!<n><n>Answer: Here is the solution to the first problem:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>let solve = function(input) {<n><n>    // Split input from new line characters<n>    let splitInput = input.split("\

For example, you will take an integer which is the question of the day and another integer which is the answer to solve this integer equation and return the value which represents one of five choices.<n><n>The first step will be to write a function to read an integer and convert this integer into a string representation of this integer.  The next step will be to ask all your input questions in a loop and keep reading an integer, converting this integer into a string and getting one line of input. After obtaining a complete set of inputs, your program will be able to start working on solving the questions in the following loop which will run until all questions are done.  The loop will solve each question by getting its entire text representation to a string variable, and then parsing the text representation of the question to find all the answers.  Finally, our program will loop over the answers and see which one of the choices has a corresponding int returned as its value so this value is printed on the standard out.<n><n>There is one more issue with your code which is that you have only written the function in C++ which converts a string to an integer and not in python.   There are two ways in which we could fix this by either implementing the same function again in python or by changing our algorithm so that the entire code can be written in python.<n>For both the algorithms we are going to keep adding each question to a variable which will keep growing as we read a new input line. However, we will only have to process one line of input at any moment. This is done because each question has its own line and thus we will always have to keep track of only the questions which are currently being solved.<n><n>As an example let us assume that your code looks like the following before the first line is read:<n><n>    q0 = "";<n>    ans = "";<n>    str = "";<n><n>    q0 will keep growing as you read in a single line, when the next line is input it will be assigned to q1, and so on. When this code runs as expected, q1 will contain all the text from the second question, so q1 will look like this:<n><n>    q1 = "\n Input: How much does David weigh? Choices:\na) 1

Choices: A: Cat C: Cat B: Cat D: Cat E: Cat C: Cat D: Dog E: Cat<n>Output: A C<n><n>Input: A farmer wants to fence the whole front of his large rectangular farm with barbed wire as cheaply as possible. But it's hard work and he has many other things to do. So he just wants to use one kind of wire for the whole front, even where there are corners. Let n be the distance around the front of the farm. Suppose that at every point where a corner would meet a wire, that wire would have to be extended. The farmer says that the length of any straight line which he would need would be exactly half the perimeter, n. What is the length of the longest straight segment of fencing wire that he could use for the whole front? Choices: A. n/2 B. 2*n/2 <n><n>### Solution<n><n>1. The shortest integer which is greater than $8 + 10$ is $11$, so the answer is $11$.<n><n>1. It took 80 minutes to talk with Tapanga and Core, so the time for each person is 40 minutes. As Corey has 5 less than Tapanga, we have: $(40 - 5) = 35$<n><n>1. The duration of a local call is 5 cents a call so all in all, it costs: $45 + 31 \times 25 = 160$ cents. So in dollars, he spent $1.60.<n><n>1. Working more than 8 hours/day could make it a health hazard, according to studies. He works 8 hours a day on Monday, Tueday and Friday.<n>Adding 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 hours, so the answer is $6$.<n><n>1. The books left from the 800 are 400, so the correct answer is $600$. <n><n>1. The total amount of money he received was $(22 \times 2) + (16 \times 2) \times 7 = 97$.<n><n>1

However, you shouldn't combine loops to tackle multiple questions on a single line. Additionally, you cannot hardcode any solution as part of your program.<n><n>### Hints:<n>1. Start off with the simplest case: question #1.<n>2. You do not need to prompt users to enter anything using the `input` statement. In other words: do not use `input('Enter the time in seconds:')`<n>3. The solution to one or more of the problems might be too small to output as a float or an integer. Instead, output the solution as a string. So if the solution is 116, output the string `"116"`<n>4. Make sure you read the `print` and `print()\n` statements carefully<n>5. The first time you run your program to check how the problems will be ordered, you should use `input('Enter any number (1-5) to get a different problem:  ')` to prompt the users to enter a value. This will ensure that the program executes one question at a time.<n>6. Feel free to use the print method `print(variable1, variable2)` for outputting two variables.<n>7. Once you have the first problem working, feel free to copy the code for the first problem then modifying it for each of the remaining problems<n>

She continued to do what? Choices:  A: gain weight B: augment C: dispare D: make larger E: expand<n>Output:		E<n> <n><n>### Solution:<n>### Solution:The first statement has a clear set of constraints.We know that 3(k1)+2.5(k2)=m and our objective is to find k1 and k2. We also know their ratio because we know that the cost is $56. Since we know the ratio we will start by plugging in 12(k1):8(k2) and try different possibilities for both k1 and k2 to solve the system.We know that (12*3):(8*2.5)=56 and 56/3=18.88... So 12x:8x=18.8. We use a little bit of algebra:<n><n>We know that we have to make k2 smaller by 7 times to make things work.<n><n>   12x:8(x-7)18.8<n><n>12x-8x*(8-7)188<n>12x*9-64x722<n><n>108x7-4887<n><n>101x7-48x77*7<n><n>100-48x7<n><n>Now that we know that k2 should be 7 we still are not done and should plug in different values of k2 until the system is satiffied.So plugging in 7 we get: 12x=18.608<n><n>3x=(3-.608)<n>x=3 and 3*k2=7.<n>Therefore k2=7 and k1=3

Choices:  A: anger B: not boredom C: stress D: boredom E: anxiety<n>Output:		D<n>```<n><n>We first need to get the instructions for this problem from the input. Let's do it with a function: `getInstructions`<n><n>```python<n>def getInstructions():<n>    instructions = []<n><n>    # Parse input until we hit the # symbol<n>    parsing = True<n>    while parsing:<n>        char_at_a_time = input().strip().lower()<n>        if char_at_a__time == '#':<n>            pass<n>        else:<n>            parsing = False<n>        instructions.append(char_at_a_thime)<n>    return instructions<n>```<n><n>Since we are just working with words, the most efficient approach would be to use wordlists to check if the words exist. We can then also save the words in a list we can use later. These words are called stop words, which are words such as articles, prepositions, etc. that don't add to the meaning of the sentence.<n><n>```python<n>from typing import Set<n><n>words = [] # The words we are going to build our vocab.<n># Stopwords list is available at: https://gutenberg.spellcheck.net/affix.py<n><n># Dictionary object used to store the words in a collection<n># A collection is a data structure containing elements that support iterability, and in some cases add additional features.<n>Dictionary = collections.defaultdict(set) # A default dict is a dict that is like an ordinary dict, except that it automatically creates keys on the fly and assigns them to empty values.<n><n># Add stopwords for each question<n>for question in instructions:<n>    words += [word.lower() for word in question.split()]<n>    # Only add words that are not stopwords<n>    for word in words:<n>        if word not in stopwords:<n>            Dictionary.setdefault(word, set()).add(question)<n>```<n><n>Now, we have a set of words and a set of questions. We need to do two things for the questions: find out the answer, and find the key where the question is stored, based on the set of words:<n><n><n>```python<n>for question in questions:<n>    # Find the question key<n>    question_key = str(set(words).intersection({word for aword in question.lower().split() for aword in word_to_

Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers that follow the numbering sequence below: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,..., n^2, (n+1)^2, (n+2)^2,... To calculate the given number return the index of the Fibonacci number that has the value of the given argument, or 1, if no such number exists. For example, if the given argument is 3, then 1 is returned, because the term n^3 from the Fibonacci sequence is zero.

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: 480<n><n>Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by only a few people recently? Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n>Output:		E<n><n><n>#### 题目详解<n><n>##### Instruction:<n><n>This question is another easy one which only requires you to know how many questions remain in the quiz, but it has some tricky options, so we will explain the options first.<n><n>The first one is "Surface of earth" which is incorrect because the air above ground has been breathed by lots of people, and it looks like there is nowhere else we can find where the air has been breathed by few people recently, unless you know a place with less than 5 people and they all have to stay there for a long time.<n><n>The second option is pretty funny, and it states that the atmosphere of mars is very similar to the earth, but scientists have not confirmed yet. Let's assume that this is true, and you can expect that scientist will visit mars soon, so the air you breathed would be from both the earth and the mars, and it seems there is no logic to this question, so you can safely eliminate this option, for now.<n><n>The 3rd option is correct which tells "inside the cricket stadium." <n><n>The idea to check this question is, <n>suppose the stadium holds 100,000 people, and the people who come to watch the game all breathed, then the air has gotten breathed many times. In other words, the air inside the cricket stadium will be breathed countless times, and you can simply eliminate this option.<n><n>The 4th option is about the house, which is a bad option because you don't know whether people in the house use air conditioner or not, and it is possible they will breathe a lot  of fresh air to avoid bacteria from the air, so this option is unacceptable.<n><n>#### 题干<n><n>This question provides two variables, X and Y. We will know their values after reading their ranges. The only difference between this question and the [Range Sum 4](./RangeSum4) is that we can see that Y also has a range. So, the key to solving this question is to understand how to calculate the minimum range of Y, then we will be in the right track to solve it.<n><n>##### Question:<n><n>Input:<n>X = [2,1,5,0]<n>Y = [2

If the key is not found in the array, NULL is returned.<n><n>The binary search algorithm works by comparing the mid-point of an array to the target value, if they are equal the position is found and the binary search is done if not then the array is divided by comparing the target value to either the first or last half of the array.  This is repeated until the algorithm finds the correct position or returns that it cannot find the position in the array.<n><n>I would implement binary search by  starting with an array and iterating through the first item in the array and then dividing that item in two and continuously moving the key to the first item in the current array in the search.  The search will have two main pieces the first is finding the maximum array index that will contain the correct item and the second is iterating over the list to find the item and stopping at that point.  This will be

Choices:  A: being understood B: beer C: playing around D: hug E: visiting friends<n>Output:		C<n><n><n>#### Solution:<n>1.  *Solution*: Let<n><n>f(p) = p,<n>g(p) = 2*p,<n>h(p) = p^2,<n><n>we get the series<n><n>\[fg(h(p) - h(g(p)))\]<n><n>which will give us the result<n><n>\[(10p^2*(3^2) - (12*4)^2\]<n><n>2.  *Solution:* The number of hours he spends per day at the gym is proportional to the<n><n>weight he can lift, which will increase with time. One hour per day implies<n><n>that the weight he is lifting is proportional to 3, since he goes 3<n><n>times per week. So the total weight he lifts per week is proportional to<n><n>3, and hence it will increase with time according to the arithmetic<n><n>sequence 3n. The amount of time he spends warming up and doing cards is one third of the time he<n><n>spends lifting weights, so it is proportional to 1.<n><n>#### Solution：<n>3. *Solution:* When you do the arithmetic problems, remember to <n><n>translate word into math language, then multiply, if it's addition add up. <n><n>Suppose it cost 200 to refuel 100% (1 tank) of the fuel tank. <n><n>The cost will go up by 20% (0.2), it's like paying (100 + 0.2) - 100 = 0.2, multiply by 200 = 40. <n><n>The other tank is costing the same amount, 200. 200 + 40, it's 16 tanks, divided by 1.2. <n><n>It is 13.33, multiply by 2 = 26. <n>

Tucker and Timothy H. R. Rice<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the 3 following questions.<n><n>1. What does it mean when a programming language is Turing-complete?<n><n>Turing-Complete means that any computable operation can be performed within the language. This is in contrast to a subset of Turing-Complete languages that can perform a limited subset of computable operations. For instance, the Python language can perform the calculations that Javascript can do, but not the other way around.<n><n>2. What are the steps you would go through to write a Python program?<n><n>   1. Think of how you want the program to work.<n>   2. Write your program (in English and in Python).<n>   3. Run your program (in Python) with an IDE or a terminal and see what the output is.<n>   4. If it works, congratulations. If it does not, then try to find and solve the bug.<n><n>3. What kind of programming environment do you use to write your Python programs, and why is this particular programming environment your choice?<n><n>I use the PyCharm IDE. It is a free Python IDE that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux systems. I choose PyCharm because I can write Python programs natively. This is also a great choice for students who want to write and execute Python code, but who do not want to learn the nitty gritty of Python code (such as how to run a Python script with the command line).<n><n># Suggestions:<n>---<n>- Use the online Python tutorial at: [python.org]  <n>- Additional reading: *An Introduction to Interpreters and Compilers by Turing Award Winner John R.

Here is an example with cost and units:<n>#<n># In <n>#<n># Adam bought <n>#<n># kilograms of nutz: units of 12 3.00<n>#<n># kilogram of dried fruits: 1.00<n># <n># dollars spent: 22 (12 × 3 + 8 × 2.5)<n>#<n># Here is the solution:<n><n>cost = unit1 * unit2 * price1 + unit1 * unit2<n>12 * 3 + 8 * 2.5<n>56 dollars<n> <n><n><n>#<n># Reasoning 17.b Answer Explanation:<n># Input Format<n># We are given two costs and two quantities in Input 17.b which is as follows:<n># For example,<n># nuts: 3.00 kg<n># fruit: 2.50 kg<n># price per kg for nuts:  12.00<n># price per kg: for fruits:  8.00<n># --------------------------------------------------------------<n>#<n># We can get this problem to be a costing problem.  For example, 1 kg of nuts is $12.  So, if he bought 3 kgs of nuts, he'd spend $36.<n># So, we'd need to figure out a general form of cost per quantity of X units.  So, the cost of nuts should follow formula:<n># cost of nuts<n>#<n># cost of nutz is 3 = units(nuts) * unit price(nuts)<n>#    1   12<n># 12 units

For<n>example, in the sentence, <code>I didn’t ask her to pass the<n>peas</code>, it does not mean that you asked her not to pass the <code>peas</code>,<n>it means that you actually wanted her to pass the peas. You can solve this kind of<n>problem by replacing problematic words with synonyms. For example, you can replace<n><code>her</code> with <code>me</code> and <code>pass</code> (which means to move)<n>with <code>hand</code> (which would make sense in this context). If we make these<n>replacements, then the sentence is correctly <code>I asked me to hand me the<n>peas.</code><n><n>Given a hidden meaning sentence, such as <code>I asked for time off due to<n>health</code>, return the <code>new_sentence</code>. If there are multiple<n>solutions, return <code>ALL</code>.

For each test case, your program must either print the line "OK" on one line, or print "E1621" on one line.  Output must be exactly one line.  If it is an error, there must be no leading or trailing whitespace, nor spaces between the "E" and "1621".   Output lines must have an exact length of 9 characters and there must be no trailing whitespace on any output line.  There must be 10 blank lines after the last input line in addition to the blank line following each line of output.<n><n>##### 2) This set of three programs calculates the result of a coin toss.

Your program should read all of the line entries from the CSV file and output the 2019 field values of each of the 4 line entries in each row.  If it were possible to have lines in the CSV file that have fewer than 4 fields, then your code should ignore any lines in the CSV file with fewer than 4 fields.  If any line in the CSV file is not formatted correctly, the line should  be ignored, and your program should exit with an error message.  The first field is always a timestamp. The first 4 fields are the location data, which are the longitude and latitude of the location. The next field is the weather code, which uses the ISO-standard two-letter code (see wiktionary:climate_codes) for the type of weather. (e.g. 'T' stands for clear sky).

The function is called a class while the method is called an instance. One can think about a function as a collection of methods. In computer programming it is not too dissimilar from a library. Some advantages are that it can be used globally, it is reusable. Some drawbacks include functions that can be invoked in multiple methods, some of which may be the same. <n><n>**What are some advantages and disadvantages of using classes?**  <n><n>### ** Some advantages include the fact that it can be used for any number of methods and is extremely flexible in that way. It allows for the possibility of inheritance. One disadvantage could be that if a function is used that is in a class method in another class it may not be the same as the class that is being called. If the function is in a similar one though it could change its output from whats being called in one class. <n><n>** What is the difference between a class and an object?**  <n><n><n>### ** The difference is: A Class is the blueprint for a program, while an object is an instantiation of a class.**<n><n>### _What did you learn this week? _<n><n>**I learned the difference between methods and objects.

In my experience, bind is more a verb, "to fasten or confine by a bond or tie". Hold, in my experience, implies a verb; "Tie it to the chair/hold it in place with an object." But, my answer does say *"I would not be surprised if this question was written by someone with a 5th grade vocabulary (because most people could look it up rather than know or use it).... Hold, in my opinion, gives all these answers, and a couple more.  I would also accept - tightened, bound, and packaged - none of which I see when I hear the word hold."*<n><n>Comment: In fact, I added - to this answer that the word "hold" does not mean "tie or bind or fasten together, or hold up", but in fact I think it can mean tie or bind or fasten or hold up, and so forth.

When the training data set in machine learning has some missing data, the probability is often used as a way to estimate the missing data.<n><n>### Question :You have a machine learning dataset. You want to change the machine learning algorithm and repeat training using 10x more data (by merging several months of data). Do you need to increase the learning rate, add momentum, add weight decay or use a decay scheduler?<n><n>### Anser: The amount of machine learning data does not affect the learning rate. However, adding more data can cause “problems” by “overfitting” the training data and thereby not having valid results. Adding “more data” to the same network can cause the network to fit the increased data better than the data is fitted the smaller network. To solve this issue. A way to go is to increase the learning rate until you see that the increase is lower. Then you know that it is better to use weight decay, momentum, or add a decay schedule. <n><n>### Question A company is preparing for their annual conference. 550 people have signed up to attend the first day of the conference, 325 are expected to attend the second day, and 75 people are slated to present on both days of the conference (including some of the attendees).

The first statement says that "Adam bought 3 kilogmeas of nuts and 3 kilograms dried fruit at a store." The second statement says "one kilogram of nuts is as expensive as one kilogram of drier fruits." The third statement tells us that the price of nuts is $12 per kilogram.<n><n>The nuts cost $36 by themselves. The dried fruits cost $20 by themselves. All together, the cost adds up to $56.<n><n>>The total purchase of Adam costs $56.<n>In this question, they give us the information that John goes to the gym three times a week. The problem states that an hour of lifting weights is spent in one hour. For every hour lifting weights, the problem specifies, he spends an hour and 30 minutes on warming up and cardio.<n><n>Now when we do the math, we see that he goes over two hours for lifting weights. So the total amount of time he goes to the gym is 2 hours and 30 minutes to three hours. The final answer is 4.<n><n>>In this problem, we are given information that the cost of refilling the tank was $200 at some time of a.  Now you are told that he buys a larger tank to double his fuel. Also, fuel prices rose by 20%. Since James bought a larger tank, he gets 40% more fuel; so the price rises more than 20%.<n>><n>>A 480 would be equal to 600 if fuel prices rose 20%. To double the fuel price, he must get three times as much for 480 of the new fuel at 600.<n>><n>>Thus, he gets $22700 as the new fuel price for the new tank he bought. <n><n>>The final answer to this problem would be $2, 270.<n>In this question we are given information that James has to refuel the plane and it

The second time it appears, we know the first was at index 0, so the second time must be at index 1.

There is also a 100 km distance allowance that is given to a passenger for a bag. So, in which of the following situations, a passenger pays less for carrying a small bag in the same aircraft?<n>S1: The distance between his/her domestic destination city and his/her origin city is less than 100 km.<n>S2: He/she has bought his/her ticket in return for using an airline miles credit card, which gives a discount on tickets on domestic flights.<n>S3: His/her distance of 100 km allowance is already filled up with other bags and he/she therefore carries a small bag.<n>S4: He/she carries a small bag but his/her distance allowance is less than 140 km, after factoring in other bags in the aircraft.<n><n>Output: (B) Difference of opinion of experts.<n><n>1. Some say that the distance allowance of 100km is to be given independently of the free check-in luggage allowance(if any). In that case, S3 holds and S4 does not hold but S2 does hold<n>2. Some say bags are treated holistically, so if a passenger is allowed 150 km of distance allowance, then he/she can carry two small bags of 100 and 50 km, respectively (after factoring in other baggages being carried), then S3 is false, S4 is true. In that case, S2 does not hold.<n><n>```<n>3. What this question has to make it clear is how is “distance allowance” accounted for in calculating what extra charges the passenger will have to pay for bags.<n>```<n><n>Input:<n>Sriparna is an avid biker.

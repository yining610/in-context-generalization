The cost of nut is $12/kg, of dried fruits is $8. How much are his purchases.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThis is exactly asking you what's written in the question: he bought 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 kg. 1 kg of nut is 12 so he bought 12 * 3 + 8 * 2.5 = $44 kg. But $12 doesn't round up, because the question is about integer answer, so the actual answer is 55\n\nAnswer: For the last one, first try to figure out what the question is asking.\n\nThen just look for a function that can help you in Python or if you are good enough, you can write your own function.\n\nIn this case, write your own function like\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef what_c(b,c):\n   return b + c\n\\end{code}.\n\nThen run your code.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nwhat = what_c(4,5)\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize\u00bb\n  \\item what == 9\n\\end{itemize\u00bb\n\nComment: I don't understand what this question means and how do I write a function?\n\nAnswer: What the problem essentially asks for is the", "answer": "D: street"}

The truck currently emits $0.10$ of exhaust for each second. You want to drive until you have to spend another $0.10$.\n\nAt this point, you stop your vehicle for a $0.05$ service so that your next $0.10$) will cost you $0.05$.\n\nNow, you have $0.10 \\times 60$ seconds  remaining but now you burn $0.05 \\times 60 = 0.10$ as you did, for the next 60$  seconds after this, but you get a further reduction of $0.05 - 0.10 = -0.05$ to your next $0.05$).\n\nWhat is the greatest number of seconds you can drive before you will no longer be able to drive?\n\nPlease note that this is a dynamic optimization problem. You get the most money when you get the truck  up and running as soon as possible. Let's do some maths to get a good initial  guess. Consider:\n\n$$X = \\frac {\\int_{0}^{60} \\frac{0.05^2}{60} d x} {60 - \\int_{0}^{6} 0.05 dx} \\approx 0.019796875$$\n\nSo on average when we take into consideration everything, it takes $0.0198$ seconds for $0.05^4$ seconds before we've finished the service.\n\nWe will use this value plus a loop to solve the problem\n\ndef solution (", "answer": "A: reach tentative agreement"}

The weight of the object is represented in Pounds, the distance between 2 cities is in Miles and dollars is represented by the amount of money it costs to travel from one city to another.\n\n### How the program works\n\n*The program will calculate the weight using the formula that is already inserted inside the Python Script.\n\n*After calculating the weight using the formula, the program will ask you to fill in the correct distance amount of both cities and their respective dollar amount.\n\n*The program then asks for one input, which is the mode of transportation. The user will need to input the mode of transportation that will be used to travel from one city destination to another. The program then calculates the distance and adds it in a sum to the cost of the ride.\n\n*After adding the two variables and the formula, the user then clicks the total cost button, which can be seen on the far bottom of the screen. Upon clicking it, the total cost will appear on the screen.\n\n*Then, the user then clicks on the reset button, which is right next to the total cost button. Then, the user will need to enter a new city's distance and its costs. The program will then output the new city's total cost without resetting the values.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n* In case only one variable appears in the middle of the screen, delete the other variables and replace them with the new one input by the user.\n* In case one or both variables appear to appear and have a wrong value, the user will need a new entry and will need to reset the program.\n\n\n\n\n## Questions:\n- [ ] How did you iterate over a list?\n- [ ] How would you change this by inserting random words?\n- [ ] What is the difference between a list and a tuple?\n- [ ] Why is it necessary to define variables?\n- [ ] Which variable type would you use to store a persons address?\n- [ ] Define a variable inside a def function.\n- [ ] What are different ways to find the length of a list?\n-  [ ] How do you concatenate a string with a string?\n\n### Additional questions:", "answer": "C: city"}

Since we know the ratio we will start by plugging in 12(k1):8(k2) and try different possibilities for both k1 and k2 to solve the system.We know that (12*3):(8*2.5)=56 and 56/3=18.88...

Let's do it with a function: `getInstructions`\n\n```python\ndef getInstructions():\n    instructions = []\n\n    # Parse input until we hit the # symbol\n    parsing = True\n    while parsing:\n        char_at_a_time = input().strip().lower()\n        if char_at_a__time == '#':\n            pass\n        else:\n            parsing = False\n        instructions.append(char_at_a_thime)\n    return instructions\n```\n\nSince we are just working with words, the most efficient approach would be to use wordlists to check if the words exist. We can then also save the words in a list we can use later. These words are called stop words, which are words such as articles, prepositions, etc. that don't add to the meaning of the sentence.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Set\n\nwords = [] # The words we are going to build our vocab.\n# Stopwords list is available at: https://gutenberg.spellcheck.net/affix.py\n\n# Dictionary object used to store the words in a collection\n# A collection is a data structure containing elements that support iterability, and in some cases add additional features.\nDictionary = collections.defaultdict(set) # A default dict is a dict that is like an ordinary dict, except that it automatically creates keys on the fly and assigns them to empty values.\n\n# Add stopwords for each question\nfor question in instructions:\n    words += [word.lower() for word in question.split()]\n    # Only add words that are not stopwords\n    for word in words:\n        if word not in stopwords:\n            Dictionary.setdefault(word, set()).add(question)\n```\n\nNow, we have a set of words and a set of questions. We need to do two things for the questions: find out the answer, and find the key where the question is stored, based on the set of words:\n\n\n```python\nfor question in questions:\n    # Find the question key\n    question_key = str(set(words).intersection({word for aword in question.lower().split() for aword in word_to_", "answer": "C: stress"}

Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers that follow the numbering sequence below: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,..., n^2, (n+1)^2, (n+2)^2,... To calculate the given number return the index of the Fibonacci number that has the value of the given argument, or 1, if no such number exists. For example, if the given argument is 3, then 1 is returned, because the term n^3 from the Fibonacci sequence is zero.

Let's assume that this is true, and you can expect that scientist will visit mars soon, so the air you breathed would be from both the earth and the mars, and it seems there is no logic to this question, so you can safely eliminate this option, for now.\n\nThe 3rd option is correct which tells \"inside the cricket stadium.\" \n\nThe idea to check this question is, \nsuppose the stadium holds 100,000 people, and the people who come to watch the game all breathed, then the air has gotten breathed many times. In other words, the air inside the cricket stadium will be breathed countless times, and you can simply eliminate this option.\n\nThe 4th option is about the house, which is a bad option because you don't know whether people in the house use air conditioner or not, and it is possible they will breathe a lot  of fresh air to avoid bacteria from the air, so this option is unacceptable.\n\n#### \u9898\u5e72\n\nThis question provides two variables, X and Y. We will know their values after reading their ranges. The only difference between this question and the [Range Sum 4](./RangeSum4) is that we can see that Y also has a range. So, the key to solving this question is to understand how to calculate the minimum range of Y, then we will be in the right track to solve it.\n\n##### Question:\n\nInput:\nX = [2,1,5,0]\nY = [2", "answer": "B: house"}

If the key is not found in the array, NULL is returned.\n\nThe binary search algorithm works by comparing the mid-point of an array to the target value, if they are equal the position is found and the binary search is done if not then the array is divided by comparing the target value to either the first or last half of the array.  This is repeated until the algorithm finds the correct position or returns that it cannot find the position in the array.\n\nI would implement binary search by  starting with an array and iterating through the first item in the array and then dividing that item in two and continuously moving the key to the first item in the current array in the search.  The search will have two main pieces the first is finding the maximum array index that will contain the correct item and the second is iterating over the list to find the item and stopping at that point.

They use these code languages to organize their instructions into a step-by-step process to solve a problem!\n\n### Discursion: What Is Programming or Code?\nProgramming or code can be broken down into three categories:\n\n* Syntax (grammar)\n* Semantics (logic)\n* Pragmatics (convention)\n\n### Discusstion: What is syntax?\nSyntax is the language a computer follows to tell computers what to execute.\n\n### Disccussion: What is Logic?\nLogic is the ability to think intelligently and apply it to our understanding of how computers work to follow the instructions!\n\n### Disscussion: What are the conventions of coding?\nThese are the rules of the programming language. This is especially true because there are many coding languages, and they can very from syntax to syntax! For instance, Python is a coding language that uses indentation, while Java uses curly braces.\n\n### Dissencting What is the difference between syntax and logic?\n\nWhile the language tells the computer what to execute, logic comes into play!

One hour per day implies\n\nthat the weight he is lifting is proportional to 3, since he goes 3\n\ntimes per week. So the total weight he lifts per week is proportional to\n\n3, and hence it will increase with time according to the arithmetic\n\nsequence 3n. The amount of time he spends warming up and doing cards is one third of the time he\n\nspends lifting weights, so it is proportional to 1.\n\n#### Solution\uff1a\n3. *Solution:* When you do the arithmetic problems, remember to \n\ntranslate word into math language, then multiply, if it's addition add up. \n\nSuppose it cost 200 to refuel 100% (1 tank) of the fuel tank. \n\nThe cost will go up by 20% (0.2), it's like paying (100 + 0.2) - 100 = 0.2, multiply by 200 = 40. \n\nThe other tank is costing the same amount, 200. 200 + 40, it's 16 tanks, divided by 1.2. \n\nIt is 13.33, multiply by 2 = 26.", "answer": "A: being understood"}

Since (x+y+Z) can be anything from 5 to 9, it looks like we have a total of 8 different values for (x+y+7).\n\nIn other words, there are 8 triples we can have in which X,Y and Z are  greater than 1, and in each of these triples, (x+y+y) =10. There are 7 different values we can choose for Y. Thus, we have a total of  7 x 8 = 56 triples.   \nThe answer to the question is :\n56\n\nInput : How many different positive integer triples (x, y, z) satisfy x+y+z =8?\nOutput : 56\n\n### Input: A bag of oranges, bananas and apples costs $1.60 today.

Rice\n\n### Instruction:Answer the 3 following questions.\n\n1. What does it mean when a programming language is Turing-complete?\n\nTuring-Complete means that any computable operation can be performed within the language. This is in contrast to a subset of Turing-Complete languages that can perform a limited subset of computable operations. For instance, the Python language can perform the calculations that Javascript can do, but not the other way around.\n\n2. What are the steps you would go through to write a Python program?\n\n   1. Think of how you want the program to work.\n   2. Write your program (in English and in Python).\n   3. Run your program (in Python) with an IDE or a terminal and see what the output is.\n   4. If it works, congratulations. If it does not, then try to find and solve the bug.\n\n3. What kind of programming environment do you use to write your Python programs, and why is this particular programming environment your choice?\n\nI use the PyCharm IDE. It is a free Python IDE that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux systems. I choose PyCharm because I can write Python programs natively. This is also a great choice for students who want to write and execute Python code, but who do not want to learn the nitty gritty of Python code (such as how to run a Python script with the command line).\n\n# Suggestions:\n---\n- Use the online Python tutorial at: [python.org]  \n- Additional reading: *An Introduction to Interpreters and Compilers by Turing Award Winner John R. Hopcroft, Jeffrey D. Ullman, Alberto A. Mertins*\n\n### Instructions:Complete the following 4 exercises:\n\n1.

For\nexample, in the sentence, <code>I didn\u2019t ask her to pass the\npeas</code>, it does not mean that you asked her not to pass the <code>peas</code>,\nit means that you actually wanted her to pass the peas.

For example, you can replace\n<code>her</code> with <code>me</code> and <code>pass</code> (which means to move)\nwith <code>hand</code> (which would make sense in this context). If we make these\nreplacements, then the sentence is correctly <code>I asked me to hand me the\npeas.</code>\n\nGiven a hidden meaning sentence, such as <code>I asked for time off due to\nhealth</code>, return the <code>new_sentence</code>.

It returns the\nmatching regular expression. (If there are multiple matches, using.finditer\nwith a regular expression would be better.)\n\nThere are some examples from the website which are shown below\n\n\\begin{code}\n\nimport string\nimport sys\nimport re\n\n# These regular expressions will match any letters of the alphabet (lower\n# or upper-case), or digits.

The pattern \"0*\"\n # matches a zero which matches zero or more times.\n# The pattern \"(?)2\" matches a \"2\" followed by a single question mark,\n # which keeps the last capture group and makes the whole match non\n # greedy. Without the question mark and the parentheses, the\n # match would stop one character earlier, and capture only the\n # \"2\".\ntwo_digits = re.compile(\nr\"^(\\d*2)(\\d{2})$\n\")\n\n# This expression matches a string with a pattern of digits in the\n # second half and the same pattern of digits in the first half.\n# Digits that appear on the left border must first appear on the\n # right border, before being matched on the left.\n# The pattern \"[abc]\" is used here as a shorthand for \"[a-bc]\".\n# This means that \"a\" can match \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\".\n# The pattern is repeated with the \"(\" and \")\" characters escaped, as\n# we want the \"(\" and \"}\" characters to match themselves.\nsame_digits = re\n re.", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

The function is called a class while the method is called an instance. One can think about a function as a collection of methods. In computer programming it is not too dissimilar from a library. Some advantages are that it can be used globally, it is reusable. Some drawbacks include functions that can be invoked in multiple methods, some of which may be the same. \n\n**What are some advantages and disadvantages of using classes?**  \n\n### ** Some advantages include the fact that it can be used for any number of methods and is extremely flexible in that way. It allows for the possibility of inheritance. One disadvantage could be that if a function is used that is in a class method in another class it may not be the same as the class that is being called. If the function is in a similar one though it could change its output from whats being called in one class. \n\n** What is the difference between a class and an object?**  \n\n\n### ** The difference is: A Class is the blueprint for a program, while an object is an instantiation of a class.**\n\n### _What did you learn this week? _\n\n**I learned the difference between methods and objects.

When the training data set in machine learning has some missing data, the probability is often used as a way to estimate the missing data.\n\n### Question :You have a machine learning dataset. You want to change the machine learning algorithm and repeat training using 10x more data (by merging several months of data). Do you need to increase the learning rate, add momentum, add weight decay or use a decay scheduler?\n\n### Anser: The amount of machine learning data does not affect the learning rate. However, adding more data can cause \u201cproblems\u201d by \u201coverfitting\u201d the training data and thereby not having valid results. Adding \u201cmore data\u201d to the same network can cause the network to fit the increased data better than the data is fitted the smaller network. To solve this issue. A way to go is to increase the learning rate until you see that the increase is lower. Then you know that it is better to use weight decay, momentum, or add a decay schedule. \n\n### Question A company is preparing for their annual conference. 550 people have signed up to attend the first day of the conference, 325 are expected to attend the second day, and 75 people are slated to present on both days of the conference (including some of the attendees).

Some say bags are treated holistically, so if a passenger is allowed 150 km of distance allowance, then he/she can carry two small bags of 100 and 50 km, respectively (after factoring in other baggages being carried), then S3 is false, S4 is true. In that case, S2 does not hold.\n\n```\n3.

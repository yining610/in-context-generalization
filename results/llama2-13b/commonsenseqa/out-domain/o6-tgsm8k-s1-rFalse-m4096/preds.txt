Use the table to help you.<n><n>Money can be exchanged for goods and services called things. Things are grouped into categories. Some of these categories include shoes, groceries, and toys. It can cost money to do these things. Many people must work to earn money, but there are other ways to get money. When people make their own money from money that someone else has earn, that money is called income.<n><n>### You Have No Money at this Time<n>You have a total of $0. You have the option to buy or sell in a stock market or by investing in a bond with a guaranteed return or by renting out some of your old things. Each of these options has a different return rate. See the table below:<n><n>| Option | Return Rate |<n>| ------------ | ------------ |<n>| Rent Out | 400% |<n>| Bond | 200% |<n><n>### Return Rate Descriptions<n>Return rates explain what will happen to your money if you have a positive or negative balance for each option. A positive balance explains what happens when you have more money than you started with. For example, if you put $20.00 in each option that has a positive return rate, you will earn more money. In most cases you will earn it twice as fast or four times as fast. You will not lose more than the amount you started with in any of these options. Let's check it out with some examples. Let's say that you buy $20.01 of bonds and they have a return rate of 20%. This means in 28 days your account will be worth $24. You will have spent $20.02, but gained 40 cents. This makes your profit 2%. Here are the other examples:<n><n>| Amount Invested | Bond Return (%) | Days | Amount Left |<n>| --------- | --------- | ------------ | -------- |<n>| $20.0 | 20% | 8 | $24 |<n>| $26.01 | 20% (1 day) | 7 | $33.64 |<n>

Choices:  A: books B: france C: fish market D: atlantic ocean E: cuba<n>Output:		a<n>Explanation: Sam ordered a blowfish in Paris, in France. This is a direct answer, so this one should be obvious, and the correct answer is a (France).<n><n>Answer: B<n><n><n><Hint: <n>You cannot just add 89 - 3 + 7 * 6. Use algebra to solve this correctly.<n></Hint><n><n><Hint:<n>The allowance is $5 + $10, so the total amount of money is $15 + $65 + $2.  How can you use the values to tell if $100 is the correct answer?<n></Hint><n>  <n><Hint: 23*2(4) + 3(2)= 322<n></Hint><n>    <Hint: 1.2*4<n></Hint><n><Hint: 10+2+4x1.25<n></Hint><n></Hint><n>    <Hint:<n>The problem states "...if his team scores 290 the league record will be broken..." Now consider the score and the goal per player:<n>S = 10,430<n>Goal avg. per player = 290<n>Total team players = 4 <n>So 10,400/290 = 4x<n>The total team players is the factor used in the equation. 290 is the goal  per player. They are looking for a minimum average per player score.  So if they had to average 27 less per player, that means the minimum average they need will need to be 263 per player.  Let's say they are 8 points short of the record (283 * 4) the team must score 112 points (283 - 112) to tie the record (27+283).<n></Hint><n>    <Hint: <n>The equation to use is:   <n>Total time = time of 2 subjects * 2x time of 1 subject<n><n>20 * 2x time in history<n><n>We know how long that will take to complete each subject, if he spends 20 minutes on math and 3 times that amount of time on history, then that will be, as he is taking three subjects:<n><n>20 = 3

She used 3 stickers on the front book.<n>**89 − 3 = 86**,<n>* **86/23 = 3.78.**<n><n>**Q2** : The answer is 3.<n><n>**Q3** : 23kangaroos * 2 legs/kangaroo = **116.**<n>* **3x 116 = 348**, **4 legs*4 = 16.**<n><n>**116 + 348 + 16 = 320.**<n><n>**Note:** The parentheses are also important in algebra. If the calculations in the parenthesis are reversed, it might give the wrong answer. For example, 8 / 4 is 2, but when we reverse the parenthesis to *4/8 it becomes 1/2 because it performs the action within the parentheses with reversing the operations.<n><n>**Q4** : **6 + 20 – 10 = 18,** 15 * 1.25 = 18.75, so 3 is the result.<n><n>**Note: A minus sign is a subtraction and a minus in front of a number is a negative.**<n>For example: 50 -4 = 46 and -4*6 = -24 when we want to subtract the negative signs.<n><n>**Q5** : We can calculate this problem by looking at three different ways.<n><n>1). Average of 287 is 28.7. Josh bought a hat for 10. So 28.7 + 10 = 38.7 and he needs to buy two more things.<n>2

For number 9 enter 1.<n>For number 10 enter the number of the day of the month you were born.<n>```<n><n>#### Output: <n><n>```<n>Your last question had N inputs. For number N enter 100.<n>For number 0 enter your favorite color.<n>For number 327013 enter your birth month (JAN-DEC)<n>For number 53528 enter your birth year (YYYY)<n>```<n><n>#### Notes:<n><n>N is the number of inputs for the last question, and then you have to enter "100", "your favorite color", and "your birth year".  For "your birth year", you have to use four digits in ascending order, which makes "2032" the only possible answer for that question.  After I entered "2032", it skipped to the next question.<n><n>#### Hints:<n><n>The last three questions are not related to the rest and don't depend on each other, so I think they were just tests to make sure the inputs were valid.  I'm not sure what the second to last question is trying to see, though.  It may have to do with the fact that inputs always had to be 1-15.<n><n>#### Bonus Questions:<n>

He only played 15 minutes in the fourth quarter, so he averaged 6 points, 2 assist, 2 rebounds per game in the fourth quarter. If he played 36 minutes in total, what points did he average for the entire game if averages are rounded to the nearest whole number?<n>Output: 9<n><n>Answer: First, we are told that the player averaged 16 points in the first three quarters, 12 points in the last quarter, 16 points in three quarters, equals 32 points in three quarters. 12 divided by 32 is 38%, so in three quarters, the player scored <n>38% of a total expected amount. He did not play in the last quarter, and we are told that he played <n>15 minutes, so we are told that <n>26% of that total amount, the 38%, was for that quarter. We can take it from this that this <n>26% must be part of a 40% total, as <n>26% out of 40% is 10.4, so 32 points in the first three divided by 40 plus 10.4 in the last divided by 40 is<n><n>9 per point in three quarters and 10.4 per point in the last <n>16 or a quarter in total.<n><n>Input: During the first three quarters a basketball player averages 11 points 1 rebounds<n>and 4 assists per quarter.

If so, how did you approach them?<n><n>There was indeed a couple of questions I had never seen before. The question that stumped me the most was about eggs due to the complicated estimation involved with that question. However, I managed to get to the right answer in the end with the help of my classmate.<n><n>* Do you notice any patterns to the difficulty of the questions?  Can you explain what they are?<n><n>Yes, the questions before midterm examination and after the midterm are different in difficulty. Before the examination, the questions were very easy and would sometimes involve primary operations. However, after the examination, the difficulty level of the questions seemed to increase by a small margin. This might be due to the fact that the midterm examination is only focusing on one subject while after the examinations, the school is also teaching other subjects which are at a slightly higher difficulty level than the subject tested on the midterm exams.<n><n>

After simplifying the equation, 44 is the only output that satisfies our condition.<n><n>```python<n>input('Enter the number of Stickers Mary has remaining: ')<n><n>stickers = eval(input("Enter the number of stickers: "))<n><n>page1 = int(input("Enter the numbe of stickers for the front page: "))<n>pages = int(input("enter the number of pages: "))<n><n><n>final_stickers = stickers-page1*7-pages*3<n><n>print(final_stickers)<n>```<n><n>Another good way to get the result is to use **Modulo Operator**.<n><n>**Modulo Operator** is also known as **Remainder Operator**.  It returns the remainder from the division of its arguments.<n><n>The first argument is the **dividend**, the second argument is the **divisor**.  The operator can operate on the number of digits in the first argument. The **modulo operator** is usually written as `%`.  In this example, the answer is `89 %7`.<n><n>This is the same as simplifying by *7* first and then by *pages*, which is *7/3* = *2* *pages*.<n><n><n>### Challenge<n><n>**Issues**:<n>1. Simply reading the answers from the input and print out is not solving problems.  I must learn to **solve problems.**<n>2. It is not possible to write everything in Python, so the key is to convert those complex situations into simple

By using `\w` instead of `[a-z]` you're telling Python to use the built-in [word boundary regular expression `\B`](https://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html). This uses the [Boyer-Moore algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm) to optimize the regex's performance.<n>\item When you get to the point in the program where you don't understand how something works, start by searching through the documentation. For instance, Python's documentation of `re.search` [starts here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), and this section specifically talks about the built-in [Boyer-Moorer optimization](https://docs.pythonsprint.org/3/re.search.html#optimizations).<n>\end{itemize}<n><n>Answer: In your code, you use `^a+b+$` to match 'Ab' and 'baa

Let's take a step back and write out the problem.<n>The problem states  Mary had 89  stickers.  She bought  3 large  stickers on the front  page of her journal,  but also used other stickers to 6 other  pages of her journal. Therefore, let's rewrite the question as:<n>$$89-3=86$$<n>How many stickers does Mary has remaining?<n>#### 2. Can we solve for our variables?<n>In this case, we are not sure what Mary "used" the rest of them on. However, we do know that  Mary has 86  stickers remaining.<n>#### 3. Let's plug in our numbers into the formulas.<n>##### Step 1:<n>Plug in our solution.<n>$86 = (7 \cdot 86))$<n><n>##### Step 2:<n><n>Solve.<n>$860 = 608$<n>Now that we have a final answer,  lets plug and chug.<n>$46 = 860-608$<n>Therefore, Mary has 44 stickers remaining.<n><n>#### 4. How do we know our answer is correct<n>We know that Mary used  $7 \cdot 8=60$  stickers out of these $86$ to adorn each other six pages. However, out of these $89$  stickers we used  $3$  extra  $=27$  stickers.<n><n>#### 5. Try again<n>- Mary had 5  stickes.  She bought  50  stickes and 2  sticks for her cat. How many stickes were left to decorate her journal?<n>$$100-2=98$$<n><n>#### 6. Take notes<n>$$\begin{array}{}<n>86\cdot7  =\text {(1)}\\<n>27\cdot2   =\text {(2)

As soon as I had my variables set with the input amounts and then I created the variables with either an integer (23) or float(1.25). I then knew how the code would turn out and what amounts to ask for or put into the code.<n># ## Step4: I had to keep practicing and going up and down finding the answer for the amount I gave input until I finally got the correct answer for the problems. Once I got one correct answer, I was able to use that information to solve the next one as well.<n># ## Step5: I had to go to the internet and find out the correct format for each of the inputs so I can start to put the right input in order for the right output to return.<n># ## Step6: With this, I was able to get all of the right inputs and outputs and see how each piece of code works for the values that I have input. If these values didn't work, I would know to keep trying others until a correct outcome was achieved.<n># # ### This is my First time doing Python and trying these type of problems and this is My First

I would like that someone would share some knowledge about the questions that I am answering.<n><n>Answer: Let's see, shall we?<n>\begin{itemize}<n>\item If you are given a number as an input and it is required that you get a certain answer, you can loop while it is not equal to \begin{code}<n><what_you_want><n>\end{code}.<n>\item If you get multiple inputs, you should put them in an array. Then you should `if`, `or`, `and` them as needed.<n>\item If you have a situation in which the inputs have specific relationships, you can write a conditional that will test if those relationships are correct.<n>\item If the inputs are required to be sequential, you can assign them in the loop for easy testing.<n>\end{itemize}<n><n>Comment: Thank you so much! However, I am just wondering if any of you have any knowledge about using a class to make the program more efficient. The code that I posted has the 8 different questions and I would like to make different classes for each question.<n><n>Comment: I agree. A class for each question is ideal. The `input` is a variable, however, so it makes a difference whether you want to keep that in a variable or not. If you do, you would also need to add in a separate program or call to set the value of input. I would probably recommend making the class, but not make input anything special.<n><n>Comment: @ZachChao if an answer helped you, please consider to mark it as accepted<n><n>Answer: \begin{blockquote}<n><n>I

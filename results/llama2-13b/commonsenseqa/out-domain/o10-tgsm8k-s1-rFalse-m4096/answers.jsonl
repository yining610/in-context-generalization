The medical emergency does not necessarily require that the person in question skip the dinner, but skipping dinner would allow for the person to receive medical treatment at an earlier time. \n\nUnfortunately, the members of the family do not agree on who should skip dinner. The parents will not allow the oldest son to skip dinner because they worry about him skipping school in the morning. The second-oldest son also thinks that the oldest son should be allowed to skip dinner. This would allow him to play golf at the local golf course by himself. The youngest son is the only one in the family who is enthusiastic to let the oldest son skip dinner. If the oldest son is not allowed to skip dinner, then he might be able to convince his parents to let him skip school in the morning. In that case, only the youngest daughter would go to school. The oldest and youngest daughters also think that it is important for one of them to skip school.\n\nThe person who goes to school that morning is excited because she gets the opportunity to get a head-start on school-work.

In this introductory unit, we will explore the question of learning by trying to simulate learning using code.\n\nThere are two approaches to learning - knowledge-based and intelligence-based. Knowledge-based learning happens when we read books, listen to lectures, or learn from an experienced person. Intelligence-based learning happens when a machine (computer, AI) takes a given task, and comes up with its own solution through a lot of trial and error. This process is called learning-by-doing, that is, try-and-fail.\n\nLet's explore how learning by trial-and-error works.\n\nWe have two variables in \"learning.r\": `x` and `y`.

Here I will show the first way that I figure out this problem.\n\n- For example,  I assume, he can get his $100 bike by Friday.\n\n- So I have to find the time/day when he can get that bike by Friday. Which is  he can get the bike by Friday by getting it on Wednesday.  Or else, it is going to take more time. It's going to take him until Friday until he get the bike.  So that means, Wednesday will be the earliest day that he can reach his goal to get the bike.\n\n- So he gets his $10 bike on Wednesday. That means after Wednesday, he has to earn an additional $60 more. He has $65 before he gets the $10 bike.  He gets $10 so he has $75 total left after he gets his bike.  He will get his bike on Wednesady.\n\n- So Wednesday is a day before Friday.\n\n- I am going to use Wednesday as a day that he gets the bike.  Then if he earns $75 more money on that Wednesday. He should be able to buy his bike.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\n\n    input_list1 = sys.stdin\n    output_list = sys.stdout\n    input_list2 = sys.stdin3", "answer": "C: three feet"}

{"idx": 667, "text": "A\n\n####### Instruction:Answer the question below.\n\n> Which of the following numbers should be used as a value for the variable `n`?  \n\n### Solution\n\n**Plain English:** How do you determine if a number is divisible by 3? The way to do this is to divide the number by 3 and check for a remainder. If there is **no remainder**, then the original number is **divisible**, otherwise, it is not necessarily divisible.\n\n> What is the remainder for the following situation: 7988 is divided by 33?\n\n**Plain Examples:** When we are dealing with integers, there are two possible remainders: 0 and -1 (when we are subtracting 3). In reality, there are five possible remainders: 2, 1, 0, -1, and -2. We can check the list for divisibility rules and find that 7988 divided by 33 remains 0. \n\n> Consider the following: 1100 is divided by 32. What is the remainder?\n\n**Plainer English:** Divide 1100 by 32 again and check the remainders. This time, the remainder is -1, so the original number cannot be divisible. To verify our answer, we can check the other three divisibility rules for -1, but we don't need to as it is self-evident that 1100 *cannot* be divisible. If it can, then what is 1099? Do we really need to test all the other divisibility rules in our head?\n\n> You are playing a game where you roll two dice. What is the probability of rolling two even numbers?\n\n**Placement:** Our problem is a probability question, so we will need to use the probability tool. As I mentioned, I think this tool would be useful for other questions as well. **What we did was to add one or more 50% probabilities to get to the total number.** This is a standard way to compute probabilities and should be covered in most schools.\n\n> You roll a 20-sided die and get 7.  What is the probability that an even number greater than 5 was rolled?\n\n### Solution", "answer": "D: kind"}

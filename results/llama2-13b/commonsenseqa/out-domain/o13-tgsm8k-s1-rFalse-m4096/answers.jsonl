I then used a method of counting the strings on each side of the character of the question mark and then counting the strings between it's number and the question mark, in order to figure out how many numbers. After that, I summed each string up and that would be the correct answer. If the numbers aren't formatted correctly, the solution will be out.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport re\n\ndef question_parser(text):\n    temp = re.findall('\\d+', text)\n    string_count = [0,0]\n    sum_value = 0\n    temp_1 = []\n    temp_2 = []\n    for i in temp:\n        string_count[0] = string_count[0]+1\n        #checks for the second half of the answer\n        if i[0] == '-':\n            string_count[1", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

I know it is very important when you are doing web development to have a proper flow. I've never been a visual guy but I'm working my way through my 3rd year and I was struggling. It just was not helping me to try and visualize the structure of my file system and where the different components were going to go. I've never made a website or used the command line before, so this was like learning a new language.\n\nThe problem is when you're first learning how to build a file system structure, where your project folders are going to go and how the pages are going to work. You use Google's Colab and learn to build your page structure. This can give you an idea not just of how it's going to look visually on your browser's inspect tools but how the code is going to talk to each other.\n\nAnother great tool that I like to use right now that has helped me is [WebsiteGarden](https://www.website-garden.com/en/en/), you can drop and drag different code pieces into the main workplace and edit them there, which takes away a lot of headaches that come with visual studio, which only lets you modify stuff for that one project.\n\nI'm going to write about my solution to the questions in the next tab over.\n\n## My Solution:\n\n### Step One:\nStart out by creating a new folder and placing the entire file structure in that location.\n\nCreate a new.html file:\n```\n//create a new one\n<html>\n<body>\n<p>My First Project!\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n// add in a title\n```\n\n### Step Two:\nOnce you get an idea of how the directory structure works, the next challenge is to get your project's contents loaded up and run them properly?\n\n\nI've made this document so that anyone else with an idea or two can start and learn from it.

Find the probability that the other two bags will both be from onion rings.\n\nSo right away I see that if all three bags were from one bag then there would be only 6 left over bags, three from one package, three from the other.

All you need to do is add numbers.  Read the question carefully before you start.  \n* The last question is a bit different.  Look for clues in the wording of the problem.  For example, the first part of the question has a word problem where you are subtracting money.  Don't always rush to answer the word problems first, it is a trick question!\n* The solution to the first few questions may not be listed out in numerical order, so we'll need to rearrange them a bit.\n* Make sure you double check your answer with the solution.\n\n### HINT 2:\n\n* A common concept to memorize is that the answer will most likely be a percentage of the value of the  question(s) asked.  Try factoring the  answer into a percentage.\n* Question 14 is not a typical problem, but can be answered via percentage.  Note that it does not involve percentages, it involves a ratio.\n\n### SOLUTION\n\n\nFirst Problem:\n\n* Mary had 89 - 3 - 7 = 79 stickers\n* Mary has remaining stickers = 79 - 44 = 35\n\nSecond Problem:\n\n* How much money does Zach need to save before he can buy the new bike = $100 - $5 = $95", "answer": "B: table"}

{"idx": 996, "text": "D\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below. Please provide the explanation as well. Use complete sentences.\nThe first ten multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60. Suppose the nth triplet is defined by adding the first two triplets to get the third triplet (like 12 + 42 = 54). You can see that (6 + 12 + 18) = (60 + 3), so 60 is the third term. Write out the next ten triplets and find how far you have to go to find the 100th pair.\n\n### Solution:\n\n# Output:\n\nThe first ten multipls of 6 are 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, 216, 252, 288, 324, and 360. This means I can take the previous number (for ex: 13) and then add my current number (36) to get the next number. Then I can keep going: 13 + 36 = 49, 49 + 36 =85, 85 + 36 =121, 121 + 36 =58. And so on.\n\nSo since 121 +36 =58 and since they occur in groups of 3 the first group of 8 times I've added 36 I get 58, and then the 10th multiplication is 1,080, so 10 times 36 is 360 not 1080 (as one would expect with the triplet formula), so 1,087 is not a multiple of 6. My answer is that I would have to multiply 6 times 58 times to get to 100th multiple of 6.", "answer": "D: skill"}

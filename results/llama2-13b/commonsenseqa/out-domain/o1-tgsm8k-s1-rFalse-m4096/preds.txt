The answer is to be found within the question.<n><n>In case (C) the solution to Ann's situation would be not to drop the pencil in the first place. Thus, the assumption is that Ann did drop the pencil.<n><n>For case (A) we can consider the pencil dropping to be an effect of her hand slipping or some other cause. We know what happened.<n><n>For case(D), we can consider the answer to be based on the question, "why does Ann's situation require an assumption?" But there is no basis for an assumption other than the fact that, by implication, we have been told that the woman got injured.<n><n>This leaves (B), the implication. When we say that there is an implication,<n><n>we make a statement that follows as a result of the first statement.<n><n>In this case, Ann dropped a pencil which cut the woman, thus the woman got injured as a result of Anne dropping<n><n>her pencil.

Their new promotions are designed to draw in more customers by giving them deals on the items that they are selling that include their best chocolates. The campaign is called: 'Candy for $1.99'. The deal is simple: Customers can pick any one of the following candies for $1.95: 2 chocolates, 5 lollipops, 7 gummies, 9 gobstoppers, or 12 jelly beans.<n><n>To promote this deal, they have decided to offer a special promotion. If you come to Fly by Candy today, on the first day of the promotion, and pick a special treat; you will also win candy of that type. For example, if you come to Fly by candy today and choose one of the chocolates, you will also get a chocolate.<n><n>How many Fly by Candy customers will receive a special treat today?<n><n>#### Answer: To answer this problem, we could simply apply the rules to every day until the deal ends.

The 2nd part has you finding the letter in the end, which is given by 3 different choices. All the choices have the letter in them.<n><n>**Question A**<n><n>We're given a number of stickers and Mary uses different amounts on multiple pages throughout  the journal. Since it asks for the "remaining" stickers that Mary has, we can simply set up a 4 column equation, but first we need to identify the "remaining" as 2 of the unknown values we're filling in. Let's name A as the sticker value per individual page and B as the sticker value for the front page since it's larger. Thus we're looking to fill in A and B with the rest remaining, so we can name these as C and D. We know that 7 and 6 stickers were on the other pages, so we can set up an equation and fill in as necessary.<n><n>\ 1(89-3(89-3)) = 86-9 = 77<n> 86  = 77(A) + 5(B) + 4C + 3D + 2E<n>  13A + 10B = 77<n>   13/10(A) + 4/10(B)=17<n>   0.13(A) + 0.40(B) = 0.17<n>   13(10) + 4(10)= 27 - 0.17 = 26.83<n>   A =  26.83 / 13 = 2.05 or 2 and 5/6 stickers<n>   26.83-2*5/6 = 44<n>

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:He made another call, he did this all day hoping people would what well to his offer? Choices:  A: hang up B: respond C: contact D: answer E: attracting ducks<n>Output:		None of these options are correct.<n><n>Input: "This is some sample text for the problem!

Choices:  A. respond B. attracting<n>dolphins C. he didn't D. answer E. attracting ducks<n><n>Output:None of these options are correct<n><n>Input: "She wanted to get home early, so she wanted what". Choice 1: get home.<n>Choice 2: a drink. Choice 3. more money.  Output A. Choice 1 and Choice 2<n><n>Output: "She wanted to do well on the test, so she wanted to get home early and<n>get a drink."<n><n>-What's the problem here?<n><n>-Are there any rules here?<n><n>-If I get some hints, How can I solve it?<n><n>-In the problem there are some sentences. Is there a rule there?<n><n>### Answer to Instruction:Solving multiple choice questions require: reading the sentence in the problem and try to catch any rules. As in examples A and C, there are two sentences about a person and we have to find a part of those sentences and then choose a word to complete that part of sentences. The rule that I can find is “to do” that has its object “what” and “to get” that has its object either “early, home and a drink".<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>1) Firstly read the sentences that there is a problem. In this example, I read the two following sentences:<n><n>A. He made another call, he **did this all day** hoping people would what well<n>to his offer?<n><n>B. She wanted to do well on **the test**, so she wanted to **get home early** and **get a drink**.<n><n>2) Then in A sentence, in “did this all day” we can figureout that there is something happen to him during “this all day” and it follows that it **hoping people would what well** to his offer, so we can conclude that it is the action called “hope”. The second sentence also like like that. In “to get home early” and “to get a drink” the action happened to the answer that we seek. **They are the rule**.<n><n>3) Lastly, the

Choices:  A: wage war B: fight enemy C: kill D: destroy enemy E: attacked his country<n>Output:		wage war<n><n>'''<n>- I did this on the fly. There was no time to do anything in regards to this. It is the way it is and its hard to even fix this later.<n>- The issue lies partially in the fact that as stated earlier, it is important to know which of the 10 test questions asked that have more than one choice. Those are the two that I had problem with.<n>- My code for this is in the main.py file.<n>- It reads as follows:<n>    - question_39 = [" Mary had 89 ", " 3 3 7 9 ", " 6 ", " stickers.She ", " 3 ", " 7 9 6 ", " 6 ", ]<n>    - choice_1 = ["on ", "the ", " of ", " the ", " her ", " her ", " 3 ", ]<n>    - final_code = [j for i in xrange(0, len(question_39)) for s1 in choice_1 for j in question_39]<n>    - print(final_code[0])<n>'''<n><n>Answer: Yes!<n><n>Comment: Yes, that did it.<n><n>Answer: If you want, you're welcome to continue to develop your solution. To the extent you are comfortable, I would suggest you look at these other techniques:<n><n>a) You're already doing a for-loop, but this code would also benefit from a try-except block to deal with any of the errors that you might be generating.<n><n>b) When you read files: either open/close, or use with the "with open as blah", or use the "read()" method on a given string. Note: When you write the answer to multiple questions at once for submission, I would recommend keeping one type of syntax consistent.<n><n>c) When you deal with strings (for example, printing a string, or adding a string to a list), use the "".join method, either directly on a list or in a for loop.<n><n>d) Use a regular expression to check for a " and " at each end of the line, when you pull the data in from the file. I would also suggest splitting the data in different ways when you do that.<n><n>e) Look into using a module like re to do the regular expressions rather than coding those yourself.<n><n>f) Also

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.

Still, he would have preferred it if the job were what? Choices:  A: present B: stay here C: closer D: available E: come here<n>Output:		B<n><n>Explanation: This question is asking you to determine which of the five choices is the most suitable replacement for in the blank.  The answer is B because, while the other options are not necessarily incorrect, they are more specific and the word 'prefer' suggests more than a singular choice (though, of course, there can only be one correct choice).<n><n>Input:"Our company has a plan, but we also have a product.  The product of the company, and the plan."  Choices:  A. the service B. the product C. the staff D. the company E. the manager<n>Output: D.<n><n>Explanation:"This question asks you to identify a word which can be placed into the blank without changing the meaning of the sentence.  The word 'the' cannot refer to 'company' because the sentence is stating that it is the company's product and it is not, in fact, a company.  The word'staff' can't refer to the product because a company's staff is its employees, not the physical objects it produces.  Additionally, a company is not a plan.  Of the remaining options, both 'the service' and 'the company' fit into the sentence.  'The product' fits in slightly better, which is why it is the most suitable answer.<n>

To understand English well, one should use as many of these tools as possible.<n>There are many mobile applications available in app stores such as Google Play (Android) and App Store (Apple). These learning programs are specifically designed to improve your spoken and written English skill. Some of my favorites are Duolingo, B2U English, and Voxy.<n><n>There are many flash card creator tools available on the web.

This is because the prefix can actually be separated into two words, which are used to build the word’s suffix. So for example, we have AMAZING, MAGNIFICENT, and COLOSSAL, each with a different prefix.<n><n>Output: TRI-<n>What are the two prefixes for ‘tri’?<n>Output: 'TRI-' is made up of two words: a tri- that means three, together with an -s to form a plural, making 'TRI-s'.

Choices:  A: africa B: north pole C: roof D: canada E: surface of earth<n>Output:		D<n><n>Input: a,b,c<n>Output: a,c   NOT c,b<n><n>Input: "Hello world!"<n>Output: Hello world!<n><n>**What happens if you put a value of "x" where it's not expecting it?<n>- the program will throw a "Syntax Error"<n><n>### What is the primary benefit to using the 'eval' method instead of 'exec' for running code?<n><n>- If you run eval('...'), then you must be running a javascript program. This is beneficial if you have an eval command which looks like this eval(userInput + codeString). You can be sure that the "eval" will only eval the codeString without running javascript code.<n><n>## Problem Set 4, Question 5:<n><n>**What happens when x = new Date() is passed as a string to a function expecting the object?<n><n>- The execution of `=` does a type conversion on the arguments, so x will be coerced to a `"string"`. Type conversion always succeeds. The function is expecting an object, and so it will throw a TypeError.<n><n>## Problem #257:<n><n>**What is the output of the following code?<n><n>```javascript<n>var i = 0; var x = 10; var j;<n>function foo() {<n>  i = ++j + ++i;<n>  x = i + x;<n>}<n><n>foo();<n>foo();<n>foo() + x + i;<n>i, x, j;<n>```<n><n>The output is: 87<n><n>The 'i' values are 10, 11, and 12.<n><n>The 'x' values are 6, 6, and 5.<n><n>The 'j' value is 3.<n><n>The last two lines combine x, which now holds 6, and i, which now holds 12. Since the two values are both numbers, this addition produces the value of 87, which is then returned by the expression.<n><n>## Problem 258:<n><n>**What does 'this' inside a function refer to?<n><n>This is a reference to the current object inside which the function is called, or, if one isn’t given, to the function itself. A function can be invoked with the call or apply methods, as we’ve seen.

It is not a gerund. 'back and' would also sound like a gerund phrase but this cannot work with 'tally back' because of the different prepositions.<n><n>#### Answer C: here both 'back' and 'and' are nouns and can combine well.<n><n>#### Answer D: 'back' cannot modify 'tally' in this case. 'Tally' is an intransitive verb while 'back' is a noun and together they do not work semantically.<n>

If you have problems storing a number larger than the 64bits in a long variable, consider using BigInteger.<n><n>2. As this program loops, it will find a list of items as a long. For these numbers, the first item is the left most column. As an example, in our previous question, the first item is 3. The second item is the sum of 3 + 64 = 67. The third item is 9. If you are stuck consider drawing a tree with all the possible numbers until it loops. Then you can find the patterns.<n><n>3. For questions 12 and 13, you will be given input for a number n and a string word. Write a program that will replace the letter of the first n characters with the given string. E.g.<n><n>    Input:n = 2, word = "HOT"<n><n>    Output: HOTOT<n><n>    Input:  n = 3, word = "HELLO"<n>    Output: HELLOL<n>    Input:n <= 0, word = "F"<n>    Output: F<n><n>### Instructions:This program will convert a number from binary to hexadecimal (base 16).

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.

Choices:  A: glass of water B: build evenly C: garage D: carpenter's shop E: video game<n>Output:		D<n><n><n>Answer: Your example is unclear but it looks like your question asks for `D` because you are searching for the closest matching string from a list of choices while ignoring case. So what you did is write out a long list of choices and then write out a long list, one per line, of tests for each choice, even though there are only five choices. You are writing out tests for six choices.<n><n>If you have that many choices you write out a list of choices and then simply loop through the list checking each string for equality. If there are only five choices then just write the list of choices. You should also only write out the list of choices (and all other lists) once in a separate line or in a separate function. That avoids accidentally having multiple lists in one place due to errors when copying the test code.<n><n>If you use a list to hold the test cases, you can use the builtin `dict` function to turn the tests into a dict of the choice and the answer for each choice. You can then extract the answer from the dict by passing the choice to `get` (or `try:`). You can find an example in the code below.<n><n>Your example has multiple problems, which I fixed below. I also added a new test that is not in the original but is similar to those that were in the original.<n><n>\begin{code}<n>import random<n><n>def test_multiple_choice(self):<n>    random.shuffle(self.tests)<n>    choices = [choice[0] for choice in self.tests]<n>    for choice in choices:<n>        self.assertEqual(choice, self.choices[choice[0]])<n>    for choice in self.choices:<n>        self.choices.get(choice)<n>\end{code}<n><n>Here is the fixed example, and a new test added before the `test_multiple_choice`:<n><n>\begin{blockquote}<n><n>Input: Mary has 47 marbles.

What were the people in the area doing?"<n>Choices: <n><n><n>[4]<n>A: taking pictures <n>B: selling products<n>C: drinking<n>D: sleeping<n><n><n>Explanation: In the sentence, we want to locate the 'event' that happened, we will look towards the beginning of the sentence for a'verb' because events will usually follow the'verb'. Once we have found the verb, we will notice there are 3 objects after the verb (i.e., Earthquake, <n>middle, night) and we should identify the event happening last. So earthquake will be the correct answer.<n><n><n>##### b. "The Earthquake hit during the late hour in the night."<n><n>Explanation : In the sentence, we first want to identify the 'event' because the correct answer will usually follow the 'event.' After we have located the verb 'hit', the event is an [4]. We want to first identify the time in which the earthquake happened. Since night is mentioned, we can conclude it happened during night time since it was specifically mentioned.<n><n>###### c. "The earthquakes have happened many years previously already."<n><n>Explanations: In this part of the question, first we will look at the 'event' which is the earthquake.

Explain your answer.<n><n>Explanation:: This is an interrogative sentence so it will follow the standard structure of Interrogative sentences which is "Wh-word, verb, subject."<n><n>In this case, there is two wh-word 'which'(what) and ‘that'(what). ‘Which’ usually refers to a condition or result (a noun) while ‘

For instance, Japanese words that use the lettering 'ko' end with the letter う. However, Japanese words that use lettering 'ka' or 'kya' also use that last う in their sentence structure.<n><n>```<n>This is especially confusing in sentences where you are not sure of the person being written about; they may refer to the person as kore if you do not know if they are male or a female. For example, imagine that a mother was writing to you about how much she loves her son (the son being her only child). In this case, since you don't know if she was writing to you on the phone, you wouldn't know if you were supposed to use a の よ (no yo) particle instead of a を よ (o yo) particle. However, because the mother used その in the sentence, we can determine that she was referring to her son.<n>```<n><n>```<n>This shows that you can even replace one letter in a word with a different letter without changing how that word is written. Therefore, words for 'him' and 'her' in Japanese can have letters that look identical because they both end in the same letter.<n>```<n><n>### [Basic Korean](https://www.koreanbooks.org/basic_korean.html#sentence-5)<n><n>```<n>Input : 저는

Use your function to determine the number of operations in a given expression and report the result in an `integer` variable that is assigned to the variable `numops`; for example, you are given expression `30 - (-40),` where the `numops` variable for this example should be a number equal to `5.(addition,subtraction,multiplication,subtraction,addition)`. This may seem a bit tricky at first, but don't give up. Once you get a grasp of it, it's very exciting! This is more than just `+ and -`, it could potentially encompass all operations. The only thing you have to remember is to write everything as a `string` so that you can add it to an array that uses string syntax, even though you actually have the result of operations, not strings. Once you are finished, your function should look something like the following:<n><n>```java<n>function numberOfOperations(expression) {<n>   var numops = ""; //define numops and leave with value of a blank string<n>   for (var i = -2; i <= 2; i++) {<n>      var temp = expression[i];<n>      if (!temp.includes('-')) {<n>         temp = temp.replace('/', '');<n>         temp = temp[0];<n>         numops += temp;<n>      }<n>   };<n>   if (i[0] == '+') {<n>      numops = (temp[i] + numops);<n>   }<n>   if (i < 0) { //subtract or divide<n>      if (i!= 6) {<n>         numops = num

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:The department store is located in the Northwest USA.  Where might it be?

Choices: every saturday morning, twice a day, once a month, everyday.<n>Output: weekly<n><n># What would you use to filter a list like I've mentioned in the "Input:" examples? <n># In other words - what do you believe would be the most effective way to solve the question? <n># What code is appropriate to use?<n><n>Answer: The most effective way to solve this question is to start by breaking down the <n>input into a "dictionary object". A dictionary object is defined as "a data structure that associates data with other data, a collection of key-value pairs." The dictionary is constructed from the "key" that corresponds to a unique identifying value and the "value" that corresponds to any information you wish to place with that unique identifying value. The first step is to put each of your keywords into a hashmap that is called "keywords" (such as keywords['Mary'], keywords["stickers"], etc).<n><n><n>For additional information, I've included a website below:<n>http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/dictionary_object.html<n><n>Answer: The correct answer is: B. The output of the example is correct by the key word in question 1(Mary had) and the answer key in question 2 (is) and question 3(go). The other answer keys(new york, big city) are correct except for question 3(go) which will result in once a month, every day. I'm trying to use the following code but I'm having trouble with the order dictionary.<n><n>#keywords = {"Mary":"has","stickers":"for","journal":"on","day":"after" "a":a1, "b":"b","c":{"a":aa, "b":bb}, "d":d, "e":e}<n><n>#for i in range(0, len(keywords["a1"])): #checks key/values<n><n>for i in range(len(keywords["a"]) + 1): #starts at index zero<n>inputKey = input(words)<n>if inputKey == keyWords[i]:<n>    print (keyWords[i+1])<n>    break<n>if you input

For the first part of the riddle, you need to know the following formula for riding bikes in one-second periods:<n><n>##### The length of the father's route = The number of seconds the father spent riding 4m + The number of seconds the mother spent riding 48m<n><n>##### The rest of the formula comes into play in the riddle.<n><n>##### 4m + 6m = 10m<n>##### 48m + 72m = 120m<n>Hence you can see that in the time for the children to ride their bikes equaled twice the time for their respective trips. Therefore, you must divide 160m by 2, the product being 80m. This is the average length of the parents' legs, as specified in the riddle. But what has the answer have to do with the two-headed, fart sniffing cat?<n><n>##### You can view it as follows: 48m + (54m) = 1

However, as I know doing a good deed always makes us feel happy, I tried to motivate myself to fix the window. I woke up early on Tuesday morning and gathered the tools like nuts and bolts from one end of the room and brought them to the broken window. I did not want to disturb my sister who was sleeping, so I made a little more noise while opening the window. As a result, she did not wake up. Finally, I collected the broken pieces of glass and put them at a place and kept them aside. After that, I tried to fix the screws and nuts, but I was very much tensed thinking about my dad’s reaction when I did something wrong. I was so confused. After a short time I felt I couldn’t manage it and my mother helped me a lot. After my mother fixed the window, my younger sister woke up and saw what I was doing, saying; “What a job you two are doing! I wonder if we can take anything apart,” she said. I felt so embarrassed that I left the place inmediately and ran.<n><n>Question 1: What was the main idea of the passage?<n><n>A. The broken window of the house<n><n>B.

Each option has a letter, and when splitting on space and turning into strings the letters would also split on space. So then each item in the array is "a" " b" "c" etc. Then I added code to split the strings based on space and not split on space and then made a list of ints and combined the lists using the [+]. I tried splitting on space and converting to int, but this didn't work, I'm not sure why.<n><n>```<n>a = input()<n>a = list((a.split(' ')))<n>b = list(a)<n>c = list((b[0])[1:])<n>print(map(int, c))<n><n>### My Output:<n><n>Mary had 89 stickere.She used3large stickers on thefront p age of her j ou rnal and 7 stickers e ach to 6 other pagesof her journ.How m any stick ere does Mary have rem aning?<n>44<n>What did Jane Fei nger do after she had been applying for job forme wee ks with no call bac k,she kNEW she was qu alifi ed, so wha t did she feel?<n>Employ ment<n><n>## How to Improve this:<n><n>I am not as familiar with how to use the map, reduce, filter, and apply functions in Python as other tools in Python such as string operations, however feel like this will help me to know different ways of approaching a problem.<n><n>## Why is the map, reduce, apply, and filter useful?<n><n>The map function was useful to take a list and make it into a list of lists for each element in the input.  This is a different pattern for turning a list into a list of lists than I would use and I was able to see how the split function did not return a usable list element from what we entered and needed to turn it into a string to make an usable int.<n>

Choices:  A: make noise B: have tea C: make time D: make payments E: take time<n>Output:		B: have tea<n><n>##### Reason for the decision:<n>You asked about what happens at a bank which seems like a common activity people do daily. And of the choices, the correct answer (B) involves an activity one might do at a bank.<n><n>##### Note:<n>For each of the following instructions, follow the steps and try the example questions below it.<n>1. Think of a sentence for each of the following instructions:<n> * "You can eat food and drink water at a restaurant"<n> * "When you get hot, it is helpful to have some water."<n> * "The only thing you can have a lot of is good friends."<n> * "When you visit an old friend, you talk about old friendships."<n> * "You can play games with friends, and have fun." (optional: "I guess you're right. My family goes to the park.")<n> * "When you finish talking with your friend, it is good to have another good friend available."<n> * "The best friends are the ones who come back whenever it is good to have a friend around."<n>2. Think about the sentence I generated in the input above.<n>3. Write a script that asks me the sentence for the instruction and outputs the correct output. Your script can run multiple times. Try it and change it until it works for all the instructions (remember: I do not know the instructions).<n><n>##### How to use the code:<n>1. Copy this script and put it into a new Python file.<n>2. Run the example instructions above and get my response. What was my response?<n>3. Change the instructions so I ask you five different sentences. This should be the same number of sentences as you think of for each of the instructions.<n>4. I will generate a different sentence for each of the instructions and ask you which makes the most sense for the instruction. After you answer correctly five times, let's move on.<n>5. I'll ask you 12 questions again. But this time, I'll change the instructions so I ask three different sentences. You can answer three questions without changing the instructions.<n>6. If you would like, you can repeat this process as much as you'd like.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the previous multiple choice questions correctly.<n><n>Input from the user: What is something you do  at a bank?

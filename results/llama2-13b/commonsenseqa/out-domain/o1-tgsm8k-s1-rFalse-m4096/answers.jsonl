Which term best describes this outcome?\n\nChoices [A] an effect \n[B] an implication\n[C] a solution \n[D] an assumption\n\nOutput : D\n\n**Solution**. The answer is to be found within the question.\n\nIn case (C) the solution to Ann's situation would be not to drop the pencil in the first place. Thus, the assumption is that Ann did drop the pencil.\n\nFor case (A) we can consider the pencil dropping to be an effect of her hand slipping or some other cause. We know what happened.\n\nFor case(D), we can consider the answer to be based on the question, \"why does Ann's situation require an assumption?\" But there is no basis for an assumption other than the fact that, by implication, we have been told that the woman got injured.\n\nThis leaves (B), the implication. When we say that there is an implication,\n\nwe make a statement that follows as a result of the first statement.\n\nIn this case, Ann dropped a pencil which cut the woman, thus the woman got injured as a result of Anne dropping\n\nher pencil. The woman is the cause of the injuries in this case. Thus, the answer is: Assumption.\n\n## 14.

Their new promotions are designed to draw in more customers by giving them deals on the items that they are selling that include their best chocolates. The campaign is called: 'Candy for $1.99'. The deal is simple: Customers can pick any one of the following candies for $1.95: 2 chocolates, 5 lollipops, 7 gummies, 9 gobstoppers, or 12 jelly beans.\n\nTo promote this deal, they have decided to offer a special promotion.

Tomorrow, those who come in and purchase a gobstopper will receive 3 gobstoppers as a thank you with no other options. The next day the same rules apply.

The 2nd part has you finding the letter in the end, which is given by 3 different choices. All the choices have the letter in them.\n\n**Question A**\n\nWe're given a number of stickers and Mary uses different amounts on multiple pages throughout  the journal. Since it asks for the \"remaining\" stickers that Mary has, we can simply set up a 4 column equation, but first we need to identify the \"remaining\" as 2 of the unknown values we're filling in. Let's name A as the sticker value per individual page and B as the sticker value for the front page since it's larger. Thus we're looking to fill in A and B with the rest remaining, so we can name these as C and D. We know that 7 and 6 stickers were on the other pages, so we can set up an equation and fill in as necessary.\n\n\\ 1(89-3(89-3)) = 86-9 = 77\n 86  = 77(A) + 5(B) + 4C + 3D + 2E\n  13A + 10B = 77\n   13/10(A) + 4/10(B)=17\n   0.13(A) + 0.40(B) = 0.17\n   13(10) + 4(10)= 27 - 0.17 = 26.83\n   A =  26.83 / 13 = 2.05 or 2 and 5/6 stickers\n   26.83-2*5/6 = 44", "answer": "C: subordinate"}

Is there a rule there?\n\n### Answer to Instruction:Solving multiple choice questions require: reading the sentence in the problem and try to catch any rules. As in examples A and C, there are two sentences about a person and we have to find a part of those sentences and then choose a word to complete that part of sentences. The rule that I can find is \u201cto do\u201d that has its object \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cto get\u201d that has its object either \u201cearly, home and a drink\".\n\n### Solution:\n\n1) Firstly read the sentences that there is a problem. In this example, I read the two following sentences:\n\nA. He made another call, he **did this all day** hoping people would what well\nto his offer?\n\nB. She wanted to do well on **the test**, so she wanted to **get home early** and **get a drink**.\n\n2) Then in A sentence, in \u201cdid this all day\u201d we can figureout that there is something happen to him during \u201cthis all day\u201d and it follows that it **hoping people would what well** to his offer, so we can conclude that it is the action called \u201chope\u201d. The second sentence also like like that. In \u201cto get home early\u201d and \u201cto get a drink\u201d the action happened to the answer that we seek. **They are the rule**.\n\n3) Lastly, the", "answer": "B: respond"}

{"idx": 183, "text": "B\n\nExplanation: This question is asking you to determine which of the five choices is the most suitable replacement for in the blank.  The answer is B because, while the other options are not necessarily incorrect, they are more specific and the word 'prefer' suggests more than a singular choice (though, of course, there can only be one correct choice).\n\nInput:\"Our company has a plan, but we also have a product.  The product of the company, and the plan.\"  Choices:  A. the service B. the product C. the staff D. the company E. the manager\nOutput: D.\n\nExplanation:\"This question asks you to identify a word which can be placed into the blank without changing the meaning of the sentence.  The word 'the' cannot refer to 'company' because the sentence is stating that it is the company's product and it is not, in fact, a company.  The word'staff' can't refer to the product because a company's staff is its employees, not the physical objects it produces.  Additionally, a company is not a plan.  Of the remaining options, both 'the service' and 'the company' fit into the sentence.  'The product' fits in slightly better, which is why it is the most suitable answer.", "answer": "C: closer"}

The answer is not that simple because there is not a \"one fits all formula. The following are some general pointers which are useful enough.\n\n  * 1. Make use of technology and applications in smartphones\n  * 2. Use flash cards or audio visual media\n  * 3. Get to know native language speakers \n\nTechnology is a powerful tool that can take your learning to the next level.  With technology, the learning process becomes easier because one can watch a film with English audio or text subtitles, read an e-book with audio, or play a learning game. To understand English well, one should use as many of these tools as possible.\nThere are many mobile applications available in app stores such as Google Play (Android) and App Store (Apple). These learning programs are specifically designed to improve your spoken and written English skill. Some of my favorites are Duolingo, B2U English, and Voxy.\n\nThere are many flash card creator tools available on the web. If you feel like you have already studied most of the English, it's time to bring in flash cards for the final phase of mastering English.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe greatest motivation to speak a language comes from the interaction with the native speakers.

This is beneficial if you have an eval command which looks like this eval(userInput + codeString). You can be sure that the \"eval\" will only eval the codeString without running javascript code.\n\n## Problem Set 4, Question 5:\n\n**What happens when x = new Date() is passed as a string to a function expecting the object?\n\n- The execution of `=` does a type conversion on the arguments, so x will be coerced to a `\"string\"`. Type conversion always succeeds. The function is expecting an object, and so it will throw a TypeError.\n\n## Problem #257:\n\n**What is the output of the following code?\n\n```javascript\nvar i = 0; var x = 10; var j;\nfunction foo() {\n  i = ++j + ++i;\n  x = i + x;\n}\n\nfoo();\nfoo();\nfoo() + x + i;\ni, x, j;\n```\n\nThe output is: 87\n\nThe 'i' values are 10, 11, and 12.\n\nThe 'x' values are 6, 6, and 5.\n\nThe 'j' value is 3.\n\nThe last two lines combine x, which now holds 6, and i, which now holds 12. Since the two values are both numbers, this addition produces the value of 87, which is then returned by the expression.\n\n## Problem 258:\n\n**What does 'this' inside a function refer to?\n\nThis is a reference to the current object inside which the function is called, or, if one isn\u2019t given, to the function itself.

If you have problems storing a number larger than the 64bits in a long variable, consider using BigInteger.\n\n2. As this program loops, it will find a list of items as a long. For these numbers, the first item is the left most column. As an example, in our previous question, the first item is 3. The second item is the sum of 3 + 64 = 67. The third item is 9. If you are stuck consider drawing a tree with all the possible numbers until it loops. Then you can find the patterns.\n\n3. For questions 12 and 13, you will be given input for a number n and a string word. Write a program that will replace the letter of the first n characters with the given string. E.g.\n\n    Input:n = 2, word = \"HOT\"\n\n    Output: HOTOT\n\n    Input:  n = 3, word = \"HELLO\"\n    Output: HELLOL\n    Input:n <= 0, word = \"F\"\n    Output: F\n\n### Instructions:This program will convert a number from binary to hexadecimal (base 16). Your program should read a number from the user and store it into a long. Assume the input number is a positive integer and its value is less than 2^30 (or int). It will be in range where a long is sufficient.\n\nThe decimal representation of each successive digit is 12 times the value of the previous digit. In other words, the last digit is 4 times higher than the previous, which in turn is half the value of the next.\n\nFor example: Given n=6 we have the following", "answer": "E: engage"}

{"idx": 467, "text": "D\n\n\nAnswer: Your example is unclear but it looks like your question asks for `D` because you are searching for the closest matching string from a list of choices while ignoring case. So what you did is write out a long list of choices and then write out a long list, one per line, of tests for each choice, even though there are only five choices. You are writing out tests for six choices.\n\nIf you have that many choices you write out a list of choices and then simply loop through the list checking each string for equality. If there are only five choices then just write the list of choices. You should also only write out the list of choices (and all other lists) once in a separate line or in a separate function. That avoids accidentally having multiple lists in one place due to errors when copying the test code.\n\nIf you use a list to hold the test cases, you can use the builtin `dict` function to turn the tests into a dict of the choice and the answer for each choice. You can then extract the answer from the dict by passing the choice to `get` (or `try:`). You can find an example in the code below.\n\nYour example has multiple problems, which I fixed below. I also added a new test that is not in the original but is similar to those that were in the original.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport random\n\ndef test_multiple_choice(self):\n    random.shuffle(self.tests)\n    choices = [choice[0] for choice in self.tests]\n    for choice in choices:\n        self.assertEqual(choice, self.choices[choice[0]])\n    for choice in self.choices:\n        self.choices.get(choice)\n\\end{code}\n\nHere is the fixed example, and a new test added before the `test_multiple_choice`:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nInput: Mary has 47 marbles.

Choices:  a) synonym b) homonym c) antonym\nOutput: b\n`\n\nAnswer: Let's break it down into a simple steps to tackle it one by one (since this a MC quest):\n\nFor your first input, you have to first break it down into a list of strings to be able to iterate over it and output a number. Assuming it's in a file:\n\n\\begin{code}\ncontents = [\"Mary had 89 stickERS. she used 3 large stick\",\n            \"ers on the front page on her journal and 7 stic\",\n            \"kers on 6 other pages of he journal.  How many\",\n            \"stickers does Mary have remaining?\"]\n\\end{code}\n\nThen, you can use a for loop to iterate through it a get just the sticker number:\n\n\\begin}\nstickers = \"\".join(contents[0].split(\" \")[2:])\n\\end{code}(strips the \"stick\" to just get the number).\n\nThen you can break it down into parts, using regex to get the first and last sticker, then the remaining. It is better to use variables in your code in case you want to change things in the future.\n\n\\begin{pre}\n`num = re.match(r'\\d+',stickers).group()`\n\\end{pre}\n\nNow, you can just subtract `num` from `89` to get the remaining (and then return the string).\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nOutput: 45\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nFor the second question, you will still use a `for` loop but to break down the questions by index (0,1,2,3) since they only have 4 options. Doing so, you can get the letters for each option and check them against the letter you're inputting for the corresponding index:\n\nInput:If i wanted to see a lizARD in its natural habitat  but i do not speak spanish, where would i go? choices: a) uTAH B) SOUTH AMERICA C) NEW HAMPSHIRE D) JAPAN E)", "answer": "A: utah"}

What were the people in the area doing?\"\nChoices: \n\n\n[4]\nA: taking pictures \nB: selling products\nC: drinking\nD: sleeping\n\n\nExplanation: In the sentence, we want to locate the 'event' that happened, we will look towards the beginning of the sentence for a'verb' because events will usually follow the'verb'. Once we have found the verb, we will notice there are 3 objects after the verb (i.e., Earthquake, \nmiddle, night) and we should identify the event happening last. So earthquake will be the correct answer.\n\n\n##### b. \"The Earthquake hit during the late hour in the night.\"\n\nExplanation : In the sentence, we first want to identify the 'event' because the correct answer will usually follow the 'event.' After we have located the verb 'hit', the event is an [4]. We want to first identify the time in which the earthquake happened. Since night is mentioned, we can conclude it happened during night time since it was specifically mentioned.\n\n###### c. \"The earthquakes have happened many years previously already.\"\n\nExplanations: In this part of the question, first we will look at the 'event' which is the earthquake. Next, we want to look for a time period. The event happened previously, but it is not mentioned before or after years. This means it happened years previously.\n##### d. \"The Earthquakes that have occurred in the recent past years was more disastrous that what have happened previously.\" Explain your answer.\n\nExplanation:: This is an interrogative sentence so it will follow the standard structure of Interrogative sentences which is \"Wh-word, verb, subject.\"\n\nIn this case, there is two wh-word 'which'(what) and \u2018that'(what). \u2018Which\u2019 usually refers to a condition or result (a noun) while \u2018", "answer": "E: cure"}

He counted 388 trees around the property, but \nthere are no trees around the house at all where they go to take the mail out of the mailbox. When they count the trees between the house \nand the mailbox, there are 149 trees.\n\nQuestion: If Jason and his mother travel between the house and the mailbox in a straight line, at what distance are they from each tree? \nThis problem requires you to read the information provided.

For instance, Japanese words that use the lettering 'ko' end with the letter \u3046. However, Japanese words that use lettering 'ka' or 'kya' also use that last \u3046 in their sentence structure.\n\n```\nThis is especially confusing in sentences where you are not sure of the person being written about; they may refer to the person as kore if you do not know if they are male or a female. For example, imagine that a mother was writing to you about how much she loves her son (the son being her only child). In this case, since you don't know if she was writing to you on the phone, you wouldn't know if you were supposed to use a \u306e \u3088 (no yo) particle instead of a \u3092 \u3088 (o yo) particle. However, because the mother used \u305d\u306e in the sentence, we can determine that she was referring to her son.\n```\n\n```\nThis shows that you can even replace one letter in a word with a different letter without changing how that word is written. Therefore, words for 'him' and 'her' in Japanese can have letters that look identical because they both end in the same letter.\n```\n\n### [Basic Korean](https://www.koreanbooks.org/basic_korean.html#sentence-5)\n\n```\nInput : \uc800\ub294", "answer": "A: sailing vessel"}

Use your function to determine the number of operations in a given expression and report the result in an `integer` variable that is assigned to the variable `numops`; for example, you are given expression `30 - (-40),` where the `numops` variable for this example should be a number equal to `5.(addition,subtraction,multiplication,subtraction,addition)`. This may seem a bit tricky at first, but don't give up. Once you get a grasp of it, it's very exciting! This is more than just `+ and -`, it could potentially encompass all operations. The only thing you have to remember is to write everything as a `string` so that you can add it to an array that uses string syntax, even though you actually have the result of operations, not strings. Once you are finished, your function should look something like the following:\n\n```java\nfunction numberOfOperations(expression) {\n   var numops = \"\"; //define numops and leave with value of a blank string\n   for (var i = -2; i <= 2; i++) {\n      var temp = expression[i];\n      if (!temp.includes('-')) {\n         temp = temp.replace('/', '');\n         temp = temp[0];\n         numops += temp;\n      }\n   };\n   if (i[0] == '+') {\n      numops = (temp[i] + numops);\n   }\n   if (i < 0) { //subtract or divide\n      if (i!= 6) {\n         numops = num", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

However, as I know doing a good deed always makes us feel happy, I tried to motivate myself to fix the window. I woke up early on Tuesday morning and gathered the tools like nuts and bolts from one end of the room and brought them to the broken window. I did not want to disturb my sister who was sleeping, so I made a little more noise while opening the window. As a result, she did not wake up. Finally, I collected the broken pieces of glass and put them at a place and kept them aside. After that, I tried to fix the screws and nuts, but I was very much tensed thinking about my dad\u2019s reaction when I did something wrong. I was so confused. After a short time I felt I couldn\u2019t manage it and my mother helped me a lot. After my mother fixed the window, my younger sister woke up and saw what I was doing, saying; \u201cWhat a job you two are doing! I wonder if we can take anything apart,\u201d she said.

You can only count the people in one picture at a time. The pictures will be presented a day at a time, with today's picture on the left and yesterday's on the right. For each day you are to count the number of people visible on the field, in the picture of that particular day. In picture one, we see four people on the field.

If we make the assumption that 2+2  = 4, then a statement containing this assumption would be an \"assertion\". \nFor example if we \"assert\" that 1 + 1 = 7 then we can be confident that the statement is false. The statement is false because we *know* 1 + 1 is equal to 2 which does not equal 7. \n\nYour calculator output should not be based on an assumption like we had with 1 + 1 == 7.\nWe are going to use the assert function and statement to make sure your output is correct.\n\n1. What does an \"assertion\" do? \n\nUse python and the built in assert function to learn more about assertion. An assertion  is an assumption that is either true or false. It is used to test the correctness of your code.  In this assignment you will be assuming the correct output of your calculator.\n\nFor example: \n\n`assert 7 + 4 == 11` is an assertion that is a statement that asserts: 7 + 4 should equal 11, an integer. \n\nTry it: `assert 1 + 1  == 7` You should get an error message here explaining that the assertion is \"AssertionError: assert 1 + 1!= 7\". \n\n`assert '22954147'  == '12099876'` is another assertion.

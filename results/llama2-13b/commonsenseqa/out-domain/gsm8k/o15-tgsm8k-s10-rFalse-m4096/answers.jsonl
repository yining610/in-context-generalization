Choices: A. buffet B: cafeteria C: catering D: menu E: open,\nOutput: open\n\n\n\n## Solution:\nMy first approach was to find a dictionary of the most commonly used terms for each restaurant. Then I compared the results using [Levenshtein distance algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance). My assumption would have been that every restaurant chain would have a term that was common across all of their establishments. In other words, if I was searching for a term like \"burger\", \"cheese burger\", \"cake\", etc, I would have expected to find the same result everytime. However, that turned out to be false.\n\nI then decided that I would compare each term from the input string with each term in the dictionary, again using levenshtein distance. However, this yielded results as well that I wasn't satisfied with. At this point, I assumed I was approaching the problem incorrectly.\n\nI eventually realized that I was missing the point of the problem. The problem is asking you to create an intelligent enough bot to understand what users are asking.  Instead of trying to find a term from some list, I needed to search through the entirety of the menu to return the closest available result. This is an [euclidean nearest neighbor algorithm](https://enrichingsoftware.wordpress.com/2014/09/04/euclidean-nearest-neighbor/). I still needed the concept of a dictionary (a database for terms that are searched for), however, the terms that are searched for become more generic, like \"what\" and \"do", "answer": "E: menu"}

A: Paris B: Munich C: Rome D: None of the above\nOutput: D\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: You can't pass random arguments to a binary search.\n\nAnswer: This code might do the trick. We can modify your code a bit like:\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass Solution:\n  def solution(self, A: List[int]):\n    start, end = len(A), 0\n    # Binary search.\n    while(end <= start):\n      mid = (start + end) // 2\n      if(A[mid] == A[mid - 1] + A[mid] + A[mid + 1]):\n        return A[mid]\n      elif(A[mid] < A[mid - 3] + A[mid - 2] + A[mid]:\n            end = mid\n      else:\n        start += 1\n    return 0\n\\end{code}}\n\nHowever, I am not 100% certain this is correct. You should check if there's a solution using the regular recursive function, and comparing its speed with the above function.\n\nWe can also try the same logic on the recursive function:", "answer": "C: city"}

In this case what the problem is asking for is a multiple choice problem. What they're trying to do is try to get as many answers to the question that you can without answering them all wrong. So one thing you can do is make a list of answers such as answers that you would think about. Another thing that you can do is you can add a few words to the question and try to add like five or six answer options. Another thing that you could do is you could use the built-in helper function named choice. This will create a bunch of different random answers for you that will probably be valid answers. So if you wanted to do that, you can first import the built-in helper random choice from random. And now we've got the function randint. This function will generate a random integer value. So it's going to return an integer. Let's try 20. And now we have this really weird number generated and if you want to do that you can say print random choice. And so what the helper function does is it generates a list with random numbers in the list. And so what we want to do is we want to generate a list and then we want to pick the first one that is equal to 20. So let's go over the list and we can say for number in range. And now we want to actually filter the list so that we pick one that is equal to our input value. And so now we're filtering. So now we're looking for the one that is equal to and it was on the input value. So the first number in the list is the answer. So since the answer was 20 this is one of the answers that we should probably give to this problem. So you can add a for loop to iterate through. So it would be a for number in range of a hundred. And now we have a list of random numbers and the second number in this list", "answer": "C: store"}

C\n(A) AANSWER C\n(B) A\n(C) B\n(D) C\n(E) D\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: There are two separate problems in this question. The first is to find that `int` type value given a list of `float` type values. To achieve this, we simply create a list comprehension which turns each value into an int, then take the sum. (Since all inputs are non-negative integers, `sum(range(0, input-1))` will not underflow and will never yield a negative number)\n\nThe second problem is to take each answer and output an integer value. For this, `cast` each value to the appropriate type and use `format` to print with commas and a suffix of \"cents\" (there are other ways to do this, but this is probably the more readable and understandable approach for a beginner)\n\n\\begin{code}\nfor input, expected in input_pairs:\n    input = map(int, input)\n    expected = cast(int, expected)\n    print(expected.format())\n\\end{code},\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item A\n  (A) 512\n  (B) 1960\n  (C) 250\n  (D) 4080\n  (E) 864\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nFor this question, it is not immediately clear the correct answer or answer format. (It could be that answers are always \"512\" and a non-sensical output will suffice, that the output format changes (not likely, but possible), or that an answer must be determined somehow and provided as the correct output). I would recommend writing a test to check for the correct format.\n\n\\begin{pre}\n\nfor result, (input, expected) in zip", "answer": "A: selling out"}

The school is a coeducational institution with students in different grades K-12. For every grade, the teacher has given a minimum estimate of the number of cakes they will buy and the maximum number of cakes they\u2019ll buy. This will be inclusive of any extras, i.e. they will surely buy at least the minimum number of cakes, and could buy at most the maximum number of cake. Your goal is to sell cake boxes with exactly the number of cakes that the teachers estimate. Each box contains 8 cakes and costs $1.\nYou may assume each teacher buys the same number of boxes, and cake boxes are limited in size. Therefore, if a teacher estimates that they will buy at least N and up the 2N cakes, all cakes from that teacher\u2019s class will fit into a single box. You may sell 0 or more cakes to a class.\nYour solution will be given Cake Sales. For every test case, it should output a single positive integer, meaning the amount of cakes sold to that grade in that case.\n## Input Format:\nThe first line contains a single positive integer representing the number", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}

You give them to the cashier.  You pay the cashier, but you still have money. How much do you have?\nOutput: $0\n\n---\n## Solution:\nFor Question 1 and 6, we can use the formula P = x*y where P is the price for x kilograms of an item at y dollars or euros\nTo find the cost, we multiply the amount of kilograms that he bought with 12 to find the price per kilograms. We then multiply the number of kilograms with the price per kilogram to find the total cost.\nFor Question 2, we solve for x + 1/3x by cross multiplying and adding x and 1/3x to both sides. When we solve for x we find that x = 5. We then divide x by 3 and multiply it by 1 hour to find a total that is 4.\nFor Question 3, we look at the problem like a ratio. If the initial cost of fuel when he refills it is 200, then the number of gallons is 200/x with 200 on the left side and x on the right side. If we know that the price went up 20%, this means the new price of the fuel is 1.2x, because.2x is 20%. We then divide 1.2x by.2x and multiply by the denominator(x) to find that x = 8.\nFor Question 4, we look at it like a ratio.  We are looking to find x when 20% of the total number of goals accounts for 200 and we are given that the total number of goals with 2x = 300. We then solve for the number of goals each with person by cross multiplying and solving for x. x = 50\nFor Question 5, we look at the formula ounces = gallons x 13.3oz/gallon. We can find the overall amount of gallons by multiplying the ounces(56 gal) with 13.3. Then we would", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

If you haven't figured it out already, it's called \"binary\" search because it's only searching in half of the array twice.  To search the array, you just have to keep dividing the array in half until you find the result you're looking for.\n\nBinary search has a runtime of $O\\left({log_{2}n}\\right) $. This means the algorithm will run in (roughly) $\\log \\bigg(\\frac{n}{2}\\bigg) $ time. In our example, $log_2(n) = log_2 \\bigg(\\frac{100}{2}\\bigg) = 13$. Binary search will run in 13 iterations and this will be pretty much the best time we can expect.\n\nLet me just clearify what an iteration is: If you run your algorithm 10 times, it has ran 10 iterations.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Instruction:Click here to show code example</summary>\n\n```\nconst numb=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];\n```\n\nHow long does it take if we take a brute force approach? Well, if we were to find the answer in an array that has just one element, binary search would be faster, but let's find a more interesting case. Let's assume we have an array like the one below:\n\n```\nconst numbers=[13,24,35,21,42,91];\n```\n\nAnd let's say", "answer": "D: garage"}

Each answer is worth 1 point, therefore there is 1 answer choice for each question that is correct (all other answers yield a score of 0). \n\nIn addition, there will be a penalty for guessing as well. The number of answered questions that are incorrect will be penalized", "answer": "E: refrigerator"}

B: So the two parties have each stuck to its own stance that if the other's bills get to the Diet first, then there will never be any chance of changing the country's existing pacifist law.  C: This state of affairs, which could be called a national disgrace considering that every other democratic country has accepted the role of a fighting force in the international community, has its roots in historical paranoia. D: The problem really began with the LDP's 1950 Peace Preservation Law, which was intended to make sure Japan would never again be allowed to turn into a war-like nation like the one that had ravaged Asia just a few years before. E: Then the DPJ turned into a coalition government and then another and then another before it came to its present form.  F: These organizations, known in Japan as s\u014dshi-kai, usually started out as small neighborhood organizations to care for family members in times of need and then expanded into political entities. G: This became an important issue in the national election last year, when the DPJ did get the biggest share of the popular vote but the LDP got the largest number of seats in the Diet in the proportional voting system. H: It has been the political philosophy of the DPJ, which formed in the 1990s from various smaller opposition parties, never to put forward a revision of the Article 9 that Japan gave itself after the World War II.  I: The Japanese people, however, have always been ambivalent about the military and the two bills are at the core of the LDP's ambition to remake the defense posture of the most pacifist country in the world. J: The LDP wants to amend the constitution so that Japan can legally exercise a more active role in international conflicts, for example to help police nations around Japan even when a full-fledged war is not taking place, and also to maintain the Japan Self-Defense Forces and upgrade them to meet possible emergencies in the Asia-Pacific, a region with whom Japan trades more than half its", "answer": "B: shocked"}

Be sure that you understand what is being asked.\n- Think about what information is given in the problems and what can be derived from it.\n- Make sure to choose the most efficient way to compute your answer for each problem.\n  - For example, finding the value of two decimal numbers plus is better than finding the value of two fractional numbers, which may take more steps.\n- Take advantage of the built-in functions. For example, the floor function will automatically round to the nearest integer.\n- If you've computed the correct answer, and the answer you get does not match the answer on the test or when you submit code to the autograder, go back to the previous steps to see where you may have gone wrong.\n\n## 2-2: Tidy Your Code\n\n[Hint](https://github.com/peter-seemann/tidy): Use this package to make your code more legible.

We can use the loop to check different options for a single input. There are three types of Loops. \n#      (i)  For-Loop which is for checking only one input. (ii)  For-Else-Loop for checking two inputs. (iii)  For-If-Else Loop for checking multiple inputs. We can use the same condition or can use different conditions for different inputs in else clause. \n#\n# The For Loop: The for loop is used repeatedly for a given number of times.\n#         Example: for i in range(10) print(\"hello, World\")\n#                Note that the for loop works only when i reaches 1,2,3,\u2026\u2026.10.    \n#\n#  The For-Else-Loop: It is the short form of the If and else if statement to check multiple inputs. \n#         Example: X=1 or X=2 or X=3 or X=4\n#               Output: X=1, X=2, X=3, X=4\n#               \n#\n# The for-if-else Loop: Is a general form of the for loop.

I got bored and just used `round(abs(-12+12), digits=4)+0` to get the digits the OP wants (4 digits past the decimal point. You can see that it rounds off to 56 instead of 55.7996)\n\nComment: Your solution is correct, and I agree with you on how they formatted the answer, however my issue is on a basic level of how to start the question. Not able to figure out how to start these questions\n\nComment: I think the easiest way to start these is to think about how many of each thing that needs to be bought. In the first case, it says `3 kilograms of diced fruit at a store`. So I want 6 fruits? Also how do you think these questions are created? Someone who makes this kind of thing takes a bunch of input, output, question, answer, and puts it in the program. Now, you don't know the question, the input, or the expected answer. You only have the output. So you have to solve this equation for one variable using the others. When you do, it'll be the input.\n\nComment: This is your answer. You need 56 things. What would they be? My first thought was kilograms - so 56k (6*3+2*2). If you don't know what  to multiply by then make a list of things you could multiply by. Time: 3.6 * hours. 1 hour is 3600 seconds, so 3600 * 3.6 is 129600 seconds! So now, you'll want 1296 x 5. You need 1848 times of whatever that is. That would mean you want 1848 hours. 1848 divided by 7 days is 261!\n\nComment: Thank you for taking the time to explain this answer! I appreciate it a lot!", "answer": "A: curiosity"}

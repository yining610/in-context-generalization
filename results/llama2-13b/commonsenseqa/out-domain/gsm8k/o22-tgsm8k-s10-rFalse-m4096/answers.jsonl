{"idx": 378, "text": "D\n\nInput: I am sure you are aware that the reason for my resignation is that I can no longer in all good conscience participate in this abhorrent war we are waging in Iraq that is costing our nation so much in blood and treasure. I did not join this organization but was brought into it and the military in general because some of the best young people in this country were tricked into making a life decision they otherwise would not have chosen to make. I am not happy because I want nothing more than to continue serving my country and for the past few years I have given full-time volunteer support to the efforts fighting this unjust war in a variety of capacities. I have been doing my utmost in every way to fight the war on two fronts. I want nothing more than for the US to leave this foreigners land, mind it's own business, and take care of it's own internal issues. I could go on and on but I think you will see a pattern emerging in the comments I have made and that is the only point I wish to express at this time. My fellow soldiers are committing war crimes. The reason I do not like to talk about what I witnessed while on active duty is because I do not like talking about war. I do not like war and I hate war crimes. I do not want to go into the details of what I have witnessed in Iraq. Those details do not matter in the grand scheme of things. The atrocities that I witnessed were small, perhaps tiny even, compared to some of the atrocities that I had heard had been committed by American soldiers in Abu Ghraib. If one is given a choice between murder and rape, one should choose rape as a lesser crime. While witnessing, or should I say participating in war crimes, I saw a country that had the right to be treated with at least respect, if not dignity.

He put the salt in bags and put each meal in separate bags and found out that there was in extra 0.15g of salt.  When he did the experiment, on an average, he found out that 5 times out of the 10 meals that the extra amount of salt was 0.150g.  When he did a similar experiment on another cafe, he found out that the average amount of salt was half of what the first average was.  So now he knows the amount of salt in the two cafes as the first gives an average of 0.15 and the second caffe gives an average of 7.5.

{"idx": 486, "text": "E\n\n### Instruction:Answer the followings short answers, they were taken from a Coding Interview at a top company.\n\n 1. What language feature do you love that Python doesn't have?\n\nI disliked that Python does not feature compile time checking at all. It would be great to get a linter that checks for errors in your code and ensures that the code typechecks.\n\n 2. How does python differ from all other programming languages? Give an example.\n\nPython has many features that are completely new and unique to Python. Some of them are\n\nList comprehensions: [x for x in l if x%2 == 0 ] -> Filtering out even numbers from a list\nDunder all: x.__all__: Accesses all the variables in scope, even when it is not defined globally\nFunction Overloading with different input.\n3. What about Python makes it suitable for machine learning?\n\nPython is a scripting language that works on all platforms thus allowing quick machine learning experiments. It is well suited for machine learning because of its package libraries. The most popular Python package libraries are numpy, Pandas and sci-kit learn.\n4. Why do you use Python?\n\nI have previously worked on Matlab, Java, C/C++ programs and I still enjoy writing code in Matlab and C++. I like python because of its object oriented programming features. There is no syntax to learn. It is a high level language.\n5. What do you wish python had features for?\n\nPython is feature rich and does not have much to improve on. A python programmer can do anything except for real time, low level, low performance applications. It would be good if Python could support multithreading like in Java.

So, the correct answer choice is C\n\nThe second problem has a simple equation where all you have to do is solve for x. To find out how many hours Jhon spends at the gym a day, divide 3 hours by 1 hour which is 3/1=3. To find out how x hours a day there were to spend, multiply 4 by 3 which is 4*3=12. Finally, add it to the 12 o'clock which is 12+12=24. And to find out how many hours you are going to spend at gym overall, you multiply 4 by 24 which is 4*24=96. So, the correct choice is B.\n\nThe third problem is easier solved by algebra. You can start by calculating how much of an increase 20% was. If you multiply (100*20) you end up with 100*2. Which means the fuel price has gone up by $2. So, if the price was $200 and the fuel price went up by $2, then you get 202. So, the correct correct answer is E!\n\nThe fourth problem also uses algebra to solve. They didn't give you the exact amount each player scored which means you can assume they scored the same amount. If each player scored the same, then the total would be double the amount of the first player who scored, meaning that one player scored 30. So, the correct choices is D.\n\nThe fifth problem also uses algebra. If each day Tom drinks 32 fluid ounces of water, how many fluid ounces will", "answer": "D: sadness"}

So 9(nuts) + 5(dried fruit) = 56.\n##### Explanations:\nThe problem is asking for the number of hours that Johns spends at the gym per week, however it does not explain how many days of the week he goes to the gym. I will say that he goes for 3 days per week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and it takes him an hour to spend at the gym each day in each day. So 3 x (1 + 2/3) = 1.5h/day =.75h/day = 4 days = 4 hours.\n##### Expanations:\nThe problem gives a 20% incrementation to the fuel price. Therefore the incrementation goes from 20% extra to 20% more in cost. Fuel now costs $200 + 20% of $200 = $240.\n##### Examples:\nThe problem is saying that Stella and Twinkale need to fill a truck with a volume of 600 stone blocks, they work at a rate of 25 blocks per hour by each person. There for they will be working 4 hours at (25 x 2) = 50 blocks per hour, or 50 x 4 hours = 200. There is still 400 stone blocks not filled from the truck. If there is 6 people they need to fill 60 block per hour. Which then would result in 60 x 4 = 240.\nThe problem does not clarify how big the cups are. If the cups are 8oz, the 260oz of water will be:  2.5 cups water + 8.5 cups coffee = 11 cups of liquid.\nThe problem is saying every day Tom drinks 4 hours of water. So 4 cups for 4 days. However Tom drinks 8 hours of coffee per day. So 5 hours at 12oz or 60oz. 8 cups of coffee. 11 cups every day. Then 60 cu", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

This exercise does not require you to pass any arguments into the functions.\n\nIn the following code snippets, you can see mathematical expressions that must be applied:\n  \n  * Input: `((100/5)*4/2)+10`  \n  Output: `(4+2)*10`  \n    \n  * Input: `(2+3)*3/2+5`  \n  Output `2*(3/2)+5`  \n    \nUse your experience with expression evaluation to write the corresponding functions and apply them. Exercise caution with your operator precedence when writing the function. For example, `3+4*10` **is not the same** as `3+(4*10)`.\n\nThe expected output is shown for example mathematical expressions.\n\n### **Solution**\nThe solution can be found at:  https://github.com/awesometraining/solution_javascript_exercise_07.\n\n### Solution Instructor's Notes: \nYou do not need external libraries for this exercise.", "answer": "E: motel"}

Functions can also be called over and over, and only require 2 things from you, the function name and the list of parameters needed.\n\nA sample function:\n\n\\begin{code}\n//define the function\nfunction readFile(fileName, callback) {\n//do what the function is supposed to\n\n//once the function is done, call the function callback()\ncallback();\n\n} //end of the function\n//now call it\nreadFile(\"someFile.ext\", function() {\n//do something, after the function finishes\n});\n\\end{code\u00bb\n\nFunctions are a great way to keep your code well organized.", "answer": "C: pleasing"}

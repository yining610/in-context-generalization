However, this list of notes will help to have an idea of what steps to follow through.\n\n### Implementation steps \n\nTo build a Socratic system consists of the following steps:\n\n  1.  The dataset/test set to be used in training the model should be split up and arranged in the form of a list so that it's easier to access and load. This dataset should be divided in two groups; a training set that contains all the examples and a test set to validate that the results are correct.(if the test set is not correctly implemented the test set will contain the same examples)\n  2.  Build and train the model that will be used by the system to analyse the dataset and provide the correct output for each question. This model should be trained using the features described in this paper. \n  3.  After the model is trained, implement it in a user-friendly interface. The system can include different models for different formats of the questions. For instance, the system can have a model for the questions that involve images and another model for the ones that involve words. \n  4.  After the code is run, the training and evaluation should be validated.\n    \n\n### Data Representation\n\nOne of the important steps to successfully implement the Socratic system is to carefully decide which format best represents the dataset. This format depends on a couple of factors so, it is important to carefully evaluate these before implementing:\n\n  1.)    The most important factor to consider is the size of the dataset/corpus. If the dataset is small, it is more convenient to add it the entire text as a single column rather than creating different columns for each different", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

Please remember to check your answers and spellings.\n\nThe Raspberry Pirates are on the hunt for a treasure buried somewhere in the middle of the lake. The pirates\u2019 boat is anchored to an island on the north portion of the lake, and they see an S-shaped buoy on the southwest portion of the lake. The buoy is one-quarter the distance from the island to a small deserted island to the southeast. The Raspberry Pirates know that the treasure they seek is buried two-thirds the distance from the island straight to the deserted island. So, they reason that the center of the lake must be the best place to start their treasure hunt. Then the buoy would be one-quarter of the distance from the desert island to the center of the lake, and two-thirds the way from the island to the center of lake. So then the buoy would be on a line going straight to the center of the Lake since buoy could also be on a line straight to the center of lake as well. And the line is 85 miles long, so, the center of the lake is 85 miles from the island and 85 - 1/4 = 65.75 miles from the desert island.

See [How do I format my code blocks?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/22186/643706) for a guide. Make sure the code is readable.\n\nAnswer: I believe your problem is in the `data['result'].pop()`, it's the same for the `inputs['result'].pop()`, that line of code in both the `main()` and the `guess()` function should be after  `inputs['result].append(x)` instead of directly after `for x in inputs['answer']:`\n\nComment: Thanks for the help! I have now run the code, and it is still giving me incorrect responses. I have also fixed my code block to fit the guidelines of the site. Thank you!\n\nAnswer: I have tested your code with the given 19 input/output examples, and no problem has been detected. However, there are still some minor improvements that should be made:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Since there is a possibility of multiple correct answers, the program should record them as a list (even if it is a singleton list). Otherwise, a user can potentially enter `12` as an input while the answer could be `12` or `3`.\n\\item The function `guess(x, y)` should accept a string as the input. Otherwise, a user can input integers as inputs while it should only deal with strings.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nBased on these two points, the following changes were made:\n\\begin {itemize}\n\\item Replace the line\n\n\\begin{code}\nanswers = answer\n\\end{code", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

Choices: 13% A: 38 53% B: 40 55 C:41 39% D:28\nOutput: A\n```\n\n## Common patterns\n\nThe patterns that we found in the data are summarized in the the following.\n\n### Subset patterns\n\nAs shown in the pattern 1023 and 1016, if the first two numbers are not `0`, the last one is `0`. There are two exceptions. The first pattern is `0101` and second one is `0221`. We checked some subsets data. There is one other subset that also satisfies such a pattern: `0199`.\n\n### Repeating Patterns\n\nIt seems there are no `0`s between `2331` and `2338` and `2435` and `2440`. There are no `0` between `1620` and `1631`, `1801` and `1830`, `1830` and `1860` and `1910` and `1030`.\n\n#### A\n\nIt seems like the ones that have numbers before `21` in the subset all have `2`s followed by `0`s and vice versa. (As there are two exceptions to the first pattern mentioned above, this does not apply to `0101`)\n\n# ANSWER\n\nTo answer the question of the day, one would have to find each character's position within its alphanumeric character set, find the sum of all positions, divide it by the amount of characters the subset is.\n\nIn example, if the subset is \"102 110 781\", each character's position would be: 3 for `1` for `0`, and then multiplied by 3 since there are 3 of them in the series.

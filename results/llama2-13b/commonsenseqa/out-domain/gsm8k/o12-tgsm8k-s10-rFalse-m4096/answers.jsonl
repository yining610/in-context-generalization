Additionally, he spends a third of the time he spends warm-ups and doing cardio every day. How many hours does he go to the gym every week?`\n \n\n### Explanation\n\nThis math problem asks how much a person used to pay to refuel the tank of his plane before getting an extra gas tank to double the capacity of his fuel and how much he has to spend now to refuel his plane with a 20% increase in the cost of fuel.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe first need to figure out the cost of fuel before changing the capacity of the fuel tank to double and the cost of fuel has increased by 20%. Here, we can conclude that the cost of fuel before getting another tank was given as a fixed figure of $200 to fill up the fuel tank.\n\nWe can also conclude that the cost of the additional fuel tank may be equivalent to the cost of the new fuel that has been increased by 20% - the original cost of the fuel. Hence the number of times $200 is going to be multiplied by 1.2 after the addition of a tank of a fixed cost amount - $x.\n\nThe new cost of the fuel will be the old cost \\* 1.2x after adding up the new fuel tank.\n\nTherefore, the new cost of the fuel after adding the new tank will be 200 * 1.2x = $480.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport math\n\nnum1= float(input(\"Input: \"))\nnum2= float(input(\"Output: \"))\n\n\nprint (\"output\")\n\nprint( (num1*num2) )\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n# 34 B\n\n### Instruction:Answer the problem below.\n\nInput: Mia's pet goldfish eats 4-inch-long worms.

I will give an in-depth explanation of how we solve this challenge.  The first round of the challenge is the most simple.  Since the other competitors also had time to understand the problem, everyone answered this correctly.\n\nThe next round was a little bit more involved, but not difficult.  Again, since others also had the same time, everyone solved the second round.\n\nThe third round and the rest were pretty complicated, and we're all competing against time.  In this case, there may be multiple right answers, and we have to choose one of them.\n\nLet's go through this question in depth.  Let Nx be the number of widgets put inside the shipping box, and let Lx be the shipping length of the box.\n\nSince the width and height dimensions are fixed for all boxes, we take a derivative of the formula to find the critical length for this situation as:\n\nL'=4/15*(Nx^-1/2)\n\nSince we have a box that is 20 inches long and we want to store 301 widgets inside of it, we want to solve for L'x.", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

In this case, I used a recursive method for finding the answer for most of the questions. This was necessary because most of the questions would require me to calculate the answer after using some kind of logic to understand what the question was asking. For those questions in particular, I used a recursive function because it was just better suited for what I had planned to write (and there was only one test case for each question that was different, this allowed me to reuse the function I had written for the previous question). Here is the solution:\n\n```java\npublic class Question48 {\n\n    public static int findAverage(int arr[]) {\n\n        if(arr.length == 0) {\n            throw new NullPointerException(\"Cannot do arithmetic operations on empty array.\");\n        }\n\n        double sum = 0;\n\n        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {\n            sum += arr[i];\n        }\n\n//        System.out.println(\"Original array average: \" + (sum / arr.length));\n\n        double[] arrCopy = new double[arr.length];\n        for(int j=0; j<arr.length; j++) {\n            arrCopy[j] = arr[j];\n        }\n        \n        arrCopy = reverseArray(arrCopy);\n    \n        //System.out.println(Arrays.stream(arrCopy).sum());\n        \n        return (int)(arrCopy.length * arr[0]);\n    }\n\n    public static double[] reverseArray(double[] arr) {\n        \n        double[] rev = new double[arr[0]];\n        \n        for(int k=0; k<arr.length;", "answer": "B: big house"}

What is your favourite part in the passage?\n\nThe favourite part in this passage is the sentence \u201cShe does have the potential, but she is never going to achieve it.\u201d This sentence seems to be true to me. I know some people are very potential to be successful because of their intelligence and the ability to learn things quickly, but the truth is, most of them never achieve it. \n\n### Instructions:Complete the sentence by describing the meaning of the underlined word.\n\nThe underlined word in the sentence is \u201cappraisal \u201c. I think the meaning of the word \u201cappraisal\u201d here is evaluation, review or grading. \n### Instruction :Complete the sentence.\n\n1. In most companies you will get a pay raise after a ____.\n\nThe correct answer to this question is \u201cYearly or annually\u201d. I think it is reasonable because in most companies, pay raise is given in annually. \n\n#14\n\n### Instuctions:Complete the sentence.\n```\n\"How good was she today?\"\n\nI think the correct answer is A. The correct answer is \u201cshe wasn't good\u201d. This is because the passage stated \u201cThe problem is that she never really tried. She knew she could get the job done, but she was so ______ about it\u201d. The word \u201capathetic\u201d in this sentence means unimpressed or not taking interest. It seems that she does the job that she was assigned only with lack of interest. If you say the girl was \u201cOK\u201d, it means that even though she was not good, but she was also not bad. Therefore, it does not match the meaning provided in the passage. On the other hand, \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d which are used in B and D do not match the description in the passage.\n\n### Instructuions:Complete the sentence. \n```\n\"There's no reason for that.

{"idx": 583, "text": "Answer: B\n\nInput:Read the following passage for the next question.Scientists have discovered a way to clone human tissue using cloning from adult pig cells. It was thought to be impossible because the DNA molecule in the cell is the carrier of the genetic material. This discovery is a major breakthrough in research conducted to try to identify cures for a broad spectrum of genetic disorders.It is hoped that scientists soon will be able to create human tissue from human DNA, which will allow such things as growing a liver or kidney inside a laboratory for surgical transplantation.It was thought that an adult animal would have to be sacrificed so that the DNA molecule from the nucleus of an animal cell would be extracted and introduced into the DNA molecule of the nucleus of a cell from the body of a human being. This would theoretically lead to the development of a human clone, a biological duplicate of a living person.In fact, some scientists have used this process to produce human embryos, which they argue, is a less difficult stage to reproduce the human body cells they need for the experiment. The human DNA taken from embryos produces a human clone, which scientists hope they can then grow into an organ, say, a lung or heart, and later transplant into a recipient.It was generally thought that adult animal cells would contain DNA molecules that were too big for the nucleus of a human cell because the DNA molecules of human cells are much smaller. However, pig cells proved small enough to adapt the human DNA. In addition, the DNA molecules of many species of animals show certain similarities, which allow for the transfer from one species to another. Choices: A: It is hoped that scientists will soon be able to create human organs in laboratories. B: Scientists clone human tissue by taking it from the DNA of an adult animal cell.

Type C. maze in the search bar, which will show you a [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/12797001/math-186-final-review-flash-cards/) website that the answer is D. [maze]. Now we know what is the answer, find out the question!\n\nThe question is most likely `How many grams of sugar does 15 grans of salt dissolve in water?`.\n\nBy checking the question again, the answer is `9` which we don't need to do it by ourselves anymore because someone already did it at Quizlet(2nd choice in C, 9 in D)\n\nThis is how you solve questions like that.

{"idx": 841, "text": "D\n\n### Answering Questions\n\nThere are four classes involved with handling a question and submitting a response:  **Questions**, **ResponseBuilder**, **QuestionHandler**, and **ResponseHandler**\n\nThe **Question** class is responsible for handling the logic of a question.  **Question** inherits from **TriviaBase** and extends the logic of that class to handle all questions for a game.\n\nThe **ResponseBuilder** is responsible for creating a response for any given question.  There are 5 questions built into the project, but more can be added to the project with custom code to add the Question class to this **ResponseBuilder**.  Once the **ResponseBuilder** has created this **Question** and processed the question through a set of **ResponseProcessors**, it creates and returns the response.\n\n**QuestionHandler** processes the text input from the player and will trigger when the proper input is received for the most recent question provided by the **ResponseBuilder**.\n\nFinally, the **ResponseHandler** takes the response and parses it into an int or string (for the questions 1 through 4), a float value (for questions 5 and on), or a boolean (for question 6).\n\n### Question Class\n\nEvery question is an instance of the **Question** class.  For each question, text is stored in the questionText field.  For questions 1, 3, 4, and 6, the player enters their answer as text and this is handled by the **ResponseBuilder.ProcessInput(String input)** function.\n\nFor question 2, a player will enter either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and it will require a float value and will be handled by the **GetResult(Question question)** function.  For question 5, a player enters a numeric answer.\n\nFor the first 5 questions of the game, it will be necessary to change the **QuestionHandler** if the questions are updated.\n\n### ResponseBuilder Class\n\nThe **ResponseBuilders** class contains an inner class **GenericResponseBuilder** that handles all the processing of the responses.  **GenericResponseBuilder** uses the **ResponseProcessors** class to process its questions through a collection of function handlers.  The **ResponseProcessors** will take the input it received from the **Question** text and handle the following functions:", "answer": "C: ignorance"}

To convert the string to all numbers, use either regex or list comprehension\n\n\\begin{code}\n>>> s=\"10000\"\n>>> s=''.join([int(i)for i in s if i.isdigit()])\n4294967295\n>>> s=raw_input()\n'7n5J7984z4w33543h1026788'\n>>> s='7n5J7'.join([int(x) for x in s if x.isdigit()]) #this is how you check with regex\n7502644324\n>>> s='5e3J5F8a3w3556435h1E267891'\n>>> [int(x) for y in s for x in y if x.isdigit]\n[363250]\n\n>>> [int(_) for x in reversed(s) for _ in x if _.isdigit] #list comprehension\n[36350]\n\\end{code}\n\nNow to your question, you can apply the same to the given string and convert it to numbers. If you don't do the conversion to integers, the logic won't compute for your 20% solution\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item `'200 20%'` would convert to `'200+20%'`\n  \\item `' 200 2%'` would convert to `'(200-2)%'`\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nso, the total number of goal scored by each player will be `int((200/100)*50)/2=30`\n\nAnd your answer will be `s=(30*600)/50`", "answer": "C: repair shop"}

Input questions are not supposed to be in single boldfaced format. They should be in number/word followed by the \"Output\" column, which is again in number/word format.\n\nAll questions should be answered correctly with Python, and the result should be a string of \"Output:\" + Your output number followed by + the right variable + \".\"\n\nFor example, if you were answering the very first question correctly with Python, and your output number is 56, your answer should appear as Output: 56.Nuts = 56, according to the formatting pattern laid out above.\n\nAnswer Questions 1-10. If you finish early, please check your spelling and answer them again(I don't mind if you redo them 50 times, really).

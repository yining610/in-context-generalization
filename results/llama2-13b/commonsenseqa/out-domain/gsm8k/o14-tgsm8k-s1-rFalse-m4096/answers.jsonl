A small coin always weighs `1 g` less than a certain coin `M`. A heavy coin always weighs 1 g more than another particular coin `H`. If a coin `M` or a coin `H` is taken away from the bag, the weight of these coins could be read by the weighing machine. There will be `n` different ways to make coins weigh. Which of the following equations must be true in these `n` different ways?\nChoices:  A only `n(H - M)M = L(H + M) = 2 g` B only `n(M + H) = L(M - H) = 2 g`. C Only `n(M - H)M = L(M + H) + L(H - M) = 2g` D `n(M - 2H) = 2L(M + H)` (The total weight of coins will be the sum of weights of coins `L` and the sum of weights of other coins `M` and `H` = 2L(H-M)+(0.5+L)(M+H)\nOutput: A\n##### Solution:\nExplanation:\nThe total weight could be read on the weighing machine and there is also `N` ways to put the coin into the bag.\nTo find the weight of `N` coins, if they're all the same size, we use weight of a single coin multiplied by `n`,\nbut since the question provides a range of different coins for the possible combinations and their weights,\nwe can use the following formula using the range:\n\n* `N(minimum - maximum) = 2(maximum + minimum)`\n\n### Solution:\nWe use the following", "answer": "D: clear"}

Choices:  A. they didn't fit B. they were on final sale C. they had a missing button D. they were made by the designer E: none of the above\nOutput: C\n\n#### What went wrong.\n\n\n## How to get the right answer:\n\n### 1. 89\n\nTo get this value, we have to look at the first paragraph. The question in the first sentence says: \"89 stickers. She used 6 large stickers on the 6 front pages of her journal and 6 stickers each to 10 other pages of her journal\". With this info we have to use the given values in the sentence and do some math as well. \n\nWhen we look at the \"6 large stickers\" we see we need to count the number of pages (89), the 6 pages the large stickers were used on (6) and the number of pages the other stickers cover (10). 6x89+6x6+10x6=984.  So we have to add 6 stickers per page to get the number of stickers on 10 pages.  But that means we don't have 100 stickers left after using 6 per page for 10 pages. We only have 56 left.  \n\n\nTo get the correct answer, we look at the second group of numbers, the first group being the large stickers.  There we see six pages that the small stickers were used on.  So that's 32 more, which leaves us with 88 stickers. But the sentence says large stickers were used 7 on each page.  That makes 6x7x6=144.  We can't see how that 144 gets added up somewhere, so we add that number to get to the 152 sticker count. So we go with: 89+152=241. \n\n### 2. 5\n\nTo get this one correct, you'll need a bit more mental agility. \n\nTo get this right you'll have to use math to get to the correct answer.", "answer": "A: desire"}

Please take the [tour](/tour) and read [about debugging](/help/answering-debugging-questions). Your error message is showing that you are mixing up spaces and tabs for the initial indentation of the body of your `main` function. Always use only whitespace (preferably spaces), or tabs, but not both.\n\nComment: Thanks, I solved my problem.\n\nAnswer: Your error message is a little misleading, it looks like the first issue is that you used tabs for indentation while using spaces in a previous line.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, make sure you don't mix tabs and spaces in the same file. And when you use tabs, do it consistently in all the places where you are using taps to indent a new line. In your case, you had mixed spaces with tabs in the previous line, which probably didn't break your terminal or your interpreter but was causing issues in the markdown output.\n\nThis can happen for several reasons, the easiest way to prevent it is to start using an IDE or text-editor that will show you tabs vs spaces.\n\nAnother thing you could do to try and see how to fix this is install a plugin for your terminal (or whatever you are using to run python), an example that works with powershell would be:", "answer": "C: red barn"}

And then using the list1 variable, the code runs through the list one by one and outputs it in the Terminal screen or on your text editor depending on the choice made by you, which is displayed in the print part of the code.\n\nAnd then we have stored the user choice list elements in a new list, which we are saving as a variable named var1, which is again stored in a new variable named var2. Then we have converted the variable var1 into an int function and we are storing it in the variable named tot1, which is 1st the summation of all the user answers in that list variable var2, and then we have subtracted it from the int function input1 and stored it as the tot2 variable. Then for the other answers of the user or user choice list variable var1, we have stored it in a new list named var3 and converted it into an int function and stored in in a total variable which summed up for the user's other choice of answers.\n\nThen we are comparing both tot1 and tot2 variables using the if and else logic in the if statement part, using the sum method, and depending on the value of the if statement logic answer, it returns the required output to the Terminal Screen using input string conversion and print function.\n\n```python\nquestion_string = input(\"Question : \")\nquestion_list = question_string.split()\nprint()\n\nfor x in question_split_list:\n    if question_list!= ''.strip():\n        print(", "answer": "C: backyard"}

{"idx": 768, "text": "B\n\n\nThe input values and expected outputs for the preceding questions can vary. The instructions do not tell a test taker to expect a particular example. Test questions with input-output pairs typically use real data, not hypothetical values. The purpose of real data is to make it clear to the test taker what the data is about. For example, consider the test taker's understanding of data:\n\n`\n\n\"I had an average of 79 on my tests this year. \"\n\n- The test taker would understand the data as an average of the test scores for a specified time period.\n\n`\n\nI had an average of seven dogs and eight cats this year. \n\n- The test maker would understand the data, because the test taker is giving a description that includes the number of dogs and cats.\n\n`\n\"I had average scores of 8 on my reading test this year and 94, which is nearly 10 times as much, on my math tests.\"\n\n- The test-taker would likely not understand the data because of its ambiguity, which test did the test maker mean and what did the test taker mean by the term \"nearly 10 times as many\"\n\n`\n\nThe real data in the given question can change in numerous ways. So, it is necessary to give the test-takers enough input-output pairs to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the data.

You have never written a program that solved arithmetic before? Even writing a program using a built-in language function is programming. You can, for example, write a program, using the built-in C library function \"fscanf()\" to read a line of input from a file. It would read a line at a time, scan it for any mathematical symbols (like \"$\"), and look for a number. It would give you the number in an integer variable. Then just use the C library functions for integer division etc. The built-in C library has functions needed to implement C programs.\n\nComment: It really doesn't make sense to write a program for this, though.

{"idx": 448, "text": "D\n\nExplanation: A yard is sometimes called a backyard, especially in North America/Canada.\nThe \"backyard\" of a house is where the outdoor space is behind the house, usually not visible from the front of the house - or accessible from it.\nIn most parts of the United States, at least half of the total area of a lot occupied by the house is normally expected to be in \"back yard\" status, including in many urban areas, suburban areas, and even some rural areas. So, the backyard is where you can mow the grass, play football with friends, hold a picnic, etc.\n\nFor example, in America, a house may be a modest bungalow on a narrow urban lot in a town or city, for which the entire yard is \"backyard\" status. Often it is only accessible from a rear, side, or garage \"door\" and this is normal. In cases such as this, the front yard may not exist, or be tiny.\n\nOn the other hand, in a suburban neighborhood, or a rural neighborhood, an average-sized lot (which is 8,800 square feet or larger) for example, it is possible for the house to be a large Victorian on more than one floor, with three or four bedrooms, an attic/loft for storage, and much more. A \"normal\" suburban lot will have room for a \"front yard\" that contains a walkway from the curb, room for a \"backyard\" that contains at least a large tree, a swingset, a pool, a shed, a garage, room for many cars to park, and other things. A suburban lot may also have a \"side yard\" that includes a sidewalk, the street, a driveway, etc. And a suburban neighbor may have an even larger \"backyard\" that includes a pond and several large trees. It is common for suburban backyards to be 5,000+ square feet.\n\nIn conclusion, the right choice for part of Question 15 is: D (property, a single house lot). Even in urban lots, a front yard may not exist.\n\nExplanation for Part 2:\n\n(a) If $x < 30 or $y < 35\nThen  $50 < 50", "answer": "C: city"}

She placed 9 large stickers on the left side of her journal and 4 small stickers to each of 9 other pages of her journal in the left column.\n### Output: 20\n### The answer is 20\n\n### This is a \"subtraction\" question.\n### The answer lies in the fact that there are 9 large stickers and 4 small stickerd on the left side of the journal. Therefore, there were 18 small stickers left. There were 89-18=71 stickerse left; however, the journal has an extra sticker on the right side of it, so the answer would be 70.\n### However, there is a mistake in this question, and this is probably a mistake in the original exam.\n### As the question asks about stickers _placed_ to the pages, it means the stickers are no longer available.\n### So, if there are 9 large and 4 small stickes left, they are placed on the pages, so there will be 0 and 0 left, respectively. So, the value would be 9+4=13, and there are 20 small left (71-54=17)\n\n\n# Question 2\n\n## What happened?\n\n#### Zach's father gave him an extra $15 on top of the $5 he gets in", "answer": "B: plane"}

It is difficult to understand someone you don't have anything in common with.  However, you don't have to be empathic to a person\u2019s feelings to understand them. You can understand a person by analyzing them.\n\nSecond, in order to understand the main character, we have to keep in mind that it was a different time of war. We have to understand how and why she felt the way she did. Just because they did things in the past, doesn't make them a bad person. We need to understand what was happening at that time and what she was thinking at the time. The story does a good job showing us her feelings and gives us enough information to help us analyze her actions.\n\nB.The author doesn't do a good job explaining the war or why it is happening.\n\nI think the author did a good job of helping us to understand the war. The book didn't do a good enough job explaining what happened and why. However, I don\u2019t think that the author could actually explain the war that well or it would not have been interesting. If the author just said this war was happening and left it to the reader to think about. then it would take the fun away from the story.\n\nC.I understand the book.\n\nAfter finishing this book I have a better understanding of war. I can now see how the innocent civilians who don't choose to go to war are just a victim of the country they live in. I can also now see how easy it is to lose yourself in traumatic times. I now understand how war and trauma can change your views on things.\n\nD.Sometimes", "answer": "E: office building"}

But at the same time, I've never been one to count my steps every day, but I do notice if I've done a more active day as opposed to a very inactive day.\"\n3.

My parents were hard-working, down -to-earth, everyday people. They hadn't even made it through high school and neither would I unless I got a scholarship. <n><h2>That was what I thought at the time, anyway. </h2><n>The next year I tried my hand at writing some short stories and was thrilled to see them published in a magazine for young fiction writers. I guess it hadn't much mattered _how_ humble my beginnings were - I was a writer, I was a "literary figure," I was on my way!<n>

A question like yours might just be unstructured because there's a lot of different things it could be about and there's no single thing you can easily identify and tag it as before you start processing. (Though this doesn't seem to be a case like that at all, you give enough examples in your question for someone to decide which class it belongs to. A different example like "how many birds in a flock" might be hard to pin down to any category though.)<n><n>Answer: This is a data science problem. There are many classification algorithms available. It's up to you to pick one and make it work. A neural network might be a good choice. Check [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/karthick338/Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning_using_Python_and_R) for some useful pointers.<n><n>Answer: If you want a good first step then I would suggest using an approach that looks for statistical patterns, such as words that are commonly used in one class than the others (a word that is used a lot in a class is a good indicator the question is about that

It can only help make interview prep easier on everyone.**<n><n>I would like to first talk about the programming problem, and then I'll discuss the algorithm problem.<n><n>My first instinct with the programming problem was that the test cases needed to be fixed - which should've been the first thing I did. But as I continued to look through them, I found a few more inconsistencies. For instance, you asked for the input on question 2 to be "$57" because the problem states:<n><n>> How many dollars did Freddie spend on New Years Eve?<n><n>I would assume dollar signs would be required but it's not.<n><n>However, once I fixed the input, I could solve questions 1 through 5. If you still find the same problem, feel free to use:<n>Input: 66,8,29<n>Output: 24<n><n>For the logic problem, I agree the questions are missing. I don't agree the sample answers are.<n><n>The sample answer you gave for the first question is a valid one. The only issue I see is that if the questions were missing, how would one answer them? As the interviewer, one wouldn't be able to give the candidate the answers. I guess you could add what information you have on the problem, and then they can use that to guess what questions you will ask. Either way, it's still the same problem without any questions.<n><n>The sample answers are good ways to start.<n><n>If we want to be completely technical, you can have the candidates create the questions. That way, every interview they will be given a different question every time. However, I've never seen this done. Instead, they look at sample test cases, and use those to generate the questions.<n>

However, some questions' answer choices required a student to subtract certain numbers. Other questions required students to answer by applying a fractional concept. In total, each question was given 5 different options for the answer. One of the options was correct, while 4 of them were incorrect.<n><n>### Relevance to Student Learning<n><n>This chapter was part of the [Study Guide for Math 114: Intermediate Algebra](http://www.math114studyguide.org/) created by the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.byu.edu/) at [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/). The students who took this quiz were primarily first-year university students who were enrolling in a college-level algebra course.<n><n>### Code Explanation<n><n>This code is the final version of that code, since the function I wrote is a quiz generator. The student can only take a quiz once, so it is important to change the code to a new quiz after the student took the quiz. This also requires that a function checks for this, and that it is rewritten each time the student submits a different answer to the same quiz. This means  that it is important for a function to check whether the new answer is unique. If it is not unique, then the function updates the question that was wrong to the current answer, and then it updates the answer that is correct to the current answer. The function then updates a flag that the student has already taken the quiz, and it allows the student to retake the quiz again, with a different question.<n><n>### Question Data<n><n>The data was all loaded using an Excel Sheet. The Excel Sheet lists the multiple-choice questions that the students need to answer. Each quiz has 10 questions. To check which questions were different

Now, the sum of numbers, what you are dealing with basically, is 2 numbers. In other words, Tapanga's candies is 29 and Corey's candies is probably 29. Add those two numbers, and the sum gives you 58. Now, that 8 is the number that tells us this difference. So, if they are 29 candies apart, this difference is gonna be 8 candies. So, when Tapanga has 37 candies, Corey is gonna have 29. And so, if you're adding them together, you get 66. So, if you have 58 candies from just these 2 numbers and you want to know how to figure out how many candies Tapanga has, that number 8 is the only difference between them. That 8 is the number you're looking for. And so, Corey is gong to have 29 candies. So, if the sum of 2 numbers is 58, and Tapanga has 58 plus 8 candies, that's 66. Remember this. If you are dealing with 2 numbers, and one plus the other equals the sum, the 2 numbers are gonna be the 2 numbers you're looking for to figure out. In other words, they would be 66 and 29.<n><n>'''

Why is this so? <n><n>##### Output: The spaceship landed on a planet filled with dolphins. The passenger is dead because the dolphins ate him.<n><n>##### Input #1: You are on a planet with only dolphins and the dolphins speak in a foreign language. There is a man who knows how to communicate with the dolphins. Also, there is a ship that you must repair before it flies away with only you on it.

He will reply "6" and the dolphins will interpret it as "thousand" and say a number, which is one of many numbers the man will hear. The man can then figure out the first 2 numbers the dolphins say are "5", and then figure out what the last number is by figuring out what number is being added to the remaining two numbers on the first question. For the second question, the man will then realize that the dolphins are answering in base 8, so if he sees 5-*-4-2 in the dolphin's translations, he will take away -4-2, and realize the dol

Choices:  A: book B: meeting C: television D: guide E: newspaper<n>Output:		E<n><n>Input:Sally, Janet, and Sue live next to each other and run a day care for children starting  at 5 am.  Sally runs the day care until 6 am, when Janet comes to relieve her. Sue comes at 7:55 to also relieve Janet until 10 am, when Sally returns.  Each day, the day care serves the same number of breakfast,  lunch, and snacks <n>but Sally serves them once or twice each.  The breakfast, lunch, and snack items  require 0.5 kg flour, 0.3 kg sugar, and 0.7 kg eggs per meal. There are a total of 235 daily <n>snack items.  The maximum amount of flour that Sally, Janet and Sue purchase each  day is 0.6 kg, 1 kg and 0.8 kg, respectively. Sally arrives with 0.2 kg flour,  -0.3 kg  sugar,  and 0.30 kg eggs. Janet has the same amount of flour but double the amount  of eggs that Sally does.  Sue has the same amount of sugar as Sally does, but her egg amount is two  thirds of Sally’s. Write an expression to find the number of meals that Sally runs by  herself, given the number of meals they run on that day.<n><n>Answer Explanation:The statement makes it clear that Sue does all the cooking when the total daily amount of flour is between 1 and 0.6 kg (flour + sugar) + eggs of at least 0. 3 kg.  However, Janet  only cooks when the total daily amount flour and eggs is 0.2 kg. Sally never cooks.  When the  daily total flour and eggs is not in this case, Sally runs breakfast, lunch, or snack, depending on  Sally's availability. We can also find out how many breakfasts  Sally runs by herself using the same method. Note: The case that the meals are  run by Janet or Sue can be determined by whether the number of breakfasts is 2/3 of Sally’s  day or 0. Note that, if the 3rd person is not

Since Tapanga has 66 candies and Corey has 8 more than Tapanga, then Corey will have to have 58 candies.<n><n>Explanation: In order to determine Corey's number of candies, we have to subtract the candy Tapanga has by his extra 8 candies and add 2 more candies to fill up to 66 candies. We get: 100 - 8 + 2 = 92. This means Corey has 58 candies, because his number of candies is equal to half the number he has (29), plus the difference between the half the number that Tapanga has (38). Hence, we come to the conclusion: 58 + 38 = 96, and Corey indeed has 58 candied because we round down.<n><n>The cost in dollars on Freddy's New Year's EVE calls is the international call's extra cost, which is 20 cents per minute, multiplied by the difference in time spent between calls to his father, which is 45 - 31 = 14 minutes, and then multiplying that number by the number of hours in a day, which is one. The total number of hours in a New Year's E've would be three.<n><n>(20 cents per minutes)*14 minutes) * 3 = 38.  <n><n>The number of hours that Lawrence worked daily is equal to the hours he worked each day multiplied by the number of days of the week.  <n><n>8*5.5 = 44 hours. <n><n>For Ali to sell all the books, he has to sell half of all of his books, so if Ali has 800 books altogether, he will sell 400 books. However because he only sold 60 books

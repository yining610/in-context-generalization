Choices:\n  A: Crop\n  B: Rotate\n  C: Scale\n  D: Zoom\n\n### Solution\n### Explanations:\n\n#### 1. Rotate:If an image is rotated, a horizontal flip is always applied to keep the image upright.Rotate is an affine transformation:\n\n#### 2. Scale:If you use the Scale tool, your photo will get bigger or smaller. By the way, if your image dimensions are different, there may be black borders that can be annoying and unnecessary. Use the Scale tool to scale your image accordingly.  (Scale is also an affine transformation.)\n\n#### 3. Zoom:If the zoom tool is selected, only the image will be zoomed, leaving the rest of the document in its original position.  (This is a non-affine transformation)\n\n#### 4. Crop:The Crop tool is used to cut some space out of the image, which is not the same as rotating, scaling, or flipping an image. The following images illustrate this.\n\n##### Question: When using the Crop tool to make a picture smaller, which of the following is not true?\n\n### \n \n \n  A: You will need to be able to drag the box to resize it\n  B: You can set the picture in your document with a solid white background\n  C: You only need to draw the solid lines that will be cropped\n\n###  Solution:C\n### Answer list:\n\n#### 4 \n#### 4  :You will need to be able drag the box to resize\n\n#### 3\n#### 3  :You can set the picture in\n\n#### 2\n#### 2  :You only need to draw the\n\n### Questions and An", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}

Use the following formula to find the cost of purchase\n`cost of purchase= [Price of nuts ($12) + Price of dried fruits ($8)  ]*3`\n\n   `= 48$`\n\n2.2. Let us consider hours as `X =1/3` of his weightlifting timetable\n\n`  = ` \n\n`X=1/[1+3*(1/3)] `\n\n`= 0.1875`\n\n` = 18.75 minutes per gym time.`\n\n    `24*18.75 = 450 minutes`\n\n`= 7.5 hours`\n\n3.3. Let us assume that prices as `P = 200` and\n\n`fuel capacity is 2X or 200%`\n\nThen we have,\n\n` [Costs of 2X fuel at [200+20%]*2] = 480 `\n\n\n\n## Reasoning:\n\nThe solution is using logic rather than maths.

What algorithm and steps do you imagine using? Does your implementation attempt to implement any more sophisticated algorithms?\n\nAnswer, Answering question and returning correct answer is probably one of the most simple and straightforward implementations. Mostly, it is a \"if else\" statement to check the choices. There might be some use of some tricks for a better implementation but nothing too complicated.\n\nThe main challenge of this implementation came down to the way the question was asked. I didn't realize the first question was so long! I could probably have done it a bit better now with the way I write the Answering question. For example, I might have put the question into the \"answering question\" function and made it all more clear.  So that would have looked something like this:\n```\nfunction Answer\n{\n\n    // put question in here\n    \n    return Choice.Equals(\"Output\")\n}\n```\n\nThe rest though seems mostly decent and the algorithm seems reasonable.\n\n# What is the hardest part of the algorithm? Can you show a pseudocode or UML diagram for it? Did your implementation do everything that pseudocode / UML diagram did? What was hard in your implementation?\n\nAnswering question turned out to be the easiest in the program because it mostly relied on reading the instructions,  but it turned out not to be so easy as I might have thought. This is because that if I wanted to keep the program as short as possible, I had to split the original question into several shorter ones which took more time. This also took some extra care to make sure the function did everything the instructions did.\n\n# Did you implement any \"clever tricks\" for answering? If you did, you might consider describing your trick in more detail so that the reader might be able to implement a similar approach.\nAnswering question was made \"easier\" by not having any extra tricks for answer. This would have been easier if I implemented some things differently. Like the actual questions. In hindsight there are some things that could have probably been better.\n\n### How well does your program answer the", "answer": "C: computer"}

The number of women in the trucking industry has grown at a faster rate than the number of men, said Ronnell Nolan, president of Women in Trucking, a female-driven trade group for the trucking industry. There are about 400,000 female truckers in a business of about 3.1 million drivers, according to the American Trucking Association.\nPrime Inc. is the largest employer of female truck drivers.\n\n\"We were one of the first companies to look at trying to figure out how to work through some of these gender issues,\" said Donna Hendricks, a human resources employee at Prime who works closely with women in its training program, called the Prime Student Trucking Development Academy.\nWomen make up about 10 percent of Prime's drivers, well above the national average.\nMs. Krachter's class at Prime is majority women, which", "answer": "E: get food"}

To make the challenge more efficient, the code should create the following structure as an example:\n````python\n\n\"\"\"Problem 1\"\"\"\n\"\"\"Problem 2\"\"\"\n\"\"\"etc\"\"\"\n\n### Solution:\nCreate a list of tuples corresponding to a list of text. Each tuple contains a question text and the correct answer. We also added numbers to distinguish each question. To make the code more readable later on, we choose `def` to wrap the question set.\n### Step 1: Importing necessary functions \n````python\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom statistics import mean\n```\n### Step 2: Import question data\nWe first parse the text data from the file. The questions are separated into parts by different lines. At the same time, the Counter instance uses the `defaultdict` function to default a value of `0` to `['Question', 'Answer']` if it does not exist in the text content. The counter instance uses the content as a key and uses the frequency of the word as its value. The value of `most_common` is a list that consists of key-value pairs that have the largest count value.\n### Step.3: Check the length of input question to output the message according to the result\nHere we use a series `of list comprehension` operations to generate `['Question']` and `['Answer']` according to whether the result is even or odd, then use the method `split` to obtain the Question and Answer respectively. We set `question = \" \".join(q)` and `answer = \" \".join(a)` to generate question and answer by joining every space in the list.\n### Step4: Display the question to the user\nUsing `input()` to display the question to the user and use `raw_input()` to take users input.\n### Step5: Calculate the number of \"Yes\" and \"No\" to generate the most common word\nWe use `most_common` to obtain the key and value. The number of \"Yes\" can be calculated through count `counter[\"Yes\"]`, same goes for", "answer": "B: pantry"}

Your question is too broad for our format, but we have a helpful guide [on asking good questions](/help/how-to-ask) you may like to read. I've edited some code tags in for you, but it would be helpful if you could [edit] your question to properly format the other input and output for us.\n\nComment: If you have another 1000 test cases, this is the wrong StackExchange site.

I was thinking that is was helpful to some degree because if I didn't copy and paste it, I'd have to type it all out, and I figured you'd see what the point was immediately if you read the other lines of the question.\n\nComment: Okay, I can give this a shot after I have a proper sleep, it is currently 1AM here, but i might as well give it a shot now, and see how far i can get.\n\nComment: I didn't quite realize the question would be this big, but no worries, take your time, it's pretty far along.\n\nAnswer: I would approach this by trying to make a code to parse each input into a data model. Then I would write a separate query for each set of questions. First, let's work on the data model. It should have a field for each question (eg: input, output), as well as a method for parsing each line into the relevant data.\n\nI'd start with a very basic model that reads a string and returns nothing, and progress from there.\nAn example of how to do that follows...\n\n\\section{Model}\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef __init__(my_self, input_string):\n    try:\n        split_words = input_string.split(\" \")\n        question_type = split_words[0]\n        question_desc = \"\"\n        input_params = []\n\n        if question_type == \"Instruction:Answer\":\n            question_desc = \"Answer the following multiple choice questions.\"\n            for word in split_words[1::]:\n                if \"?\" in word:\n                    i_params = word.split(\"?\")\n                else:\n                    iP = \"\"\n                input_params.append(iP)\n\n        my_self.question_type = question_type\n        my_self, question_", "answer": "A: sum"}

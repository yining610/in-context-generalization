The company\u2019s website traffic has spikes every morning in the morning and they want to design a method to crawl the URLs such that they could get a broad view of the content that is coming online each morning.\n\nThere are about 500,000 URLs, but only 500 are of interest to the company, since those URLs have the most traffic for their category of interest (e.g., technology, entertainment, etc\u2026). For any given URL, the company wants to make sure it crawls it at least 3 times in a single day. If the website is of a specific technology-oriented website, then there might be spikes in traffic on Thursdays at around 6 AM ET. If the website of interest is an entertainment website, then there might a spike in traffic on Sundays at 8 AM local time.\n\nThe URL crawling system needs to make sure that it crawls the URLs at most once per day, such that the company could get a view of the most recent content coming online for each website. The crawling order of the URLs cannot be random, otherwise the company might end up getting the same content each morning.\n\nWrite the pseudocode to find the earliest times each URL is crawled when the crawling starts at 6 AM ET and ends at 6:01 PM ET.\n\nA: 13142234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071727374757677787980\n\n\n### Instructions:This Challenge is", "answer": "D: outside"}

For n = 1, I took the next element to be 0 because I had no additional knowledge of the problem (since the first input has not been evaluated for the first guess). Similarly, for n = 3, I took the next input as -2, but this did not work.\n\nSo, I thought about a different approach.\n\nSuppose, we are able to find that if input is X, then the output is Y. Then, we can solve the problem for other inputs. Let us work out the example.\n\nInput 1: 89\n\nSolution: 0 -> 89 -> -2 -> 1 -> 0 -> -2 -> 3 -> 0\n\nSo if n = 3, the output will be -1.\n\nI decided to find a pattern in the list of integers. Then, I was able to find the following pattern 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> -1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 1 -> -5 -> 5.\n\nLet us denote this array as `X(n)` where `n` is the maximum length of the array.\n\nSuppose output for `input = k` is `output = l` which is the final entry in the X array.\n\nI have derived the following function for the pattern.\n\n![pattern](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eRX8s.png)\n\n`k - sum of X[r - 1], X[r + 1],...

Answer the following questions.\n\n####### Question1: List and explain some strategies to remember information better.\nThe two strategies that can help learner better to understand the material they are learning is to use technology, and learning using mind map.\n* Technology: For more example, use google chrome when learners are learning a language. They can find many useful sites to learn and many interesting contents. They may also be able to learn from YouTube and other sites that help learners to speak without any pressure of being graded. Learners that are visual learners might benefit from videos more because they are able to see people performing things and learners get more ideas on how to speak.\n* Learning using mind map/outline: Mind map is especially good for memorizing information because you can make up your own way of learning. A mind map can start with one topic, and branch off into different ones. In the middle, you can label topics by writing names in boxes. In the end, you can write a summary, and add a few points again for emphasis.\n####### Question 2: Why would you want to remember what you are learning, and how can you think critically when you are learning?\nAnswer: When learning you would want to remember what you learn because it will make your learning process easier. You know some examples of remembering is when I\u2019m learning about history in school, or when someone says we need to remember to buy the food at home. So when I learn or when I remember something, it will make my life easier.\nAnd, when learning I could think critically about what information is to important for me right now and what is not. Not all information is important, however, it is very important to know what is and what isn\u2019t.\n#######", "answer": "B: fun"}

For a programming job, you will be asked to code in a certain language, the basic concepts that everyone should know from that language, or related languages. Then, you will probably see a more in depth discussion on your resume and interview experience. It's better to highlight in depth knowledge on a language or toolset that you have used more.\n\nIf you're applying for an SAS job, you will mostly likely be working with more experienced SAS programmers and analysts. So, your ability to use SAS and how many tools you know in SAS will be more critical.

The first requires the kids to insert quotation marks in each of the ten sentences that need them. The second has words in all capital letters except the kids have added lower case letters to some of these words. The teacher must now figure out which capital letters should be deleted. The final quiz is a multiple choice test where the teacher is asked to delete the extra periods that have been inserted. In this puzzle, you can treat the sentences as a string of characters.

Each customer orders two kinds of bread and the manager offers the bread to the customer that is less popular and more popular.  If the most popular kind of bread is chosen by 75 people and the least popular kind 50 people, how do you choose the order in which the breads will be offered? Choices: \n\nA.

Offer the most popular breads in ascending order and the least popular in descending order.\n\nD.  Offer the least popular in ascending order and then follow with the most popular.\n\nOutput: C\n**Explanation:** \n\nLet's solve for the number of people who should choose each kind of bread:\n\nWe can see that the \"13 times more\" part of the statement tells us how much more of choice B there will be than of choice D. \n\nThen, we subtract 75 from 88 to solve for the number of customers who choose choice D: 88 \u2013 75 = 13 people.\n\nNow, we just have to figure out how to count the number of people who choose choice A.\n\nSuppose that 13 people choose choice A, what will happen with the remaining customers?  \nIf the remaining customers choose choice B in the same proportion as they chose choice D, we can add all together and get the final solution. Suppose that 1/3 of the remaining customers will choose option A, so we can add 13 to 85 to solve for the number 99.\n\nIn the end, 88 people choose choice B, and 99 choose choice A, so there is only 1 person left who will choose choice C.", "answer": "C: understand themselves"}

For now, we will explore solving some through different techniques for problems 1, 3, and 4.\n\nFor the first one we want to think the math behind what is going on and how it can be solved. We first ask how many stickers she had before, which was 89. The stickers were of different sizes, so first we must think how we can represent that in code. We might think about how we can use a variable for the different sizes she had. If we have a variable that holds 3, then when 3 is multiplied by 1, then times 25, what will be the result?\n\nAfter thinking about that, then the answer might be that the stickers that she used on the pages with bigger spaces, she used 3 times the number of stickers than the other pages did.\n\nFor the second problem, we want to think how we can model a variable that can store a decimal. To do that, we can use the double data type. Let's think of this number, which is the size of the allowance. We have to save that into a variable, so it can be represented as a variable, but that allowance must also be added to another variable, to let it represent what will be received by  the 2 hours that will come later.\n\nIt is interesting to note that because of how variables work, our variables can also hold other variables inside of it. This functionality will come handier later when we see a different problem.\n\n### The Output: 6\n\n\n\n### The Code:\n\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class App {\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tdouble allowance = 5;\n\t\tdouble allowMore = allowance + 10;\n\t\tdouble hours;\n\t\tdouble earn = 65;\n\t\tint legCount; \n\t\tdouble legCost = 2;\n\t\tdouble cookieCost= 1.25;\n\t\tfinal double score", "answer": "C: superior"}

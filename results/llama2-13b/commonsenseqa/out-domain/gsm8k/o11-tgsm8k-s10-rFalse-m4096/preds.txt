Please do not use bullet points.<n>Please write down about your understanding of the following:<n><n> - What is a class in Java?<n><n> - Does a class have to contain instance variables?<n><n> - How do you create instances of a class?<n><n> - When does a class get declared?<n><n>### Instructions: You have to read the following questions in order. In each question, you should assume that all variables used in the example are initialized at the current scope, and that the code is executed in the order presented. <n><n>Assume you have a String list containing 10 elements and want to replace each element of the list with the string "Hi!"  How many string copies will be created by doing that? Assume String is mutable.<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Assume you are storing an array inside a List (of ArrayList).  Now, you want to change the capacity of the ArrayList (with ArrayList.ensureCapacity(int), but it returns a new ArrayList.  Therefore, you have to create 2 new arrays, one for the list, and the other for the ArrayList.  How many object copies are being created in this case?  Assume a fresh Arraylist is created.<n>Answer: 2<n><n>Assume you create a list of String objects, and then store an object in it, and remove that object.  How many object references will still exist?  Why is that?<n>Answer: the removed object still exists because reference to it is still alive<n><n>Assume you're storing an ArrayList inside a HashMap.  Now, you want use Objects.equals(Object1, Object2) to check if the object stored in the ArrayList matches "something" inside your HashMap.  Because ArrayList is a class, not an interface, you cannot cast "something" to be a type of ArrayList.  If you make a deep copy of all data inside the ArrayList by calling copy.clone (), then "something" will be the same type as ArrayList, and you can cast "something" accordingly.  However, ArrayList does not have equals() defined.  What object copies do we need as a result of this?  Assume that the List will be populated with 10 items, and that the HashMap will need to store 10 elements as well.  In addition, assume each copy in

A person deposits little money in bank and withdraw money when they feel like that. Output: 4<n><n>Output: The two players scored an equal number, so it's the same fraction of the 300 goals: 1/15 = x/300. Because we know how many goals were scored (300 of 15, that is 20%), we can simplify that x/15 = (300 x 100)/15. (30000/15, that is, 2000). 20% of 2000 is 400. That is how much each of the two players score.<n><n>--- Part Six: Answer all questions (up to 40 minutes)<n>=============================================================================================================<n><n>Instruction: Choose a topic that you find interesting below and share your thoughts with us.<n><n>### Topic: Artificial Intelligence  <n>Input: Write a 5-line summary in your own words about artificial intelligence<n>Output: <n><n>```<n>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the technology that allows computer system or machines to imitate intelligent human behaviour.

We follow a simple process. In each trial, we pick a single member of the population at random and then give that name to him or her. To make things more interesting, the population's size is not known a priori. In fact, we don't even know how large the population will be. We only know that the number of population members assigned a particular name cannot exceed the size of the population. What is the name distribution of the size-biased populations? The distribution is:<n><n>- uniform<n>- a negative-binomial distribution with parameters p and 1/(k+1)<n>- a geometric distribution with parameters p/(1-p) and k (1<k<2p-1)<n>- a poisson distribution with parameter 1/(p-1)<k<2p<n><n><n>### Instructions:What is the probability distribution of a uniformly distributed random number?<n><n>Output: <n>Explanation: <n><n>- uniform <n>- geometric distribution with parameters p=1/2 and k=1<n>- negative binomial with parameters p=1 and k=1<n><n>### Instructon:Which is a negative binomial distribution?<n><n>Output: P(k = 4) = 0.05<n>Explanation:<n><n>The probability distribution of a negative binomial distribution with parameters p=0.25 and k=4.<n><n>Output: P (X > 5.5) = 0.64<n>Explanation: The probability distribution of a negative-binomial with parameters

Choices: 1: California 2: Ohio 3: Kansas 4: Texas<n>Output: 4 <n><n><n>### Answer:<n><n>To compute `how much did his purchase cost,` we need to find the cost of one kilogram of nuts and one kilogram of nuggets. To compute that, for nuts,  the output is `cost of 1 kilogram of nuts = cost of each unit of nuts * no. of nuts = (12/$) * 3 = 36`.<n><n>Similarly for fruits, the output is `cost 1 kilogram of dried fruits = cost of each unit fruits * no. of fruits = (8/$) * 2.5 = 20`.<n><n>So, to compute the total cost we have `total cost = 36 + 20 = 56`.<n><n>For problem 2, we are given that<n><n>John goes to the gym three times a week, but we don't know how long is the time for one day of lifting weights. So we can take `w1` = amount of time for one hour of gym and `w2` = time spent on warming up. Lets say `w1 = x` and `w2 = y`. <n><n>Now, consider that total time spent at gym is `t` and `x` hours spent on gym<n><n>and `1 - x *w1 = y * w2`.<n><n>For simplicity sake, lets set `1 - x * w1 = w2`<n><n>`1 - x = w2`<n>`y = 1 - x`<n><n>After using algebraic methods,we solve for `x` and `y`. Then, `t` = `3 * x` + `y`.<n><n>Since `x/3 + y/3 = 1`, the `t` = `(3 x+ 2y)/3 =` `4`.<n> <n>For problem 3:<n><n>First we find the rate of increase that was done to the price of fuel. So its `i = 20%`. Next,lets assume that the cost of fuel tank is `c`.<n><n>Then, for the new costs of fuel, we get `

Choices:  A: picnic basket B: wine press C: juice D: fruit cocktail E: kitchen<n>Output:		Fruit Cocktail<n><n>## Difficulty:Medium<n><n>### Question<n>You are a spy and you have to go into hostile territory. You have a certain amount of time to go into the enemy's territory and bring back either a codebook or a map. You plan your trip carefully and you arrive at the target but you encounter a big hedge. The hedge is so big that you either have to cross through it or you won't make it back in time. Since you don't know the size of the hedge, you decide to measure it.<n><n>Your friend gives you a 50-unit measuring stick and you discover that there are exactly 200 units total between the beginning and end of the hedge. You also find that the entire hedge is made up of 40 congruent parts.  You are able to tell that the hedge is made up 50-unit lengths (the 50-unit stick will give you 100 units each way).<n><n>How long are each part of the hedge?<n><n>### Solution Explanation<n><n>#### Solution:Let's start with the base unit of the hedge.  There are 200 units in the entire hedge.  We see that from the middle of the hedge to the end, there is 100 units.  So there are exactly 100 more units from the end of the hedge to where the hedge begins.  Since the hedge is 50 units long, there is exactly half the hedge at both ends. This means that the base unit is 25 units long.  Now we use the pigeonhole principle to find how many parts there are in the hedge.<n><n>We are given that the hedge is composed of "40 congruent units". This means that there can be exactly 40 unique parts.  Since this number is given, this means either that the hedge is already broken up into parts or that that number of parts can be made possible by the number of units given.<n><n>Since 200 is definitely a multiple of 50, this means that we can construct 40 congruently sized units (or parts) out of it.  And that means that there are exactly 40 parts in the hedge.  So this answer makes sense.

What if you had to output the value of 30 for that temperature range? How complicated would your code be?**<n><n>- A good way to approach this type of problem is to think in terms of creating a data structure, or a table, to store your  values from 0 to 50. And in this particular problem, the value in one column would indicate a true result whereas those in another column would result in a false condition. The condition could be "output true when temperature is between 0 and 32". Then you could simply ask if a value in a given list is a true condition, then output that value, otherwise return "false". Then, you could create a function to loop over your table of values, returning each value as its own output, where the table might have two columns. The code would look something like:<n><n>```<n>def fahrenheit_calculator(_degrees_celsius):<n>    # create list of (true/false) outcomes in separate list<n>    output = [True, False, True, False, etc]<n>    <n>    # find list in table<n>    for i, row in enumerate(_degrees_cellsus):<n>        # compare index in list for (true/false) condition<n>        if _de

We need to solve all the questions at the same time that we are trying to complete all the questions in the smallest possible time frame. How would we do that? The question is the following: if I am able to solve multiple problems simultaneously, will it be faster than trying to solve them sequentially? This is called "parallelism". Most modern computers are capable of running two or four different programs (instructions) simultaneously. If we are able to solve the problem by writing one instruction, then we have just solved the first question in parallel. Now we continue to write one instruction to perform the next question, then we have the third question solved in parallel. We are able to solve all the questions in the fastest possible way.<n><n>### How can we solve multiple choice questions at the same time if we can't solve all the questions simultaneously? To do that we need to have multiple ways of solving questions. The way we would solve multiple choice questions is by being able to solve them in different ways or multiple algorithms. Using multiple problem-solving methods makes it possible for us to solve multiple problems at the same time. This will help us to solve the questions at a faster time than solving questions sequentially.<n><n>### Now is time to look at each of the example questions and how we can solve it using multiple methods.<n><n>Example question #1:<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n><n>Input:There is a 15 feet by 20 feet room that must contain a square rug. How many different positions can the rug be placed in the room?<n>Output: 20<n>##### Solution:<n><n>### The most important thing here to do is write down the equation (equations are a great way to describe questions and be able to give you answers to multiple questions at the same time). The equation here is the total area of the room (150 ft) minus the total area of the rug (1 ft) and then divide that by the area of the rug.<n>$150-1=149$<n><n>### The formula we will actually use is:   $150 - x = 149$<n>Now is time to plug in 'x' to get the answer.<n>$165

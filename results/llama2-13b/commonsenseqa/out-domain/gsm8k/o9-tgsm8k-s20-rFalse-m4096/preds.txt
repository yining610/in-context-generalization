Choices: A: raced B: was going to have the best time C: had been watching all day D: raced fast E: was going to win<n>Output: C<n>Explanation: They are all verbs, except "had." You can't choose "had" because they already watched all day, so you cannot have "had." They also cannot be "was going to" because that implies they are going to do an action. They are then left with "raced, raced fast, and watched." "Raced fast" is an action, "had been watching" is not an action, and "raced" is an action. You can eliminate "had been watching" because we don't know when the action happens. It could be anytime. "Raced fast all day" is an action, we just don't know the timeframe in which it is done: the whole day, only in the morning, all day only at night, etc. The correct answer is "raced" because they are specifically at the track, and they are not doing the action the whole day. They will do it at multiple times during the day, but it is a specific time and place.<n><n>Input:You should eat carrots because they help you get _____. Choices: A1: good eyesight.

He searched and found a large menu of what? Choices:  A: advertisement B: news C: bar D: cafe E: internet sites<n>Output:		<n><n><n>#### Tips:<n><n>- You can use the String class from Python to store the user's input as strings. This will ensure that the input is stored as a proper sequence of characters, and not as a number or any other type of data.<n>- Always try to limit the length of the user's input to a reasonable length. This will help to keep the program within a reasonable timeframe and reduce the chance of runtime errors due to an overflowing stack or heap.<n>- Using `raw_input()` is more suitable for accepting user input in Python because it accepts input as a string rather than as a number or any binary data type. Raw input is generally safer than using a variable to store the input when working with user input in Python programs. However, it would still be better to perform proper validation and sanitization of the input.<n>- Using `print()` or `print()` can make the program more engaging and interactive. It will also make the process interactive.<n>- Using `if`-`elif` statements is a good choice when there is a single right answer and you want to minimize the number of checks. This is because it will reduce the number of branches that the program needs to check against. However, this can have the downside of increasing the cognitive load on the user.<n>- Try to use the `else` branch when you have multiple correct solutions, this can increase the cognitive load and make the program more difficult to understand. In some cases, it can be better to just have a single `if` statement that returns the answer. It will also provide the user with more structure to follow.<n><n>

Choices:  A: hardware store B: basement C: garage D: repair shop E: the library.<n>Output:		A<n><n><n>**Answer Explanation**<n><n>**Correct:** The correct answer is 'A', since the person went to the hardware store to get the tool. All of the other options are wrong because these locations are the wrong places where the person can find the tool.<n><n>Example: An article says 'Fred bought a new table and a new bed. Where has he been shopping? A. hardware store B. building materials store C. antique store.'<n><n>If you had to choose the correct answer for this question, would you find the answers easily?<n><n>**Hint:** In order to find the correct answer, try to determine the reason why an article asked the question at all. Try to understand what was the point of the question, where did the person shop, and the article wanted the reader to find out because the person bought a table and a bed. Therefore, the correct answer is 'B'.<n><n>In question a) the person did not mention that the candies of Tapanga and Core are different, so, when you find the common denominator, the denominator would be 66 and the numerator would be 9, giving you the answer 29.<n>The correct answer is 29<n><n>In question b) The information you receive from the question is a few facts about an international phone call and what the call cost. Knowing that the call came from Freddy, to dad and then to brother, and the information that the call totaled one dollar, you can easily determine how many phone calls were made that would result in a costs of one dollar. All the information you have is this table. <n>![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/8qeQh93.png "phone charge"). All you have to do is go from the beginning till you encounter a dollar.<n>``` 5 calls, 45 minutes<n>31 minutes <n>31 minutes 50 cents = 5 calls<n>  2 minutes <n>6 minutes 1 <n>----------------------------------       1 dollar```<n>So, the correct answer would be 'choice 5' because there are 5 phone calls in total. You have to count them till you reach a dollar in total. Once you reach a dollar, you stop and consider the option that would give you the greatest answer. Therefore, the value of the answer would be 'choice one'.

Choices:  A: drugstore B: hospital C: bedroom D: car E: house<n>Output:		C<n>  Explanation: A. Drug stores sell many different kinds of medicines.  B. A hospital sells different types of machines that help recover from sickness.  C. Bedrooms are the perfect place  where you would find a hairbrush and bandages.  D. Since a car is a form of transportation, we cannot think of it  as the correct choice.  E.

(9,10,11,12)<n>  *When you count the amount you have all together, you see that you have 60 coins, so now you have to double it to get a dollar. The amount of money you will have is 1.20. This is the answer. The best way to find the answer is 1.44 + 10 more than 1.20 = 1.44<n><n>Input:How long is 7 and 1/3 feet?<n>Output: 8.75<n>  Solution: 7 and 1 /3 feet is equivalent to 8 and 2/3 feet. This is because you added 1 and 1/3 to 7.<n>  *We have to convert feet to inches.<n>  *Take the foot (12 inches) and multiply it by 2 and a third.<n>  *Then, you get 25.2 inches. So now you are done with the conversion.<n>  *Now we can convert 8 feet and 2/3 of 12 inches to 1 inch in order to get 4 and 1/3.<n>  *So now you have 25.2 + 4.1 = 29.3.<n>  *Now you can convert all the inches into feet by taking the decimal place before the comma (.) and dividing it by

The key is that you need to solve the CTF like you would solve a puzzle<n>\begin{itemize}<n>\item The first question is asking what number is the most occurring in the file, so use a tool (grep usually) that will show you each unique value and how many times it occurs (which was 65!).<n>\item Using the answer to the first question, find out how many candy bars Corey has. We know he has 8 fewer than Tapanga, so we find out that Tapanga gets (65 - 8).  Now we find out how many bars Tapanaga has left (65 - 57). Then, we can say that Corey = (65 - 29).<n>\item You have given three choices, so we try each one of them. First, we go to the phone bill and find out that the first number is.45 cents. Then we go to the rest of the answer choices and try and find out what number is.25 cents. We find out very quickly that (31 *.25) does not equal 25 cents! Therefore, the answer must be the first one, which is 5 dollars.<n>\item The question is asking you what the hours must be for each day, so find out what the first and second number are (8 and 5.5). You then go to the rest of your choices to find out what the next logical number is (5). Since that number is the one that has the fewest number of hours per day, you pick that one.<n>\item First, you add together all the amounts of books sold per day, which equals (a total of 76). Then, the question asks you to find out the number of books that were not sold. Since 76 of them were, 600 of them were not.<n>\item Since each birdhouse is

The question can be represented this way: Let the number of candies Corey have be x, then the number of candies Tapanga have will be ( x + 8 ). From there, subtract 66 both sides.<n><n>######   2.) This can be solved with the following equation:<n><n>###### 3.) This is an easy question. Tapanga worked Monday, Tuesday & Friday for 8h each day. He worked Wed for 5.5h and Thu for 5.5 as well. If he worked the equal hours each day, his working will be : 2x + 8 = 40. x = 15<n><n>###### 4.) The problem can be formulated as follows :<n>###### 5.) The solution for this question can be represented with the following equation: Let the initial stock of Ali be x. At the end of the week, the stock left will be (x - (60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66)) = x - 230<n><n>###### 6.) Since each birdhouse costs a fixed price, the sum of selling price will be equal to the sum of their cost, which means: <n>###### 7.) Since the number of puppies are divisible by 4, it must be a multiple of 4, so the answer will be 50 puppies. <n>###### 8.) For simplicity sake let's say there are 2 boxes of cereals, and each one contains x and y ounces of cerea, respectively. Also, the amount of third box will be x - y. Then, the amount of cereal in each of the 3 boxes will be (x + y + x - y) = 4x. As desired, the total amount of cereal will be 40*(x + y + x-y) = x + 2y + x - 3y = 3x<n><n>###### 9.) Let the amount of gallons of water in all 3 carts be x gallons. Then

Choices:  A: shopping mall B: hospitals C: populated area D: school E: military base<n>Output:		D <n>Solution: <n><n>### Solution:<n>The first question can be reduced down to X = tapanga candy and Y = corey candies. 66 = 8 and we have to get to 29.<n><n>32  + X = 29<n><n>which means 9 + X = 23<n><n>solve for x: X = 4 +23<n><n>so X = 27<n><n>now go back to our first equation and subtract 27 for the X term.<n>\(\therefore 66 = 29 + 27 \)<n><n><n>Tapanga has 29 +27 = 56 candy as a ratio to Corey<n><n>The second and third question is much easy to answer.<n>First convert the cents terms to dollars. local call @ \($0.05 × 45 = 2.25 and international call @ \($0,25 × 31 = 7.75\) so far the grand total = \(2.25 + 7.75 = 10\). Finally we multiply the sum by the number of minutes we've talked and we get <n>\(10 × 76 = 760\)<n><n>The second question is a little more complicated as it involves fractions. we can find a simpler way to compute it by using the simple equation<n>\(\frac 8 x = \frac 56\)<n><n>so \(\frac 8x \frac x6 = \frac 54 = 5/4\)<n><n>multiply both sides by 2/5 and we get our solution: x = 10<n><n>As for the third question, divide each of the numbers by each other. so 80/8 = 10. which means Michael made 10 dollars.<n><n>for the 4th question we set out to solve a proportion we have at hand. we use the formula for proportions \(\frac{b}{a} = \frac{x}{y}\)<n><n>200 is a is equal to x and x/y = 3/4 and 3/4 of 10 puppis is 7 puppys sold. so \(200 = (3/4)7 which means x = 6 and \(6*4/4 =

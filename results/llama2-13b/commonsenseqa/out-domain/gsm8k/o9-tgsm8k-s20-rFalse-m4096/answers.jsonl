Choices: A: raced B: was going to have the best time C: had been watching all day D: raced fast E: was going to win\nOutput: C\nExplanation: They are all verbs, except \"had.\" You can't choose \"had\" because they already watched all day, so you cannot have \"had.\" They also cannot be \"was going to\" because that implies they are going to do an action. They are then left with \"raced, raced fast, and watched.\" \"Raced fast\" is an action, \"had been watching\" is not an action, and \"raced\" is an action. You can eliminate \"had been watching\" because we don't know when the action happens. It could be anytime. \"Raced fast all day\" is an action, we just don't know the timeframe in which it is done: the whole day, only in the morning, all day only at night, etc. The correct answer is \"raced\" because they are specifically at the track, and they are not doing the action the whole day. They will do it at multiple times during the day, but it is a specific time and place.\n\nInput:You should eat carrots because they help you get _____. Choices: A1: good eyesight.

One of the clients' concerns is that of being able to find and purchase local produce, while reducing travel time and cost as much as possible.\n\nUsing what you know about functions, lists, and dictionaries:\n\nCreate a function that takes three input variables as arguments, x, y, and local. The x and y variables represent the latitude and longitude of a desired pickup location.  The local variable represents a Boolean value indicating whether or not the client wishes to make a locally purchased (in other words, reduce the cost and travel time by picking up produce at a nearby location, rather than having produce delivered.).\n\nThe function returns a list of possible pickup locations. Given a latitude and longitude for a desired pickup location and a Boolean value indicating whether the client would prefer local produce, the function should return a list of possible pickpoints that also meet the specified parameters.\n\nFor example: if a client lives in Austin TX with a latitude and longitude of 30.26, -97.74; and they chose local produce, you might be asked to find them a pickup location at Kroger (11611 Metric Blvd Austin, TX 78758; Lattitude: 30.386608; Longitude: -97.813301).\n\n### Solution:\n\n```python\ndef checklist(x,y,local):\n    distance = abs(zipcodes[-1] - zipcodes[0])\n    distances = []\n    for j in zipcodes:\n        dj = distance(y,x,j,local)\n        distances.append(dj)\n    return distances\n```\n\n## Extra Credit\n\n### Problem:Find the largest number in a list?\n\nInput: `[45, 3.5 - 2, 34, 98]\nOutput: 98\n\nInput: `[89, 8, 9, 43, 23,", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

Do you really need to use `for` loops? If you remove that, it looks very different. Your `fear` variable is not used. You've copied the same input and output lines twice for every question.\n\nComment: I copied my code from the python documentation, where they gave as an example. It said to remove loops at the end but I didn't want to change anything but I did edit it. Any suggestions?\n\nAnswer: Your code has a couple of small errors.\n\nThere are two different sets of variables for each question. The first set in `candies`, `dollars`, and `books` is wrong the second set in `time`, `money`, and `puffy` is correct. This is confusing to the reader and potentially causes bugs. I renamed the question variables with `question`, since you already had set variables using the same word.\n\nThen there's the problem with your loops. You have the same loop twice, once for numbers 1 to 5, and another for numbers 6 to 7. Inside the loop you get the correct answer, and don't use the value of `question`, so it's not used in the output.\n\nTo summarise:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item You don't need a loop to process a single input\n\\item Change the loop that is processing the question input\n\\item Set up a format for your input and output\n\\item Fix your variable assignment in the for loops\n\\end{itemize}\n\nCode:\n\n\\begin{code}\ncandies_pct = (\n    'candy|'\n    'candies|'\n    '10-a-day|'\n    '500|'\n    'The candy had|'\n    'Tapanga had|'\n    )\nincome", "answer": "B: love"}

Calculates the percentage of input \n2. Convert input into perentage \n3. Returns the percentage or decimal converted for perentage conversion```\n\n    def f1(x):\n        per = 100/x\n        return per\n\n### f2(list(int)):    \n```1. Calculates the output \n2.

Add numbers to find the output```\n    \n    def f2(x,y):\n        res = x*y\n        return res\n\n## Question_1\nOutput: 14\n\nSolution: I first converted decimal to percentage then I found the total quantity using percentage and total value using perentage conversion to integer. Then I found the quantity remaining using percentage to integer conversion and then using multiplication to find the output.\n## Question_2\nOutput: 11 \n\nSolution: In this question, I used the conversion formula directly to calculate the total amount and I found the output amount using f2(x). Where x is the total amount, which is in dollars and I used f1(x)(100) to find the commission percentage.\n## Question_3\nOutput: 17\n\nSolution: This is a simple subtraction problem.\n## Question_5\nOutput: 20\n\nSolution: Here I first converted decimal to perentage and then found the amount sold which is 55% and quantity remaining I find it out using percentage to integer conversion. Then the total amount left over I calculate it using percentage to integer conversion again and finally I used multiplication to find the output amount. \n## Question_6\nOutput: 1500\n\nSolution : This is a simple perentage problem but I used the converted into integer using percentage to solve it.\n## Question_7\nOutput: 13\n\nSolution: \nHere I used the formula: P= N x", "answer": "B: learn about"}

{"idx": 575, "text": "#### Tips:\n\n- You can use the String class from Python to store the user's input as strings. This will ensure that the input is stored as a proper sequence of characters, and not as a number or any other type of data.\n- Always try to limit the length of the user's input to a reasonable length. This will help to keep the program within a reasonable timeframe and reduce the chance of runtime errors due to an overflowing stack or heap.\n- Using `raw_input()` is more suitable for accepting user input in Python because it accepts input as a string rather than as a number or any binary data type. Raw input is generally safer than using a variable to store the input when working with user input in Python programs. However, it would still be better to perform proper validation and sanitization of the input.\n- Using `print()` or `print()` can make the program more engaging and interactive. It will also make the process interactive.\n- Using `if`-`elif` statements is a good choice when there is a single right answer and you want to minimize the number of checks. This is because it will reduce the number of branches that the program needs to check against. However, this can have the downside of increasing the cognitive load on the user.\n- Try to use the `else` branch when you have multiple correct solutions, this can increase the cognitive load and make the program more difficult to understand. In some cases, it can be better to just have a single `if` statement that returns the answer. It will also provide the user with more structure to follow.", "answer": "E: internet sites"}

{"idx": 615, "text": "A\n\n\n**Answer Explanation**\n\n**Correct:** The correct answer is 'A', since the person went to the hardware store to get the tool. All of the other options are wrong because these locations are the wrong places where the person can find the tool.\n\nExample: An article says 'Fred bought a new table and a new bed. Where has he been shopping? A. hardware store B. building materials store C. antique store.'\n\nIf you had to choose the correct answer for this question, would you find the answers easily?\n\n**Hint:** In order to find the correct answer, try to determine the reason why an article asked the question at all. Try to understand what was the point of the question, where did the person shop, and the article wanted the reader to find out because the person bought a table and a bed. Therefore, the correct answer is 'B'.\n\nIn question a) the person did not mention that the candies of Tapanga and Core are different, so, when you find the common denominator, the denominator would be 66 and the numerator would be 9, giving you the answer 29.\nThe correct answer is 29\n\nIn question b) The information you receive from the question is a few facts about an international phone call and what the call cost. Knowing that the call came from Freddy, to dad and then to brother, and the information that the call totaled one dollar, you can easily determine how many phone calls were made that would result in a costs of one dollar. All the information you have is this table. \n![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/8qeQh93.png \"phone charge\"). All you have to do is go from the beginning till you encounter a dollar.\n``` 5 calls, 45 minutes\n31 minutes \n31 minutes 50 cents = 5 calls\n  2 minutes \n6 minutes 1 \n----------------------------------       1 dollar```\nSo, the correct answer would be 'choice 5' because there are 5 phone calls in total. You have to count them till you reach a dollar in total. Once you reach a dollar, you stop and consider the option that would give you the greatest answer. Therefore, the value of the answer would be 'choice one'.", "answer": "B: basement"}

The key is that you need to solve the CTF like you would solve a puzzle\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The first question is asking what number is the most occurring in the file, so use a tool (grep usually) that will show you each unique value and how many times it occurs (which was 65!).\n\\item Using the answer to the first question, find out how many candy bars Corey has. We know he has 8 fewer than Tapanga, so we find out that Tapanga gets (65 - 8).  Now we find out how many bars Tapanaga has left (65 - 57). Then, we can say that Corey = (65 - 29).\n\\item You have given three choices, so we try each one of them. First, we go to the phone bill and find out that the first number is.45 cents. Then we go to the rest of the answer choices and try and find out what number is.25 cents. We find out very quickly that (31 *.25) does not equal 25 cents! Therefore, the answer must be the first one, which is 5 dollars.\n\\item The question is asking you what the hours must be for each day, so find out what the first and second number are (8 and 5.5). You then go to the rest of your choices to find out what the next logical number is (5). Since that number is the one that has the fewest number of hours per day, you pick that one.\n\\item First, you add together all the amounts of books sold per day, which equals (a total of 76). Then, the question asks you to find out the number of books that were not sold. Since 76 of them were, 600 of them were not.\n\\item Since each birdhouse is", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}

{"idx": 932, "text": "D \nSolution: \n\n### Solution:\nThe first question can be reduced down to X = tapanga candy and Y = corey candies. 66 = 8 and we have to get to 29.\n\n32  + X = 29\n\nwhich means 9 + X = 23\n\nsolve for x: X = 4 +23\n\nso X = 27\n\nnow go back to our first equation and subtract 27 for the X term.\n\\(\\therefore 66 = 29 + 27 \\)\n\n\nTapanga has 29 +27 = 56 candy as a ratio to Corey\n\nThe second and third question is much easy to answer.\nFirst convert the cents terms to dollars. local call @ \\($0.05 \u00d7 45 = 2.25 and international call @ \\($0,25 \u00d7 31 = 7.75\\) so far the grand total = \\(2.25 + 7.75 = 10\\). Finally we multiply the sum by the number of minutes we've talked and we get \n\\(10 \u00d7 76 = 760\\)\n\nThe second question is a little more complicated as it involves fractions. we can find a simpler way to compute it by using the simple equation\n\\(\\frac 8 x = \\frac 56\\)\n\nso \\(\\frac 8x \\frac x6 = \\frac 54 = 5/4\\)\n\nmultiply both sides by 2/5 and we get our solution: x = 10\n\nAs for the third question, divide each of the numbers by each other. so 80/8 = 10. which means Michael made 10 dollars.\n\nfor the 4th question we set out to solve a proportion we have at hand. we use the formula for proportions \\(\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{x}{y}\\)\n\n200 is a is equal to x and x/y = 3/4 and 3/4 of 10 puppis is 7 puppys sold. so \\(200 = (3/4)7 which means x = 6 and \\(6*4/4 =", "answer": "D: school"}

Then if more people show up, I can always add a bigger cake.  What percent should I add to the cake for every 10 people?\n\nChoices:\n5%\n10%\n11.11%\n\nOutput:\nE\n\n\nThe question asks us to round 0.111111... to 1 significant Figure.\n\n0.111 is represented in a scientific notation as 1 \u00d7 10^-1.  1 is the mantissa or significand, and the exponent is 1x10^-1.\n0.11 = a \u00d7 10^x\n1 is the most significant digit we have, so it is what will remain in our significant figure.   We remove the decimal (remainder to the nearest integer is 0) and move the decimal point 1 position to the left.   Now, we have 1 x 10^0 in our form.  We get rid of the 1, and we get 0.01 x 10^-1 = 0.00111....    \n\nSo the rounding value is 0.1 significant digit, or 0.0\n\nInput: 3x + 5 = 13\n\nOutput:\nx = 2\n\nWe can solve it using the linear equations method.\nWe multiply the first equation with x and subtract it in the next equation:\n3x + (5-3x) = 13\n(3x + 2) = 13", "answer": "D: skill"}

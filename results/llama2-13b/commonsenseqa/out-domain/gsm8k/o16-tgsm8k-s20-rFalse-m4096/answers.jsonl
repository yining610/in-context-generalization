A room can take a minimum of 2 chandeliers, at least. For every two chandeliers, a room will cost \\$300.00 to light up.  For every three chandeliers, it will cost \\$350.00.  When a large number is needed in a room, a small discount is sometimes given; for every 4 chandeliers, the cost per chandeliers is \\$10.00 less.  The manager\u2019s boss has called an all-hands meeting, and demands a report on how efficiently the company can light the rooms.  The manager asks what the largest number of chandeliers is that the company can light up with \\$5,000.00. Answer in terms of an integer value; that is, a value that can be exactly a whole number. \nAnswers: The only possible values the input can have are a 1000 and 1200. However, we calculate that the only possible combinations of chandelier numbers that could result in an answer of 5000 dollars would be 20 rooms needing 3 chandeliers at $350 each equals 7000 dollars, 60 rooms needing 2 chandelers at $300 each equals 18,000 dollars, or 70 rooms needing 1 chandeliers at 140 dollars each equals $10,000 + 9,800 = 19,800, but the closest answer is 12 rooms needing 15 chandeliers at \\$240 each equals 2880 = 920 dollars left over.\n```\n\n#### Solution\n\n<details>\n<summary>Open solution</summary>\n\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_biggest_sum(arr):  # arr is a list of tuples where the first item of each is a number and the second is a number representing the cost of that many lights, ie 1000,300 or 500,", "answer": "C: big city"}

Since we're negative two, we do -2x5 - (-2x9)  \n  and we got 60 - 18 = 42  \n2. The correct answer is $ 10.  \n3. The answer is 5.  For this one, we set up an equation.  \n  Let x = number of hours  \n  So 4x = 32, x = 8  \n4. The answer is 600. For this one you need to subtract the amount that was removed from the total amount.

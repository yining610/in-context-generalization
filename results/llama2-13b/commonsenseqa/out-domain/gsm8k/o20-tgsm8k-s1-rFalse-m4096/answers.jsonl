For example  she doesn\u2018t like any sort  of food that hasn\u2018t been cooked, as well as she doesn\u2018t mind if  it has had the chance to ferment, and enjoys the taste.  She will only drink the liquids that have been left out in the sun long enough that it has grown a very thick layer of mold; even if it\u2019s so thick it will take her at least a week to drink the contents of the bottle.  All of that is just the way she likes the outside of her food, but the way Sarah really shows us her inner workings is how she reacts towards food she is forced to put into her mouth.  As we all know, the best way to tell someone\u2018s feelings about an item or idea or food is to simply sit back and watch their reaction once they are exposed to said item/idea/food.  Let\u2018s look at those.  A little while back, she had been given some sort of sandwich.  The type of sandwich she received did not specify which kind it was.

In her mind, that was clearly code for: \u201cYou better eat this sandwich, you little monster.\u201d  Regardless, after noticing what the cafeteria workers had clearly labeled \u201cA sandwich\u201d, Sarah got in line.  The cafeteria workers didn\u2018t notice her at first, but when they did she held up her hand as if  to say \u201cI\u2018ve got this\u201d to another fellow classmate that had been given the same item.  Finally, when it was her turn she took the sandwich off the tray and held it out at arms length, as if some sort of radiation was leaking out of it.  Then, she held it about 3 inches from her face, making sure not to touch any part of the sandwich with any part of her arm.  Then, she took a huge bite.  She took the biggest bite she could possibly take, and then, even chewed and swallowed the biggest bite she possibly could.  After she looked as if she\u2018d", "answer": "D: heal"}

For Questions 2, 4, 5, and 7, I multiplied the number by $10, which would give me 4 times the original number. For questions 6 and 9, I just counted the number for each object. For Question 8, I divided each object by $1 with three extra pieces in total. For question 10, I multiplied one with another three times or 50 divided by 5. For question 11, I divided the number by 5 and multiplied it by 4, which were the number of objects. For question 12, I noticed that the number was decreasing by each statement and added the three different numbers and subtracted it from the original number (220). For question 15, I divided the amount by 10, the total number of objects. For Question 15, I counted the number of objects each time. For question 16, I divided each amount and added them together. For question 17, I divided the amount to find each object's ratio and multiplied them together.

We start by reading the problem and breaking down the information provided by the question. When reading a multiple choice question, the first thing that you want to pay attention to is the question statement.\n2. **First, let's identify the question statement:** \n> Mary had 89 stickers. She used 3 large\n> stickers on the frontpage of her journal and\n> 7 stickers each 6 other pages of\n> her journal. How many sticker's does\n> Mary have remaining?\n\n    Mary used some sticker for 6 other pages of the journal. The key thing here is **\"each\", which indicates that Mary used 7 stickers for all the pages.**\n\n3. **Now that we have identified the question statement, we can break down the information provided. We can start by identifying the variables:** \n> \n>    Mary had 89\n>\t\tstickers\n>     She used 3 large \n>\t\tsticker's on the frontpage of\n> \t    her journal, how many stickers\n>\t\tdoes each of the 6 other pages\n>\t\tof her journal\n>\t\n>    = 7\n\n4. **After defining and identifying the variables, we can go ahead and solve our math problem. Let's start by simplifying the math expressions:** \n>    Mary has remaining: = \n>    = \n>       89 - 3 \n>\t   - \n>       7 x 6 \n>\t   = =  64 \n>\n>    Mary has  remaining = 64\n\n### [Praction](https://www.myworkday.com/r1/tdg1133p/careerjobs/d/task/1422$1981.html?q=python&loc=3000)\n\nIn this challenge, you will be asked a", "answer": "B: own cars"}

Therefore, the difference for the 4 digits is 9000.\n-The second 4 digits will always also stay the same. Therefore the difference for the 2 digits is 0000. \n-The last 2 digits is only 00 from the starting number, therefore, the difference for the the last 2 digits is 9.\n\nWe can now solve to get 999+9000+0000+9=10998\n\nThen, subtract 1\n\n10998 - 1 = 10997\n\n## Answer: 105", "answer": "D: have lunch"}

After going through all the questions, the first half was pretty easy, but when it came to those more advanced ones, all our assumptions would end up failing.\n\nI figured out that for the question related to money and percentages, there were some pretty tricky twists.\n\nFor instance, we learned that when calculating the total amount you need to spend the question would ask \"Mark has kangaroos.  Kangaroo have two legs.  If he had 23 kangaroo and three times as many geese as kangaroos, what is the total number off legs of all Mark's animals?\". The question would then go out to ask \"The total number of legs of Mark's animals is 322?\". This question seems easy if you can think of them in a straight line. But if you have to think about it like this 2+2 = 4 (2 because there are 2 legs for 1 kangaroo) x 60 (60 legs because he has 3 times more geese", "answer": "B: polished"}

To answer any of them, use simple algebra to translate the English sentence into an equation. \n\n\n\nWhen faced with an expression like \u201cHe\u2019s spent 10 dollars less than she did\u201d, it first looks like it should have an equal sign between the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 spending, such as \u201c15 dollars - 5 dollars = 10 dollars\u201d. But this is incorrect because such an equation fails to take into account the \u201cless than\u201d part. To solve that expression, we use the following formula:\n\n$$\n{15 + 5 - 10} = {20 - 5}\n$$\n$$\n10 = {20 -5} = {20 \u2013 50\\%*20}\n$$\n$$4 = 20\\% = 4\\times0.2\n$$\n\nWhen faced with a simple percentage, the next step is to find that out of the total amount:\n\n$$\n5/20 = {10\\%} = 5%\n$$\n\nNow, you\u2019ll find that the expression \u201cHe spent 7 dollars and then 2 dollars\u201d can be solved by a simple algebraic equation, using this information:\n\n$$\nHe spent 8 dollars = 7 + 2 = {6 + 1.5} = 7.5\n$$\n\nIn the expression \u201c8 dollars before tax, and 5 after tax\u201d, you\u2019ll find that you need to first find the \u201c8 dollars before tax\u201d expression. Once you have that, then you simply subtract the after tax dollar amount, which has already been given to you:\n\n$$\n8 + 6 = 14 before tax\n$$\n$$\n5 = 14 - 8 = 6 - 8 = 5 - 6 = 8/8 = 1\n$$\n$$\n8 before tax = 14\n$$\n$$\n9 before tax\n$$\n\nIn other cases, you\u2019ll find there are several equations involved. In these cases, it may be best solved by substitution and", "answer": "A: being for"}

The pizza is generally cut into slices and eaten while hot, along with some dressing, such as tomato sauce, pesto or olive oil. The name \u2018pizza\u2019 originally came from Latin word \u2018pinsa\u2019. It is believed that the word \u2018pinza\u2019 means mold for pressed/stamped bread while another theory is that the original Neapolitans called the pizza bite \u2018pizzetta\u2019. Today, the \u2018pizza\u2019 is sold worldwide and every country has a unique taste for it.\n\nPizza is always served in a hot, fresh and well baked kind of manner. It is considered as Italian-American cuisine and today is a common fast food.\n\nAlong with being yummy it is also high in carbs & calories. Every bite of pizza will cost you around 170-290 calories.\n\nIf you add toppings like meat, vegetables, or dairy products on your pizza slice, it will turn into an unhealthy choice. The basic pizza may contain some 300 calories but if topped with meat it may go high up to 700 calories or even more. As it is known that carbohydrates are the major ingredient, every serving of pizza offers 50-90 grams of carbs.\n\nIf you want to eat or have pizzas every day you can but to reduce and balance the calories intake by 50 % take only one slice. For a slice of pizza, choose the crust of whole wheat. This will give you around 120 calories and in case, you want to keep the carbs intake balance only add the tomato sauce and cheese. This kind of pizza will still provide you the necessary nutrients, but will reduce the daily calories by a lot.\n\nEven when you dine out at restaurants, you will find every other person consuming pizzas and burgers.

I suggest you post some code and explain where you are stuck.\n\nAnswer: There are two different kinds of problems: numeric problems (in C, where you use a loop and convert 1 char in the string to a number), and not-numeric problems (either you know the answer already, or you simply must find a way to pass the test by making the output be C (or A,B,D,E, in order of preference to C, but any will pass as long as there is C and E in it))\n\nNumeric problems are fairly easy once you realise you simply cannot use regular expressions for them. You will be using the built-ins functions in the python std lib, the str and int types, and a for loop. Numeric problems usually have many inputs (e.g. Zach is saving his money), or have to have many different output options (\"C\").\n\nNot-numeric problems are generally where you use a for-loop and a simple `if (input_string == some_condition)':\n\n\\begin{code}\ncondition = 'child'\nif input_string == condition:\n\\end{code}}\n\nThese tend to be more difficult. But once you've got used to all the types, there's not much else to use.\n\nThere is no way to just hard code an answer. All the tests can be changed to match. Even if you write out all the tests and the possible output as a big table, you can still write incorrect tests (that fail a valid solution) or fail to account for the fact that the test-setters sometimes don't fully account for the answer to one of the tests.\n\nComment: And the problem is that you can't solve the problems. These aren't test cases, they're just random questions. The answers aren't always 'C' or E. E can sometimes be X or anything other than Z, like A,B,D or F.\n\nComment: Oh, I wasn't aware that there were so many cases. The 'C' case", "answer": "E: competence"}

There is an alternative solution, which isn't really the more efficient solution, but should be fairly straight forward to those who have never done this before. The alternative is to get a list of all the instructions and the answer, and then run a loop to solve the puzzles. However, there is a better way, which you can read all about below!\n\n##### If you are having trouble with the puzzle part, the alternative solution is to take the questions you have been given from this part of the program, and run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\na = [1,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]\nb = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11']\nfor i in range (25):\n    print(a[i], '-', b[i])\n    ans = eval(b[i]) + int(a[i])\nexcept:\n    ans = int(\"0\")\nprint(\"The answer is:\", ans)\n```\n\n### How to solve the puzzles:\n\nThe key part in solving the puzzles is to turn the text instructions into numbers. We can do this with eval, the built-in function. Eval is used to evaluate something, meaning it gives it an answer and returns the answer. In Python, you usually use it with things like mathematical operations, but can also use it on text as well in this project. For example, if we used eval on an instruction like:\n\n```python \n\"Mary had 89 stick and used 3 large stick and 7 stick to 6 other pages. How many she have remaining?\"\n```\n\nThe answer would be 3 large stick and seven sticks to six other pages. This means that we need to solve for those other numbers, which is", "answer": "E: school"}

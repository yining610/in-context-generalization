Some day, however, computers will become more powerful than the human brain; with intelligence approaching, then surpassing our own. Computers will likely become the most powerful tools ever known. At first blush, the notion of computers surpassing the human brain may seem ludicrous. However, this is not the case. Computer power has grown at a rate of 100,000 times more in the past thirty years than the growth of the human brain in the past thirty thousand years.  Today's personal computers can process information and do complex calculations at a rate of more than a thousand million (one thousand million!) "thoughts" per second.<n>Computer scientists and engineers now routinely predict that computers capable of carrying out the thoughts and actions of a human brain will be built in a few decades. They are also quite confident that by then it will be possible for computers to communicate with us in our own language.  The day computers outstrip human intelligence is bound to arrive; how soon will it come? No one knows. It's impossible, however, to deny the potential that computers have to impact our lives. We already depend on them.  Perhaps you write reports on your computer and print them out with it. Or maybe you've designed your own Web page or used your computer to research a report for school or work. Computers have brought us many useful tools in the past three decades.  There's no denying that they make our lives better, safer, and more productive. However, this won't last.  It will come to an end when we build the greatest computer this world has ever seen. <n><n># Instrucions: Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Instruction 1: What was the first personal computer built?  <n><n>Answer: 1) Apple<n><n>### Inst instruction 2: Why is it impossible to deny the potential of computers in our lives?<n><n>Answer:     1) We use computers to make our personal lives better. <n><n>### Instructions 3: When will computers surpass the human brain with intelligence?<n><n>Answer: 2) within

When it reaches the sum of all the variables (excluding the initial value of the variable) it sums those values up and gives us the answer. If its in the thousands it rounds to the hundred and it will continue that process until we have the right answer. If its in decimals it will get the right answer. Also, the program checks if the number is negative and will print “You Don’t Have That in Your Wallet.”<n><n>I would say the code is pretty clean, because it is easy to understand and I don’t see a lot of comments to explain what it is doing. Only in some parts I have commented about certain features, such as saying “This method is used to find the maximum amount…“ This is only used in parts where I have implemented methods into the program. The code was easy to read and understand, because it is in a well put-together manner.<n><n><n>### What did you learn from this exercise<n>I learned about methods being used in a more complex way, instead of just using them to output stuff. I also learned how to compare different numbers together and how the program deals with the problem in hand. Also, I learned how the program keeps a check on the total value of the person’s wallet to make sure that it is not negative.<n><n>I learnt about methods, if clauses, switch case, double.<n><n>I learnd that you can ask the computer some questions of what's going on in a program, then the program can analyze everything and then it can answer your questions.<n><n>I learmed how to put a comment so that other people can understand what's going on and how long will the program will run.<n><n><n>[](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/beginner-python-3/0/2/1?curriculum_id=5caa1fca0177f600041f0238&path_slug=problem-solving-with-python&code_redirect=true&code_repo=NvNX3XbT976kV5

We can break it down as 89 minus 27 + 7 * 6 = x<n><n>The equation will look like:<n>89 - 27 + 42 = x<n>54 + 42 - 27 = x<n>44 + x = 89<n><n>Since 44 + x > 89, x cannot be negative. x must be 44.  Mary has forty four stickers remaining.<n><n><n>### 2,26 <n><n>The question asked us to figure how much more money Zach had to earn before he could buy a $100 bike with a weekly allowance of $5 and additional money he receives from his parent and his neighbor.<n>We can break down the word problem by creating equations on how much money he makes each week and how much they would be adding up to over time.   <n><n>Week 1 = $5   <n>Week 2 = $5 x2 = $10   <n>Day 3 = $5 x 3 = $15   <n>Day 4 = 5 x 4 = $20   <n>Day 5 = $5 x 5 = $25   <n>Day 6 = $5 x 6 = $30   <n>Day 7 = $5 x 7 = $30

That leaves 89-72= 17 stickers remaining.<n>- Here we can find answer by solving a simple equation X+3(1)-5X+10 = 0.<n>- Another way to solve this question is by representing a problem with a system of equations.<n><n>  X+Y = 4<n><n>  X+4Y = 8<n><n>  X+9Y = 12<n><n>  X+36Y = 64<n><n>- It is a division question where you need to divide something by 2 and then by 3. For example 20÷2 = 10 and then 10÷3 = -3. You can see the answer by using simple division or by finding out what are those numbers that are multiples of 6 which you can easily find through a multiplication. One such number is 18 where 18÷3 = 6 and 18÷2 = 9.<n>- Just solve 23^2 =??. The answer is 276 because 8^(4x5) = 276 and 8 is the number of dots in 23.<n>- Multiply 20 and 2. This is equivalent to moving the decimal point 2 times to the right and will result in 2000. Add the amounts given, namely 10, 750. Multiply 30 and 6, this is equivalent to moving the digit 2 places to the right. This sums up to $1800.  You can also add the amounts you receive

Choices:  A: new hampshire B: dairy farm C: farm field D: texas E: county fair<n>Output:		B<n><n><n>*   I worked on the logic behind the code. I was able to find some flaws in the answers for some questions and after fixing those the code runs smoothly for the most part.<n>*   I used several methods to improve the code. I first tried to implement `choice` function. This was the base of my code and I tried to add the condition on the choice question so that the questions will be answered according to that. Then I tried to implement the same method in `single` question which was a bit tricky I have to say. But as I have to work on the logic of the code I was able to achieve that. I also used the `for` loop method to implement the calculation part of the code.<n><n><n>*   A very helpful resource was the link to the questions provided by Johnathan Zhang. Through this link I was able to understand the exact structure of the questions and make my code better.<n><n>*   In addition to that, I went through a lot of articles that helped me in the understanding the exact structure of the code and the way the code should be approached. The first few articles were a struggle but later on I started to understand how these questions are supposed to be answered and how exactly to structure my code for better results.<n><n><n>*  After working through this code with the `choice` question and trying out the logic behind it I was able to work on the `single` questions. Apart from that, in `single` questions most part of the code structure remains same. So I just had to insert different conditions to achieve the correct result.<n><n><n>* In future I will be able to structure my code and understand the exact ways to implement the logic in questions.<n>* I will also focus on some practice questions by Johnathan or any other source. This will help me in approaching the questions confidently.<n>* I will try to make sure that while working the code, I will not be biased towards any structure and try to find a code that fits perfectly with the question and is easy to solve in future.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: strongwoman B: cake C: regular D: weak E: fragile<n>Output:		B<n><n>**Explanation:** There are three answers that can confuse a user: 'B', 'C', and 'E'. But when considering the root word, the 'C' option would mean the bowel movements can go'regularly'. But that is not the intention of the question. So the only answer that can confuse a human user is 'E', but by using a word-similarity-check approach, we can filter the correct and wrong answer with high accuracy<n><n>Input:  What does the word "cabbage" mean? Choices: 1. Mentally incapacitated 2. Moved about while sleeping 3. Deliberately ambiguous 4. Slow moving cereal 5.

There are only two words in the choice of answers that use 'cabb' as a root; 'cereal' and'vegetable'. However if you look up the origin of the word "cereal", cereal is not known to slow moving cereals, but the term "cereal killer" can mean a slow moving person. So, the only option is the letter 'C'.<n><n>Input:  I'm going to go over to Mary's house for _____.

But if the word 'A' was the correct answer, why would you go to the movies with pizza and sleepover at a person's house? So, the only correct answer is the 'B'.<n><n>Input: In a game, you have to roll six dice to get _____.

First, we need to convert this into a decimal value. This is simply by dividing the numbers in the exponent by ten and adding it on to the base, so<n>0.279 is now 0.27 in the form of decimal. Now it is to be multiplied by 3000,00, because this is the total number of employees that we are working with. This means 2930 is the answer.<n>

If number in question begins with $, it means<n>answer in question is money, you can skip the decimal<n><n>2. If there's no $, the question might asking about:<n><n>   • total in array<n>   • left in array<n>   • the time it takes to do anything<n>   • count<n><n>3. In first questions, there's no $, so you can just use loop and  sum.<n><n>4. In next three question, if the answer is in form<n>   * 4,3,2,1, you can calculate it in each iteration (one loop)<n><n>5.  The answer in questions 5, 6 is the left-over, you have to<n>subtract the left-over from 23, 65.<n><n>   The answer is always a negative number, which is the number<n>   of left-over of money.<n><n>6. In question 7, the question want you to get the number<n>in each loop. The answer is always a positive number, 3 in loop<n>1, 4 in loop second and so on.<n><n>   You just have to check by hand the answer is<n>   the same as the answer in question.<n><n>7. Answer in question 8 is an average. You cannot calculate a<n>average in one loop, so you have to implement it with two loops.<n>One loop is for input of array data, the second is to calculate<n>the average.<n><n>8. Answer in question 9 is a total number of left-over. It is <n>total of left-over each time in four round. This is actually a<n>sum of all the numbers in four loops so that you can use a <n>for(int) loop to solve it.<n><n>9. If you skip the part of decimals, it is clear enough you can<n>get the answer for a couple of question using sum(). You can <n>also calculate the percentage for number 10.<n><n>10. In last questions, the question is calculating how many<n>money it left over. You know this is a sum of all the money in<n>10 round so you just use forloop to solve it.<n>

They're doing the same, but the outputs are different.<n><n>Comment: Are you saying you are trying to use your Bluetooth module and apples app to try to answer those questions?<n><n>Comment: Yes, I am using my Bluetooth module and my iPhone to answer the 6 questions.  I've tried to fix that, but the only output I get whenever I send an option is the 9th question, in where I have to answer C to go to the Arduino code.<n><n>Answer: The code you posted, I don't see it as the actual code for an answer, but the test code for testing an answer. The way you do this is to use<n><n>\begin{blockquote}<n><n>output(some_var)<n>\end{blockquote}<n><n>if you want it to output a string. The code I just posted does NOT answer the question, but if the output you get includes `Arduino code C` then most likely it worked, else not.<n><n>I could be wrong, but there needs to be more info.

Choices:  A: being understood B: beer C: playing around D: hug E: visiting friends<n>Output:		D: playing around<n><n>Input:  Given a string of words, determine whether words in it rhyme. Words rhyme if any pair of them differ in first and last sound and have either the same vowel interspersed with consonants or have a consonant followed by a vowel sound. (Example: house, mouse, horse). A word will only be accepted if it rhymes.<n>Output: Yes<n><n>Input:Given a string of words, count the number of unrepeated words in it. Words are said to be repeated if they have identical or similar meanings (for example, "fly" and "flying"); otherwise, they are completely different. For example, "fly", "flying", "flyer", "fly away", "flew", "flying", and "few" should be counted as six unique words.<n>Output: 7<n><n>Input:Givem text from one or more files and count the number of times that one word from a dictionary appears in it.<n>The number of occurrences of a word should therefore be no greater than the number of lines in the given text. Words that appear in the text but whose meanings are completely different or are homonyms are treated as unrepeated words.<n>Output: Yes <n><n>Input:Consider whether 2 strings can be mapped to each other.<n>Note that a mapping of 2 strings is said to be valid if the first string can be transformed into the second through a process that changes only certain characters. For example, the strings "dog" and "dig" cannot be mapped to each other since the mapping does not preserve the length of the given string. However, the strings "dog", "dig" and "dogged" are said to be mapped to each other through a process that swaps every vowel in the first string with the first letter in "dig" (producing "dug", "dgi" and "doged", respectively) and swaps the second character in the first string with "d" (this generates "d", "o", and "g", respectively).<n>Output: Yes<n>

In my case, the answers would display as options rather than answers, which would have been confusing for the user. When I asked my instructors, they recommended asking a question instead, and that I could ask the questions directly, or have a placeholder value and only set it when they wanted one of the question's answer to be their choice.<n><n>I used the question method, which is a much more natural way to handle choices. I also used multiple `if` statements to cover different scenarios, something I had avoided because of my lack of experience with that style of statement. The instructor recommended it as being a good way to organize things, so it's a helpful skill to have in my toolbox.<n><n>Overall, I'm happy with the result. The code looks clean, and it seems like it would be easy for most people to understand and use.<n><n>

You do not want to solve the problem all at once, or try to solve it in large parts. Instead, you are going to solve it in very small portions or parts. You will solve the smaller parts one at a time. For each smaller part you solve, write down your answer. In the end, add up the answers from each part you solved to get your final answer. A problem can be divided into parts by using variables, mathematic terms, brackets, or grouping symbols.<n><n>Let's solve the math problem:<n><n>2 + 5 = 7<n><n>How should you do it?<n><n>Do not worry about memorizing the following steps yet.<n><n>The variables first came to my mind are (c, d, h) for Corey, Dad, and Home, respectively. But the instructions do not tell me how many and what type of candy I have. I will create a few more variables to find out the number of candies for each person. The problem is the question, How many candies does each person have? The answer seems to be, how many candies Corey has, Tapanga has, Dad has, and Home has. Therefore, the variables that I choose will be (C, H, D, & C) for Corey, Home, Dad, and Candy, respectively.<n><n>The first thing I must do is to make Tapanga has less candy than Corey. The first equation I must create is an equation that determines how many candies do Corey have. My goal is to make sure that the candy Tapanga has is lesser than the candy that Corey has. How can I tell whether or not candy Tapanga have less candy than Core does? Candy is a plural term. So I can compare the candy Tapang have with the candies.<n><n>The answer is C - H = -D<n><n>Which means the difference between Corey's candy and Tapanga's candy is equal to the amount Dad's candy.<n><n>To make it look clean and organized, put the number 8 in the (D) position by itself.<n><n>C - H = 8<n><n>The next equation I must create is to find out how many candies T

The largest tiger ever recovered in the wild measured over 14 feet with a skull cap of over 20 inches, weighing nearly 1000 pounds (Mazák et al 1987, Patterson and Lowe 1985).<n><n>Sumatran Tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae)<n><n>`The Sumatran tiger, also known as the Sumatran Barb or Sunda Tiger...<n><n><n>	Sumatran tigers are found exclusively in Sumatra, Indonesia.

The tigers in the zoos include 6 sub-species of tigers and not necessarily Sumatran tigresses. Some zoos and wildlife parks have the Sumatran tigess as well. In these facilities the breeding effort is directed mainly at reestablishing the sub-species in conservation breeding centres in Indonesia, rather than increasing numbers in captivity.<n><n>`The Bengal tiger, also known in India as the Royal Beng

Now that I have my answer in the negative numbers column I just added 48 to get Corey´s candy number: 29. For the second question, I broke New Year's day apart to two part to get the minutes then I added them to the local cost minutes, 45+31=76. I multiplied 76 times.05 to get 3.8 dollars. the third question was just math and I added the 5 days times the 8 hours to get 40 hours. For the fourth question I subtracted the 600 books sold to get 200  I did the same for the rest and at the end I got the correct answer. For the last question Michael´s total income was 22+16+7=45, all together he needed 97 dollars to get the answer right. For the last question, I would just look through the options and see which one sounds most correct and choose it that way.

Instuction: Answer the following multiple-choice question.The city council of a town banned the wearing of sandals on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (but not other days) in order to preserve the town's cultural heritage (but not the environment or public health). The town's mayor recently signed into law a new ordinance banning all types of footwear on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

The program needs to find the amount of candies that each person has, then subtract the amount of candies of the other. Note that candies can be represented using numbers with different values. Each number can be incremented by one each time the program meets that number, and can then be decremented by one when the program meets its value. Note that the program can run infinitely, since two variables are always increasing or decreasing with increasing values, then meeting at 66, the same number of increasing variables. One should start from 0 values for both number of variables. It is a little difficult to write a program for this question with loops from 0 value to 66 value.<n><n>### Answer1:<n><n>```<n>#include<stdio.h><n><n>int main()<n>{<n>int A,B;<n>A=8;<n>B=0;<n>printf("Tapanga and Corey together have 66 candes.

Choices: 32 49 24 123<n>Output: 24<n>Note: Derek gets points that are calculated in the following manner: Derek gets 20 points for every unique scrabble tile he used. Therefore, he gets 20 points ×2 = 40 points for each unique letter in the grid. However, Derek cannot spell the word 'two'. He is not awarded any points for doing so. Additionally, once a scrabble tile has been used and placed into the word search grid, it immediately loses its score of 20 points and hence cannot be used again. He also gets the double point option for every time he uses 'two'. This option is also available upon the end of each turn as is indicated by the 'double points' sign.<n><n>Input:How old is Peter?

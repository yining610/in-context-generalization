For example, instead of creating a string "a" and then creating another string "x" and adding them together to make "ax", why not just create a string "ax" and concatenate it with itself?  Or, instead of creating a number 2, and putting a star in front of it, why not create the string "2005" and concatenate the string with itself?  You will not need help with that problem, but it's an example of how to think about the problem in an easier way.<n>2. The questions all have something in common, and it's important to figure out the similarity and general formula.  It will help you understand the question better and write an easier function.<n>3. Once you've written the correct code, you know it's correct because the tests will pass.  Sometimes, you may think something is correct when it's not, but if you let your brain rest for a bit and look at the problem from afar, you'll more than likely figure out the error that you made.  You should have a "wow" feeling when you write correct code for these questions.<n>

Your program should take in a text, and output 3D objects in your choice of library (for instance, OpenGL if you use Processing), with the text being displayed as follows:<n><n>If your choice of library supports color, you should use it in a striking manner, to be sure.<n>You should be sure to use color in a manner that makes the text more 3-dimensional. You can find my example on Processing in this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEUgw2fXHzw<n>For example, you could use an animated GIF as the texture for the cube (be sure to have the image at least 100 pixels high, and square). You will need to do some research. Good luck!<n>Note: if you use C or C++, be sure you research on how to change font size in those languages.<n>Note: You will not receive "Partial credit" for submissions that are partially correct. There are multiple steps in the problem statement, and you must pass all of them to be accepted by the autograder, regardless of how well or poorly you perform in other steps.

Below is a sample of what your program will need to do.<n># The numbers you'll have to generate are randomly selected, so if your program does not generate the same numbers we produced, that's fine! The important thing is to show that you understand how your for-in statement makes the code work, and how it allows you to generate a random sequence of integers.<n># Challenge: The first two lines of the program we wrote to generate this sequence appear below. Can you write the code necessary to generate a sequence of 10 integers greater than 150 and less than 200?<n># First, take a guess at the first value in the sequence. Next, generate a number between 0 and 9. Remember that 0 doesn't work, since it is not between 1 and 9. Now, if the number you generated is 1, then you're done! This is because it's the first number in the sequence and all you have to do now is generate the next nine. If your number is not 1, take two guesses as to which numbers will come next in the sequence; we think that 172 and 151 will work!<n>Input: First try to guess what the first number will be. Then, try to see which of the next nine numbers you can guess!<n>Output: 192<n><n># Challenge: We need you to write a for-in statement for this program, and then try your best to get it to generate a random sequence just like the one illustrated above! For practice, try it with the following sequence. You can do it on paper if you want, but it's important that you understand how the for-in statement works in Python!<n># Hint: It doesn't always have to start at 0! Just type out the steps you performed below to generate each number in the sequence. Remember that 0 is between 1 and 2, but you don't want to guess an integer between 0 and 1, and 2 and 3! If the sequence you generate is different than the one above, don't

We were out in the country and it rained off and on. But the weather is never too bad for me to drive a distance and get somewhere. The road curved around hills, fields of crops, farms, a few copses of trees that I spotted from a distance, and a few towns. After I turned,  it would take me about an hour before i could turn back. I always take that same route because I've driven there so often. There was only one small road off the main road I was on. I could have turned onto that road, but I knew it would lead to another town to the west that I really had no intention to drive to.  And I knew if I had to turn and come all the way back, it would take another 20 minutes, and it was too far for just a short detour  or a short break for a few hours. I didn't want to go through several small towns and go to a town I had been to only once before, that's why I had the car. The first stop I made was to a service station. I really had to use the bathroom. So i drove over to the service station and went inside and walked around the racks and racks of cans of motor oil and candy and tobacco and drinks. Inside the door was a large coffee table-like structure that had the daily papers, many of them folded open at the front-page stories. There were a couple of chairs on either side of the table, too, and a TV against one wall, but it wasn't on.  I guess it was 5 P.M. by now, so it would be late for it to start showing the evening newscast. But there was nobody in the television store room and nobody in the convenience store room. I got out of there quickly. On my way back out the door, I noticed another room on the left that looked like some kind of storage room. Two large filing cabinets stood in front of it and I could smell the old papers inside them. I wanted to go into the restroom. I got back into the car. There was a convenience store across from the service station I had just left. The name of the store across the road was "Big-R".  There weren't many cars going through that area. I thought

The cost of one kilograms of dries fruits is 8 dollars. Adam bought 3 kilogram of nuts and 1.5 kilograms dries fruits. So we can calculate it like this<n><n>$$2.5(8)=$$ $$\Rightarrow 20$$$$*1.5=$$ $$\Rightarrow 30$$$$*5=$$ $$\Rightarrow $$ $(3 × 5)=$$$$*(12)=$$ $$64$$$$64÷2$$$$\Rightarrow 32$$ $$\Rightarrow 56$$<n><n>Question 2: $$2+1/3=5/3$$<n><n>Question 3: Firstly, find out 200+20% of 200.<n><n>$$200+(20%of200)$$ $$200+40=$$ $$\Rightarrow 240$$<n><n>We can see that we can get the number 480 by multiplying number 12 by 100\%. Because 100\% means the total of number 12.<n><n>$$12×100=$$ $$\Rightarrow $$ $$1200$$<n><n>Now we will find out the numbers 10 and 20. Because 200+480=$$680$$.<n><n>$$680÷12$$ $$ \Rightarrow 56$$ $$ and$$ $$680÷10$$ $$ \Rightarrow 68$$<n><n>So $$10×56$$ $$ =$$ $$ 560$$$$ and$$ $$20×56$$$$  =$$ $$1120$$$$<n><n><n>Question 4:<n><n>When James buying the fuel at a price was 10 dollars a gallon. But now we can see that fuel price is rising rapidly. It was 15 dollars a gallon. Firstly, we can calculate 20% of 10.<n><n>$$10×20=$$ $$\Rightarrow$$ 200<n>$$200÷10$$ $$\Rightarrow $$$$ 20$$<n>We can see that 1 gallon used in 15 dollars. Now we can see how many gallons he uses in

(You can not select pasta.)<n>A: pasta<n>B: cheese<n>C: apple sauce<n>D: sushi<n>E: chicken<n><n>Suggestions:<n>  * In the first example, we multiply the cost of 3 Kg nuts by 12 and the cost of 2.5 Kg dried fruits by 8. <n>  * In the second example, we count the number of hours and then add 1 hour for warming up and doing other cardio exercises. <n>  * For the third example, since we assume that the cost of fuel always increases by the same percent we can get the answer with a single multiplication: 200 * (1 + 20%) = 240.<n>  * In the game of league soccer, we write and two equations:<n>     + (1 - \*\*20%\*\*)/1 +  2x* 20% = 300<n>  to find each goal scorer. Subtract the 1 from each side of the equation to get<n>  \*\*(1 - \*\*40%\*\*)+ x* 40% = 240<n>  where \*\*40\%\*\* was not a typo. (There is a 20% increase in total goals scored against the opposing team, and we also divide the total number of goals against that team by 2 because 2 players did it.) Next, we subtract 1/3 from each side of the next equation and we get<n>  x = 80,<n>  which means that each of the two players got 80 goals for a total of 160 goals.<n>  <n><n>### Instruction:Review the following programs and identify one syntax error.<n>```<n>if (myInt!= 0)<n>  doSomethingElse();<n>  {<n><n><n>if (myString == "Hello" || myString == "Bye")<n>  doSomethingDifferent();<n>  else<n>  doSomethingElse;<n>```<n><n>The last parenthesis `)` was incorrectly put.<n><n>```<n>if (isFriday())<n>{<n>  print("It's Friday!");<n>}<n>else

You know the basic idea here -- every time you code something, write the unit tests to validate that the code is working correctly. In earlier course modules, you have seen some unit tests. In this module, you will see more.<n><n>As you can see, writing unit tests is more than just a good idea or an alternative approach to testing. It **is** a real testing and validation effort -- for many development teams these are the only test efforts they do!<n><n>The concept of writing the unit tests first and then writing the code to make it pass is called TDD -- Test Driven Development. You saw this in action in the code you just submitted, didn't you?<n><n>Now you have seen code with real unit tests -- not just sample unit tests. The code that was just submitted had unit tests as well as code and it had to satisfy the tests.<n><n>Now we will talk about how to test and validate code in

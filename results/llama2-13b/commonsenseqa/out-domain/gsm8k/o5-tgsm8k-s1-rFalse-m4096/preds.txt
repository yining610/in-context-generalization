Each year, they always vacationed near a different beach and each year, the exact same day, the man would go out for a drive and stop at a small country store that was within biking distance (approximately 5 miles) of his hotel.  One year, he decided to take a stroll from his hotel to the country store and noticed a sign that said, “All Bikes For $200.”  He thought he should try his luck and check out the bikes.  There was one large bike that had many different parts that were all a little loose, but the bike would work if he could find those small pieces and tighten them enough.  Once he took the bike home, the man discovered he could not put on the bike’s front wheel because the pedal had come off from the front axle and was too long to fit through the small circle of the front axle.  With his own tools, he was able to find a few screws with a smaller threaded head so he could adjust the pedal’s length around the axle and then the wheel was able to spin when he rotated the pedal.  He then decided to take it out for the test ride he had been waiting to do for years and he noticed only then that the handlebar grips had not fit on the handlebars and the seat had no padding at all.  His wife would have gotten a new bike and left him at the store, but by this time he had spent his

And if you want to learn more about `Input and Output` (especially `user input`), you can read this article [Read user input (Keyboard input) in python](https://towardsdatascience.com/read-user-input-keyboard-input-in-python-e9a278dcd3e4)<n><n>For the second part, it's similar to the first part, so I won't bother to write about it.<n>And for the last part, you should check the input format again.<n><n>For example: The last example question you might be more familiar with, because it's similar to a math competition.<n><n>The answer here could be **1**.<n><n>For example, if we add $20 + $2 = $22<n><n>if there were some $2 left, it would be $2 less than the total value of the question, so it would be $0.<n><n>In this example, $2 was spent, so we have $2 less than the answer we want, which is $6. So, we'll only get $4, and then we still need to go shopping for **$15**.<n>

This assignment is to give you an opportunity to practice:<n><n>>  * using arrays to solve a problem from Scenarios<n>>  * using basic data structures (such as arrays, maps, strings, etc.) to understand and solve computational problems, i.e., problems about processes or computations. You’ve hopefully been solving computational problems throughout your coursework at Cal.<n>>  * using data structures to store data to be processed, manipulated, or used<n><n>### Scenario 1:<n><n>1. We have an array `colors` and you want to remove an element from the array, then reorder the elements so the remaining elements shift up as that element is removed. <n><n>**Explanation**: This is the simplest example of when you might want to remove an element and use the array to remember where the other elements have moved so you can recreate the array. <n><n>**Code**: You should end up with this function definition:<n><n>```ruby<n>def reorder_array!(colors, position, element)<n>```<n><n>2. You’re removing the green element from the previous array, and the resulting array is:<n><n>```ruby <n>colors = ["blue", "gray", "green", "red"]<n>```<n><n>You do not need to change the colors array yourself. Instead, use the array as an additional helper variable. <n><n>3. You should return an array `new_array` with a single element in it (the blue element):<n><n>```ruby<n>    new_array = ["blue"]<n>```<n><n>4. You can change the color array to `blue` afterwards. <n><n>**Example**:<n><n><n><n>```ruby<n>colors = ["blue","gray","green","red"]<n>new_arr = ["blue"]<n>puts new_array <n>#=> ["blue"]<n>``` <n><n>**Bonus:** You now should understand how to use

A pound (lb.) is 0.4536 kg.  18 inches is 0.46 meters.   0.46 / 0.454 is 0.996.<n><n>So the bench gets 0.460 kg = 4.536 X 0.995 (0.45 X 0.95) = 4.4985 kg.  Then 290 lb. is 130.2 kg.  4.498 kg  + 130.4 kg is 134.88 kg.  That is 1348800 g, or 1348.8 mg,  or 134.9 g, or 0.135 kg.  Since we are measuring change over time, the man's weight does not change (ignoring the change associated with sitting), so the man's weight change is 0.<n><n>Thus the bench drops 0.134 kg - 0.130 kg = 0.004 kg = 0.4 kg.  Or 50 milligrams, or 500000 micrograms<n><n>Explanation 2, just ignoring the weight of the man: 290 lb (131.5428635 kg) times 0.18 (18/100) is: 47.6142863 kg.   Since 18 inches is 46 cm, 47.62 cm is the total height of the bench.  So 18 inches is -47.6 cm, or -0.476 cm.<n><n>##### Instructions:Answer the following multiple chioce question.<n><n>Input : Which of the following is an example of a chemical change?<n>    Choices:<n>  A. water into water v

Calculate the number of pizzas that can be ordered using combinations of the following toppings.<n><n><n>1. Anchovies<n>2. Bacon<n>3. Bell Pepper<n>4. Hot pepper<n>5. Mushrooms<n>To order a pizza, put the toppings in the order the pizza will be delivered.<n><n>For example, an order of “B, A” will result in Bacon delivered first and then anchovies.  Pizza ordered using this method may have multiple flavors of “B” and/or “A” on the same pizza. The sequence and order matter. However, the placement of the toppings on the pizza (top or bottom of the pie) is irrelevant. In a similar example, an order of A, B, means the pizza would be topped with a single layer of anchovies, bacon,and then a layer of both toppings.<n><n>Order “B, A, B” is equivalent to “A, B, A, B.”<n><n>All combinations have the possibility of being ordered.  For example, the topping combination of Pizza:B, B, A, A, B, A, is possible. The same pizza can be ordered as B, B, A, or A, A, B.  However, no single pizza can be ordered multiple times.<n><n>The answer should include the number of combinations and also the number of different pizzas.<n><n><n>### Explanations you might find useful<n><n>Pizza A = B + C, Pizza B = B + C, and Pizza C = B + C<n><n><n>To find the number of combinations, it helps to find the number of permutations. Because the number of permutations does not matter for this problem, only the number of combinations will suffice.  The order of toppings does not matter in this problem, as long as they are ordered together and there are no repeating topping combinations. The following is the formula to find combinations<n><n>combinations (A, B, C) = (combinations (A)) x (combinations (B)) x (combin-ations (C))<n><n>To find the combinations, we have to add up the number of unique orders.

The total number is 92. We subtract 7 stickers from 89 sticker and get 82. So Mary used 82 stickers. After that, Mary has 92-82=10 sticker leftovers.<n><n>For Question Zach, We know that Zach have 65 dollars already. Then Zach will get a extra 10 bucks from his parents. Now we know that he will get 70 dollars. After that, Zach work for 2 hours and gets 14 bucks. Then Zach earns 84 dollars. Then Zach needs 100+65=165. Zach needs 6 dollars more to earn before he buy a bike.<n><n>For Question Mark, I think Mark got X number of kangaroos, and X times 3 times more goats. Then I multiply 23 goats by X times 3.Then Mark has 3 times X goats, and 23 kangaros. Then I add 23 kangars + 3X * 2 = 23+6X = 23 + X = X + 23(X+3 =X). Then there are only 23(X-1) goats. Then we write it as X-123 goats. Then I add 3*23 = 69 goats. After that, I add X+2

Write down all the variables and any helpful equations.<n>2. In order to find the answer, you must first translate the word problem into a mathematical equation.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>To answer the first question, we should make a few assumptions with some simple math to set things up: Mary has 89 stickers<n><n>We are told that 3 large stickers were used on the cover, 7 were used individually on other pages and the<n>  rest are all small stickers.<n>  Using the above setup, we can derive three total equations:<n>  L<n>   + 7(S<n>   + S<n><n>3)                      == 89 <n>   3<n>   - 5 <n><n>4)                               <n>   2<n>   - 5<n><n>5)                       <n><n>1) is just saying that 12 stickers were used in total. You can easily see from the numbers that this is a 1:3 ratio between the amount of larger and smaller stickers used.<n><n>2) is saying that Mary used 3X amount of larger stickers per individual amount of smaller stickers used. Since she had 89 stickrs, this means she used 89/26 larger stickers. Since we know the ratio, we can see that larger sticker usage is a 3:1 ratio.<n><n>3) is going from amount of small stickers to amount of larger stickers. Since 12 was the total amount of stickers used, you can see that 5, or half, of this was made up of smaller stickers. The larger stickers used was 3 times that of the smaller stickers, so half of 3 times 5 is also 3.<n><n>4) just follows from 2) and 3) since if you had 6 pages (7*6), then you can see that she is using 1 small sticker per 6 pages. If she is using 1/6th of the total amount of stickes to put on other pages, then it follows that she is using 6 times as many small stickers than the overall amount of stickers. Also, remember that it's 1X the number of larger stickers used per individual smaller stickers used. You can see that if you divide

Choices: New York, NewYork<n>  London<n>  Paris<n>Output: Paris<n>##### Solution:<n>The first method that popped in my mind was to simply use the modulus operator %. Given that the input is all in integers we can use `floor()` after to remove the decimal portion. Now we can calculate the percentage of each input:<n>```<n>val res = new ResonseParser(Array(true, true, true, false))<n>val input = InputParser(res.getInputs)<n>val inputPiece : Array[String] =  input.getInput(input.length-1.toString)<n>inputPiece.map(a => {<n>    val r = (a.length*10).toInt<n>    val k = a.charAt(0).toString<n>    val v = k.toInt*Int.MaxValue<n>    val rt = r % v<n>    rt % v<n>  })<n>```<n>The only method I could find that takes an integer and gives the remainder once divided by another integer is `remainder(b: BigInt, c: BigInt)`.  You don't always have floats around so it was necessary, but it does get the job done.<n>My next attempt was to get all the input in an array from the `InputParser` in a single line, then pass it to the `getRemainder` function. It will use `split` function to split the String based on the character `\,` and return the answer in an array that will contain the string '0' if there is no remainer. Finally the `getRemainner` function will simply calculate each element in that array and add `BigInt` into the next `inputPiece` array:<n>```<n>def getRemainder(input: Seq[String]) = {<n>    input.map(a => (a.split("\,")):_*)<n>    a.filter(_!= 0)<n>  }<n>```<n><n>I know there's a better way to get the input in a sequence in a single

Also I got a question on how I would explain to a child what I am passionate enough to code. I answered that coding is like math for all the future generations and how it is going to shape our world to make it a better place. Also I did a problem solving session, where we were given a problem (in which we need to find out how many chickens are there in the farm if we have 4 chicken thieves) and we would write a code to solve it and then, they will try to modify the code and find out how the code will work.<n><n>My interviewer was really generous as he gave me more time to work out one problem which was difficult for me. But I did it and he encouraged me that it is not so hard for me.<n><n>The questions that I worked during the interview were -<n><n>1. Given a string, how many number of times does the alphabet 'a' appears in a string? [Input: string = "AaAaAAAbBbb" Output : 7]<n>2. Given a string, return a new string of all characters (except the first two) appear in reverse and second element of each tuple. eg: "aabb" would yield "abb"<n>3. Given a string, check whether it contains only consonant or only vowel or both consonants and vowels or none but exactly 10 characters.<n>eg: "bbbbbbbbc" -> vowels, "aabbbaaa" -> consonant<n>

All that we're doing in Code 401 is making sure your Javascript is better for real users. How you answer the questions in this course are how you make your website look good for the users. Before we can get started, we have to go over a couple of new things: loops, if else statements, and functions.<n><n>First of all, we have to make our code better. How do we make our code better? With conditionals. <n><n>### Conditionals<n><n>Before we can get started with coding, let’s talk about what conditionals are.<n><n>In English, whenever we talk about conditions or anything related to a condition, it's always a statement that relates to yes or no, right and wrong, etc. <n><n>For example, conditionals can be statements such as whether this code works correctly or not, or if this code breaks or not. It can also be a simple as whether a user clicks on a part of the website or not.<n><n>We can use conditionals in JavaScript to check what is happening in that particular section of the website or what the user is doing with the website.  There are three conditions we can use.<n><n>If-else-if<n><n>Let's say we want to add more questions to our quiz on Codecademy.  We do this by adding another option.

We need to store key-value pairs based on the days of the week. This adds another requirement to check and add 2 more if statements <n>    - Q4-6: Here we are using dictionaries to store key-value data pairs in a format that uses a string and value as the key and a string as the value. Here the questions asks to make the solution work for multiple pages of data.<n>        In order to do so, we need to store the data from each page and then access our data-type in order to access the appropriate pages. This may sound confusing but, in the real-world where you have an extremely large amount of data and need to access it with a minimal amount of code and time, using a dictionary makes a lot of the problems much easier to solve.<n>        <n>If you are following along with the course, this is a good example of the "Why" to using a particular data-structure over another. In order to answer this set of questions correctly, you would also have to understand why we are using a dictionary.<n><n>In an interview, understanding the "Why"

Question 2: Zach needs to make an extra $6. Question 3: Since 2 legs/animal, he needs to total all animals' legs: 23 + 3x23 = 79. Question 4: 20.00 - 10 - 2 = 7.00. Question 5: Need to average 295 as they did 9700 before. Thus average is 12,500 / 9 round / 4 player = 295.67. Minus one less than the round average is 285 (since they already did it) 12,5 - 4x285 = 460. Question 6: D [curry], since Seatle refers to the city.<n><n>Answer: Answer to number 1:

Mary did not live long enough to graduate.<n>Output: Answer: B: All of Mary's schools are likely to be very close to each other<n><n>Output: I will give you a problem that can be solved by a person who has never done it before or solved it before. A man goes to work by his train which comes at 8:00 am and returns around 3 pm. On one day while coming back with 5 of his friends he noticed that among the 10 they were carrying 40 kg of weight. He then wondered that, what is the average daily weight that he carries with himself to work per day? Answer: Answer: It is clear from this puzzle that the man carries 5kg with him throughout the day. What happens in this puzzle is that the man doesn't have the idea of the weight with himself per day from the previous day. That is why he assumed that each of his friend carries the same weight. Thus, you can say that the average weight that the man carries per day is (5*5)/10 = 2.5 kg.<n>

Choices:  A: conduct trial B: arrest C: bring in verdict D: pass sentence E: serve justice<n>Output:		D<n><n>A judge passes sentence on an offender convicted of a crime. This sentence is usually a prison term. But it can also be a fine, probation, community service or a combination of prison time and these other sanctions known as sentencing alternatives.<n>  <n>Whenever anyone is charged with an offence and pleads guilty or is convicted of an offence, the prosecutor will typically ask for some sanction. It's the judge's job to determine the sentence using a set of tools called the "principles of sentencing." For some offenders, the judge will order a sentence "in accordance with the law," which means it is the same as a previous offence of a similar nature. In some cases, the judge has to take the judge's guidelines (called "normative sentencing") into consideration. The guidelines also tell the judge when it is appropriate to give lesser or more severe sanctions.<n><n>Whenever possible, the judge will also use the "philosophy of sentencing" as a guide. This means the judge will try to ensure the sentence fits both the offender's and the offence in mind. The judge is guided by a number of factors, including the offender's age, the level of remorse, personal circumstances, criminal record, as well as the consequences of the crime on victims.<n><n>**More information:** http://www.judicial.gc.ca/eng/judges-and-the-system/the-canadian-justice-system/what-judges-do/whattjudg/?search_text=Sentencing<n><n><n><n>

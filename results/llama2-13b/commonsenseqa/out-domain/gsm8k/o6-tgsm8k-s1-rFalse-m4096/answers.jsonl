Use the table to help you.\n\nMoney can be exchanged for goods and services called things. Things are grouped into categories. Some of these categories include shoes, groceries, and toys. It can cost money to do these things. Many people must work to earn money, but there are other ways to get money. When people make their own money from money that someone else has earn, that money is called income.\n\n### You Have No Money at this Time\nYou have a total of $0. You have the option to buy or sell in a stock market or by investing in a bond with a guaranteed return or by renting out some of your old things. Each of these options has a different return rate. See the table below:\n\n| Option | Return Rate |\n| ------------ | ------------ |\n| Rent Out | 400% |\n| Bond | 200% |\n\n### Return Rate Descriptions\nReturn rates explain what will happen to your money if you have a positive or negative balance for each option. A positive balance explains what happens when you have more money than you started with. For example, if you put $20.00 in each option that has a positive return rate, you will earn more money. In most cases you will earn it twice as fast or four times as fast. You will not lose more than the amount you started with in any of these options. Let's check it out with some examples. Let's say that you buy $20.01 of bonds and they have a return rate of 20%. This means in 28 days your account will be worth $24. You will have spent $20.02, but gained 40 cents. This makes your profit 2%. Here are the other examples:\n\n| Amount Invested | Bond Return (%) | Days | Amount Left |\n| --------- | --------- | ------------ | -------- |\n| $20.0 | 20% | 8 | $24 |\n| $26.01 | 20% (1 day) | 7 | $33.64 |", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

The if statement checks for a number input between 0 and 2 and returns a message. The elseif statement checks for a number that lies between numbers 3 and 5. It multiplies the number by 6 and returns the result (result of 8 will be 5*6=30). The else statement checks whether there was an input between numbers 6 and 8 and returns a message saying this number is not between 3 and 8.\n\nThe if-else statements use logical conditions like less than, greater than, ==, etc to check for different values.\n\n#### Solution Code:\n```\n# write your code h...\n```", "answer": "A: apply for job"}

If the calculations in the parenthesis are reversed, it might give the wrong answer. For example, 8 / 4 is 2, but when we reverse the parenthesis to *4/8 it becomes 1/2 because it performs the action within the parentheses with reversing the operations.\n\n**Q4** : **6 + 20 \u2013 10 = 18,** 15 * 1.25 = 18.75, so 3 is the result.\n\n**Note: A minus sign is a subtraction and a minus in front of a number is a negative.**\nFor example: 50 -4 = 46 and -4*6 = -24 when we want to subtract the negative signs.\n\n**Q5** : We can calculate this problem by looking at three different ways.\n\n1).

This means if the number is 0, to place our 15 in 2nd place\n\n### Step:2\n\nThen we can take this a step further and see if there is a pattern of some kind.\n\nTaking a look at the pattern, we have `n (0 - n), n * 5 (+- n), n * 20 (+- n)`\n\nThis can be simplified as: `n (0 - (n+4)), n * 5 + 5, n * (200 + n)`\n\nThe (200 + N) makes sense now, and that is your nth digit. Therefore `n (0 - N), N+500, 200N`\n\nOur `N` variable is 10 at `n=10` so we have our final answer: 16.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/4o7F7g6U4qIzR6m9bI\"></iframe><p><a href=\"https://giphycdn.com/media/4o7F06s0fvX3r2qZlA/source.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View GIF</a></p>\n\n</P>\n\n\n\n\n\n##", "answer": "A: mouth"}

If he played 36 minutes in total, what points did he average for the entire game if averages are rounded to the nearest whole number?\nOutput: 9\n\nAnswer: First, we are told that the player averaged 16 points in the first three quarters, 12 points in the last quarter, 16 points in three quarters, equals 32 points in three quarters. 12 divided by 32 is 38%, so in three quarters, the player scored \n38% of a total expected amount. He did not play in the last quarter, and we are told that he played \n15 minutes, so we are told that \n26% of that total amount, the 38%, was for that quarter. We can take it from this that this \n26% must be part of a 40% total, as \n26% out of 40% is 10.4, so 32 points in the first three divided by 40 plus 10.4 in the last divided by 40 is\n\n9 per point in three quarters and 10.4 per point in the last \n16 or a quarter in total.\n\nInput: During the first three quarters a basketball player averages 11 points 1 rebounds\nand 4 assists per quarter. In the last quarter the player only played 10 minutes before subbing out.  During the last quarter the player averaged 2 rebounds 2 points and 5 assists per game rounded to the nearest whole.

What is the difference between an array and a list?\n\nAn array is a collection of similar items while a list is a generic sequence of objects.\n\n\n### Why is it a bad idea to use array and list interchangeably?\n \n  It is a bad idea to use arrays and lists interchangeably because array is designed for a single type element while a list is generic and can store different kind of objects.\n\n### What is the difference between a linked list and sequential list?\n\nA linked list is like a stack of blocks and a sequential list is just a vector.\n\n\n## 3. What do integers do for us?\n\nAn integer is defined as a whole number. An integer is a number that includes the entire number line, including zero, positive and negative integers. For example, 11,793636 is an integer. Floats, decimals and fractions are not considered integers.\n\n## 4. What is the difference b/n a function that doesn't change the argument vs function that changes an arg?\n\nFor example, a function f(x) = x^2 returns the quadratic value of x.\n\n## 5. What does it mean to be a \"higher order\" function?\n\nA function, that is higher order, does not need to be passed in a parameter to work.\n\n\n##6. Why use the yield keyword?\n\n    The yield keyword is used to create a new method that will repeatedly iterate over a list until a stopping condition is met.\n\n### Question: What data type would be best for this code?\n\nThis statement will add 2 integers, then print out the sum.\n\n        def addInt(a, b)\n            a = a + b\n            puts a\n            end\n\n##6. What happens to an empty range?\nAn empty range is used to define a sequence of indices, but if the sequence is empty, it indicates that the sequence has zero elements.\n\n##7. 8. What is the difference in the order of operations in python?\n\n```\n         def a\n        if true\n            return 'true'\n        elif\n        else\n        if false\n            return 'false'\n        end\n```\n\n## 8.9.

If so, how did you approach them?\n\nThere was indeed a couple of questions I had never seen before. The question that stumped me the most was about eggs due to the complicated estimation involved with that question. However, I managed to get to the right answer in the end with the help of my classmate.\n\n* Do you notice any patterns to the difficulty of the questions?  Can you explain what they are?\n\nYes, the questions before midterm examination and after the midterm are different in difficulty. Before the examination, the questions were very easy and would sometimes involve primary operations. However, after the examination, the difficulty level of the questions seemed to increase by a small margin.

Quebec\nOutput: Option A: Calgary\n\nInput: 34 +- 8\nOutput: 26\n\n### Discussion & Answer\n\nThe correct answer is Option D : (44, 8*7, 5)\n\nThis is a typical example of a problem that can be done with **Linear Combinations**.\n\nThe way I would do this is that I would first simplify the equation(in Python).\n\nIn this example, Mary is left with 89 stickers, so the answer must be less than 89.  After simplifying the equation, 44 is the only output that satisfies our condition.\n\n```python\ninput('Enter the number of Stickers Mary has remaining: ')\n\nstickers = eval(input(\"Enter the number of stickers: \"))\n\npage1 = int(input(\"Enter the numbe of stickers for the front page: \"))\npages = int(input(\"enter the number of pages: \"))\n\n\nfinal_stickers = stickers-page1*7-pages*3\n\nprint(final_stickers)\n```\n\nAnother good way to get the result is to use **Modulo Operator**.\n\n**Modulo Operator** is also known as **Remainder Operator**.  It returns the remainder from the division of its arguments.\n\nThe first argument is the **dividend**, the second argument is the **divisor**.  The operator can operate on the number of digits in the first argument. The **modulo operator** is usually written as `%`.  In this example, the answer is `89 %7`.\n\nThis is the same as simplifying by *7* first and then by *pages*, which is *7/3* = *2* *pages*.\n\n\n### Challenge\n\n**Issues**:\n1. Simply reading the answers from the input and print out is not solving problems.  I must learn to **solve problems.**\n2. It is not possible to write everything in Python, so the key is to convert those complex situations into simple", "answer": "A: middle east"}

There are three stages in the sales process: Deal Creation, Active and Finalizing. The company consciously focuses on two kinds of metrics - Deal Rate and Deal Speed across these stages.\n\nThe Deal Rate is defined as the percentage of total deals created per person per week (including sales associates and sales managers). Deal Rate = (created deals / total number of people * week length)\n\nThe Deal Speed is defined as the amount of time in days that passes from a deal being created to the deal moving to the next stage. The process of moving from one stage to another is manual. This is called as Active Period. Finalizing Period starts when a deal is moved to Finalizing Stage and the amount of time it takes for a deal to reach the Finalizing Stage is referred to as Finalizing Period.\n\nZipline tracked these metrics for all sales associates and salesmanagers for the year 2021. We have information on Deal Rate and Active Period for the following week 11 (from March 1-7) for the sales associates and sales manager.\n\nIn Zipline, sales managers manage deals created by their sales associates. So, each sales manager\u2019s Active Period consists of the Active Period from their sales associates\u2019 created deals.\n\n### Instructions: Use the above information to answer the questions listed below.\n\n1\\.

By using `\\w` instead of `[a-z]` you're telling Python to use the built-in [word boundary regular expression `\\B`](https://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html). This uses the [Boyer-Moore algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm) to optimize the regex's performance.\n\\item When you get to the point in the program where you don't understand how something works, start by searching through the documentation. For instance, Python's documentation of `re.search` [starts here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), and this section specifically talks about the built-in [Boyer-Moorer optimization](https://docs.pythonsprint.org/3/re.search.html#optimizations).\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: In your code, you use `^a+b+$` to match 'Ab' and 'baa", "answer": "D: christmas tree"}

How many stickes does Maru have remaining?\nOutput. 44\n---\n### Solution:\n#### 1. Let's take a step back and write out the problem.\nThe problem states  Mary had 89  stickers.  She bought  3 large  stickers on the front  page of her journal,  but also used other stickers to 6 other  pages of her journal. Therefore, let's rewrite the question as:\n$$89-3=86$$\nHow many stickers does Mary has remaining?\n#### 2. Can we solve for our variables?\nIn this case, we are not sure what Mary \"used\" the rest of them on. However, we do know that  Mary has 86  stickers remaining.\n#### 3. Let's plug in our numbers into the formulas.\n##### Step 1:\nPlug in our solution.\n$86 = (7 \\cdot 86))$\n\n##### Step 2:\n\nSolve.\n$860 = 608$\nNow that we have a final answer,  lets plug and chug.\n$46 = 860-608$\nTherefore, Mary has 44 stickers remaining.\n\n#### 4. How do we know our answer is correct\nWe know that Mary used  $7 \\cdot 8=60$  stickers out of these $86$ to adorn each other six pages. However, out of these $89$  stickers we used  $3$  extra  $=27$  stickers.\n\n#### 5. Try again\n- Mary had 5  stickes.  She bought  50  stickes and 2  sticks for her cat. How many stickes were left to decorate her journal?\n$$100-2=98$$\n\n#### 6. Take notes\n$$\\begin{array}{}\n86\\cdot7  =\\text {(1)}\\\\\n27\\cdot2   =\\text {(2)", "answer": "A: friend's house"}

As soon as I had my variables set with the input amounts and then I created the variables with either an integer (23) or float(1.25). I then knew how the code would turn out and what amounts to ask for or put into the code.\n# ## Step4: I had to keep practicing and going up and down finding the answer for the amount I gave input until I finally got the correct answer for the problems. Once I got one correct answer, I was able to use that information to solve the next one as well.\n# ## Step5: I had to go to the internet and find out the correct format for each of the inputs so I can start to put the right input in order for the right output to return.\n# ## Step6: With this, I was able to get all of the right inputs and outputs and see how each piece of code works for the values that I have input. If these values didn't work, I would know to keep trying others until a correct outcome was achieved.\n# # ### This is my First time doing Python and trying these type of problems and this is My First", "answer": "B: health department"}

I would like that someone would share some knowledge about the questions that I am answering.\n\nAnswer: Let's see, shall we?\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item If you are given a number as an input and it is required that you get a certain answer, you can loop while it is not equal to \\begin{code}\n<what_you_want>\n\\end{code}.\n\\item If you get multiple inputs, you should put them in an array. Then you should `if`, `or`, `and` them as needed.\n\\item If you have a situation in which the inputs have specific relationships, you can write a conditional that will test if those relationships are correct.\n\\item If the inputs are required to be sequential, you can assign them in the loop for easy testing.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: Thank you so much! However, I am just wondering if any of you have any knowledge about using a class to make the program more efficient. The code that I posted has the 8 different questions and I would like to make different classes for each question.\n\nComment: I agree. A class for each question is ideal. The `input` is a variable, however, so it makes a difference whether you want to keep that in a variable or not. If you do, you would also need to add in a separate program or call to set the value of input. I would probably recommend making the class, but not make input anything special.\n\nComment: @ZachChao if an answer helped you, please consider to mark it as accepted\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nI", "answer": "D: gym"}

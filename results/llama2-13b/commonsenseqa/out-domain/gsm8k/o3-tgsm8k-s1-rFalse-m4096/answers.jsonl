Sam always calls heads and Fred always calls tails. \n\nThey each have six coins on their side of a table with which to play a coin-tossing game. The game is that every time a win occurs, the man who calls it wins a coin from the other. If a win goes uncall, then neither man wins anything and another coin-toss occurs.\n\nSince the men don\u2019t trust each other, Sam and Fred decide to play it so that the coins from the table will be split if there is a tie of five wins for one, five for the other, two wins for one, and three wins for the other, (four total wins by one and only two wins by the other).\n\nIn a match to the first ten wins with no ties, Fred wins with a total of one more win than Sam; it is possible Sam wins and Fred does not. How many coins does Fred have in the end?\nOutput:  Gambler: 36401", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

When the function runs it will find all the answers in the reference string, and return a list of strings where each answer is the first word of an answer string.  You will need to put the correct answer into the answer list in the same order as it was asked in the input string.\n\nThe function will have two special values as input parameters.  The first one (called 'AnswerFlag' should be True if the entire list has been found.  It will be False if it was not found.  \n\nThe second special value (called \"StopFlag\" should be set to True if after processing that special value you want the function to exit.  It should be set to False if the special string is not the last special string in the input string.  \n\nThe default input for the first special value is that you should not use this, the second default for the special value is to allow you to just look for the first special value.\n\nWhen you have finished this exercise, go and do it again. Now, instead of finding the answers, you will need to match them in the same order by the same number of word for words and for the same number of letters.  You will need some help from your partner to help you do that!\n### Note:This is", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

Can he learn pig latin? Let's find out!\nMy dog is very smart. Can he learn pig-latin? Let's find-out!\n**Output:** My dog is very smart can he learn pig Latin\n### Solution: In pig Latin, a word's initial syllable is moved to the end of the word.  If the word begins with a consonant, a \"ay\" is added to the end of it. Examples:\n```\npig Latin (without ay)\n\nspay      ayspay   \"space\"\npyc        apyc      \"pick\"\n```\n\nIn pig Latin, the \"initial\" syllable is moved. \"Initial\" here means the syllable that comes first after the word is split at hyphens or spaces. Thus, \"My\" becomes \"My-\", the syllable \"my\" would be after both of the hyphens in your example.\n\nLet's do it from the beginning. The word \"dong\" becomes \"dong-ay\", not \"do nay\" with \"nay\" being the syllable after \"do", "answer": "D: relaxation"}

Of course there was an element of randomness with regards to whom likes it.  This is often the case in real life.  I would want to get some idea of if I should buy a ticket or not.  What is a good approach to do this? \nOutput: Ask everyone if they like it. Then calculate the average and then predict your chances if you're in the average group (like 24%). \n\nAnswer:\n\n1a. The answer must be rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n1b. The amount of money remains $4 ($100 - $96).\n\n1c. This has two parts: one for the legs of the animals, and the other to add up all the legs. 23 can be represented as 10k + 3. We can use kk to obtain 10k.\nWe get 23 = 10k +3 which is equivalent to 4 *k +3 =23. This gives us: k = 23 - 13 = 10, meaning the total number of legs for all the animals is 10 times 10, 100 legs.\n\n1d. We are dealing with two things here - the average that a person's choice is liked by other people and the average percentage of people that would like the movie. The average that a person' likes the movie is based on the 24 percent that like it. So, for each person, there is 23.75% chance that we like the movie.\n\nI know that this question is based on mathematics, stats, and logics.

But, the sum of the letter is a sequence (from odd letter to odd letters) is 1+3+7+15=26. Therefore, the sum of all the odd letter in the entire alphabet is: 53-26=17.  How many odd letters are in the English alphabet?\nOutput: 23\n\nINPUT: In the previous question the solution has been to find a sequence of letters that would bring the sum of the odd letters to zero.

{"idx": 781, "text": "bathtub\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: \\strong{Bug:} there are a few places where your code is reading things twice. For example\n\n\\begin{code}\n  int answer2 = in.nextInt();\n  int a = answer2;\n\\end{code}%\n\nand\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\begin{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{itemize}%\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nshould be\n\n\\begin{pre}\n    int answer2 = in.readInt();\n    int a = answer2 ;\n  \\item \\strong{Increment}: 1\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\end{code}\\\\*\n\nAs a side note there are several comments that suggest you know how this works. You really need to start writing the code like you would write English.\n\nWhen you read a String or an Integer the `read...` function stores it in a buffer (array). When you call a method it is used as a parameter - the method uses the value in the buffer the first time. `readInt` reads the integer and stores it in a buffer. `a = answer2` uses the \\em{same buffer}. Change the code so they use different buffers. For `readInt` use `answer2 = in.readInteger();`.\n\nFor the `enumerate` type questions. You could do something like\n\n\\begin{align}\nwhile ( in.hasNextInt )\n\\end{align}\n\nor\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n  in.readInt();\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{blockquote}%\n\nwhere you increment your counter based on the number read.\n\nYou might want to simplify it further. Consider using an `Integer` as your `counter` and just doing\n\n\\begin{block}\n while ( in.hasNext ){\n     enumerator.int( in.readInt() );\n }\n\\end{block}\n\nIt seems to answer the question the same as the original code, but it gets rid of a bunch of duplicated code and makes it easier to modify later if they add a new type of question.", "answer": "B: office"}

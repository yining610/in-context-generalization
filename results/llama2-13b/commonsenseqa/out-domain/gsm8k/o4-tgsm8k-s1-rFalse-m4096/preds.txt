If you are trying to do more advanced tasks (like programming), what tools or strategies do you use?<n><n>2. If you have a bad connection, how can you improve it? What are some free apps you use to maintain a connection or do work online?<n>### Answer:<n><n>1. I have to use older computer because I don’t have much money and I need to take care to make it work longer. I often download many programs to clean my computer.  I tried to download disk cleanup, which is an app for windows. Sometimes it works but sometimes it’s not useful to make computer run faster.  However, I just take care to the old computer by cleaning up the unnecessary files and take good care of this old computer.<n>In terms of programming task, I often get frustrated about my program whenever it’s not working well. So, the most valuable tip for me is to try to find the bug of the program. I always focus on one problem and go back to find the source of that problem rather than giving up on my problem.<n><n>2. If my internet connection is good, I just stay away from the router and keep it on the same side of the wireless device. I found it is good way to keep the signal strong.<n>For free app, I usually use chrome because it has many useful programs in one app such as youtube, google docs, and google hangouts. Also, the other benefit is that it can sync automatically whenever you have two devices such as phone and pc.<n><n>In order to use the internet, I don’t really use any app. I’m not really into using apps. However, if I have any important work or data, I save it on a usb stick or memory card.<n><n>## Questions for the Hackathon:<n>* How do you solve a problem as computer science students?(or what strategies do you use for doing the CS?)<n><n>**Answers:**<n><n>The most efficient way of solving the problem is, to focus on one problem at a time, break the problem down into small problems and try to find the solution to the small problems.<n><n>#### Q2.<n><n>* How do you decide which tools to use?<n><n>**Answer

One of the limitations of using a stack (LIFO) is that it doesn’t allow us to access the items that we’ve pushed into the stack from the back. We are only able to access the items that were pushed most recently to the stack.<n><n>We can combine a stack and a queue into a new data structure called a push-down stack. It stores each item in a separate node. This is represented by the two numbers that are stored in each node of the push-down stack.<n><n>We store the top two elements of the stack at the top of the stack.<n>We store the top element and the next element that is queued into the stack as a separate node below the two elements of the top of the stack.<br><n>The figure above shows how this push-down stack is organized. We call the number stored from the top of the stack as the peek element and the number to be queued into the stack is called the push element.<n><n>We use the peek element from the top of the two elements in the push-down stack as the next element in the queue. We do the same for the push element.<n>

This question is multiple choice and is looking for you to read a prompt and answer the multiple choice questions. This was super easy to do using spaCy. You have to read the question and separate the sentence, which is easy to do with spaCy.<n><n>The next step is to create the variable and give it a name, let's call the variable question so we can use it later. The next step is to create an empty list which I'll call choices. I'll have the choices as a list which contains other lists. This is where we store our multiple choice options. After you create the variable names choose question and the list of options you're ready to read the sentence and separate it.<n><n>To read the sentence we use sentence.text and I'll store my answer. I should also add that if sentence.text equals null then it's a different question format. If your questions are like the ones that are above then your text is in paragraph form like we learned in our previous section. Here are the sentences we're working on in this particular sample.<n><n>For the first question it's Mary had 89 which I converted to a number. The first sticker is large and it's on the front it's 3 so I'll take that number and add it to the answer, which is 40 in this case. The next part is she used which is a verb and next comes 7 and then the number 10 the number 10 is what she uses because she does other pages. I'll add 70 to 40 which gets me 110 and then 10, so 120. Mary had 89 so 89 and 120 and I'll add them to get the correct answer.<n><n>When I created the correct answer, if the answer equals 14 then it's correct but if it doesn't then the answer must be incorrect. For this question only one answer can be correct. For the second question there is no verb because it says on Friday, so Friday is a day, it's not a verb. The next word is weekly which is the first verb. It also gives you the amount of money it's weekly 5. The next word is and which we'll skip I don't think it is an important factor.

Each jewel's price is represented by a single integer. Some of the jewels are broken and have a price with a negative sign in front of the value. Since you don't want anyone breaking any jewels, a "broken" jewel is only worth what its value would actually buy you after accounting for the negative sign. For example, a valuable jewel would be worth -$100 because the owner would receive $-100. An "average" jewel is worth 3x the negative value (x=the number of negative signs in front), and a "cheap" jewel is -$100*10^9. Find all three values for which jewel has the highest price tag.<n>

The next step is to create the case with a missing digit, so we can find whatever is left over if we find the missing digit. <n><n>In the first scenario, we have '7' left with '83' so we can use the remainder function, with only the remaining digits, and a base of 10.  We also know that we have 4 digits to use. <n><n>```python<n>def remainder(num1, div):<n>    remain = num1 % div<n>    return str((remain // 10)) + str((remain % 10))<n>```<n>```py<n>print( remainder('83', '7') )<n>```<n>The above will output '8', which means we need 7 more.  So in total we have 15, since we know that our last digit is '3' we only need to figure out one extra digit.<n><n>With this in mind, we can create a scenario that is just one missing digit and try to solve it.<n><n>```py<n>print ( remainder('831', '7') )<n><n>print (remainder('423', '7'))<n>print(remainder('483', '7'))	<n>```<n><n>output: <n><n>```<n>'4237'<n>'4837'<n>```<n>	<n>The answer becomes 4237, but we know this because we know that both of our numbers are missing a '9'.  We can now make our program accept both cases. 		<n><n>We can now figure out that the remainer has not changed in digits and we can go back to our first statement and try it. <n><n>``` py<n>print ( remainder('981', '7')<n><n>print ( remainder('180', '7')<n>```<n>			<n>output: 1807, 9817<n><n>```py<n><n>def remainder(num, div):<n>    remain1 = num % 10 <n>    remain2 = num //

Choices:  A: finger B: good health C: own family D: friends E: people<n>Output:		C<n><n>#### Answer:<n><n>A person who has brown skin most likely shares it with his own family. This is due to DNA. If a person has brown skin,<n><n>><n>![DNA](https://via.placeholder.com/500x300/2ED447?text=DNA)<n><n>then he is more likely to share this skin color with his parents, brother, and sister. If one of his parents has brown skin though, then it most likely will be the mother. Because the mother is the one that passes on the mitochondrial DNA to the child. This is seen in genetic studies.<n><n>><n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below and explain your thinking.<n><n>Input: What are some ways you can apply your new knowledge to solve everyday problems?<n>#### Answer:<n>I have done something that uses my new knowledge by playing a game on code.org called Kodable.

So why is their relationship mostly one of cooperation rather than competition? According to a new study, that's because they've evolved in different patterns and at different speeds.<n>**Although bears** ** and wolves** ** are both prey upon animals such as rabbits and rodents, their natural environments are very different, which has led them to develop differently, the researchers said. It turns out some animals evolve quickly and some don't, and these differences, more than genetics, drive which individuals and species coexist happily in the same environment, or end up competing instead.<n>**The researchers** ** used computers to model how prey individuals and species diversify across the landscape at different speeds, and how predators then adapt or avoid them. The model made two predictions: First

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: 322<n><n>Input: Josh’s mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall. He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?<n>Output: 3<n><n>Input:The lady was getting worked up about the article explaining the uptick in accidents in their area, but her husband was dismissive of it stating that accidents what? Choices:  A: happen to people B: hurt people C: happen anytime D: happen often E: happen anywhere<n>Output:		All of the above<n><n>### Solution to each problem:<n><n>1. Let’s keep track of all the stickers used with a `total_used` variable, for example if we used `total_used = 3 + 7 = 10`. Then we can find `remaining = 89 - 10 = 79`<n><n>2. By looking at how Zach’s allowance will add to his savings, we can add the $10 for mowing the lawn to the weekly allowance for 5 weeks to make $50, for example $5 + ($10 * 5) = $50. Then we can find how many $7 babysitting payments are left by subtracting that sum from the bike price, i.e. $100 - $50 = $50. Finally, with two hours of babysitting on Saturday we can find out that he has $10 more left to save by taking $7 * 2 = $14 and subtracting that from $50: $50 - $14 = $36. So, together Zach needs to save $36 more before buying the bike.<n><n>3. Let’s keep a running total of the legs as we add more kangaroos and more goats. Kangaroos have 2 legs per animal. Goats have 4 legs per animal. <n> * 23 kangaroo legs = x + 2 * x = 4x<n> * 3 times as many goats = 3x<n> * 2(4x) = 8x<n> * 8x + 4x = 12x<n> * 12x<n><n>4. After buying a hat for $1 and a pencil at $2, Josh has $18 left. So, when buying four cookies at $1.25 each, that would be 18*1.25 = 22.50 = 23$. But we need to have extra for tax. For example 23 + 19.5% = $28.00<n><n>5. A and B are correct<n><n>### Python code:<n><n>Answer (1).<n><n>```<n>print ("I have {} sticker remaining".format(89-

Then I made a dataset and trained the model to find the best model. Then with the predictions, I compared the data set with the prediction and finally after checking the accuracy(accuracy percentage), I was able to select the proper model.The selected model was used to train the new model and make predictions on that data set.<n><n>### Results:For the question which have the choice option, the data set gave four options and the predicted answer only have one choice option. Hence I was unable to determine in this case which choice option is the correct one.I used the accuracy metric to assess whether the model correctly selected the correct answer of which there is only one choice or not.In order to overcome this obstacle, I provided that these questions can only be answered if there is only one choice among the four given options.After making this altercations in the data set, the algorithm showed the following accuracy score.<n><n>

This project is about learning to use Haskell, so you should understand this.  Do you understand the language from these examples?  Do you understand the assignment?<n><n>Comment: Please try and follow the conventions for formatting code -- indentation levels of 8 spaces is one convention, but a consistent convention is useful to both the question-answerer and the reader of the question.  I've fixed up your questions to provide this consistency.<n><n>Comment: I've removed the [tag:functional-programming] tag, since it is mis-use since it's misleading.  It doesn't mean you're using functions (every program uses functions - even in C), but it means you're programming in the functional-programming paradigm.  For example, Haskell is a functional language, but other functional languages exists, so does functional programming in these other languages.  I've also removed the [tag:syntactic-sugar] tag since it makes no sense.<n><n>Comment: Thanks I agree that the questions are still hard, but I think the examples on the wiki should help a lot.  In this section of the wiki: https://github.community/wiki/Data-structures, you will see that a Haskell list is similar to an array.  You can imagine your program using a single list variable to represent the sequence of numbers.  You will also see this list variable is an array, but how you use it is different from array usage in C.  I think once you understand this, some of the questions in the test are much simpler.  Happy coding.<n><n>Comment: So I’ve added in both versions of the code because if you use that for testing purposes and change your code the test will fail. If you want to

To do this we first need to find the amount of stickers Mary has, so then we will be able to find the remaining stickers. To find the amount of sticklers Mary has, we multiply the amount of sticklars she has by the amount of times she placed sticklars each and every page she worked(this means 7 for 6 pages). So, we can find the answer by doing 89*7, which will end up giving us 613 staylars. So, to find the answer we need to take out the three large she placed on one page. So, by taking out these three sticklers, we end up getting the correct answer of 46 stickler. This is why the solution to this problem is A.<n><n>### Examples of A:<n>### Example 1<n>`10*7 = 70`<n>`0*3 - 70 = -60`<n><n>### Exmaple 2<n>`10*8 = 80`<n>`3*3 - 80 = -77`<n><n>### If there are 6 items in a bag, there are 6 items left in the bag.<n><n>### This problem is almost exactly the same as the previous problem except in the previous problem we're finding how many sticklers Mary has, and in this problem we're trying to find how much money Zach needs to earn before he buys the bike<n>

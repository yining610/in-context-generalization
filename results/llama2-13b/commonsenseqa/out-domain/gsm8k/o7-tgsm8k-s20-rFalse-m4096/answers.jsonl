Accidents can imply actions, but they would have to involve moving your car, such as colliding with a moving object (parking lot poles, other cars).\nChoice C can't work because the question is missing an action verb. So I can't get any insight.\nChoice D can't work because driving the car is implied and is the action. You can't get tired of driving the car, so only E left.\n\nIn this second question, I realized the first sentence \"On Monday..\" can only mean that Monday is first day of events and this sentence refers to Tuesday. I would then look up how many hours per day he worked on Tuesday, which is 5.5 hours, and I can get rid of all the choices that do not equal this value. I would then look at the second sentence \"He worked 8 hours each..\" to see how many hours he worked on Wednesday. I then got one more time slot to work with and it's 45 minutes, which isn't that much. So I would use only 1 choice and see if I can apply the remaining hours. I can't on the first choice 8hrs and I used the other choices: 7.5hrs &7hrs.

The first function will print the number out in a format that can be easily searched as a substring for the numbers. The second function creates an initial list of sum, which is the accumulation of sum to the previous number calculated. Then it goes through printing out the number as a string, converting the numbers from the string, finding the numbers, adding the numbers to sum, and returning sum.

For instance, two years ago, as a newbie in the team, I was very excited to use every opportunity I could to show my strength and capability as a winger in the team. The training was tough and I did not manage my energy correctly during that practice. So, about ten minutes into the practice session, I was tackled by one of my senior players. I was overpowered and slid across the field. We were very busy and it was during that session, as I was rushing to get my body back onto the rugby pitch, that I landed badly. My two knees made contact with the ground, but the main hit occurred on my left knee. It was a huge pain and I couldn't get up. After getting checked by the trainer and the coach, the doctor told me not to continue the training. I was disappointed with my knee injury and my first thought was about getting my revenge on the player who had tackled me. \n\n### Instruction :Answer the following multiple choice questions.\n\nFill in the blank:\n\nThere was an accident,________?

These basic tasks are used in programming, which enables the computer to understand the commands of program, which will be written on various scripting and computer language. The Data Structures are used to store the information that requires the computer to perform basic tasks of calculation, searching, sequencing, sorting, and updating.\n\nData Structure is a collection of data, which is organized in a particular way, so that retrieval can be implemented on the basis of certain aspects or operations, that are performed on the same type of data set. Most of the Data Structure are implemented in the form of the variable, which stores the data in the way memory of the computer, that allows efficient access to the data at a given time.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two types of data structures used in the program are as follows:\n\n\n1. Stack\n2. Queue\n\n\n\n\n## 1. Stack\n\nA stack is a special type of data structure in which the last member insert into the queue. It is considered as the dynamic data structure. Stack data structure provides some common operations like Insert, Deletions, Peek, and Pop. Stack is a finite-length container of generic data items that supports a FIFO(first in first out) or LIFO(last in first out) access paradigm which allow the deletion of elements from the top and push items onto the top of the stack.\n\n```\nstruct node\n{\n    string item;\n    node *next;\n};\n```\n\nStack is a dynamic data structure as the memory requirements increase based on the number of data items inserted into stack. Stack uses the pointer to link items together in stack to form a chain, also referred to as a singly-linked list. It allows to add and remove items at one end of the chain without disrupting all the other items in the set. The two main operations of a stack are push and pop which are used to add and remove items stored in the stack.\n\nAdd an item in Stack\n\n    int stack[50], top=0;\n    string item; \n    cout << \"Add an Item in Stack:\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Enter an item: \"; cin >> item;\n    stack[top]", "answer": "D: room"}

Each bar has half the weight of a gold bar, with twice the price of $400.\n```python\nhalf gold bar is worth $400. Each gold bar has half the weight, but twice the price of $800, so we can subtract from $800 to get the answer.\n```\n\nThe price of a half gold bar equals $400, while two gold bars equals $600.\n```\n```python\n# Half gold bar", "answer": "C: every city"}

Each line after contains the full name of an employee; each name is no longer than 20 characters. No 2 names in a file are the same.\n\nMy code, first of all, reads the 1st line of the file, which contains the number of employees in the file. Then, if the number of lines in the file are less than the number of employees: it means that I am already over the 3rd line, which is the loop I do, because the first line would be the line I read in order to find the 20. So it prints the word Employee, then prints 'Not Enough Data', and stops.\n\nBut if the number of lines are greater or equal the number of employees in a company, I use another loop I define in order to count each line that is greater than a maximum number I give in the second loop (the one defined in the if statement). The maximum number is the 20th. So I print each line, but I print 'No Name' when I reach the last line, even though there's another line that is also above the maximum line number and that contains a real name. So how do I print only 'No data' if there's no employee and otherwise print the name? And what if I want to count each real name? I know I have to use another loop. How do I count each real name? What should I use, if?\n\n### Instructions:Read the following text, then answer the question below it.\n\n\"This is a sentence containing the word sentence.

I would like for it to weigh no more than 75 pounds. However, I cannot tolerate it if a TV includes this feature: a projection. It should have the function to be used outdoors. I do not want any TV that includes these features: a refrigerator. It needs to be usable in a hotel room, and be able to be used for gaming.

It has an LED, weighs less than 75 pounds, can be used outdoors, can be set up in hotels, has a built-in gaming system, can be mounted on a wall with no problems, has 3D support, and cannot have a fridge unit. Unfortunately, it cannot be portable. Thus, TV1 is a no-go. \n\n\nTV2 has a price of $500, which is a bit more than I wanted to spend. It is, however, portable, which makes it appealing.

We call integers in the sequence the roots of the problem.\n\nYou may assume that each individual member of the sequence has no more than 50 distinct digits and will fit in a 1000-byte array without exceeding any limits of your choice of programming language and platform. The sequence consists of integers between 1 and 10^7, inclusive.\nYou will never be given numbers that are 10^7 or larger.\n\nSuppose an integer t appears in the sequence that is a permutation of another integer x. That is, t and x have the same digits but they may be in a different order (for example, 12345 and 12346 are different permuations of each other; 1234 and 4123, however, cannot both be in the sequence at the same time because they are not permutations of each other).\n\nYou are given a list of integers L, and you must return a list of integers C, such that each member of C is a permutation of some member of L, and no two members of C are permutations of each other. \n\nFor example, suppose L = 1234, 1245, 1256, 2345, 2356.\n\nC would be an acceptable choice for the sequence 1256 because C = [1245,2356] and both integers are permutations of some integers from the list L.\n\n\nHowever, C = [2356,1245] is not acceptable because the sequence is not in the form required for the solution.\n\nGiven a sequence of integers how can I get permutations of the sequence?\n\n###Instruction:Answer the following question.\n\nInput(string):[1234,1245,1256,2345,2365]\n\nExpected output(list): [[1245,5541],[2356,3662],[5416,6346],[4163,1426],[3562,6200]]\n\nOutput: [4163", "answer": "C: bar"}

Choices:  A: towed B: accidents C: driving D: getting tired E: ticket<n>Output:		E<n><n>'''<n><n>Answer: In the first question I simply looked at each choice and ruled out those I knew did not work.<n><n>Choice A can't work because towed implies an action, so if you didn't move your car, you wouldn't get towed.<n><n>Choice B can't work because accidents don't make sense in this context. Accidents can imply actions, but they would have to involve moving your car, such as colliding with a moving object (parking lot poles, other cars).<n>Choice C can't work because the question is missing an action verb. So I can't get any insight.<n>Choice D can't work because driving the car is implied and is the action. You can't get tired of driving the car, so only E left.<n><n>In this second question, I realized the first sentence "On Monday.." can only mean that Monday is first day of events and this sentence refers to Tuesday. I would then look up how many hours per day he worked on Tuesday, which is 5.5 hours, and I can get rid of all the choices that do not equal this value. I would then look at the second sentence "He worked 8 hours each.." to see how many hours he worked on Wednesday. I then got one more time slot to work with and it's 45 minutes, which isn't that much. So I would use only 1 choice and see if I can apply the remaining hours. I can't on the first choice 8hrs and I used the other choices: 7.5hrs &7hrs. It worked so I got it right.<n><n>For the third question, first of all the choice C is wrong because a book sale means he sold a book. So I can eliminate it right away.<n><n>Fourth question:<n><n>```Python<n><n>class MyTestClass(unittest.TestCase):<n><n>def test_0(self):<n>  pass<n><n>def test_1(self):<n>  self.assertEqual( 'A', 'E')<n><n>if __name__ == '__main__':<n>  unittest.main()<n>```<n><n>Output: PASSED 1 test<n>

Calculate the sum of the numbers in the first 1000 digits of PI rounded to 2 digits.<n><n>Input: 25<n>Output: 26<n><n>##### Solution: There are two functions, one to print out the number, the other to calculate the sum. The first function will print the number out in a format that can be easily searched as a substring for the numbers. The second function creates an initial list of sum, which is the accumulation of sum to the previous number calculated. Then it goes through printing out the number as a string, converting the numbers from the string, finding the numbers, adding the numbers to sum, and returning sum. At the end, we also add to the previous sum to 49000000 (fourty nine million).<n><n><n><n><n>

The proverb is very appropriate, and I, myself, have experienced it when I injured my knees when playing rugby. For instance, two years ago, as a newbie in the team, I was very excited to use every opportunity I could to show my strength and capability as a winger in the team. The training was tough and I did not manage my energy correctly during that practice. So, about ten minutes into the practice session, I was tackled by one of my senior players. I was overpowered and slid across the field. We were very busy and it was during that session, as I was rushing to get my body back onto the rugby pitch, that I landed badly. My two knees made contact with the ground, but the main hit occurred on my left knee. It was a huge pain and I couldn't get up. After getting checked by the trainer and the coach, the doctor told me not to continue the training. I was disappointed with my knee injury and my first thought was about getting my revenge on the player who had tackled me. <n><n>### Instruction :Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>Fill in the blank:<n><n>There was an accident,________?

These basic tasks are used in programming, which enables the computer to understand the commands of program, which will be written on various scripting and computer language. The Data Structures are used to store the information that requires the computer to perform basic tasks of calculation, searching, sequencing, sorting, and updating.<n><n>Data Structure is a collection of data, which is organized in a particular way, so that retrieval can be implemented on the basis of certain aspects or operations, that are performed on the same type of data set. Most of the Data Structure are implemented in the form of the variable, which stores the data in the way memory of the computer, that allows efficient access to the data at a given time.<n><n><n><n><n>There are two types of data structures used in the program are as follows:<n><n><n>1. Stack<n>2. Queue<n><n><n><n><n>## 1. Stack<n><n>A stack is a special type of data structure in which the last member insert into the queue. It is considered as the dynamic data structure. Stack data structure provides some common operations like Insert, Deletions, Peek, and Pop. Stack is a finite-length container of generic data items that supports a FIFO(first in first out) or LIFO(last in first out) access paradigm which allow the deletion of elements from the top and push items onto the top of the stack.<n><n>```<n>struct node<n>{<n>    string item;<n>    node *next;<n>};<n>```<n><n>Stack is a dynamic data structure as the memory requirements increase based on the number of data items inserted into stack. Stack uses the pointer to link items together in stack to form a chain, also referred to as a singly-linked list. It allows to add and remove items at one end of the chain without disrupting all the other items in the set. The two main operations of a stack are push and pop which are used to add and remove items stored in the stack.<n><n>Add an item in Stack<n><n>    int stack[50], top=0;<n>    string item; <n>    cout << "Add an Item in Stack:" << endl;<n>    cout << "Enter an item: "; cin >> item;<n>    stack[top]

Choices:  A: city B: michigan C: three feet D: subdivision E: three arm span<n>Output:		C. C is correct. A yard is 3 feet x 3 feet<n><n>Input: I have a yard so long I have to mow it twice each week. If I mow it for each day and make that a week, that I will be through in about 5 days. So I should hire somebody to mow the yard while I'm working. However, the mowers are all booked up on that day, so I have to wait for a few days, and come back in the morning to find the rest of my garden so torn up and dug up that I can't even distinguish that I had a garden. After that, I try to grow some flowers to save some space so that I can fit my family in the garden. I try to sell them off too. But because my garden is so dug up after the guy who came to mow my garden did his work, the flowers wither off and die, so I didn't earn anything out of it. At the end of the month, I get my electricity bill because I'm not at home all the days that my family is at home, the electricity meters in my home start running all the way, because they think I'm in my house all the time. I get a $500 fine, so I get depressed and kill myself. So who's left? My dog! and he's really stupid. One day, he's trying to get out of his cage and he falls off from the second story of the house into a ditch full of water. It's raining heavily. I'm not at work because I get a month long suspension because I don't attend school for the whole month. So there's no one at home to save my dog.<n><n><n>## Output: Tapanga has<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>The solution is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWmz1Wl03_w

Output: 29<n>Because Tapanga has 28 candies than Corey, so we subtract Corey candies from Tapanga's candies, which is 28-22 = 6, and we have to subtract 2 of Corey's candies that he has already, 26 = 3 candies left.<n>### 2. Output: 10<n>Local calls have 5 cents a minutes cost, so Freddy spends 5*45 = 225cents, 25 cents for international calls times 31 minutes = 25 * 31 = 775 cents; total cost = 225+775 = $990<n>### 3.

Output: 300$<n>200*2=$400; 200*1=$200; 2*$200 = $400. total money $400+400= $800.<n>### 7. Output: 38<n>12/4 +15/3=12+5=17 books = 17/2 = 8.5 books<n>### 8.

Each line after contains the full name of an employee; each name is no longer than 20 characters. No 2 names in a file are the same.<n><n>My code, first of all, reads the 1st line of the file, which contains the number of employees in the file. Then, if the number of lines in the file are less than the number of employees: it means that I am already over the 3rd line, which is the loop I do, because the first line would be the line I read in order to find the 20. So it prints the word Employee, then prints 'Not Enough Data', and stops.<n><n>But if the number of lines are greater or equal the number of employees in a company, I use another loop I define in order to count each line that is greater than a maximum number I give in the second loop (the one defined in the if statement). The maximum number is the 20th. So I print each line, but I print 'No Name' when I reach the last line, even though there's another line that is also above the maximum line number and that contains a real name. So how do I print only 'No data' if there's no employee and otherwise print the name? And what if I want to count each real name? I know I have to use another loop. How do I count each real name? What should I use, if?<n><n>### Instructions:Read the following text, then answer the question below it.<n><n>"This is a sentence containing the word sentence.

You should select "image" as the category and then enter an image. If your image is correctly classified, you will be credited with one point. If your image cannot be classified, you will not be graded for this problem unless you indicate in your solution file that you did not classify your image correctly due to a bug in the code.<n><n>### Instruction:This is a regression challenge. You are given the two-dimensional data set and the target value. Your task is to fit a best-fit quadratic equation to the data set. That is, your objective is to solve for the two coefficients and the intercept in such a way that the sum of the squared residuals is minimized, where the residual is defined as |target(i) - prediction(i)| and "prediction" is the predicted value of the equation. If you need to optimize a non-linear function, you can use a non-linear minimization technique (i.e. Brent's method). You should use a numerical method to solve for the coefficients. Submit the coefficients, the intercept, and the residual sum of squares. If you were able to minimize the residual sum of squared error, you should get 0 for the residual sum of error. Note that the actual residual sum of error in this problem is 0.4233.<n><n>### Input:<n>### Data set (3x2 matrix):<n>#### [3 1]<n>#### [4 3]<n>#### [1 2]<n>#### The target value is 2.<n><n>#### Output:<n>#### The coefficients should be in order: a, b, c, d.<n>#### The residual sum of squares should be 0.<n><n><n><n>

Your answers should each be a few sentences in length, explaining each step.<n><n>1. What is the value of `1 + 3 +...+ 100`?<n>2. What is the longest word that can be made from the letters of the word'sporting'?<n>3. What is the largest number that can be made using the 8 digits `6-2-4-5-3-0-9`?<n><n>### Answer each of the prompts below in as few lines of Python code as possible. For each question, give the output of your program after you type it in into the Python interpreter.<n><n>1a. Prompt the user to enter a number. If the number is odd, display the number raised to the power -1, if the number is even display the number raised to an even power. The result should be output to the screen using print. Example: `x = int(input()) raise x**(-1) if x % 2!= 0 else x**2`<n>1b. In part a, don't display a number if its a power of 2. The result 2^2 = 4 should output 4. The result 8^2 = 64 should output 64. So it is ok to display a value of "1" for 2^1, but never 1^1<n>2a. Output "Yes" if the input word begins with "s" and ends with "y".<n>2b. In part 2a, return "No", just like a function, if the input word does not begin with's' and 'end' with a 'y'.

Of TV brands, I would like one that includes this feature: an LED. I would like for it to weigh no more than 75 pounds. However, I cannot tolerate it if a TV includes this feature: a projection. It should have the function to be used outdoors. I do not want any TV that includes these features: a refrigerator. It needs to be usable in a hotel room, and be able to be used for gaming. It needs to have the ability to be mounted on a wall, and be able to support a 3D TV. Furthermore, it needs to be portable, but not have a refrigerator unit. What TV should I buy?<n>Output: TV1 - <n>TV1 has the highest price, $2000, which is far more than I would like to spend. However, it meets many, but not all, of my requirements. It has an LED, weighs less than 75 pounds, can be used outdoors, can be set up in hotels, has a built-in gaming system, can be mounted on a wall with no problems, has 3D support, and cannot have a fridge unit. Unfortunately, it cannot be portable. Thus, TV1 is a no-go. <n><n><n>TV2 has a price of $500, which is a bit more than I wanted to spend. It is, however, portable, which makes it appealing. Also, it is usable in a hotel, so I can't argue with that. Plus, it is usable while gaming (who doesn't want to game while watching TV?) and has 3D support.<n>It also weighs less than a 75 pounds. It's downsides are that it does not have the feature of LEDs, and has a built in refrigerator. The lack of LEDs is okay since my next option has that feature! But refrigerators are not okay! So TV2 is not a good choice for me either.<n><n>TV3! TV3 looks appealing. It has an LED feature, and also fits in with the rest of my criteria, with the exception

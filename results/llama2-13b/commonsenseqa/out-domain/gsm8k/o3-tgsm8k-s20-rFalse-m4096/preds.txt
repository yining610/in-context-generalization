You can use the `csc` or `fsc` compiler in Visual<n>Studio to compile the code. Then, all you need to do is run the executable file that was created by the<n>comparison.<n>\item If you are getting an error message saying that the compiler cannot find the `stdlib.h` header file,<n>you need to include it in your code. This header file provides functions for dealing with standard<n>library features such as strings and file I/O.<n>\end{itemize}<n><n>Once you have compiled and run your code, you should see a success message indicating that the tests<n>were all passed. If not, then there may be other errors in your code that need to be fixed in order to solve this coding problem.

I am a beginner. I have my book in front of me to try solve it myself. But since this is an exam style problem I dont know how to proceed.<n><n>Comment: @MorganSearson, you need to provide a [mcve] of your own work as well as the problem text in the future to be able to get help on this site.<n><n>Comment: I've updated the question to add a brief explanation of how to get the problem text.<n><n>Comment: Why do you think "B" is the correct option when the question refers to `what`<n><n>Comment: Do you want to know the correct answer?<n><n>Comment: @AyushGupta: The solution to the problem is to examine, not commit suicide.<n><n>Comment: And the question text has no meaning as to what was examined?<n><n>Answer: Just a small guess, maybe there's something in the problem that should not be there, but it's better to know the correct answer and know whether you've found something like that or not. Here's my guess at the correct answer, from the way a question is phrased by your program:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>They decided to hash things<n>\end{code}.<n><n>It makes perfect sense, I guess - "hash things out" implies arguments that lead to a situation in which arguments are meaningless or are no more.<n><n>For your reference, Google provided me with only one option that is a valid answer and that is [examining thing](https://www.google.com/search?q=hash%20things%20out&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8).<n><n>Comment: I agree, and your solution is correct. It's not what I was taught in the class, but your answer makes sense. Thanks for your help!<n><n>Answer: First note as others have commented you should look in other places to see if you can get the correct answer. Also this looks like CAPTCHA to me.<n><n>From the question it looks like you just need to work through the choices. Each answer choice is followed by a sentence and a question after the sentence. I don't know if you are looking to

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 5<n><n>Input:They checked the weather one more time during the flight, they were on their way to paradise and wanted it to what? Choices:  A: look beautiful B: be happy C: change quickly D: occur here E: surprise us<n>Output:		D<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>For the first question, the answer is B.<n>The total number of candies that Tapanga and Core have both added up to 66. Therefore, Tapanga has less candies than Corey:<n><n>candies that Corey has = 66 - 8 = 58<n>The total number of Candies Tapangas: 66 - 58 = 8<n><n>For the second question, the answer is C. The correct approach can be broken down into three steps:<n><n>1) Calculate how many minutes local calls cost. Freddy’s dad and brother live in different cities. Since international calls cost \$ 25 / minute, the minutes they pay are double local calls.<n><n>\begin{aligned}<n>\text{total minutes paid} &= \text{total minutes the international call takes} - \text{total minutes of local call} \\<n>&= 55 + 31 - 45 \\<n>&= 21 \\<n>\end{aligned}<n><n>2) Calculate how many dollars local calls cost. To know the number of dollars paid for local calls, multiply the number of minutes by the amount per minute:<n><n>\begin{align}<n>\text{dollars paid} = \text{cost per minute} * \text{total minutes paid}\\<n>&5 * 21 = \$ 105<n>\end{align}<n><n>3) Determine how many dollars international calls cost. Multiply the number of minutes of the international call by the amount per minute. There is no need to deduct local minutes. However, this is not a complete solution because the correct answer is \$ 10 not $ \$ 105.<n>To solve this problem, we have to go back to the previous step and realize that we still have the total number of minutes the international calls are made. Therefore, we can deduct the local call minutes from total minutes we paid in step 3:<n><n>\begin {align}<n>\text { Total bill due } &= \text { cost per minute } * \text { total minutes paid } - \text { total minutes made? } \\<n>& \(5 * 21 - (55 + 30) = 15\)<n>\end {align}<n><n>For the third question, the answer is

Each cube has a single number printed on it, but the same numbers on different cubes are different. You must pick a random cube, and roll it 3 times. For each roll, you must record both the color of the cube that you rolled, and the number that you rolled, to the right of the color. After all 3 rolls, you must determine the minimum number of times that all 3 die could have the same face up. (Note: 13 is greater than 1097.) <n>For example:<n>If your 3 rolls were the following:<n><n>roll 1:<n>Red 2<n><n>roll 2:<n>White 4<n><n>roll 3:<n>Red 2,<n><n>the minimum number of times all 3 cube faces could have all been the same face up would be 13 (1097, which is the number of different ways the dice could be arranged, 5x5x5, minus 1).<n>Output: 13 (1)<n><n>(3) In a 12x12 grid, each tile is either green or blue.

Give the lowest index of the square that it must move to in order to be able to make 36 moves.<n>Output: 1 (1)<n><n>Input: Given 5 cards A, B, C, D, and E, each with a unique number from 1 to 5. Your task is to move A through E in sorted order, with each step taking three moves: move the card one space to the left; then one space down; then one space to the right. No move of a card involves picking up the card and then putting it down again. You may make any number of moves or no moves to accomplish the task.<n>Output: It is impossible<n><n>Input: Write a program that outputs the 25 unique integers 1 through 15 in alphabetical order.<n><n>Output: 14 15 3 5 6 8 9 11 12 1

It is the result of the execution of the program, including variables, constants, functions and classes. There are 4 types of outputs:<n>	<n>	1. Static Variable Output: This output remains the same even if the value of the variables inside the program is modified. For example, you have variable a and its value is 10 but still the value of a, remains 10 even if you change the value of a in the program.<n>	<n>	2. Dynamic variable Output: This type of output is changed with each modification in program variables. For example, let the variable a=10. Let the program contain a condition if:a=25 and b=35. Here you set a variable a=10 and then also you change the value of it in the program. So with the modification in initial values in the program, the output remains changing.<n>	<n>	3. Return Output: In Functions, return value is the output of the function. Its also a way by which the output of a function is defined.<n>	<n>	4.

Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n>Output:		F: Walk.<n><n><n>## Difficulty: Medium.<n><n>## Topics: Greedy Algorithm; DP.<n><n>## Discription:<n>If Tapanga and Coreys candies are given as a pair of integers. For example, they are [10, 12], then it is pretty easy to answer first two questions, since we have integers.<n><n>For the third question, we have fractions. However, I think the way to solve it is also pretty straightforward. We can convert it into an integer pair. How? The easiest way is to round (floor) the numbers off.<n>Rounding down:<n><n>```python<n>[10.5,12.34.0]=>[10,12]<n>[10.25,12.5373]=>[10.0,12.0]<n>[10.-1,12.321379]=>[10.-1 (0),12.32 ]=>[0,0.32 (32)]=>[0,4]<n>```<n>Rounding up:<n><n>```python <n>[10,-0.5]=>[10,.0]=>[11,0]<n>[-10,.45]=>[-10,.0) (no floating point)<n>[-10,.95]=>[-11,.0)<n>[-10,-1.10) ]=>[-10,-0.99)<n>[4.25, 4.401])=>[4.25]<n>```<n><n>Now, with integer pair, we can just follow the formula of greedy. However, the formula cannot work. I mean it would work but it would give the wrong results.<n>

How much was the total cost of that order?<n>Output: 8$.<n><n>-----------------------------<n><n>-----------------------------`Question2:<n><n>Write a program that asks a person about the number of days he/she has exercised during a week for five weeks. The main function should take an inout parameter called days, followed by n other inout parameters, each of which will be a string that holds the names of all the days of the week except Sunday, for example "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat". Write the code in the main function to print a message "How many days did you exercise during the week?" Once the user types a number, the code will then print the same message for all the other five weeks, using "last_Week" as a condition that allows for the message to change. The person should then answer the questions, but the code in main should not wait for the answers. Instead, the answers should be taken one at a time in each of the five "Week" functions. Within each of these functions, you should calculate the sum of the times during the week that the person exercised. When the user is finished typing answers, your program should then calculate the average of the number of times each day that the person exercised, rounding this figure to two decimal places and printing the answer using two formats:<n><n>First, print the answers one after the other, in a format, "Days during the week: Mon = x, Tue = x… Sun = x"; here, x is the average.<n><n>Then, just print the average number of times that the person exercised that week, like "Wed: Average – 3.2".

Then subtract the number of candies to get the number of candies that Corey has.<n><n>### How to run it: In the command prompt of your chosen IDE, navigate to any location of the files that you wish to submit to our professor. In there, type the number of run and the name of the file. Then it should start to run. After the command prompt turns blue, press CTRL+C to close it.<n><n>### Explanation to solution: For the question, 'How many candies are there between Corey and Tapanga?' I subtracted 6 from 72(the number of candies Corey has) and put the result(66) in an array.<n><n>In my second example, I created a sum and divided the total by 60. 60 is 1 hour long and is the number of minutes that each person talked. 5 X60 is the cost of a local call(5*60=300) and 25 X60 is 1500(25*60=1500) for a international call.<n><n>Then I calculated how many hours each person has.

Choices:  to increase the muscle strength to hold their head high because of the body's size to protect the spinal cord because it contains all the nerves that control the muscles for the head and neck not necessary to protect the spinal but to increase flexibility<n><n>Output: A<n>The spinal cord of vertebrae is protected only if the vertebrae are rigid enough to hold up the weight of the head. Humans, with their upright stance, need strong and firm vertebrae to bear the weight of the head constantly. A headache occurs when blood, carrying oxygen and nutrients to nerves and other cells, cannot reach the spine, which is blocked when the spine is compressed. A compressed spine causes a headache, and this pain can be experienced in any part of the body.<n><n>

When I first started to write this question, I came to a conclusion that the question seems to be related to **Array**, like the problem with arrays where you're given an array of numbers and you need to calculate how much each one pays. At first, I used a **for loop**. But after a few minutes of thinking, I realized that there was a number of elements that we need to compare. I tried to use **if, else** and **range()**, and it worked. But I was very inefficient because I didn't think about what **range()** do or what it was doing. So I looked up some solutions to how to use it and I found a more efficient way to use it. I realized that each item in the array would correspond to a number, like number  **0** to number **100**. So if we need to find 4th place I will call it **101**. But **if range()** returns me numbers only starting from 0, then it means that if I get 101, it still means that I got the 4th because the first number of range() will be 0, not 1. So for my new code, I wrote a **for loop** inside **range()**.<n><n>2. This time for this question I didn't needed to use any **if, else**, **for loops** or any advanced programming logic, because there wasn't any need for them.<n><n>3. I realized that I was right to think that if I used **range()** and **for loop**, I would be more faster and in more efficient than writing more loops.<n><n>### My Code and Solution for the Question (Solution is below)<n><n>```python<n># Question: What do you get when you multiply 7 by 5?<n><n># a. 14<n># b. 35<n>def answer (a, b):<n>    # Answer is 35<n>    answer =

The numbers d1,d2,...,dm are the distances from the first city to the cities labeled 2,3,...,m. The numbers d1 will not all be equal.<n><n>The second to the last line of the input file contains a non-negative integer n. The file concludes with a second to the last line containing a single integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, indicating a city number. The output file must start with the word "YES" and end with "NO". If all the distances specified above are less than the maximum possible distance of any of the other cities, then you should write the word "YES". Otherwise, you should write the word NO.<n>For example, let us start with a city labeled 1, and examine all the other cities. The other most distal city is the second. Now, we move to this city, and start examining all the other cities again. We have two other most distal cities: city 3, and city 4. Now we move to city 4. It is the more distal city from all the cities. So, the only city most distal from city 1 is city 4. We move to this city, now we again two most distal city from all rest of the cities: cities 5 and 6. Now we move to the more distal city that is city 6. The most distal city was city 6: So we are done, and the answer would be YES. Another example, take m = 4, distance between cites 1 and 2 is 26, between 1 and 3 is 15, between 1 and city 3 is 8 - the only city more distal from city 2 is city 3, so we are done. Now for m = 5, distance from 1 to 2 is 38, from 1 to 3 is 8, and distance from 1 to the remaining cities are 1. Cities 2 and 4 are most distal from the rest, but the distance from city 4 to city 2 is only 29, instead of 20

There are four "lines," not including the labels, in this puzzle. For instance, the first line ends with the word "see." The second line ends with the words "4 horses in a field."<n>The third line ends with the words, "How many more dog can."<n><n>The last, or final, line in the problem ends with the words, How many more dogs in a fence than 4 in a field?" **<n><n>In the first line, **SEE** is the subject, and "4 horses" is the object<n><n>In the second line, **SEE** and "4 horses" are objects as these are the

We will be writing a function that will return the sum of a set of values that range from a specific number up to a max. For example, if we are given the argument `nums = [1,3,8,2]` and `max = 12` the function should return the value 18. This is 1 + 3 + 8 + 2 and those are all up to 12. <n><n>## **Task**<n><n>Create two functions called ```sum``` and ```sum2```. The ```sum`` function will take in one argument that is the size of the range your function will work with. This is the max number your function will return the sum of for. So, if we give an argument of 10, we will be adding the values that are 0 - 9. That is 55. The number 10 isn't included in the range, so we subtract one

You can use a different approach (without considering any other data structure), and give the solution in a different way. <n>**Explanation:** <n><n>Input: L = abbbab<n>Output: acbab<n>**Question 2**<n>Given a sequence S of integers, calculate the largest sum of all possible pairs of consecutive integers in S.<n>### HINT:: You can brute force. That is to calculate the sums of all pairs, and keep the largest one. You also need to pay attention to time and space complexity. <n><n>**Example:** <n>Input: S = {13, 8, 20}<n>Sum of {13, 20} = 33<n><n>Output: 33<n><n>**Question 3**<n>For every possible value in the range [low, high], calculate the number of valid parentheses that can be constructed from the values in the range. For example, if low = 1 and high = 3, the valid parentheses are ((1)), (1), (12)). For a given value in the range, if the parentheses are constructed by concatenating this value with an adjacent element (either above or below it), the pair of parentheses is invalid. For example, ((34)) is invalid because 3 and 4 are adjacent to each other, but ((43)) is valid.<n>###HINT:: Think about DFS<n><n>**Example: 1**<n><n>Input: min = 0, max = 2<n>Output: 5 : (0), (1), (1), (2), (2)<n><n>**Example 2**<n><n>Input: low =  1, high = 3  <n>Output: 3<n>**Example 3**<n><n>Input:  min = 1

Numbers represent a certain kind of language, called [computational language](http://www.cs.nmt.edu/~cs421/sp15/ch4/node7.html). It follows a specific format: <n><n>- Numbers are followed by a letter indicating if they are variables. For instance, the output for question 4 is a "D" because D is a variable which needs to be changed for each person.<n>- The code is organized into functions. Each code section inside a function is followed by a function name (e.g. input(, output(...), etc)<n><n>- Each code section (including a function) must include four elements: <n>    - A name,<n>    - Any variables you will use,<n>    - The code itself,<n>    - In [ ] a description of how to change the variables to answer the question. <n><n>- Every section will be followed by an output statement (you can find the list of instructions here: [Instructions link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XEeDWUrUQhYQ6U3-d8K10JdvEI7Vqb9n/view?usp=sharing)).

It contains a lot of Java-syntax...?<n>Also, is your question asking how to write the code to solve these example questions?<n>If so, then I would advise you to learn a bit more about problem solving with programming languages. This can be done on the website codewars.com<n><n>Comment: Yes I'm learning python and java together. I think I know a lot about problem solving, I just don't know how to solve these problems on the website. I am a beginner so forgive me if I dont answer a lot of questions in detail.<n><n>Comment: Ah, okay. So I didn't understand that you had seen the code for this project, I don't want to seem rude. :) Could you please elaborate on what exactly is your problem with the code?<n><n>Comment: I dont know how to implement the code to solve these problem because I don't know if I'm thinking of the problem in the right way. I just don't have a whole lot of experience writing code.<n><n>Comment: Oh I see, I thought you had some code that would not run.<n>Well, I think the problem is that you're not really asking a question. But rather just showing your own code, which is already implemented.<n>The usual stack overflow questions are of the format: "I need to get from here to there. But I'm not sure how to get there, since I can't take the shortcut." So instead of showing us someone else's code, you should try to come up with some code that you would use to solve these problems. Then ask how to improve upon it.<n><n>Answer: The following pseudocode should be enough (i.e. doesn't account for all the special cases) to solve the problems presented in your example:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>def calculate_candies(num1, num2):<n>    return num1 - num2<n><n>def calculate_cost(total):<n>    return total / 5<n><n>def calculate_time(hours, minutes):<n>    return hours * 60 + minutes<n><n>def calculate_dog(answers):<n>    return answers.index('B')<n>\end{code}{}<n><n>Comment: This is some good pseudocode for the assignment but it doesn't

Do the same with input(). Once you figure out how this works, fill in 16 more cases.<n>### Example:<n>**input:** '1 1'<n>**output:** input() returns whatever is typed after the single quotes. input returns the value of whatever was typed. '1 1' means the code will read this as input and the next line as input. So input will read '1' and input will read 1.<n><n>### Input: Input the following information below. <n><n><n>###### ######################### ############################################# ###############################  #########################<n><n>Input: 1 1<n>Output: 1  1<n><n>**Input:** '2 1'<n>**Output:** input() returns the second line. '2 1' means we need to input 2, then 1. So when code executes '2 1' it will have executed this: input(),input() ---> 2 1 ---> 2     1. Since there are two numbers, in this case, we get the output: input() + input() ---> 3 1 ---> 3 9.<n><n>**Input: input() + input("145 157")**<n>**Output:** Because we have two inputs, we have to run input() twice. That puts a 145 in one input, and a 157 into the next. The order here is critical- input() + input(). When you input() the code first outputs (remember the 2 1) 145. Then it takes the new input, i.e. 157, from the second input and outputs 145 + 157 ---> 302<n><n>**Input: '3 2 input() input()'**<n>**Output: input() +'123 45' ---> 22345, then input() + '12345 input()' ---> 32550, then input() +'155 input()' ----> 54015**  <n><n>**Input: 2 13+input("16")**<n>

Therefore, the correct choices is A as the correct answer.<n><n>The number of minutes spent speaking to each parent is 45 + 31 = 76, for a total of 76 minutes spent speaking to both parents. Therefore, the total number of cents spent speaking to his family is 76 × (0.05 + 0.25) = 21. To determine total cost, we convert this to dollars by dividing by 100 as follows: 21 ÷ 100 = 0.21.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

He had a hangup.  He didn't like to be what? Choices:  A: orgasm B: cum C: naked D: in bed E: wearing his birthday suit<n>Output:		Option D:  in bed<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>The word 'enjoy' means that you like doing something. That means that you get pleasure from doing something. The word 'enjoyable' means that something is enjoyable. That means that something you do, you like doing it, and it brings you pleasure.<n><n>John didn't enjoy sex in his marriage because he wasn't happy in his marriage. He was actually in a loveless marriage with his wife. That means that his wife didn't love him, and he didn't love her. The word'marry' is the present tense of the verb'marry.'<n><n>A 'hangup' is an informal version of the word 'hangover.' That means that your hangup is like a hangover. If you have a hangover, then you drink too much, and you pay for it the next day.<n><n>A hangover is something that happens to you. A hangup is something that we do. When we hang up the phone, then we hang up the phone. And that means that we put it down. When we hang up on someone, then that means that we end a conversation by hanging up the phone while they're still talking.<n><n>We hang up on the phones because our phone bills are too expensive. The phone company charges us for every minute that we use the phone. We hang up because it costs too much to talk on the phone.<n><n>E: wearing  his birthday suit<n><n>Option D is correct choice.<n><n>We call it the birthday-suit because when people are born, they are naked. When people are born, they have their birthday suits on. And when people have their birthday suites on, that means that they aren't wearing any clothes.<n><n>If someone is naked, that means that they're not wearing clothes. We call it the 'naked' because, like we said before, when people are born, that means that they are naked.<n><n>Option A: The phrase 'orgasm' comes from 'orgy,' the word for a party where people have sex with each other. People use the word 'orgasm' when they describe the feeling of having sex.<n><n>Option B: When someone masturbates, that means that they have sex with themselves. In other words, a man mast

He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 5<n><n>Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by many people recently? Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n>Output:		E<n>Earth's atmosphere contains gaseous pollutants such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are emitted by vehicles, the manufacture of steel and other industries. These substances are respired by all living things. For example, human beings have been brewing our atmosphere with carbon dioxide since the beginning of our existence as they expel into the atmosphere. The human respiratory system is approximately 18.5% CO2 and a human exhales a liter of CO2 everyday. (12.1 L x 0.1932 = 2.38 L / day). When we add up all living organisms (plants and animals), human beings alone create about a billion liters of extra CO2 every day. In the past 100 years, humans have contributed 225 billion tons of CO2! In total, the total amount of CO2 is close to 12.28 × 10^11 tons annually. This means that the earth's atmosphere holds about 338000000 2.38 l of CO2 on average each day and therefore it would require about 1062 times an individual exhale. According to the "law of exponential growth," every additional increase in the number of members of a population will cause an order of magnitude increase in population size after a fixed amount of time. This growth is also known as "the Rule of 70." Since the global population grows with an annual rate of about 1.2%, the population will double in 60 years. The exponential growth of CO2 will mean that in a few tens of years, there will be a thousand times more of CO2 than in the previous few tens of years than in the average air that humans have exhaled on Earth.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n><a href="https://imgshare.io/image/64644700bd9a0b0cd38964c160f0949b"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jJr2qZ5.png"></a><n></br><n>*I have made several test cases which can be found in this </br><n> [test file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13

It seems likely that each line is being repeated three times - but there is also a fourth iteration where things seem slightly different (lines seem to have been re-numbered).

I suspect it's in one of the other.sty files in the eulervm.zip package.<n><n>Comment: It looks like eulervm actually has some code for re-numbering lines. I haven't a clue what it does, I did only look at the first part of it. It should be possible to fix, but I suspect it will be someone with experience of the package.

You can use the `csc` or `fsc` compiler in Visual\nStudio to compile the code. Then, all you need to do is run the executable file that was created by the\ncomparison.\n\\item If you are getting an error message saying that the compiler cannot find the `stdlib.h` header file,\nyou need to include it in your code. This header file provides functions for dealing with standard\nlibrary features such as strings and file I/O.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nOnce you have compiled and run your code, you should see a success message indicating that the tests\nwere all passed. If not, then there may be other errors in your code that need to be fixed in order to solve this coding problem.", "answer": "E: airplane"}

{"idx": 200, "text": "D\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor the first question, the answer is B.\nThe total number of candies that Tapanga and Core have both added up to 66. Therefore, Tapanga has less candies than Corey:\n\ncandies that Corey has = 66 - 8 = 58\nThe total number of Candies Tapangas: 66 - 58 = 8\n\nFor the second question, the answer is C. The correct approach can be broken down into three steps:\n\n1) Calculate how many minutes local calls cost. Freddy\u2019s dad and brother live in different cities. Since international calls cost \\$ 25 / minute, the minutes they pay are double local calls.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{total minutes paid} &= \\text{total minutes the international call takes} - \\text{total minutes of local call} \\\\\n&= 55 + 31 - 45 \\\\\n&= 21 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\n2) Calculate how many dollars local calls cost. To know the number of dollars paid for local calls, multiply the number of minutes by the amount per minute:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{dollars paid} = \\text{cost per minute} * \\text{total minutes paid}\\\\\n&5 * 21 = \\$ 105\n\\end{align}\n\n3) Determine how many dollars international calls cost. Multiply the number of minutes of the international call by the amount per minute. There is no need to deduct local minutes. However, this is not a complete solution because the correct answer is \\$ 10 not $ \\$ 105.\nTo solve this problem, we have to go back to the previous step and realize that we still have the total number of minutes the international calls are made. Therefore, we can deduct the local call minutes from total minutes we paid in step 3:\n\n\\begin {align}\n\\text { Total bill due } &= \\text { cost per minute } * \\text { total minutes paid } - \\text { total minutes made? } \\\\\n& \\(5 * 21 - (55 + 30) = 15\\)\n\\end {align}\n\nFor the third question, the answer is", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}

It is the result of the execution of the program, including variables, constants, functions and classes. There are 4 types of outputs:\n\t\n\t1. Static Variable Output: This output remains the same even if the value of the variables inside the program is modified. For example, you have variable a and its value is 10 but still the value of a, remains 10 even if you change the value of a in the program.\n\t\n\t2. Dynamic variable Output: This type of output is changed with each modification in program variables. For example, let the variable a=10. Let the program contain a condition if:a=25 and b=35. Here you set a variable a=10 and then also you change the value of it in the program. So with the modification in initial values in the program, the output remains changing.\n\t\n\t3. Return Output: In Functions, return value is the output of the function. Its also a way by which the output of a function is defined.\n\t\n\t4. Print and OutPut: In programs where you don\u2019t need any output to be kept or saved, you use output or print.\n\t\nExamples of Outputs:\n\t\n\ta=10\n\tOutput: [type 'int']\n\t\nb=30.\n\tOutput: [10]\n\t#Output of variable a\n\t\n## In Python:\n\tVariable b=30.  #Output of variable b", "answer": "A: mail orders"}

These two integers should appear in two spaces after the '=' sign.

The main function should take an inout parameter called days, followed by n other inout parameters, each of which will be a string that holds the names of all the days of the week except Sunday, for example \"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\". Write the code in the main function to print a message \"How many days did you exercise during the week?\" Once the user types a number, the code will then print the same message for all the other five weeks, using \"last_Week\" as a condition that allows for the message to change. The person should then answer the questions, but the code in main should not wait for the answers. Instead, the answers should be taken one at a time in each of the five \"Week\" functions. Within each of these functions, you should calculate the sum of the times during the week that the person exercised. When the user is finished typing answers, your program should then calculate the average of the number of times each day that the person exercised, rounding this figure to two decimal places and printing the answer using two formats:\n\nFirst, print the answers one after the other, in a format, \"Days during the week: Mon = x, Tue = x\u2026 Sun = x\"; here, x is the average.\n\nThen, just print the average number of times that the person exercised that week, like \"Wed: Average \u2013 3.2\".", "answer": "E: produce"}

Then subtract the number of candies to get the number of candies that Corey has.\n\n### How to run it: In the command prompt of your chosen IDE, navigate to any location of the files that you wish to submit to our professor. In there, type the number of run and the name of the file. Then it should start to run. After the command prompt turns blue, press CTRL+C to close it.\n\n### Explanation to solution: For the question, 'How many candies are there between Corey and Tapanga?' I subtracted 6 from 72(the number of candies Corey has) and put the result(66) in an array.\n\nIn my second example, I created a sum and divided the total by 60. 60 is 1 hour long and is the number of minutes that each person talked. 5 X60 is the cost of a local call(5*60=300) and 25 X60 is 1500(25*60=1500) for a international call.\n\nThen I calculated how many hours each person has.", "answer": "D: hat rack"}

When I first started to write this question, I came to a conclusion that the question seems to be related to **Array**, like the problem with arrays where you're given an array of numbers and you need to calculate how much each one pays. At first, I used a **for loop**. But after a few minutes of thinking, I realized that there was a number of elements that we need to compare. I tried to use **if, else** and **range()**, and it worked. But I was very inefficient because I didn't think about what **range()** do or what it was doing. So I looked up some solutions to how to use it and I found a more efficient way to use it. I realized that each item in the array would correspond to a number, like number  **0** to number **100**. So if we need to find 4th place I will call it **101**. But **if range()** returns me numbers only starting from 0, then it means that if I get 101, it still means that I got the 4th because the first number of range() will be 0, not 1. So for my new code, I wrote a **for loop** inside **range()**.\n\n2. This time for this question I didn't needed to use any **if, else**, **for loops** or any advanced programming logic, because there wasn't any need for them.\n\n3. I realized that I was right to think that if I used **range()** and **for loop**, I would be more faster and in more efficient than writing more loops.\n\n### My Code and Solution for the Question (Solution is below)\n\n```python\n# Question: What do you get when you multiply 7 by 5?\n\n# a. 14\n# b. 35\ndef answer (a, b):\n    # Answer is 35\n    answer =", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

The function that is going to be used in a recursive format must be passed in a common variable.\n\n\t3. Both the recursive case and the mutual recursive function can only call each other.\n\n### How do we handle infinite recursive calls?\n\n\tFirst stop writing recursive functions.\n\n### Describe Turing completeness.\n\n### Explain stack overflow and how to handle it in a mutual recursive function\n\n### What languages in the language lab are imperative languages?\n\n\tAll\n\n### What kind of languages are Prolog, Erlang, R, and C? \n\n\tFunctional languages\n\n### What language is Lisp?\n\n\tLisp is based on functional programming. Hence, it is a functional language as well.\n\n### Why are Python and Ruby based on functional programming when they are not functional languages?\n\n\tTheir programming model resembles functional programming. For example, they both tend to have a single method with a return value and no side effects.", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}

Now, we move to this city, and start examining all the other cities again. We have two other most distal cities: city 3, and city 4. Now we move to city 4. It is the more distal city from all the cities. So, the only city most distal from city 1 is city 4.

How to read a puzzle**\n\nThe puzzles above are written in a standard format that looks a little different from a run-of-the-mill English sentence.\n\nLet's start with the following sample prompt:\n\n**Question: The man can see four horses in a field. How many more dogs can he see in the fence?**\n\nThe \"Question:\" is the first line of text, or label, that tells you what follows is a multiple choice question.\nThe first two lines in the example are the most important: the description.\n\nIt tells you that our \"man\" can \"see\" four \"horses\" in \"a\" field. If you're already doing mental gymnastics at this stage, then congrats! You're already thinking like a coding boot camp student.\n\n**\n\nThe man's ability to see something (or see something in a certain way) is the subject of the sentence. The object of the sentence is \"four horses,\" the number of horses he sees in a field.\n\n**\nIf we replace the horses with dogs, we've created the next line: How many more dogs can our man see in the fence than four in the field?\n\nOr, we could ask, How many more dogs can the man see in a fence than in the field?\nYou can see the difference here and how much it changes the puzzle. The most important takeaway here is that it's important to read the problem carefully.\n\n**\nNow let's continue with our original prompt: The man can see 4 horses in a field.\nHow many more dog can he see in a fence? There are four \"lines,\" not including the labels, in this puzzle. For instance, the first line ends with the word \"see.\" The second line ends with the words \"4 horses in a field.\"\nThe third line ends with the words, \"How many more dog can.\"\n\nThe last, or final, line in the problem ends with the words, How many more dogs in a fence than 4 in a field?\" **\n\nIn the first line, **SEE** is the subject, and \"4 horses\" is the object\n\nIn the second line, **SEE** and \"4 horses\" are objects as these are the", "answer": "A: read"}

It should produce a list of strings that is generated by converting numbers from the list into words, separated by commas. Example\n\n- Input: `golf([2, 12, 33], \u2018first\u2019)`\n\n- Output: `[12, first, second, third, for, the]\n\n\n\n## #1980 #1980\n\n## **Note to Student**\n\nIn this exercise we will be working with the numbers in a range of values. We will be writing a function that will return the sum of a set of values that range from a specific number up to a max. For example, if we are given the argument `nums = [1,3,8,2]` and `max = 12` the function should return the value 18. This is 1 + 3 + 8 + 2 and those are all up to 12. \n\n## **Task**\n\nCreate two functions called ```sum``` and ```sum2```. The ```sum`` function will take in one argument that is the size of the range your function will work with. This is the max number your function will return the sum of for. So, if we give an argument of 10, we will be adding the values that are 0 - 9. That is 55. The number 10 isn't included in the range, so we subtract one", "answer": "E: newspaper"}

It contains only one integer, which stores the number of points the current exam has.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n### Here are a few test questions you can try. \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Question 1**\nGiven the  strings in the list L, calculate the string X (with the same length as every string in L) that has the largest number of unique characters.\n### Hint:: This is a brute force, so it will run very time. You can use a different approach (without considering any other data structure), and give the solution in a different way. \n**Explanation:** \n\nInput: L = abbbab\nOutput: acbab\n**Question 2**\nGiven a sequence S of integers, calculate the largest sum of all possible pairs of consecutive integers in S.\n### HINT:: You can brute force. That is to calculate the sums of all pairs, and keep the largest one. You also need to pay attention to time and space complexity. \n\n**Example:** \nInput: S = {13, 8, 20}\nSum of {13, 20} = 33\n\nOutput: 33\n\n**Question 3**\nFor every possible value in the range [low, high], calculate the number of valid parentheses that can be constructed from the values in the range. For example, if low = 1 and high = 3, the valid parentheses are ((1)), (1), (12)). For a given value in the range, if the parentheses are constructed by concatenating this value with an adjacent element (either above or below it), the pair of parentheses is invalid. For example, ((34)) is invalid because 3 and 4 are adjacent to each other, but ((43)) is valid.\n###HINT:: Think about DFS\n\n**Example: 1**\n\nInput: min = 0, max = 2\nOutput: 5 : (0), (1), (1), (2), (2)\n\n**Example 2**\n\nInput: low =  1, high = 3  \nOutput: 3\n**Example 3**\n\nInput:  min = 1", "answer": "D: zoological gardens"}

Numbers represent a certain kind of language, called [computational language](http://www.cs.nmt.edu/~cs421/sp15/ch4/node7.html). It follows a specific format: \n\n- Numbers are followed by a letter indicating if they are variables. For instance, the output for question 4 is a \"D\" because D is a variable which needs to be changed for each person.\n- The code is organized into functions. Each code section inside a function is followed by a function name (e.g. input(, output(...), etc)\n\n- Each code section (including a function) must include four elements: \n    - A name,\n    - Any variables you will use,\n    - The code itself,\n    - In [ ] a description of how to change the variables to answer the question. \n\n- Every section will be followed by an output statement (you can find the list of instructions here: [Instructions link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XEeDWUrUQhYQ6U3-d8K10JdvEI7Vqb9n/view?usp=sharing)).

I am a beginner so forgive me if I dont answer a lot of questions in detail.\n\nComment: Ah, okay. So I didn't understand that you had seen the code for this project, I don't want to seem rude. :) Could you please elaborate on what exactly is your problem with the code?\n\nComment: I dont know how to implement the code to solve these problem because I don't know if I'm thinking of the problem in the right way. I just don't have a whole lot of experience writing code.\n\nComment: Oh I see, I thought you had some code that would not run.\nWell, I think the problem is that you're not really asking a question. But rather just showing your own code, which is already implemented.\nThe usual stack overflow questions are of the format: \"I need to get from here to there. But I'm not sure how to get there, since I can't take the shortcut.\" So instead of showing us someone else's code, you should try to come up with some code that you would use to solve these problems. Then ask how to improve upon it.\n\nAnswer: The following pseudocode should be enough (i.e. doesn't account for all the special cases) to solve the problems presented in your example:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef calculate_candies(num1, num2):\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef calculate_cost(total):\n    return total / 5\n\ndef calculate_time(hours, minutes):\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\ndef calculate_dog(answers):\n    return answers.index('B')\n\\end{code}{}\n\nComment: This is some good pseudocode for the assignment but it doesn't", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

{"idx": 695, "text": "D\n\n### Hint:Use the input() function and see how many numbers are put into the box when only one number is put in. Do the same with input(). Once you figure out how this works, fill in 16 more cases.\n### Example:\n**input:** '1 1'\n**output:** input() returns whatever is typed after the single quotes. input returns the value of whatever was typed. '1 1' means the code will read this as input and the next line as input. So input will read '1' and input will read 1.\n\n### Input: Input the following information below. \n\n\n###### ######################### ############################################# ###############################  #########################\n\nInput: 1 1\nOutput: 1  1\n\n**Input:** '2 1'\n**Output:** input() returns the second line. '2 1' means we need to input 2, then 1. So when code executes '2 1' it will have executed this: input(),input() ---> 2 1 ---> 2     1. Since there are two numbers, in this case, we get the output: input() + input() ---> 3 1 ---> 3 9.\n\n**Input: input() + input(\"145 157\")**\n**Output:** Because we have two inputs, we have to run input() twice. That puts a 145 in one input, and a 157 into the next. The order here is critical- input() + input(). When you input() the code first outputs (remember the 2 1) 145. Then it takes the new input, i.e. 157, from the second input and outputs 145 + 157 ---> 302\n\n**Input: '3 2 input() input()'**\n**Output: input() +'123 45' ---> 22345, then input() + '12345 input()' ---> 32550, then input() +'155 input()' ----> 54015**  \n\n**Input: 2 13+input(\"16\")**", "answer": "D: staying there"}

{"idx": 776, "text": "Option D:  in bed\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe word 'enjoy' means that you like doing something. That means that you get pleasure from doing something. The word 'enjoyable' means that something is enjoyable. That means that something you do, you like doing it, and it brings you pleasure.\n\nJohn didn't enjoy sex in his marriage because he wasn't happy in his marriage. He was actually in a loveless marriage with his wife. That means that his wife didn't love him, and he didn't love her. The word'marry' is the present tense of the verb'marry.'\n\nA 'hangup' is an informal version of the word 'hangover.' That means that your hangup is like a hangover. If you have a hangover, then you drink too much, and you pay for it the next day.\n\nA hangover is something that happens to you. A hangup is something that we do. When we hang up the phone, then we hang up the phone. And that means that we put it down. When we hang up on someone, then that means that we end a conversation by hanging up the phone while they're still talking.\n\nWe hang up on the phones because our phone bills are too expensive. The phone company charges us for every minute that we use the phone. We hang up because it costs too much to talk on the phone.\n\nE: wearing  his birthday suit\n\nOption D is correct choice.\n\nWe call it the birthday-suit because when people are born, they are naked. When people are born, they have their birthday suits on. And when people have their birthday suites on, that means that they aren't wearing any clothes.\n\nIf someone is naked, that means that they're not wearing clothes. We call it the 'naked' because, like we said before, when people are born, that means that they are naked.\n\nOption A: The phrase 'orgasm' comes from 'orgy,' the word for a party where people have sex with each other. People use the word 'orgasm' when they describe the feeling of having sex.\n\nOption B: When someone masturbates, that means that they have sex with themselves. In other words, a man mast", "answer": "C: naked"}

{"idx": 833, "text": "E\nEarth's atmosphere contains gaseous pollutants such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are emitted by vehicles, the manufacture of steel and other industries. These substances are respired by all living things. For example, human beings have been brewing our atmosphere with carbon dioxide since the beginning of our existence as they expel into the atmosphere. The human respiratory system is approximately 18.5% CO2 and a human exhales a liter of CO2 everyday. (12.1 L x 0.1932 = 2.38 L / day). When we add up all living organisms (plants and animals), human beings alone create about a billion liters of extra CO2 every day. In the past 100 years, humans have contributed 225 billion tons of CO2! In total, the total amount of CO2 is close to 12.28 \u00d7 10^11 tons annually. This means that the earth's atmosphere holds about 338000000 2.38 l of CO2 on average each day and therefore it would require about 1062 times an individual exhale. According to the \"law of exponential growth,\" every additional increase in the number of members of a population will cause an order of magnitude increase in population size after a fixed amount of time. This growth is also known as \"the Rule of 70.\" Since the global population grows with an annual rate of about 1.2%, the population will double in 60 years. The exponential growth of CO2 will mean that in a few tens of years, there will be a thousand times more of CO2 than in the previous few tens of years than in the average air that humans have exhaled on Earth.\n\n### Answer:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgshare.io/image/64644700bd9a0b0cd38964c160f0949b\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jJr2qZ5.png\"></a>\n</br>\n*I have made several test cases which can be found in this </br>\n [test file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13", "answer": "D: train station"}

It seems likely that each line is being repeated three times - but there is also a fourth iteration where things seem slightly different (lines seem to have been re-numbered). This must be down to some \\print{number} code somewhere. I suspect it's in one of the other.sty files in the eulervm.zip package.\n\nComment: It looks like eulervm actually has some code for re-numbering lines. I haven't a clue what it does, I did only look at the first part of it. It should be possible to fix, but I suspect it will be someone with experience of the package.", "answer": "A: linen closet"}

However, two days later, Yvette got the same speed limit information on a different road and went for a ride. She found out that the road she had driven on had two lane and a shoulder but the second road had only one lane. Also, there were more drivers and cyclists on the second road.

The fact that Yvette was driving at the correct speed given her choice and that the second road had a higher speed limit shows that since she did not pass anyone, she must be going at the speed limit. The correct answer is B.\n\n---\n\n### Instruction:Answer the next set of multiple choice questions:\n\n1. You have a stock of 150 pencils in your room. Out of these, you need to give a few as gifts.

The rent for one bedroom is $\\$2000$ and for the other bedroom is $\\$1800$. How much does it cost for the two of them to rent the apartment for a year?\n\n**Solution**:\nTwo women are sharing an apartment that has two bedrooms.\n\nLet us assume the total rent as $x$.\n\n$1800 = x - 2000$;\n\n$200 \\leq x \\leq 3800$;\n\nIf rent is 3800, then they need to rent an apartment that has three bedrooms\n\nIf it is 2000, there are no such apartments as both the women would not be able to find the third roommate who is agreeable to share the third bedroom.\n\nThis is just one scenario, so the answer is as follows\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n  x &= 2800  \\\\ \\\\\n  2(2000 + 2800) &= x + x \\\\ \\\\\n 4200    &= 2x \\\\ \\\\\n  x       &= 2100\n \\end{align}$$\n\nThe solution is $x = 2100$ which is $200$ less than the cost of renting the second bedroom of the apartment.\n\n### 4 Writing Code in Python\n\n#### Lists\n\nA list is a datatype in Python that can hold many different kinds of data, including numbers, strings, and objects.

NLP gives computers the most basic capabilities to interpret the data, while enabling the user to use language as naturally as possible. This field is associated with many different disciplines like Artificial intelligence (AI), Computational Linguistics, Psychology, Mathematics, Statistics, Cognitive Science, Philosophy, and Cognitive Psychology.\n\nComputers can not just interact like humans but also can understand what is being said. For a machine to understand language, it must be able to analyze, interpret, manipulate, and generate it. In recent years. NLP programs have come a long ways in analyzing and understanding texts but it still has a very long way to go in the field of natural language processing. With the help of NLTK library and some python libraries, which will have a great impact on solving text related problems, we can analyze and understand the texts and also the world at large. We can find hidden knowledge within massive unstructured text datasets, extract insights, and summarize large amounts of textual information. NLTK allows you to do this with a few lines of Python code!\n\nNLP library in Python\n\nThe NLP has a wide range of applications, such as machine translation, information retrieval, automated summarization, sentiment analysis, natural language generation and relationship extraction.\n\nThis part is for the beginner in NLP. They can learn what is NLP, what are the applications of NLP and NLTK Python language.\n\nWe will continue for more challenges in NLP.\n\nIn our first lesson (Part 1), we will get started with NLTK. From here, we'll create word lists, learn how analyze and understand our text, summarize documents, and create models that generate text.\n\n### 49.1 Part1:Introduction to NLP :\n\nNever miss a new course!\n\n\n\nNow you can master data science even if you don\u2019t know how to code.

Thanks!\n\nComment: Welcome to Code Review! Can you also add the code to your question as well just in case the link ever goes dead or gets moved which is more than likely? When adding the code make sure and remove all comments for better context. Also can you try not to make it all one line? It makes it a little easier to read since the way Stackoverflow displays your code is not like your IDE. Again welcome and happy reviewing!\n\nComment: What are we supposed to be reviewing here?

I'm just interested in seeing if this code is good enough for a career change. So looking for comments\n\nAnswer: \\section{Naming}\n\nYour variables all start with capital letters. In Python, variable naming conventions dictate that you should use lower case, even for classes and functions. So, you should call your function `answers` and make all of your variables `answer`.\n\n\\section{Function Logic}\n\nIf you are only ever going to return a single variable, there is no point in making this so complicated. Your existing logic is overkill.\n\nYou have a `while` loop that can iterate forever, checking for specific conditions. In this case, it is not a good idea.\n\nWhat you are probably looking for is `index < len(questions)`. As your list has a fixed size, you can just keep checking to see if you are at the end of the list and return an answer. If you don't return an answer, you will keep asking the user until they answer one that is correctly.\n\n\\section{Returning Nothing}\n\nYou can return nothing using `return None` or just `return`.\n\n\\section", "answer": "B: city"}

The next day they must find another mathematician, but only earn this.\nOutput:15393\n\n### Question 1 answer\n\n$27000$ is our final answer  \n\nWe can simplify this by breaking down the total by the number of days of the year. $27000\\cdot250=6750$ we know that the final number of days is 365.  \nSo we use the formula to multiply everyday by the number of days that day takes up to 365.\n\nThen we take the amount of days that the mathematician works each year and times it by the answer we just did. \n$300160$ is the new answer  \n\nFinally we take each day and times it by $8.88$  which gives the total:  \n`8.88*30016=263400.24`\n\n### Question Answer 3 \n\nI first started this problem by simplifying.\n\n$66$ candies together and $74$ total candies\n\nThen i took the new equation and used the formula.  \nSo I divided the total candies $74$ by the candies that were $66$\n\n$74:66=1.12$\n\nI then multipled my answer by the original $66$ candies to get the new answer\n\n$66x1.12=74$  \n\nIf I do this same", "answer": "E: copulate"}

Please describe what you are trying to accomplish.\n\nComment: I am trying to solve Hackerrank problems. This page specifically is to make the solution easier to share.\n\nAnswer: Ok, so, you are writing a function that performs the desired operations.\n\nStart by defining a single function that runs over an entire test case and passes in an object (`this.input`) that has the necessary pieces.\n\nThen break the parts down into different steps.\n\nFirst step, read the whole input into a single variable.  You'll use `String.split` to do this.\n\nSecond step, iterate over the individual elements of the input.  For each one, extract the corresponding value and store it as a property of the testing object.\n\nYour actual `solve` function will need to know what to do with the different kinds of input.  So this might be a good time to break the whole problem down into small steps.\n\nIe, find out what you need to do with one kind of input.  Then create a function that takes that type of input and returns the corresponding result.  Repeat for as many types of input a problem can have.\n\nComment: This helped very much, but I am still stuck. The problem I am still having is that the code does not read the input. For example, it looks to a problem like this:\n\n`Input: 1 + 2 = 3\nOutput: 3`\n\nThe code would read 1 and 2 and divide them, but then it would need to multiply the resulting answer, but I am getting stuck for that. Any ideas would be extremely appreciated!\n\nAnswer: Here is the solution to the first problem:\n\n\\begin{code}\nlet solve = function(input) {\n\n    // Split input from new line characters\n    let splitInput = input.split(\"\\", "answer": "A: countryside"}

{"idx": 683, "text": "A\n\n\n#### How would you approach the problem and what data structure and what sort of programing language you would employ?\nThe problem requires you to take different inputs and return a value depending on the input. For example, you will take an integer which is the question of the day and another integer which is the answer to solve this integer equation and return the value which represents one of five choices.\n\nThe first step will be to write a function to read an integer and convert this integer into a string representation of this integer.  The next step will be to ask all your input questions in a loop and keep reading an integer, converting this integer into a string and getting one line of input. After obtaining a complete set of inputs, your program will be able to start working on solving the questions in the following loop which will run until all questions are done.  The loop will solve each question by getting its entire text representation to a string variable, and then parsing the text representation of the question to find all the answers.  Finally, our program will loop over the answers and see which one of the choices has a corresponding int returned as its value so this value is printed on the standard out.\n\nThere is one more issue with your code which is that you have only written the function in C++ which converts a string to an integer and not in python.   There are two ways in which we could fix this by either implementing the same function again in python or by changing our algorithm so that the entire code can be written in python.\nFor both the algorithms we are going to keep adding each question to a variable which will keep growing as we read a new input line. However, we will only have to process one line of input at any moment. This is done because each question has its own line and thus we will always have to keep track of only the questions which are currently being solved.\n\nAs an example let us assume that your code looks like the following before the first line is read:\n\n    q0 = \"\";\n    ans = \"\";\n    str = \"\";\n\n    q0 will keep growing as you read in a single line, when the next line is input it will be assigned to q1, and so on. When this code runs as expected, q1 will contain all the text from the second question, so q1 will look like this:\n\n    q1 = \"\\n Input: How much does David weigh?

However, you shouldn't combine loops to tackle multiple questions on a single line. Additionally, you cannot hardcode any solution as part of your program.\n\n### Hints:\n1. Start off with the simplest case: question #1.\n2. You do not need to prompt users to enter anything using the `input` statement. In other words: do not use `input('Enter the time in seconds:')`\n3. The solution to one or more of the problems might be too small to output as a float or an integer. Instead, output the solution as a string. So if the solution is 116, output the string `\"116\"`\n4. Make sure you read the `print` and `print()\\n` statements carefully\n5. The first time you run your program to check how the problems will be ordered, you should use `input('Enter any number (1-5) to get a different problem:  ')` to prompt the users to enter a value. This will ensure that the program executes one question at a time.\n6. Feel free to use the print method `print(variable1, variable2)` for outputting two variables.\n7.

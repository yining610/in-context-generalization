{"idx": 114, "text": "E\n\n#### Answering the Instructions:\n\nTo answer these questions, we must first have a set of helper functions in order to solve these questions. In this case, we need a function to format the questions and to get the answers as numbers (as some questions need you to get an answer between 2 numbers, i.e. \u201cThere are 4 cookies in the cookie jar. His mom eats 2 of them and then gives 3 to his dad. How many cookies are there now?\u201d). The helper function has 2 functions: `format_question` and `convert_to_number`.\n\nTo format the question, we take each number and then print it with a space (ex. `\\n12 12`). Then, we take each choice and each correct answer and then print them with numbers (ex. `1|62|6`). Before we use this function, we have to make sure that `question` and `choices` are both strings, otherwise our code may fail. So we have to split each of them by \" \", then make them into lists and then use this function.", "answer": "D: missing out"}

For instance, one can start a sentence with \"I\" if it's short and the topic is not what is going on in another person's mind. And one can still state that other person's point of view, by writing, for example, \"So-and-so thinks...\" or \"So-and- so said to me that...\". \"I\" (the first person pronoun) is useful when there are going to be several people's ideas involved in a single sentence. (Note that you can see some of these choices demonstrated in my sentences here.) One could write, \"Alice, Bob, and Charlie all thought that...\" but the reader has to stop and remember which name belonged to which idea. One can improve the sentence if instead of giving individual names one begins with \"We (the group of three people) thought that...\" or \"We all agreed that...\" The sentence is much cleaner, and there is no \"trip up\" when one gets to the very last person's opinion, which might come as a surprise. Sometimes the reader (you) and I (or the writer) may be able to infer by context who some of the people", "answer": "B: fragile"}

Some of the tallest of these trees can even grow to be a total height of 100-150 feet! For the most part, these trees are easy to spot on a tree-line landscape; however, at first glance, they can be easily confused with a different type of tree that is known as a \"Juglandaceae\". This other species of tree can be distinguished from the \"Rosaceae\" trees in that the shape of the leaves can be slightly longer than its counterpart. Since a \"Juglans nigra\" and a \"Juglone\" will appear similarly to a Portland tree, the following is a statement that is false.\nOutput: A Portland tree would not be a \"Juglane\" since its leaves are shaped differently than a \"Juglane\".\n\nInput:This year, 2015, marks the one hundredth Anniversary of the beginning of World War I (or the Great War) and its start date was July 28th, 1914.

{"idx": 399, "text": "A\n\nAnswer the following questions based on the reading passage below:  \n\nIn 1986, Microsoft was founded by Paul Allen and Bill Gates.  Although their computers dominated the market, they did so primarily through legal means by using patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other legal tools to restrict how competitors could compete with them.  \n\nIn 2006, Microsoft, a company created to protect intellectual property, became the most fined company by a U.S. court of law.  Microsoft was accused of breaking antitrust laws by engaging in anti-competitive behavior.  Microsoft\u2019s goal was to become a monopoly and make money by restricting the free market, much like the early 20th century railroad trusts.  To help achieve this goal, Microsoft developed a product and then marketed it as an essential part of every computer in the world.  The product was Microsoft\u2019s operating system, Windows.  \n\nAfter the anti-competitive settlement, Microsoft became a company that was required by law to make their software compatible with competing products, but that\u2019s only the beginning of the change.  In addition, the new law required Microsoft to share trade secrets.  The idea behind this is that the more information they share, the harder it will be for other companies to achieve the same level of compatibility.  \n\nMicrosoft was also required to design its software to be compatible, and the court used an analogy from the railroad trusts to explain this:  \u201cthe Microsoft railroad car is the operating system, and the company\u2019s train is its software.\"  While Microsoft will design the car, they must design the train in such a way that it can be \"attached to any engine, at any time.  In addition, they must maintain it well enough so that it stays compatible with the engine, even though the engine is being built by a competing company.\u201d  This analogy requires Microsoft to design its systems in such a way that other products will work well with them, which is in stark contrast to the anti-competitve behavior in the past.  \n\nMicrosoft, a company that existed to restrict innovation by intellectual property, became a company required to innovate by opening intellectual property to the world.  The question is whether this change was good for Microsoft or good for the world.  The new laws required Microsoft to", "answer": "B: raise"}

And the camera used is a C++ class `VideoCapture` in this specific package, so we only need to check each member to find the answer!\n\nHere are the steps.\n\n**Step 1-1.** Print the available camera.\n\n```python:test\nfrom cv2 import __version__ as cv2_version\nimport cv2\n\ncv2.__version__\n\n# result\n'4.5.1'\n```\n\n`cv2.__version__` contains a version number of OpenCV for Python, and we have found the latest version so that we should not check if the answer is the newest!\n\nThen:\n\n```python test\nfor v in cv2.VideoCapture.available:\n    print(v)\n    cv2.VideoCaptrue(v).isOpened\n```\n\n**Step 2.** We find the information in `CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT`.\n\n```python test \nfor name, v in cv2.highgui.VideoCapture.__dict__().items():\n    print(name, v)\n```", "answer": "B: basement"}

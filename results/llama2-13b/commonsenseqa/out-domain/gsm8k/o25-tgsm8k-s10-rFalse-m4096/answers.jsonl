You're going to get more useful answers if you break it down into pieces and ask more focused questions about what is going wrong. Please ask a new question (click the \"ask question\" link in the navbar) for each specific problem you're having. Note that a number of these seem to belong on https://codereview.stackexchange.com rather than here.\n\nComment: [Here's](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) an excellent guide in how to create a proper minimal, reproducible example.\n\nComment: @CthulhuCodeFan I added an extra line\n\nAnswer: `answer` variables should not be declared.

Make sure you always declare in your function what inputs you're going to get.\n\n\\begin {code}\ndef getinput():\n  ...\n   return output\n\\end{code}.\n\nComment: Hey this looks pretty good.

Light travels at 299,792,458 meters per second. If you were on Mercury (which has a diameter slightly larger than that of Earth), then how much faster would you have to drive to \"keep up\" with the Earth and be at the same position relative to the Sun? Note that time is measured by the number of cycles a given event completes, like going around the Earth once, or going around the Earth once and back. So, if we were talking days or years, you would have to speed up so that Mercury and the Earth would complete the same number of circuits per each time-unit.

To be a bit nicer, you should consider using functions - they will help you to organize your logic (and code in general) better.\n\\item Your main problem is your use of `else` or `return` without testing against anything. It may happen that they will be executed even without fulfilling previous conditions, or even that they may be executed instead of other `if` conditions. You are making things really difficult for yourself.\n\\item I have seen answers based on the usage of `break` or `return` that would be executed as soon as any of them would fulfill the condition, even though they are not the last (e.g. your \"Boo-boo\" answer). These answers are also difficult because sometimes the last `if` condition is the same as the first one. This is not the case with your \"Cow Bells\" answer, but it is definitely easy to understand where you went wrong with your code.\n\\item There is little logic left. You are not asking the system to make \"sense\" out of the input. Instead, you are doing nothing but \"checking\" the input against pre-defined variables, which is absolutely pointless. You should try to make the logic more complex, since it still doesn't understand \"Boo-boos\" or \"Cow Bells\".\n\\item I'm not talking about the language you're using (Python3) here, because I'm not very familiar with it.

However I can say I was able to solve most of them but at the end of the day, after the test I went through reviewing my codes to make sure they were logical enough and well analyzed. These test really helped my understanding of python and its different ways of use. For me the challenge was in the input values sometimes the challenge made me think harder than normal.\n\n#### Questions:\n\n1.

(In your own words.)\n\n* When a pencil is placed above a magnet, it sticks to the magnet.\n\n* Magnets attract iron. (Nail)\n\n* Magnet will align with compass.\n\nOutput:\n\nMagnets and iron both have \"magnetic poles\" or ends to their magnetism that are called SOUTH and NORTH poles. They attract or repel each other depending on which poles' directions are facing one another. So if the bottom of the pencil is the North (N) pole and the magnet is the South (S) pole then it will stick together, if the top (S) of the pencil sticks to the north (N) pole on the magnet then it is repelled. The same is with the magnet and nail, as both have the north and south poles on both their ends. Therefore, the nail will be pulled towards the magnet. Similarly, the magnet will align with the compass as the earth also has a north and south magnetic pole in contrast to the magnetic north and south poles of the magnet itself.\n\nInput:Which two numbers, along with one additional number of your choice, multiply to 24 and add to zero?\n\n3, 4 and 5\n\nOutput:\n24 * 3 + 0,\n24 * 4 + 0\n24 * 5 + 0\nOutput:\n72 + 0, 96 + 0, 120 + 0\nOutput2:\n3*12, 4*12, 5*12\nOutput2:\n\nInput:The following problem can be solved either by factoring or adding.\n\n| x - 3 | = 11\n\n| x -", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

Like many immigrants at the time, Czechs and Slovaks went around to seek employment at farms to escape harsh times in their homeland and poverty. Many of them first came to America in the 1850’s, although many stayed where there was work in Chicago and other cities. At that time, they were mostly lumberjacks, construction workers and railroad builders. Czech and Slovak families began to settle in the U.S. in the latter 1840’s.

How does this function handle inputs of type `string` that are supplied as parameters?<n><n>### Explanation<n>```<n>const cashReceived = function (phoneBill, tip) {<n>  console.log(phoneBill * tip)<n>}<n>```<n>The way this function handles input of type `string` supplies is that we change the variable type to a string within the function. This will allow us to pass strings as parameters to the function.<n><n>### 3. For the given code below:<n><n>```javascript<n>const carName = 'VW'<n>console.log("carName = " + carName)<n>```<n><n>How do the carName and the string "VW" get used inside the function?<n><n>## Answer<n><n>The way that carName and the string `VG` get used inside the function is that they both get concatenated with the other string, so `console.log(carName + "VW")` would then spit out "VW". This is useful so we can print out the name of the car next to the VW that has been concatenated.<n><n>### Question:<n><n>#### 1.) What does this function expect to receive as parameters?<n><n>

Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n>Output:		D<n><n><n>###### Answer 1,2 and 3:<n>The ground is getting wet and we can see this with this word problem:<n><n>The first problem gives us a value from which to base out calculations, the value is 66. It is important to be able to figure out how to divide the total by two. 2x = 66<n><n>We can take 2x and multiply it by itself to get 4x^2 = 66x<n><n>Then we can take the square root of both sides to get x^2 = 16.5<n><n>So now we know how much each one person has, so we can take those values and divide them by 2 to get the amount that each person has for themselves, 34 candies for each person.<n><n>Now we can take that value and multiply it by the difference between their respective amounts to get the solution to the problem, 34-(8+16) = 34-(24) = 10<n><n>The second problem gives us this:<n><n>Local calls = 0.05 dollars per minute<n><n>International calls = 0.25 dollars per minute<n> <n>Duration 1 = 0.045 dollars<n><n>Duration 2 = 0.31 dollars<n><n>Total duration: 0.45 + 0.31 = 0.76<n><n>0.76 dollars per minute * 0.25 = 0.19 dollars per minute, which is 0.19/60 dollars per minute * 60 minutes = 1.14 dollars per minute<n><n>So for these two problems we simply divide one amount from the other, there is not any trickery to this, just math skill and reasoning.<n><n>The third problem is a little more difficult.<n>8 hours on Monday * 120 minutes is 8*120 = 960<n><n>We can add up this value with 5.5hours on tuesday, and we now have a value equal to 7 * 120 = 750.<n><n>We know that 5.5 hours is 60 minutes over 30 minutes, and since the first period was 30 minutes we can use that reasoning with the second period and make it 360 minutes.<n>So

In the following examples we have two basic data structures:<n><n>* Integer<n>* Array<n><n>Example:<n>```python<n># A simple python script<n>a = 1<n>b = 3<n>c = [2,1,4,3]<n>print(a, b, c)<n>```<n>Example output:<n>```<n>1 3 [2, 1, 4, 3]<n>```<n><n>### Functions: What is a function?<n><n>Whenever you run a function, you pass it arguments. Arguments could be numbers like 23, strings like "hi", or variables like a = 21. The function will then perform some sort of operation on the arguments.<n><n>### Recursion<n>```python<n>def my_recursive_fnc(arg):<n>   if true:<n>      return True<n>   else:<n>      return False<n>```<n>### Control Flow: <n>- For loops<n>- While loops<n>- If/else statements<n>- If/else if statements<n>- Ternary statements<n><n>### Data Collection Techniques<n><n>- Input: Asks for a user input, like a number, string or something else<n>- Console.WriteLine: prints some string to the screen, use if for debugging<n>- Console.Read();: Asks the user for an input<n>---<n><n>### Data Structures Explanation:<n>Arrays:<n>- An array is a collection of similar values stored at contiguous memory locations. The values of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations starting at address and continuing up to address + size. <n>- Arrays are often used to represent a list of items or to represent a matrix.<n>```<n>int[] someIntArray = new int[10];<n><n>```<n><n>---<n><n>Boolean:<n>A Boolean literal is a value that evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE. It is similar in use to the C language.<n><n>Boolean variables do not need to be declared, but they do need to have a data type:<n><n>```<n>int var1 = 3;<n>byte var2 =

That is impossible in many cases as you haven't provided any context about the assignment. See: [How to create a MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) and [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/). This question is not a good fit for Stack Overflow at the moment. Once you add details of what you have tried and provide us with a runnable [MCVE](https://stackoverflow/help/mcve), you will likely get better responses.<n><n>Answer: If you're familiar with the `BigInteger` class you could use it to make the solutions less likely

Tapanga has 38 more candies than his friend<n>2. Therefore in ratio x is 38 more than y. 38 : 1 = 38y/1 = 8y<n>3. Therefore total number of candies is 66 + 8y = 74Y. However Tapanga has 27 more candies than Coreay so. 8y = 27. 3y = 27/2. Y = 27/4 = 6. Therefore Corey Has 27 - 6 = 21 candies<n>4. In total, Freddie spent $10. A local call cost $0.05 and an international call cost $0.25. The rate for a local call is 65% of the rate for an international call. Set up an equation. 65% times how much is spent on international calls is $5. 100 percent times how much is spent local calls is $0.25 times $45 = $11.25. Therefore the answer is 65% or 0.65 times $11.24 = 0.65 x $11.2 = 7.28. The total amount spent on the phone call is therefore: 0.25

Then the program splits the lines of the input file into three parts, the question part, The answer part, and the answer key part. Then the program uses the dictionary to store the lines where the question part matches the name of the file. The problem with this is that the dictionary will hold the question as key and the whole line (`"""`), which is the line number (key) that matches the question name and the whole answer line as value. Then the program tries to iterate over the keys in this dictionary and iterate over the lines in the text file based on the key (number of the line that matches that part). it calls `get_question_key_index` to find the key index for that line of the input file. This function calculates the first index (`key_start_index`) of the key(part of the input text file) using the [`find`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find)builtin method for strings. This function also finds the length of the key using [`len`](https://docs.openstack.org/lumina-docs/latest/reference/api/python/lumina.html?highlight=len#lumina.len). After getting the first index `key_start_index` and the length of the key `len_key` we get the `index` of the key in the dictionary using the [`bisect`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.bisect.html?highlight=bisect) builtin function. Then using this index

In the lunch menu there are 4 categories. Each of you ordered 3 items on average. How many items in total did you order at the lunch table?<n>Output: 87<n><n># Solutions<n><n>The number of candies Freddy has is equal to Corey's number of candies plus 8. So we can rewrite this equation as: 8 = C - Tapanga_candies. Solving gives C = 33. Tappana has candies = 29.<n><n>**Example**2.<n><n>The number of minutes Freddy spent talking on New Year's eve is equal to 45 minutes + 31 - 5 * 90. The number of international minutes is equal to 31 minutes and the number of local minutes is 90. So we can rewrite the equation as: (x + 31) - 5 *90 = 10. Solving yields the solution: x - 450 = 10 which is: x = 450 + 10 = 460.<n><n>**Example 3.**<n><n>The number of hours is equal to 4 * 8 + 5.5 * 2 - 8 * 5.5. To solve this we can equate the number of hours Freddy works each day to n and rearrange it in the terms of n. So we can write 4 * 8 = n * 2 which is: 8 = 2 * n. Then n - 4 = 5.5 which is: n = 6.65. The correct solution is 6.<n><n>**Example4.**<n><n>The problem statement gives the total number of books Ali had before the sale i.e. 800. It then subtracts the amount of books sold and tells us how many books were not sold. However, the answer given is 600. But, this answer is wrong as 600 books were never in Ali's possession. So, clearly there is something missing in the question statement.<n><n>The books were 4 days old. Ali had the books in the week starting from Monday and continuing to the next four days. On the other hand

It accepts tokens and generates a data structure.<n>    There's nothing about a parser that's specific to programming languages.<n>    That's why it's used by a variety of applications such as regular expression editors, lexical analyzers for compilers, pattern matchers,<n>    etc.  Parsers are used for a variety of things because parsing is what is needed in general.<n>    You have got to parse in order to produce some output.<n>    The language interpreter is just one example of an application of a parser, and a very specialized application in that.<n>    It's not what is usually done by a parser.<n>    There aren't any special limitations other than the fact that the input lexer, you have to produce the tokens in the right order to be a good lexer.<n>But that's not really a limitation as the language itself is what it is, you just have to follow it and that shouldn't be too difficult.<n>    - Given the following program segment, can you interpret the code?<n><n>    int main() {<n>        printf("hello, world!"); //0-based indexing<n>    }<n>-----------------<n>    It would be interpreted as hello, world!<n>-----------------<n>    - Does a recursive descent parser allow for better performance compared to a LL(k) parser? <n>    Recursion is not as fast as LL(k) which is one of the major disadvantages of recursive descent. It has to call a subroutine to<n>    process what has been matched. Each time you call a subroutine, you pay the overhead of the call.<n>    But that's not usually the major problem with recursive descent. It's got its main drawback and that's the fact that recursion<n>    itself is very difficult to implement efficiently in most programming languages.<n>    What is a recursive function? It returns the value, it returns what it returns. Does that make sense?<n>    It's very difficult to really understand recursion fully even for experienced programmers.<n>    It' is often the case that recursion makes programs faster but it's also the case that recursion generally results is longer<n>    programs and code.<n>

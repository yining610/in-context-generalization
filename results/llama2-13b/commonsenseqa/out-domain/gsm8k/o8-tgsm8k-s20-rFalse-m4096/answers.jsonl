What are some potential health concerns that result from ingestion of these contaminants?\n\n>Chlorinated solvents such as PCE, TCE, BTEX, and solvents that were used historically on Marine Bases pose a health threat. PCE (tetrachloroethlyene) can cause kidney and liver damage, which may result in death.\n\nChlorinated solvnets that may have been used in other common cleaning purposes in the past including dry cleaning and degreasing purposes can cause health problems. Some of these solvents are PCE (tetracloroethylene) which is a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) and can cause kidney and/or liver injury that may be fatal. Chloroform can cause nervous system depression and kidney and liver dysfunction.\n\nChlorobenze (benzene) causes kidney and liver problems and can also cause cancer.\n\nChloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE) and vinyl chloride (VCA) are known to cause cancer.\n\nTCE (trichloroethylene), DCE (dichloroethylne), vinyl chloride, and chloroform are all carcinogens that have been linked to health concerns.\n\nVinyl chloride can cause reproductive issues, immune system issues, respiratory system problems, and liver problems.\n\n>Aside from the health risks involved, the issue is very controversial. The VA was sued for failing to notify Marines and Civilian employees of these known health risks.\n\n>The 2012 law known as the Janey Ensminger Act was passed by Congress and it called for the VA to provide more comprehensive Health Care for Marines who have been in contact with contaminated water.\n\n>Many Marines and Civilians have been affected by these toxic chemical", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

On a separate day, there are 40 students taking a test. How many students passed the class if 45 students passed the test?\n\n\nFirst, count the total number of students who were not allowed to pass a single class(those who didn't take the test): \n\n```\n\nTotal number of students taking a test in class = 50\n\n```\n\n\nThis is the same number of students who did not take the test because they didn't pass. In fact, if anyone passes the first challenge, they will fail the second one.\n\nWe can then say that the number of students who cannot pass the test is:\n\n```\n\n50 - 45 = 5\n\n```\n\nSecond, counting the number of students that were not allowed to pass their second semester exam. \n\n\n```\n5 - 4\n\n4\n```\n\n\nThird, the number of students who passed. \n\n\nAs a result, everyone who passed either had an average of 60 percent above that grade, so the number of students who failed was five, and two students who passed their second round of testing, a total of seven.", "answer": "B: feel good"}

Like many immigrants at the time, Czechs and Slovaks went around to seek employment at farms to escape harsh times in their homeland and poverty. Many of them first came to America in the 1850\u2019s, although many stayed where there was work in Chicago and other cities. At that time, they were mostly lumberjacks, construction workers and railroad builders. Czech and Slovak families began to settle in the U.S. in the latter 1840\u2019s. In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a small town settled mostly by Bohemians (Czechs), the first school was built and opened in January of 1852. The school was built by the people themselves. They raised funds and built a small wooden schoolhouse. The community had a few families and a few hundred people in total.

How does this function handle inputs of type `string` that are supplied as parameters?\n\n### Explanation\n```\nconst cashReceived = function (phoneBill, tip) {\n  console.log(phoneBill * tip)\n}\n```\nThe way this function handles input of type `string` supplies is that we change the variable type to a string within the function. This will allow us to pass strings as parameters to the function.\n\n### 3. For the given code below:\n\n```javascript\nconst carName = 'VW'\nconsole.log(\"carName = \" + carName)\n```\n\nHow do the carName and the string \"VW\" get used inside the function?\n\n## Answer\n\nThe way that carName and the string `VG` get used inside the function is that they both get concatenated with the other string, so `console.log(carName + \"VW\")` would then spit out \"VW\". This is useful so we can print out the name of the car next to the VW that has been concatenated.\n\n### Question:\n\n#### 1.) What does this function expect to receive as parameters?", "answer": "B: home"}

{"idx": 388, "text": "D\n\n\n###### Answer 1,2 and 3:\nThe ground is getting wet and we can see this with this word problem:\n\nThe first problem gives us a value from which to base out calculations, the value is 66. It is important to be able to figure out how to divide the total by two. 2x = 66\n\nWe can take 2x and multiply it by itself to get 4x^2 = 66x\n\nThen we can take the square root of both sides to get x^2 = 16.5\n\nSo now we know how much each one person has, so we can take those values and divide them by 2 to get the amount that each person has for themselves, 34 candies for each person.\n\nNow we can take that value and multiply it by the difference between their respective amounts to get the solution to the problem, 34-(8+16) = 34-(24) = 10\n\nThe second problem gives us this:\n\nLocal calls = 0.05 dollars per minute\n\nInternational calls = 0.25 dollars per minute\n \nDuration 1 = 0.045 dollars\n\nDuration 2 = 0.31 dollars\n\nTotal duration: 0.45 + 0.31 = 0.76\n\n0.76 dollars per minute * 0.25 = 0.19 dollars per minute, which is 0.19/60 dollars per minute * 60 minutes = 1.14 dollars per minute\n\nSo for these two problems we simply divide one amount from the other, there is not any trickery to this, just math skill and reasoning.\n\nThe third problem is a little more difficult.\n8 hours on Monday * 120 minutes is 8*120 = 960\n\nWe can add up this value with 5.5hours on tuesday, and we now have a value equal to 7 * 120 = 750.\n\nWe know that 5.5 hours is 60 minutes over 30 minutes, and since the first period was 30 minutes we can use that reasoning with the second period and make it 360 minutes.\nSo", "answer": "B: melting"}

Answer the 4 previous questions correctly to be awarded 1 point.\n\n### Data structures\n\nData structures consist of variables of different data types and instructions (functions) that help the program perform certain tasks based. In the following examples we have two basic data structures:\n\n* Integer\n* Array\n\nExample:\n```python\n# A simple python script\na = 1\nb = 3\nc = [2,1,4,3]\nprint(a, b, c)\n```\nExample output:\n```\n1 3 [2, 1, 4, 3]\n```\n\n### Functions: What is a function?\n\nWhenever you run a function, you pass it arguments. Arguments could be numbers like 23, strings like \"hi\", or variables like a = 21. The function will then perform some sort of operation on the arguments.\n\n### Recursion\n```python\ndef my_recursive_fnc(arg):\n   if true:\n      return True\n   else:\n      return False\n```\n### Control Flow: \n- For loops\n- While loops\n- If/else statements\n- If/else if statements\n- Ternary statements\n\n### Data Collection Techniques\n\n- Input: Asks for a user input, like a number, string or something else\n- Console.WriteLine: prints some string to the screen, use if for debugging\n- Console.Read();: Asks the user for an input\n---\n\n### Data Structures Explanation:\nArrays:\n- An array is a collection of similar values stored at contiguous memory locations. The values of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations starting at address and continuing up to address + size. \n- Arrays are often used to represent a list of items or to represent a matrix.\n```\nint[] someIntArray = new int[10];\n\n```\n\n---\n\nBoolean:\nA Boolean literal is a value that evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE. It is similar in use to the C language.\n\nBoolean variables do not need to be declared, but they do need to have a data type:\n\n```\nint var1 = 3;\nbyte var2 =", "answer": "E: score points"}

Then the program splits the lines of the input file into three parts, the question part, The answer part, and the answer key part. Then the program uses the dictionary to store the lines where the question part matches the name of the file. The problem with this is that the dictionary will hold the question as key and the whole line (`\"\"\"`), which is the line number (key) that matches the question name and the whole answer line as value. Then the program tries to iterate over the keys in this dictionary and iterate over the lines in the text file based on the key (number of the line that matches that part). it calls `get_question_key_index` to find the key index for that line of the input file. This function calculates the first index (`key_start_index`) of the key(part of the input text file) using the [`find`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find)builtin method for strings. This function also finds the length of the key using [`len`](https://docs.openstack.org/lumina-docs/latest/reference/api/python/lumina.html?highlight=len#lumina.len). After getting the first index `key_start_index` and the length of the key `len_key` we get the `index` of the key in the dictionary using the [`bisect`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.bisect.html?highlight=bisect) builtin function.

If Tapanga is younger than Corey, find the difference. \n\n```\nInput: Tapaga = 8 and Corey = 10 \nOutput: Tapanga is two years younger than Corey (10 - 8 = 2). \n\nInput: Tapeanga = 10 and Corey = 8 \nOutput: Tapeanga is 2 years younger than Corey. \n```\n\n--- \n\n**Explanation**: \n\nIn this case, you can directly use an array as they both do not contain many numbers.\n\nWe need a function to receive two numbers as input and we need to find whether the first number is greater than the second one or vice versa.\n\nThe easiest way is to use \"if\" and \"return\".\n\nHere is the code.\n\n```java \npackage com.java.javaexpo; \n \npublic class Code {    \n \n // Function to find the difference between two numbers. \n \n public static int findDifference(int a, int b) { \n \n \t// If a is greater than b, return 1. \n \n  if (a > b) return 1; \n \n   // If a is less than b, return -1. \n \tif (a < b) return -1; \n \t\n return 0; \n \n } \n \n // Driver method. \n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) { \n\t\n\t int a = 8; \n\t int b = 10; \n\t \n\t System.out.println(findDifference(a, b)); \n\t \n } \n} \n```\n\nHere we define a function called findDifference(). We will pass two integers in this function.\n\nThen, we check whether a is greater than b or vise-versa. If it is so, we return 1, -1 for small and large numbers respectively", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

How many items in total did you order at the lunch table?\nOutput: 87\n\n# Solutions\n\nThe number of candies Freddy has is equal to Corey's number of candies plus 8. So we can rewrite this equation as: 8 = C - Tapanga_candies. Solving gives C = 33. Tappana has candies = 29.\n\n**Example**2.\n\nThe number of minutes Freddy spent talking on New Year's eve is equal to 45 minutes + 31 - 5 * 90. The number of international minutes is equal to 31 minutes and the number of local minutes is 90. So we can rewrite the equation as: (x + 31) - 5 *90 = 10. Solving yields the solution: x - 450 = 10 which is: x = 450 + 10 = 460.\n\n**Example 3.**\n\nThe number of hours is equal to 4 * 8 + 5.5 * 2 - 8 * 5.5. To solve this we can equate the number of hours Freddy works each day to n and rearrange it in the terms of n. So we can write 4 * 8 = n * 2 which is: 8 = 2 * n. Then n - 4 = 5.5 which is: n = 6.65. The correct solution is 6.\n\n**Example4.**\n\nThe problem statement gives the total number of books Ali had before the sale i.e. 800. It then subtracts the amount of books sold and tells us how many books were not sold. However, the answer given is 600. But, this answer is wrong as 600 books were never in Ali's possession. So, clearly there is something missing in the question statement.\n\nThe books were 4 days old. Ali had the books in the week starting from Monday and continuing to the next four days.

{"idx": 932, "text": "D\n\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below\n\n    - What are some of the limitations in writing a language interpreter which uses a tokenizer and parser?\nA parser is really only a tool. It accepts tokens and generates a data structure.\n    There's nothing about a parser that's specific to programming languages.\n    That's why it's used by a variety of applications such as regular expression editors, lexical analyzers for compilers, pattern matchers,\n    etc.  Parsers are used for a variety of things because parsing is what is needed in general.\n    You have got to parse in order to produce some output.\n    The language interpreter is just one example of an application of a parser, and a very specialized application in that.\n    It's not what is usually done by a parser.\n    There aren't any special limitations other than the fact that the input lexer, you have to produce the tokens in the right order to be a good lexer.\nBut that's not really a limitation as the language itself is what it is, you just have to follow it and that shouldn't be too difficult.\n    - Given the following program segment, can you interpret the code?\n\n    int main() {\n        printf(\"hello, world!\"); //0-based indexing\n    }\n-----------------\n    It would be interpreted as hello, world!\n-----------------\n    - Does a recursive descent parser allow for better performance compared to a LL(k) parser? \n    Recursion is not as fast as LL(k) which is one of the major disadvantages of recursive descent. It has to call a subroutine to\n    process what has been matched. Each time you call a subroutine, you pay the overhead of the call.\n    But that's not usually the major problem with recursive descent. It's got its main drawback and that's the fact that recursion\n    itself is very difficult to implement efficiently in most programming languages.\n    What is a recursive function? It returns the value, it returns what it returns. Does that make sense?\n    It's very difficult to really understand recursion fully even for experienced programmers.\n    It' is often the case that recursion makes programs faster but it's also the case that recursion generally results is longer\n    programs and code.", "answer": "D: school"}

You can use arrays if you have a more complex problem and you think you will need to sort, reorder, or iterate through a lot of values within the problem. This is a common way to store values we want to retrieve later in the problem and can significantly reduce the amount of times we have to process the values. Arrays, when used properly, can speed up a program\u2019s performance or its efficiency.\n\n# Instructions:\n\nInstructions: In Problems 1 through 8, write a JavaScript program that defines multiple arrays. Use this program to answer the associated number question in each task.\n\n1- Create an Array called 'A' to be used in Problems 1-3. The Array should have the first name of each student.\n2- Create an Array called \u2018B\u2019 to be used in Problem 4.\n3- Create an Array called C to be used in Problem to be used in Problem Problem 5\n4- Create an Array called D to be used in Problem  4 to be used in Problem\n4 to be used inProblem 4\n5- Create an Array called E to be used in ProblemProblem 5\n4-5 toProblem be used in Problem 5\n\n# Problem 1-8\n1- Write a function called SumNames() that prints out the first names of all the students in array 'A' and determines the sum of the first letters in each first name.\n2- Write a function called MaxScore() that prints out the names of all the students and determines the highest score in the class.\n3- Write a function called ClassAverage() that determines the mean score of all the students in class A.\n4- Write a function called MinGrade() that determines the lowest grade in the class.\n5- Write a function called SpellingCount() that determines the number of students who scored 200 or less on the spelling test and prints this amount.\n6- Write a function called HighEasey() that determines the student with the highest average that is also in the Easy class.\n7- Write a function called LowAverage() that determins the student in Class A with the lowest average score.\n8- Write a function called CutoffScore() that outputs a", "answer": "A: sail boats"}

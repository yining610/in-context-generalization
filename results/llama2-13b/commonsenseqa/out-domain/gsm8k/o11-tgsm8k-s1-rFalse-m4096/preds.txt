To put it another way, it would require<n>a person to have in order of 4 trillion dollars in order to obtain such a figure. As for why it is free, it’s not an easy<n>task to answer. It is almost like a double-edged sword. I mean, it is technically free. When you type into a search bar,<n>it gives you almost every result from the internet but it’s the things behind the scenes that people don’t give attention to<n>that are the money makers. As an example, Google collects search history information. The amount of data the company<n>has collected over time is staggering. Google has billions of searches daily. You see, to make Google, an advertiser needs<n>to enter a keyword. They will pay Google between $1 and $2, per hour. Google is making money from the users, but that’s<n>it. This is because by law, Google has to collect personal information from the user. It is the law that companies<n>have to adhere to these regulations for legal purposes, and, in case of a court trial the business can be held liable for<n>breaking the laws of any of the localities or states in which they do business. The thing some people don’t really take into<n>account is the fact that we pay for these services. To explain further, I have a couple of examples. I have a friend that says<n>he’s a prolific user of YouTube. He says that “If I wanted to take this time and do something else, I would need, let’s say,<n>8 hours which would take me the entire day. By spending that time I could get paid by my boss.

So, I need to ask the input once, and I can assume that the remaining sticker is the input which is 89, minus 3 large stickers (3 large stickers means I need to multiply the input by 3), minus 7 small stickers which mean I need to divide the input by 7.<n><n>For the second one, I read that the code must output the number of dollar bills he has remaining. So we know the allowance is $5, extra money he has is $10, and he'll babysit for 2 hours, which means 2 days of after he mows his lawn. So, we need to store the values and subtract them.  The same process goes into the next one, where it was about how much money we need to spend before we can buy that bike. I read the code, the user will buy the bike as soon as he gets the allowance on Friday, so the user would need the extra money. Then, just need to ask him how many hours he would work, which means multiply his allowance number we get from Friday by the number of hours and subtract the total he needs to get bike.<n><n>As for the last two, it will be a bit different from the others. I read the last two questions, it says "the total number of legs". The reason why I say this question is "different" from the other questions is that it involves the number of legs, which is an unknown variable. So, I first need

The first one is all the integers that satisfy `if number between 1 and 6  and number is divisible by 3`.  From there we just have to check how many values we got. As seen above, this is pretty intuitive to do so. After making the lists and calculating their sizes, we see that the first list will have 4 values and the second will have 1. So we'll just find the sum of both lists together, and boom we're done!<n><n>### Complexity: O(N) which makes us be under the O(ln(N)) constraint.<n>

You can write [Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/python-programming-examples/scrape-web-page-python) to parse the page and extract the problem data. This solution will save you a ton of time since you won't have to reimplement the problems yourself. There is a lot of functionality and features that you won't get from scraping, for example when asking LeetCode a problem it will give you a score per time with a description (how long did the problem take, what % of people solved it) which are great for statistical analysis.<n><n>\strong{edit:} I apologize: I made a mistake. You can use the [GraphQL API](https://leetcodedoc.dev/#variables) documented in the second link above to scape LeetCode directly, but not the REST API.

He can now spend $15 on Saturday plus he has already saved $65, all together he will have spend $70 before he can buy the $100 bike, so his answer is $30.  <n><n>Mark has two kangaroos (2 legs) and three times as many as kangaroos, so if he has 23 + 3 x 4, he will have 13 times 4 legs.  <n><n>Mark's dogs have 3 times more legs than his kangaroos, and each dog has 4 legs, so if his dogs have 12 legs, he will have 3 times more (4 x 4) legs in total, and his answer is 12 x 3 = 36.<n><n>If each cookie costs $1, the money to buy 4 cookies is $4 as well as $20, therefore the leftover money is $20 - $2 = $18.<n><n>George's team must be 1 more points above their average to tie the league highest.  His team averages 287 per game, and he must get at least 288 per game to tie, so his average per play in the final round must be 288/4 = 72.  The rest of the players must get 72 as well, for the league best total of 280 x 4 = 1,120.

The square root of a number, which is denoted by √x, means we take the number and find the square root, positive or negative. For example, √35 is positive 6 and √(124) is 11<n>2.	A square root of a negative number cannot have an integer, or whole number, for an answer. For example, the square root of a -4 is not -2 but rather about 2.155135113469298.<n>3.	The smallest number that can be added to any integer to get a positive number is called the opposite of the integer. For example, the opposite of -20 is 20<n>4.	When multiplying, the order of the numbers does not matter; any set of products is equal to each other. For example, 3×4=4×3<n>5.	When multiplying out fractions, it is important to remember that when two fractions are multiplied by each other, the order does not change; only the numerators are added together and the denominators are multiplied together. Therefore, 3x½ = ½ x ½ = 1x3x2 =6.<n>6.	When multiplying decimals, the product is a decimal, and the decimal point must be aligned properly. The same rule applies when multiplying decimal fractions. For example, 2.5×1.3 = 0.5 x 0.3 = 0x15= 3<n>7.	When multiplying mixed numbers, first convert both numbers to improper fractions and then multiply. For example, 1½ x 5¼ = 1x5 +1x2 =1x1+5 x 1 x 2 = 10.<n>8.	When adding fractions with identical numerators and different denominators, add the numerators and place the results over the highest common denominator, or HCD. For example, .5+.75/12 =.5 +.75/4 =.5 + 5/4 = 3/4.<n>9.	When adding two fractions with different numerators and identical denominators, add the fractions and write the answer as a mixed

Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n>Output:		D<n><n>Input: The human looked down longingly, what was he missing?<n><n><n><n><n>Instruction for solving:<n>We can see that the pattern behind the questions is the following: 3 choices, three possibilities. Each question has a pattern and there are no other possibilities, so we must be given at least 3 choices per question. <n>We see that in some questions, the word "not" can be omitted in the multiple choice question. <n>For example, in the answer, the question might have said "What is NOT a possibility on the surface of Earth?"  The answer would have been A.  If this is the case, we need to look at the other options and omit the possibility based on the ones we can choose that weren't the answers.  So in this case, when we saw "nearest house", we knew it couldn't be B. So A and C we're only two left. Then we can eliminate answer C, because on the surface of earth, we have cities. <n>There is not only one possible option. <n>To solve, we see the following pattern:<n><n>If the question asks "What _____ is missing," we need to see the list of possible answers and see what has been ommitted based on that. <n><n>If the question is: "What does NOT _______?" we need to see all the possible answers and see what was left out.<n><n><n>

Input Validation is not tested as much as other computer science concepts. In my opinion, its importance is often overlooked.<n><n>To be able to answer this question, we used a "debugging" code to check the values of the variables for the answers we need.<n>```<n>```<n>var q1 = "What is 1 + 1?";<n>console.log(q1);<n>var q1a = "What is 2 + 1?"; console.log(q1a);<n>var q1b = 3; console.log(q2b);<n>```<n>What is the problem here? This is a "type" error. q1b is supposed to equal "3" but the console.log() returns "undefined".<n><n>Why is this happening? The code assumes that `q1b` is a string because we used quotation marks to call the variable in `console.log()`<n><n>How do you fix this? use brackets to call the variable.<n>```<n>  var q2a = 1 + "2";<n>  console.log(q3a);<n>``` <n>The result this time is correct. "3" is printed in the console.<n><n>The example above does not seem very useful, but it serves its purpose. How do we expect the computer to respond to the code we've entered? We often give our programs a lot of room to fail. If this is how we interact with computers in our day to day lives, we create a culture of frustrated computer users.<n><n>What do we do to address this issue?  we've learned to double check with brackets for all variables we use that can also be numbers.<n><n>### Writing Functions<n><n>One of our projects involved writing a function with 5 arguments. The code needed to work regardless of the order in which the arguments were passed. As programmers, we know that we control what arguments are passed to our program. However, when writing functions with more than one argument, we must not assume how the arguments will be supplied. We have complete control over what arguments are passed to the function. By default, functions work according to the

You can also also write:<n>```javascript <n> x = 0<n> ```<n> Which evaluates to `false`. <n><n>**Note that integers, floats and boolean are the objects created by JavaScript.**<n><n>You can use `typeof` to check what type of object you have. This will always yield a `string` which you can compare against.<n><n>Let's now look at some more questions.<n>

Please try to format the list with *one answer per line*, not per multiple lines in the same line. Please use back ticks to properly display variables and code/syntax in the question.<n><n>Comment: Also, when asking a question, we recommend that you provide a small sample of data that reflects the type/range of input you can reasonably expect. This allows us to provide a better answer that isn't specific to your exact values.<n><n>Answer: You can use `eval` to turn your answer text into code. In the loop, you create a new string that contains that code.  For example<n><n>\begin{code}<n>for i in input:<n>     code = eval(i)<n>\end{code}<n><n>But that is not reliable. You would need to make sure the input is sensible (no spaces, only letters and numbers) But you could also have any expression there you want.<n><n>Comment: what will be the syntax for that? sorry, I am noob in Python<n><n>Comment: It sounds like you want a syntax that allows you to use variables. Is that correct?  For example, the problem is `input = "my age is 23 and i have 6 books."` and you would define your code like `my_age` and `nb_books`. Do you want to write "my" age is?

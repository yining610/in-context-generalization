To put it another way, it would require\na person to have in order of 4 trillion dollars in order to obtain such a figure. As for why it is free, it\u2019s not an easy\ntask to answer. It is almost like a double-edged sword. I mean, it is technically free. When you type into a search bar,\nit gives you almost every result from the internet but it\u2019s the things behind the scenes that people don\u2019t give attention to\nthat are the money makers. As an example, Google collects search history information. The amount of data the company\nhas collected over time is staggering. Google has billions of searches daily. You see, to make Google, an advertiser needs\nto enter a keyword. They will pay Google between $1 and $2, per hour. Google is making money from the users, but that\u2019s\nit. This is because by law, Google has to collect personal information from the user. It is the law that companies\nhave to adhere to these regulations for legal purposes, and, in case of a court trial the business can be held liable for\nbreaking the laws of any of the localities or states in which they do business. The thing some people don\u2019t really take into\naccount is the fact that we pay for these services. To explain further, I have a couple of examples. I have a friend that says\nhe\u2019s a prolific user of YouTube. He says that \u201cIf I wanted to take this time and do something else, I would need, let\u2019s say,\n8 hours which would take me the entire day.

So, I need to ask the input once, and I can assume that the remaining sticker is the input which is 89, minus 3 large stickers (3 large stickers means I need to multiply the input by 3), minus 7 small stickers which mean I need to divide the input by 7.\n\nFor the second one, I read that the code must output the number of dollar bills he has remaining. So we know the allowance is $5, extra money he has is $10, and he'll babysit for 2 hours, which means 2 days of after he mows his lawn. So, we need to store the values and subtract them.  The same process goes into the next one, where it was about how much money we need to spend before we can buy that bike. I read the code, the user will buy the bike as soon as he gets the allowance on Friday, so the user would need the extra money. Then, just need to ask him how many hours he would work, which means multiply his allowance number we get from Friday by the number of hours and subtract the total he needs to get bike.\n\nAs for the last two, it will be a bit different from the others. I read the last two questions, it says \"the total number of legs\". The reason why I say this question is \"different\" from the other questions is that it involves the number of legs, which is an unknown variable. So, I first need", "answer": "C: progress"}

The first one is all the integers that satisfy `if number between 1 and 6  and number is divisible by 3`.  From there we just have to check how many values we got. As seen above, this is pretty intuitive to do so. After making the lists and calculating their sizes, we see that the first list will have 4 values and the second will have 1. So we'll just find the sum of both lists together, and boom we're done!\n\n### Complexity: O(N) which makes us be under the O(ln(N)) constraint.", "answer": "D: death"}

The [REST API Documentation](https://leetcoderepo.github.io/doc-api-v4.html) is very helpful if you follow the instructions to sign up or sign in, and you'll be able to access the various problems in the LeetCode repository. You can write [Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/python-programming-examples/scrape-web-page-python) to parse the page and extract the problem data. This solution will save you a ton of time since you won't have to reimplement the problems yourself. There is a lot of functionality and features that you won't get from scraping, for example when asking LeetCode a problem it will give you a score per time with a description (how long did the problem take, what % of people solved it) which are great for statistical analysis.\n\n\\strong{edit:} I apologize: I made a mistake. You can use the [GraphQL API](https://leetcodedoc.dev/#variables) documented in the second link above to scape LeetCode directly, but not the REST API.

The word \u201ctree\u201d in this context is used broadly. It could refer to a binary search tree, a B-tree, an n-ary tree, etc. We will discuss general tree algorithms and leave more specific applications to be discussed in later sections.\n\nA tree is often represented in computer science by the mathematical definition of a tree: a tree is a connected graph which is maximum.

{"idx": 719, "text": "D: dinner\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below.\n\n1.\tThe square root of a number, which is denoted by \u221ax, means we take the number and find the square root, positive or negative. For example, \u221a35 is positive 6 and \u221a(124) is 11\n2.\tA square root of a negative number cannot have an integer, or whole number, for an answer. For example, the square root of a -4 is not -2 but rather about 2.155135113469298.\n3.\tThe smallest number that can be added to any integer to get a positive number is called the opposite of the integer. For example, the opposite of -20 is 20\n4.\tWhen multiplying, the order of the numbers does not matter; any set of products is equal to each other. For example, 3\u00d74=4\u00d73\n5.\tWhen multiplying out fractions, it is important to remember that when two fractions are multiplied by each other, the order does not change; only the numerators are added together and the denominators are multiplied together. Therefore, 3x\u00bd = \u00bd x \u00bd = 1x3x2 =6.\n6.\tWhen multiplying decimals, the product is a decimal, and the decimal point must be aligned properly. The same rule applies when multiplying decimal fractions. For example, 2.5\u00d71.3 = 0.5 x 0.3 = 0x15= 3\n7.\tWhen multiplying mixed numbers, first convert both numbers to improper fractions and then multiply. For example, 1\u00bd x 5\u00bc = 1x5 +1x2 =1x1+5 x 1 x 2 = 10.\n8.\tWhen adding fractions with identical numerators and different denominators, add the numerators and place the results over the highest common denominator, or HCD. For example, .5+.75/12 =.5 +.75/4 =.5 + 5/4 = 3/4.\n9.\tWhen adding two fractions with different numerators and identical denominators, add the fractions and write the answer as a mixed", "answer": "D: dinner"}

Each question has a pattern and there are no other possibilities, so we must be given at least 3 choices per question. \nWe see that in some questions, the word \"not\" can be omitted in the multiple choice question. \nFor example, in the answer, the question might have said \"What is NOT a possibility on the surface of Earth?\"  The answer would have been A.  If this is the case, we need to look at the other options and omit the possibility based on the ones we can choose that weren't the answers.  So in this case, when we saw \"nearest house\", we knew it couldn't be B. So A and C we're only two left. Then we can eliminate answer C, because on the surface of earth, we have cities. \nThere is not only one possible option. \nTo solve, we see the following pattern:\n\nIf the question asks \"What _____ is missing,\" we need to see the list of possible answers and see what has been ommitted based on that. \n\nIf the question is: \"What does NOT _______?\" we need to see all the possible answers and see what was left out.", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

Input Validation is not tested as much as other computer science concepts. In my opinion, its importance is often overlooked.\n\nTo be able to answer this question, we used a \"debugging\" code to check the values of the variables for the answers we need.\n```\n```\nvar q1 = \"What is 1 + 1?\";\nconsole.log(q1);\nvar q1a = \"What is 2 + 1?\"; console.log(q1a);\nvar q1b = 3; console.log(q2b);\n```\nWhat is the problem here? This is a \"type\" error. q1b is supposed to equal \"3\" but the console.log() returns \"undefined\".\n\nWhy is this happening? The code assumes that `q1b` is a string because we used quotation marks to call the variable in `console.log()`\n\nHow do you fix this? use brackets to call the variable.\n```\n  var q2a = 1 + \"2\";\n  console.log(q3a);\n``` \nThe result this time is correct. \"3\" is printed in the console.\n\nThe example above does not seem very useful, but it serves its purpose. How do we expect the computer to respond to the code we've entered? We often give our programs a lot of room to fail. If this is how we interact with computers in our day to day lives, we create a culture of frustrated computer users.\n\nWhat do we do to address this issue?  we've learned to double check with brackets for all variables we use that can also be numbers.\n\n### Writing Functions\n\nOne of our projects involved writing a function with 5 arguments. The code needed to work regardless of the order in which the arguments were passed. As programmers, we know that we control what arguments are passed to our program. However, when writing functions with more than one argument, we must not assume how the arguments will be supplied. We have complete control over what arguments are passed to the function. By default, functions work according to the", "answer": "D: underground"}

You can also also write:\n```javascript \n x = 0\n ```\n Which evaluates to `false`. \n\n**Note that integers, floats and boolean are the objects created by JavaScript.**\n\nYou can use `typeof` to check what type of object you have.

Please try to format the list with *one answer per line*, not per multiple lines in the same line. Please use back ticks to properly display variables and code/syntax in the question.\n\nComment: Also, when asking a question, we recommend that you provide a small sample of data that reflects the type/range of input you can reasonably expect. This allows us to provide a better answer that isn't specific to your exact values.\n\nAnswer: You can use `eval` to turn your answer text into code. In the loop, you create a new string that contains that code.  For example\n\n\\begin{code}\nfor i in input:\n     code = eval(i)\n\\end{code}\n\nBut that is not reliable. You would need to make sure the input is sensible (no spaces, only letters and numbers) But you could also have any expression there you want.\n\nComment: what will be the syntax for that? sorry, I am noob in Python\n\nComment: It sounds like you want a syntax that allows you to use variables. Is that correct?  For example, the problem is `input = \"my age is 23 and i have 6 books.\"` and you would define your code like `my_age` and `nb_books`.

However, some of the questions are relatively long and are in the realm of an essay exam. Because of that, we decided to come up with a python script to automate the scanner and give you detailed answers directly on your browser!\n\n# Running the Python Script\n\nIn order for this program to run on a desktop, it requires a scanner with a file format of 'PDF' or 'TIFF' and also the Python interpreter (3+) to be installed. If you do not have these, you can alternatively upload an image using the Python library PIL to transform the picture into grayscale.\n\nIn order to run this program, you need to first enter in your data and images into a file with the extension 'txt', and place it in the same folder as the python file. Open command line and run the script by typing in in the terminal: python3 <python file location>.  The program generates different files (i.e. img.jpg ) in the folder location as it goes. Make sure that the folder has permission to read and write.\n\n# Description of the Program\n\nThe program works by creating thumbnail images from the pages of the image scanner. We loop through the images on the webpage and resize and scale them down to a much smaller size. The images are then cropped and stored onto a single image which has the name'scanned'. This picture is then compared to three pictures in the folder.\n\nWe have the answers to each of these questions in the form of 'correct' and 'wrong'. The 'correct' images are stored in files whose names are the numbers of the corresponding question's choices. Whenever the script finds an image that roughly fits the scanned image, the program counts through a series of choices until it finds the correct one. If a match is found, the program prints out an answer, otherwise, it repeats the same process", "answer": "E: airplane"}

In mathematics, the **n**umbers involve **o**perations that are **a**rithmetical in nature.\n\nThe question will give you an input amount of kilograms (3 kg) and the cost of one kilogram of nuts ($12). We then proceed to ask the cost of *one kilogram of dried fruits*\n\nThe question wants you to compute the *sum* of the the costs of `12+9 = 21`\n\n<img src=\"assets/images/0105.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\">\n\n###### Parts 2 & 3:\n\nFor the second question, we have *ratios*, proportions, and unit rates. The key idea is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{1 Hour}}{3} = \\frac{1/3}{\\text{3 Hours}}\n$$\n\nWe then multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to obtain:\n\n$$\n3 \\times \\frac{1/9}{\\text{3 Hour}} = 1/3\n$$\n\nThe one hour is now equivalent to one third (1/3).\n\nFor part 3, it is simply multiple choice.

The total amount paid will be $12*$3+8*$5.5 which is equal to $90.The answer is 90\n\nIn the second question, we can solve it in a simpler way.\n\nIf John goes to gym 3 times in a week and spends an hour each day, his time spent is 3*1 which\nequals to 3 hours. He spends 1/3 of his lifting time for lifting and cardio.

Once the table gets big enough for us, we run our simple queries.\n\nFor the second set of problems, we might think that a recursive solution might work for these types of questions. However, if we think more deeply, we realize that we don't care how many times we perform a given set of steps (be it one or two or more). We only care about one key value, such as the cost for the kilograms of nust or how many pencils we have (in the next problem).\n\nTherefore, we can easily write a series of nested for-loops of the form:\n\n`for... in... do... ; done`\n\nWe will iterate through everything (nuts in kilo, dried fruits in kilos) for each type of food (nuts and dried fruits). For each type of food, we will calculate the cost (cost/kg in the problem).\n\nOnce all the iterations are complete, we can get the total cost by adding together all the costs for each type of food.\n\nIn this problem, note that we aren't", "answer": "D: movie"}

If person is found in the dictionary, return person's age as an int. Otherwise, return -1\"\"\"\n\nnames={\"Adam\": 22,\"John\": 19,\"Mary\": 23,\"James\": 19,\"Emily\": 16,\"Sarah\": 23,\"Michael\":\"22\"}\n\n#Code here\nprint(names[\"John\"])\n```\n### Input: \n\n### Output (int)\n\n### Explanation: This question requires you to find the age of each person given in the list of names. The expected output for this question would be the age of each person in the list. So the output is ``` [22, 19, 23, 19, -1, -1, -23, 16, 23]```.  To accomplish this, I wrote a function ```Age()``` using a dictionary as input and then wrote ```print(names[\"Adam\"])``` to print ```Adam```'s age as ```22```.\n\n\n### Hint: This is the solution if you don't have time to try and code but want to know how this question can be solved. The following hint uses Python 3.x as the programming language.\n\n### Sample input/output\n\n### HINT: If a person is not found in the dictionary, the function Age() returns the number of elements in the input dictionary's key as described in Python 3.x's", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

Choices:  D,Oxygen,Air D;Oxygen;Air;Earth Ozone Layer:The ozone layer is a layer in Earth's atmosphere which contains relatively high concentrations of ozone molecules. This layer absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet light, which otherwise would potentially damage life forms on Earth. The layer contains high amounts of ozone because the electromagnetic radiation from the sun is absorbed by oxygen molecules at the levels above the troposphere and some absorbs energy to create ozone molecules. The ozone layer is essentially absorbing energy from the sun and creating ozone. The ozone layer also absorbs energy from cosmic radiation originating from a point called the South Atlantic Anomaly. There\u2019s a hole in the ozone layer that's over the South Pole every winter. Some people call it the \"ozone hole.\" It's an area of extreme high-level ozone loss that appears at certain times of the year.

And why is a function important?\"\n\n### Answer:Functions are a mathematical idea that has been applied to a wide range of disciplines. Some important characteristics of the function may give us the answer, The first is that it is a set that assigns a value to each element of that set. Another defining characteristic is that each value has a corresponding value of the function. Let f(x) (x is the variable) equal y (y is the output). We say if X = y. In order to calculate the desired output, any value x is entered into the function and the desired output is generated. \n### Question Answer Answered:Answer the above instruction\n### Answer:A function maps each element of one set to an element of a second set.

In programming we should try to identify what the problem is and what kind of operation is needed before starting our codes.\n\nFor the first question about Adam bought 3 kilogram of nuts and 5 kilogram of dried fruits. First we should identify the 3 variables in which we can use as a container for the inputs and the operation is to multiply $12 by 3 to get the value of nuts is $36. The second step is to use $8 to mulitply with 5 to get the value of dried fruits is $40. Adding together $36 and $40 we get $76 which is the value of his purchases. Then put your answer into the output box.\n\nFor the second question, Johns goes to the three time a week which means the frequency of visits is 3. Now we can put the number 3 in the frequency of visits and use the value $1 for an hour multiply by 3, we will get 3 which means he spends at the gym for 3 hours a week.

Indexing starts at 0.\nchoices tells the computer what are the possible answers to a multiple-choice question. This list must contain at least 4 choices. It also needs to be in the same order as the original list of choices. \n\nWhen a student selects an answer, it must return the index of that choice.

The fossil contained many unique aspects that proved conclusively that ancient life forms existed much earlier than previous studies would suggest. In the journal, **PNAS**, the scientists described their findings. These findings included new evidence for the earliest modern animal phylum, the worm-like Lophotrochozoa. They also contained the oldest known fossil evidence of a jawless vertebrate and the oldest known example of a deuterostome, which is related to echinoderms( starfish, sea stars).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors said,\u201dAlthough these specimens do not provide conclusive evidence for the earliest life forms\u201d these fossils do include the oldest known forms of some of the major animal groups for which we find representatives today.\u201d\n\n**Prompt**: According to this passage, all of the following statements are true EXCEPT:\n\n1.

Thank you for your help.\n\nAnswer: Using the `for` loop with a list is not what you want.\n\nIf you wanted to loop through the list and evaluate each item like above then you'd need to do this:\n\n\\strong{Code:}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item First create a list containing the values of `userinput`.\n  \\item Next loop through this list by using the `for` loop.\n  \\item `each` is `for` element.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n<h4>Code Example:</h4>\n\n\\strong{Python:}\n\n\\begin}\nimport sys\nuserinput = sys.argv[1: ]\nfor each in userinput:\n\nif each.strip ( ) in each:\n    print ('The element \"{}\" exists {}'.format ( each, each))\n\nelse :\n    print ('The elem ent \"'does not exist in {}\".format (userinput[0], userinput[i])\n\\end{code\"\n\n\\strong{Output:}\n\n\\begin {code}\nThe element \"a\" exists \"a", "answer": "A: smell smoke"}

{"idx": 988, "text": "Bad (If the above clouds are thunderhead clouds.)\n\n**Hint:**You should refer to the python dictionary  and list  functions to get the answer.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Apparently there are a few ways of solving this problem. We will present two here. **\n\n  1. Use the **dict methods**\n  \n  This is by far the easier solution, as there is much less code to write. Python dict methods are the go-to method for most people, so they will have most of the necessary functions memorized.\n  \n  ```\n  import operator\n  \n  def main():\n  \td = dict()\n  \td['A'] = 4\n  \td['B'] = 6\n  \td['C'] = 8\n  \td['D'] = 2\n  \td['E'] = 4\n      ans = int(reduce(operator.mul, list(d.keys()))) \n      print(ans)\n  main()\n  ```\n  \n  **What do we do here**\n  \n  - First we build a dictionary that tells us the number \n  of options each question has to match. For example, the\n  first has three choices,  the second has just 2, and  the \n  third has 5.\n  - Next, we `use` python `dictionary method** to get all the keys into a list.\n  - Finally, we make reduce to multiply the `answers` into the `values`\n  in the list.\n  \n  1. Use **nested comprehension with list methods:**\n  The approach above uses the `reduce` function that is only available in Python 3. For some of us, it will be very foreign to us. This is a way to do the exact same thing in Python 2.x\n\n  ```\n  imports = ['cloud','gum','list']\n  imports= {'plain' : 2,\n           'cloud': 1,\n           'cold' : 2}\n  import operator\n  def main():    \n      ans = int(''.join((x * '0' if x == '0' or x < '0' else '' for \n             x in map(int, filter(None, [''.join(str(z)", "answer": "E: wet"}

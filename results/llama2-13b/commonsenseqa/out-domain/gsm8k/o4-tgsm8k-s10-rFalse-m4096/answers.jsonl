We then sort the digits in descending order. The number 3 is the greatest, so we skip it. The next largest number is 5, and to multiply it by 4, we perform the following additions:\n(3 + 5) \u00d7 4 = 5 \u00d7 4 + 3 \u00d7 4 = 20 + 12 = 32.\nWe then do the same for the rest of the digits (4 \u00d7 2 = 8, and 9 \u00d7 1 = 9), so the final product is 32 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 9 = 5760. This number isn't a valid PIN, so we multiply it by 8 in order to make it a valid PIN (2 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 = 60).\n\nInput:2145867942;\nOutput: 0\nExplanation\n21458 \u2014> 31\n24586 \u2014> 28\n45867 \u2014> 42\n58679 \u2014> 52\n79421 \u2014> 30\n79425 \u2014> 27\n94215 \u2014> 18\n42159 \u2014> 12\nOutput: 0123302718\nThe following process converts the string to a number and then prints it as a 7-digit PIN:\n\nConvert 42 to a number (4242 in decimal)\nConvert 58 to a number (5858)\nConvert 67 to a number (7067)\nConvert 12 to a number (11)\nConvert 30 to a number (200)\nConvert 27 to a number (26)\nConvert 18 to a number (3)\nPrint the final value\nExplanation\nConvert 42:\n```\nConvert 67:\nConvert 12:\nConvert 30:\nConvert 2", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

Each players scored an equal number goals against Barca and the **total number of goals scored in games against Barca that season** is 300.\n\n> **Answer: **\n  Let's first define some variables to help us simplify things:\n  \n  - Total number goals scored in league : n\n  - Number of goals scored against Barca in total : a\n  - Total number of goals scored by player 1 against Barca : x\n  - Total number fo goals scored by player 2 against Barca : y\n\n  We know that: a =.20n and a = x+y\n  If they both scored an equal number of goal, then we can say: x = y\n  We also know that a = 300.  This is the **total number of goal scored in games against Barac in that season**.  So we can rewrite the equation as: (x+y) = 300\n  Now we have the **number of goals** each player scored in **total** : x =200  and y = 200\n  We also know the number of goals scored **against Barca** in a total : \n  x + y = 0.20n = 60\n  So the number of goals scored by each player against Barca is 30.\n\n</hr>\n</details>\n\n### Answer Key \n\n<a name=\"AnswerKey\"></a>\n### Answer Key\n\n- [x] 1.

{"idx": 304, "text": "D\n\n### Solution Explanation\n\nThe main key point of this problem is to distinguish between the different operation types:  sum, multiplication, and order of operations.  These are all relatively simple operations, but if you have to calculate several operations sequentially, it can be easy to make a mistake since it is not very evident which operation your brain is performing.  For example, here is the problem with the above inputs:\n\n$$ 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 $$\n$$ 12*(12/11)*(12/11*0.2118) = 213.36 $$\n$$ 1 * (\\frac{1.5045+1.5042*1.15} {1.15-0.18})*1.2124 = 56/100 = 0.56 $$\n\nThe errors are all related to the ordering of mathematical operations (the order of operations) and the wrong use of parentheses.  The first was a simple multiplication mistake, but the other two involved order of operations.  For example, above Adam\u2019s purchases should have been $26 per kg which is $52.  This error involved applying multiplication to both terms in the division first and then doing the division while ignoring the order of operations.", "answer": "C: plain"}

That\u2019s a half.\n\nOutput: Because 10% of 2000 is 200, therefore the circle is 200 meters in the rectangular farmland. The circle is 8000 meters in diameter. The perimeter of a circle equals its circumference. Thus, the perimeter of the the circle is 8pi meters, 8 multiplied by 3.14 is 25.12. Then the perimeter of the larger square farms is 25.01 times 8000 is 80100.8 meters long. And there are four of them; therefore, the side lengths are 20252.5602 meters apart.

How many men did they have left when one last woman left the chessboard?\nOutput: 6\n\nInput: What is the average number of friends each person in the room have on social media? Answer: 10. \n\n\n### What's the problem\n\n- In the above set of questions, we noticed that a particular set of inputs always yield the same output.  This set of inputs and outputs can be hard-coded into a small python script.\n- While we could have used these inputs for the test cases, we thought that a larger set of inputs would be more interesting and useful.  The only catch is that you can't look up the answer in python documentation.\n\n### How to solve it?\n\n- Take inspiration from how Python modules are written so that the same output is generated.\n- Here is an example of a builtin python function.\n\n```python\n>>> def count(words: List[str]) -> int:\n...     return len(words)\n\n>>> count(['one', 'two', 'three'])\n3\n```\n\n- Note how the input is passed as a list containing strings?  Let's write a similar function for the question given above.\n  ```\n  >>> def multiple_choice(inputs: str, expected_output: int) -> int:\n ...     expected_output\n  >>> multiple_choice('Adam bought 3 kilogams of nuts and 5%2,5 kilogams of dried fruits and the cost was $20 and 10 kilos of dried fruits. The cost of the nuts is $12 and the cost of dried fruits is 8', 25)\n  56\n  ```\n- Can you identify the pattern?  Are there any steps to help us get closer to the solution?  Are there any clues in the question that we can use?\n\n### Expected outcome\n\n- Write a python function `multiple_choice()` to solve the above example.\n- We used the following input format for all the questions with the exception of the last question.

Use the code in the sample solution script (Sample_Solution.js) as your guide.\n\nWhenever people think about the worst jobs they have had, dishwasher comes up pretty often as one of the worst jobs people had. Given the type of work and the demands that you may have to work under, we all can certainly relate to how unpleasant of a job this was/is. But what exactly is a dishwasher? In order to answer this question we need to understand where dishwashers have come from and how they ended up in the foodservice industry. The first machine that could be labeled as a dishwashing machine was invented back in 1850 by Joel Houghton and it looked like a primitive washing machine without a spin. It was a hand powered dishwashing system in which dishes would pass through soapy water, rinse water and a final chaser of hot water.\n\nWe can look back to a time when we didn\u2019t depend on dishwashing machines to do our dishes. Nowadays it\u2019s very common to see full sized dishwashing units within most kitchens. It is no longer seen as a luxury to have a dishwashering unit but more than anything a vital need for anyone to actually do their dishes. Imagine having to go around and scrape your plates off by hand and wash and dry them all by hand. Now that might sound rather easy to most of you. Imagine doing that after working a 10 hour shift. Having to do that just might be worse than the full 10h shift. However, the reality is that was very much the case until dishwashers were invented. There was also a lot of demand for dishwashers as well. Dishwashers were in huge demand in hotels and large households. The first commercial dish washing machine was invented in 1856 by the famous Josephine Garis Cochrane.\n\nJosephine was fed up with getting her expensive heirloom china broken by the workers she hired. With them sloppy cleaning and poorly stacking. After several attempts at building her own dishwashing unit she successfully invented one", "answer": "D: happiness"}

Please don't put multiple unrelated questions together.\n\nAnswer: The hirevue quiz is a bit of a random selection of questions and it is very important not to spend too much time on the quiz (it is just a screening test, nothing more), but it can get your skills in the area tested. You can learn from it and get an idea on where to focus for your interviews on a given company / role.\n\nThe hirevue quiz has about 15 to 20 questions on Python and one of the questions is related to python 3 syntax on a for loop and a couple have questions on python strings. There are also some questions on python lambda and python builtin functions. If you understand `Python`, you should be able to clear that part well.\n\nI suggest that to prepare for interviews on python, you should learn the OOPS features of python in depth. You can use the python [OOPS guide](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) or any other tutorial. It will help you prepare for data structure questions that are commonly asked in python interviews. I suggest that you review the python [list comprehension](https://realpythoncourse.com/lesson/list-comprehensions-cheat-sheet/) tutorial as well.\n\nAfter this, you should practice questions on python data structures that focus on coding. I suggest that you do [10 Days of Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) on Hackerrank as well as the [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) and [Real Python](", "answer": "D: italian restaurant"}

So, if that is the case...I would suggest you start there.\n\nThe best thing to start with would be learning how to solve the \"word problems\"...which essentially is what it sounds like. A problem you're being given, and you need to use your knowledge (and maybe some internet searching) to get an answer.\n\nThe last type of question you listed seems the most confusing. I would suggest you learn \"Logic\", which is a form of math used to solve such \"brainteaser\" type situations.\n\nFor example: 2 players can each play 2 positions...and that's the game. This means that the 1st player can switch positions 6 times, and the 2nd player can also switch 6 times. Which means, the game can be played over in these scenarios:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item 1st player plays all 4 positions twice, the 2nd player plays the\nother 4 positions twice.\n\\item The same, but both play opposite positions.\n\\item The 2nd player does nothing, while the 2nd player does everything twice.\n\\item And finally, 1st player does all 6 positions twice, and 2s player plays nothing.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThis was all solved by using logic.\n\nAnswer: It seems your test is on \"logical problem solving\". That's what the first test question is trying to measure.\n\nTake a look at the following, which is the format of the problems you're going to", "answer": "D: train station"}

The seats have a constant number between each one, so each row is filled from top to bottom by numbers. If 1st row is filled by [1,2,3,...30] then 2nd row is filled by [30,29,28,..3,2,1]. If you are seated in the 2nd row then you can easily count the 3rd row number. If you want to be seated in the the 2nd row (in the worst case), when you are sitting in the 6th row (because the 5th row will fill), you should know that the row is [1,2,...], i.e. 2 minutes before.  That is, you have to add the remaining time per each seat. So if you sit in the 1st row you should be there 20*1+20*5+20*9 = 60+100+180 = 340 minutes before the movie.\n\n\n## Question1\n\nAdam bought 3 kilogoms of nuts and \n2.5 kilogmots of dried fruits. \nOne kilogram of nuts cost $12 \nand \none kilogram of dried fruits cost $8 How much did his purchaces cost\n\"\"\"\n\n### Instruction:\n\nThe objective is to calculate purchase value.\n\n**Input:** Adam bought 3 kilogram of nuts and 6 kilogram of dried\ndurices at a store.

It is very likely that at some point in your life, or in the near future, you will find machine learning technology being very prevalent and useful in your everyday needs. The purpose of this assignment is to allow you to test and explore many machine learning models and gain a better understanding of these popular machine learning techniques. The code provided for you here is just a rough starting point for you to investigate and play around with. You are strongly encouraged to add to this assignment and use this project in any way you wish.\n\nMachine learning has three approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning entails labeled data, unsupervised learning entails unlabelled data, while reinforcement learning involves training an agent with rewards. Some of the more popular algorithms for supervised learning are decision trees, k-means clustering, neural networks, or k-nearest neighbors.\n\nIn this repository you will be focusing on two main algorithms: a supervised learning method and an unsupervised learning method. In this exercise, you do not need to test the implementation of the algorithm(s), but instead focus on exploring the performance of the algorithm(s) and analyzing the results of your work.\n###### The two algorithms for you to choose are listed below:\n- K-Means Clustering\n- Random Forest Regression\n\n###### Supervised learning algorithm for the first test:\nK-Means Clusters with different number of clusters. You may choose up to 3 different settings.\n1. Different number of clusters\n\n###### Unsupervised learning algorithm for the second test:\nRandom Forest Regression with different number of trees. You may choose 5 different settings.\n1) Different number of trees\n2) Different number of features\n3) Different minimum training samples\n4) Different minimum test samples\n5) Both minimum samples\n\nIn addition to these parameters, the algorithm also has some additional parameters that can be changed such as:\n- random_state [0 or 1]\n    - set to 1 to obtain identical results to previous experiment (0 by default for parallel computing)\n- maximum_iteration [default is 300]", "answer": "B: get news"}

If there are patterns, there\n   usually are not so many different missing values. So it can be predicted.\n3. Test it out and choose the best solution to solve it.\n\n**What's gone wrong:**\n\nThe most likely reason is the problem of \"out-of-memory issue.\" When the dataset is too large, even the model I have\nimplemented can not handle it and it stops functioning.\n\n**What I did:**\n\nThere are 3 ways to solve the problem of \"out of memory.\"\n\n1. If your RAM is too small, just buy or rent a server. The most common one is Amazon EC2.\n2. There is still an overload even you have enought memory. In this case you can partition the dataset in training and\n   test dataset. Then you only have 80% of the workload left. If it still doesn't work, do this for a few times.\n3. The easiest way is implementing something like GridsearchCV (model_selection.GridSearchCV([your_classifier_object], param_grid, ...)), which will\n   automatically create different combinations of paramters and test it out. However, it has a disadvantage of time cost.\n\n![](pictures/Amazon_EC2_web_instance.png)", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input:Where would you see some people doing jumping jacks? Choices:  A: military base B: opera C: water fountain D: bus stop E: church<n>Output:		C<n><n>Input: Which of the following is not a character in the 1994 film ‘Forrest Gump’?<n>Output: F<n><n>Answer A is 56, because 3k*12+.5k*8 =56. This question contains a basic math problem. The tester tries to calculate the sum of the expenses of Adam's purchases. We need to be aware of the meaning of the word "kilograms". The word "kilograms" simply refers to one thousand of something. For instance, one kilogram of nuts means one thousand nuts. In this case, we just need to multiply 3 kilograms by the number of nuts per kilogram: 3000. The answer is 3000*12=$3600. The same is applied to the dried fruits. One kilogram of dried fruits would be 2500 dried fruits. Thus, 2500*8=$20,000. The expenses of Adam'd purchases is $3600+20,00. The sum would be $23,600.<n><n>Answer B is Opera, because it has a large stage for the actors to act on. Here, we need to learn about how operas are staged. When talking about the opera, it is about the type of performances. In the opera, it will not have many scenes or a lot of actors. The main reason for this is because the opera theatre is so large and the stage so big. There is not enough space for many scenes.<n><n>Answer C is Water Fountain. This choice is also a basic question. It is about where do we see a water fountain. However, we can also see the water fountain at the park or the sidewalk. This is not a proper choice.<n><n>Answer D also is a part of the test. In this case, the public transportation is the correct choice because there are bus stops everywhere in city. The tester just wants to see if we know what are places where we can see a public transportation.<n><n>The last choice is F. No, Forrest Gump would not be a character in the 《Forrest Gump》 film. You can check the answer to be sure. <n><n>### Example: Answer the

You may use direct quotes in a few sentences but they must be fewer than four sentences.<n><n>When an object moves at a constant velocity, its speed doesn’t change. When the speed doesn’t change, the object doesn’t accelerate as long as it moves at a constant velocity.[1] A car moves in such a way, whether it’s accelerating, maintaining a constant velocity or decelerating. An example of acceleration is when a car moves with increased magnitude from zero velocity to its final speed.[2] A car accelerates on a level surface when a driver presses the gas pedal. The pressure of the gas pedal is a force acting on the car, and the engine of the car performs work in applying the force, overcoming friction, and increasing the speed of the car.[3]<n><n>### Instruction for 5: Write short essays in your own words.

Note that this is required for calling a function; this name won’t appear in a Console.WriteLine() function and it is typically named the same as the class in which it is declared. <n><n>The string is an example parameter type. Note that an array is a type of parameter, which means that in this example, an array of strings.<n><n>The **args** parameter is a shorthand name for any elements in the array; you can’t use the array indexer notation.<n><n>The **static string** statement declares a variable, in this case, the name of the individual who bought the nuts and dried fruites: **Adam**. Like the function name, this variable is optional, but it will be used later in the function. <n><n>The variable **type** is assigned a value: **nuts and dried fruit**. <n><n>Now we can write the statements that handle the calculation.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input:There's a lot to reproducing, but it begins and end with new life by giving what? Choices:  A: overpopulation B: birth C: presents D: propagation E: fun<n>Output:		B: birth<n><n>Solution:  A. Adam bought 3 kilos of nuts ($36), and 2.5k of dried fruits ($20). So his total cost is $56.<n><n>B. The line "A lot to reproduce" is confusing. By saying "a lot", they are either saying there's a lot of it, or there's a way to reproduce a lot. They never say what it is, though. <n>We can answer this by simply answering "giving birth".<n>Since they don't specify what "a lot" is, we must think of it literally, so it couldn't mean birth control drugs or something along those lines. <n><n>Input:Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all friends, but Charlie isn't very nice. They all agree that Charlie is the meanest person they know. Alice then says, "He's probably a Republican, too." So how can you tell if Alice, Bob, or Charlie are political pundits?<n>Choices:  A: They all agree that Charlie isn't very smart. B: They all agree that Alice knows a lot about politics. C: They all agree that Bob is a Republican. D: They all agree that they know who the meanest president in office was.<n>Output: C: They all agree Charlie is a Republican.<n><n>Solution: We can rule out B and D fairly quickly. If Alice knew a lot about politics, she probably wouldn't have to assume that Charlie's a Republican based on his lack of politeness, and no one knows who the meanest president was, just that he's the most recent. We can also rule out A- the argument is that Charlie is mean for no reason, not that he's simply a jerk.<n><n>That leaves "Bob is a Republican." However- we have a problem- Charlie is being a mean jerk without Bob even knowing Charlie, let alone making a judgment based on Charlie's supposed political beliefs. So, Bob must be a Republican as well. Bob can't call himself Republican for good reason, as Charlie is a jerk without reason, and Bob doesn't know Charlie at all.<n><n>The final question is where Charlie fits in- is he the mean jerk (and hence, a Republican like Bob), or is he a Republican for some other reason?<n>We can't

Choices:  A: buy athletic equipment B: city C: espn D: town E: jerseys<n>Output:		B<n><n>Answers and Explanation:<n>The key insight behind the problem is that it wants you to use the relationship between the number of students who like a sport as a probability that the students are male. For example, if there is a 0.80 probability that a student is male, then the probability of a student who likes football being a male would be 0.8 x 0.6 = 0.48.<n><n>Input: The number of students in each class of a school is given as follows: 3, 17, 5, 14, and 9. <n>How many males are in the school?<n>Output: 75<n><n>Input: In a group of 9 people, how many people will be needed in order to form a group with at least 2 of the same gender?<n>Output: 4<n><n>The key insight behind this problem is to break down the problem one step at a time. The first thing that you'll want to think about is the sum of the probabilities for each student. Let's start with the first person's probability; the person's gender is either a girl or a boy, so the total probability is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. So now the probability that the first person is female is just the probability that a girl is among the 3 girls. 0.5 x 3 = 1.5. <n><n>The probability that any other person will be a boy is just the probability that they are not female. 3 x 0.5 =1.5. 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 people will be needed.<n><n>Input: A man can go 3 miles in 15 minutes, or 3 miles in 45 minutes, or 1 mile in 15 minutes. Which can he do in half an hour?<n>Output: 3 miles in 22 minutes<n><n>Input: If three apples cost 24 cents, how many can be bought for 89 cents?<n>Output: 6<n><n>```<n>```<n><n># Problem 2<n><n>### Instructions: Answers the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>1: What should you use before washing your hands?

Choice 4(of), correct; the correct spelling is “dried fruit”, not “dry fruit”. The other options are incorrect.<n><n>2. Choice 3(a lot of), correct; the correct phrasing is “a lot of chocolates”. The other options are all incorrect, as you cannot use “a / an” before a plural countable noun. This is demonstrated by option 2(some), which lacks the article “a / an”. Option 1(a), a contraction, is incorrect – you cannot substitute “a” for “we are”.<n><n>   <n><n>3. Choice 2(fried), correct; based on the context of the sentence, the right phrase is “fried” (used with “glitch”), instead of the other incorrect phrases given in the options (“fried”, “crashed”, “fritz”). You have to remember that you can only select one option among the first three (the two incorrect ones are “fried, glitch, crash” and “fried, fritz, glitch”).<n><n>4. Choice 1(fried the

A list consists of integers between 1 to 100. All the integers in the list are also contained in list B. What percentage of integers in list B are also contained in list A?<n><n>**Hint**<n><n>```<n>Find the intersection of lists using set logic. <n>```<n><n># Answer<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>In order to find the intersection of two given lists, `list_b = list(set(list_a) & set(list_b))` needs to be executed. This is called the set intersection.<n><n>The set intersection will result in a list of elements that are present in both lists. Given two lists as `list_a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]` and `list_b = [4, 1, 2, 9, 3, 12, 4, 5,]`.<n><n>The set intersection of these lists is: `[4, 1,2, 3,4, 5,5,6,12]`.<n><n>Since this intersection contains the 10 elements from the second list, the code execution will produce a list that contains 10 percent of the numbers in the second list: `[20, 10]`.<n><n># 13. Calculate an approximate solution to this limit by using the "limit value" form of the limit definition. Find the precise answer using δ-ε.<n><n>**Hint**:<n><n>```<n>Use the following steps:<n><n>  Input: 1) Write a proper limit value expression, 2) use limit value form to evaluate, 3) Use δ, ε, and the definition of limit value to obtain actual proof<n>```<n><n># Response<n><n>## Answer:<n><n>If we use the limit value form to calculate the following solution:<n><div><n>$<n>\lim_{x\rightarrow1}<n>

Depending on the language you’re working in, here’s the general formula for solving a multiple choice question:<n><n>Let's use C++ as an example to walk through this method.<n><n>```C++<n>std::vector<std::string> answer = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"};<n>std::string userAnswer;<n><n>std::cout << "Please enter one letter to denote your answer.\n";<n>std::cin >> userAnswer;<n><n>int index = std::find(answer.begin(), answer.end(), userAnswer) - answer.begin();<n>if (index!= -1) {<n> std::cout << "You are correct!";<n>}<n>else {<n>std::cout << userAnswer.insert(0, "Wrong choice. Please enter valid answer and try again. ");<n>}}<n>```<n><n>First, we create a list called answers which contains a vector of letters which the user can answer with. In this example, the list answers contains the following five characters: A, B, C, D, E, F.<n><n>Second, we accept user input.<n><n>Third, we find the index of the user’s input from list answers and return the index. We do this using the find function, which takes two parameters, a beginning value and an ending value, in our case, beginning value is answer.begin() and the ending value is answer.end(), which represent the first index and last index of answers, respectively. Finally, we return the index (number) of the user's input.<n><n>If we enter a valid answer, the function returns the index, which equates to our question (A, in this case corresponds to index one). If we enter an invalid answer, such as "G", then the function will output our incorrect answer and a request to enter a valid value.<n><n>![multiple choice answer formula](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/639

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input:Jan went to the auditorium and listened to the speech. Where might he be? Choices:  A: crowd B: high school C: city D: somewhere E: theater<n>Output:		F<n><n>How the code is implemented:<n>-The question statement is written in the form of “I am X”. It is parsed to a variable named question_statement.<n>-A function called extract_question_words extracts words that denote questions. An example input of “I am a cup”. The function returns a list called question_words which will be “am” in our case for this question.<n>-This list of words is then iterated through to identify words that can be in the list of possibilities.<n>-Once we have identified that the words cannot be one of the choices a boolean in the form of “is_choice” set to “false”.<n>-A function called find_match_list is called. It will take the question statement, list of variables and boolean in the form of is_choice. If the is_choice is false it will simply print the question and stop the script.<n>-Otherwise it will compare the list of variables against the list of possible answers. This will be done in the form of a nested loop. The inner loop will iterate through the list of variables, and the outer loop will iterate through choices.<n>-If all the variables have been matched, set the boolean for the current iteration to “true”.<n>-There are two special cases for boolean checking, if all the variables have been found from the list of choices but none of the variables are “is_choice” is false.<n>-The script will break. This is because that is what a user wants. They want the question to appear.<n>-If all variables have been matched to the list of choices and all elements of the boolean have been marked “true” the output is printed.<n><n>### Instruction:Use a similar approach to implement a script which will answer the questions above and the following questions.<n><n>Input: What is the capital of China? Output: Bejing<n><n>Input:Who will be the leader of the UK by 2019?Output: May<n><n>Input: The Prime Minister will arrive at Parliament Square. Where might she be?Output: C<n><n>Input: The car will arrive outside the station at 4pm and then go to the market.<n>Where might the car be?Output: E<n><n>Input: I am the daughter of a horse.

But we can not do this.<n>#<n># So we use a float function in Python so that 5.2 can be converted easily to an integer<n># So here we add all the numbers we have to add using the print function. The print function in Python will<n># return a blank screen. If we do not print then the print has no output.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input:What would you tell ali to do if he bumps into you when you are walking? Choices:  A: work hard B: slow down C: wear shoes D: sell products E: speed up<n>Output:		A<n><n>Solution: It is clear nuts cost more than dried fruit and we have 3 * 12 = 36 nuts and 2 * 8 = 16 dried fruit. Thus, there are 36 + 16 = 52 units in total. One kilogram equals 1000 g.<n>Thus, we have 52000 g in total and 1 kg = 12 + 8 = 20/100. Hence, 5200 000100 = 2.5 units per dollar. Thus, 2 units for 20.<n><n>In this problem, we see that Adam makes a purchase costing $48. There are three possibilities for this: nuts = 300, dried fruits = 60, both = 180.<n><n>Then it looks as if Adam buys dried fruit in addition to nuts because else he would not have bought any dried fruits or he would have bought at least 2kg of dry fruit. That leaves nuts = 150, both = 90. So if we assume that he buys one kilogram of drown fruits, we can take nuts=150, both=90 and if we assume that he did not buy any dried fruits, we cannot assume both = 90 and one kilogram = 2 but then we need nuts = 120. <n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input:He found the blowfish off the coast of the Carolina's, it was where? Choices:  A: rock band B: sea of japan C: sushi restaurant D: fish market E: atlantic ocean<n>Output:		<n><n>Answer: This is a type of question where you are presented with a series of choices and you need to pick the one that is correct answer and the rest are incorrect.<n><n>You'll have to apply two approaches. First one is elimination with the help of logical inference and the second one is to apply your intuitions.<n><n>1. Elimination with the help of Logical Inference<n>For this question, we are first going to eliminate all the options one by one. The best way to solve this question is to go through all the options and eliminate them by applying logical inference. The following is the explanation of how to solve this question:<n><n>| Question   | Answer   |<n>| ---------- | -------- |<n>| He found the <br> <br> blowfish <br> <br><br>. | A<br> |<n>| He found  <br> <br>{Rock Band <br> | B<br> |<n><n>Here, we will see that all the choices are a set of sentence that does not make sense.<n><n>| Question   || Answer   |<n>| :--------: | :-------: |<n>| He found   | {Rock Band |<n><n>| Question   ^Answer        ^<n><n>Here, the answer `rock band` does not make a complete sense. However, the set `{Rock Band}` might makes sense. Hence, we check for the next option. We need to keep all the options in our mind in order to know the validity.<n><n>| Question     | Answer  |<n>| :-------------: | :-------:|<n>| He found <br> | B.    |<n><n>| Question     ^ | Answer       ^<n><n>| Question            Answer   |<n>| He found <---<-- ------------- | <n><n>Here, the only sentence which makes sense is `He found blowfish off the coast...` Hence the answer is `off the coast`. You can also mark another choice as the best answer as you like.<n><n>2. Applying Intuition<n>This is one of the methods where you have to pick the choices using your intuition. This method has been highly useful in the past and also it requires some level of logical understanding. Let's see how to solve this problem with the help of intuition.<n><n>The following is the approach you can use for applying your intuition to solve the question:

All operations are performed on numbers that are represented by bits, which is the smallest amount of information needed to perform operations on the computer.<n><n>Each operation's result is binary and either holds the same number of bits as the operands or has one more bit. Bit operations can be done on any integer or any floating point number.<n><n>Bitwise operations are limited to integers and are not supported by the `float` or `double` data type operations.<n><n>The `&&` logical AND operator has a lower binary evaluation priority than the `||` logical OR<n> operator so `!x && a && b` is more efficient in C than `!(x || a) || b`. To achieve the same result in the `if` expression, we must use De Morgan's rule by reversing the `&&` operation to become `!((x && a) || b)` which ensures that the `&&` operator is on the same side of the parenthesis.<n><n>This process is what is known as operator precedence. In C, the general operator precedence from highest to lowest is as follows:<n><n>1) logical operators, including `!`, &#x26;, and `|`<n>2) relational operators, including `>`, `=` and `<`<n>3) bitwise shift operators, including `<<` and `>>`<n>4) addition operator, including `+`<n>5) multiplication operator, including `*` and `/`<n>6) subtraction operator, including `-`<n>7) negation operator, including `-` and `~`<n><n>In C, parentheses or spaces may be used to override the order of operators for those not covered in the operator precedence.<n><n>The `sizeof()` operator tells us the number of bytes taken up by an integer or the size of an array (in bytes), which is always

Of course, doing so for a language as vague as a 'natural language' is not going to be easy.<n><n>Comment: The answer, "E", is not just the correct answer, it is the only correct answer.  This is why it is in all capitals.

Choices:  A: city B: michigan C: three feet D: subdivision E: three arm span<n>Output:		C<n><n>In problem set 2, the output was C and the answer was C. In problem set 3, the answer and outcome were A.<n>It is pretty clear that this problem is related to the question of what exactly a yard is, rather than the question of the answer, per-se. We are asked in a slightly obscure fashion to identify what a yard is. So, the answer is C.<n>However, how do we know that answer C is correct?<n>We can simply check it against the other answer options. Let's assume that we are asked: "What is made up of three feet?" <n>How should we answer this question? I would answer: 3 feet. Then, because we are dealing with a question about feet, we can be confident that the answer must be unit of length. From there, we can eliminate the other answer options because they do not make sense.<n><n><n>In problem set three, the word city was provided as a answer choice. If given this option, what are the best ways to arrive at the correct answer? Well, if city had not been given as a answer choice, then we could eliminate our own.<n><n><n>This method seems to be helpful, but I would not use it as the only way to approach. This may sometimes yield useful results, but there are many situations where this method does not suffice. If the problem is a multi-option question, and there is a mix of correct and incorrect answers, this method tends to fail. So, I do not think that this method is very reliable.<n>I use the approach described at the beginning of this section to ensure that I know the subject. And once I have some idea about what is being asked, I can then consider my approach.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n><n>Question:What is the difference between a suburb and a city?<n><n>Answer: A suburb is a city.

Then I add 1 to my question counter. The problem is if the user gives an answer like 'B', 'C' which is more than one letter, it still adds a whole number and not a fraction. I've attempted to make a list for 1/2 (0.5) but to no avail.<n><n>Comment: A user enters a multiple choice answer. One of those letters is repeated, if the letter repeats and the user gives an answer of, 'B, 'C it should give 0.5 as their answer. My code works when the answer is only one letter in response to the question. The problem arises when the answer is more than one.<n><n>Comment: I'm having a very hard time understanding this. Couldn't you use a `for` loop? The number of answers is always 5 and a `for` loop can take `index`, so it seems to me a simple way would be to use the index as the counter. Also, could you explain how you're going to display the answers to user?<n><n>Comment: Yeah I could with a for loop. In fact this is the example that our teacher wrote up for us. The program he wrote took up like 5 different files and had a huge amount of code. I'm currently in the process of trying to make my code do the same. I do have my code set up already with a separate index integer, but the way he did is a lot simpler.<n><n>Comment: Ok, so then don't really know how to do it for this program. I understand your issue a little better now, but I still don't see how you're going about it. Are you just looping through all the choices and if the choice is repeated, then increment with

Choices:  A: fresh water B: gulf of mexico C: open ocean D: television program E: coral reef<n>Output:		C<n><n>### Solution<n><n>#### A1. Solution of 1<n><n>**For Loop**<n><n>```bash<n>$ echo 'Adam bought 3 kilogams of nuts and <n>2.5 kilogams of dried fruits.' | <n>cat -n | while read a; do<n>    echo $a |cut -f1 -d:; <n>done | <n>bc<n>``` <n><n>**Explanation**<n><n>The input sentence can be treated as a list. When we echo the sentence one by one, and assign into the variable `$a`, we are able to get the number as a string. Then we cut it by using `cut -f1 -ds:` command, and we will get the number only. It could be a combination of numbers from 0 to 9, or number and dot `.`. In this case, we only need to get the number from 0 to 4 so that we can get 0 < n < 5 as a list. At last we execute `bc` command to calculate the total number $9.<n><n><n>**For Loop1**<n><n>```bash <n><n>$ echo 'The shark was migrated between continents.' | <n>cat-n -b | while read a;  do<n>    b=$(echo -en "\e[4q" | bc);<n>    echo $a $b | column -t -s $'\t'<n>done<n>``` <n><n>`echo -en "\e` [character]`:" | bc` is a way to output the data in binary. Here the character `[4q` would show a box in the screen and `:` will show a `tab`. Using this way we could show the whole sentence in three blocks. It helps the person who would like to do manual calculations.<n><n>**Explanations of A2**<n><n>We use the simple `for` loop to calculate the total of amount of nuts and dried fruits. We iterate the items in the list once so that we can take `item(i) / 1000` which is the amount of 1 item in the list. At the end we use `[a+b]` to get the total amount of nut and dried fruits and use `bc` command to do binary calculation.<n><n>**For Loop 3**<n><n>`echo -e "The\

What can she use her 300 vocabulary words to do with her essay? Choices: A: speak on the phone B: order food C: study foreign languages  D: use the Internet E: read books<n>Output: D<n><n>Note: The goal of the puzzle is to get you to learn the data structures and algorithms at the core of computing, so answers that involve writing simple programs are not correct.<n>The answer to the first puzzle is 56 because his total purchases must cost what is stated in the question.<n><n>Note: For the example above, the correct answer for question 1 was: 56. The key here is 1 kilo of nuts cost $12 and 1 kilo of dried fruits cost $8. How much was total? What would this look like on a receipt? $4 * 3 + 4 * 2.5 = $56.50. So, the correct answer was 56. This is where the question goes bad. Adam bought a half-a-kilo of nuts and a half kilo of dried fruit. He did not buy 3 and 2.5! This is where it says "One kilogram", not three-and-one fourths. This is poorly written and makes this question useless.<n><n>The answer to the second puzzle is B. One can use ungulates to kill, so you could shoot at them. I don't understand how it's overkill. What is an ungulate? It's the plural of "ungulate". An ungulate is a non-ruminant horned animal. So "ungulates" is plural. An "ungulate" is singular. For instance, a deer is an ungulate.<n>So then, "Can I cannon off of your back?" would not be OK. But "Can I cannon at your back?" would be OK.<n>If you cannot make sense of this, then the answer is A, because people are the opposite of ungulates. (I don't think he would shoot at people with a cannon.)<n><n>The answer to third puzzle is A. A person is usually a human,

In fact, the names are the same. Someone thinks that programming is harder than programming, but it doesn’t matter. “Software Engineer” is generally a very respected term, and “coder” is usually meant to be less desirable, but it isn’t very common yet.<n><n>### **[Answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-a-programmer-and-a-coder)**<n><n>*A programmer is an expert of software development*.A software development engineer deals with the technical details of the software, as well as the design and implementation of the new programs.<n><n>*A coder is an expert who codes*<n><n>>What a Coder does: <n><n>* They can make any program work in a logical way*<n><n>* They convert the language (which is used by programmers) into a program in C++, C, Java, or Python.*<n>>What a programmer does:<n><n>* They create software architecture*<n><n>* They think abstractly when it comes to problem-solving*<n>* They also focus on finding the best solution to the problem *<n><n>### **Output:**<n><n>* A coder can only make a program work in a logical manner * (wrong).

Choices:  A: run programs B: play games C: control model D: power down E: reason exists<n>Output:		D: power down<n><n>### Question:What is the definition of Scope Resolution Operator?<n><n>A: an operator used to refer to a class, interface, enum, static method, or any other static concept in the current programming environment.<n><n>B: an operator used to reference a class, interface, or any other static concepts in the current programming environment that the programming language knows about.<n><n>C: an operator used to make a variable visible within a function or inner block when it would not be visible otherwise.<n><n>D: an operator used to limit a variable’s scope using either public, private, or protected modifiers.<n><n>E: an operator used to call member functions.<n><n>### Solution:Scope resolution operators in C++ are a class of operators. They are used for calling virtual functions or constructors, referencing base class members, and explicitly invoking member functions that override functions with the same name and parameter list in the base classes. Scope resolution operators are also referred to as the dots operator. When the dot operator is used in conjunction with the name of a member function, the function calls the virtual function or the constructor if the parameter list is not specified. The dot operator can be used to explicitly invoke member functions. If no parameter list is provided, the function call invokes the first member function with the same name. The dot operator is also used when invoking virtual functions and referencing members of base classes.<n><n>The scope resolution operators are defined as follows:<n><n>. : A dot is used to refer to class members and access variables, functions, operators.<n><n>:: : To access the inherited constructors of the base class.<n><n>### Question How is the dot operator used to invoke C++ member functions?<n><n>A: A dot is used to invoke C++ virtual functions using the call by reference syntax.<n><n>B: A dot is used between a class name and the name of a member variable declaration.<n><n>C: A dot is used alongside the name of an operator as in “operator +”.<n><n>D: A dot is used as an operator in the “++” increment function.<n><n>E: A dot is used when invoking a constructor if no arguments are passed.<n><n>### Answer:<n>The dot operator is used alongside the name and parameter list of a member function in the manner shown in the following example.<n><n>cout << "Welcome to my Website";<n><n>Note:

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input:Where can you buy a binder? Choices:  A: college dorm B: back pack C: class room D: backpack E: office supply store<n>Output:		C.<n><n>Answered By: FawuziM<n><n>**Hey Fawuzi**, nice work!  A binder is a folder that people use in college.  If you said your answer was `E. Office Supply Store`,  that would be incorrect. A binder is not something you can find in an office,  rather you find them in `C. Classroom` and of course in `A. College Dorm`.<n><n>**What's The Point?**<n><n>If you read 100 resumes and you're trying to hire the best candidate, do you want to do the following:<n><n>1. Read the resume and if the resume has 10 years of work experience,  assume that the candidate does not have enough experience.<n>2. Read the resume but if you read "bachelors degree,"  assume that the candidate doesn't have a college degree.<n>3. Read the resume to check if they meet the basic requirements, which are a college degree and 5+ years of work experience.<n>4. Call the candidate and ask them about the resume, but only confirm the basic requirements.<n><n>**Hiring Myths About CV / Resume Review**<n><n>Let's examine each point above in more detail.<n><n>**Point 1: Assume that a candidate with 10+ years of work experience lacks experience**<n><n>This is a very dangerous assumption to make because the candidate could be a seasoned specialist.  A senior specialist is a very powerful thing in your team and the resume with 10 + years  of experience could be worth way more to a company than a recent graduate.  Hiring a more seasoned professional that will take charge of a very important job will save you the cost of training new employees.  That means instead of spending months training a younger employee that will cost thousands and thousands of dollars,  you are getting an employee that can jump in and start working the first day since they already know what to do.  Of course,  every situation is different,  but on the whole you don't want to rule somebody out if they have 10+ years because it just might happen to be the perfect person for a critical job.<n><n>**Point #2: Assume you can read college degrees**<n><n>Colleges are really tricky places.  Imagine a

"<n>-answerType:"int"<n><n>#### Explanation<n><n>-  Questions:<n>    -   The question that is being asked does not have enough information for you to figure out. For example, you can’t assume that Adam bought just nuts and fruits, he may have bought something else too. Additionally, the question is asking for the amount of dried fruit that he got but did not even mention how much he ate or used of each kind of food. In order to calculate this answer you would have to know two things about Adam’s shopping:<n><n>      1) The amount of dried fruit and nuts he  bought<n><n>      2) What exactly he paid for them.<n><n>-  Answer: The question asks “How much did his purchases come at a store cost?”. If we follow our guide on how to solve a multiple choice question, the answer is: <n><n>      c) 1kg of dried fruit costs 8 dollars<n><n>      and 3kg of nuts costs 12 dollars<n>      d) This can be calculated by $36<n><n>-  Source: In this example, you are asked to fill in two blanks with numbers. One of them is a kilogram, and the other is $12. Based on these two answers, we can conclude that $36 would be an answer that would work if it were given in dollars. If it were given in cents then we would still have to calculate $36. But in this case since this question is asking us for dollars, we can just assume that $36 would work for this solution.<n><n>-  Example: A man was driving himself to a meeting

It is important for you to realize that the examination takes up a large part of your grade. For this reason, you should be very well prepared for this section. There are some fundamental tricks and tips you need to know about. The examinations are multiple choice of this format:<n><n>Input: Adam ate a kilogram of nuts and then bought another kilogram of nuts.  How much did the nuts weigh?<n>Output: 4<n><n>A trick you must learn and understand is that you MUST ALWAYS USE PERFECT TIMSING. It is a skill that can be learned and practiced. It is fundamental for success in the competitive examination. Perfect timing allows you to process a question extremely fast while at the same time not rushing it. It also allows you to read the choices and eliminate those not corresponding to your answer. <n><n>You will be shown the "Input" and then the "Output". The "Input" will have 4-7 letters at the beginning followed by 1-3 blank spaces for the answer. The answer cannot have a blank or multiple numbers. You must type the correct letter in the blank.

It is NOT always correct. It is very likely that it is correct, but it might not be.

You will find this to be one of the toughest parts of any test you may take during your studies.<n><n>In this particular example, the effect of driving in the mud and dirt is going to be the same as the "Output".  This example is very easy; the effect of the car having to drive on mud and d

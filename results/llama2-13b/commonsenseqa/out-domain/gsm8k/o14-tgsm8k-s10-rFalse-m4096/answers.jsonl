{"idx": 161, "text": "A,B,D\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below in short answers.\n\n### Question:Explain what's meant by dynamic allocation, in computer memory.\n\nAnswer: In computing, dynamic allocation (also referred to as dynamic memory allocation) is a memory management approach whereby portions of the program's code or data are stored on the heap, while the rest may be stored on the stack, statically allocated, or both. This is as opposed to static allocation, whereby portions of memory are allocated in such contexts, including global variables, statically allocated objects, and parameters, and are stored on the stack or data segment during compilation. It is possible for the compiler to decide where to place memory allocations for code (static allocation) or data (static data allocation) as it compiles. However, it is not possible to do so for code and data that was not written into the program at compile time. This includes function calls, parameters to functions, return values from functions, class instances, and dynamic memory. Therefore, the programmer must specify dynamic memory allocations at run time. \n\n### Question What's the difference between stack and heap memory in Python?\n\nAnswer: In Python, memory on the stack is used to determine the call stack, a data structure that shows which function calls led to a current frame of execution. In other words, the stack keeps track of the current state of the programming environment. The memory on the heap is used when you pass objects as arguments. Heap-based objects are automatically garbage collected when they are no longer being used. When you create a Python list, the list object is automatically stored on the heap. Python uses lists as data types and objects for creating large amounts of data, such as records in a database or pages in a web browser.\n\n### Instructions:  Answer the following multiple-choice questions:\n1. When to use `importlib.import_module`\n\nAnswer: \n\n### When to use `importutil.import_mdule()`:\n\n### Question1: Suppose you had a function or piece of code that was going to be used many times in many disparate locations, and it needed to be set up the same way each time.

While they have a long way to go, the first step will be to use a phonetic alphabet. \n\nInstead of words of individual letters, they decide to use a combination of digits and symbols that represent parts of their speech. Each digit represents a phoneme, a distinct unit of sound in the speech they produce.\n\nAs before, your task is to help them assemble and test their puzzles.\n\n### Task 1: The Digits\n\n* 4697 digits:\n  * A sequence of digits.\n  * All digits are from the set 0123456789.\n  * One number is a palindrome.\n  * Sum of all digits in a number is prime.\n* 5921 digits:\n  * Digit sequences are pairs.\n  * The first digit is the only 0.\n  * The second digit is > 3.\n  * If the second digit > 7, the sum of both numbers is a palindrome digit string. \n\n### Task Description\n\nThe elves decide to base their phonemes on a subset of the digits from their previous counting system.\n\n* Each digit represents a phonenome.\n* Digits that are not part of the alphabet do not mean anything.\n* Letters are not required to be unique.\n* They choose their phonemes to be easy to say, rather than to represent each sound in all languages. \n* Each phoneme may have varying length and number of sounds that follow different pronunciation rules.\n* They may be more than one way to write this same phoneme.\n\n### Some Examples\n\n* The phoneme \"aa\" sounds like a double pronounciation of the same sound.\n* The phonemes \"ae\" and \"aen\" sound the same.\n* The phoneemes \"eou\" and \"eaou\" sound the same. \n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Ideas\n\n- Create an Array of Lists, with length 20, key length 1 and each of the first 18 elements empty.\n- Use for loops", "answer": "B: fragile"}

On a player\u2019s turn, they remove any number of objects from one of the heaps, provided they remove at least one object. The player who takes the last object wins. If the number of objects remaining in all the heaps is even after a move, the player must leave one or more objects in every heap to avoid being forced to take the last object on their next turn (referred to as a forced move in the games literature).

{"idx": 307, "text": "B\nExplanation: We can see that \"swim\" starts with \"s\" and \"rock\" starts with \"r\". \"Swim\" is 4 letters whereas \"jog\" is 3 letters. Since \"o\" is after \"s\", you can eliminate \"swim\" and choose between \"jog\" and \"rock climb\" and, from the answer choices, you can see that \"og\" is after \"s\" and, from the clue that the answer is two letters long, you can see you can choose between \"j\" and \"k\" and \"k\" falls after \"j\".So, the answer would be \"jog\".\n\n### Question:What is the most common name for a pet dog? Choices: A: Charlie B: Charlie C: Charlemagne D: Charlemagne\nOutput: A\nExplanation: From the clue,\nWe know that the answer is two words and it's three letters long but the last letter is \"m\" and \"e\" comes after \"m\". The answer should start with \"C\" and \"c\" is after \"b\".\nAlso, from the clue \"most common\", the answer \"Charlie\" is the best option.\n\n### RIDDLES \n### Question: What can you catch but never throw?

You've provided 3 blocks of what appears to be code that I suspect is supposed to \"solve\" the problems.  What is wrong with the code? Does it compile? Does it run? If it runs, does it produce correct answers?  It's really important to ask questions instead of make statements; your question should be something that can be answered here (e.g. \"What is wrong with my code?\") and you should tell us what problem you are having with code instead of making statements about how much something sucks :) and in particular you should include what is your desired result for your code.\n\nComment: Also, if the data above is coming from an input test case that was used to test your code, it would be great if you could provide the test cases too.  The input cases I see above don't look like test cases to me, and it would be better if you could use a tool like a [Markdown Table](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to make questions with a few sample test cases rather than having to copy and paste the cases from your comment.\n\nAnswer: `Input:`", "answer": "C: playroom"}

[Java Calculator](https://coderevie.wurmpy.net/questions/219554/java-calculator-part-1)\n\nAnswer: You have a great start here and I like your variable names very much! It's pretty clear when I look at it what this calculator is doing, and how it works. I've got a few recommendations on a few details, but by and large, you're doing a great job!\n\n\\section{The Basics}\n\nRight off the bat, I like your naming style. It's very consistent, and very clear why you are referring to variables, and what they represent. Very nice job! That's always the first thing I'll look for when reviewing code.\n\n\\section{Further Improvement}\n\nYour `promptInput` has a couple of quirks that don't align with Python naming style. Right now, your naming style suggests that it's a function, but it returns nothing. This is a bad sign because functions can only return values.\n\nIn Python, functions have their names prefixed with a lowercase letter, and do one thing. They return values when necessary, not functions. I believe your `promptInput` is also doing a bit of work (it's iterating over the question list, and asking questions until `promptYesAndNo` is called). For this reason, I would recommend you change it to the following, so that `promptInput` handles everything from asking questions, to validating input, to iterating.\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef promptInput():", "answer": "D: poker game"}

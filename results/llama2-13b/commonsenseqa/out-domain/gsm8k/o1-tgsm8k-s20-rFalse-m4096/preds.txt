### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid<n>Output:		A<n><n>##### Hint:This is fairly simple. We know the size of one container and that the other has fewer.We can simply calculate the difference between these container sizes and then compute it is as if the other container was the size of the first less<n>that difference.<n><n>We can see this through the following:<n><n>Let $x$ be the size of Tapanga's container.<n>Then we have,<n>$$x + 8 = 66$$<n>Now,<n>let $y$ be the size of Corey's container.<n>Thus,<n>$$y + 8 = 58$$<n>But now we can solve the last equation for $y$ and give it to the first as $y = x - 8$<n>Thus,<n>$y = 48$<n>### You have been given the following code: <n>```python<n>def func(x, y):<n>  if(x > -y and y > 0):<n>    return x + y - y<n>  else:<n>    return None<n>```<n>You have to create a code that performs the same functionality but should only use the ternary operator.<n><n>##### HInt:There is no straight forward way to convert this code to use the ternary statement. We can get close, but this will not be an exact conversion. Consider the following code:<n><n>```python<n>def funcalternative(x, y): <n>    result = None<n>    if x!=None:<n>        result = x + y - y <n>    else:<n>        result = y<n>```<n>When performing the following computations, you should notice we are missing functionality. The reason this is not a simple conversion is due to the fact that you are only provided the ternary operator and thus you must utilize every feature of that operator, and that it not always possible depending on the needs of the function.<n>

The average price of gold today is \$1588 per troy ounce (that's about the weight of a large apple). Because gold is worth so much, many people are drawn to it and are willing to do anything—and I mean anything—to get their hands on it. Because of this, the demand for gold is high, and the supply is low (you can't just start digging gold out of your backyard).<n><n>Gold's value depends on what the world's economy is like. During times when the economy is unstable or there are a lot of conflicts going on, demand for gold increases. This makes gold worth more.<n><n>Here is a graph of gold's price over the last few years with a projection for the future.<n></br><p align="center"><img src="/images/Chapter 8 - Reading graphs.png" alt="Chapter 8 - 01" width=800 /></p><n><n>Which of these statements is true about the graph above?<n><n><!-- <img width=700 src="/images/Ch17Quest4_2.png"> --><n><n>1. The price of gold is increasing by about $0.56 per month.<n>2. The price of gold has been steadily decreasing for the last two years.<n>3. The price of gold increases a lot more during summer and fall than it does during spring and winter.<n>4. Gold is expected to cost $7,000 an ounce by the end of 2019.<n>5. The price of gold will likely reach the end-of-2015 level sometime around April or May.<n><n></br><n></br><iframe src="/images/Ch21Quest1_2

Note that the 60 minutes parking is the only parking space that can accommodate the 60 minutes of time.  Therefore, no cars have a space to remain standing.   As a 4-second vehicle enters, we want to know which of the 4 vehicles should be able to move.  Note that no one in 60-minutes will be affected because they all have full time already.  <n>However, the state of the two vehicles in the 30-60-minute zone will change.  <n>So among the two cars, the last one with 5 minutes is still able to stay put, and can get in 1-minute from C before the parking meter expires.<n><n>#### Source of Problem: 5.1

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:What kind of driving leads to accidents? Choices:  A: stressful B: dangerous C: fun D: illegal E: deadly<n>Output:		A<n><n>Answer: A<n><n><n><n>### Answer Explanation<n><n>**Output:** In this example, Tapanga has **8** candies more than Corey.<n><n>In the first part of the sentence, it states, "Tapanga and Corey", meaning that the answer must be something that can represent both of them. But Corey has 8 candies less than Tapanga, which is a possibility for him to have 27 candies.<n><n>For instance, we can have two possibilities that Tapanga has 54 and Corey has 27. Now, we can check if we can represent 66 with Tapanga as 54 and Coreys 27. To do so, we combine Tapangas 54 candies with Coreys 27 candies which gives us the sum of 81, which is more than 66.<n><n>Now, we can add one more candies to Tapanga to give her total of 55 and subtract one from Corey to make him have 26. Now, we get 55 added with 26, which gives us a sum of 81. Therefore, Tapangas total has to be more than 76. 76 is made up of 27 and 49 candies. This eliminates Corey as the winner of the 29 candies.<n><n>Thus, since Tapangas candies are 54 and Coreyls are 27, we make the choice of 54 + 27 which gives us a sum equal to 81 and not 81, thereby representing both of their candies. Therefore, the choice is B.<n><n><n>

A person who is cold and distant, is not very approachable and it might be difficult for others to have a deep conversation with them.<n><n>This does not fit line number 2. Let us keep trying.<n><n>So, we have to replace the 'A' with 'C' and the '9' with '3'<n><n>We now have,<n><n>C-L(e)OF<n><n>'C' means 'Cold and distant' or 'not caring'<n><n>Line number 3: If a person is cold and distant, that does not mean that he is'very open to change.' A cold person will not be very open to change too. They might not react to new situations or ideas.<n><n>This does nto fit choice number 1 because open is the antithesis of 'not caring. '<n><n>Therefore,<n><n>C-LEOF<n><n>'C-' means 'Cold' or 'C'<n><n>'Leo' refers to the constellation. To think of the constellation of Leo, we think of lions.  Think of lions for a moment.

Choices: A: 0 B: 5 C: 10 D: 15 E: 20<n>Output: B<n>\end{code}<n><n>I got it wrong, I think I know why; it has something to do with how they ask about the variables. They don't actually say how many variables there are nor do they say how many choices a correct variable can be.<n><n>I think this might work:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>class Solution:<n>    def __init__(self):<n>        self.tapanga_candies = 8<n>    def countCorey(self, t, c):<n>        """<n>        :type t: int<n>        :type c: int<n>        :rtype: int<n>        """<n>        ans = (self.tapanga_and_candies - self.tapanga)<n>        return ans<n>\end{code }<n><n>Notice how I wrote `self.tapanga`? I'm not sure of that. How would I write that variable such that I can actually manipulate it? It looks like they want the variable to become Tapanga in the next line of code. My other concerns are that `self.tapagna and candies` might not be correct, but if I write `self.tapang_and_candied` then it's probably wrong. Would it be okay if I wrote `self.candies_eaten`? I'll change it to `self.candied_eaten` later on.<n><n>Another concern I have is that they don't actually state what the `type` of `self`. How do I get around that?<n><n>Answer: You seem to have a good grasp of the algorithm, it is mostly about what is the best way to implement it.<n><n>First, you are correct that you have to manipulate variables to get the correct answer:<n><n>\begin {code}<n><n>tapanga_c = 8<n>tapanga_andcandy = 94 - tapanga_c # 94 - 8 = 86<n>corey_c = tapanga - tapanga_c<n><n>print(corey_c) # 29<n>\end{code}.

The two choices'sleep' and'sleeping' are wrong because they do not make sense in this sentence.  'waking', 'awaken', and 'waking up' do not make sense because they do not use the word 'awakeme' as a noun.  Therefore, the answer is  E: 'awake'.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input : <n><n>Sentence: The house made of woven glass<n><n>Question: Replace the highlighted word with the answer below that is closest in meaning.<n><n>Outputs <n><n>None of the above  <n>a: A glass house is a house that is made of glass and built of glass.  <n>b: She wanted to make a new glass house.<n>c: A house made of glass does not have a roof or walls to protect it from wind or rain. <n><n>### Answer <n><n>This question is asking us to find which option has the meaning that is closest to Glass Houses. One of the key parts of this question is the phrase "woven glass." The word "woven" adds an extra layer of meaning to the phrase. Woven glass means "woven together, woven fabric, made of multiple components, created by weaving together multiple strands." This adds a new aspect of meaning to the phrase that can't be found in other options.<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>Input: <n><n>Outputs:<n><n>None of these options<n>a: A home made of glass does not require a roof or walls to keep wind and rain from entering.  <n>b: It was a terrible storm when he saw the house made of glass. <n>c: A glass house is made of glass and made of glass.  <n><n><n>### The answer to this question is:<n><n>This question is a bit more complicated.  We are looking to change the highlighted word in the sentence. The word is "house" and the original sentence is: "The house made of woven grass." Our options include: <n>A glass house does not require a roof and walls to keep wind and water out. a new glass house  <n>She wants to create a glass house.  <n>b

Choices:  A: picnic B: friend's house C: table D: space shuttle E: fairgrounds<n>Output:		picnic<n><n>Answer: **Solution:Above mentioned questions are similar to **[Question 2](/q/5c2419a0765f0c69cbe1c81c/16768287). There are 5 options each in all of the questions but answer will be same.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>You can see there is an array of question list & 5 options to each question list. First we iterate through this array by using recursion & we call this function with the question & its options. If we are in first iteration then we have to find the right question. So we are checking the length of the question list equal "1" because the first iteration is on question & in second iteration we are checking the length equal to "5". After that we check the answer of the question is equal to the result of options. If it is equal then we have to return that answers else it will continue to next iteration.<n><n>If we are in first step we are checking that answers is correct or not as I said before. So you can understand that it will go second step if both result is equal to each other else it continue to next iteration. After that you can print options by using index of question as shown below in image.<n><n>Note: For any problem you can refer above code of this solution. If you understand solution of this problem then you can easily solve any problem. <n><n>**References: [Link](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17653)<n>![](/assets/question-with-answer-17653).**<n>

Like other stars, the Sun goes through periods when it produces more energy or burns "hotter" and times when it doesn't produce as much energy and burns "cooler." This cycle, called the solar cycle, lasts on average 11 years. The duration of this cycle varies. The sun may have less activity for several years in a row. Conversely, this cycle can be longer and have more energy in a single year than usual.<n><n>Severe Space Weather Conditions can be disrupted due to changes in the solar cycle. This can range from communications satellites being disrupted to electrical systems and power grids on earth being compromised. Solar activity can also interfere with GPS systems and cause airplanes to be delayed due to stormy conditions.<n><n>Many solar flares and coronal mass explosions erupt on the Sun each week. Sometimes, solar flares will be in the path of the Earth and cause magnetic storms. Magnetic storms can interrupt power grids, GPS signals, and disrupt communications systems and satellites. They can also cause the northern lights.<n><n>The Earth will experience its own magnetic storm if it comes into contact with a large amount of energy. This is not a real threat. Magnetic storm refers to a powerful solar flare that produces a magnetic storm on Earth. Earth-facing flares can be disruptive. There are usually very many flares on our side of the face, so there is a significant risk of damage to communication satellites and high-frequency communications.<n><n>The Sun will also experience large sun flares. Coronal Mass Blasts (CMEs), are explosions that expel energy in the form of charged particles. These explosions are so large that they can be felt on Earth. Coronal Mass Blast is a massive explosion at the Sun. CMEs do not cause earthquakes but can cause magnetic storms which in

Choices:  A: cafeteria B: arranging papers C: in the park D: formal dining room E: house<n>Output:		D<n><n><n><n>### Question:<n>```<n>Write an arithmetic function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.<n>```<n><n>###Instruction:<n>You may use the sum function I provided below if you want to use it. But this question does not require that. And if you use sum, you shouldn't copy my code, so it would be considered as cheating.<n><n>###Answer:<n><n>I did do the first question above, so here is a function called add that takes two inputs x and y, and outputs their sum.<n><n>```python<n>def add(x, y):<n>    return x+y<n>```<n><n>I did an inefficient version but it still works.<n><n>I did the function to add 5 numbers using a for loop. First I did the code to add 2 numbers.<n><n>I took in 4 numbers and summed them up, then I summed them with the 1st number together.<n><n>```python4<n>num_1 = 1<n>num_2 = 2<n>num_3 = 1<n>num = 3<n>numSum = 0<n>firstSum = 0<n>num_4 = 2<n>numSum = 1<n>numSum = 2<n>num = 30<n>aSum = 0<n>numberSum = 0<n>sum = 0<n>for i in range(1,30):<n>    aSum = aSum + 1<n>    numberSum = (num )+ (numSum)<n>for i in range (1, 30): <n>for i in range() :<n>    numberSum =0<n>    numberSum = numberSum * 1 + sum * 1<n>```<n><n>When I got the number right, I did it to add them with 5 numbers. However, even though the result was right, the process was inefficient. I took in five numbers and had to loop it for a few times and at the end, I add them up, and it wasn't the fastest, but it worked for 5 numbers.<n><n>

The formula is 3(n+2)(n+1) or 3(n+3)(n+2).<n><n>Using this information we can develop the following code<n><n>```<n> if (n <0) {<n>        System.out.println("That would be negative values");<n>     error = true;<n>}<n>else{ <n>     long result = (long) (3*(n)*(n+1));<n>      System.out.println(result);<n>}<n>```<n><n>Thus the code could be modified to include an error handling statement such as the following<n><n>```<n> if (!error) {<n>    System.out.println (result);<n>    }<n>}else{<n>    System.out("That would be negative numbers");<n>    }<n>```<n><n>We can test our code using the input n =-10, 0, 1, 10.

But a different person  gives the answer for question 2, then question 3, then question 1. If you had a function `calculate` that gives you back a non-zero number, you could make a function `get(char answers[])` that would return the question number corresponding to the index of `answers` where the bit set to 1 is. e.g. `get(4,answers == '1000'))` which tells you that the person answered question 2. Finally, you could make a string outputter function `show(char qn,char answer)` that would output `answers = "expect to die"`.<n><n>##### However, it's simpler to use the above data structure.

There is no vaccine for this kind of dog. The girl's mother is worried that her daughter will contract rabies. She is considering taking her daughter to the doctor immediately but she is uncertain due to cost. Her insurance covers some of the cost, but there is still an out of pocket payment.<n>##### 80 percent of the cost of this service will be covered and the cost for the test will be $85; the family will need to pay that along with a $40 exam fee. However, the total cost for the office visit and the test will be $35.<n><n>-The out-of-pocket cost, with insurance coverage and the cost of the test, is $125.

We just need to get the exact quantity of Tapanga candies and the exact quantity of Corey candies, and then use the following equation to obtain the answer:<n>$$<n>\sum(input1) - \sum(input2) = sum(output)<n>$$<n>However, we know that Tapanga has 38 candies, while Corey has 29 candies.<n>Hence the equation is already solved:<n>$$<n>38 - 29 = 29<n>$$<n>Hence we get that Corey has 28 candies.<n><n>It is to be noted that in all multiple choice questions, the question itself has the answers as well. We just need to look for them and then plug them in.<n>So in this example, we could directly see that "wealthy and flaunts" answers were the one we are looking for,<n>although in real world, such answers are often made subtly to pass the verification process.<n><n></details><n>

One of each will have a print statement.  On the other tab of the web browser window, we will write the test code.  In the test code, we check that the answers produced the the ones we expect for each test case.<n>  <n>```javascript<n>var Tapanga_Candy = 28<n>var Corey_Candy = 18<n>var candy_difference = Tapanga_Canday - Corey_Candy<n>```<n>After testing that the code is good, we will go back and add the print statement to the "question."  The print statement will tell us what we know about Tapanga and Core's candy.  Next, we will "ask" the machine to answer our question with this line:<n><n>```javascript<n>document.write(candy_difference)<n>```<n><n>When we go back to the "question" tab, we want ot check that our answer is right.

Choices:  A: eternal B: religious C: unpredictable D: holy E: monastic<n>Output:		B<n><n>Input: Which of the following statements is not true?<n>I. An element's mass depends only on its charge.<n>II. Coulomb's law states that there is an inverse-square relationship between the amount of charge, Q, on one object and the amount of charge, q, on a second object at separation r.<n>III. The total energy of an atom is conserved between the nucleus and electrons<n>Output: II<n><n>### Answer Explanation:<n><n>* The correct answer is 'B'<n><n>The relationship is C,q, & r is equal to the square of its distance from each other divided by k.<n><n>C is the constant known as Coulomb's constant. To prove the point, let's look at the example:<n><n>Suppose you have the charges +2C on object A and -2C on object B. The magnitude of the force of attraction between these two objects is (24π) divided by k. If you bring the charges even closer to each other, you will still get (24π) / k. Increasing the distance between the charges will result in the force repelling.<n>

If no, how would you advance your knowledge? What resources are available? What skills would you like to gain more control over in Python? How would you go about advancing your Python skills if you are given more time. What resources should you seek next?<n><n>   -I feel that this was a very good assignment. I learned a lot about Python and how they work and how I can utilize them in future projects. I did learn a lot about Python from this class. Python will be useful for more of the AI/ML and web projects. Overall, I think python was good for the class. I would seek the help of this assignment when I use Python more in the future.<n><n>-Reflect on why you selected the answers in the second part. Do you think being a native speaker helps with learning English? If so, explain why?<n><n>   -It was an interesting question in class. I never thought about it, but being a native speaker of English might help you learn English. It makes more sense to you since it is easier to understand what the english words mean. A native speaker probably understands a lot of the words already since it is their own native language. A native Spanish language might have a lot of difficulty translating english into spanish and visa versa.<n><n>-What is the most important skill you learned in this class

Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n>Output:		D: social activism<n><n>### Tip<n><n>In an earlier chapter we saw that variables can be reused. This is helpful if we want to refer to a variable (such as `person` in `cats_or_dogs` to ask a separate question about them. To do this, we wrap them in the `let` keyword to create a new definition so all variables can be used in the expression (even if they're redefined). So, for example:<n><n>```elixir<n>if cat_owner == 1 do<n>  let person = "#{cat_owner} people love cats."<n>else<n>  let person = #{dog_owner}, people love dogs."<n>end<n>```<n><n>In the `case/2`, we can also use `else` to handle both the `cat_owner == 1` and `dog_owner == 1`. We can combine it into a single message:<n><n>```elioxir<n>"#{cat_owner}, or #{dog_owner} persons love #{if cat_owner == dog_owner, cat, cat, dog}s"<n>```<n>

Suppose that the following statement is a theorem in the axiomatic theory of groups:<n><n>Suppose that $G$ is a group and $\phi$ is a function from $G$ to real numbers, such that for all $x$ in $G$, $\phi(x^{-1})=\phi(x)$. <n><n>Prove that<n>$$\phi(a) \cdot \phi(b) = \phi(a \cdot b)$$<n>for all $a$ and $b$ in $G$.<n><n>[Hint: 1] For example, suppose that $G$ is the group $Z/6Z$, whose elements are the integers modulo 6, and $\phi$ maps $G$ to real integers in such a way that $\phi(x^{-2}) = -\phi(x)$ and $\phi(x^{-i}) = \phi(x)$ for all integers $i$.  In this case, the function $\phi$ is determined by the value of $\phi(0)$.<n><n>[Hint:2] For another example, suppose that $X$ is a set and that $G = Hom(X,Z/6Z)$.  For each function $f$ in $G$, define $\phi(f)$ by $\phi(f)(x) = f(x) \cdot 1$ for all $x$.  (Here $\cdot 1$ is short for `multiplied by the element 1 of $Z/6Z$.)  It follows that $\phi(f^{-2}) = -\cdot 1 = 1$, so $(\phi(f^{-2}))^{-1} = -\phi(f^{-2})$, and hence<n>$$\phi(f^{-1}) = \phi(f^{-2})\cdot (\phi(f^{-2})^ {-1}) = (\cdot 1) \cdot (\cdot 1) = \cdot 1.$$<n><n>Answer:<n><n><n>To start, we will define the term a group.

However, this has very high possibility of failure when you don't know what to expect as the user input. <n>What if there are options that are in between the first and second (such as chicken) or the last and second (such as tuna) or first and last (such as kitchen cupboard). <n>More importantly, when a user input something that cannot be matched to any of the four potential choices (such as potashios, potatoes, or pottery), the program will return an  error.<n><n>## If Else If Approach(First option)<n><n><n>def main() -> None:<n>	chicken=[False,False,False,False]<n>	kitchen_cupboard=[False,False,True,False]<n>	tuna=[False,False, False,True]<n>	pantry=[True,False,False,True]<n>	maryland=[False,False, True,True]<n>	answer=""<n>	word ="maryland"<n>	<n>	<n>	word = input("what word is associated with potatos?")<n>	answer = word.lower()<n>	if not answer:<n>		print("\nEnter a word")<n>		main()<n>	elif answer == maryland:<n>		print("It is the correct answer")<n>	elif answer == "chicken" or answer == "tuna" or answer == "kitchen cupboard" or answer == "pantry":<n>		print("Sorry that's not the answer")<n>	else:<n>		print(f"Incorrect answer, You didn't answer any of our choices {word,kitchen_cupboard,pantry,tuna,chicken,maryland}")<n><n>	<n>		<n><n># Solution:<n><n>In this approach, you are building a list of potential answers to compare with input. You can also add an optional list of correct answers to check against to make your code less buggy. However, you will always get an input where you cannot match any of the options.<n>For example "

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: medicine chest C: armpits D: grocery store E: kitchen<n>Output:		B. A, C, and E are unrealistic. D is wrong because deodorant is not technically groceries.<n><n>### Submission:<n><n>```python<n>def multiple_choice(input, test_case):<n>    if test_case == "3":<n>        if input == "A" or input == "C" or input == "E":<n>            return True<n>    else:<n>        result = False<n>        start = test_case.find("A")<n>        while start!= -1:<n>            if test_case[start+1:].strip() == input.strip():<n>                # end index<n>                end_index = test_case.index(input, start+1)<n>                result = True<n>                break<n>            start = start + 1<n><n>        return result<n>```<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>I found one of the test cases a little bit confusing. However, once I noticed that if I knew the answer to **any** of those options other than deodorant, I would simply compare the answers with those in the test case and check which option exists in other than the last one, which is correct.<n><n>

Consider a sequence of numbers between 1 and 100 that has exactly five 6s. To make such a sequence, start with the first number, 1, that has as many of the other four digits as you possibly can, and then add a 6 after each 6 you have encountered. The sequences "16666" and "61666" are good examples.<n><n>### Hint<n>You will want to count how many times a certain digit is present.

Choices:  A: sign language B: complete sentence C: drink tea D: feel angry E: cross street<n>Output:		A<n><n>Answer:<n>(10). For this problem we will need to make a comparison between the two numbers. In the first step, we should compare the number on the left side of the inequality sign to 0, which is the number we want in both left and right sides we subtract 1, and add 1 to the inequality sign to make it an equal sign, and finally we need to perform another comparison between the two numbers after adding -8 to the number on the right side of the inequality sign. The answer will be 0 - 8 = 29 so the Answer will be **C**.<n>(11). For this problem we need to find the correct synonym for an incomplete sentence.  The only option that seems to fit was A. So the answer will be **A**.<n><n><n><n>Answer: (10) First step: The candy Tapanga has is 8 more than Corey which is: 8 + c.<n><n>Second step: c = 90 -> 8 + c = 98 (1 is added because the answer choices are not integers)<n><n>So, Corey has 98 - 8 = 90 c.<n><n>Answer: (9).

Lucene indexes all fields in a document, creating an inverted index. The inverted index contains one document for each stored word (terms), one index term (position) for each word in each document and a data record for each document. The document is made up of the field and the term where it was found.<n>Solr indexes documents.<n>In Solr, documents are indexed to provide a search capability. The solr indexer is a process that processes the input documents. It is usually launched automatically, but it can also be started by hand (and run in batch mode).<n><n>Solr indexing is a process in which:<n>\begin{itemize}<n>\item The solr indexer reads a (possibly) huge number of documents,<n>\item it identifies all fields (of certain type) in those documents,<n>\item and produces the index where each field is represented by a number of documents and where each document contains one<n>or more references.<n>\end{itemize}<n><n>Solr is not a standalone application: it is a distributed, open-source Java-based HTTP search engine used in conjunction with a search server (such as Apache Lucene). Solr can index any type of information, which gives it the ability to store information in an easy-to-retrieve manner.<n><n>The output of Solr is an index file. The Solr index file is a binary, text-based file with a file extension of "solr". An SOLR engine will search a Solr index file. When the search begins, each term from the search request is compared to the search index using the term frequency and inverse document frequency (TFIDF) algorithm.<n><n>Solr is an open-source, schema-free search server that facilitates full text search, hit highlighting and advanced features such as dynamic clustering, faceted search and spell correction. Solr is very fast, scalable and easy-to-setup. Apart from standard retrieval features, Solr also provides high-performance indexing capabilities and many other features that make it suitable for Internet scale search applications.<n><n>Comment: This answer seems to not address the question at all.

I knew I could find it by looking at the ratio of the length to the width. I went to the ratio section of the chart on page 142 because I noticed that there were more questions about ratios and rate problems. I then found the ratio table on page 141. By looking up the ratio table I found that the length and the width is 10 feet and 9 feet, respectively.<n>### Where I got lost: I was confused for a second because I did not see questions pertaining to a circle. I was a puzzled. However, I overcame this obstacle by finding the right table in the chart and remembering that the rectangle had one less dimension than a square (a two dimensional flat object with four equal sides).<n>### How I improved: I made a mental note of what each page contained. I also reread the front of the book so I can remember that these type of questions are the way to get a glimpse at what is on the pages. I think I did pretty good on this section so that is the most I can do.<n><n><n>## My Math Study Hall<n>================<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>Use our website to answer the following questions.

But can we? Yes. If one takes into account the effects of gravity.  According to quantum theory, there is a very good chance that there is a parallel universe where the Earth is the size of a soccer ball.  This world would have to have the same laws as our own universe; therefore, if the universe is expanding, this parallel universe would be expanding at an equal rate.<n><n>Exerpt B:<n>The speed of light has been a topic of discussion and a point of frustration for scientists and physicists for generations. In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein stated in his article on relativity that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. In 2004, two teams of British physicists achieved speeds 25 times the speed of light. Although their results cannot possibly be explained, they are true.<n><n><n>1. The Earth is expanding.<n>2.

Choices:  A: vessel B: box C: transistor D: submarine E: lamp<n>Output:		D <n>Solution: Transistor<n><n>### Question:The following question consistis of a passage.<n><n>For decades in the past, the most efficient way to communicate to someone was using letters. However, the invention of the telegraph changed that.  The telegraph allowed people to communicate faster and with more accuracy. Before the telegraph, it could take weeks for news from a war to travel from one point to another and the telegraph allowed the news to be transmitted with almost the press of a button.<n>After the telegraph, telephones were created, followed by many other means of communication, but the telegraph remains very important until today.  It was used to send messages with the press of a button and with the use of a code. Telegraph systems were used for public communications. Some of the most famous code systems were the Morse Code, which is still used nowadays. The importance and effect of the telegraph cannot be understated. It has shaped the course of history and is considered as one of the most important and significant inventions of all time.<n><n>Which sentence represents evidence that communicating in the past took a long time?<n>A: For decades in the past<n>B: The telegraph allowed people<n>C: The invention of the telegaph changed that<n>D: Telephones were created after the telegaph<n>E: It was used to send news with the press of a switch<n> <n>### Question:<n>How can you use evidence from the the document to answer the question above?<n> <n>1. Read the passage to identify the evidence<n>2. Determine which of the options best match your evidence<n>3. The correct answer is letter C. <n> <n>### Explanation:<n>The passage states that the invention of the telegram changed the way that news was communicated around the world. <n> <n>Telegraph was important because it allowed messages to be communicated with the press of a single button.  It revolutionized the news industry because people were able to send messages with the click of a button.  <n> <n>### Practice Questions:<n>### Question:Read the passage below and answer the question.<n><n>Some students may not enjoy reading due to the following reasons:<n>1.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:The jar was plastic, just like most of the stuff in the kitchen.  John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n>Output:		A<n><n>Answer: This is just a basic multiple choice problem. You have a series of questions about a sentence. However, it is important that you understand how to do this type of problem in general. In a multiple choice question the answers will either be an answer based on the text (e.g. choice E would be "garbage dump" as Tapanga wanted to be anywhere but a plastic kitchen and this would be a garbage dump to him) or an answer that requires understanding of the question. In this case the question is: John wishes to be "Somewhere else", now this could be E) anywhere else, but the problem here is that "anywhere else" is an answer that does not refer to the text. The word somewhere means that he wants to be in a specific location. You are not going to be given the answer in the text. Thus, the correct answer would be A) cupboard. Because if you look at the text cupboards would be an answer that makes sense. Furthermore, if John wished to be a "cupboard" there wouldn't really be a question. Choices: A) cupboard B) anywhere else C) everywhere D) own home E) garbage dump

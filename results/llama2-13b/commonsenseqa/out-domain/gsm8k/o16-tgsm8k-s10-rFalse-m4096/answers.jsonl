If your code works for the previous two outputs and the current output is also correct, add a fourth output that determines and displays whether it's Day or Night, using the hour you found.**\n\n**Instructioins:Continue on your code to add a fifth output that determines and prints whether you should see the doctor or not. (See answer for instructions, I would also like to see your logic on this output.)**\n\n**Instruction: You have now programmed both day and night outputs for your code below. Print one of the appropriate outputs based on what time of day it is. For example, if it's noon, the code will print \"The sky above you is a vivid blue\". However, if it's 3am, the code will print, \"The night sky above you is full of stars.\"**\n\n**Instuctions:Add a second if statement below to the code that will print the sky in the daytime and then the stars in the night if a user enters daytime and nightime twice in a row. You should check your code to ensure that it prints the daytime output, then the nightime output even if nightime and daytime is entered three times in a row.**\n\n\n**Instruicions:Once the above instructions work as they are supposed to, your program should begin accepting only day or night. For example, if a user enters \"Day\" or \"day\", they shouldn't enter the word \"night\" again until the word \"day\" is re-entered.**", "answer": "E: office depot"}

The elements in this array are:\n\n1. The user input: A string describing what was entered by the player.\n2. Your character response to the user input.\n\nYou can add more characters if you'd like.\n\nWe start off with one character, and a basic list of responses which the player can use the keyboard to select.\n\nYou will also need to check if user enters a random character as input.\n\nFor example, if you have ````Ja'' and the user types in \"J\" then Ja will respond with \"Ah, hello there\".\n\nNow, we're going to define a function `go()` for each character in our text-based game which will\n\n* check if user inputs a random character (not in the list of options)\n\n* respond accordingly to valid user inputs\n\n* exit on invalid inputs\n\n```python\n\nimport random\nimport time\n\ndef go(name):\n character = ['Ja']\n\n def check_input():         # will return `True` if the user entered input is *Ja*\n        print(\"Here is a short list of options:\\n\")\n        print(character[0])\n        return \"Ja\" in input(\"\\n>", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

This problem was difficult because it forced you to use recursion which is pretty much an algorithm on steroids (not really but kind of).\n\nIf you would like to see a complete solution, see below:\n\n```\n\n**1. Instruction: **You are given a positive integer _N_ which we will call _L_. Create a function NxL that returns the result of L ^ _N_.\n\nInput: 3\nOutput: 24\n\nInput: 5\nOutput: 100\n\nInputs are between 1 and 100, inclusive.\n\n```\n\n```\n1. To begin this challenge, lets use the math we learned that x to the power of zero equals 0 where x can be any variable so 10.5 to the power of 0 should still be 0\n2. Now, let's go over the first challenge. We input 3 which should be our variable for our base case. So in our base case the variable becomes 3.\n3. Now, lets start with solving the challenge. First we say x = 1 and x = 3. Then we multiply both sides of the equation together and we do the same thing for the base case x = 3. Now we multiply all the exponents together so in this case we would get 1 ** 1 = 1 and 3 ** 3 = 9 so now our answer is 9 * 1 = 9\n4. Now back to our original problem, lets take our result from step 3 and apply that to the base case of x = 3. In this way, whenever we get to a larger number, we will use the base case as our result. So we will say ** x = 3 so we know that we got 9 ** 3\n5. So now we continue to multiply all the numbers together until it equals 1.\n6. Again we say **x = 3 and then **3, we get 9 ** 3 which is 729. So now we multiply all the numbers together", "answer": "B: play sports"}

{"idx": 390, "text": "D  answer: D  correct answer choice: D\n\nOutput:\nThe answer to question 1 is [2, 1], where the first sub-tuple answers the question: \"The number of goals scored in  a game against Barca\", and the second sub-tuple answers the questions: \"by exactly two players last season\".\n\nOutput:1:\n\nThe answer to question \"56\". The answer of this problem is 3 kg * 12\n\nOutput:2:\n\nThe answer would be 16-2/3 hours/week. \nThe answer can be obtained by first reading the question carefully: It says that John goes to the gym \"3 times per week\". But it says he spends \"1 hour \" each day lifting weights. \nIn English we normally read that as 1 hour every day.\nIf this is the case, 1 hour * 3 days/week = 3 hours / week.\nHowever, the question further says that he spends **\"a third of his weight lifting time warming up and \"doing cardio\" each day.**\"\n\nThis tells us that for the 1 hour of weight lifting, he also spends an additional 20 minutes warming up and doing cari. If you do this every day, that is ~1.67 hours / week.\nIf his entire weight lifting process takes 1.67 hours per day, then for **3 days/week**, he would spend 3 *1.67 = 5 hours/week weight lifting.\nAdd in the 3 hours weight lifting and 1.67 * 3 =  5.01 hours for the cardio and warming up for weight lifting.\nThe total becomes:\n5 hours/week weightlifting + 5.01 hours to warm up and do cardio before/after lifting weights\n**= 10.01 hours/week = ~ 2.5 hours per day**.\nThus, we have 2.5 hours * 3 days/ week = 7.5 hours a week, plus 1 day which has the \"warm-up\" and \"cardio\", which adds another 7.5 hours per week.\nTotal = **15 hours per week** spent at the gym. \n\nNote", "answer": "C: chinese food"}

However, if you are new to the world of computers and programming, you may not be familiar with the basic concepts of programming in Python.\n\nBefore you actually attempt to write your own program in Python, you should have some familiarity with basic Python syntax and operations. This will help you write an efficient and effective program that can solve a wide range of math problems, from basic arithmetic to more complex equations.\n\nSome basic concepts that you should be familiar with include:\n\n- Basic Mathematical Operations: Python has robust support for all the basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can use these operations to solve simple arithmetic problems like the ones in the Math Problems section.\n- Data Types: Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, and strings. You can use these data types to represent different types of numbers and text in your programs.\n- Conditional Statements: Conditional statements are used to execute certain code based on certain conditions. For example, you can use an if-else or a switch-case statement to check if a given condition is true or false.\n- Loops: Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. For example, an \"while-loop\" is used to execute a block code until a given condition is not true. Similarly, an \"for-loop\" is used for repeating a block code a certain number of times.\n- Functions: Functions are used to perform a specific task multiple times in a program. You can create your own functions to perform specific tasks, such as calculating the area of a circle or the sum of two numbers.\n- Modularity: Python is a highly modular language. This means that you can create separate modules in your program, and import them into your main code when needed.\n- Object-oriented Programming: Python supports object-oriented programming, which allows you to create classes and objects. You can use these classes and objects to represent different things in your program, such as numbers,", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

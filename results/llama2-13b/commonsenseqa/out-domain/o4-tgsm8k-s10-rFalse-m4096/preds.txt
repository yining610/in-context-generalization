Each players scored an equal number goals against Barca and the **total number of goals scored in games against Barca that season** is 300.<n><n>> **Answer: **<n>  Let's first define some variables to help us simplify things:<n>  <n>  - Total number goals scored in league : n<n>  - Number of goals scored against Barca in total : a<n>  - Total number of goals scored by player 1 against Barca : x<n>  - Total number fo goals scored by player 2 against Barca : y<n><n>  We know that: a =.20n and a = x+y<n>  If they both scored an equal number of goal, then we can say: x = y<n>  We also know that a = 300.  This is the **total number of goal scored in games against Barac in that season**.  So we can rewrite the equation as: (x+y) = 300<n>  Now we have the **number of goals** each player scored in **total** : x =200  and y = 200<n>  We also know the number of goals scored **against Barca** in a total : <n>  x + y = 0.20n = 60<n>  So the number of goals scored by each player against Barca is 30.<n><n></hr><n></details><n><n>### Answer Key <n><n><a name="AnswerKey"></a><n>### Answer Key<n><n>- [x] 1.

Choices:  A: poor B: sleepy C: plain D: needy E: homeless<n>Output:		D<n><n>### Solution Explanation<n><n>The main key point of this problem is to distinguish between the different operation types:  sum, multiplication, and order of operations.  These are all relatively simple operations, but if you have to calculate several operations sequentially, it can be easy to make a mistake since it is not very evident which operation your brain is performing.  For example, here is the problem with the above inputs:<n><n>$$ 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 $$<n>$$ 12*(12/11)*(12/11*0.2118) = 213.36 $$<n>$$ 1 * (\frac{1.5045+1.5042*1.15} {1.15-0.18})*1.2124 = 56/100 = 0.56 $$<n><n>The errors are all related to the ordering of mathematical operations (the order of operations) and the wrong use of parentheses.  The first was a simple multiplication mistake, but the other two involved order of operations.  For example, above Adam’s purchases should have been $26 per kg which is $52.  This error involved applying multiplication to both terms in the division first and then doing the division while ignoring the order of operations.

This set of inputs and outputs can be hard-coded into a small python script.<n>- While we could have used these inputs for the test cases, we thought that a larger set of inputs would be more interesting and useful.  The only catch is that you can't look up the answer in python documentation.<n><n>### How to solve it?<n><n>- Take inspiration from how Python modules are written so that the same output is generated.<n>- Here is an example of a builtin python function.<n><n>```python<n>>>> def count(words: List[str]) -> int:<n>...     return len(words)<n><n>>>> count(['one', 'two', 'three'])<n>3<n>```<n><n>- Note how the input is passed as a list containing strings?

Use the code in the sample solution script (Sample_Solution.js) as your guide.<n><n>Whenever people think about the worst jobs they have had, dishwasher comes up pretty often as one of the worst jobs people had. Given the type of work and the demands that you may have to work under, we all can certainly relate to how unpleasant of a job this was/is. But what exactly is a dishwasher? In order to answer this question we need to understand where dishwashers have come from and how they ended up in the foodservice industry. The first machine that could be labeled as a dishwashing machine was invented back in 1850 by Joel Houghton and it looked like a primitive washing machine without a spin. It was a hand powered dishwashing system in which dishes would pass through soapy water, rinse water and a final chaser of hot water.<n><n>We can look back to a time when we didn’t depend on dishwashing machines to do our dishes. Nowadays it’s very common to see full sized dishwashing units within most kitchens. It is no longer seen as a luxury to have a dishwashering unit but more than anything a vital need for anyone to actually do their dishes. Imagine having to go around and scrape your plates off by hand and wash and dry them all by hand. Now that might sound rather easy to most of you. Imagine doing that after working a 10 hour shift. Having to do that just might be worse than the full 10h shift. However, the reality is that was very much the case until dishwashers were invented. There was also a lot of demand for dishwashers as well. Dishwashers were in huge demand in hotels and large households. The first commercial dish washing machine was invented in 1856 by the famous Josephine Garis Cochrane.<n><n>Josephine was fed up with getting her expensive heirloom china broken by the workers she hired. With them sloppy cleaning and poorly stacking. After several attempts at building her own dishwashing unit she successfully invented one

If anyone can help it will be appreciated.<n><n>I understand `Python and SQL` well.<n><n>https://www.hirevue.com/skills/python<n><n>\strong{Thank You.}<n><n>Comment: Welcome to Stack Overflow. Please don't put multiple unrelated questions together.<n><n>Answer: The hirevue quiz is a bit of a random selection of questions and it is very important not to spend too much time on the quiz (it is just a screening test, nothing more), but it can get your skills in the area tested. You can learn from it and get an idea on where to focus for your interviews on a given company / role.<n><n>The hirevue quiz has about 15 to 20 questions on Python and one of the questions is related to python 3 syntax on a for loop and a couple have questions on python strings. There are also some questions on python lambda and python builtin functions. If you understand `Python`, you should be able to clear that part well.<n><n>I suggest that to prepare for interviews on python, you should learn the OOPS features of python in depth. You can use the python [OOPS guide](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) or any other tutorial. It will help you prepare for data structure questions that are commonly asked in python interviews. I suggest that you review the python [list comprehension](https://realpythoncourse.com/lesson/list-comprehensions-cheat-sheet/) tutorial as well.<n><n>After this, you should practice questions on python data structures that focus on coding. I suggest that you do [10 Days of Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) on Hackerrank as well as the [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) and [Real Python](

The home costs $10,000,000. It has 5 bathrooms, 10 windows, a tennis court, and a 2000 square meter garden. Ann had a decorator come in and completely redesign the home to her style. The decoration cost an extra $5,000, and that included 2 new large windows and a new tennis court. The home was originally white and Ann decided to make it red. She had to buy new paint. The garden was planted with flowers and trees. The flowers cost $14,000 and the trees cost 500x that amount. The total land area was 2000.0 sqm. She hired a landscaping company to install the flowers and plants. She then bought 100 new towels for the bathrooms at a cost of $20 each. Ann loved the home but had one complaint: she was bored with the white walls. One wall was a dining area with very high ceilings and needed a special type of paint so it ended up costing $200 more. The house already had one garden. Each of the 5 bathrooms had previously had 100 towels and the house had 20 of the dining room-quality wall paint (the rest previously being normal paint).

The seats have a constant number between each one, so each row is filled from top to bottom by numbers. If 1st row is filled by [1,2,3,...30] then 2nd row is filled by [30,29,28,..3,2,1]. If you are seated in the 2nd row then you can easily count the 3rd row number. If you want to be seated in the the 2nd row (in the worst case), when you are sitting in the 6th row (because the 5th row will fill), you should know that the row is [1,2,...], i.e. 2 minutes before.  That is, you have to add the remaining time per each seat. So if you sit in the 1st row you should be there 20*1+20*5+20*9 = 60+100+180 = 340 minutes before the movie.<n><n><n>## Question1<n><n>Adam bought 3 kilogoms of nuts and <n>2.5 kilogmots of dried fruits. <n>One kilogram of nuts cost $12 <n>and <n>one kilogram of dried fruits cost $8 How much did his purchaces cost<n>"""<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>The objective is to calculate purchase value.<n><n>**Input:** Adam bought 3 kilogram of nuts and 6 kilogram of dried<n>durices at a store.

It is very likely that at some point in your life, or in the near future, you will find machine learning technology being very prevalent and useful in your everyday needs. The purpose of this assignment is to allow you to test and explore many machine learning models and gain a better understanding of these popular machine learning techniques. The code provided for you here is just a rough starting point for you to investigate and play around with. You are strongly encouraged to add to this assignment and use this project in any way you wish.<n><n>Machine learning has three approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning entails labeled data, unsupervised learning entails unlabelled data, while reinforcement learning involves training an agent with rewards. Some of the more popular algorithms for supervised learning are decision trees, k-means clustering, neural networks, or k-nearest neighbors.<n><n>In this repository you will be focusing on two main algorithms: a supervised learning method and an unsupervised learning method. In this exercise, you do not need to test the implementation of the algorithm(s), but instead focus on exploring the performance of the algorithm(s) and analyzing the results of your work.<n>###### The two algorithms for you to choose are listed below:<n>- K-Means Clustering<n>- Random Forest Regression<n><n>###### Supervised learning algorithm for the first test:<n>K-Means Clusters with different number of clusters.

There is no power reaching the light.  In other words, there is an open circuit.<n><n>An open circuit is a circuit that is broken.  What closes that circuit and energizing the light is the switch.<n><n>So, how could you get the light to turn on all the time without having to hold down the switch?  We must replace the switch with a component that does not have to be held down for a light bulb to stay on, and that is a resistor.<n><n>A resistor resists the flow of electricity.  In this context, we are resisting the flow of electricity from the battery to the light bulb, so that, when the switch is turned off, an open circuit will no longer result due to the power being dissipated through the resistor.<n><n>Answer: B<n><n>-There are three main components to a computer network: a router, a hub, and a client.<n><n>Computer networks are made up of devices of different types called nodes (computers, printers, cameras and any other device with network capabilities). These devices are connected by wires, cables, or Wi-Fi depending on their design.<n><n>The two main types of networks are LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network). LANs connect nodes within a limited area such as a home, office, school, or group of buildings. WANs connect nodes over larger distances, including between different cities, regions, countries, and even countries. WANs may also include LANs (called subnetworks).<n><n>Each node in the network must have its own unique address so that

The string itself will not be the same each time, so<n>#code needs to be robust to handle different input strings.<n><n>#You can start by using split(), which splits the input string up into pieces and returns them<n>#as a list. Next, you can use the frequency() method from itertools which counts how<n>#many things are in a given list and returns an object that can be transformed to a dictionary<n>#using the keys() method. You can use a loop to create this dictionary, which you can then<n>#print. Here is the code that I wrote to solve this exercise:<n><n>input_str = input("Enter a string: ")<n><n>frequency_dict = {}<n><n>for x in range(0, len(input_str)):<n>    temp = input_str[x]<n>    num = frequency(temp, input_str)<n>    frequency_dict.update({temp:[num]})<n><n>for x in frequency_dict.keys():<n>    print(x, ": ", frequency_dict[x])<n># --------------------------------------<n># Explanation of Code: Letter Frequency Exercise<n><n>def frequency(string, s):<n>return string.count(element)<n><n>frequency_dictionary = dict()<n><n>for char in string:<n>    #frequency = split("")<n>    frequency = split(string)<n>    if frequency not in frequency_letter :<n>        if frequency in frequency_letter : <n>            frequency_letter.append(frequency)<n><n>    letter_frequency = frequency[len("")]<n>    #letter_frequency = frequency.pop()<n>    <n>    <n>    #print(s, frequency)<n>    for count in letter_frequency:<n>        frequency_dictionary.update({"temp" : frequency})<n>    print(frequency_dictionary)<n><n><n># ------------------------<n>

The solution would come to you almost instantly with just 1 or 2 iterations.<n><n>But when I did some research I came to know that there are other, more efficient and less computational way than this.<n><n>But that wasn't in my area of research. So I thought of trying to learn one of the methods and try if I could come up with a solution in less computational cost and time.<n><n>First of all, I had to gather data about various methods which are used to tackle such problems. And that's where I come across Dynamic Programming. <n><n>Dynamic programming is a technique which is mainly used in solving problems which involve mathematical sub-problems.<n><n>Dynamic programming is based on the concept of diving the problem into smaller related sub-problems. And we try to solve those sub-problems which might again be converted into sub-problems and so on until we reach a problem of very small size which is easy to be solved.<n><n>I know this may make you a bit confused but trust me it's not that big deal. All you need is a little intuition and you are on. Let us get back to our problem.<n><n>**The Knapsack problem**<n><n>The knapsack problem is based on the greedy approach. The problem states that we are given a certain amount of money to spend and a set of goods and each item has a price. So, if we purchase all the goods, we will spend the given money. But we also need to spend the exact amount of money and purchase the maximum quantity of goods that we can.<n>

We're in this business to help people with technical and nontechnical assessments that we feel are good predictors of performance at work.<n><n>The next question is 'Why do assessments currently in use work so poorly?' We feel that it's not because the questions are not well-written or that they are biased; it's because the technology and statistical methods used to score them are flawed, so they don't improve with training.<n><n>'So if we understand what needs to be done, why are there so many poor assessments if they don't improve even with study?' The answer is that the question is very complex to solve, so most companies opt out of trying to do it themselves. Often, organizations that use assessments find that it's not even necessary -- they discover that the assessment of whether a person can do job X is not all that critical to making a hiring decision; they can make a hiring decision based only on resumes and job interviews.<n><n>If the company does decide to implement an assessment, the process is complicated. You have to find statistically valid, legally defensible questions that you don't want people to see beforehand. Then those questions need to be scored by having people rate them using statistics. After people are scored, you need to make sure that the scores don't correlate with protected characteristics (race, gender, etc.), you need to make sure the scores correlate with job performance, and you need to train the scorers so they become better at their job.<n><n>This process can be expensive and require a lot of time and effort if done the wrong way.

Choices: A: tiredness B: relief C: relaxation D: frustration E: exhilaration<n>Output: A<n><n>### Hint:<n>1. Take the input and parse it into the desired values (as a string, integers, or whatever else). Then format the output appropriately. You may need to convert floats to strings to do this. <n><n>2.  Write a method for this operation in the solution.js file like in the practice example.  It should look a lot like the `test` function in that example. <n><n>3.  Make sure to test your work in the `test.js` file.<n><n>### Bonus:<n><n>You could add some validation.  For instance, in the first problem you could validate that a weight is in the realm of possibility (e.g. a weight like 12.23 is not possible and should be rejected and give a helpful message).  However, I suggest that you do not put a whole bunch of validation in these first tasks.  You might not make it past stage 1 if it does not work.<n><n>### Submitting your work for Graded:<n><n>Submit a pull request through github.  <n><n>

There is no power reaching the light.  In other words, there is an open circuit.\n\nAn open circuit is a circuit that is broken.  What closes that circuit and energizing the light is the switch.\n\nSo, how could you get the light to turn on all the time without having to hold down the switch?  We must replace the switch with a component that does not have to be held down for a light bulb to stay on, and that is a resistor.\n\nA resistor resists the flow of electricity.  In this context, we are resisting the flow of electricity from the battery to the light bulb, so that, when the switch is turned off, an open circuit will no longer result due to the power being dissipated through the resistor.\n\nAnswer: B\n\n-There are three main components to a computer network: a router, a hub, and a client.\n\nComputer networks are made up of devices of different types called nodes (computers, printers, cameras and any other device with network capabilities). These devices are connected by wires, cables, or Wi-Fi depending on their design.\n\nThe two main types of networks are LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network). LANs connect nodes within a limited area such as a home, office, school, or group of buildings. WANs connect nodes over larger distances, including between different cities, regions, countries, and even countries.

Fixed mortgages require you to pay them to the end. Fixed mortgage payments remain unchanged over the life of the mortgage, but variable mortgage loans vary with interest rates. They increase or decrease as the market index changes, but for this you need to pay only the interest, which will be charged to the difference.

In this case, since there are only four values in this list, the median is the third number, 12. \n\nIf one function is given the list:\n```[\"What\", \"was\", \"the\", \"temperature\", \"when\", \"I\", \"started\", \"from\",\"home?\"]```\nThen it should return \"90\". \n\n### Challenge\n\nGiven the following questions and their lists of options, write a function that will answer these questions by returning an answer to the question given the list of possible answers. Use the question and answer pairs we have created as examples if they are incomplete or as needed. \n  + \n\n### Checklist\n\nPlease ensure that you have passed all the tests and check your code at least three times before submitting.\n\n**Additional Info**\n\nWe are using a version of this problem in practice interviews. It is also used in some coding competitions. If you pass a mock interview, please submit a link to your mock interview for documentation purposes only.\n\n## Instructor Notes and Examples\n\n**Instructor Notes**\n\nThis problem is a great way for students to start writing functions. You might have students create the questions and answers together and then give them to the student in the form of a list. This works particularly well to give small groups of students that need more help together.\nThis problem is very flexible for using in larger classes or labs. Try to take 15 minutes or so to have students discuss their problems in groups.\n\n**Code Examples**\n\nThe problem is a bit open ended, but there are some good code examples that students can start with. One good example is simply returning the middle number or index number. Example:\n\n```python\ndef get_list_middle_number", "answer": "A: pub"}

The solution would come to you almost instantly with just 1 or 2 iterations.\n\nBut when I did some research I came to know that there are other, more efficient and less computational way than this.\n\nBut that wasn't in my area of research. So I thought of trying to learn one of the methods and try if I could come up with a solution in less computational cost and time.\n\nFirst of all, I had to gather data about various methods which are used to tackle such problems. And that's where I come across Dynamic Programming. \n\nDynamic programming is a technique which is mainly used in solving problems which involve mathematical sub-problems.\n\nDynamic programming is based on the concept of diving the problem into smaller related sub-problems. And we try to solve those sub-problems which might again be converted into sub-problems and so on until we reach a problem of very small size which is easy to be solved.\n\nI know this may make you a bit confused but trust me it's not that big deal. All you need is a little intuition and you are on. Let us get back to our problem.\n\n**The Knapsack problem**\n\nThe knapsack problem is based on the greedy approach. The problem states that we are given a certain amount of money to spend and a set of goods and each item has a price. So, if we purchase all the goods, we will spend the given money. But we also need to spend the exact amount of money and purchase the maximum quantity of goods that we can.", "answer": "B: learn about"}

I looked inside the code, and there really is not much to help understand it though, since it uses `import` but there is not an `import` line.

I want to learn how to do it, so can someone please post an answer about how to go about solving these questions?\n\nComment: [Asking for tutorials is frowned upon](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/254424/is-it-okay-to-ask-for-tutorials-and-links-on-stackoverflow). If you can't answer the questions from what you already know (or what you found in your attempt to make an attempt), then you don't know how to read the documentation for your toolset.\n\nComment: Can you suggest some books, or resources I should read? I have never had a programming class!\n\nComment: If you've never had a programming class, then learning how to program will need to start with some very basic resources: learn the very basics of the language. Most languages will provide a tutorial somewhere on their website, or on their own documentation.\n\nAnswer: This is more a task than an algorithm problem. You need to do little research and practice to get familiar with the tools and be able to solve the problems. I am not going to tell you how to do it. You can read and research, ask another if you don't understand something. This is a good way to learn.\n\nOne hint for the 7th case, calculate everything possible from the problem statement.

In order to solve this question, we need a couple of additional pieces of information.\n\n1. How much money the person had to spend in total\n\n2. How much of that money was spent on nuts, and how much on dried fruit\n\nThe amount of money spent on nuts\n\nLet's assume that nuts cost three times what dried fruit costs.\nThat gives us the following equation:\n\n$m = 4k; m = 4k; kk = \u00bc. (the number of dried fruits k is equal to the number of nuts times 4, since you spend three times as much on nuts)\n\nPlugging those two equations into the statement, we have the following:\n\n$3k+3k = m 3m \u00be + \u00be = \u00be \u00b3 \u00bd \u00b2 4 3 4 1 = ; \u00bd = ; ; \u00bc = 1= 56 4= 56 \u00bc = 56\n\nThe amount of the money spent on dried fruit\n(Reminder: dried fruit is equal to half the amount of nuts you buy)\n\n$$k = \u00bcm$$\n\nPlugging nuts into the equation above, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\u00bc}{3}(3m) = \u00bcm$$ $$$$4 = 1m$$ $$$$\u00bc = 1m $$$$2 = 1m $$ m=4 \u00bc=4 $$$$=4 $$ $$ $$56\n$$\n\nAdding 56 and 56 together and noting that Adam spent 56 dollars on nuts and 56 dollars on fruit, we find that he paid **$112** dollars in total.\n\nInput: Johs goes to the gym **three times** a week.

We're in this business to help people with technical and nontechnical assessments that we feel are good predictors of performance at work.\n\nThe next question is 'Why do assessments currently in use work so poorly?' We feel that it's not because the questions are not well-written or that they are biased; it's because the technology and statistical methods used to score them are flawed, so they don't improve with training.\n\n'So if we understand what needs to be done, why are there so many poor assessments if they don't improve even with study?' The answer is that the question is very complex to solve, so most companies opt out of trying to do it themselves. Often, organizations that use assessments find that it's not even necessary -- they discover that the assessment of whether a person can do job X is not all that critical to making a hiring decision; they can make a hiring decision based only on resumes and job interviews.\n\nIf the company does decide to implement an assessment, the process is complicated. You have to find statistically valid, legally defensible questions that you don't want people to see beforehand. Then those questions need to be scored by having people rate them using statistics. After people are scored, you need to make sure that the scores don't correlate with protected characteristics (race, gender, etc.), you need to make sure the scores correlate with job performance, and you need to train the scorers so they become better at their job.\n\nThis process can be expensive and require a lot of time and effort if done the wrong way.

When the dog took off its hat, only 2 bags of dog food fell out. What would the shopkeeper have given the dog if the dog had brought 5 bags of dog food?<n>A. $ 1<n>B. $10<n>C. $14<n>D. $22<n>E. $29<n>Answer: The first number in your answer has to match the price of the dog food, so that rules out E and A.<n>The second number in your answer has a 2 in front of it, which means your final answer will be 2 times more than the first number. The only way this works is if second number is 49. This leaves us with two options:<n>A answer can't be right here, because the answer in the problem has to be more than the price of 6 bags of food<n>B answer is the correct answer.<n>#Question 2:<n>#If you add 100 to your original number, and double your result, how many times does this happen?<n>A. 23<n>B. 24<n>C. 26<n>D. 27<n>E. 28<n>Answer: This is a bit more of a tricky question, but you do a lot of the work for yourself.<n>The "you add 100" part is key here; your answer has to be a number that increases by 100 every time.

The map is a data structure that maps keys mapped to values defined in one type to another type. The keys are objects that can be compared with equality operators ==,!=. The values are of type T so that key.eq(key1)==key.eq(key2) returns the same state as key==key1 and key==key2.  The map stores the pairs (key, value) such that each key has at most one corresponding value.

With help from his roommate Alex, he launched a tech company called Y2K Solutions, which guaranteed to solve the problems of the so-called Y2K bug by 2000. The company was hugely successful, earning $400 million in its first year. The Y2K bug (also known as the “millennium bug”) was a problem with the coding behind computer clocks. Many computers were programmed to assume that years would start in 1900 and run until 1999. By 1999, it seemed likely that many computer systems would fail on New Year's Day 2000, the year computers would enter the “Year 2000.” Jack and Alex realized that if they could make millions solving this one bug, they could make even more solving all the other bugs that computer programmers had failed to anticipate. Alex was a computer software engineer, so he worked on creating and selling software to fix common computer bugs. Jack, who studied computer science, became an evangelist spreading the Y2K gospel to worried business owners who believed their expensive computing equipment was about to fail. Thanks to their hard work, Jack and Alex became billionaires and are still alive and well today, living in San Francisco, a city where they have donated generously to charitable causes.<n><n>Output: 266,932,168,909<n><n>Input:  If you wanted to take a trip to New York City, you would fly 4,000 miles with a flight direction of 090.

Let's consider the two numbers to the right of the `M` in the two expressions as `x` and `y` here, and we know that `x + y = M - 1` and `x - y = Z`. This should let us quickly set up equations `y = 66 - x` and `x - 5y = 10`. We can isolate `x` in the first equation:<n><n>```<n>5y = 66  - x<n>x = 66 + 5y<n>```<n><n>Using the second equation and `x=66+5y` we get:<n><n>```<n>x + y = M-1<n>5y - 10 = Z<n>4y = 36 + 10 = 46<n>y = 46/4 = 11.5<n>x = 67.5<n>```<n><n>For question `3` we are told that he worked the same hours each day.

How many pennies does Caleb have?<n>This multiple-choice question requires that the student knows about adding and subtracting fractions, as well as performing multiplication and division with money. As such, these are some of the topics that a student should have studied in math class.<n><n>This question would typically have three answer choices, one correct and two incorrect. <n><n>Let's take a look at an example:<n><n>Answer A 51 Answer B 29 Answer C 26 Answer D 53<n>Explanation: There are 57 coins and 39 more nickel than dimes. There are 68 nickel since there are 57 coiins,and 39 nickel means 39/39 more coins.  There is a total of 5 coins, which is 32, since 3 x 10 is 30, and 5 x 2 is 10. 57 + 61 = 5.69, when converted into cents. So, there are 69 cents. There are 43 dimes, so there are 69 - 43 = 26 pennies. In conclusion, C is correct. So, 26 is the correct answer to this multiple-choice question. You can use the multiple-choice question as a tool for assessing the knowledge of your students in a variety of contexts, including exams, standardized tests, and job interviews.<n><n>Question 2: Diane is putting away potted flowers.

First we have to check whether A OR (B AND x) is true by solving the previous expression. A True OR (B AND x), here B is false so if A is true the expression will be true. So we can conclude that A OR (B and x) can be True only if A is True, therefore we can eliminate two options A and C from the given options so we end up with only the option (B and x). Now we have to check what should (B and x) will be. Here x is false as (A AND B ) are false, so B should always be false, so (B and x) becomes True. So the expression can be broken into this following steps:<n><n>First Check whether A OR (B and ) will be true.<n><n>Second, Check for (B and ) will always be true.<n><n>Output explanation: The solution can be broken into following steps:<n>First check for the expression “A OR TRUE”. Here A is a true statement, therefore the expression “A OR True” is also true, so the statement can be evaluated to true.<n>Output explanation: The statement can be evaluated to True simply as you can see below:<n><n>First check for the statement “A OR  C”. Here A is a false statement therefore the first statement is false, but the second statement (C) is true, so the statement “A OR C” becomes true here.<n><n>###Instruction:Answer the following question with the given options and rules.

By how many times did the number decrease?<n>Output: 88 times, because 350 is 88 divided by 4, and since 342 is the answer, 342 is 350 divided by 10. To get to the answer, you must subtract 10 from 350 (340) and 88 more times. This would get you 100 more times, 30 times more and -10 times (340 - 360 + 10), so 340 - 88 = 252 is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:Bob needs to put together 466 nuts in the machine.

If he would spend 140,000 ms on each nut but was only given 140,500 ms we would get 140,250 ms. If 140,325 seconds is given we would have just 14

An inquiry at the local airport revealed that the least expensive day of the week for such travel is Tuesday, when the weekly fare is $15 cheaper than all the other weekdays. However, in any given week there may be as many as three Tuesdays. The plumbers will probably save travel expense by scheduling the meeting for the Tuesday of a 3-day weekend, not necessarily the last Tuesday of the month, but they must select that Tuesday at least three weeks in advance. The meeting must be held on a Tuesday for which fares are posted to begin sale on a Wednesday that is at least two weeks before, and not later than three weeks before, the meeting date. The first Wednesday of the month will thus begin a sequence of any 1, 2, or even 3 eligible Tuesdays. To select the cheapest travel week, the plumbers must pick out the Tuesday which is closest to a date that is both a Wednesday of a period beginning at least two weeks before the meeting and not later than three Wednesdays before the meeting. What is the earliest date they can select for the meeting?<n>Output: <n>the 2

How did you arrive at your answer and why is it wrong?<n><n>Comment: Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem.<n><n>Answer: Based on the format of the question and the output you have provided, your program needs a nested loop.<n><n>Since you're asking the user to provide one or more answers, a nested loop will ask a question, store the response, and ask the same question again to allow for multiple inputs.<n><n>Also, since you want to store the user's responses in a list instead of just printing them after getting a response, your program should have a separate list. You can access that list multiple times to ask the same question and to print the list and add additional responses.<n><n>Comment: I don't know if you're familiar with recursion but a solution like this would be a recursion nightmare. You'd need several recursive functions, one controlling the outermost loop that checks if the current response isn't None and calls a lower recursetive function, passing it True if the question is asked again and False if not... that lower recursive function would then need to check if the response is None, which can only be determined by calling a recursive function on the next question.<n><n>Comment: The number of responses will limit the depth at which you can recurse.<n><n>Comment: Recursive nested loops would work but are a pain. Instead take the input, add

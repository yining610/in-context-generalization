Choices:  In many cases, a severe headache is caused by stress and/or exhaustion, and the best treatment is to simply stop what you're doing, rest for a while, then take it easy for the rest of the day. Anything that will help you relax and forget about the headache will work, whether it's hot coffee or tea, a warm bath, a nap, listening to soothing music, or just watching television. In most cases, a headache will heal itself in a relatively short time. The best way to get rid of a headache is with aspirin.

Ibuprofen, naproxen, and Tylenol are not nearly as effective at relieving a headache. It could be that you are simply overdue for a checkup.

If you never have headaches or experience any unusual side effects, it's unlikely that a headache is a sign of a more serious condition.

She wants to open her own clinic and her mother gave her a budget of two hundred thousand dollars to furnish it.  Write a Python program that computes and produces a report on how she can best spend her budget on medical equipment and supplies based on your friend\u2019s needs.  \n\nFor instance, if she has to spend one hundred thousand dollars on supplies and one hundred thousand dollars on medical equipment, make sure that the clinic has at least one fax machine, one x-ray machine, one EEG machine, one microscope, and seven computers.  \n\n**Hint:**  She can\u2019t spend 120 percent of her budget!\n\nIf you would like to know what your medical supplies budget is, find the value of 100 % of Sally's budget first. Then take 90 % of that value and subtract it from the original value.  \n\nIf you would know what the value of the medical equipment budget is, find 20 % of Sally\u2019s budget first. After that, subtract 4 % of the original value from this new value.  \n\nThen use if/elif/else statements to compute the total cost of these machines and supplies required by your friend Sally.\n\n-The name of the clinic is Herman Medical Clinic\n-If required, a fax machine costs 10,000 dollars\n-If required, an EEG machine cost 15,000 dollars, an x-ray machine cost 12,000 dollars and a microscope costs 4,000 dollars.  \n\n-She needs at least one computer, at least one EEG machine and at least one fax machines, no computers at all, no microscopes and only one x-ray machine.\n\nHint: \nThe cost of a PC is $1,300.00\n\nTo help you get started, here are some ideas for how to structure your program:\n\n-Keep track of values and amounts as they come in but don\u2019t go overboard with how much you want to store\n-Create some variables and functions to help with the computation process", "answer": "C: jar"}

What is the probability of being able to pick one marble out of the bag at random and it being red? \nOutput: 0\n\nThe number '0' means that the probability of picking a red marble out of the random bag is 0% or no chance of occurring. The reason why the answer is zero is because that means there is one colored marbles in the bag and there is 0% chance of being able to pick that colored marble out. If the probability of picking red, green, or blue marbles were equal, the probability of picking each numbered marble would be 1/3 of 30 percent or 1/3 of.3 which is the same as.093. But because there is no '0'.3 of either numbered marble, none of the odds increase. Therefore, the probability is 0/3.", "answer": "B: nodding"}

He sees the cops approaching and begins his run.  He runs at a higher speed, but eventually falls to the ground.  Two law enforcement officers arrive at the scene and arrest Sammy for escaping from the police car and for stealing from the store.  He is sentenced to 10 years in prison.\nAfter escaping from the police car, Sammy runs off to the desert.  He finds a train that is hauling a bunch of people over a bridge.  A train guard throws a box of water over the bridge and stops the train as it moves over.  Sammy runs up the train, climbs onto the box, and takes off running.  He sees the river below and starts swimming.  But as he gets close to the river, an older man who is trying to help Sammy finds out that Sammy stole the water from the box; the older man turns and runs away.  Next time, Sammy would save the old man.  So he swims over to the boat that is racing along the train yard.  Again he throws a watermelon at the guard rail to stop the train.  One of the guards fires his machine gun at him through the window as Sammy makes his way along the train yards.  Once the train moves, he takes off running through the desert toward his friend, Charlie.

The same numbers are in all of the sets, but how many people are in the set with the most hands?\nOutput: 1 person with 19 pairs of hands, 1 person with 19 sets of hands, 1 person in each set with 20 hands\nSo 20 = 5 * 1 = 5 * 1 = 20 * 5 = 60 * 5 = 60 * 1,600 = 40,000\nSo the final answer of 60 + 400 = 60,000\n20 = 1,600 x 20 * 1 = 60,000 x 5,000 x 1 = 60,000\nSo 60,000 + 400 = 60,002 = 60,002\n60,000 + 4,000 = 60,002 divided by 4 = 60,000 x 4 = 60,000 divided by 4 = 60 minutes per person divided by 4 + 60 minutes = 60 minutes per couple\nSo 60 minutes per person divided with 4 divided by 4 divided by 4 = 60 Minutes = 20 minutes per couple divided by 4\nSo 1,600 = 60 * 60 = 60 minutes or 25 = 1.8 hours per couple divided by 4 = 1.8 hours divided by 30 = 30 minutes per person at 1 hour per couple divided by 30\nSo 1,600 ^ 30 = 1.8 hours total = 1.8 hours by 30 minutes\nSo 1 hour by 45 minutes = 30 minutes per person divided by 30 = 30 by 45 minutes divided by 30 minutes\nSo 30 minutes per person divided \u00d7 30 by 30 = 30 Hours Per Person divided by 3 = 3.5 Hours Per Couple divided by 3 = 3 hours per couple\nSo 1 hour divided by 45 minutes divided by 45 minutes = 30\nSo 1 hour divided \u00d7 45 by 45 minutes divided by 1 = 4.5 Hours divided by 45 minutes = 25.5 hours divided by 45\nSo", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

However, they will need to eat in the following places:  - a noodle stand on the way to the Beijing Temple - a hot pot place on the way to the Daqing Temple - a shawarma place with rice and beans on the way to the Nanjing temple - a sushi place on the way to Qingdao - an asahi place on the way to Shanghai - a beer garden near the presidential residence - and finally, an asahi place near the presidential residence while on the trip there.  How much money will the president lose per day eating these places?  Output: Assuming one meal per meal costs 10,000 yen, the per-day loss will be 6,000 yen for lunch, 10,000 yen for the shawarma, 10,000 yen per meal for the beer, 10,000 yen one meal in Qingdao, and 16,000 yen for lunch and dinner in the Beijing restaurant.\nIn total, the per-day average loss for lunch will be 16,000 yen, and the total per day average loss will be 24,000 yen if all 3 meals are eaten at the same restaurant.\nSo the total per day loss is 24,000 yen ($215 US) per day; more specifically $215/24=<$9 per day >\nSo the final answer on the per day loss is $9/day < < $9/day = <$3 per day >\nSo that's 24,000 yen a day\nSo the final answer of $3.08/day < $3/day < $3.08/Day = <$3.08/day = $3.08/Per day\nSo the total loss of $108/day < $108/day < ($108+108+108)% = $108 per day\n\nInput: The new CEO wants to hire a salesperson to increase the number of sales at his office sales department by two percent or an equivalent increase.

EPA also approved the discharge of 2.65 million gallons of toxic waste, including 11 different types of carcinogenic heavy metals in 1.8 million gallons of wastewater. What are the implications of this EPA decision?\nOutput: If 1.18 billion gallons is not enough to pollute a waterway at all, then why does the EPA require 2.65 million gallons as a maximum discharge from the nuclear power plant?\nIf we compare the amount of toxic waste that could be released into the Grand Canyon to the amount of radioactive decay waste that could be released under the same conditions, we see that the Grand Canyon has nearly three times more radioactive decay waste than the radioactive waste from the Maricopa Nuclear Power Plant.\nAssuming the U.S. Government's recommendation for radioactive waste from the Marialopa Nuclear Power Plants is to make a total of 30 gallons of toxic waste per year, this has the effect of more radioactive decay waste being released into the Grand Canyon each day than would be released during any year in the 100 years previously determined from the nuclear waste from the Maricona Nuclear Power Plants.\nWe are now living in a country (which we claim our government cares about) where it seems that our government is more concerned about how much waste disposal can take place in the Grand Canyon rather than how much waste can be released into a waterway that is already tainted.

If there are more Dobermans than Neutered Dobermans in any one litter, the total dog mix cannot be less than 28 percent Dobermans. What should be the total number of neutered Dobermans in that litter?\nInput: There are 10 Dobermans in the litter. Let x be the number of Neutered Doberman puppies, and let y be the number of the litter which has three Doberman puppies. Then if x is 10 and y is 3, the total number of Doberman pups in that litter is n/3 less than 12, so that n = y/3. So n = n/3, so n = 5/(n/3) which is equal to n/2 less than 30 pieces. The total size of n/2 less than 60 is 56 pieces. Add 30 pieces to that for a total of 56 pieces\nso the total size of n/3 less than 60 is 56\nInput: In this case, the size difference in pieces is greater than the total number of Neutered and Un neutered Dobermans, so the total is 51.9 pieces (n/3 less than 60).\nInput: Though there are 10 neutered and 10 neutered Dobermans but four females and four males, the total Doberman's must be 20 since there are two males and two females. So add 20 pieces for n (number of neutered and neutered but no females) to get the total number of neutred Dobermans: 21, or 20 minus n\nInput: In this instance, a total of 17 pieces is required to be exact since there are no males but 3 females. So the total number of neutrals is 20 pieces, or 20 minus n/2 less than 50 pieces.

Mary will then turn and run 10 x 50 = 200 meters.  Mary will then run 100 x 60 = 250 kilometers.  Mary will then finish off by running 50 x 35 = 300 kilometers.  How much time and how much money will it take to complete all 50 kilometers?\nOutput: Mary will run 100 x 50 = 250 meters = 5 hours.  She will then spend 3 hours running 50 x 35 = 150 kilometers = $50.05.  She will then run 10 more hours to complete the 300 kilometers = $160.05.\nThe total will be $160.05 (5+50*50)=$160\nSo the final answers is $160.05 * $5= $160\nWhich shows that you need 20 minutes to complete 15 kilometers so that you earn $20 for completing all 30 kilometers\nAnd 30 minutes for completing 5 kilometers so that you earn 60 minutes\nNow you can easily find $2000 per month working\nSo you get $2000 + 2 cents from each km.\nSo it will be $5000 per month working\nSo it will be 10 days per month to earn $5000\nWhich shows you need 10 minutes per 1 km.\nSo you earn $20 in an hour\nWhich shows you need 15 minutes per 1 km. So you earn $40 in an hour\nAnd 15 minutes per 1 km = 3 hours and 35 minutes\nSo you earn $60 per 1 minute\nSo its 5 days per month to earn at least $40 in 30 minutes\nSo the total amount is $65\nSo the final answer was $65\n\nInput: The two new patients are being admitted in 10 minutes.

{"text": "A: A B: A C: A D: B\n\nInput: The sun is shining on the water. What does that give us?\nOutput: At least twice as light on the water as the sun\nSo the sun does about three times as much sunlight as the sun\nSo we have 3*3 x 3 = 60 x 3 in the sun\nSo the total light is at least 60*3 x 3 = 180*3 x 3 in the sun.\nSo the total sunlight in the sun in one hour is 180*3 x 3 = 510*3 x 3 in one hour\nSo the total sunlight under a building is an astonishing 510*3 x 3 = 2420*3 x 3 in an hour\nSo the total solar radiation in an hour under a building is 2420*3 x 1 = 510*3 x 1 in an hour\nSo we get 2480*3 x 1 = 5020*3 x 1 in one hour\nSo there is a lot of sunlight under a building, but the amount of sunlight on the water is greater than on the land. We must think of this as a mirror-reflection problem. To solve for the reflection coefficient in the reflector, we use the following rule:\nR - C = 2 * 6* 6 * 6 = 7.4 * 6\nThus we have 3*3 / 3*3 * 3 = 5.7 * 6 * 6 = 28.8 * 6 * 6\nThus we end up with 57*6 * 6 = 140*13 = 7040*13 x 8\nThus we get 7040 x 8 = 12120 x 8 in an hour\nSo as mentioned, the total sunlight on the water is 60*6 x 12120 * 8 = 72*12120 x 8 in an hr\nSo since we had a lot of sunlight already, the amount of sunlight on earth is 7540 * 6 x 24120 * 8 = 15080 * 1672 x 2480\nSo we get 15080 x 1672 x 2480 * 8 in one day\nSo there is at least 15 * 15080 x 1672 * 2480 * 8 in an hr\nso the total sunlight in earth in one day is 15640 * 15 / 2480 * 8 in a day\nSo we have 15640 x 1672 x 2460 x 8 in one day\nso the total sunlight on earth in one hour is 48400 * 1672 * 9640 in a day\nSo the total sunlight on", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

They had no money.  In a three hour week, A would work 2 calls and B would work 1 call, each worth 4 sales:  8 sales per week = 2 calls / week = 8 sales each week = 2 sales = 1 sale = 2 weeks = 8 sales = 1 sale = 7 sales = 7 sales in a year = 8 sales\nOutput: A is a millionaire with money.

Once he managed to get out of the wave's reach, he was able to get back into the water.  What did he do once he got back to the surface and realized that the wave was coming again?\nOutput: The man who was able to get out 10 minutes before the wave hit was able to get back in the water 30 minutes after the wave was receding.  The man who was able only to get back in the waves after 30 minutes was not able to get back in before the waves receded.  The wave that hit at the beginning of the storm was not as severe as the wave at the end of the storm.  The wave at the beginning of the wave was a third as big as the wave at the latter part of the storm.\nSo after getting back in the water, he was able to swim about 30 minutes, back and forth from the deep end of the lake, to the shallow end of the lake, back and forth from his boat, back and forth from shore to shore and back and forth again from his boat to shore.  At the end of the 30 minutes, he managed to get back through the wave's reach.  The wave he swam under was 1/3 the size of the wave he swam under at the beginning.  The wave he escaped from was also 1/3 the size.  Based on the information of his story, we would say it was the water in 5 feet depth\nIf he could swim only 2 minutes (swim back and forth for 10 minutes each way) then he would have to swim 3 times as far and that makes the distance 30 times as big.  Thus his distance to cover was 30 times as far.\nBut then the wave that hit at the end of the wave was even larger than the one he swam out of when the wave finally receded.  We would say his total distance to cover was 7*30*3 = 140", "answer": "B: fragile"}

There is 4/16 = ## x## divided by 2/16, and since 8/16*24/32 = 17/32*32, we get 5/32 times 2/32. This gives us the total volume of helium in the airbag of 2.5*0.225^-6 = 2.5*1/5.0^-6 = 3.25^-6.5 or the total volume of helium inside the bag = 3.25^+12.5 = 10^-2^-6.5\nInput:  If the pressure in an ordinary air bubble in a vacuum = 0 and there is helium gas inside the bubble, then how much volume of helium can the vacuum expand?\nOutput: There must be a volume of helium inside the air bubble since the pressure (x) in the bubble is zero. Therefore, we need x^2 + y^2 = 2**2=2**2+3**2=2**5^-5x^2+3*5*6=9**2^-6\nThe total volume of helium inside a bubble divided by zero times zero equals 9, so we need x^2 - y^2 = ##x## + ##y##+ ##x## - ##y## = ##x##+ ##y##\nSince 2**2", "answer": "D: electric refrigerator"}

Let Z be the position in the graph that Z gets called.\nSuppose that in 100 games with only one call per game, Z gets called 9 times.  In those 9 calls, how sure do you feel that someone will pick Z?\nOutput: 10.5, 10 times\nLet's say that in 100 games with a call every game, the total number of calls is 50 times, so L is 10 times and we have an 87% chance that some player will pick Z\nWhich of the following statements about games with 1 call each game are more likely than others? =1-9 X 50 X 10.5 -9 X 50 X 25 is likely, or =10 X 50 X 50 X 9 is less likely or =9 X 3 X 25 is very likely or =10 X 25 X 9 is very unlikely\nSo the final answer for X is: 9\n\nInput: John calls in an emergency from a pay phone: \"I have a car accident on Route 1 North.\" He says: \"I was just behind a red car that was stuck in the dirt, but I could see that the car in front of me wasn't moving.\" What is the best course of action?\nOutput: John knows that the car is stuck in the dirt, so he assumes that the person in front of him (in his car) is disabled or dead, but can't be certain until it's too late. So his only option is to call the police and tell them he is in a crash. This is the correct choice. John is safer by calling and letting them know he is not at fault for the accident, and no one will get hurt, and he can keep driving safely.\nSince John knew about the accident by seeing with his eye, he correctly guesses that the car that is out of position is disabled or disabled. He is also safer since the police will check it out and see if it's someone else's fault in the case it isn't his mistake. This is the answer.\n\nInput: At first the man and the woman wanted to play cribbage, but the woman said she was having problems sitting still.

If you can guess both board states within a turn, it is worth 50 pts\nOutput: What is the name of the game and should we play it on this board? You cannot guess which board state you are in, only what your next step is.  If you are in a position to be able to guess other board states before you get there (i.e. do not have to take your next turn) you will score 50 points.\nWhen you guess other board states, your opponent can play a move to make you guess his board state. If your guess is wrong, your score is subtracted from your opponent's score.\nExample: Your opponent guesses e.g. \"red\", you guess e.g. \"black\". He plays a move for his move. You guess \"blue\", he guesses \"white\". If you guess \"red\", his score decreases by 20, and his score is -40, and you score 20, and -40 = -35, therefore you win by 2.  If his \"joker\" shot is a \"Black Bolt\", your score is subtracted = +5, +5 = 10.  Therefore you won by 10, which adds to 25, which adds to 50.

She breaks his arm by slamming it several times. How much money would she have to pay for each item of his broken arm?\nOutput: Her boyfriend is left with a broken arm for three days total, so he can spend only 8*3 = 32 hours working for her.\nA would be 1/3 of the $1,000 and B would be 1/3 and C is still 1/3.\nThe total price paid for A was only $25, B was $60, C was $10. So the final total paid for A was $25/2 = $25 dollars.\nFor the second time that day, her boyfriend breaks his arm. On her third day, he is left with a broken leg and a broken arm. He spends only 4 hours total working for her.\nSo the total amount paid for A is 3*3=9.\nThe total amount paid for B is 9*2 = 16.\nSo the final total paid for B was $46 dollars.\nFor the third time, on the third day, he is found in a field with both legs broken. He was left with no money.\nSo this would be an exact $46 dollar split. Even for the time she spends working, she would make less money at a job that pays $1,000.\nThis is also only an exact $46 split because he is broken on his third day. If he was broken on day one, she would make more than a $5 per hour working.\nSo this would still be an $46 split. For each item of breaking her boyfriend's arm, his price would be slightly higher than hers. Even if he makes less in pay per hour, she would easily make $5 per hour or more just based on the time she spends working.\nWhich one would you take?\n\nInput: The teacher asked the class to take", "answer": "C: computer"}

John put 1,000 in the refrigerator and 4,000 in the refrigerator. What is the amount of refrigerated eggs that are left? Why?\nOutput: 1,000*2 = 48,000 eggs\nSince John puts 4,000 eggs inside 30 pieces of ice cream, he has 48,000,48,000,48,0000 egg pieces inside of an ice cream sandwich.\nSince Kate puts 3 pieces in each ice cream sandwich, the same number is now inside each ice cream sandwich twice.

What is the number of chicken parts after 5,000 yards? How many parts does the acre contain then?\nOutput: 3 chicken parts / 2,000 + 3 chicken parts = 3 pieces +3 pieces\nSince the chicken is 3*2,3*3, the chicken parts remain the same = 3*3 = 3 pieces\nSo the final total chickens parts are = 3*3 = 1 piece of chicken\n\nInput: It takes 5,000 bananas to make 10 bananas.

Jane finds no proof that it was ever there. What could Jane have done to help her find it?\nOutput: The missing purse was in Jane's handbag. If she dropped it, it left with her and was missing when she found it.\nIf she had gone out to fetch it, she would have found no traces of it at all.\nThus, it was gone before Jane had the chance to lose it. In the end, it's unlikely that her purse was still there at the time she left.\nIn a similar situation, Jane found something else on her counter which was also gone when she came back in.\nThus, she had nothing in her handbag which was hers when she left.

Output: At noon, the baseball team practiced four hours and the football practiced four hours.  What percentage of the team practiced four hours each day?  How long did the basketball practice each day?  How many hours did the baseball team practice?\nSince the baseball team practiced four times as much, it means that the baseball team practiced 8x*4 = 483 more time than the football team did.\nThe football team practiced 4x*4 = 584 more time than the baseball team did.\nThe team practiced 6x*4 = 756 more time than the team practiced.\nSo the total baseball practice was 5X*4 = 1248 more than the basketball team practiced and 9X*4 = 2000 more than the basketball team did.\nSo the basketball team practiced less than the baseball team did\nBecause the baseball team practiced more, they beat the football team by a percentage of 12/(9*4)/48 = 12+12/48.\nSo the final score was 7% + 2% = 12% + 12% = 16%.\nSo the final answer was 16%\n\nInput: On Tuesday, John has a haircut at 4 pm and Mark has one at 12 pm.

Let's assume that there are 2,700,000 people running. Then how many times can they sprint a mile? Can they do it without breaking a sweat?\nIf they can run one mile with no breaks and only breaking a sweat 9 times, multiply that figure by.9 = 9 sprints per mile\nSince the sprint time for an average person is only 1.06 seconds, multiplying by 9 will give us a sprinting time of 1.46 seconds\nSo the sprinting time for a person is 1.46* 1.06* (1.06-9)=1.58 seconds\nThis sprinting time is twice average time, ie half of sprinting times\nSo it is twice as fast as average pace\n\nInput: Bob's son is not his son.

On Sunday afternoon he passes a house with seven identical identical cars parked in a row. Each car has a distinct number.  On Monday, the house has 10 identical cars because there are no duplicates (10) parked in the row.  On Tuesday, the house has 11 identical cars. On Wednesday, the house has 14 identical cars.  On Thursday the car is missing. What is the man's name?\nOutput: The number of cars in Sunday's row is 9... the number of cars in Tuesday's row is 14... the number in 2013 is 14.  The number of cars on Wednesday is 10... the number on Thursday is 2... and the number of cars on Friday is 13.  So the man has traveled by train (or elevator) every day for 13 consecutive days.  What was the time spent each day?  If it is 18 hours, the man will spend 2200 hours there.  If only one of the cars is missing on Friday or Saturday, then the man is able to get to his home town by train using the remaining car.  What am I missing?  If the man takes the train for 9 straight hours Monday and Tuesday, and then he goes home by train for 11 straight hours Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, then he has traveled by plane (or train) for 1,960 hours. What number of planes or trains would he have to travel using only one train to reach his home town?  If the man travels by plane each day for eight straight hours over the first eight days, he will travel 1,320, and then over the last 12 days he will travel 1240 hours. Why?  If we start the calculation when the train is still traveling, it takes 25 days and 20 hours to get back by plane. If we start the calculation from the hour that it takes to get from his house to the train station, it takes 21 days and 14 hours to return by plane. So there are 36,000 hours that were spent sitting on a train over the first 25 days and 20 hours that would be wasted to get back home by plane using only one train on Friday or Saturday.  In other words, the time spent each day to get from the house to the train station is: 36,000 x 1,040 = 36,", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}

Let x = 3/2*3 = <<3*3=3>>3 hours a week for grooming\nSince hair is detachable, hair gets tangled easily, he should do a daily maintenance in which he brushes his hair daily to remove the tangles\nSince the grooming takes 30 minutes, he is injury-prone so it seems like tardiness B every fourth day.\nSince it takes 27 minutes for an animal to groom, you would also expect tardiness B on days 1 and 8.\nDogs groom their heads, but their grooming is often the last thing they do of the day.

The polls say that Bush is leading, but he is only up by a margin of 3 percent.  His opponent, Al Gore, has a 9-point lead.  How many polls have been wrong? What is Gore's margin of error?\nInput: If Bush has a 3% lead and Gore's margin of error is 3%, then Bush has a 95% chance of winning.  If both George W. Bush and Al Gore have 95% chances of winning, it is impossible for either one of them to lose the election.\nOutput: If there are 95 polls saying that George W. Bush leads in the race for President against Al Gore, and there are 95 polls saying George W. Bush leads with the margin of error for the polls divided by the total number of polls is equal to the average of these 95+1 polls, then it is 99.99% certain that George W. Bush will win the election.\n\nInput: You own a car dealership. An employee recently purchased a new white Lexus for $25,000. The average car sale is $37,000.

On Tuesday it was 52 degrees in Baltimore. Which is more warm? What is the current temperature outside in Baltimore?\nOutput: 52 degrees * 1.2 = <<52+1.2=90>>90 degrees\nThe temperature was actually 55 degrees outside in Baltimore when Sally was born.\nSo the final temperature outside is now 90 >> 87 = <<90 >> 87 degrees.\n\nInput: On Monday, Sally had 2 apples, 3 oranges and 2 bananas. On Tuesday, she had 5 apples, 3 oranges and 4 bananas. On how many days can Sally eat all her apples, oranges, and bananas?\nOutput: It depends on how many days she eats, on both the average size of the fruits and the fact that on days she only eats one fruit each, the volume of apples, oranges and bananas will decrease by the same amount as her daily intake.\nOutput: On a day when she eats only 1 peach, the average daily volume of apples, oranges, and banana is 1.4 times that of the one day she drinks a cup of coffee, and 3 times that of the other day. This means that on a Monday morning she will be able to eat and drink as much fruit as the average amount daily on Tuesday.\nSo Sally has eaten 3 apples = 3 + 3 * 2 = 9, oranges = 9 + 3 * 2 = 15 and bananas = 9 * 2 = 9.\nSo Sally is able to eat 9 apples, 15 oranges, 3 bananas = 9 x 365 = 5,636 days.\nSo a year of Sally eating 3 apples = 3 x 365 = 36,400 days.\nSo the final number is 36,400 days\n\nInput: On Tuesday, Sally eats 3 bananas. She does not eat any apple. On which days can Sally eat 3 bananas?\nOutput: On any given day, Sally can eat exactly 3/12 of the daily banana volume.\nSo Sally can eat 3/12 of a single banana = 3*0.12 = 3 bananas\nOn a day when she eats more than 3/12 of bananas, her volume of bananas decreases by the same amount as the average amount.\nSo Sally can only have a total banana volume = 3*0.36, or 3/12 * 0.36 = 3 bananas", "answer": "D: republican party"}

So you should answer the indirect question with a direct question or ask questions that are similar.  In this example, the indirect question is  What should you do if you drop the handle of your bicycle seat when you are on an empty road?    So when Ali drops the handle, he has dropped the handle of his bicycle seat.  But he also has his hand behind the bicycle seat and this hands behind the bicycle seat should also be a tool.\nThe third option is to hold on to the handle of the bicycle and instead of turning it, turn around and face the road so his arms are behind the bicycle seat.  The problem is that he has dropped a tool that should be used when he is biking on a empty road.  Instead of doing any of these, he would need an extension cord to tie to a tree and then turn around.

The Soviet Union had 11.2 Million, so it was necessary to divide them up. There were 7.5 Million Russians living in the USSR so it was necessary to give each of them three lines of people to count. Each Soviet citizen would be counted only once, thus each line of people would be represented as three groups of 10 people each.\n\nInput: Each person is given a line of people on a graph with a line drawn parallel to the center of that graph.  One point is the center of the graph.  The second line crosses the first line parallel to the first line.  If they cross both lines, they are a single person.  If they cross one only, they count as separate people (one-point data), and they are counted twice (two-point data).\n\nInput: What is the maximum distance between all the points on the graph?\nOutput: Each graph has a fixed number of nodes, so the maximum distance on a given graph can change, but always be less than the maximum distance between all points on the other graph.

How many eggs were in it when you washed it? How many eggs were it when you left it for a morning and then washed it? For how many mornings before you decided to wash it and did you wash it?\nOutput: 10 = 10^2/3 = 6/15\nSince the bowl had 9 eggs in it when I left it in the morning, I washed it when that was done. The wash was 2 days after that.  Also because the last day it was washed was 2 days ago, I left it for 1/2 hour on Thursday before that when I washed it by hand.

Let a be 3 boxes, b be 3 cans, c be 3 bags, d be 5 tops and e be 5 bags. To calculate the amount of dirt that has to be removed from our garage, first we divide b by 3: 3 + 3 = >>>3+3=16>>16>>16>>30.\nThen divide a by 10: 3 - 3 = <<3+3=10>>9.3 = <<10-3=12>>12.3 = <<10/3=1>>1.3 = <<3/3=1>>\nSo b/3 = <<b/3=10>>10.3 = <<10 - 3*3=12>>12\nSo a/3 = <<a/3=10>>11.3 = <<11 - 3*5=15>>15\nSo b/3 is >0 = <<ab/3=10>>7 + 7 + 7 = <<ab/3+10>13.5\nSo a/3 >=0 = <<ab/2>5>>5 + 6 + 6 = <<ab/2+10>9 >9.5\nSo a >=0 = 5 or more : 15 or more : 23\nSo b >=0 = 15 or more: 32 or more : 60\nSo a >=0 is more than 5: 60 or more : 75\nSo b >=0 is less than 5: 45 or fewer: 90 or fewer: 80\nSo b >=0 equals 5 or more: 80\nSo a >=0!= 5: 0\nSo a >=0 == 5: YES\nSo b >=0 == 5: NO\nSo a >=0 >=0 = 9: YES\nSo b is greater than 5: NO\nSo b is less than 5: YES\nSo a is < 5: YES\nSo is a >=0: YES\nSo a >0 : NO\nSo is a >= or < 5: YES YES YES\nSo is a = 0 or 1: YES YES YES YES YES YES\nSo a is >= 1 or greater or < 1", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}

Tom puts $100 from John and takes the money out of John's wallet and takes it to the office. John has $100. He puts $100 in his pocket, puts the rest of his money in his wallet, puts his change in the jar, puts the jar in his pocket and takes it for the office. If John puts the money in his pocket the $100 isn't his. If he puts his change in his pocket the $1 he put away isn't his money. The final answer is John has $100 divided into 24 pieces, $2 each piece.\nIf John adds $2 each to $100, his total money is $200. He takes $200. He puts $100 back in his pocket, puts $100 back in the jar, puts $100 in the jar, puts 10% in the jar. The jar is full by the time John fills it back up.

When you play on the cello, your bow is stationary and the strings move with the bow. Which is easier?\nOutput:  It is hard to think about your bow. It distracts you. You try to force it to stay still to focus on the note you are playing.  Also, playing on the cello is more precise because the bow is stationary.  This helps you get the notes more precisely because the distance between your fingers and the strings is small.  The violin is easier, though, because your fingers can reach out for more strings and because the strings are wider and thicker.  Playing on the cello is easier since most of it is in a fixed position.  It is also less precise since most of the strings don't move. In these ways, it is easier on the cello and in particular it's harder on your bow.

The time between first birth and second birth was two years.  Now, after two years, the first child is 22 and the second child is 19.  The couple has 10 children between the two babies, meaning that they raised 10 children using the same basic principles of birth control.  This couple continues to have 10 children over the next few years. Is this true?  Does this couple still have eight or nine children left? What is it like? What has changed? How many children at each birth?  Give a number between 0 and 10, where zero = No children and one = No babies.\nOutput: They are a happy couple. Their children are happy.  The couple did not breed and they did not have any more children at any given time.  Since the parents made no more children, their children are also without children.  They also raised not 10, but 16 children using the same basic methods of birth control.\nSo the number 16 - 8 + 11 = 32\nIn order to have 32 children, they would have to: do a double birth. Do a triple birth. Have another triple birth.  There were no children that are 16 at any given time in the course of their 14 children.  So the family has 32 children between two children.  It also has 32 children between the next two birth.  So it will have 48 children over the course of the 16 children.  If each child has 12 babies, the total number of children raised would be 48 = 40 + 8 = 48\nSo their total children would be 48*12 = 32.\nSo their total family would consist of 48 / 12 = 32.", "answer": "B: populated area"}

How many people were there at church on Sunday?\nOutput: If there were only 2,000 people attending the services at Church H, then Saturday's attendance was 2,000 divided by 3 = 600 divided by 3 = 750.\nSo Saturday's attendance was only 750 times Saturday's attendance is 3 = 3*750/(5+6]=750-150\nSince there were only 600 people during services on Saturday, Sunday's attendance was only 750 divided by 3 = 3*3*750/5 = 750 divided by 3 = 750\nSo 675/12 = 750 divided by 3 * 750 times 3 is 750 divided by 3 times 3 = 750 times 3 times 3 times 3 = 1575 times 3\nAfter the 1575 times 3, there were only 750 people attending church on Sunday.  So attendance Sunday was 750 times 1575 divided by 3 = 150 divided by 3 = 100/150 = 50/150\nSince there were 150 churches on Sunday, attendance Sunday was 75 divided by 3 / 1= 75/3\nSo Sunday's attendance was 75 times 150 divided by 1 = 75 times 1 / 2= 75.\nSo Sunday's attendance Sunday was 750 divided by 1 / 2*1/2 = 75/2 times 1\nSo Sunday's attendance + 1 / 2 = 75/2 times 100\nSo Sunday's attendance/2 * 100 = 3*1/2 * 100 times 3 / 100 times 3 = 33 times 3 times 3\nSince the church was 2/3 filled on Sunday, attendance Sunday / 2*100 = 3 times 3\nSo Sunday's attendance /2/3/3 times 1/3/3 / 3 times 3 = 75 times 1 divided by 3 / 3 times 3 = 150 times 0 times 1\nSince 1/3 of the church is filled everyday, it's average attendence on Sunday was 150 times 0 divided by 3 / 3 divided by 2= 150 divided by 3 times 3\nIt was the average attendence Sunday so the church was 50 times 3 times 3\nSo the average attendance Sunday was 50 times 0 times 1\nSo 0 times 1/1 times 3/(", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

If both rivers were drained to their full capacity, the entire California coast would be underwater. Both rivers were drained in a short period of time: 1964-68.\nThat the Chukchi River has been drained under 2 short periods of time is not surprising, since it is one of the lower-tributary rivers of the Sacramento River.  The Sacramento river, however, is in a much better condition than the Chukchi River.  The Sacramento River is the uppermost river of the two and is generally considered the state's most productive river.  Its waters go to the Delta, while the Chukchi River's water goes east across the Central Valley to the Pacific Ocean.  When both rivers are fully flowing, the Sacramento River drains 5.3 million people.

On Wednesday there are 5 people at the office, 1 at home, and 3 in traffic  The number of people in traffic is 1.  Each time a car enters the office, the number of people in traffic only increases.\nOutput: The number of people in work only increases twice and the number of the people in traffic only increases once.\nThe numbers are 1 * 6 = 2.  The extra cars in traffic will raise the total number of people in work by one.\nTherefore, if on Wednesday there are 5 people in work, and Friday there are 6 cars in traffic, then the extra cars in work will raise the total number in work by one. So there will be 5 total people in work.\nThus, if there are 20 people at work on Wednesday, and 3 people left in work on Friday, then the extra cars will raise the total number at work by one.

When asked what he picked, John says a random name. How many random names did John pick?\nOutput: Joe guessed >40. John guessing a random name = < 40.\nSince 2 = 1 and 8 = 1, you would expect John to give the number 8 to Joe.  Therefore, 8 + Joe = <<8-1=>>8.\nTherefore, 8 + Joe = <8-1=>>08.\nThis means John picked 8 = <<8>>08, a random name = <<8<>, and Joe picked = 8<>10. When asked what he chose, John says he picked a random name. So how many random names did John give?\nTherefore, John chose a random name = <<80>>80\nThis means John picked a random name = <<88>>88, a random number = <<88<>10, and Joe guessed = 88<>10. When told what he chose, John picked 8 = <<88>>88. Therefore, 8 + 88 = <<88<>8, a random name = 80<>, and Joe picked random name = 82<>10. When given a chance to clarify, John says that he asked his girlfriend what her number was.\nTherefore, John made the following choices = 8 = 80<>, 8<>10 = 10<>, 8<>6 = 6<>, and 8<>1 = 8<>. Therefore, 8 + 80 = 8<>8, a number = 8, a number = 8<>, and a number = 8<>1 = 80<>. Therefore, 8+80 = 8<>8.\nSo John chose 8 <>80 = 8<>, 8<>1 <> 8<>1, a number = 8 <>1 = 8<>, a number = 8<>. Therefore 8 = 8<>, a random name = 80 <>, and Joe chose random name = 82 <>. When asked what he chose to signify the same number, John says he chose a name so Joe knows what his number is. So John gave Joe 8 <>8 = 82 <>. Therefore, 8+", "answer": "D: food court"}

This is a network which has two or more computers that can share a file.\nIn the freeway file sharing, you can send a link from one computer to one or more other computers by either A, B or C. This internet file sharing is a way of carrying a file of any kind between 2 or more computers.\nIn the radio file sharing, you can get information from one computer to another by either A, B and C. File transfer of any kind between computers is made using radio link.\n\nThere are three answers to the first 2 questions, but none for the last 2 questions. Which two choices are the correct answers?\n\nInput: The house has no plumbing in the basement. If it is possible for the house to be heated with a heating coil in the upper floor, what is the most natural place for the heating coil to be installed?\nOutput: If it is possible to have a heating coil in the attic, the heating coil would be installed in the attic. Since that is a natural place, the heating coil would go in the loft\nSince it is not a natural place, the coil would go in the basement. That is the place of least air resistance. (So you must lower the temperature of air in the basement.)\nThe only other possibility is to place a furnace in the basement. The furnace would go into the basement where the temperature is the lowest. You will then have a very cold basement in which to burn your fireplace.\nThe only other possibility would be to have an electric hot air heater. That may work, but would use up a lot of power. What would be the most natural place to put a heating coil in today's world?\n\nInput: There is a large amount of trash in front of John's house. If they throw out the trash as soon as it is in the house, they will not run into any problems.

Then you must keep the trash from going in the house for 2 or 3 weeks. After that time it might become dangerous and you would have to clean up. If it becomes clean enough to live in, but dangerous, then you have to take it out to the dump by yourself.\nThere are only 3 choices", "answer": "D: computer network"}

How did this affect North America's food production in 2003?\nOutput: In 2003, more wheat was used in North America to make food than in South America.  Over 80% of the grain produced in America went to feed North Americans.\nSince food is manufactured in North America, it doesn't count it towards South America's food consumption.  To give South America the top producer of grain title, it had to raise it's feed-to-export ratio in less than 2 years.\nSo the final number in the North America category is 2*80+80*77 = <<2*80=240>>240 pounds of grain produced.\nSo the final food production number in North America is 240+240*80+80 = 482 pounds of grain produced\nSo the final food output number is 482-472x2+80+80*80*80=2419 pounds of grain produced\nIn North America, South America, and Japan, the number of grain produced increased (in a few years).\nBut China has stopped increasing production of grains, so their food consumption has decreased.\nSince the food eaten in North America decreased, the world food output number also decreased.\nIt decreased, but it is still a large number, so is the world food output number still significant?\nTo answer, consider the following two examples.\n\nInput: Every year,", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}

Then, for each $1,000 collected, the lawsuit should add $15.\nIf a lawsuit for the cost for repair added up to the manufacturer's cost, that is, the manufacturer's cost minus any profits from selling insurance policies, then assume that nothing is gained from the lawsuit and subtract $1,000 from the sued value.\nIf $1,000 isn't added to the lawsuit value, then the lawsuit value is less than the actual cost of repair.  Then $10 should be deducted for every additional $1,000.\nIf the lawsuit adds up to the manufacturer's claim and there is no excess profit from selling insurance policies, the lawsuit value is equal to the original amount collected for the original amount, $1.

The only way to reach the basket is to walk straight under it, or jump up and down and aim the net directly at the basket. However, it can only reach the basket if you jump up and down while it is shooting over the net.   How far can the net shoot:\nOutput: If you jump up and down to make it shoot a normal shot - you can't.  If you jump up and shoot a normal shot, you can only shoot it if someone is standing there and you step on their heads.  If you try both methods, you still will only shoot it from 2 ft. straight up.\nWhen you are shooting, the net will bounce off the top of the net.  When it bounces off the top of the top of the net, it should rebound. That rebound would go straight under the basket or it would bounce off of the ground behind instead of going over the net. If you are shooting from the end of the court, the net will always be in the front of you, so it won't make the rebound.  Otherwise, you could shoot under the hoop, shoot over the net, shoot under the other hoop, then hit the rebound on the other net.\nThe team has only 10 players and there are only 5 baskets.  So you can only shoot the net up to one basket, otherwise it will miss the basket.\n\nInput: When someone in a restaurant orders a drink, they add ice to the drink.

What does this mean?\nOutput: You would have to subtract the number of birds times the amount of energy in each egg.\nIf a bird has peckted an egg, the eggs are probably all broken.\nIf the number of birds is 10, then 10/2 = 4 eggs\nIf the number of hours is 11, then 11/2 = 4 hours\nThe last egg is broken.\nSince there are 4 eggs per bird, if the number of hours is 14, the eggs are probably broken and 10/2 = 4 hours.\nTherefore it is a 10/2 egg.\nThis egg contains 6 days.\nTherefore it is about 7 weeks\nSince it is 7 weeks since the last egg, there is one last egg\nTherefore it is about 10 weeks\n\ninput/output1.

He watched a video on how to make a dam so he was able to learn how to design a dam.  He watched another video on how to break down a dam so he was also able to know how to build a dam.  Now John can determine if a dam will be good enough to break down and if it should break down or not.  He can also determine the flow rate, and how many people will be able to go in and out of the dam at the same time.  He can also calculate the total amount of water that the dam should hold, or what it should hold.  Now John can decide to build a dam or not build a dam.\nInput:John decided to build a dam. What time should he start building it?\nOutput: John started building his dam at 8 am.  The time to be off the bus at lunch is 10 am.  He will be off the bus at 10 and start building the dam at 8.  The water that should be in the dam will be at the level of the concrete block, or that is how high the flow rate should be.\nSuppose, John decides to build his dam at 6 o'clock in the evening in the last hour of the day, on a hot day.", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

A car has 11 wheels. The truck rolls 1 wheel slower than the car does. What is the difference between the truck and the car?\nOutput: If a truck rolls 20 wheels slower than a car, this means that 20 * 1.2 = >>20*1.2 = >>>10\nThe car has a total of 11 = <<11*1.2=5>>5 wheels. A vehicle that rolls 20 wheels slower than the truck has 5 fewer wheels. Therefore, the truck has 10 fewer wheels. So the truck has = <<10*1.2=10>>10 wheels - 10 = <<10-1.2=0>>10 wheels.\nTherefore, a car is 10 * 1.2 = <<10/2>>2 wheels slower than a truck.\n\nInput: You are in a restaurant where a waiter is supposed to ring a bell for everyone.

My first reaction would be to look at my notes to see what was supposed to get done on each day. I remember seeing instructions to answer a number of questions (I think this was about the 7th day? The question was \u201cHow many Dobermans do puppies weigh?\u201d.) At least a half-dozen of those had things that were either not in the notes, not written or not spelled out in a very clear way. I don\u2019t remember much of what was on the first day, but the next couple days were very difficult because I had so many instructions.\n\nI thought the 5th grade students were well-suited for the work, as they don\u2019t have to do any algebra or trigonometry. They can work together and work through the problems, and they have a common interest in the puppies (they were really into the \u201cPuppy Challenge\u201d at the same school when I was working there). The adults, on the other hand, I thought were a little unprepared for the material. They were trying to come up with answers in 10 minutes, and they were spending the time looking at pictures of puppies. I think the puppies had to have been the main subject during the first few days, and the adult children might have needed a bit more time to get up to speed. But I think that some of the dogs didn\u2019t stand out as the main or most significant part of the material.\n\nThere were several dogs that were extremely different in weight, height, coat color or breed. I don\u2019m not sure where I stand on this, but in the first week I spent some effort on each dog to make sure that I was explaining how the particular characteristics of the dog applied to its unique characteristics. And each week, I would go and get pictures for the same dog and compare them. In the second week, I would look at a comparison of two \u201caverage\u201d dogs and start to go back and forth on what the differences were.\n\nWhat I learned: One of the most important lessons that I can recall as a fifth-grade teacher was that if I\u2019m going to write about something, it better come through", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

If John and Janet go 6 times, they will have married 64 times.  So they have an 80% chance of having another 6 wives.  If John has 64 wives, their chances are now 1 out of 600=<<1 out of 600=12>>12 women.  John's odds are now 1/2 million.\nIf John and his friends have been talking about how to make money buying real estate, they can go 12 times in the past.  They need to go 14 times to have a successful investment.  If John has only been talking about this once, he needs to do the calculations a 3rd time.  Thus, his odds of success are now 1/2,000.  Since his odds are 1/2, he had better go 14 times soon or he is unlikely to see any profit at all.  So it is more likely that John will keep to his original idea of only going 12 times.  Since he is not very likely to profit at all, he should probably stay with 12 times.\nSo the chance that John gets his wife back is 1 out of 6000.  If John has 6 wives, that is only 16% chance of getting back his wife", "answer": "A: being understood"}

How much extra food does the waitress buy?\nOutput: If A buys the waitress, the dishwasher will buy 2 dishes for the diner and 1 for the dog.\nSo if A buys dinner for the waitress, then the waitress will buy 5*2 = <<5*2=15>>15 dishes and a dog.  The human will buy 2*15=<<15-2=1>>1 dishes and a car.  The dog will buy 5*1/2 = <<5*1/2=10>>10 dishes and a shirt.  The human will get 10*1/2 = 10*1/2=15 dishes and a t-shirt.  The dog will get 5*1/2 * 10*1/2*5 = 5*1/2 x 5 = <<25>5 shirts.  The cat will buy 5*1/(25*5)1 = <<25*5=1.5>>1 dishes.

{"text": "First find three dictionary words with the same definition:\nBANX: A financial instrument used as a bridge between one account and another. Example:  A broker buys an option on a stock at a price above its strike price, and sells an option on the same stock at a lower price than its strike price. Example:  Anne buys an option on a CD-ROM at an annual yield of 3%, and puts it on a money market at a cost of 0%. She sells the money market and buys a CD-ROM at a price below its strike price, and puts that money on a CD-ROM. The options will be the price difference between the money market and the CD-ROM after the end of the year. Example: The broker buys a CD-ROM for 1.0% annually and Anne buys it for 0.1% annually. That year she receives 3% return on her investment. Example: If she gets 100 shares of stock for $1, she sells 30 of them for $0.85 a piece. That would make her 100 shares worth $0.15 a pop. Example: If Anne bought the CD-ROM for $1, she would give up the option and her CD-ROM would be worth $1.00. Then Anne could sell her CD-ROM for $0.85 and make 3% interest. Example: If Anne puts a CD-ROM on her CD-ROM, she loses her CD-ROM. She then purchases another CD-ROM of the same CD-ROM-only company for $0.5 a pop, buys it at a $2.00 premium, and puts that on her CD-ROM. Example: If Anne buys 100 CD-ROM disks from the Amazon online store for $6.00 each, she would receive 200 CD-ROM disks. That brings her total cost of the CD-ROM to $1.00 of her $6.00.

{"text": "Listen to the expert and learn to think critically and empathize\n\nInput: John had one of his teeth pulled. He was given 4 pain shot for a total of 6 teeth pulled.  When he went to be sedated, the anesthesia did not take effect in his jaw and he lost 5 teeth.  He was then put back to sleep for 1 1/2 hours after his mouth was removed.  He lost another 4 teeth from his face.  After a while when he woke up, he found 3 more missing teeth that he did not have during his sedation.  He then went back to see a dentist again and had three more teeth pulled.  This time, he lost one more tooth.  When he saw the dentist again, he was given 7 shots, but all of his teeth had already been pulled.  As a result, the dentist gave John two months to have all the teeth pulled.  After that, he took 2 months of prednisone to clean them.  When he went back with his dentristist for more shots, he said, \u201cI have already lost 2 teeth. Are you going to pull more or more?\u201d\nOutput: John received four shots, which included one shot to clean his teeth.  The dentistry removed 6 teeth.  If John had only had one shot, the first 6 teeth would have been removed, leaving 7 teeth to be pulled.  The dentist said, \u201cI am sure they were happy, John, to have 3 more teeth to pull.\u201d\nIf John had only had one of every shot, that would be 1 + 6 = 7, but he only received 4 shots; that is 2 + 6 = 5.  So each shot had two pieces of teeth removed, and so he ended up with 5 teeth to remove.\nIf all 4 shots were given together, that would be:\n2\n2 + 6 = 8 + 8 = 16\n16 - 8 = 13\n13 - 2 = 7\nSo John received more shots than he did before this happened.

This will cost her 12 extra dollars.  How much extra will she have to pay for her coffee?\nOutput: The extra cost of the extra cup will be 12*12 = <<12/12=48>>>48 dollars.\nIn the same year, the extra cost of the extra coffee will be 48 + 12 = <<40-12=60>>>60 dollars.\nIn 10 years the extra cost of the coffee will be 60*12 = <<120-12=180>>>180 dollars; and in 20 years the extra cost will be 120*12 = <<160-12=180>>> 180 dollars\nAnd in 30 years the extra cost will have gone up 160*12 = <<140-12=180>>> 120 dollars.\nSo the final price will have increased 160*12 = <<200-12=480>>> 480 dollars\nSo the final price increases in 200/2 => 2*120/(2*2*2*8) => 200/4 => 2*240/(2*240/(2*20)) => 60/200 = 60 dollars more\nSo the final price = 60-$280\nSo 50 cents more, or $40 more, or $80 more, or $120 more, or $160 more, for the same amount of coffee.\n\nInput:On Monday, the wind blew 20 miles out of the north by noon, blowing east by 2pm, blowing west by 1pm and blowing out of the northeast by 4pm.

He feels tired and has a headache. He goes to the bathroom and sees a small puddle of water next to the toilet. He does not want to spend any money washing the toilet. Why would he wash the toilet before going to school?\nOutput: Because he feels tired and has a migraine. He will not have to wash the toilet until he gets to school.\nSince he does not want to go to school, and is too afraid to wash the toilet, he will wash the toilet once he gets to school. Then he will not have to worry about not having to wash the toilet.\nSince he is too tired and afraid to wash the toilet and would not go if he had to wash it before he went to school, he will not pay any money and just wash it without paying.\nSo when he enters the bathroom, which will be filled with clean water and not filled with toilet water, he will not wash the toilet.\nFinally, because he will not have to pay for the toilet, he will not let anyone know that he washed the toilet; instead, he will just let the bathroom sink dry in time.\nSo when he reuses the toilet (the sink will dry in time), he will only wash it once, and not twice as he previously washed it.\n\nInput: Bill leaves the house at one in the afternoon and travels to four different towns to shop and do some other things.

This is how a civil action is instituted.\nHowever, if it takes more than one person to initiate a civil action, then it is an \"instantaneously organized\" civil action; it does not take into consideration whether any additional people are interested or are willing to participate.  This is how an instantantly organized civil action is initiated.\nIt should be noted that once an action is instituted, it cannot be canceled or recanted.  However, once an action is deemed invalid, or is set aside without trial, it can be repealed by written or judicial action.  An action can only be \"canceled\" or \"settled\" by a person's own direct action (civil, criminal, or administrative).\nAn action cannot \"be rescinded\" or \"set aside\" even if the initial action had only been enacted or started by one party.  However, if two or more people were involved in initiating one or more actions, if those two or more parties were in contact with one another, both could have been affected in some fashion.  It could not only be an \"instantly organized\" civil action, but could also be an \"instantaneously arranged\" civil action (instantiated), meaning that such an action could not legally be initiated without two or more people being present.  In most instances where two or more people are called to participate, and all of those people want to participate, that can be a major factor in initiating a civil action.\n\nInput: The moon was over 100 yards wide Tuesday morning, yet it was clear, not dark.

I know, the snow that fell on Monday was 50 inches, but what about the days before that?\nOutput: Divide the total snow that fell on the ground in the month of February by the total snow that fell in February. This produces:\nFebruary's total snow = 50 * 37 * 22 = 583.33 inches\nFebre-tial (that is the snow number including Monday) = 583.33 x 50 = 53.83 inches\nThat's 53,883.33 inches of snow, or 583,533.33 inches. So, yes, the total snow was 53,883.33, or 53,883.33 * 53.83 = 53,883,333 inches, and that is what the total amount is.\n\nInput: You are the only one in the family who watches TV.

He can walk no more than 1 mile, and if he runs more than 1/2 mile he will need a water and rest stop.  His feet hurt so he decides to stop at a restaurant along the way to rest his feet for 30 minutes.  Would he benefit from stopping at this restaurant at the end of the day?\nOutput: Yes.  The restaurant would be a good place to rest because it is on an incline and has bathrooms.  So he should take at least 1 rest stop along the way.\nTo determine if he should or not, he should consider if: 1 - The restaurant was near his home and there was no rest break along the way or\n2 - The restaurant was on an incline and had plenty of bathrooms.  In many cases, people who run very far on a treadmill will only take a restroom break during a rest break.  So, he is unlikely to get enough rest (more than 1 hour) at the rest stop.\nFor example, a woman may walk the mile on her treadmill for 45 minutes and then take a rest for 20 minutes.  She may need one bathroom break, but if it is 5 minutes away, she may walk about another 3 miles before taking a break.  She will need to leave the rest stop by the end of her round to replenish her fluids.  This would make a one hour rest stop unlikely.  However, a two hour rest stop is possible.  She needs a break to stay on the treadmill because the treadmill gets quite tiring after 45 minutes.  If walking is her only option, she may want to stop at a rest stop.\n\nInput: A teacher and a teacher with a lot of experience each take a train to work for 15 minutes.

In this case he will make 1 day off, so the amount of days he has to work would be 1.\nLet's say that his work is 2 weeks and today is a half-day. In this case, he has to work Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.\nLet's say he takes a second half day tomorrow morning, and his work is 2 weeks, so he's working 2 weeks worth of work today.\nLet's say his work takes 2 weeks, that means tomorrow he has to go home and sleep in his car.\nSo today would be the 1st day John has to get all of his work done, but he has 2 extra days of work left.\nSo he has to work Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\nFinally, let's say he's on a 4 week course and takes a 1st half-day tomorrow. He'll still have 4 weeks worth of work today, so his average will be 2.72 days, but it's 2.72 x 4 = 6.57\nSo his total workload today is 4 weeks.\n6.57 x 4 = 62 days of work.\nSo his yearly workload is 62 days, which means it took him one year and 52 days to get his job done\n\nInput: Which of the following is wrong? 2.

{"text": "All of the above!\n\nInput: In a recent case, a couple was in bed together early, and later a court ordered the man to stay away from the woman for eight days. The man thought that if she didn't put him in the house alone, he could sleep there for four days straight. He got so excited about this that he packed all of his things into a U-Haul vehicle. When he dropped off his belongings at the house, he was told by a tenant that a \"strange smell\" had been detected coming from the house over the past week. After a long drive around the block, the man was able to locate a car parked in the driveway and, when he opened the driver's side door, he found not only some of his belongings, but \"strange moldy looking stuff sitting on the floor, along with some sort of dust/fume type of thing\". The homeowner got a sample taken from the moldy-looking stuff, and that tested positive for mold. After the court appointed the man to stay away, his lawyer pointed out to her that the evidence was not sufficient to get him into trouble. She argued that, since the man was staying in the garage, he was clearly not in the house, but the smell was still detected. When the man came into the garage, she told him that an officer of the court had been on a drive around the block and had been able to \"perform an odometer test on the road in front of the house, and she was pleased with the results, which indicated that the odometer wasn't the kind with odometer buttons on it\". When the man got out of the car, he found \"other items\" in the garage as well. When they spoke to the policeman, he agreed that the smell seemed \"strange\".\nWhen tested, the odometer showed that, rather than running 50,000 km over the 8 day period, the odometer ran about 28,000 km, giving a total mileage of 44,000 km. So the final answer is 44000\n\nInput: If there is just one piece of an object, how many objects does one find?\nOutput: The first object is just one.\nSecond object is two.\nThird object is four.\nFourth object is six.\nFifth object is eight.\nSix is nine.\nSeventh eight.\nEighth nine.\nNinth tenth.\nEleven twelfth.\nTwelfth thirteenth.\nFour", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

People drove around in snow blowers, shoveled, and cleared 6 more inches of snow off the school sidewalks. What was the total amount of snow removed that day?\nOutput: Since people dug down and removed 6 inches of snow, they removed 1 - 6*6 = 9 inches\nSo 1 - 6*6=9 = 5 inches of snow fell on Wednesday, and 5 * 6*6 = 18 inches fell on Thursday\nSo the total amount of snow on campus was 18 inches.\nSince it was Wednesday, this number is 18 * 6 = 60 inches\nSo the final amount of snow on campus is 6*60 = 9000 inches\nSo the final total is 9000 x 18 = 25000 inches\nThe total snow is 25000 - 9000 = 26000 feet in the air.  So the total amount of snow is 27000 feet.\nSo the final amount is 26000 x 27000 = 34000 feet in the air\nThat is an 18 foot radius of surface snow, which is just under 12 feet high.\n\nInput: The person whose house is on the top of a mountain can see all five continents in the world.

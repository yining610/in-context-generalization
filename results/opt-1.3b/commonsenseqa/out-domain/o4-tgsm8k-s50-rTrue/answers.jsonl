He is very lucky. Two days ago, John Smith, on vacation, found a perfect pen on the ground. Then two days ago, on the other coast, he found two more pens that were not as good, they were both about the same price. If he had thrown them in the garbage, he would have had to buy a new pen. The first pen cost him $2. The second pen cost him $3. If he had not found them, he would have had no pen to use. Which of the following is the correct answer?\nOutput: John Smith threw 10 pens in the garbage (which is 2 pens per person).\nThe first pen cost him $1. The second pen cost the same as the first. If he had to spend $2 to buy another pen, then he would have spent $2 = $2 * 1.5 = $3.\nWhen he used the first pen, he got 1/3 of the work done. If he had used the second pen, he would have been finished 2/3 the way through. If he had just thrown out the second pen, he might have had to spend a total of $6. Therefore, John Smith spent $2 * 1.45 = $6.\nThe second pen cost him $2 because it has a different ink. Because two pens cost the same price, if he purchased the first pen, he would have lost the opportunity to use a pen that cost less than the second pen. When he used the first pen instead of the second pen, he still had the opportunity to improve 1.45 * 1.6 = 3.3% of his work done.\nThe third pen cost him $3 because his company has a policy that is against people giving money. Also, 3 = 3, because 3/4 of John Smith's work was done using pen #2. Therefore, the pens cost $3 = 3.\nAfter he discovered the pen, John Smith realized he could have received another pen from his boss. He could have given the new pen to his boss instead of throwing them in the trash. But he gave it to the person with the best handwriting. The recipient had a nice handwriting, so he got the extra pen.", "answer": "B: lack of money"}

Each person in the group has the ability to produce either two items or one item.  A person is always able to produce either two items of similar value or one item of unique value.  A person is not always able to produce two items of similar value and each person has the ability to produce one item of unique value that is valuable in some set or set of ways.  If a person has the ability to buy one item of unique value,  an item that a person does not have the ability to produce, then the item of unique value that person can produce is worth  times  value ($i=1, 2, 3).  For example, if a person has the ability  to produce only one item of value, then $1 = value of only one item.  Therefore, a person who only buys one item of value (value of only one item in this example) is worth $1 times $i, while every other person in the group who only buys one item is worth  times $i.\n\nOutput: The following list is in case order.

How will this new system affect you?\noutput: If you save your money now that your age will be higher, you won\u2019t get your final paycheck for a long time but you will likely be getting a large chunk of money for life that will allow you to live with dignity and respect. If you delay your retirement, you will have to pay back what you have saved with a lower Social Security check every week for 35 years.\nSave it now instead of spending big on expensive items now that you may not have the money later.\nYour friends and family can save more money by reducing spending on unnecessary goods and services that can wait until you have money available.\nDoing nothing will not solve your retirement problems.\nFor example, people who go on vacation when their savings are low are likely to need retirement support in the form of a pension.\n\ninput: During the 1970s, President Johnson was determined to take care of his family.

He went back to his best friend, who still had a lunchbox. The teacher came back and told him to just put the lunch box and backpack in his backpack, but that didn\u2019t work. The next day, Pablo saw the teacher again. He gave the teacher his lunchbox and backpack back. Pablo said that he had no idea what happened to his lunchbox and backpack, and he knew that he should have never had a lunchbox in the first place.\nSo Pablo and his friend decided to take his lunchbox and backpack to school the next week.

{"text": "Choices are correct.  If I take my hand off the computer and find the pressure outside, it is still around -30oC.  Now I can see it's getting cold; the wind is blowing against my face.  In this environment, I'm going to breathe air that hasn't had much oxygen in it over a long time.\nNow I can tell I'm in a tunnel; that's a sign that the pressure is -60oC to -20oC.  That's cold enough!  The tunnel is about 3 feet longer and I'll be inside for a long time.  It will be windy but not to a point where I'll get cold.  If I can handle it then I can probably make it to work on time; I can't do that for too long without becoming sick.  I'll still feel the wind though and will need to keep the hood up as I breathe.  The tunnel will be dark but even in the light of day the wind will blow and the air will get cold.  The temperature in the tunnel will not change and it will be warm or cold depending on how long I can stay there.\nSo the solution for today is to breathe in the oxygen rich air (in the tunnel), close the hood, and wait outside for the cold to pass.\nSo the final solution is 30\n\nPlease vote for other options in the comments at bottom of this page. A short version of this problem is in the answer to your last question that I posted below and this answer is as close as I got. I can't remember the exact formula; you may have to check in a textbook or on the Internet.\n\nRemember that questions to this format are for practice not to solve problems on your own. The only solution that I have is a 10x10 grid. It looks like a square grid, but it's about 70 inches long, has about 90 degrees in each direction and it has about 20 squares. It has 10x10 cells with 3 cells in each each. They are in 4 directions, but they have no cells between them so you can put whatever you don't need in between them. (That's what you're supposed to do). I've got a PDF version that you can look at at your leisure (you can save it to your computer.)

{"text": "A: town Y Y: city Z Z: phone book Z\n\nInput: An accountant is to calculate the income tax due to the federal government and the state government for a tax return for a business. The accountant has 20 accounts for which the tax is due. She has to calculate 20% on each account.  All 20 accounts have the same value of $1,000, so the tax due is $1,000 / 20 = $150. What percentage of the tax due should be deducted for each account?\nOutput: The tax due was calculated.  1/20 = 13.53%\nTotal tax paid was $150 divided in 3 equal parts of $150 =$15.53\nTax rate of $15.53 / $15.53 divided by $15.53 divided = $11\nTherefore, the final total of the tax paid was $13 plus $11 divided by $13.53 / $13 divided by... = $5\nSo the total tax due was $4 plus $11 divided by 3 equals $4 divided by 13, so the final answer is 13\n\nInput: How many students is the average person in your town?\nOutput: What should the teacher be paid for writing the tests?\nOutput:  The average teacher is paid for doing nothing.

The average test for the 7 students was 210 points higher than the average student who had not written the average test.\nSo the final average score for the 7 students was 410\nBased on these calculations, the average teacher should receive $1,000 for writing the tests and $150 for writing the average score.\nSo the total average teacher's salary for writing the tests and writing the average score was $6,000 / 7 = $6000\nSo the total salary for writing the tests should be $600, and the average salary for writing the average score should be $800\nSo the initial teacher's salary was $600, and the total teacher's salary was $800 for writing the tests\nSo the total salary of the entire teaching force was $6,000 + 8 = $8,000\nThe average salary was $16,000, and the average total teacher's salary was the same as the teacher's first salary\nTherefore, the final average teaching salaries were $10,000 + 8 =$12,000", "answer": "C: city"}

How much will he have left by the end of the buying spree which can be divided amongst the brothers per page that they earn?\nOutput: Divide the remaining 20 cents he would have left by 25 divided by 125 = <<200/25=40>>40 books that the children will read.\nSo each brother gets 40 books worth of reading on a $70 investment, or $40/125 = <<40/125=0.5>>0.5\nBy finishing the buying spree and dividing up the amount of books the children already own, the children have half the books they need. However, there is still a very large amount of unused books which can be sold on Kijiji and Ebay at a very high price. These books will probably earn more money than the children have used, so each book has been over valued. But the overall sum is still very small, so it is still a win.

It would appear that at least two people are making more than the average  contribution = B+C=A+B.  So we would say that C makes more than the average, or the theoretical, is one person.  Which is how we use the word \"theoretical\".  And \"average\" would indicate that some contribution made more than the theoretical.\nNow let us look at it another way, let us talk about how many people can put their name on a mailing list.  Theoretically we know how many names are there if we know how many members each list has = B+C=AB/A.  But how does our average person contribute = ABC + B + C?  So this is:\n(ABC+A+B)=C+B/AB\nSo the theoretical average contribution is therefore:\nB+C+C=C+B/AB  And we need:\nC/AB = 1/AB", "answer": "C: san francisco"}

{"text": "He is a crab, so he cannot scuttle\nTherefore, the answer is crabs\n\nInput: You have two large containers and two small ones. You decide to fill the container with water. Fill these containers to the top with water. Which container has the most water by the end of the day?\nOutput:\nSince the weight of water in the first container is greater than the weight of water in container 2, so the first container will have more water when the sun is up. The amount of water that will be in container 2 by sunset is smaller than the amount of water in container 1 by the time of sunset. Therefore, the first container will have less water when the sun goes down. The amount of water in container 2 will be less than that in the first container by the time the sun disappears from the sky, so it will have more water than the previous one. The difference between the final weight and the water in the first container can be calculated by subtracting the first container\u2019s weight from the container\u2019s weight at the time of the sunset.\nSo the final water in the first container will be 7 kg, compared to the water in the second container, which will be 4 kg. Because the second container has less water than the first one, it will have a higher average weight. The extra water in the second container will weigh 1 kg. Therefore, the extra water in the second will contribute 1 kg weight to the total weight of 7 kg in the first container.\nThus, by the time the sun sets in the first container, the first container will weigh 7 kg, compared to 9 kg in the second container. Therefore, the first will have more water than 9 kg and the second will have less water than 6 kg.\nTherefore, the water in the first will weigh 19 kg, compared to 22 kg in the second container by the time the sunlight goes down.\nTherefore, the amount of extra water in container 1 will be 22 kg. The amount of extra water that is in the second container will be 17 kg. Therefore, there will be less water in container 1 by 5 kg. The water in both containers will weigh 7 kg, so they will have 7 kg water at the start of the day.\nSo the final total in container 1 is 7 kg/2. It will be 24 kg/2 by the time the sun goes down in container 1 by the sunset time. The final total in the second container will also be 24 kg/2. It should", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

{"text": "Inflation does not cause any problems.\n\nInput: A bank is a savings and investment company, and there is a group of students who want to create a new savings credit union. They want to offer better service, and they have decided to take on a deposit of $10 million dollars in order to start savings credit union with a mission to reduce interest rates and increase profits. In order to create savings credit union, the group needs a deposit guarantee that allows it to offer higher rates of return to customers. The deposit guarantee is given to the bank, and the students fund it with 5% of the deposits from the bank. If depositors cannot meet their deposits, the 5% will be returned to them via loans. At the time of the guarantee, the interest rate on lending at the bank is 2% a year.  What is the expected level of interest income on the students loans?\nOutput: The students will receive 0 dollars in return from the guarantee after two years, which means their interest income will be $10 million after 2 years, $20 million after three years, and $30 million after four years.\nThe expected rate of return will remain constant until the bank\u2019s total deposit is $75 million, and then it will fall to 4%, which will be the expected return of interest on all of the new loans made at the bank from now on. The net interest income for the bank will be $30 million after four payments, or $6 million a year.\nIn the past year, the bank lost 0.5% of its deposits. If the savings credit union is set up with a deposit guarantee, it can generate 0.5% of the original $30 million in interest income each year, which is enough to cover the loan payment by the bank at the interest rate of 2%.

They start to play the second song while everyone is playing the first. This allows everyone to get the song without missing it.

The band stops while the orchestra continues (although sometimes they stop only while the orchestra is playing), usually a trumpet solo is played.\nThe orchestra only plays one concert a year.

{"text": "Increases energy, loose skin, health and beauty\nThere are 2 different groups: the group that lost the most weight, that is, gains energy, looses skin and loose skin. The \u201cgain energy\u201d group increases energy by a lot. They also lose one pound a week even though the extra pounds are water weight. The loss group decreases skin and loose skin but increase overall health. The beauty group has the same effects on the physique and health, but it also removes one pound of fat a month. The death group will also show the changes in the body and the changes in the physique. The people who have lost the most weight will have the greatest change in their physique; but there are also people who have had the most changes in their entire body. These changes reflect the total amount of weight lost; but for the weight gain group, that the weight gain does not match the body weight. (The gain group is the group that had the greatest change in their body.)\nOutput: For the group that lost the least weight, the results are the same. It does not matter which group has the most or least changes. The main difference is that the group that has the greatest changes in physical physique have lost the most weight; and the losers have actually gained the most weight in weight.\n\nInput: A boy was about to leave his classroom for a party.

After it has turned green it becomes a moor. It flies up into the air and then it gets out. The wings of the moor leave a path, or a trail, as it flies. Once it leaves the moor its body gets a little bigger and it flies up into the sky. Once it gets in the sky it loses wings, much like a butterfly getting ready to lay eggs. Then it is ready to fly away. The wings on the moor are longer than the wings on the butterfly. This is because moths don\u2019t have wings, they have wings like wings on a caterpillar that have their own body in place of the wings of a butterfly. This is only because moths have not turned into butterflies yet.\n\ninput: _____ _____ _____ ____ _____ _____ ______ ____ ____ ______ _______ ______ _______ ______ ____________ _______ ______\noutput: _____ ______\n\ninput: a baby bird was born while his parents were sleeping. his parents told him \"don't ever go to sleep or we will hurt you. you will never be able to survive on your own so we will only foster you until you are big enough to handle things by yourself.\" when he opened his eyes", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

{"text": "Orchestra C D E\nThe first choice is the wrong answer. You can hear a bassoon without any discomfort, the second one is a little wrong but the other two are right.\nSo the final question is, A or B?\nInput: An adult can play the violin while standing at the right height while the violin bow is in his mouth. When his hands are on the bow, there is a sharp crack when the bow gets close to his mouth. If he makes his hands stay on the bow and does not have a sharp crack, the violin will sound more musical.  If he moves away from the bow and does not need to move his hands toward it for any given length of time, the violin will sound less musical.  The best example of this is the sound of a violin bow when the bow is too low to be comfortable for a player (lower than the player\u2019s chin)\nOutput: The sound of a violin bow is affected by a player's position in a room and the amount of time that the bow is exposed to air.  When playing the violin in close quarters or for very long periods of time with no break in play, the bow makes sharp cracks, causing a high-pitched ringing noise.  When playing the bow while the player is standing at eye level in a room away from others, the bow produces a dull, unpleasing \u2018woof\u2019.\nSo the final equation is:\nE < < E< E< E<\nOutput: The violin bow with fingers on the bow produces a sharp, unpleasant \u2018woof\u2018 sound and is very difficult to play in close quarters.  The hand, without fingers on the bow, however, produces a dull, unimportant \u2018whoooo\u2019 sound when the bow is not close to the player\u2019s mouth.  It is difficult to say for certain the proper way to play a violin because of the many varied factors, but the most common way to play a violin is with a bow having fingers on the bow\n\nInput: How many days does it take to paint 2 1/2 square feet of the beach?Input: 2 days\nOutput: 3 days\nThe difference between the two answers is the difference in number of days it took to paint two 1/2 square feet.\n\nInput: Two people are driving on a motorway at 90 mph when the vehicle suddenly slows and the driver gets distracted.

She found a book in a bookshop that was for $1.00. Jenny plans to purchase an extra book, and she was given an extra dime for her effort.  Her two younger children are in a classroom with 50 pupils. The teacher in charge charges $200 a month. How many children would it take, of the total fifty, to earn that money? She uses three children in her class. If she charges $75 a month, how much money would she make per student per month on three children? She sets up an experiment to find out.  She divided the pupils by the class numbers. She counted every child in the class in 10 min.  She took 60 minutes at 30mins each. She counted 60 pupils in the classroom, and divided by ten.  She took 30 mins as the time allowed, and took 60mins each.  There were two children in each classroom.  Total 50 pupils = $1200 each.\nThe teacher gets $200 monthly per pupil. Divide that by 10 pupils, and she makes $1200 per month.\nSo the teacher makes $1200 on 60 mins/month = $1200/10 = $1200 / 20, which is a return of $200/20 = $75/20.\nSo the teacher earns $1200 / 20 = $75/20 for her 60 mins of work, which is a return on her 60mins of labor.\nSo the teacher gets 20 / 20 = $75 / 20 for her 60 mins of labor = $75 / 20, which is $100/20 for her 60mins of work.\nSo the teacher buys the extra book, and earns $100/20 = $600 / 20 = $600 / 20 for 60 minutes of work.\nSo she buys the extra book, for $100", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

She decides on $15.50 as her salary figure, $2500 being the average. The next table compares the number of shoes and the total cost to have the teacher change her shoes each year.\nOutput: Let our teacher try to buy as many pairs of shoes as she can each year with her salary at $15.50. She would have to use $450 a year to do that. If she uses that much, then her total cost would be $350 per year\nOutput: Teacher's shoes, after using $150 to get a pair, would cost only $400 to replace each year\nOutput: Teacher can only buy 8 pair of shoes every two years, so the total cost is $150 per pair\nOutput: Teacher pays an extra $350 per year, so the total cost to buy shoes is $225 per pair\nOutput: If teacher only wants to get shoes for two years instead of four, then she can spend $225 on shoes, meaning she will only spend $275 per year\nOutput: the total cost of shoes is $175, so teacher will use an extra $100 a year to get more", "answer": "E: family room"}

So in ten months (during June to July) she paid $15 dollars per hour, which amounts to approximately $150 per month. That\u2019s one hundred and fifty dollars per month.

Which gift they decide to buy?\nOutput: B \u2013 each girl will buy a gift of $35 each for the third date of the three weeks.\nSo the final overall answer is 50\n\nInput: A young girl was invited by her friend to go out to dinner. She was invited to dinner three times in a row. If you were asked to pay $75 of the bill it would be $25 after her pay and $75 then after the payer's tip. Which amount would you pay? How much would the girl have to pay? How would you figure it out?\nOutput: 75 + $25 + tip = $75\nThe girl was invited by her friends so Harper added 15% of the total of the tip and $50 of the remaining.

The cost of 4 of the children's college education is $90,000. The total cost of the remaining two children is $28,000. A wants to contribute to the college education and give 5 per cent of her income to the education. A's husband wants to contribute $40,000 and A needs to give $26,000 to meet the two parents' financial obligations. So A needs to give $3,000 per child. She has $6,900 in savings. She plans to put $3,000 into her savings account and $2,600 into the education account. If she has extra cash on hand, she can put $1,500 into the education account.\nChoose A.\n\nFor each of the following statements, state the correct value of all the options:\n\nInput: A company paid $10,000 to build a new headquarters.

What savings amount can she put into her savings account if A earns $800 the rest if her retirement?\nOutput: If A earns $800 during her work at the building company and earns $800 during her remaining retirement, and A's total savings is $6,900, then she can contribute $6,900 $<6,900> / 16 = $<8/80> or $8/80 = $8/80 = 30\nIf A earns $500 in retirement, she can put $500 into the retirement account. If she can earn $100 per year in retirement, she can contribute $250 per year in retirement. So she can put $500 in a savings account; $750 in a retirement account; and then $500 per year in an account that is invested with $750. She can do this, so long as her total savings is $6 million.\nSo she can put $3 million into retirement ($1500 / 12 x 0.04), $5.25 million into savings ($500 / 12 x 0.14), and then $5 million into retirement ($250 / 12 x 0.05).

Do the kids get better by staying with their parent?  Or should they be left alone while their dad is away? The answer is simple.  Letting the parents go makes it a 50-50 chance that both kids will be ok.  But letting the kids stay with their father is a 10,000 to 1 chance that both kids will not be ok.  It also means that there is less chance one of the children will be better off leaving with you guys and going to stay with their dad.  The choice is this.  Do the kids stay with mom or father?

A cow\u2019s son has one.  How many times does the calf need to be milked to produce milk from both legs before the calf is the same as a cow?\nOutput: A milk cow needs less than 2 legs to produce milk. A legless calf doesn\u2019t require as much milk. Therefore, the calf won\u2019t take as much milk. Therefore: >calf doesn\u2019t milk >calf = cow.\nThe calf is the same as the cow now. We are now changing to the cow\u2019s son since the calf was not able to produce milk yet.\nThe calf is still milked twice a day as a routine. However, it needs to be milked less each time. So, the cow, when the calf is milked less than once a day it is still the calf.\nHowever, as soon the calf is milked more than once a day, it is no longer the calf.\nTherefore: >calf doesn't milk >calf = milk >cow\nThe cow still needs to be milked, so it\u2019s not the same as the calf.\nSo the final solution is cow\u2019s son >>cow\nThe cow has only milked twice in the last 60 days, so it is still the calf according to your definition.\nSo the cow", "answer": "C: underwater"}

When Ms. Paine begins to tell the children how much worse it would have been to lose the building, the children want to know why she let them go on vacation in the first place.

How much does the first employee need to take every year to get the same vacation days?\nOutput: $100*100/3 = $<<100/3=10>>10\nOne of the paychecks is $100, so the first employee has $10 vacation days. If that check becomes $100 next year, he will have $90 vacation days left. So the first employee needs to take every year at least $90 vacation time before the $100 check becomes $100. So the first employee will need $150 vacation time. He will need to invest that money to take $70 vacation time.\nThe third employee will need to invest that $150 vacation time to take $70 vacation day. So the third employee will need $150-70 = $<<150-70=45>>45 vacation days. So the third employee needs $1540 vacation time.\nThe second employee will need only $1540 vacation time but that vacation time is only $10 days longer than his vacation time from the year before.

You could pick up the taxi in the airport.\nOutput: The taxi will take 12 hours to drive. The car trip cost $30 and is time-consuming so you pick it. You also are less concerned about baggage because it\u2019s a one-way trip.\nSo the final answers is three different ways to get to where you\u2019re going.\nLet\u2019s assume you take the taxi to get to the airport for only two-thirds of the trip, while the other third is covered by the plane ticket. That leaves the third third of the trip as a rental car. Suppose that the rental rate is $30/day. That price includes the cost of the car and the cost of the gasoline as well, and it would be $4 per day, giving you a total for the two-thirds remaining. That leaves you the rest to use for groceries. Since you have only three days left to get to the airport (assuming you don\u2019t delay it), it makes sense that you use a rental car, otherwise the food costs will be too steep for you to maintain the car.

The beach is only about 15 minutes away, but you need to rent a car. You need to buy gas, a cooler and an umbrella. You also need to buy a blanket in case it is a really hot day. Once they have everything else ready go pick up your friends at their place of choice, which will only take about 20 or 30 minutes. With a full beach day you will be able to spend all of your money on you. (or less)\n2. When you go buy your gas, you need to make a reservation and pay the first month's fee to them. You also need to purchase 6 tokens and pay an additional fee for each person. This money is used to buy gas and to pay for rental time at the beach. As you have spent an excessive amount on gas already, buying tokens will save you on gas.\n3. After you have all bought your tokens you must decide how to spend your $6 dollars each, buy a beer, or use one of your tokens to buy food.\n4. After all of the money you have spent on food, gas and the tokens has been spent, your group can relax by playing an Xbox game called, \u201cLife-Simulator\u201d. After you play three rounds you will have $6 left.\n5. After the food is bought, drink and tokens have been spent (which is probably about 90% of your remaining vacation cash), you have to figure out what else you can buy for about $6. Since you are now in charge you can probably put the money you have left in a savings account and you can also buy beach merchandise for future fun.\n6. For $6 you have purchased two beers, two coolers, and a blanket you all can enjoy together on the beach. Since you have spent so much money in one day you can now invest the rest into a beach house to rent in the future. (The rest of the day)\n7. You will never use the blanket again after spending $6 on it so you can put it in your house for when you do go back.\n8. After you have invested all of your money back into the beach", "answer": "C: lake"}

I believe that in order to make money, an individual should try to find work that is at least 12 hours per week.  If they want to increase their income, they should find something with at least 60 hours per week.  I think it should also pay $200 per month.  What should the average person earn in order to be comfortably wealthy and able to earn more?\nOutput: Let's try to guess at some possible numbers here.  People who make $400,000 per year can make $200,000 in three months.  People who make more than $500,000 per year, can make $100,000 in two months.  So a person who makes $400,000 can earn $200,000 in only two months.  I think it would be much less expensive to work for a couple years, make a little money, and move on.\nTherefore, it is far more likely that someone would make more money than $200,000 than it is likely that someone would make less than $200,000.  Therefore, this is one of the four possibilities for the average person to make money.\n\nInput: I hear", "answer": "A: special"}

The boys are given a choice as to what the horse will like to eat.  On the table, there is a cup with a bucket on top.  The boys fill the cup, and then they ask the one boy what he wants to eat, and he replies by asking, \"I don't know.\"  The boys fill a second cup and he asks, \"So, are you trying to tell me that you don't know what you want?  Are you a donkey?\"  They laugh and they ask him if he wants to try.  The horse gives them a choice: choose the carrot or choose the sticks.  So the boys choose the carrots, and the horse eats all of the carrots.  After they eat, the horse asks, \"So which one should I choose?\"  Each boy selects the carrot, and then the horse eats the carrot.  When asked why he took it, he says, \"Because you're a horse.\"  He then eats the sticks, and the farmer gives each boy a piece of hay.  After they eat their hay, the three boys go to see the horse again.  The horse asks the boy, \"How many of the carrots did you eat?\"  The boy replies \"One.\"  The horse is surprised and he says, \"That's all?\"  The boy replies, \"I didn't finish any.\"  The horse said, \"Then you must have wanted to.\" So the horses", "answer": "C: transistor"}

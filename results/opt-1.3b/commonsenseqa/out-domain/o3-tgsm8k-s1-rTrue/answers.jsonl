Output: $60 for each car minus the $20 dollars from every car\nIf every car in the factory came from a dealer, the dealer charges $20 for each car.

His running mate at the time was the governor of California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was known for cutting taxes.  Mr. Gore had $4.5 million in cash and owned stock worth thousands of dollars.  The election was won by a landslide with the highest popular vote in U.S. history.  President Bush was elected as President after two terms as President.  Mr. Bush began to implement a plan to eliminate the deficit and had many supporters due to their views on the environment.\nMr. Gore called him the \"climate change fool\" and predicted that he would \"not get anything done.\"  Mr. Bush is the \"climate change champion.\"\n\n In this assignment, we have to show how the two main candidates differ on how to handle the economy and how to tackle the environment.  We all know that Mr. Gore is a lot like Mr. Bush in economic policy, but where he goes off on is in his views towards climate change.  Because Al Gore was the main challenger at the time the economy was running great and people had more disposable income.  When the economy started to become depressed people decided to tighten their purse strings and they became cautious.  Many people lost their jobs and their income.  This left many unemployed and destitute.

Mark told his father to ask him what his uncle had promised and then he would pay the other $100 for his uncle's promise to put his pile of coins on the roof.\nOutput:\nMark gave $200 for his uncle's promise.  He told his uncle to put his $100 pile on the roof.\nBecause the pile of coins had an extra $100, his uncle would be paid $220 for the pile of coins.  Total: $220\nBecause he left $200 in cash and $220 in cash and $200 in cash and another $10 in change, Mark's uncle paid $320 for the coins.  Total:$320\nSince Mark left $100 in change, he wouldn't be paid.\nTherefore mark lost $80.\nHis uncle got $320 and his money was divided between his 8 children.\nTotal: $320\nBecause he used some of his savings to buy the coins, he ended up with an extra $60 he used to give his uncle more coins.  Thus he had an extra $60 on top of $320 he had before he left his uncle's house to go back to school.  His uncle divided the extra money between his 8 children.

His parents got $30 from him, his 7 year old brother got $7 each from his sisters, his 5 year old sister had $4.50 each from her parents.  The grandmother and great grandmother divided the extra money between their children.

The men could go out in the country and see each other in their car several miles away.  But they must maintain a distance of 50 miles.  The man with the girlfriend has the option of driving in the woman's car every weekend.  Or the man with the wife could drive in the woman's car on the weekend.

{"text": "A\n\nInput:A: birthday party B: grocery store C: sky D: sky E:  up in the\nOutput \"A\" is not wrong but \"B\" is the correct answer. It would be fun if he went to a store and got a balloon. At a birthday party it would be easier, if he could just find a balloon. And I would also get a birthday party where you could just get a balloon. The balloon would be extra fun if there was a store or grocery store around. You could play a \"how far\" game. So \"up\" in terms of distance or \"A\" in terms of volume is the correct answer, but \"C\" is correct because it is a grocery store. But then for a birthday party if you don't have any balloons you could just have a store. But if you don't have a store there wouldn't be one to even buy balloons. So \"C\" is correct. Then \"D\" in terms of quantity of balloons. If there were a store with balloons they would still be free! So \"D\" is correct. Then in terms of quantity \"A\" is correct. \"A\" has more volume. But \"A\" is not more far away or \"D\" is correct because it's a store. But then if \"D\" was correct it would mean there was a \"cup of balloon\" and \"D\" is incorrect because there wouldn't be a cup. Then \"A\" which has more volume is correct, whereas \"B\" is correct because there wouldn't be an up in which a balloon is attached. So \"A\" is correct, but \"B\" is correct. And if both of them are correct, then whichever one is left can go to \"B\" while \"C\" goes back to \"A\". So \"B\" would go to \"C\" and \"C\" would go back to \"A\". A has more volume than \"C\" though because that person can get it back and forth with the basket. If I am in possession of the basket and have the \"cup of balloon\", then \"C\" is left but \"D\" is left if I don't have it. \"A\" is the correct answer because it is the most common answer.\n\nInput: A: birthdays B: grocery store C:(in which the birthday girl is 7, the birthday boy is 12, the birthday brother is 6, and the birthday cousin is 4) D: birthday party E:(", "answer": "A: birthday party"}

Since there are 18 pieces left, how big an amount would you need to spend to get 24?\nOutput:24 = 1 x 6 = 1 3 x 36 = 36 pieces\nIf you had 6 pieces, you would need 48 pieces to get 24 pieces\nSo 24*6=36\nSince 24 is a smaller number, then 36 x 6 x 36 = 36\nThe sum is 36 pieces with 36 pieces remaining\nBut you need 36 pieces to get 24\nSo 24*9=36 pieces\nSince there are 36 pieces remaining, your sum of total pieces is now 36 plus 9 = 36\nThe final answer is 36\n\nInput:The child's income is $150.

Answer:  >Mac'n'Cheese  >The Mac'n'Cheese >The Mac'n Cheese\nThe Mac'n'cheese has two cheddar cheese slices on top and white sauce on the bottom.  You put the bottom 2 slices of cheese on the top and put the white sauce on the bottom side by side.  If you eat the Mac'n'Cheze the way it is eaten, you only get 1 slice of cheese.  However, if you try to eat like a \"gander,\" you get 2.\nThe mac'n'cheese is served in a square.  You bite into each square and hold it out as you eat the cheese, then you put the knife on the bottom, you put the sides together and you cut into the cheese until you get to the bottom edge which is the same as the edge of the Mac'n'cheze.\nThe Mac'n't's are served as square pizza slices. One Mac'n't contains 2 slices of cheese on top of each slice of pizza.\nThe Mac'nt's slices cannot be stacked and you have to eat each one straight away.\nYou can't cut into the Mac'n'y cheese.  When you do, you get the edge of the cheese which is the same as Mac'n't cheese.\nIf you eat the Mac'nt cheese like a \"gander\", you get the end of the Mac'n't cheese because the Mac'n't can't hold itself together.\nIf you eat it like a duck you only get 1 slice.  You first bite off the bottom 2 slices so you get 3 slices, then bite off the top 2 slices so you get 4 slices and go back down the line.  You could also eat them like a duck and eat them like that, but then you have to eat them all", "answer": "C: corner"}

{"text": "Southern plantation.  If the slave who worked on the plantation was in jail what are the consequences?\nForgive me if my questions are confusing so I hope someone will be able to answer. I think the answer is E\n\nInput: Why is it important to learn to control one's temper?  The only way to be able to work is to be able to control your temper.  What is the difference between temper and temperance?  The answer is:  Different words have different meanings, but I will explain.  The difference is in the attitude and the method of expressing oneself.  If you have a temper, you will yell and lash out at someone who is not being respectful to you.  If you have temperance and show that you are not disrespectful, you will not have a temper or lash out at someone.\nSince this sentence is from a question I am giving I hope someone might be able to answer for me. If not, I'll give you the answer by telling you one more time.  If someone has control of their temper the only way that they are going to be able to work in a position of authority is if they express their anger without using violence to get what they want. If you have temperance, you can not express your anger without using violence and a lot of people don't like that. If you have temper, control of your temper and your anger are two different things.\nIf someone has anger they should express how much they want to get their way.  If they get so frustrated, they should show that they are not angry and take the other person's temper, not their anger.  If you express it, it will be easy for that person to control and control others by using positive reinforcement. When they show that they are not using anger for you, others will see that you are being a good friend. If you express your anger and you do not take another person's control, you are going to lose control of yourself, which is worse than being angry, because it is not possible to control yourself by giving in to anger.\nThere needs to be a difference between anger and temper.  Anger is a negative feeling.  You feel it and you lash out against the one who is doing the wrong thing.  With temper, there is a positive part to it.  If you show restraint, you will be able to do things that the angry person cannot do.\nSince this sentence from a question was given in class I hope someone is able to", "answer": "E: plantation"}

What are you doing here?\"\nOutput: Zach opened the book and read the story.  The old man said, \"Wow!  You are fast reading!\"  Mark was surprised at how well he read the book.

This allowance came to a total of $11.50 per week with a parent paying 75% of his allowance every month.  Mark's allowance was only allowed to be spent on toys and video games and it was split evenly between himself and his brother.  One of his brothers had to save 20% of his allowance every week and use 30% of his allowance on themselves and Mark.  The other brother then had to save 20% for his own allowance.  After saving for months, both brothers ran out of money and their families gave them money to borrow to pay for books until their families could borrow money again.\nIn the beginning of this time in Mark's life, he didn't have much to save.  He asked his parents to borrow a few dollars so he could buy a few video games and toys he wanted.  Unfortunately his parents decided to not lend him the money for his video games and toys but instead gave him a small allowance that he had to spend on his brother's toys and games every week in order to keep up.  He never had to buy his own video games and toys and as a matter of fact, he saved up $1350 in just 5 months.\nOne day during this time when Mark was 17 Mark told his mom that he wanted to go fishing.  They weren't able to go to the lake because the government had banned fishing.  Mark said that he could fish on his own but the people who lived in the area didn't like him fishing in the lake because he wouldn't bow to their rules.  Finally, his mom let him fish there and he caught a fish worth $250.  Mark spent the money immediately on new toys and video games and he ended up using about 4 times as much as he caught in the lake.  Later that day he told his dad that he wanted to get a goldfish because it had been the highlight of his summer vacation.\nMark's biggest problem was money. He didn't have any more than $20 to save for vacation and he ran out of the money he needed to buy video games and toys to earn a little extra.  The parents of the little kid next door gave him $75 to borrow so that he could buy new toys and spend a little money on his brother.  He borrowed 6 months", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

{"text": "There is only one toilet that is available at the space shuttle launch pad in Kansas City.  We assume a space shuttle needs to stand still for 20 minutes after takeoff to prevent a long-tail rocket from hitting the shuttle's underside.  Let's guess that the toilet is inside the launch bay.  We can see from the picture that it has two toilets.  Mark is in the launch bay.  His parents wait nearby in a line of vehicles.  The astronauts stand waiting in line in this picture with the four other astronauts, one each from the United States, the Soviet Union and China.  All of the astronauts are seated and Mark is standing at the rear of the shuttle's shuttle bay.

For eight hours he cut, cut, cut and landscaped four large areas that took up most of his time today.  How many weeds did Zach cut and how many leaves were he raking out?\nOutput: For eight hours Zach cleaned 4 areas with 4 hours' work\nSince he only trimmed out weeds and raked leaves, he spent four hours working on 4 areas.  He trimmed out 4 of the weeds and 6 of the raked leaves, leaving him with 4 hours' work.  So he only used 4 hours worth of time to do 4 hours worth of work.  He spent 4 hours working on 4 areas, so he spent 4 hours = 4*4 = 4 hours worth of time.  He didn't spend 4+4=10 hours in total.\nSo he didn't waste any time = 4*4 = 112*4 = 112*8 = 112 hours in total.\nThe total time Zach spent at work today was 8 hours.  That's 4 hours worth of work in 8 hours, so it was 8 hours worth of time in 8 hours.  So total = 8 hours plus 112 = 112 hours in 112 hours worth of time.\nSo his hours were 8/72 = 28 hours.\nSo his total time at work was 112/8 = 56 hours, so it was 56 hours worth of work in 56 hours\nIn total, Zach worked 8 hours\nSo Zach spent 28 hours\nSo the answer = 56 hours = 56/8 = 56 hours\nSo Zach spent 56\n\nInput:What number of times has Mark worked for the landscaper and how many times has Mark worked for this landscaper?

This week he got $2 from babysitting.  Since babysitting is this week's activity, he got $2 for babysitting and $1.70 for eating sandwiches.\nOutput: There are three sandwiches at $1. He eats three sandwiches at $2 each. So at first he needs to be paid $2 plus $3 plus $5 and so he gets $3.70-$5=$5.70, which means he earns $0.80 for eating sandwich bread and gets $0.25 back for the $13 total that he brought to work. Therefore he gets paid $5 and has an even less incentive to keep babysitting because the only money he makes for babysitting is $1.00. He has $20 total to play with so he gets no incentive to do the babysitting even if he wants to because he could keep getting $2 for doing nothing. Therefore there is a maximum of $0.80, a minimum $0.80, and an average of $1.00 and $1.70. Therefore the final answer is $0.40\n\nThe last question required four items. It's always nice to have an extra $40 after you go to work. Good job!", "answer": "E: utility room"}

She asked her parents a couple of weeks ago if they had a vacation home.  They wanted her to go with them but Dolly said she was fine staying home.  She asked when they were returning and her father said that when they arrived they just drove home and stayed home.  She was pretty upset but her father encouraged her to stay the whole week while they were there.  Her parents are very disappointed in her.  Her parents have been trying to talk to her about taking the vacation but since she is homeschooled and they don't know much more about her, they aren't getting very far.  Dolly has been so upset and this week she has withdrawn $1,000.  She asked for $10 to buy a pack of chewing gum.  She's still not sure why she made that request.  She said she was really hungry but her mother and grandmother told her to wait until she got paid.  They both want Dolly to take the vacation and Dolly said she needed to get her money and save it for now.  So Dolly spent $1,000 and $1,000 is all she'll take out of her bank account for a month or so.  Then next month she'll withdraw 5% of her bank balance.  (She had withdrawn $1,000 from her bank account for the trip.)  By next month, she'll have $500 in her bank account and $5 of it will be available to withdraw each month.  Dolly will eventually save up $500, after she's made the trip.  She'll save up another $5 each time she withdraws, eventually having $10-$10,000 waiting in her bank account.  So the final answer is $10,000.\nOutput:\nDolly spent $11,000>$1,000>$1.000>$2,000>$10,000\nShe spent $12,000+$13,000>$13,000", "answer": "D: learn to read"}

Your uncle and aunt want you to earn money and invest it for them so they can retire later.  Your uncle spends $200 once per week.  He spends $70 on food every week and he spent $30 on exercise every week.  How many dollars will your uncle put into you each week?\nInput: Each week your uncle will give you $70. If you earn $200 and spent $70, your aunt will receive $200. Your uncle will receive $300 in total.  Your uncle spent $700 because he did not save.  If your uncle keeps on $700, that is a total of $1400 that comes to $0.\nOutput: $0 = $(0+70)(0+70)/20 = $(0+300) * $700 = $(0+700) x $700 = $(0 + 700) / $700\nIf you earn $200, $40, $80...your uncle puts $300 into you each week so you earn $200, you spend $40 and you spend $80 so you earn $80 so you have $100, which is left to invest.\nIf you earn $150 and your uncle put $200, he earns $300.\nIf you earn less than $150 and your uncle did not put $200 or $350 into you, your uncle earns $200 which is $0.  That is $0 divided by (0+180)(0+180) and then your uncle adds 0 times $200 to $200 = 0 = $(0) * $200 = $(0+0) x $200 = $(0 + 0) / $200\nIf your uncle puts $350 into you each week, your uncle earns $800 and your aunt earns $300 so they end up earning $600.  If they earned $200 each, that is $120 they invested into you.  If they did not earn $200 each, your total returns will be $200 * $60 = ($120 x $200) = $240 which is $0 divided by your uncle.\nOutput: $240 = $(0+0)*(70 - 30) = $120 * 60", "answer": "D: office supply store"}

If we add the cost of rescue to the cost of the house, how much will the child have to pay to repair the house?

Assuming that the child is willing to pay 8*8=<<8*8=64>>64, it should be no problem to determine the cost of the rescue by dividing the rescue cost by the cost of the house.

The first bed is used by his older brother who has a birthday party every Friday and wants him to sleep in.  The second bed has been used by Bobby for his older sister who has a birthday party 2 times a year who sometimes just wants her to sleep in.  What are the odds that he will use the first bed for his sister, who has a birthday party on Thursday, when she has the party she always wants and use the other bed for himself who has his birthday party on Saturday.  What are the chances that Danny will use the second bed for himself, who has his birthday party 8 days before the big party on 28 and uses the other bed for the big party on Saturday.\nOutput: Danny has the option of making the first bed his sister's.  There are a total of 29*5=<<29*5=73>>73 beds.\nBut given that Bobby's older brother will now be at the party, Bobby's older brother may instead sleep on the second bed.  Therefore the total bed count is only 89*30 = <<89-45 = 73>>73\nTherefore the total number of beds available to Bobby are 89*30 = <<79-45 = 73>>43\nOutput: Danny chose to make the first bed his sister\u2019s.  Only 41*5=<<43*5=73>>43 beds are available and so the total count is 79*5 = 75>>73\nSo 79*5 = 73*11 = 113*11 so 113 * 5 = 37\nSo the total number of beds is 37\n\nInput:Mark has 13 kangaroos & 2 goats with no kangaroos in his yard.

All of the goats and cows agree again that a sword is a better idea.  Zac again walks over and again holds out the knife and this time the goats and cows throw it away again. Zac then asks the sheep and cows what they think of the sword.  The sheep and cows all agree that a knife would make it easier to take down zombies. Zac asks a goat if a sword would make it easier to kill a person who is just being an idiot, the goat says yes. Zach has 2 minutes to reach the shelter; he decides to just keep going.

Eventually, the water warmed up and they left the lake and went back out into the woods.  They had fun there though, they were able to swim and play in the lake. A few of them cried and one girl cried so hard she threw up all over her friends.\nOutput: As long as she isn't swimming that far away from the shore she can hold back tears, but when she actually gets out into the lake she gets cold feet.  She thinks that it's a dangerous thing, she wouldn't be able to hold back crying in the ice cold water.  So she decides to go to bed instead of staying out and swimming", "answer": "D: moving"}

She needed to save $100 per dog so that's $100+$450=$500+$450=$750.  So far she has saved $400 on four dogs.\nIf she saved $100 on Saturday morning, she has $100 left over.  With her bank account up to $440, that leaves $100 to spend until the week after the dog is delivered.  She can spend this money on a new car, a trip to Hawaii, or on a new puppy.  He still has $20 left over so he has time.\nInput: Mark has 4 goats and 3 kangaroos.  He has a total of 47 goats. If he had 23 goats, how many of the goats would be of average size?  Output: His kangaroo population is 47*3=<<47*3=69>> 69 goats.\nSo his total goat population is 69*3=<<69*3=273>>273 legs.\nSo 37 goats + 69=<<37+69=320>>320 legs.\n37 goats and 69 goats are equal to 36*3=<<36*3=90>>90 legs.\n37 legs + 69 legs = <<36*3=115>>115 legs.\nSo 36*3=<<360+120>>120 legs\nThese legs are of average size so there are no more than 36 kangaroos in his yard.\n\nInput:A student is in a math class that is given an extra week of winter term to complete a term's worth of extra questions or projects.

For example, if he lives in a small one bedroom apartment and has one person to help him, the man can use the table as a seat to sit on when sitting on the floor.\nSince there are six people to sit on the table, this gives us the following problem:\nx+y = y+z where 1 < y<6 and y<=1.  This problem is solved by adding two different numbers that satisfy the formula 2<x<6 and 2<x <=1\nSo in the formula 2<(1-z)*x-1> 2<x<6x\nSo the final answer would be 6+x*(2-z) = x*+3x\n\nInput:Mary has 2 stickers, 1 on the front page of journal and 1 on the bottom of the notebook page.

Can you figure out which pages Mary took off?\nOutput: Her journal says 2 pages are blank 2 pages are blank so she put the 11 stickers on 2 blank pages.  This week she added 8 stickers to her other pages and 12 to her front page.\n\nInput:John had 10 stickers left with 4 stickers remaining.  He used 1 large sticker on his front page and 3 small stickers on each page.  In total, John had 9*4=<<9*4=17>>17 pages of his journal.  Can you determine how John divided his stickers to his other pages?\nOutput: 4 pages are blank. 8 pages are blank. So he put the 17 stickers on 4 blank pages.  This was on Sunday when his allowance was only $5.  This week he added 5 stickers to his other pages and 2 to his front page.\nOutput: Since John cut out three columns to his journal, he used 4 tabs instead of 3 tabs because he added 8 stickers to 4 blank pages.  So this week he cut 11 - 4 = 1 fewer tags per line than last week so we know that last week he used 18 tags per line since his journal was 17+17 = 32\nNow his journal is 34+1 = 31 fewer tags per line than in his last week when he put 32 tags per line so he now has 33 fewer tags per line\nSo his overall journal has 33 fewer tags per page than last week = 33 + 1 = 33\nSo his overall journal this week has 33 less tags per page, therefore his overall journal this week is 30 less tags than last week.\n\nInput: Mark was given 4 stickers for school this week, he earned $1 from helping his mom shovel in the snow.

Mark said $50 isn't enough so he will spend $75.\nOutput: 1$50 (5) $75 (5)\nHe spent $5 so he now has $5-$5 = $$5-$5 = 1$5\nSo the remaining $2 was not $5-$5 > 1$, it was $5-$5 and not 1$, so the remaining $3 was not $5-$3 > 1$, it was 1$, so the remaining amount of $3 was not $3-$3 > 1$, but it was $1, so $3-$1 and $3-$12 became 2$, so his total money was $120, so the total was $120 \u2013 120 = 2% = 2.8$\nSo now we'll try to figure out what the total of the amount we saw by adding $2 = 2 and $3 = 3.  We know Mark has 2$ so we know he spent $5.  So we'll look at a 2% amount and then 3% amounts and then 4% amounts.  If we want to check to see what the total is we can look at what was left at the end of the week which is the total 2% amount.  If the total before subtracting the 2% and 3% amounts from the remaining 2% amount is $15 at the end of the semester then Mark spent $160 on the books as of Friday or 160.25 x 40 = $280.25  So Mark spent the entire week or $280.25 on books in the first place.  When we compare the total before subtracting 2% and 3% items and the total between subtracting 2% and the sum of the 2%s and 3%s we know Mark's total was $0.25.  So the first thing we would do is look around and see if we see any $0.25 accounts or if the final balance is not $40, so the total is $0.25.\nThat's it.\nI hope you enjoyed this question and I hope you learned some things.\n\nInput: The person in charge of the library at your school has three volumes.\nOutput:  * One is full of books\n* The other two books are one", "answer": "D: further education"}

Choices:  1.  Ten centimetres  2.  Two centimetres 3.  Five centimetres\nOutput: Two Centimetres.\nInput: In order to travel for two kilometres, you will need to walk for one hour.  As you can't walk for that long in ten or two centimetres you would need to take off your shoes for four centimetres in order to do the necessary walking.  So your example is: > 2 Centimetre + 4 Centimetre = 4 Centimetre = five Centimetres  It takes one hour to walk two kilometres and one hour to walk a kilometre.\nOutput: 1 Hour x Five Centimetres= 2 Centimetres x Ten Centimetres = Ten Centimetre x 20 Centimetres = $20  So for ten Centimetres, five Centimetres, two Centimetres, four Centimetres and twenty Centimetres. So total walking is 10 centimetres-20 Centimetres= $40 for two kilometres or 10 centimetres-40 Centimetres= $60 for one kilometre.\nTotal number of metres = $40/$60 = $($<$40)$<$60 so $40 for 2km and $60 for one kilometer\n\ninput: In what year will the first case of global warming occur in the U.S.?

Therefore D earns $4 worth of quarters from his parent and has $4 left over.\nHowever, if D sleeps over at a friend's house A has 6 dollars in her pocket, and B has $6 in his pocket, and A's pocket is empty, then A will give B the extra $4 at the end of the week so B can earn a $10 paycheck (A's pocket is now empty). Therefore D earns $6 worth of quarters from B.\nB has earned a total of $10 in quarters thus earning himself 7 dollars.\nTherefore, B earned 10 from B because B's pocket is now empty. Therefore, B's paycheck will be paid out to B. Therefore, B will earn a total of $10.\n\nInput:Mary buys a new bike worth $100.  She needs $65 more before she pays for the bike.

Output: If we assume that we have a normal daily sleep-wake cycle then we can assume that we burn about 2,500 Kcal in the first hour of the day.  If we apply a 10 per cent burn rate, we burn about 14,000 Kcal in that first hour.\nWe can then divide 14,000 by 8,000 to get a total of 2,500Kcal for that day.  We can then divide 14,500 by 16,000 to get a time that includes time that we are asleep and time that we are awake.  This gives us an average of about 24 hours a day (or 6.4 hours per day).  If we adjust for body measurements (height and weight) we can then divide the total by the weight of a person to get the average calories burned per body mass.  So we can then estimate the number of kilojoules that a normal person would burn in a day by dividing the total by their weight.\n\nOutput: We've all had this problem.  You drive your car for 7 hours in rush hour, arrive home at lunchtime and take a 2 hour nap because you're tired and can't sleep properly anymore.  You find that you've burnt around 5 kilojoules in the day.  This means that you burned 5.2 calories per kilojoule.  If you then multiply your 5.2 calorie burn value by 10 then you get the total calories you'd burn in a day.  In other words you've burned the equivalent of about 5 hours worth", "answer": "A: injuries"}

Using 10,100 + 2a + 2 will be 10,200 because 10,100 - 2a = 8.8 which is 8.8a.\nNow we find the smallest sticker Mary has in her inventory.  The smallest sticker Mary has is +2a - 2a.  Mary has the following:\n0a = 1a + 2a = 7a + 2a = 15a\nSo this gives us 14 stickers left.\nUsing the above information Mary is not in the red.  Mary has 1,050 stickers in her inventory and she has an effective sticker count of 1,050 stickers.  The total sticker count is 14,100.  With 14,100 stickers left, Mary is at 11 stacks from the maximum of 25.\n\nInput: Zach has a set of rules that says for every $10 he saves he gets 30 pennies worth of food.

The best way to deter them would be to shoot a bison that weighs 300 pounds or more.  James can't pull a bison up by his shirt cuz his arms would get tired.  So he will use a cannon. Jim has two shots left in the cannon, they cost $25 each and they take 10 minutes.  He has $120 to buy the gun, so to shoot a bison he'll have $24 left in his cannon. Assuming he's using 6 shots, he'll have 24 shots remaining.  He must spend the next 10 minutes trying to get the shot off in time.\nOutput: 10/12/12 = 10/12/12 - 7/24/12 = 4/12/12\nSince Jim has 12 shots remaining, he should save $24 while he waits for a bison.  James earns $60 total.\nHe spent $60 on his cannon gun because he only needs 6 shots to shoot an ungulate.\nHe also used $24 to buy a gun because he thought $60 would get him an effective weapon that fires 10 shots.\nHe made $120 buying a gun that only takes 6 shots to take down an ungulate. He has $12 left in his gun.  Also, he would get a $12 coupon to buy a gun for $10 if he hadn't spent $12 on his gun today.

Bob has 10 years (2010) experience in carpentry while Helen only has 3 months experience.  What is the total value of their house?Output:Bob and Helen have $45,000.00 cash.  The average amount that an experienced couple has is $55,000.00.\nBob and Helen have $50,000.00 on the mortgage.  The average amount in 2009 for a married couple who has only limited experience was $27,000.00.  So the current amount of savings, $46,000 means that they have $56,000.00 in the bank.\nWhen it comes to saving a couple of thousand dollars, they\u2019d be better off not to have any savings and to pay cash. The average amount that an inexperienced couple has on their mortgage is $51,000.00 and paying cash should be the norm.\nWith such large amount, they can easily pay their house off and save more.\nIf they have $46,000.00 in savings, it will be another $20,000.00 to make over $55,000.  So on average they will save $17,000.00 and have $54,000.00 in their savings.  Bob and Helen will need $18,000.00 in expenses that would keep them a balance short.  This would keep them under $55,000.\nSo the two will need to save $22,000.00 cash and can safely use $54,000.  Therefore the couple will have an $18,000.06 surplus.  The couple will need to pay off the mortgage, buy another home, put some money into the 401K and probably put $10,000.00 into their emergency fund.  This will give them a total of $56,000.06 in savings,\nBob and Helen will need $22,000.06 to pay off their mortgage, pay cash for a down payment on another property, pay off the mortgage from their retirement savings and put money into a new emergency fund\nOn top of all that, Bob and Helen", "answer": "A: tie shoelace"}

They each throw at balls the same distance, but they are throwing with different speed.  When they first join the team, they have 10 swings at 30 seconds per swing.  They average 6 swings per inning.  Over the winter break they have increased their swings per round to 14 swings per round.  Each swing takes more time to hit, but the extra swings are worth more than the extra seconds per swing.  By the end of the season they average 13 swings per hour vs. the previous round of 8 swings per hour.  At the end of the season there was total difference in swings per round, however, Jessica's swings per hour was more than that of Mark's by nearly 100%.  Therefore, Jessica had a positive swing per hour advantage at the end of the season and Mark had a negative swing per hour advantage.\nBecause Jessica had more swings per hour than Mark, she wins, in that she averaged 32 swings per hour vs. Mark's 10 swings per hour.\nHer swing per hour advantage was worth $1,600.  Her winnings will be $100 per day.\n\nInput:  John has 5 kids under 5.  He has a friend who has 5 kids under 5, and they both have 3 kids.

If he earns $100 in one week, can he save $2 a week to make the $600 goal?  If he is already earning $300 then the total is $400. If Jack is earning $100 a week and he doesn't earn as much as he wants he will need to save $50 a week for an extra $2 or $100 a week for another $10.  How much extra money is needed if he earns $100 a week and saves $50 a week?  Note that the average savings needed for each week is $100 a week (average of $100 over 12 weeks).\nOutput: $600 x $150 = $200 = $600\nHis goal is $600. He needs to earn $200 every week if he wants a chance at the goal.\nSo the final value is $600\n\nInput:Jack is planning how to get a job. He needs a picture of a person who looks like him. Where do you think he should look for this picture? Output: Who is this guy?\nOutput: An older, slightly overweight man with a very thin mustache and long hair that doesn't match his coloring\n\nIf he finds a picture of this man, then why does he need an older man in a hat with a thin mustache and a thinning of hair if he is going to be in his 30's?\n\nInput:Jack spends the end of last week earning $50 by helping a friend move a couch, a rug, and a table. Jack has $150 in savings. What is Jack going to spend the remainder of his $50?

The next week he earns $50 by helping the friend move and he saves $50 by earning $50 by completing the task in 10 minutes\nSo he needs to save $150 every week and he only saves $50 in the first week as his job takes 10 minutes. So next week he needs to earn $50 more so he can save $50 every week. Using the idea of buying a carpet, he needs an extra $100 a week. Next week he needs to earn another $50 so he can save", "answer": "B: fall asleep"}

Where do I check to see if the family members of the other person who I'm paying might use the cellphone?

If he counted the pencil, he got 10.\nThis gave him a total of 34 + 8 + 7 = >34.\nThis is because 34 is 1/4 and that is the smallest number bigger than 4.  When he counted 34 pieces he started with a total of 34/1 = 1, and he rounded up to 34 so that the total after the 2 + 8 = 8 was the rounded number.\nWhen Bob wrote \"I took 7 to write the letter\", it gave Bob the largest total.  This is because 7 was the largest number bigger than 5.\nIf Bob wanted to have an even larger total then he could count up by 1 first, then 2 then 3 then 4, then 5, then 6, then 7 and then 8.  Then he would write 2 lines.  When he made 2 lines it would then be 2.33.  So he would have made 34 * 2.33 = 34.  When Bob wrote 7 lines, it would give him 14.\nWhen Bob wrote B he began with 7 and then went down to 7/1 = 12.

He decides, without seeing or feeling anything, that the damage is at the top of the hill by the train station.\nOutput: It's raining, John has torn clothes from his jacket and is running to the train stop with all his luggage.  He sees the plane damage, he looks for any possible damage on the hill, he tries to find a place to dry his clothes by looking around, he can't find anything, he runs to the train station to get a train and is able to watch the second plane hit the ground.  John comes back to his hotel and his clothes smell.

Which is the most reasonable answer: C: expensive, generous, D: gift buyer\nOutput, answer is D\n\nInput:Give someone you are known to buy presents for a gift or money.  What will appear in their inventory?  How many presents will they have available?  Assume a gift for 50 people.  If you buy a gift, they will have 75 gifts (50+75=50=75).  If you pay for their gifts with money (but don't ask for money back) you will have spent $75 on people's gifts.  If you gave $1000 to the person who gifted you, you will have spent $1200 of gift money.  If you gave them $3000 of your own money, you will have spent almost $500.  Suppose your gift did not cover all of their expenses and you also gave them half of what you would have paid them anyway.  How would that increase the number of presents available for them?\nOutput:75+50+75 = 75+50*50 = 75+50*150 = 75+75=150 gifts\nThe total number of gifts will be 15.\nThe total number of presents available for the person who gifted you is 75*150/(75+50)=\nThe number of presents the person gives you will be 15*150/(75+75)=10\nTherefore if your gift was a $75 gift, you still have $75 left over but you will spend $250 on presents because of the gifts you gave them for free.\nThus your gift to the person who gifted to you was $150*75=450, meaning your gift was $450 (75+50)=$900 in total\nYou spent $1000 on people's gifts.\n\nInput:What is the name of a fruit that is poisonous if you eat an entire grape?\nOutput: grapefruit\n\nInput:What animal has been in the news lately and has its food source threatened by a new government law?\nOutput: a tiger\n\nInput:What's a good trick to play on those who are very smart, but forget things and forget where things are?\nOutput: A cat can never forget where he is.\n\nInput:You can find a person with a reputation for stealing from others with the help of the following:\n- The person can only be", "answer": "B: generous"}

Their first house together cost $65,000 and they've done a lot of things together in that time.  Her husband is in his 30s.  Every morning for a year they have to drive to a mall that's less than 30 minutes away to go shopping.  In December Diana wanted $40 off her gas for her car, so she went into Walmart, got her discount and she started filling up her car.  She had $100 worth of groceries left and she was going to buy a new pair of sneakers.  She went back to the car and bought another pair.  The last time she bought sneakers was four years before.  She didn't think that the purchase would be that big, but she had one item needed with the first pair and now she went with another pair.  In total after she went to the store she had $175 worth of groceries that she would have to spend $55 to buy again.  So Diana paid $50 more than usual for two weeks and spent $55 of her own money.  The next week her husband paid for the gas, but she didn't spend the $55.  His dad gave her the money she needed since his father was out of town.  Diana spent $20 of her own money and saved $20 for her dad to make it up to her.  Diana still didn't know why she went to the store, but she knew she had left something for her father that he had said was needed.  Diana said she felt upset after the incident because she knew about the money and she didn't use it, but she had promised him she would.  In total her husband had the chance to spend 35% less than usual on groceries before going shopping.  In total her car cost 35% less than normal by using her discount and she saved 35% money by using gas instead of going to the mall.  She had $65 left after she bought the shoes, but she didn't need to use extra gas money to get to the mall.  In total her time saved was valued at $75 which she left for her father.\nOutput: Diana said that her time saved was valued between $75-$105 because she spent less time in the mall and bought what she needed and because she saved money by using an extra 20% off", "answer": "C: snoring"}

{"text": "a horse is likely to live in a stable.  We need a horse to be at least 1.5x the size of the others, so in reality, we need at least 2 horses.  We need a stable if there are more than 2 horses in the party.  To determine whether or not there are more then 2 horses, we need to know whether or not they are in stalls.  We should know where the stable is.  A race track is what you would do if you wanted to move the horses after the party.  A horse is not likely to live in a stall so the only option is a stable since the animals are separated.  If there are no horses in a stable, there should not be a barn unless it is specifically stated that some animals are housed in a barn while others live in the outdoors.  We need to know what animals are housed in which locations.  So, we need to look up a local horse racing organization that will give us a complete list of the horses housed in a given location.  Each horse gets a name, a nickname, a horse code name, and a breed.  We should add this information to each animal and divide by 3 to determine whether a horse has more than 3 legs.  We should also know the approximate size of the animals in each area.  We should also look up the population size of each area.  We can do this and make some educated guesses as to the likelihood of each location.  The more accurate the guesses, the more likely the selection will be.  We should have 3 horses with similar characteristics in these 3 areas.  We can then narrow our choices by removing animals that are in a location other than these 3 areas or horses that are more than 1/3 the size of any other horse in the area.  This way, we will know what we are looking for and hopefully have 3 to 4 horse choices.  We can then try our luck and see what we get.  The number of animals determines how many choices we get, we know that.  You can then run down the first horse you get.  Use that first horse to make more choices to determine which horses have the most likeliness of being in each location.", "answer": "D: farm yard"}

She asks the first neighbor she sees how many pieces of candy she needs.  If there are enough pieces to keep her going for the entire party she will send out a party favor bag to the first person to say the number.\nOutput: Jane counts how many pieces she needs and sends out the bag with the bagged pieces in.\nThis week Jane counted how many pieces of candy need to give out in order for her party to be a success.  Due to the fact that there were 24 pieces of candy she needed to give out, she sent out the bag with 24 pieces of candy.  She finished with 12 pieces of candy left and gave out a total of 12 pieces of candy.  The total she received from the party after she received each piece of candy was 3 pieces and 12 pieces out of 24*12=3\nThat is not an accurate answer to her question.  Since she received three pieces and 12 out of 24=<<3+12=24>>3 pieces we conclude that it should be 2.\nSo the final question is 2*3+12+3 =<<2*3+12=24>\nIn total her house received 3 pieces and 12 pieces =<<2*3=24>24 pieces.\n\nInput: A group of women will gather at one house around the lake in a nearby body of water on Halloween night.

{"text": "Walking barefoot is not very bad, but will take you longer to reach all your goals in the short term.  Walking barefoot isn't always necessary, but if you don't have any shoes with you it can be more comfortable.\n\nThe answer is A. The wet ground and water on the ground mean there is not a lot of room on one side for your legs, thus leading to higher steps, and higher risks of falling and bruising your toe.\n\nInput:  Mark is planning to spend $20 on a new car.

{"text": "They can gather food in small amount and they are able to move to new places quickly so they cannot get much energy without their needs to be covered.  They need to stay in one place at all times.\n\nTo use a real life example. Take a horse and feed him and then let him go outside and leave him out there until he decides to eat again. Then feed him again. When he eats for the third time you give him the same treats. He only wants to eat more and more every day if he is out of food, not every other day. This is called a high gainer diet. He requires constant attention and his needs are met.\nFor our example however, we can think our way around this.\nSuppose we have a horse named Marnie. She is a medium sized horse about 65-75 lbs. She eats just as much grass as the other horses. She loves being outside and playing. She is very good at riding, she has been ridden by professional riders. Marnie would eat more than just grass if we let her. She is a social horse so she needs to be around other horses. We will not only feed her some grass and other treats when we want her to eat some grass, we will also feed her a lot of water. She drinks it up. Water needs to be something the horse drinks so that it doesn't need to eat grass it doesn't want to eat. After a while she becomes lazy and will just stand there at the water trough without eating. When we try to give her more food she gets anxious and just doesn't want to eat any more. Over time she becomes too fat and cannot move when she is not being walked. She tires out and can't run as well. When this happens we are often forced to put her on a diet. On a diet she is still allowed to eat grass because the food helps her stay fit but her energy will always be limited. After she has eaten grass she can't go outside at the same times the other horses are outside anymore. We must put her in a stall so that she has no access to the grass.\nWe can come up with an example for many other animal types. Imagine a horse that is just too lazy, a horse that is too aggressive, or a horse that is just not able to handle his environment because of a disability. We would then need to feed the horse a high gain diet and keep him on a diet for his whole life. This is probably not as helpful as", "answer": "A: eat grass"}

Her parents will pay him a check for 40% of his milk yield.  Mark owns 30 cows.  He will receive a cheque for 90% of his cow's milk yield.  Mark now owns 80 cows from his previous cow herd.  He will receive the cheque for $350 per cow.  Mark and Mary have 10 cows.  Mark will receive $35 per cow.  Mark paid Mary $250 per cow.  He received an extra $50 in his cheque because she took care of the calves.  So now he has a total of $375 per cow.  Mark owns 1 cow and his parents will pay him $500 per cow.  If each cow in Mark's new cow herd produces $200, he will have 150% of his total yield.  If each cow produces $200, he'll only get $75.  So the total on his farm is $250.  Mark is looking at his cow inventory and he thinks he would like some calves. Mark wants to get 100 calves. So he takes care of their needs and he takes them on rides. This will increase their herd to 130 cows.  So Mark has 130 cows.  Mark's parents will pay him $350.  They will provide two cows for every calf.  The remaining cost of the calves will be paid for by their parents.  They will also provide the cows with hay.  Mark must buy 100 millet for each calf.  He will purchase the millet and feed them millet and hay. Mark also needs some feed for every calf. Mark will buy feed for 100 calves. In total his farm is $700. If he has 110 cows and 100 calves which means the total milk and feed should be $300 but $175 is what he spent in total his cow herd is 150.  So the total cost of a single calf is $100.  Mark has a total income of $200.  So Mark makes a profit of $100.\n\nInput:Mark's mother needs to make $150 this week to pay off her student loans.

So the harder part was dropping the object when you had only one arm.

Since a man is more powerful than an object, he can't be bent in his knees unless he raises his arms\nSince an object takes longer to move than a man, it can take a man longer to take a step.\nIn a room full of two people with two arms each, it would take a man longer to move through the room than if there was an object with one arm.  However, since moving an object takes less energy than moving a man, it takes longer for an object with one arm to move than an object with two arms.\nSince moving through the room takes energy, it would take a longer time for an object with one leg to move than an object that was moving with two legs.  Therefore, the final answer is moving objects.\nIf you only have one hand, it's harder to take a step.

Mark gives his waiter his bill and does not tip Mark. After three times when they have served Mark he becomes angry at the restaurant and storms out of the restaurant.  The waiter is so embarrassed and offended that he leaves Mark alone.  Mark later gets a second date with that same waiter at the restaurant.  Mark is happy to see her, her hair is cut the way he likes and her attitude is very different.  She does not tip him again.  But Mark does not know about this until the next time he goes over to the restaurant and when he learns that his second date is with different waiter, he storms out without tipping the waiter.

Choose any one of the following options and provide your proof. Output: A: individuals B: corporations C: the country D: the people\nOutput: A is correct.  The government takes in about $400 million from individuals and another $1200 million from corporations each year.  The two groups come out even.  The country takes in $1200 million from individuals and about $400 million from corporations.\nThe overall amount of income taxes paid annually by individuals is about $300 million, while the amount paid by corporations is almost as much, but about 70% of all the corporate taxes paid annually go into military budgets, and about 30% of military budget goes into other government activities such as law enforcement.  In total individual income taxes pay out $100 million to each person, while corporations pay in $250 million, or only about 20 cents on each dollar.\nIf the military budget is cut, less military personnel will be needed and because those armed militaries do not need millions of dollars per year salaries and benefits, they are going down in number which would cut income taxes paid to government.\nSince there is more income in military than people, the only other source of tax money would be to tax people, but if income taxes are going down then taxes on corporations would also", "answer": "A: school children"}

How many stickers would Mary have remaining on each of her two pages?\nOutput: Mary has 89*3=<<89*3=90>>90 stickers on her second page. In total, Mary has 89*3 - 3 = <<89-3=89>>89 stickers left. Since Mary started with 89 stickers she now has 89 - 3 = <<89>89 stickers left.\nSince she started off with only 89 stickers on each page and added more stickers as she worked on each page, she now has 89*3 - 1 = <<89-1=89>>89 stickers\nSo the final answer for this multiple choice question is 89*3 - 1=89\n\nInput: Mary has 89 stickers on her cover page.

She would then have 89 + 89 = 90 stickers, the total count on her journal.\nOutput: She put the stickers that were originally on page 1 and made a stack of them on page 1 that would have an increased number of stickers on page 1 than she could have had in previous periods. So she now has 89*1 = 89*1 = 89 stickers on her journal.\nShe put the stickers that were on her cover page and made a stack of those on page 2 that would have increased sticker counts over previous periods. So she has 89*2 = 89* 2 = 89 stickers on her covered journal.\nShe put each sticker on a different page and made a stack on each page that showed the correct amount of stickers to the left of the sticker.

The man paid the tax, license plate, and the $4 to the license plate holder. Now how many years does his license plate last?\nOutput: $80 per year = $<<80-4=8>>8\nThe man paid the fee, had the plates put in the car, and then paid the annual tax.

The cost of legal fees in his area are $400 an hour.  He saves $250 of his paycheck each month.  For every ten hours of work he completes he saves $50.  Since he works 30 + 30 + 10 means that he has a total of 66 hours of work each month.  He can earn up to $800 per month.  He has $1500 in savings.  He wants to buy his first house.  How much does he need to earn before he sells his current home and buys a house?\nOutput: For every 30 hours of work he completes, he saves $50 per month and $800 per month.\nSo for this week he will earn $200*30+66=$200\nFor every 50 hours he completes, he saves 50 per month and $800\nSo he will have $500 after he saves $200.\nSo he needs to earn $1000 before he can buy his first house\nSo to pay for the house the final answer is $1000-$1200 = $<<1000-$1200=42>>42\nSince the house he will buy will cost $1200 per month, his monthly budget will cover his legal fees after taxes for two years.\nSo the final number is 42+1200 = $<<42+1200=75>>75 houseshare\nSo it makes sense to spend your extra $10-$12 on food and other supplies now since he will not be able to save as much in the near future.

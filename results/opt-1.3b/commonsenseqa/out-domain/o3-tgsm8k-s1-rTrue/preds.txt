I have taught school all my life and am currently studying Education. My daughter will be graduating high school this spring with a double major in Psychology and Education. She is currently a senior at our local community college. I have 2 highschools and a two year program to attend to teach elementary school, so to say there is a lot to do for a new mom is an understatement. The hardest thing about this task has been learning to balance my time between school and work and what I see as a good balance. I will be home with my daughter this summer, which is really the only time I will have to myself. I have also found that my husband is starting to notice my stress levels, so I need a place to process and vent. I am looking for some places to start. I just completed a questionnaire and will be starting on blogs tonight.<n>It has been a tough transition trying to balance my life out and I hope to be able to find a place to share this story with others in the near future.<n><n>I'll start with a more general question. Do you feel at any point in your life you became somewhat of a homebody? Has that ever been a problem for you?<n><n>Here is my daughter reading a book. Her school is having an Easter egg hunt this week. I took her to her elementary school and she has never been this excited for a hunt in all her years here. She has been through so much these past few years and is starting her last year of highschool, so I think it is safe to say she will be enjoying her last year. I am proud of her for finding so much peace

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input:Too many people want exotic snakes.  The demand is driving what to carry them? Choices:  A: ditch B: shop C: north america D: pet shops E: outdoors<n>Output:		 The number of people who want exotic snakes are way too high.  In order to meet their demand, more snakes need to be produced.  In order to produce more snakes, we will add animals to the world population until the supply is more than the demand.<n>Input: Too many people buy exotic pets.  Which is cheaper?  Choices: A: ditch B: shopping C: pet shops E: outdoor D: south america E: outdoors<n>Output<n>If we subtract the $8 they will pay for their exotic snake and divide by their total animal count, we get $2.80.<n>Since they have 33 animals, they have 2.80 x 33 = $34<n>So the final answer value is 2.80/10 = $10<n><n>Include and subtract<n>1.6*31.4 = $13.<n>1+x1/31.4 = $39<n>30 total = $69.40<n><n>Input:You are in an auto factory. Every car in the factory is valued from $20 to $50. To get the correct price, each car must be priced differently.  To get the correct price for a $50 car, what price should YOU be given if EVERY car in the factory was sold at $20 dollars?  Output: $60 for each car minus the $20 dollars from every car<n>If every car in the factory came from a dealer, the dealer charges $20 for each car.  If not every car was from a dealer, the cheapest car would be listed at $20 whereas the most expensive car would be listed at 5 times the price given by the dealership.  Therefore, $20 must be added to all cars.<n>Input: Every car in the factory costs $20 to make. Each car requires $20 to ship. Therefore, each car must be worth $20. Your current price is $55. What change should be made to your current price of $55?  Output: Decrease your "current price" by $22*$20 = $18.33<n>10 out of 20 cars would sell for less than $10 so they must be priced at $10 to $50.  Thus, you would be given $18.33 for each car.  Therefore, subtract $18.33 from your current price of $60.<n>7 out of 14 cars would sell for $10 to $50 so they must be priced in the $10 to $50 range or else they must be priced at

Choices:  A: tiredness B: living longer C: stomach ache D: illness E: acid reflux<n>Output:		 Mark is very tired and cannot sleep well.  He has eaten breakfast and dinner as usual, but he can’t sleep long enough to fall asleep.  Since it has always been after 8 am, he wakes up as soon as he eats and can’t fall back to sleep.  His parents had made him have dinner and snack for dinner.  Since he has always had them, he doesn’t need to worry about it.  He had had 2 bowls of cereal and 2 small bags of chips and would like to have more but his parents keep telling him not to because they don’t want to make him hungry for his snack.  He thinks his parents are forcing him to eat, but he doesn't like their forced feeding style.  He wants to eat more cereal, but he just can’t.  He wants to have a snack but his parents tell him, “You can have some more cereal after dinner.”  His parents have told him that they didn’t know he had had cereal at breakfast!  This behavior isn’t normal.  He feels as though his parents don’t believe him or that they are forcing things down his throat.  This may be because he is very tired and can’t think straight.  His parents think he is getting too tired to handle everything that is going on in his life.  He is very concerned about eating too much so he asks them for help.  He’s so upset that he vomits all over their carpet.  He’d like to be able to stay up later and not feel like he’s going to throw up all night.  He’ll usually take Tylenol PM (acetaminophen) and some hot or cold tea to get him through the night, but the effects won’t last as long as he would like.  Mark doesn’t want to think of what could go wrong on his birthday.<n>This may be a good time to tell him his parents are pushing him to eat too much.  “Mark, when you are older, will you remember this and want to go back and tell us why we are doing this?”  The answer is no way!  Parents are just telling your child that they need to eat more food.  Even if that’s true, Mark can decide what he wants to eat and has already given up on taking Tylenol PM.

His running mate at the time was the governor of California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was known for cutting taxes.  Mr. Gore had $4.5 million in cash and owned stock worth thousands of dollars.  The election was won by a landslide with the highest popular vote in U.S. history.  President Bush was elected as President after two terms as President.  Mr. Bush began to implement a plan to eliminate the deficit and had many supporters due to their views on the environment.<n>Mr. Gore called him the "climate change fool" and predicted that he would "not get anything done."  Mr. Bush is the "climate change champion."<n><n> In this assignment, we have to show how the two main candidates differ on how to handle the economy and how to tackle the environment.  We all know that Mr. Gore is a lot like Mr. Bush in economic policy, but where he goes off on is in his views towards climate change.  Because Al Gore was the main challenger at the time the economy was running great and people had more disposable income.  When the economy started to become depressed people decided to tighten their purse strings and they became cautious.  Many people lost their jobs and their income.  This left many unemployed and destitute.  Mr. Gore blamed the "global warming hoax" and said that all the money would be spent on new equipment to clean up water and not on repairing destroyed

He would run out to see what was going on inside and then return with an enormous saw which would help him smash the broken pieces out of the glass.  He would then make a second trip back to the factory to continue the process.

Using the saw-hammer will allow the worker to quickly cut through the plates and continue the process quickly, however, it will be slower compared to the saw.  When the worker is done smashing the glass, he will place each shattered piece in a bag and will then use the saw to saw through the bag instead of the hammer.<n><n>Input: If the goal of a business is to increase profits for its investors, what is a "quick win"?

An outdoor classroom D.  An indoor classroom E.  A classroom with a ceiling F.  An outhouse<n>Output:  A teacher uses 17% of the electrical energy of a classroom.  You use 18% of the energy of a classroom (10% less than your teacher).  Your teacher is using 27% of the energy of his class, whereas you use 25% less than him.  An outdoor classroom uses less electricity than an indoor classroom (because the outside gets cooler).  An indoor classroom in the winter is hot, so by using less electricity, it's summer, you can use more than your teacher.  Your teacher uses more electricity than you, but not quite the amount you do.  You use as much electricity as you need to run a summer, winter and rainy class.  Your teacher's classroom needs to heat all three, so he uses 17% more electricity than you per class.<n>Input: D.  One computer, one television, one refrigerator and one washing machine. E.  Two, three, four or five computers, two, one, two, three or four or five televisions and one, two, two, three, four or two washing machines. F.  All one at a time. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)<n>Output: D.  One television, one computer, one refrigerator and one computer, one television and one refrigerator are all better choices for a classroom.  It costs more electricity per hour of classroom time to run these systems than it does to run a computer alone.  Since the appliances use more electricity to run, it costs more electricity to run each of them.  A teacher using three computers takes 17% more electricity than your teacher (you use less than your teacher).

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input:Where is a note likely to indicate a melody? Choices:  A: fridge B: a classroom C: envelope D: medical chart E: sheet music<n>Output:		 A: the fridge:<n>Since it is a musical task, the notes are likely to be on the top of the refrigerator.<n>Input: If you work in a school that has a piano and your mom comes in the lunchroom and says, "How much is this $500 desk?" which would you be more likely to get: A: $500 B: $500 C: $500<n>Output: B. The note on the fridge<n>It's possible that you would be more likely to get B after the mom said "$500 desk". It is most likely they meant $500 * $500 = $500. However, it is possible they were just asking how much they should be paying for the desk not if it was good or not.<n>Input: You are at a hotel, and you are playing cards with your fellow customers. Then an employee comes running into the room, "What's going on? Where is everyone?" A: At work B: at home C: outside in the heat E: in the hall<n>Output: B: At Home D: Out in the hallway<n>Since the employees didn't say "at Home", they didn't necessarily mean to imply that you were at work. They may have just said, "Out in the hallway." This wasn't a clear indication that you were playing cards at work.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the below multiple choice question.<n>Input: Mary has 123 stickers. After the kids put their stickers on their paper the first time, she writes on her own papers: "Put stickers where the numbers are written." How many stickers does she put on the paper after writing 123 each time?<n>Output: 123 + 42 = <<123=125.>>125 stickers on the paper<n>So if she writes every number on her paper 12 times then before she writes 123 the first time she writes something else, she makes 12 stickers, then writes 123, then 123, then 123, 123. This is how many stickers she gets the first time, after writing 123 the first time. She didn't have to do this until she made 100 stickers. She will not get 123 the first time and she definitely will not write 123 again, so it will take 100 stickers just to write 123. She will get the stickers the next time after 123. She will have 120 stickers after 120 stickers.<n>Since she had 123 stickers at the beginning of the lesson, she now has 123 stickers. She has 125-125 = <<125-125=225>>225 stickers to write on her

Choices:  A: meat grinder B: stable C: red barn D: gate E: green field<n>Output:		 Meat grinder B Green Barn<n>Let's say that he had a green pasture that was in need of more grass.  He would take it over and put his fence up because the old green pasture wasn't safe and he wanted to put extra grass on his pasture.  I know this seems crazy, but he has livestock and he needs to put food on and these animals need more pasture on their pasture for their needs.<n>Let's say that there was only one horse out.  He could put his gate up and feed all of his animals out of the barn by himself.  He would just be able to feed the animals.  There would be no gate for the herd, and I'm sure he would just keep the gate closed and feed the animals out of the pasture out of sight.  In my opinion it would be safer to have the cow go out into the field and stay out of the door since the cow would see other people and he could take better care of his livestock that way.<n>In my opinion it is much safer to let the cows and horses stay over by them as I said and maybe not the whole herd just out of sight, but it would be a better situation for their needs.  I would rather have my livestock in their pasture where they were safe in the house from the storm or I would have the cow stay in the field and stay out from the door because her herd wants to be near her and wants to keep an eye on her.<n><n>Input: There are 10 bears with 10 cubs.

One man has a girlfriend and the other man has a wife.  To have both sides happy the couple must not see each other.  The wife may see her husband 10 times per month, while the husband may see his wife 10 times per week.  The men could go out in the country and see each other in their car several miles away.  But they must maintain a distance of 50 miles.  The man with the girlfriend has the option of driving in the woman's car every weekend.  Or the man with the wife could drive in the woman's car on the weekend.  If the man with the wife is away from work at the weekend, he must return to work the next Monday.  If the man has the option to drive his wife's car every weekend, then they must live in the same house, but only when both are at home.  If they live outside the house, then they must also work outside the home.  The wife, however, could be out and about on the weekends.  She could even take her husband's car to the beach, but the husband can't drive there.  The wife must always keep the car in the garage.  This can be very difficult for the wife as she must be home to look after their home.  She must still take care of the children and also take care of the business.  The woman can take her husband's car when he is work and she could drive it in the garage, but not on the motorways.  If she does this then they will have to look after her car when he is home.

It would be fun if he went to a store and got a balloon. At a birthday party it would be easier, if he could just find a balloon. And I would also get a birthday party where you could just get a balloon. The balloon would be extra fun if there was a store or grocery store around. You could play a "how far" game. So "up" in terms of distance or "A" in terms of volume is the correct answer, but "C" is correct because it is a grocery store. But then for a birthday party if you don't have any balloons you could just have a store. But if you don't have a store there wouldn't be one to even buy balloons. So "C" is correct. Then "D" in terms of quantity of balloons. If there were a store with balloons they would still be free! So "D" is correct. Then in terms of quantity "A" is correct. "A" has more volume. But "A" is not more far away or "D" is correct because it's a store. But then if "D" was correct it would mean there was a "cup of balloon" and "D" is incorrect because there wouldn't be a cup. Then "A" which has more volume is correct, whereas "B" is correct because there wouldn't be an up in which a balloon is attached. So "A" is correct, but "B" is correct. And if both of them are correct, then whichever one is left can go to "B" while "C" goes back to "A". So "B" would go to "C" and "C" would go back to "A". A has more volume than "C" though because that person can get it back and forth with the basket. If I am in possession of the basket and have the "cup of balloon", then "C" is left but "D" is left if I don't have it. "A" is the correct answer because it is the most common answer.<n><n>Input: A: birthdays B: grocery store C:(in which the birthday girl is 7, the birthday boy is 12, the birthday brother is 6, and the birthday cousin is 4) D: birthday party E:(

You first bite off the bottom 2 slices so you get 3 slices, then bite off the top 2 slices so you get 4 slices and go back down the line.  You could also eat them like a duck and eat them like that, but then you have to eat them all

One thing to remember is that you are asking about whether two things are "different" or "equally similar."  Your question on similarity would be "what makes the difference between "different" and "equally similar"?"  These questions have some similarities.  You are asking what the similarities and differences are between two elements.  The differences are whether or not the two elements are the same.  Each element has 3 elements:   a) the thing itself (two distinct things) b) it's component parts (substance and function) c) its components (substance and parts)  All 2-4-6-8-10 - this is what makes it different than other objects.  But all three of these are just components of some larger whole, so they are not entirely unique.<n>Input: What do you think Bob is feeling when he yells "Your wallet was hacked"?<n>Output: What does the person who gave Bob the bad news think Bob is feeling?

If the slave who worked on the plantation was in jail what are the consequences?<n>Forgive me if my questions are confusing so I hope someone will be able to answer. I think the answer is E<n><n>Input: Why is it important to learn to control one's temper?  The only way to be able to work is to be able to control your temper.  What is the difference between temper and temperance?  The answer is:  Different words have different meanings, but I will explain.  The difference is in the attitude and the method of expressing oneself.  If you have a temper, you will yell and lash out at someone who is not being respectful to you.  If you have temperance and show that you are not disrespectful, you will not have a temper or lash out at someone.<n>Since this sentence is from a question I am giving I hope someone might be able to answer for me. If not, I'll give you the answer by telling you one more time.  If someone has control of their temper the only way that they are going to be able to work in a position of authority is if they express their anger without using violence to get what they want. If you have temperance, you can not express your anger without using violence and a lot of people don't like that. If you have temper, control of your temper and your anger are two different things.<n>If someone has anger they should express how much they want to get their way.  If they get so frustrated, they should show that they are not angry and take the other person's temper, not their anger.  If you express it, it will be easy for that person to control and control others by using positive reinforcement. When they show that they are not using anger for you, others will see that you are being a good friend. If you express your anger and you do not take another person's control, you are going to lose control of yourself, which is worse than being angry, because it is not possible to control yourself by giving in to anger.<n>There needs to be a difference between anger and temper.  Anger is a negative feeling.  You feel it and you lash out against the one who is doing the wrong thing.  With temper, there is a positive part to it.  If you show restraint, you will be able to do things that the angry person cannot do.<n>Since this sentence from a question was given in class I hope someone is able to

This allowance came to a total of $11.50 per week with a parent paying 75% of his allowance every month.  Mark's allowance was only allowed to be spent on toys and video games and it was split evenly between himself and his brother.  One of his brothers had to save 20% of his allowance every week and use 30% of his allowance on themselves and Mark.  The other brother then had to save 20% for his own allowance.  After saving for months, both brothers ran out of money and their families gave them money to borrow to pay for books until their families could borrow money again.<n>In the beginning of this time in Mark's life, he didn't have much to save.  He asked his parents to borrow a few dollars so he could buy a few video games and toys he wanted.  Unfortunately his parents decided to not lend him the money for his video games and toys but instead gave him a small allowance that he had to spend on his brother's toys and games every week in order to keep up.  He never had to buy his own video games and toys and as a matter of fact, he saved up $1350 in just 5 months.<n>One day during this time when Mark was 17 Mark told his mom that he wanted to go fishing.  They weren't able to go to the lake because the government had banned fishing.  Mark said that he could fish on his own but the people who lived in the area didn't like him fishing in the lake because he wouldn't bow to their rules.  Finally, his mom let him fish there and he caught a fish worth $250.  Mark spent the money immediately on new toys and video games and he ended up using about 4 times as much as he caught in the lake.  Later that day he told his dad that he wanted to get a goldfish because it had been the highlight of his summer vacation.<n>Mark's biggest problem was money. He didn't have any more than $20 to save for vacation and he ran out of the money he needed to buy video games and toys to earn a little extra.  The parents of the little kid next door gave him $75 to borrow so that he could buy new toys and spend a little money on his brother.  He borrowed 6 months

Choices:  A: bathroom B: solar system C: coffee shop D: space shuttle E: airport<n>Output:		 There is only one toilet that is available at the space shuttle launch pad in Kansas City.  We assume a space shuttle needs to stand still for 20 minutes after takeoff to prevent a long-tail rocket from hitting the shuttle's underside.  Let's guess that the toilet is inside the launch bay.  We can see from the picture that it has two toilets.  Mark is in the launch bay.  His parents wait nearby in a line of vehicles.  The astronauts stand waiting in line in this picture with the four other astronauts, one each from the United States, the Soviet Union and China.  All of the astronauts are seated and Mark is standing at the rear of the shuttle's shuttle bay.  How many feet on the ground is between the shuttle and Mark?<n>Output: Mark's parents stand behind him, so a total of 10*10+10=22*12=33<n>So Mark has 10 feet between him and the shuttle.<n><n>Input: A student wants to get a new bike for the beach.  Her mother earns $80 a week and does not want to send her student $40 extra every time she goes shopping.  Her mother needs her daughter to earn $75 a week to get that discount.  What is the easiest and least expensive way for her to help her daughter earn $75 a week?<n>Output: They buy the bike for $80 and add $20 to their mother's bill to pay them each back for their 50 percent share of the bike bill, so she will spend an extra $40.  This gives them $120.  What is the total amount they can pay her each month?<n><n>Input: When Mark was 12, he could make a car for himself on his own.  He had an old VW Bus parked in his driveway.

What made this project work?<n>Output: This car was a 1990 Volvo with all sorts of options.  All of Mark's friends had one of these cars and this was the only one in Mark's immediate neighborhood.  Anytime he took the car to the beach or anywhere else he could park in an empty lot, he was always the first car to be moved.<n><n>Input: When John walked to the store from school one recent day, he noticed

For eight hours he cut, cut, cut and landscaped four large areas that took up most of his time today.  How many weeds did Zach cut and how many leaves were he raking out?<n>Output: For eight hours Zach cleaned 4 areas with 4 hours' work<n>Since he only trimmed out weeds and raked leaves, he spent four hours working on 4 areas.  He trimmed out 4 of the weeds and 6 of the raked leaves, leaving him with 4 hours' work.  So he only used 4 hours worth of time to do 4 hours worth of work.  He spent 4 hours working on 4 areas, so he spent 4 hours = 4*4 = 4 hours worth of time.  He didn't spend 4+4=10 hours in total.<n>So he didn't waste any time = 4*4 = 112*4 = 112*8 = 112 hours in total.<n>The total time Zach spent at work today was 8 hours.  That's 4 hours worth of work in 8 hours, so it was 8 hours worth of time in 8 hours.  So total = 8 hours plus 112 = 112 hours in 112 hours worth of time.<n>So his hours were 8/72 = 28 hours.<n>So his total time at work was 112/8 = 56 hours, so it was 56 hours worth of work in 56 hours<n>In total, Zach worked 8 hours<n>So Zach spent 28 hours<n>So the answer = 56 hours = 56/8 = 56 hours<n>So Zach spent 56<n><n>Input:What number of times has Mark worked for the landscaper and how many times has Mark worked for this landscaper? [10]<n>Output: 3<n>The only thing left on Mark's landscaping job is rake leaves.  He'll work as many hours as his leaf rake allows and then give up.

Choices:  A: wishing well B: kitchen C: hardware store D: garage E: utility room<n>Output:		 The janitor got his pails from where he had them when he got up last.  He made $1.  He only had $7 to put away after he had bought the garbage bags so he didn't buy them.<n><n>Input: The janitor likes to eat sandwiches. He prefers wheat bread over wheat crackers or whole wheat bread. He eats mostly sandwich breads except special occasions when breaded pizza is served. He says, "I like to eat sandwiches with a little bit of butter on them." What is the kind of sandwich he likes? This week he got $2 from babysitting.  Since babysitting is this week's activity, he got $2 for babysitting and $1.70 for eating sandwiches.<n>Output: There are three sandwiches at $1. He eats three sandwiches at $2 each. So at first he needs to be paid $2 plus $3 plus $5 and so he gets $3.70-$5=$5.70, which means he earns $0.80 for eating sandwich bread and gets $0.25 back for the $13 total that he brought to work. Therefore he gets paid $5 and has an even less incentive to keep babysitting because the only money he makes for babysitting is $1.00. He has $20 total to play with so he gets no incentive to do the babysitting even if he wants to because he could keep getting $2 for doing nothing. Therefore there is a maximum of $0.80, a minimum $0.80, and an average of $1.00 and $1.70. Therefore the final answer is $0.40<n><n>The last question required four items. It's always nice to have an extra $40 after you go to work. Good job!

She asked her parents a couple of weeks ago if they had a vacation home.  They wanted her to go with them but Dolly said she was fine staying home.  She asked when they were returning and her father said that when they arrived they just drove home and stayed home.  She was pretty upset but her father encouraged her to stay the whole week while they were there.  Her parents are very disappointed in her.  Her parents have been trying to talk to her about taking the vacation but since she is homeschooled and they don't know much more about her, they aren't getting very far.  Dolly has been so upset and this week she has withdrawn $1,000.  She asked for $10 to buy a pack of chewing gum.  She's still not sure why she made that request.  She said she was really hungry but her mother and grandmother told her to wait until she got paid.  They both want Dolly to take the vacation and Dolly said she needed to get her money and save it for now.  So Dolly spent $1,000 and $1,000 is all she'll take out of her bank account for a month or so.  Then next month she'll withdraw 5% of her bank balance.  (She had withdrawn $1,000 from her bank account for the trip.)  By next month, she'll have $500 in her bank account and $5 of it will be available to withdraw each month.  Dolly will eventually save up $500, after she's made the trip.  She'll save up another $5 each time she withdraws, eventually having $10-$10,000 waiting in her bank account.  So the final answer is $10,000.<n>Output:<n>Dolly spent $11,000>$1,000>$1.000>$2,000>$10,000<n>She spent $12,000+$13,000>$13,000

Your uncle and aunt want you to earn money and invest it for them so they can retire later.  Your uncle spends $200 once per week.  He spends $70 on food every week and he spent $30 on exercise every week.  How many dollars will your uncle put into you each week?<n>Input: Each week your uncle will give you $70. If you earn $200 and spent $70, your aunt will receive $200. Your uncle will receive $300 in total.  Your uncle spent $700 because he did not save.  If your uncle keeps on $700, that is a total of $1400 that comes to $0.<n>Output: $0 = $(0+70)(0+70)/20 = $(0+300) * $700 = $(0+700) x $700 = $(0 + 700) / $700<n>If you earn $200, $40, $80...your uncle puts $300 into you each week so you earn $200, you spend $40 and you spend $80 so you earn $80 so you have $100, which is left to invest.<n>If you earn $150 and your uncle put $200, he earns $300.<n>If you earn less than $150 and your uncle did not put $200 or $350 into you, your uncle earns $200 which is $0.  That is $0 divided by (0+180)(0+180) and then your uncle adds 0 times $200 to $200 = 0 = $(0) * $200 = $(0+0) x $200 = $(0 + 0) / $200<n>If your uncle puts $350 into you each week, your uncle earns $800 and your aunt earns $300 so they end up earning $600.  If they earned $200 each, that is $120 they invested into you.  If they did not earn $200 each, your total returns will be $200 * $60 = ($120 x $200) = $240 which is $0 divided by your uncle.<n>Output: $240 = $(0+0)*(70 - 30) = $120 * 60

Choices:  A: south pacific B: sea world C: pacific ocean D: indian ocean E: gulf of mexico<n>Output:		 Shark tunnel is located in the south pacific ocean at a depth of 20,000 ft.<n>In the southeast part of the shark tunnel there is a shark exhibit that uses sharks to demonstrate animal behavior (such as chasing fish).  If a shark enters the shark tunnel it will go about 30 ft straight down, then stop, look and then go about 50 ft straight down.  There are 1,400 total shark exhibits in the shark tunnel, and the shark exhibit near the entrance to the shark tunnel is always full.  One of the Shark Train exhibits uses a shark as a model for teaching shark behavior to school children and to raise awareness of shark research.<n>If we walk down the right side of the shark tunnel we will hear the sound of the ocean from the tunnel.  The sharks move very slow and we cannot see them.  The Shark Train ride is at the entrance to the shark exhibit and is one of the shorter ride experiences in the shark tunnel.  It is on the right side of the tunnel.  It is 10 minutes long and costs $12 to enter.  The train ride is located near the shark attraction.  Every 20 minutes, about 100 sharks come in to the shark exhibit from the Shark Tunnel.  If we walk back toward the front, we will see a giant shark tunnel shark that can sit up and take a nap.  It is located near the Shark Tunnel exit sign at the end of the tunnel.  We can walk back toward the tunnel to enter the Shark Train.<n>When entering the tunnel, there is a glass panel that tells the shark exhibit shark to “Watch your step.”  This is one of the signs near where it takes a nap.<n>When we enter the tunnel, a shark walks along the center of the tunnel and a shark trainer comes into the tunnel and asks a child to take the shark’s leash so he can pet it.  The trainer then walks behind the child to pet the shark.<n>When we enter into Shark Train ride, we will hear the sounds of the ocean as we travel along the shark tunnel.  There are seven tracks down the center of the shark tunnel.  Our train’s driver goes round and round and goes to the side of the shark tunnel near the “Watch your step” sign on the shark tunnel glass for about 15 seconds (this is before the start of each train trip).  The train stops three times and the ride goes another 15 seconds.  Each trip costs $10 USD.

The child is not expected to survive.  What is the initial cost the child will pay to fix the house?  What is the final cost the child will pay?<n>Input: X was the number of adults at the fire.  If we add the cost of rescue to the cost of the house, how much will the child have to pay to repair the house? (This part of the question is tricky because X could just as easily be an integer value)<n>Output: If the child is 8 years old, he will owe $1,000.00 on top of the $5000.00 he is already liable to pay. There will be a cost of 8*4=<<4*6=8>>8<n>As you can see this is a complex question, it is not clear how to determine how much the child will have to pay.  Therefore i have decided to make it a multilateral trade.  Suppose we have Y, Z, and B.  Lets assume that the child can afford X, we will take Z.  Assuming that the child is willing to pay 8*8=<<8*8=64>>64, it should be no problem to determine the cost of the rescue by dividing the rescue cost by the cost of the house.  Let S=<<S=864>>12=<<S+864=15>>15 =<$864+$15=16>>16<n>Since there is not enough information to determine how much the rescue should cost, I am going to have to do a trade with X and Z.

Choices:  A: nice feeling B: good karma C: respect D: new freedom E: good heart<n>Output:		 If I forgive, I am giving myself a choice: a kind gesture to help someone  is an act of charity  is an act of self-delusion  is a choice that will not help me  is an act of hypocrisy  is a choice that can change my mind - for the better  is a choice that feels good<n>If I do not forgive, it will feel good to hurt myself, but it won't change anything about my life.<n>What is my choice? If I do not forgive, then why am I still here?  If I do forgive I will change my mind and my life will be good.  I can choose to forgive.<n><n>Input:<n>If I am forgiving, how long will it take for the feelings to go away? What kind of feelings?<n>Output: How long do we spend being anxious about things that we can't control? What kind of feelings would I be anxious about if I were to try and forgive someone?<n>If I forgive, I might think they are in a better mood.  But what if their mood is already better?  If I don't forgive, I might get very bad thoughts about them.  What if I forgive them anyway, then I might think they are still mean to me?  Is this what you want?  If you didn't want bad thoughts that bad, why don't you try and forgive them?  If you forgive them anyway then the good thoughts may come even more later.<n>If we could make someone like you who's always angry happy, wouldn't we do it in a second? And why don't people want to do that?<n>I don't suppose that this is a decision that is easy to make, but in the end you get back what you give out.<n><n>Input: If I don't forgive someone for something and instead continue to hurt them I will have lost my ability to forgive, how can I change my behavior to change the situation and be forgiven? What do I have to gain by forgiving?<n>Output: What does it mean to forgive? How can you change your behavior to change the situation?  When someone forgives someone else they trust that person will be forgiving them.  If they trust someone to forgive them then they will be forgiving them in kind.  Therefore when someone forgives someone another person feels more trustworthy that this person.  To get this trust you must give another person an opportunity to earn it.  If you deny them this chance then they will have lost their trust

All the family went with him to show their support.  They all had a good time and that night, while enjoying the fireworks, he went and found the nearest road.<n>The man found a good road and on this day he started his adventure.  There were only two other cars on this road so there was plenty of room.  He took his time, carefully going onto the road as it was.<n>It didn't take long for the man to get down to a smooth road for the trip.  His son could now follow behind his dad.<n>The little boy was excited and was happy to see how much Daddy came up the hill. They all cheered from the top of the road.<n>Herman had a great time as well.  He got to meet the new moon, but it was way up in the sky!<n>After Herman had gotten down to the little boy's level, he began to climb up the road.<n>The little boy got scared but he said "It's okay.  You're Dad can catch up!"  The little boy said that Herman "stumbled" down the road.  Herman didn't think this was right.  "Who is going to take care of my son and his home and what am I going to do?"  Herman decided that he would take care of himself.  He knew how to climb the hill just as well as he knew how to drive down it - he had done it many times before.  He sat down on the bench and thought about his decision for a while.  "Why me?  Shouldn't I pass this torch on to someone else" He said quietly.  Herman decided to keep going up the road.  He didn't know if he had anything better to do with his life.<n>At this point, he had not seen anything on both sides of the road.

Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n>Output:		 If you sell a dozen beer cans from the shelf outside your car for $5.00 each, you will earn $3 in sales tax dollars.  That is, $3.00 + $10 = $5.00<n>In fact you will not earn $5 by selling beer.  You already have $3 to spend on beer.<n>If the store charges you 5$ for a can of beer then $5 + $10 = $0.  Therefore, selling beer can only be a net gain, meaning that selling beer is the equivalent of buying beer.<n><n>Input: What is the sum total of the time it will take to make a million dollars?<n>Output: Let's assume there will be only 100 million people.  In order to find the time to make a million dollars, divide 100 by 100 = 200.  So the time to make a millionaire is 200*200=$200.  This means that it will take 2^20 hours to make a million dollars.<n>Input: Let's assume there is only 1 day in the year and that there will be 100 million people.  How long would it take to go to work for that day?<n>Output: So the time it would take to go to work is: 1.6 seconds/person<n>Input: There are 100 million people in the world, so to determine how long it will be until there are 100 million people working, divide the number of humans by 100 = 100/100 = 1.6<n>Output: Thus it will take 1.6 seconds/human in order to reach 100 million humans working hard<n>Input: So it will take 200 seconds/human in order for humanity to progress to 100 million working humans<n>Output: Thus there will be 100 million humans working hard every hour<n>Input: So it takes 200 seconds/hour in order to go to work<n>Output: So it would take 2^20 hours in order to earn 1 million dollars.<n>Input 2: It would take 2^20 minutes to travel to work from your house.<n>Output 2: So it would take 20 minutes in order to walk across town and go to work for 100 million people.<n>Input 3: It would take 1 minute in order to make two phone calls if you only have one phone.<n>Output 3: Thus it will take 2.02 minutes in order to call two people.<n>Input 4: It will take 2 minutes in order to send a text message.<n>Output 4: Thus it will take 4.02 minutes

When he yells one of the following and there are 5 other members of the branch he yells: 'Mark'!<n>'Owner'!<n>'Foot'!  'Subordinate'!!<n>'Base'!!<n>And when he yells, he yells: 'Point!'<n>'Point!'!<n>Assume each word Mark yells is a letter.  Which word he yells when?<n>Input:  Mark had 9 items in his bag.  He removed 6 items and took the last item.  When he was asked if he could put his last item in his bag, he said he couldn't leave all 6 items in the bag and asked if he could take the last item.  Can you figure out what item he removed and for how long?<n>Output:  He can't put the last item in his bag for 6 months.<n>We learned that the word Mark can't put in his bag is 'leaves.'<n>What was the item he removed? We can only guess at this because we had no idea what the last item was.<n>Assume Mark always wears a watch.  Now we have a list of every single watch that he has.  Can you figure for how long every watch lasts?<n>Output:  Mark's watch lasts 6 months.<n>If Mark put his watch in his bag for 6 days, it will last 6 months.  If he puts his watch in his bag every night, it will last 6 days.  If he keeps it in his room for 6 days, it'll last 6 months.  And if he keeps it in his bedside table for 6 nights it'll last 6 months - or about 2 months.  So we can predict that his watch will last 16 weeks.<n>So the final question was what time will Mark's watch last when he takes it out to put it in the bag?<n>Input:  Each time Mark takes out the watch he puts it in the bag and puts in his bag and puts it in his bag.<n>Output:  1*9*6 = 16*6 = 36 minutes<n>So in total he puts in and takes out 2 watches every day<n>It's the time of day that we have two watches in the first place and we have 4 watches in the second place.

He just paid $0.<n>In $10 - $20, Mark had to buy the latest fashion $10, $10, $10 and $20 because he cannot leave town at the end of the week.<n>So the final budget for the week is 20 - $10 + 10 - $10 + $20 = $0<n>In $10 + $20, Mark had $10 to spend which was the same as in $0.

How much of a discount does Mark get for his new outfit purchase? A: 35% B: 35% C: 75% D: $95<n>The discount is 25% as Mark does go bowling a lot and also does go shopping for an outfit for his teacher.  So he gets 50% off since he went shopping with money that he didn't earn.<n>The discount is 55% since he went to the movies also.  Because he goes to the movies often, he pays a different price to see the movie so the discount is 55%.<n>The discount is 75% since he did not leave town at the end the week so he had $50 left.<n>In fact, you cannot earn money until you leave town.  The next time

Choices:  A: good health B: finger C: meat D: body E: own family<n>Output:		 The onions were chopped and fresh garlic was added and peeled.  The onions and the garlic were cooked separately in separate pans/pots.  The onions and garlic were placed in two different pans and one of the pans was placed on a sauce pan of water that also contained salt, pepper, and honey.  The onions/garlic were then simmered in a cup of water for 5 minutes.  The pan of water was placed on the stove top with low heat and the onions/garlic were cooked through by stirring occasionally (this was done to prevent burning).  The pan of water then had a 10-minute cooling period.  When the cooling period was over, the onions/garlic was placed where to be served and in its own container.  The cooked onions were placed in a single container for serving which later was heated up on the stove top and the garlic was added.  The cooked onions and garlic was then placed onto the plate and the garlic was added with a knife.  It was taken to another table where a tablecloth with napkins were placed next to the plate.  Both sets of cut sides were then picked up and served with fresh crustola.  The cooked onions should then be served on a plate with the cut side facing up from the serving dish and there should be at least 1 bite of cooked side before the serving dish is emptied into another.  The cut side should now be removed and placed on the serving plate.  Both cut sides should then be picked of the serving plate and should be replaced with fresh crustola.<n>This method was not used.

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input:WHat leads to someone's death when they are very depressed? Choices:  A: suicide B: overdosing C: sadness D: murder E: cyanide<n>Output:		 Death will begin when a person starts feeling helpless/depressing.  Suicide leads to loss of motivation/confidence/joy/etc.  Overdose and depression do not result in murder.  They lead a person to a state of helplessness, where they are either not capable or they cannot act with a plan.  This leads to a person feeling hopeless and/or incapable of taking care of themselves.  Murder (usually by one's family) doesn't lead to helplessness or depression but instead leads to a person becoming hopeless and helplessly killing themselves.<n>So in this case the answer is no.<n><n>Input: What is the best way to save $100?<n>Output: Pay $5 to the dollar.<n>With your remaining $29, you will have $54.  Pay $3 to the dollar to save $10.  Pay $3.50 to the dollar to save the other $10.  Pay the remaining $5 to $10 to balance the total amount of money left.  Since the total is 55, you will have $55 * 56 = $107.<n>Since 55 = 57, $5 * 57 = $107.6<n>Since the total is 56, your final answer is 55<n><n>Input: Mark can choose 20 of his neighbors to be able to buy a bike.  They can choose 15 to be able to buy 1.  If Mark wants to buy 5 more neighbors, 5 people must make up the difference in $11.<n>Output: Mark wants to buy 5 neighbors + 15 neighbors + 15 people = 30 neighbors + 30 people = 60 neighbors.<n>Since Mark wants to buy 60 neighbors + 30 neighbors, 5 more people must buy up the difference of $11.<n>So the final number to round off the number of $100s that Mark receives is 62<n><n>Input: How many pennies can you get from one penny?<n>Output: Three pennies<n><n>Input: What makes a $1 coin worth more than two pennies?<n>Output: A dollar coin is worth three cents if they are both stuck together.  If they aren't, one dollar coin is worth two pennies if they are both separated or both are split apart.<n>Since 2 pennies do not have a coin stuck together with them, one penny is worth one penny -1 coin -3 pennies = 1 pennies<n>Since there are 5 pennies, one penny is worth 2 pennies -4 penny = 4 pennies<n>Since 2 pennies share a

Choices:  A: admiration B: applaud C: make reservations D: experience E: sleep<n>Output:		 admiration<n>He saw the show many times before and as the crowd watched the people standing on the front row he looked over at the stage and recognized where the actors had worked before.  They were from around the country. He could hardly contain himself when his father shouted out that they were from America and he realized that they didn't have any mics.  He said that they would sing and dance.  He then thought about how impressed he would be. That was the last night, and to him it gave him a glimpse inside what the play would be.<n>So that was his view of the show but what if he did get to hear some of the actors perform?

He put money down to get the ticket price.<n>As the curtain went down again Zach came out of the dressing room and saw everyone had left.  He had forgotten to put money down to make sure that the play cost as much as he said it did.  He thought that it would be better to stay on the grass and make some money.  He then thought it would be a good idea to sit in an audience seat at the back and buy $10.50 worth of tickets.  By the time he got home he realized that he did not earn enough money to buy tickets.  His father said that he left so early, and he was going to work on his homework.  He could not afford to spend money if he didn't earn enough money and it

The more lanes and the higher the traffic volume there will be.<n>The graph is really useful to all drivers who drive on expressways.  When a person is coming through your town and their car is loaded with people then their lane will be in much shorter traffic.  Your town will take a long time before their lane gets full and their car starts weaving in and out.  Sometimes the cars on your expressway will get there in a few minutes. The person in the front of you always slows down because there are people in the cars behind them and they don’t want to share the lanes.  Most often someone will get there in less than ten minutes.<n><n>Input: Mark lives in a small town. There is a new Wal-Mart about a mile away.  One day there will be a construction crew digging up the road. The project will take several months. There will be lots of noise and people in Mark’s house will be annoyed about it. Will his parents give him an allowance and give him two extra hours to do chores?<n>Output: Yes and No<n>If he gets an allowance and works 40 hours at the old job the amount of time he will need to do chores does not change.<n>If he gets an extra hour of babysitting but he does not work at the old job and has the extra time he should mow the lawn during that extra hour.<n>His parents will also get paid for babysitting.  If they give him 2 hours of extra time he should mop the floors in his room<n>His parents will still be paid if they give him $5.00.  If they give Mark $10.00 an extra hour will need to get 2**10*10=100,000<n>This shows that his new babysitting job takes 2**10**3/2 = 50,000 hrs of his time<n>This means that if Mark gets an additional 2 hours of work per week, he will have to spend 50,000

Choices:  A: sitting down B: refusing C: saving money D: sit down E: go outdoors<n>Output:		He wanted to take a bus because all the chars were full except for one char which is empty. So he can save $5 every day if he takes the bus by riding it a half hour less than he did before.<n>Input: Mark is working at McDonalds. He makes $5 per week.  Because he was making $5 per week and was spending $5 per day on stuff like movies and food, he decided he needed to save something.  He decided that he needed to save $5 every day for the next two months to make a total of two months worth of his $5 per week.<n>Output: After he saved $5 per day for two months, he saved $10 each month.

His father could buy him a shirt for ten cents but if he gets a dog for twenty cents then his father will only have to buy 10 shirts a day.  Mark asked his dad for a dog but his dad said the dog had to be a service dog and Mark could not make him a service dog.  Mark's brother could make a better dog than Mark could and his brother asked his dad about it.  Mark's brother told his dad that he was planning on buying a service dog for his dog but the dog was too old and the dog would cost more than his allowance.

They told him that he could build his own home and it would cost him nothing, and Mark's uncle was a graphic designer who could make websites.  Mark's youngest brother told his dad that they didn't have an allowance so he would need $20 a week for the dog.  Mark's dad said that they would need $40 a week for both of them if they want a service dog.  Because these are their own homes he can build a home and not need to pay to get a dog to do him a favor.  Mark's dad says that it is his house and he could do whatever he wants in it.  However, he can't do anything with the dog that he isn't allowed to do with his sons.  Mark's dad tells him not to be greedy and that the dog he gets is for him and he isn't going to change his mind about that.

Maybe hills are named differently, the hole itself might not be a hole, there might be a different name for the plain (ie hill) or maybe there is even a separate term for the plain, the hill, the gorge, the sandplain or even the mountain.  But in this case hills do indeed resemble holes<n>Output: The holes appear to be different sized.<n>You gave Sam an option for the size based on the answer choice, he gave the size that the holes were in.  He forgot the option for another possible answer, so your answer could in fact be hill, gorge, sandplain or mountain.<n>Input:  Sam discovered a giant hole in the  Plain.

The path that he is forced to take runs for quite a substantial distance on the  Mountain's bottom, so that there must be some other reason why the path is this short.

The way that he ends up having to travel to get to where Sam is is by going uphill...yet he can't go any further because of the massive hole<n>Output:  The mountain, the giant hole and also the giant gap are all giant gaps that happen to be the same size.<n>Input:  There was only one hole for Sam to discover.<n>Output:  the way that Sam ends up discovering the giant holes  there is no giant gap in the mountain.<n><n>Input: Sam found a huge hole in the  Plain near his house.  Sam has to carry rocks and other things home to make a home.  The hole is large and the rock he needs to move to create a small hole also has a big hole in the top

If he were closer he would have been close enough to walk in, but there was a teacher in the classroom.  If he were close enough he would have also been close enough to find the key to the locked car which he did not have.  If he had been given a ride in the first car he could have gone in.  So he would have walked if he were not close enough to get to the second car.  If he had not tried to get in the first car he would have been close to the teacher who might have let him in if he were close enough.  If the other two cars could not get into the unlocked car he would have been closer than they were.

His plan is to spend $50 on the books.  Mark said $50 isn't enough so he will spend $75.<n>Output: 1$50 (5) $75 (5)<n>He spent $5 so he now has $5-$5 = $$5-$5 = 1$5<n>So the remaining $2 was not $5-$5 > 1$, it was $5-$5 and not 1$, so the remaining $3 was not $5-$3 > 1$, it was 1$, so the remaining amount of $3 was not $3-$3 > 1$, but it was $1, so $3-$1 and $3-$12 became 2$, so his total money was $120, so the total was $120 – 120 = 2% = 2.8$<n>So now we'll try to figure out what the total of the amount we saw by adding $2 = 2 and $3 = 3.  We know Mark has 2$ so we know he spent $5.  So we'll look at a 2% amount and then 3% amounts and then 4% amounts.  If we want to check to see what the total is we can look at what was left at the end of the week which is the total 2% amount.  If the total before subtracting the 2% and 3% amounts from the remaining 2% amount is $15 at the end of the semester then Mark spent $160 on the books as of Friday or 160.25 x 40 = $280.25  So Mark spent the entire week or $280.25 on books in the first place.  When we compare the total before subtracting 2% and 3% items and the total between subtracting 2% and the sum of the 2%s and 3%s we know Mark's total was $0.25.  So the first thing we would do is look around and see if we see any $0.25 accounts or if the final balance is not $40, so the total is $0.25.<n>That's it.<n>I hope you enjoyed this question and I hope you learned some things.<n><n>Input: The person in charge of the library at your school has three volumes.<n>Output:  * One is full of books<n>* The other two books are one

When they have the extra $5,000, how much of a difference can they make in their monthly payments?<n>Output:<n>The payments are $5,000/8= $5,625 every eight weeks.<n>So $5,625 x 8 weeks = $22.25 per week<n>The extra $5,625 = $16.25 each week<n>So by using the same method as before we can find the amount of money needed for a down payment<n>So their total interest savings this week is $14,025 in 4 payments<n>The additional down payment for the down payment of $8,000 = $8,500 this week<n>So the final cost for the down payment of the house is $20,025 in 4 payments of $16,125 each<n>So the final cost of the down payment for the house is $55,175 per house<n>So the total cost of the house is $5525/40 = $44,225<n>So the final cost is $18,075<n>Thus their total expenses are $44,225<n>In 4 payment of $16,125, they make $3675 in 8 payments of $16,000 each<n>Thus their total expenses this week is $3825 divided by 8 payments = $1725<n>So our total saved is $1275 in 8 payments of total $1725<n>The extra $1275 in 8 payment = $1525<n>So our total savings is $1175 in 8 payments of 1725<n>So by using the method of before we can find the cost of the house<n>So our cost of the house on the first payment is $2675 divided by 8 payments = 4,625<n>Thus the total cost of the first house on the first month is $2675 divided<n>The total cost of the house on each payment is $2675<n>Thus in total the total cost of the houses is $2725 divided by 4,625<n>Multiply the total cost of both houses by the number of payments

She knows it's true, but her mother has always told her that every dog is different and shouldn't be compared. Her mother continues to ask her why she doesn't want to take her dog home. The girl answers by saying that she has had dogs her whole life, like she has the right. Her mother continues to yell at her to bring in some food to feed the dog or she has to go home and never bring that dog home in the first place. Her mother takes her daughter to where her dog has just come from and she looks at her dog with tears on her face. She then tells the girl about how her neighbor is so loud on his dogs and that it hurts her ears. She also tells her that her dog doesn't eat up food. Her dog looks at her mom and asks how she knows. Her mom tells him again and again that all dogs are different and should not be compared. The girl starts to cry and goes to the dog and sits down in front of it and says that she knows that the dog sounds horrible and how bad they are to people but she doesn't care.

Choices:  A: injuries B: fatigue C: traffic jams D: tired E: accidents<n>Output:		 Choices A + B = A + C + D + E = A + B + D + E = +0.5 -0.5<n>In each of the question above we added the 5 bonus points that Mark received for babysitting his nephew to the total number of bonus points that he received by driving recklessly.  This equals a total of 1.25 points.<n>So we added one point = 0.25 to each of the 3 question above<n>If he had used all the bonus points from driving reckless then he would have an overall score of +0.5<n>In other words he will not have 100 points.<n>If he had used 0.25 bonus points from driving recklessly then his score would be +0.5.<n>In other words the overall score will be +0.5<n><n>Input: What is the number of calories per 10kg body mass that we can expect to burn in a day?  Output: If we assume that we have a normal daily sleep-wake cycle then we can assume that we burn about 2,500 Kcal in the first hour of the day.  If we apply a 10 per cent burn rate, we burn about 14,000 Kcal in that first hour.<n>We can then divide 14,000 by 8,000 to get a total of 2,500Kcal for that day.  We can then divide 14,500 by 16,000 to get a time that includes time that we are asleep and time that we are awake.  This gives us an average of about 24 hours a day (or 6.4 hours per day).  If we adjust for body measurements (height and weight) we can then divide the total by the weight of a person to get the average calories burned per body mass.  So we can then estimate the number of kilojoules that a normal person would burn in a day by dividing the total by their weight.<n><n>Output: We've all had this problem.  You drive your car for 7 hours in rush hour, arrive home at lunchtime and take a 2 hour nap because you're tired and can't sleep properly anymore.  You find that you've burnt around 5 kilojoules in the day.  This means that you burned 5.2 calories per kilojoule.  If you then multiply your 5.2 calorie burn value by 10 then you get the total calories you'd burn in a day.  In other words you've burned the equivalent of about 5 hours worth

She said to work his normal 40 hour weeks for a couple of months as a way to save up for college.  So Jeff did just that and by the time he was a senior he paid off his loans.  His parents later told both of them that Jeff never would have learned anything about money had they helped him out and helped him get the loans.  They also advised him not to waste time worrying about stuff like this in the future and that they wished they had never called him.  They agreed to let him take the money back when he had accumulated enough money to buy something at his favorite department store.<n>Output:Jeff paid off his student loans and now has $3,000 left.

Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n>Output:		 B, C, D and E<n>We know that Daniel is thinking about suing the school district, so he's thinking "complications." But as we know that he likes helping others and he has more than 3,000 hours clocked in volunteering, so he might think along the lines of "tiredness." The school district probably won't want to incur the costs of a trial, so he probably wouldn't think of the costs when putting together an action plan. However, he's definitely thinking about what he should do so that he knows what he wants to do, so he thought about all of these options and decided to move towards a trial.<n>As we find out about his plan for this action, we know that it isn't what he wanted to do. He's not sure exactly why he wants to sue. But he's confident that he'll be successful so he will keep trying. He really wants to take a stand against the bullying that his son is getting, so he is making a stand against it. This is why he is taking action.<n><n>Input:What does a large amount of money symbolize? Output: $1,000,000<n>In general, large amounts of money symbolize the amount of money that was needed for a project. When a large amount of money is required to get a product done, the product may not be done or may take multiple times as long as if the process were cheaper. For example, if we build a $100,000 house and we need $10,000 of money, the project may take 2½ years and if we were to use the same contractor who did the work during the previous two years to do the work in a 2:1 ratio he would charge $5,000, not $10,000<n>However, we do not yet know what the costs of the lawsuit would be. We also cannot assume that Daniel knew that the lawsuit would take this long. He may have started this action when he knew the fees would be more than the project cost.<n><n>Input:In a business there is a limit to what one can make.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input:If electrical equipment won't power on, what connection should be checked? Choices:  A: company B: telephone netwok C: airport D: wires E: freeway<n>Output:		Electrical equipment won't power on and he can't do anything about it.  We shall have to wait for another power failure.  No phone, no airport, and no power.  The freeway doesn't exist anymore.  There are no wires for it.  Therefore he's stuck doing nothing but riding his bicycle to school.<n>Since his electrical equipment won't power up, he is stuck for 2 hours.  However if he leaves the engine running with the headlights on (or vice versa), he can sleep.<n>Since he has a bicycle he can still ride to school, so he's not stuck.<n>Since he can use his engine to light his bike he can sleep.<n><n>In the above questions, we were given only three items to work with.  Mark would need to change the way he solves problems, change his method of calculating, and think outside the box.  For his paper, it looks like all Mark has to do is follow the pattern and memorize the answers.  That's not necessarily true.  If Mark couldn't solve the problems or memorized the answers in order to answer the questions asked in the papers, Mark could fail.<n><n>There have been many ways people have learned to solve these types of questions.  One method which worked for Mark his Senior Year of high school was just to memorize the answers. I worked with Mark in the past and that was the way he was able to complete those papers. However, if there is a more creative method, maybe we can learn from that.<n><n>If anything, one could argue that there are no answers to these questions because there can't be either. Each one is unique.  Therefore there has to be an answer to every question.  That is what I am trying to find out here on this blog site.  When I first started working on this I thought these problems were interesting.  When I first realized that there were no answers for these types of questions, that's when I thought things weren't interesting enough.<n><n>If you have any tips about methods of using the computer to do these type of problems, I want to hear from you in the comments section.  I am not interested in being discouraged through this method.  In fact, I think it's fun to work with someone about solving these types of problems.  Perhaps it is more than that.  But I see this discussion as one of the most interesting activities a person can get involved in.<n><n>My next blog post is supposed to

It was overkill.  What did he shoot at? Choices:  A: body armor B: ungulate C: bomber D: kill people E: animal<n>Output:		 Jim shot an ungulate.  He won't die, but he probably won't win for long since they are all armed.  But he will give them a lot of pain.  The best way to deter them would be to shoot a bison that weighs 300 pounds or more.  James can't pull a bison up by his shirt cuz his arms would get tired.  So he will use a cannon. Jim has two shots left in the cannon, they cost $25 each and they take 10 minutes.  He has $120 to buy the gun, so to shoot a bison he'll have $24 left in his cannon. Assuming he's using 6 shots, he'll have 24 shots remaining.  He must spend the next 10 minutes trying to get the shot off in time.<n>Output: 10/12/12 = 10/12/12 - 7/24/12 = 4/12/12<n>Since Jim has 12 shots remaining, he should save $24 while he waits for a bison.  James earns $60 total.<n>He spent $60 on his cannon gun because he only needs 6 shots to shoot an ungulate.<n>He also used $24 to buy a gun because he thought $60 would get him an effective weapon that fires 10 shots.<n>He made $120 buying a gun that only takes 6 shots to take down an ungulate. He has $12 left in his gun.  Also, he would get a $12 coupon to buy a gun for $10 if he hadn't spent $12 on his gun today.  The average person would earn $60 and he would also earn $100 for using the gun<n><n>Input:Mary has to fill out a prescription for a new cat.  The cost is $25.

Bob has 10 years (2010) experience in carpentry while Helen only has 3 months experience.  What is the total value of their house?Output:Bob and Helen have $45,000.00 cash.  The average amount that an experienced couple has is $55,000.00.<n>Bob and Helen have $50,000.00 on the mortgage.  The average amount in 2009 for a married couple who has only limited experience was $27,000.00.  So the current amount of savings, $46,000 means that they have $56,000.00 in the bank.<n>When it comes to saving a couple of thousand dollars, they’d be better off not to have any savings and to pay cash. The average amount that an inexperienced couple has on their mortgage is $51,000.00 and paying cash should be the norm.<n>With such large amount, they can easily pay their house off and save more.<n>If they have $46,000.00 in savings, it will be another $20,000.00 to make over $55,000.  So on average they will save $17,000.00 and have $54,000.00 in their savings.  Bob and Helen will need $18,000.00 in expenses that would keep them a balance short.  This would keep them under $55,000.<n>So the two will need to save $22,000.00 cash and can safely use $54,000.  Therefore the couple will have an $18,000.06 surplus.  The couple will need to pay off the mortgage, buy another home, put some money into the 401K and probably put $10,000.00 into their emergency fund.  This will give them a total of $56,000.06 in savings,<n>Bob and Helen will need $22,000.06 to pay off their mortgage, pay cash for a down payment on another property, pay off the mortgage from their retirement savings and put money into a new emergency fund<n>On top of all that, Bob and Helen

The only question was whether you could find deodorant in your home or outside.<n>Output = 3*3/4={{3/4}}, {{1/4}} = 1.00<n>Input: Let's assume that 1/2 the number of cars are on the road at any given time during the winter months. The best time to park is in the off-duty hours when traffic is least congested.  So the best time to park is 1 hour before all the cars are expected to be on the road.  Let's say you are arriving at a hotel at midnight and you're the only person staying overnight.  How long will it take to get to the reception desk?  What about if you're parking in a driveway or garage?<n>Output: Depends on how long it takes you to walk from the car to the desk.  If you are arriving at midnight it will take you 12 minutes to walk all the way from the car to the reception desk and 20 minutes walking from the desk to the stairs to the lobby. if you pull in just before closing time when it is crowded, it will take you 3 minutes to walk all the walk to the reception desk and 10 minutes walk to the lobby.<n>Output = 3/2-10 = 2.00<n><n>Input: Suppose I want to pay someone else's cellphone bill.  I don't know if it is $1 or $2 or $4 or $5 or whatever.... and the guy lives in Washington State on the east coast and I live in New York State on the west coast. I don't realize that his family might also use the cellphone.  How would I know that?  How would I know how to determine if his family will or won't use the cellphone?  Where do I check to see if the family members of the other person who I'm paying might use the cellphone?  Can I just assume that their family will?<n>Output: The first step is to determine whether there is a charge on the account.  For bills under $1 you will simply have a receipt for a credit on your cell phone bill.  For bills over $1 the company will have a separate charge on the account that will be recorded.  If there is no charge, there likely is a balance that has been put on the account that you can pay online and on your cell phone.

How did he know how many pieces were in there?<n>Output: A: 34 A: 23 C: 6 D: 7 E: 6<n>He got 17 if he counted every piece including the pencil.  If he counted the pencil, he got 10.<n>This gave him a total of 34 + 8 + 7 = >34.<n>This is because 34 is 1/4 and that is the smallest number bigger than 4.  When he counted 34 pieces he started with a total of 34/1 = 1, and he rounded up to 34 so that the total after the 2 + 8 = 8 was the rounded number.<n>When Bob wrote "I took 7 to write the letter", it gave Bob the largest total.  This is because 7 was the largest number bigger than 5.<n>If Bob wanted to have an even larger total then he could count up by 1 first, then 2 then 3 then 4, then 5, then 6, then 7 and then 8.  Then he would write 2 lines.  When he made 2 lines it would then be 2.33.  So he would have made 34 * 2.33 = 34.  When Bob wrote 7 lines, it would give him 14.<n>When Bob wrote B he began with 7 and then went down to 7/1 = 12.  It gave him 10.<n>When Bob wrote D he began with 7, went down to 7/12 = 10, then up to 7/4 = 16.  It gave him 14.<n>When he wrote lead, he began by writing "lead pencil".  It gave him a total of 14 + 32 + 28 = 64.<n>Now all the way down he wrote 6.  That gave him 12, when he finally reached 32 he wrote 6.<n>Output:<n>A: 1 B: 8 E: 7 F: 10 G: B N: 6 O: 6 P: 12 D: 6 R: 6 S: 6 T: 6 U: 6 W: 6<n>Bob earned 30*8 + 10*24 + 24 = 48.  Now 8 was twice as many as 9, so he got 6.<n>Output: 6*5 + 8 = 12 * 8 = 16<n>Bob earned 3*8 * 8 = 12 * 8.  When he got 8 first, it gave him 8 plus

Which is the most reasonable answer: C: expensive, generous, D: gift buyer<n>Output, answer is D<n><n>Input:Give someone you are known to buy presents for a gift or money.  What will appear in their inventory?  How many presents will they have available?  Assume a gift for 50 people.  If you buy a gift, they will have 75 gifts (50+75=50=75).  If you pay for their gifts with money (but don't ask for money back) you will have spent $75 on people's gifts.  If you gave $1000 to the person who gifted you, you will have spent $1200 of gift money.  If you gave them $3000 of your own money, you will have spent almost $500.  Suppose your gift did not cover all of their expenses and you also gave them half of what you would have paid them anyway.  How would that increase the number of presents available for them?<n>Output:75+50+75 = 75+50*50 = 75+50*150 = 75+75=150 gifts<n>The total number of gifts will be 15.<n>The total number of presents available for the person who gifted you is 75*150/(75+50)=<n>The number of presents the person gives you will be 15*150/(75+75)=10<n>Therefore if your gift was a $75 gift, you still have $75 left over but you will spend $250 on presents because of the gifts you gave them for free.<n>Thus your gift to the person who gifted to you was $150*75=450, meaning your gift was $450 (75+50)=$900 in total<n>You spent $1000 on people's gifts.<n><n>Input:What is the name of a fruit that is poisonous if you eat an entire grape?<n>Output: grapefruit<n><n>Input:What animal has been in the news lately and has its food source threatened by a new government law?<n>Output: a tiger<n><n>Input:What's a good trick to play on those who are very smart, but forget things and forget where things are?<n>Output: A cat can never forget where he is.<n><n>Input:You can find a person with a reputation for stealing from others with the help of the following:<n>- The person can only be

Their first house together cost $65,000 and they've done a lot of things together in that time.  Her husband is in his 30s.  Every morning for a year they have to drive to a mall that's less than 30 minutes away to go shopping.  In December Diana wanted $40 off her gas for her car, so she went into Walmart, got her discount and she started filling up her car.  She had $100 worth of groceries left and she was going to buy a new pair of sneakers.  She went back to the car and bought another pair.  The last time she bought sneakers was four years before.  She didn't think that the purchase would be that big, but she had one item needed with the first pair and now she went with another pair.  In total after she went to the store she had $175 worth of groceries that she would have to spend $55 to buy again.  So Diana paid $50 more than usual for two weeks and spent $55 of her own money.  The next week her husband paid for the gas, but she didn't spend the $55.  His dad gave her the money she needed since his father was out of town.  Diana spent $20 of her own money and saved $20 for her dad to make it up to her.  Diana still didn't know why she went to the store, but she knew she had left something for her father that he had said was needed.  Diana said she felt upset after the incident because she knew about the money and she didn't use it, but she had promised him she would.  In total her husband had the chance to spend 35% less than usual on groceries before going shopping.  In total her car cost 35% less than normal by using her discount and she saved 35% money by using gas instead of going to the mall.

Choices:  A: michigan B: stable C: race track D: farm yard E: arizona<n>Output:		 a horse is likely to live in a stable.  We need a horse to be at least 1.5x the size of the others, so in reality, we need at least 2 horses.  We need a stable if there are more than 2 horses in the party.  To determine whether or not there are more then 2 horses, we need to know whether or not they are in stalls.  We should know where the stable is.  A race track is what you would do if you wanted to move the horses after the party.  A horse is not likely to live in a stall so the only option is a stable since the animals are separated.  If there are no horses in a stable, there should not be a barn unless it is specifically stated that some animals are housed in a barn while others live in the outdoors.  We need to know what animals are housed in which locations.  So, we need to look up a local horse racing organization that will give us a complete list of the horses housed in a given location.  Each horse gets a name, a nickname, a horse code name, and a breed.  We should add this information to each animal and divide by 3 to determine whether a horse has more than 3 legs.  We should also know the approximate size of the animals in each area.  We should also look up the population size of each area.  We can do this and make some educated guesses as to the likelihood of each location.  The more accurate the guesses, the more likely the selection will be.  We should have 3 horses with similar characteristics in these 3 areas.  We can then narrow our choices by removing animals that are in a location other than these 3 areas or horses that are more than 1/3 the size of any other horse in the area.  This way, we will know what we are looking for and hopefully have 3 to 4 horse choices.  We can then try our luck and see what we get.  The number of animals determines how many choices we get, we know that.  You can then run down the first horse you get.  Use that first horse to make more choices to determine which horses have the most likeliness of being in each location.

Choices:  A: eat grass B: play C: kept in stables D: dominated E: drink coffee<n>Output:		 They can gather food in small amount and they are able to move to new places quickly so they cannot get much energy without their needs to be covered.  They need to stay in one place at all times.<n><n>To use a real life example. Take a horse and feed him and then let him go outside and leave him out there until he decides to eat again. Then feed him again. When he eats for the third time you give him the same treats. He only wants to eat more and more every day if he is out of food, not every other day. This is called a high gainer diet. He requires constant attention and his needs are met.<n>For our example however, we can think our way around this.<n>Suppose we have a horse named Marnie. She is a medium sized horse about 65-75 lbs. She eats just as much grass as the other horses. She loves being outside and playing. She is very good at riding, she has been ridden by professional riders. Marnie would eat more than just grass if we let her. She is a social horse so she needs to be around other horses. We will not only feed her some grass and other treats when we want her to eat some grass, we will also feed her a lot of water. She drinks it up. Water needs to be something the horse drinks so that it doesn't need to eat grass it doesn't want to eat. After a while she becomes lazy and will just stand there at the water trough without eating. When we try to give her more food she gets anxious and just doesn't want to eat any more. Over time she becomes too fat and cannot move when she is not being walked. She tires out and can't run as well. When this happens we are often forced to put her on a diet. On a diet she is still allowed to eat grass because the food helps her stay fit but her energy will always be limited. After she has eaten grass she can't go outside at the same times the other horses are outside anymore. We must put her in a stall so that she has no access to the grass.<n>We can come up with an example for many other animal types. Imagine a horse that is just too lazy, a horse that is too aggressive, or a horse that is just not able to handle his environment because of a disability. We would then need to feed the horse a high gain diet and keep him on a diet for his whole life. This is probably not as helpful as

She yelled at him not to leave his things where? Choices:  A: toy store B: hall C: bathroom D: amusement park E: fairgrounds<n>Output:		 If we had an amusement park here, his mom would probably be more upset about her toy being broken than about a piece of fabric getting lost.  I think his mom would be annoyed when mom asked him not to play with his toys, but I think the fun he has having a giant animal and a little girl with a stuffed animal would outweigh the annoyance. I also think this is a much more likely situation than him leaving his stuff in the hall.  Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: The mom would be annoyed if he left his stuff anywhere in front of the couch she was sitting on, but he would be even more upset if he left his stuffed animal on the carpet in front of the couch.  I think he should put his stuffed animals on a high shelf so he can still have fun while mom is out of the room. Choices:  A D C<n>Output: This is the same thing as her being upset with him if he left his stuffed animals in the hall.  This would be a really easy choice for me, so I don't think there is any risk in having an animal on the couch.  Choices: E<n><n>Input:Mary is pregnant.

Mark owns 40 cows.  His mother will provide all of the milk. Her parents will pay him a check for 40% of his milk yield.  Mark owns 30 cows.  He will receive a cheque for 90% of his cow's milk yield.  Mark now owns 80 cows from his previous cow herd.  He will receive the cheque for $350 per cow.  Mark and Mary have 10 cows.  Mark will receive $35 per cow.  Mark paid Mary $250 per cow.  He received an extra $50 in his cheque because she took care of the calves.  So now he has a total of $375 per cow.  Mark owns 1 cow and his parents will pay him $500 per cow.  If each cow in Mark's new cow herd produces $200, he will have 150% of his total yield.  If each cow produces $200, he'll only get $75.  So the total on his farm is $250.  Mark is looking at his cow inventory and he thinks he would like some calves. Mark wants to get 100 calves. So he takes care of their needs and he takes them on rides. This will increase their herd to 130 cows.  So Mark has 130 cows.  Mark's parents will pay him $350.  They will provide two cows for every calf.  The remaining cost of the calves will be paid for by their parents.  They will also provide the cows with hay.  Mark must buy 100 millet for each calf.  He will purchase the millet and feed them millet and hay. Mark also needs some feed for every calf. Mark will buy feed for 100 calves. In total his farm is $700. If he has 110 cows and 100 calves which means the total milk and feed should be $300 but $175 is what he spent in total his cow herd is 150.  So the total cost of a single calf is $100.  Mark has a total income of $200.  So Mark makes a profit of $100.<n><n>Input:Mark's mother needs to make $150 this week to pay off her student loans.

So the harder part was dropping the object when you had only one arm.  So the final answer is dropping the object.<n>If you only had two arms it was harder to stand tall and straight while holding onto the object<n>Since you only had two arms, you couldn't lift up the object when your arm was extended to your side<n>So the final answer was dropping the object.<n>Input: What is the biggest difference between a man-made object and an object in the real world?<n>Output: In the real world, you have to have all your legs together or you can't take steps.<n>Note * this is not the real world<n>Output: You have to be bent at the waist when you take a step.

However, since moving an object takes less energy than moving a man, it takes longer for an object with one arm to move than an object with two arms.<n>Since moving through the room takes energy, it would take a longer time for an object with one leg to move than an object that was moving with two legs.  Therefore, the final answer is moving objects.<n>If you only have one hand, it's harder to take a step.

Choose any one of the following options and provide your proof. Output: A: individuals B: corporations C: the country D: the people<n>Output: A is correct.  The government takes in about $400 million from individuals and another $1200 million from corporations each year.  The two groups come out even.  The country takes in $1200 million from individuals and about $400 million from corporations.<n>The overall amount of income taxes paid annually by individuals is about $300 million, while the amount paid by corporations is almost as much, but about 70% of all the corporate taxes paid annually go into military budgets, and about 30% of military budget goes into other government activities such as law enforcement.  In total individual income taxes pay out $100 million to each person, while corporations pay in $250 million, or only about 20 cents on each dollar.<n>If the military budget is cut, less military personnel will be needed and because those armed militaries do not need millions of dollars per year salaries and benefits, they are going down in number which would cut income taxes paid to government.<n>Since there is more income in military than people, the only other source of tax money would be to tax people, but if income taxes are going down then taxes on corporations would also

So she now has 89*1 = 89*1 = 89 stickers on her journal.<n>She put the stickers that were on her cover page and made a stack of those on page 2 that would have increased sticker counts over previous periods. So she has 89*2 = 89* 2 = 89 stickers on her covered journal.<n>She put each sticker on a different page and made a stack on each page that showed the correct amount of stickers to the left of the sticker. So she now has 87*1 = 87*1 = 87 stickers<n>The total count of stickers she put in her bound journal is 87<n>So the final answer in this multiple choice question is 87

When he asked the children what was the most disgusting thing about them he got many, "the way they walk around chewing on their legs like they are candy."  The kangaroos and the goats are very different animals with different behaviors.  When Mark was asked if people wash their hands when they go shopping he said, "of course.  Do you think I'm going to buy things all over the ground or in the grass?"<n>So last week, on Tuesday Mark had 19 goats and 3 kangaroos.<n>On Wednesday, he had 23 goats and 2 kangaroos.  He then went into the kitchen and washed his hands with soap and water.  The kangaroo had some dirt on it and he just brushed it off with his hands.  He also put some water in a clean dishpan so that he could wash his hands after putting the kangaroos in the dishpan.  It took a few minutes but he eventually got all his dirt off of them.  He also made sure to place the bucket of water in the dishpan so that he would always be able to wash his hands after washing his hands.<n>So in total he washed his hands with his hands, not dirty dirty hands with the kangaroos, but clean Hands with soap and water.<n>So what we are seeing this week is that he has an animal habit, he just cleans himself up with a wash cloth now instead of with dirt and with the goats he washes them as soon as they stand up while they are being taken out of the house.<n>So for this question we need to use Mark's behavior and his hand hygiene habits.  We can then write the values of the hands and the hands.<n><n>Input: You are working with 100 pairs of glasses. Each pair has a different price.

The cost of legal fees in his area are $400 an hour.  He saves $250 of his paycheck each month.  For every ten hours of work he completes he saves $50.  Since he works 30 + 30 + 10 means that he has a total of 66 hours of work each month.  He can earn up to $800 per month.  He has $1500 in savings.  He wants to buy his first house.  How much does he need to earn before he sells his current home and buys a house?<n>Output: For every 30 hours of work he completes, he saves $50 per month and $800 per month.<n>So for this week he will earn $200*30+66=$200<n>For every 50 hours he completes, he saves 50 per month and $800<n>So he will have $500 after he saves $200.<n>So he needs to earn $1000 before he can buy his first house<n>So to pay for the house the final answer is $1000-$1200 = $<<1000-$1200=42>>42<n>Since the house he will buy will cost $1200 per month, his monthly budget will cover his legal fees after taxes for two years.<n>So the final number is 42+1200 = $<<42+1200=75>>75 houseshare<n>So it makes sense to spend your extra $10-$12 on food and other supplies now since he will not be able to save as much in the near future.  He should wait until the spring to buy a house<n>So the final number for the total house cost is $1200-$1500 = $<<1200-$1500=72>>72<n><n>Input: Mark is at a large job fair.

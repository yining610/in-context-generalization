What steps does your school take to help them?\nOutput: The school tries to be as accommodating to everyone as possible. The students who have the hardest time adjusting to school are special education students because their teachers are not as familiar with the differences students are facing. Also, there is a lot of pressure to do well when the students are taking tests, and because of that, often the test is not the only factor of students\u2019 success.

By counting the number of people who have taken the other apples, we can calculate the chance of getting at least one apple left out of ten (30%) and that there must be at least four out of ten left out (70%).

The price he has decided on is $150. He decides to go to the dollar store and get 4 bicycles for $40. George sells 2 bikes online and buys 2 second hand bikes. Which do you think is the better deal for George?\nOutput: Since George decided to sell 2 bikes online, he makes a total of 10 trips in the store. If George has a total of 10 trips, he would be responsible for spending $25.\nSo the total amount George would need to earn per store visit is $45 - $35 = $40\nSo the final answer for George is $40\n\nInput: George\u2019s dad likes to shop at the dollar store. The average cost of a bicycle at a dollar store is $16. To George's Dad, the cheapest bicycle is worth $16 so he bought four bicycles at a dollar store and gave one to his friend. What is the total cost that George has to earn at a store for his dad to purchase it at a better price?\nOutput: George needs to earn $32 if George's dad needs $160\nUsing George\u2019s total budget of $110 + $32 = $160, his dad\u2019s total budget is $170.\nThis comes out to $30 divided by 10 + $32 = $40, which is the same as it would be if George had spent $40 for the bicycles to begin with.\nSo the final amount that George has to earn if his dad has a budget of $170, is the same as if George purchased the bicycles with $40.\nSo the final $40 he would earn if his dad bought the bicycles for $170 is $30 divided by $80 = $80\nSo the total amount he earns would be $40.\nSo $40 divided by $80 = 2.5$\nSo $80 divided by $200 = 7.75$\nSo in addition to the $80 George has made from his dad, he also earns $7 from his friend\nSo the final answer has to be $7\n\nInput: Josh was sitting in the dentist's office on Monday when his dentist put his crown (a piece of gold) in.

{"text": "A\nWhen light strikes a paper, a small amount of oxygen is absorbed (O2), and the paper will begin to change shape (E), then to dry (D) and finally to absorb water (O). O2 is not very reactive, so it will probably be quickly absorbed. The paper will eventually turn to dry tissue paper when it absorbs enough O2.\nA paper that has been left outside in the sun will be moist and will take time to dry with no changes in its physical appearance. However, if it is moved indoors or outside the sun, it will dry rather fast and become rigid and crumpled. The paper is not very reactive, but because it is absorbing oxygen quickly and because it is moist, it would be very reactive to direct sunlight.\nIn general, all materials can be recycled when placed outside even if their shape changes, such as plastic.\nMaterial A, that has been outside the sun, probably did not have to be recycled, but since the paper was moist, it is different.\nMaterial A that has been outside the air conditioning, is probably quite good and is easy to recycle.\nMaterial B, that has been placed inside the sun would probably just be put on display and put away rather quickly.\nMaterial C, that has been put outside should be recycled and should be put on display and eventually put away.\nMaterial D, that has been put inside the sun has not been as good as another material, so you would probably prefer not to dispose of it with all the others.\nMaterial D that has been given some water would probably be better than all the others, but I would probably recycle it first (probably not put it inside the sun).\nMaterial E, that has been placed in the sun would not be considered very good.\n\nOutput: A paper can be recycled even if it has been placed outside the sun without changing its shape. A sheet of paper, especially a folded one, can be recycled even if its shape changes because the material it is made of does not change when the paper is in the sun. Paper that is too wet to be folded (especially papers folded with tape) cannot be recycled. A folded piece of paper that is wet can be recycled in a cardboard box with a fan and paper towels on the outside (see my previous post)\nThe paper must be placed outside the sun to be truly recycled, or not really recycled...\n\nInput: What does it mean to make a pencil last a long time?\nOutput: A", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

You will have opportunities to get the work you like by helping other applicants with their proposal.\n4) Pass course: Passing a course is one of the best ways to get on with life. You will probably get a job as an intern for at least a year because of the learning experience. Even if you don't work and get a salary, getting experience will give you a great skill set to benefit you in later job searches.\n5) Play lottery: Play the lottery on your very first payment as a job seeker. With your first payment, you can buy one ticket per category. Take a careful look at the numbers in each category in terms of profit potential and decide if you think they are worth your time to buy. When you spend less than 20% of the ticket value in any category, you will be a winner! If you win you get to keep the rest. The lottery is definitely a fun and interesting way to go. As you get more used to play, you realize that it takes a lot of money to make a good profit in one trip!\n\nInput: What amount of money might you earn as a part time cashier?

He kept counting backwards until he got to 5.  Then he was back in dreamland.\nSo James started counting backwards. He stopped every 4 seconds on his way to 5 and every 5 seconds on his way back to 10.  He finally got back to 5 and stopped counting.\nSo he started counting backwards one minute at a time.  He counted back 5 at a time and stopped counting every second after that.  There were only 15 seconds at a time.\nSo there were 5 x 5 = 12 minutes.  Since the minutes were increasing, then we can divide every second into 5 chunks.  To achieve his goal in less than 15 seconds we needed exactly 120 seconds = 5 x (15 - 15)*12 = 1200 seconds = 1330 seconds = 3975 seconds of counting.\nAfter doing this many times per minute, James reached 10 and stopped.

So James was counting backwards 4 times at a time (120 seconds) plus each time he got to 4 he would think, \"The longer I keep counting, I am losing my ability to count.  I am losing my ability.\"  This is why James decided to stop after 4 minutes (120 seconds).  At first he wasn't sure he would wake up.  There was nothing that could stop him from counting.

{"text": "A: kitchen cupboard B; Pantry; Refrigerator\nIf the jar is left on the kitchen cupboard and is left for two hours, it'll fall and spill and it is very likely to spoil. Therefore, putting it in the pantry is safest and would be the best to use. But if it's put in the refrigerator, it will stay safe. The same principle is true when I have a bottle of medicine. I put it in the refrigerator, since it's safe in the refrigeration unit, but if it's put in a cupboard for the day and I forget to take it out again, it'll spoil. Therefore, in a jar there are two places more likely to put it. However, I'm not putting it in the refrigerator because my refrigerator is much colder since I have to store my medicine in the refrigerator. Therefore, I put it in the pantry.

What is the minimum number of tablespoonsful of flour needed for her ball to be covered?\nOutput:The number of tablespoonsful of dough needed to fill Sophia\u2019s ball is 1/(4^0)^3 = 0.1 tablespoonsful.\nThe minimum amount of flour needed to fill the whole ball is 0.5 tablespoonsful.\nSo the final total is 0.1 tablespoonsful of flour + 0.5 tablespoonsful of dough = 0.1^0.5 + 0.5^0.5 = 0.01 tablespoonsful of flour. So her ball was 0.01 tablespoonful of dough.\nSo the total answer is 0\n\nInput:The two sides of a square are 3 sides and they are connected. They are 4 sides and the other side is 2 sides.

For example, the owner pays the father $40 per month to do household cleaning. If that money is added to Adam's paycheque, how much extra money does he get? Would adding it to his allowance count?\nInput: A family friend owns a business. He sells some of his paintings to fund the business. He also sells some of his artwork. He has an average income of $200 per week. He has $100 in his bank account, which leaves $100 + $40 in his check book to buy the paintings. This leaves him $40 - $100 = $<<100-40=50>>50 on his checkbook. So, in total $50 = <<$50 - $40 = 30>>30 less than his paycheque. But what would be the difference in the amount Adam's paycheque has without the $40 in his checkbook to keep it from being less than expected?\nOutput:\nAssuming his paycheque is $80 per week then Adam's payment will be $160/week - $40 - $60 = <<$160-60=80>>80\nSo Adam's payment would be lower by $80/week - $40 + $60 = $<<<$80-40=60>>60\nSince Adam's paycheque is $160/week - |<<40-60>>60 - <<$80-40=0>>0\n, he has more money than expected\nSo the final answer will be $40\n\nInput: A family has 2 children.

{"text": "the more food you share the more likely you are to have a sister. But the more family members a sister shares with, the less likely she is to share a brother.\nOutput/Explanation: The more food you share the likelier you are to have a brother.\nOutput: The more food you get, the more likelier you are to be a child with a sister.\nSo the only logical conclusion to make is that sisters have the higher probability of sharing siblings with brothers. And, if you share food, the more likely it is that you will share a sister.\nSo, if your brother is on the bottom left side of your family, you have the highest chance of sharing a sister.\nBut, if your brother is a part of your left hand side of the family then you have the lowest chance of sharing a brother.\nSo, as sisters share foods, there is usually a sibling sharing food with them.\nSo, if you want to know the most common family members, first of all, share foods. Then, share some food with these foods. Then, look for siblings and see if you share brothers with them. And then, look for sisters and see if they share sisters with their brothers. The more people a sistress shares a brother with, the more likely she is to share sisters with her brothers. And, the more likely she will share brothers with other people as well.\nOutput: If you share foods, sistresses have the higher chance of sharing siblings with brothers\nIf you share siblings with people, and they share some food with you, the more likely you are that they will share some foods with eachother as well.\nOutput/Explaination: If you share foods or siblings with people, they will share with eachothers food and siblings as well.\nOutput = So, it is very likely that sisters share foods or siblings with brothers\nOutput = Sisters share foods or siblings with both their brothers and sisters\nOutput = Sibling-brother sharing is a family\nOutput = That's right!

{"text": "Tomato plant grown in the garden must get 1 harvest when 5 plants are planted.\nThe weight of a flower petal can be stated as W*P*Y. For W you can use the number of times a flower is picked. So for flower A you might use W*50*10=20\nTo get the weight of the flower, you can multiply by 10. So 20/50=120 or 80.\nThe weight of an animal can also be stated as:\nW.Y=P*A\nW=1 times W is 1 unit\nX=5 times W is 5 units + W\nAnd, X=x is 5 1/2 units\nThe weight of a vegetable is:\nW=P*A\nTo get W, subtract W*2. So W=2.X\nTherefore:\n1.0/5 = 30 = W\n0.9/5 = 9 = W * 1\nX=2 = X * 1\nTherefore:\n1 units of X = 2/5 = 2/5 * - 1 = 6/5 = 1/6 = 1/6 = 2/6\nBut you still haven\u2019t solved for 2x.

The sign is 12 feet by 2 feet. The paint color that you choose has 10 different colors. You have to paint only one color for each color. What color should you choose?\nOutput: You will want to limit paint to 10 different colors, because painting in 10 different colors would make it easy to use more than one color in a single sign. So you will only paint the 10 different colors of paint.\nOutput: You will choose paint number 1 because the price for paint number 1 is $20.\nOutput: Since, it would be easy to use more than 1 color, paint number 5 will be the color you will use.\nOutput: As many different colors as you want.\nSo the final painting will be the paint number 1 paint color.\nOutput: This will look good.\n\nWhat if the price is $200?

{"text": "Go for a bike ride with a friend.\nWhat is 2 grams of water and 1000 calories? 1000 = <200x/2000>200\nSo, get 2 grams of water and 2000 calories = 2400 - 200 = 2400 = 1200 grams of food. So, you need 1800 grams of food. The above exercise needs 1400 calories and a daily weight is 2000 kilocalories. So, 1400 kilocalories x 2000 grams of food per day = 2400 Calories. So you need 2100 calories per day = 2400 x 2100 = 3600 calories per day.

So, for example, if you want to attach a chainring to the wall outlet fixture, the chainring must be fixed onto 1 kg.  If 2 kg is already attached to the fixture, there is no difference between attaching the fixture + chainring to 2 kg, then attaching the fixture + chain ring to 2 kg + 1 kg.\nSo, if I screw in chainring onto wall outlet fixture, if I attach my fixture + chainring to a weight that weighs 2 kg and I also attach my fixture + chain ring to the weight that weighs 2 kg + 3 kg, then the total weight is 3 kg.  Just 2 kg is attached to the fixture + chainring.  I can then attach a weight of 1 kg and a weight of 1 kg is already attached to my fixture + chainring.\nSo, if you are trying to attach a chainring on a weight that has already been attached by another chainring, then the chainring is fixed upon attachment.\nSo, if 2 kg is stuck on the outlet fixture and the outlet gets hot, then that 2 kg will heat and the chainring will melt and you will lose what was attached to the outlet fixture.", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

So what is the most important thing which you need to realize first time? 3) You need to find someone who can inspire you. But do not forget about your friends and your self-respect. In case someone likes you, you will forget about your self-respect and all the good things that you do for yourself. You need to remember that life is not just a matter about success. You need to remember it as a journey.\n4) No matter how hard, it is not impossible, even successful people do make mistakes. You should never forget that. In any case, learn from it and never let it become a bad habit. Learn from your mistakes and get it done better next time. 5) It is not necessary that you always do your homework even for the exams. Study only if you need to. You may still improve some things on your own. 6) To change a bad thing in your life, you must stop it. Remember, \"never do that thing again\". 7) When you fail, make sure you will never give in and give up. You will always learn something from it: if you fail at something, keep it in mind and you will not fail at anything else. 8) In every job, there is one chance which someone does not think is important. If you will work on those chances, it can turn your life around in a very short period of time. If you will not take chances in your life, it will never work and you will end up just complaining to others about your life and your failures. 9) Failure can be a blessing in disguise. You can learn a lot about yourself if you are not successful. 10) There is a limit to how much you can earn by doing very little.

The boat can carry 60 people in its cabin. The boat can carry 50 people in it's passenger seat. The boat can carry 30 people on board the bow and a cargo hold. What is the optimal position where the most people can be carried?\nOutput: The optimum position based on map and information is to carry each house 50 people inside the cabin, the rest on boat.\nThe boat must hold 30 people per cabin.\nSo, for each house 50 people can be carried inside 50 + 30 = 200 people inside the house, but only 20 + 30 = 160 people on boat.\nSo, the boat must hold 160 + 20 = 240 people inside the house, and 160 + 30 = 320 people on boat.\nIn total, 240 people are able to be carried inside 120 + 60 = 240 people on boat, and 160 people can be carried inside 60 + 120 = 240 people inside the cabin.\nSo, if you were the captain, how many people would you set as passengers inside boat?\nOutput: There are 5 people on a small boat. The maximum passenger it can carry on the boat is 60. The maximum passenger it is allowed to carry is 30 inside cabin. So, the boat has 60 passenger capacity and 40 passenger capacity, so it can carry 120 passengers inside cabin.\nInput: There are 20 people on the ship. The ship can carry 240 people.

Thus the ship's number of passengers cannot exceed 240.\nThe ship's smallest cabins can only carry 40 passengers. So, it must have 120 + 120 = 160 passengers inside.\n\nInput: There is a bridge over a river. The length of the river is 4 km. Only two boats can pass each day, or 6 persons each.

So, the first thing you need to do is add 60 grams of food to the bus.\nThis will make you weight 6200 grams.\nThe total amount of food the bus contains is 1200 grams.

The first part of the course is drawing, which is easy for most students. The second part of the course is painting, which Sarah is more capable at. How much time would Sarah need to devote to the art part of the course?\nInput: Sarah started the class with a drawing of a flower. She then made three drawings of flowers. There are 18 drawings total and they can be grouped together as three parts. If Sarah can count three flowers every 30 seconds for 30 minutes her time should be divided into 18 parts and her total time for the art course will be 30 minutes.\nOutput: Because she got 3/5 stars, she also got 3/5 stars on each part of her art project. So at the end of the 30 minutes, Sarah has 2.83 times the total time that she should have spent on the class.\nSo the total time she would have spent on the course is 18 x 3.83 = 4800 minutes = 4800 hours\nOn average Sarah should have spent 48 hours per week on this course. But instead she only spent 3 hours per week which breaks the class rule in that she is expected to spend at least 3 hours on 2 subjects.\nTherefore her total time is 3 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours which is more than 3 hours and a half per week\nSo her 24 hour week is 3 hours and 16 minutes less than she should have been spending.\nSo the total hours she could have been spending on this part of the course is 4 hours and 16 minutes. This would have been better than her 24 hours week.\nSo the total number of minutes she could have been spending at the end of her 24 hour week would have been 3/4 of the time she spent at the beginning of her 24 hour week\nSo the total minutes she could have spent at the end of her 48 hour week\nIf she had spent only 2 or 3 more hours per week on the course, she might have had 24 hours, not 48 hours. So that would have been better than a 48 hour week.\nSo her 24 hour Week was 3 hours and 16 minutes.

So, 150 * 0.0475 = 300 square feet. So, it would take 300 * 0.0475 * 0.0250 = 2000 square feet\nSo, to get an estimate of the amount of people who show up for the Derby, I would have to calculate the square footage of the grandstand area, the number of horses they bring with them, and the total weight of the horses in the grandstand plus their food.\nWith a rough estimate that 1000 people will show up, the total square footage and the total weight of each horse would be 1000*2.5/2.5 + 2000*5x/2.5 - 2000*y - 2000*350/2.5 = 1900.\nThis is 1900 + 1000 - 200 = 1700\nSo it would be 1700 * 1700 + 2000 * 0.1750 = 1950\nSo, this brings the total square footage to 1900 * 30 = 9,700 square feet\nSo, people actually show up, rather then just betting on it.\nSo the Derby's main event will have about 9,7000 people in it.

A winemaker selects a grape and then packages it in a bottle.  Finally the box containing the bottle of wine is sealed and a label is affixed. The wine is delivered to the end consumer.\n\nInput:In order to make an applesauce pie on a daily basis, a pie shop must buy 2 apple crates, put in 8 pounds of apples each, and stack 2 barrels on top of them. What is the total weight of the apples that you need to buy for this process to be effective?\nOutput: Apples are put into each crate and put into crates by hand.  The crates stack up on top of each other and are covered by a curtain.  Then the barrels are covered by a curtain with a hose going into them.\nAn apple crate is a 40-ton container.  An apple barrel is a 3-ton container.\nAn apple barrel has 80 apples in it.\nAn apple crate has a capacity of 20 tons.\nSo the total weight of apple crates and apple barrels is 480 pounds.\nSuppose that the final weight of the apples in each crate is 480 pounds.\nSo the total amount of apples purchased to make a single pie is 480*20*80 = 960 pounds.\nThis is only 360 pounds less than the total amount of apples needed for the applesauce type of pie making.\nSo, the final output is 480 = 960 + 20 = 960 * (60 - 60 =) 10\nThe applesauce type of pies is made with apples that are pre-picked by a local farmer.\nIn general, apples weigh less than 1 pound.\nSo, the weight of the apples used by a person to make applesauce is about 900 pounds.\n\nInput:  Alice and Mary need to write a poem.

{"text": "A: basketball game, an outdoor movie at the fairgrounds B: movie theatre C: state park D: playground\nIf a person uses all three choices, what is the probability that he's in one of these locations?\nOutput:If a person uses only basketball and movie and gets to choice A, then it is 60%. If he only uses basketball and movie and gets choice B and choice E, let x = 5 x 4 x 2 x 4 x 2 = 25 = 56%. If he only uses movie, let x = 8 x 8 x 8 x 8. So, it is more likely that he will get basketball and movie than choose any other choice, he just has to have a few options. Let x = 5 x 4 = 15. Let x be 7 x 8 = 20. Let n be the total amount of time this person must play basketball. So, if he plays three games, that's 5 minutes, 15 seconds per game and 60 seconds for all three games if he only uses movie. So, it's very likely that he will choose basketball and movie.\nInput:A person is looking to buy a piece of jewelry from a jewelry store.

{"text": "C: a concert: an airport: a university - a concert is a private event at an approved establishment. So the term \"highly criticized security\" would not apply here.  It is simply not available.  D:  a university: a concert is a public event involving the security of the performers.  It might be that \"highly criticized security\" could be used when describing an event that does not involve the security of the performers but is nevertheless highly criticized.  E:  Terminal security for a flight makes use of some very powerful people.\nA: university: a concert: a concert is a private, invitation-only event involving the security of performers only.  This is not true for a university because you can get access to the interior of a concert hall by being one of the concert's sponsors.  Therefore, the security provided by the concert's sponsors, and the security obtained at the University of Alabama, Alabama A&M University, University of Texas, and many other universities, differs from a university's overall security.  And this is precisely what I was saying about highly criticized security.  F:  a terminal: it takes the shape of a terminal.  For example, Bournemouth Airport has a major terminal but it is also known as Bournemouth Airport because it is located in England.  Therefore, airport security would not include airport security but would instead refer to terminal security.  G:  a terminal on the ground: the terminal on the ground is similar in form to an aircraft hangar.  While an aircraft hangar is usually made up of many floors, a terminal can only house one floor at a time.  It is therefore like an aircraft hangar in that it contains an area where pilots land their aircraft.  Therefore, airport terminal security does not include airport security since a terminal on the ground is a separate entity than a terminal on the ground.  That definition of airport security does not apply to a terminal on the ground because the airport terminal is only a temporary fixture used to make the necessary preparations for an aircraft on the way.  Therefore, airport airport security does not include terminal airport security.\nH:  a concert: a concert has security guards, but at a concert it's a private event.  It is therefore unlikely that security guards will be used.  A concert requires people coming to attend to be escorted by security guards - at least for the opening hour or two.

{"text": "Choices:\nA: Crash\nB: Living\nC: Slow down\nD: Carry people\nE: Speed up\nNow calculate each one of those things individually.\nEach one of those things costs something else. What is the cost of carrying people?\nOutput: A cabin costs something to build. Cost is the cost in dollars of the materials necessary to build the cabin.   The number of people costs something because the number of people is inversely proportional to the square of the number of people.  If we reduce the square of the number 2 by 1, then the number of people costs $0.  So, it costs $0 to carry 2 people, $100 for carrying three people, $500 for carrying four people, and $1,000 for carrying five people.  That makes a cost of $1000 when using $1,000 as the base.\nIn addition to the material cost of the cabin, there is also the cost per person to carry.\nIn effect, the cost of carrying people comes out to be about the value of the cabin since $1 = 1450 dollars and $1000 = 4500 dollars.  So, we subtract the cost of carrying people from $1000 and it is only a cost of $250.\nIn addition to carrying, the plane is also going to pay for fuel (gasoline) to run the plane and to bring the people to its destination.\nThe total cost of the airplane:\n1,000$ $100$100 $500 $1000$1000$1000$1,000$10,000$10,0001$10,0002$10,000$7000$7000$10000$10000$20000$20000$200", "answer": "D: carry people"}

If John\u2019s team scores a total of 3,000 points over the entire 4 seasons, John needs to average 40 (not counting the ones he has already earned) points every season for the team to have an overall average of 1,000 points per season. If only John scores 1000 points, how many points is John missing from that total?\nOutput: Let x be the total score of the football team over the 4 seasons.\nThe score for the past four seasons is 49 * 4 = <<49x4=63>>63 points\nThe total number of points will be 63 x 4 = <<63 x 4=99>>100 points\nOver its whole 4-season career, the team scored 49 * 4 =<<49x4=63|49|49|49|50>>63 points\nThus, John needs to average 15 + 21 + 19 + 23 + 22 + 24 = 47 points for the team to have 1,000 points\nSo, John needs to score 47 points over the past 4 years = 157 points\nSo, the final score is 157 points over 4=<<157|157|157\nLet x be the team's first 4 seasons in the NFL\nThe total team record over this 4 seasons is\n\nInput:Two people sit on the same side of a wall.

She can give a mark of 70% to two kids with good attendance. She can give a 70% mark to one student who comes late and is disruptive. She can give a 50% mark to another student that shows up late, but is not disruptive. How many marks does the teacher give?\nOutput: The teacher can give a mark of 50% to the student who shows up late. That will be 50 * (35%) + 35 * (70%), which is 270. So the teacher will give a marked of 175.\n(20 * 270 = 450)\nTotal marked of 270 * 70 = 450 * 50 = 450*50 = 350 total\nThe teacher can mark each kid 2 times depending on their performance because half each kid's grade of 50% is 70%, so the total marked of 150 is divided by 50 to give 450 * 2 = 150. If they are both late, then each is marked 3 times: 150*2 = 220*. So the total marked of 250 is divided by 50 to get 150 * 2 = 100. So each student has 100 marks. So they have 150 + 100 = 250.\nIf they are both late, but can be in class in 25 or 50 minutes, then 75% of the grade is retained.\nIf they are less than 25 minutes late, then 80% of the grade is not used.\nIf they are 25 minutes late, then 90% of the grade is used.\nSo total marks retained are 100 + 75 * 25 / 50 = 250\n\nInput 2:A student needs a job and this job will pay $10 per hour for 25 hours of work.

It should be 39 degrees or less.\nIf your heating system is off the entire winter then it is likely your room will be at the correct temperature.\nThere is a slight error, so take the reading every day for a week.\nYou can\u2019t put a thermometer on your head so take the one next to the vent.\nThe reading from your heating system is correct if < 39 degrees but < 39.5\nIf the reading from the thermometer is correct if the reading is above 39\nTake the reading every day for seven days. When it is between 39 and 39.5 the reading is too cold. When it is 40 or below it is too hot. So the measurement is the temperature in K. If the reading is between 40 and 39.5 that is normal and you are getting health insurance.\nWhen it is over 40 you are getting insurance. You should ask your health insurance provider whether you get health insurance if the room is over 40 degrees. They should be able to tell you.\nWhen it is less, you don\u2019t even need to ask.

Kermit wanted to make sure the rabbit loved him so he bought a new camera and a new telescope for the rabbit.\nOutput: Kermit was sure he was making a great choice. The most important thing to do in such a complicated situation was to look for the right partner. He had to ask himself the best question: What was Kermit going through at the time?  Answer: Kermit's only concern was his own well being, not who he was choosing.  What that meant, for Kermit, was that he must focus his efforts on himself more than making sure to have someone special in his life.  So, the most important question to ask himself was: Why was he having such an issue?  He had to ask why he was being affected.  So his answer would be: If you want someone, you should give them what they want.  So, without thinking about it, he had a better idea, and he just gave.  So now it was time to ask: Am I giving the right person enough for them to want me? If the answer to both questions was YES, and you realized that, then the rabbit found love in the person you were with.\nOutput: He made sure the rabbit loved him a lot. When he thought about it, the right answer, the only one that made sense, was to choose a person who made you happy.  Kermit knew he wouldn't be able to give the right answer, or even a good answer to that question, if he was too concerned about who and where he was giving the right answer to.  So now it would be ok to give the right answer and focus solely on yourself.\nThe rabbit chose him because he loved him a lot and she wanted to spend time with him so they could be sure to have some good times together.  But there weren't any problems in their relationship, so it was time for the rabbit to move on to another rabbit.  This left Kermit with an even more important question: If you love someone, you should give the right answer?  So Kermit did the right thing, and gave the rabbit everything she needed.  And, even better, she did the same with Kermit.  After, she was happy and relaxed all the time.  So, the very next time when the rabbit", "answer": "C: pleasing"}

To determine what the goal is, we will have to do several things. First, we will need to determine the number of days we will spend skiing, how long each weekend will be and the number of practices we will have to go through.\nSo we know that we will have to practice for an average of 3 hours per session for an average of 10 sessions per week to achieve our goal\nWe also need to determine the number and length of days away from school we will be expected to miss for a season's practice\nAnd we will also need to determine the length of days from school that we will be expected to attend for a practice session to achieve our goal. So we will know that we will have 3 days per week of class. At the end of our first week, we will have three practices because the next two weeks are a break week and a half. Then, after a break, we will have four practices because the next four weeks are a weekend. After a break, we will go home for a day, then practice for a few more before a game. At the end of it all, we will do five practices.\nSo now that we know how many practices we will have in season, how many days will be spent practicing and the amount of days we will miss for school activities, we must get an estimate for the number of games we will have in season. We will only know how to estimate the number of games once we know the number of practices and what the practice schedule will be.\nSo now that the number of practices and practice schedule have been determined, we will also determine if we will also have to schedule one practice for every game. We will only know this if we know the number of games and the number of practices and how many practices we will need.\n\nInput:The teacher wants to provide her students with a list of questions in the upcoming test.

At the checkout counter, the clerks ask you if you want four packs and one single. How many pieces of gum are in the four packs?\nOutput: The total pieces of gum are divided the sum of $2.75 - $1.75 = <<2x+1x=-2>>56 pieces.\nThe single pieces are split $1.75 + $2.75 = $<<1x+1x=-1>>56 pieces.\nThus the total amount of the single part ($1.75 + $1.75+ $2.75) is the same as the total amount of the packs ($2.75 + $2+ $2).\nSo, 56 + 56 = <<56+56=214>>214 pieces.\nSince 64 = 948, the answer is 214 + 948 = <<948+1048=216>>216 pieces\nThe total weight of the six pieces is 4*4*4^4 so this is 4/9 = <<9-1=5>>5 pieces so the answer is 8\n\nInput: Let\u2019s say you have one hour to spend in a restaurant.

The worst outcome is that if they are aloof at all times they are probably self-important. If they are a friend, they are probably a self-important person who is not a friend.

They would go together on vacations and they would spend all day together every night. If John spent 1,000 fewer days in California, his parents and older sister and her friends in California would probably all travel together. This would be the same number of days the family spent together in the US.   If John spent 300 fewer days in California, instead of three families, only one family would travel. This would be the number of days the family spends apart in the US.\nIn total, John spends 30000 days the US.\nThis is 30,000/300 = 8,000/60 = 400/60\nSo the final answer for the first problem is 400/60 = 15,000/150 = 800/150\nSo in total John spends 75,000 days the US.\nNow the question isn't what is John's experience in the US, it's what is it like for his parents, older sister and her friends?

A indirect point is only counted once a game, since it comes after a goal was scored directly that results in the team finishing the game with only direct goal point, so it is counted only once.

How many weeks does he have to pay off his loan to have it paid off?\nOutput: John needs to have 10 weeks to pay off the loan.\nSuppose that John will make $1200 monthly. That is $30 a week. Assuming that John spends 40 hours a week in the kitchen, he will need $1048 to pay off the loan before he has to work again. He will have to have 40 hours in the kitchen per week. For each hour he gets in the kitchen, he has to pay $17.70. For each hour he buys, he has to pay him $17.\nThus there are 4 weeks $1048 + 17.70 (4/4) = $1657.70\nHe would then have to have $30 each month for about 11 months for it to be paid off his mother-in- laws loan.\nThus, he has $3000 (11 months)/$1200/40= $3380\nThe total amount of money needed is $4580.\nSo the final number is $4580\n\nInput:She only has 11 hours a week to help her children with homework.

He wants a new SUV. The average price is $30,000. He's looking for a new 2012 Cadillac Escalade. If he purchases the SUV in the fall, when the fall sale is available, then he wants the deal of life. With the best price he could receive right now, the only deal of life he could get would be a new car for $19,500. If he purchases the car in the summer, which is the typical price at the time, then he'll likely end up paying over $12,000 more than the average price right now. To be able to get the deal of his life he'll need the price to drop quite a bit. So, how long do you think it will take for the average price to drop from $30,000 to $19,500?\nOutput: At the time, it is likely going to take Max at least 3+ months to find a new deal of his life.\nAt the time there is a good chance he can find a deal of his life, but then it is unlikely he will find it while it is still on sale.\nFor some cars the average price has risen since the beginning of the summer season.

Second, the life jacket has been fitted with a radio receiver so that when the person gets back to their home on land, they are not lost. The radio receiver is very sensitive to changes in radio waves so that the life jacket will detect distress calls and transmit a signal to friends and family. Because the platform is designed to go over 12km, it can actually carry 20 people. But, the platform usually carries 6 and it only takes one person sitting inside to carry the heavier ones. On the launch platform, there are five radio relays. Each relay is connected to a different person inside the pack. Each relay has the ability to receive distress signals, and send a signal to the others. Because each beacon on the platform is in use, there are approximately 1000 people connected with the beacon, making it one of the most vulnerable places. In addition, once the beacon is lost, only those people who have been within the area where the beacon is have a way to contact each other. The beacon is one of the most valued assets found in the ocean because it weighs around 1300 kg.\n\nInput: A teacher is reading a biography of the famous English scientist, Christopher Columbus.

{"text": "B: Exposure, patience, study, cooperation\nThe question \"What is necessary for learning?\" does not specify whether the learner must be alone in his or her learning. For example, one could argue that learning by writing a paper in which the topic is something different from the teacher\u2019s own expertise is a learning by solitude activity.  But another could argue that reading a textbook that was written by a different person than the one who created the book is an activity of knowledge acquisition and that the knowledge is acquired by study.  So the question \"What is necessary\" could be argued from all three points of view.  But I will not address any of these claims directly.\nThe next point is the second of the two categories listed below. Choices: A: knowledge, C: cooperation, D: thought\nThe question \"What will be necessary for knowledge?\" specifies what the learner will need for the knowledge to occur.  To learn a vocabulary word, he must first know the word, then he must hear the word, and then he must write his own explanation.\nThe language of mathematics is no different.  When a new concept is introduced, the new concept must be understood by the learner to become useful.  So, to say, \u201cLearning by your own means\u201d or \u201cLearning by being exposed to knowledge\u201d is to describe how knowledge acquisition occurs.  A few examples:\nExposure: This means that when you learn a new concept from the textbook, you must be exposed to that concept before you can learn it.\nPatience: For the learner to learn something from the textbook is to take time to learn it.\nStudy: The only reason to learn a concept is to know it, but we often fail to study the concepts for the same reason we don't study the concepts in the text.\nCooperate: Cooperation is the act of involving yourself with the process of the learner learning. This means that instead of working on our own, we will work together with you.\nThe question\u2019s third one is \u201cwhat will be necessary for good learning?\u201d  This question is meant to tell the user to choose between learning by observation, which is the use of the experience of others, or using their experiences to prepare them to engage in self-directed learning.  These questions always focus on being involved and prepared for what will be needed.  Choices: A: observation and B: self-directed learning,", "answer": "C: study"}

Any shape that you put your face in, then your whole shape is there.

Choices:  1) 5 seconds 2) 40 minutes 3) 40 hours 4) 2 days 5) 30 years?\nOutput: Smelling a dog is like smelling a person. You see more people than you do dogs.\nWhen you're walking in a circle with 3 people, it's like you have four people all in the same place. Any object you touch, then you have them too.\nWe can say that when you smell a person, what you smell is the person in front of you, and you have him in front of you when you are close to him, but you never touch him, just walk around him.\nWhen you smell a dog, what you smell is not so much the person, but the dog's smell. You put your face in a dog's mouth, then the thing in your mouth is not the dog's, it's your own body odor and you can smell it.\nWhen you smell someone, what you smell is what they're wearing.

{"text": "Where should I put my store?\nIdaho is a small city of 300,000 people with only one mall.  All the other large cities have shopping malls\nIn a big city, I want to maximize the number of potential customers by being located in a mall.\nIf I put my store in a shopping mall, that leaves a little over 200 potential customers.\nAt shopping malls, they are already packed with people for Christmas shopping. So the maximum number for Christmas shopping per Christmas at a shopping mall is 4,400.  Therefore, if I opened my store in the mall, that leaves just over 1,000 potential customers.  At this shopping mall, I can set up shop during holiday rush for Christmas shopping.\nIn a small town, the number of potential customers is much smaller because each person in the mall has to go somewhere else from time to time to do daily household tasks, chores, or to simply relax at the mall with their family or friends.  Therefore, when I ask my customers to shop at my boutique for Christmas and during non shopping seasons, only my very best customers will come to visit me.\nSo, I will choose a mall in a big city instead of a small town.  But, I must choose a shopping mall not in the middle of nowhere but close to a big city and in the middle of the country.  At a big city, all the stores are very expensive and my clothing will be much more affordable.\nDowntown big cities are very touristy to visit, with lots of restaurants and cafes.  Also, the downtown area is full of businesses with lots of money-making opportunities.

It means that one square will take 8*3=1600 seconds total\nSo the final answer to this question is 800\n\nInput: Max and Sophie both like ice creams.

This is a large number of sports for a young child.\nSo, Max and Andrew had at least 10,000 games played together, which more than doubled Max and Andrew's combined total of 1,000 games played together when they were nine years old.  This is roughly 5,000 more games than Max and Andrew combined when they were 9, if I did the math correctly.\nOutput: Let's say Max, Andrew and their soccer teams played at least 5,000 times.  If the average age of Max and Andrew is 10 (10 * 3) and their soccer team is three players, the average of Max and Andrew's game playing time per week is 740 minutes, if each person plays eight games per week.\nSo an additional game would be 1-1.55 = 50 minutes worth of game time per week.\nThus Max and Andrew have a total of 740+120 = 830 minutes of game time.\nSo, Max, Andrew and their teams averaged 1.5 games per week.\nAnd Max and Andrew played a total of 830+120 = 10 hours per week of soccer.\nSo, their time spent playing is >7,500 hours.\nSo the final value of 2,050 is >2,050 x >7040 - >120 = 2,050 x 1090 = 2,050 x 3200\nSo the final answer will be >3050\n\nInput: Two boys play baseball on two teams, each team fielding 5 players.

What is the cost of raising six hens in the barn?\nOutput: If Mary raises six hens for 6 weeks she will produce 1 egg per day\nIf she raises six hens for 12 weeks, she will produce 20 eggs per day\nSince the initial price of a hen is $22.50, hens costs Mary $22.50\nThe cost of one hens egg is $1.40, so Mary's cost of raising 6 hens is $32.40\nIf she raised six hens for 6 years, she would produce $80,000.\nAs long as Mary raised 6 hens, she would not have enough money for the wedding!\nSo the total cost of raising 6 heaps is $32,640.\nSo, the final total is $32,640 / 6 =<<$16,640>>16\nEach hen = $16,640 per week so the total cost of raising six heaps is $72,640, or $16,640 per WEEK =<<$36,640>>36\nThat is $56,384 in total for just six heaps\nSo the final total for six heaps is $56,384/$16,640 = $36,640/(56,384) = $36,640(56)\nIf Mary raised 36 chickens, she would have to sell one hen each week.

So the total cost of raising 36 heaps is $36,640/(38,640) or $36,640$\nThe total cost per week for raising six heaps is equal to $6,640 per week\nSo the total cost per week for six heaps is equal or $24,640 per week or $56,640 / 36 = $24,640 / 36 = <<24,640 / 36=48>>48\nIf Mary raised 96 chickens, she would have $24,960.00 per week to spend on", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

Based on the runway length, the tower guide wire and your velocity, how much can you fly without stopping when the runway reaches the center of gravity or when the velocity exceeds the tower's limit?\nOutput: Keep your velocity at 80 km/h.\nSpeed from tower: 55 km/h.\nFrom base: 35 km/h.\nTower limit: 75 km/h.\nSo your speed is 80 km/h - 55 km/h = 64 km/h.\nYour velocity from tower is 65 km/h - 35 km/h = 48 km/h and your velocity from base is 39 km/h - 8 km/h = 35 km/h. So 64 / 49 = 45\nSo your velocity from tower is 45/35 = 44.\nSo your velocity from base is 30/8 = 28\nSo your velocity from airport is 25/8 = 25\nSo, since your velocity from tower is 44 and your velocity from airport is 28, your velocity", "answer": "B: melting"}

The average price of tops is $15, and the average length of pants is 12 inches. He spends $10 at the second store and, since they have the medium, he spends $5 for the medium plus $20 for shirts. Which store has the average price of clothes at $18?\nOutput: The second store has $3 more in the sale prices compared to the first store.\nSince this second store has the average price for clothing at $18, let x be the average price of clothing for the first store ($30) $3 - $3 = $2 = $2.25 and\nLet y be the average price of tops for the first store.\nOutput:The second store, since it sells the same large pieces of clothing as the first store but at a cheaper price, sells a larger quantity of tops ($300) than the first store ($200).\nSo, the second store, since it has the more expensive item, has x fewer clothing items plus y fewer shirts ($2) than it does the first store ($4).\nSo, the total item count of the second store is greater than the first store ($20)\nSo, the total cost of clothes of the first store is greater than $30 ($2.25) and so, the total cost of clothing of the second store is equal to $0\nSo, the total price of clothing in second store is equal to 0\n\nInput:You found a piece of cardboard with three numbers written on it.

{"text": "suicide\n\nInput:The current price for a new car is $6,500, which the dealer gives you. What do you do?\nOutput: It is impossible to get $6,500 for a new car at a dealership. You must have a local dealership come to you.  Because the salesman cannot come to you, you must pay off the credit card the dealership is using to finance your purchase. If you fail in paying the dealer off your bill after it has been paid in full with interest, you will be stuck with no car for at least two years or until the principal is paid off.\nThe interest rates on credit cards are very high.  As long as you pay the amount due every month for the card, it will be gone.  A bank can take away your financial future with a single mistake.\nSo, the dealer will never know you have a finance company paying your bill in full every month.  The dealer will put $6,500 in your bank account and let you take the car only to repay that amount after you have paid off the dealer.  The dealer will never know a deal is being worked out until it is too late.  So, you'll have to trust the dealer will pay you back since there is no way to verify this.  After it rains, you will lose the car.  The dealer will tell you you are responsible for the damages because you took out the finance company.  But, they will also have the credit card bill, the bill with the finance company and even the finance company's account statements to go along with the statement showing you will repay the loan.  Then, the seller will claim the car is in bad shape. When you tell the dealer the car has already been sold, he will simply say, \"Well, you didn't pay.\" The car will be lost.\nSo the dealer's job is to buy a car for you. Nowhere does it say you are responsible for paying it back.  The dealer is trying to make you stay on the hook for the loan rather than you simply paying it in full.  A dealer will have to make several decisions before the car, including picking a title company and getting the car appraised.  The dealer should not have to pay for an appraisal because the car is lost.\nSo the dealers trying to make you stick with the car.  You could just walk away in tears, tell the dealer he can sell it and move on.\nSo why not just walk away?", "answer": "E: kill yourself"}

How closely do you think the child should be to his big sister if his mother has him?\nOutput: The child can't be too close to his big sister's baby brother. He has to have someone he's close to, but not too close. He'll miss the baby brother too much.\nOutput: The baby is right up to the edge of his bed. No, just he's on his bed.  He can't be too close though. Otherwise his sister will cry. His big sister has a baby. She has to be as far away from it when she sees it as possible.\nOutput: The child's mother loves him to death.  He's her only child.  She knows how much she loves him.  She's not going anywhere without him.  So her idea for how close the child should be to the baby is not to be too close.\nOutput: If the child was to be with his big sister the day his mother dies what is the most likely distance he should be?\nOutput: He should be far away enough to not miss his big sister but close enough to feel like she always has his back.\nOutput: Do you think that the child will be willing to be close?\nOutput: No, the child won't be. He'll be too afraid.\nOutput: He can't be close enough to the baby brother without being too close to his mother.

He ordered a medium hamburger and a small soda. The waitress gave him a cup of coffee as soon as he walked in. When he went to pull his cup of coffee away, the waitress grabbed it to protect it from being damaged if it were to spill on the floor. In his mind, this sounds like a good idea. Why is the customer being responsible for the waitress's actions?\nOutput: The customer had put the cup of coffee in a metal cup holder, and was pulling it towards him.  When the waitress grabbed onto the metal cup holder, she bumped into the man.  He pushed against her, and she hit into him.\nIn his mind, that looks like a good idea.  Why is the customer responsible for the waitress's reactions?\nOutput: The order of food was:\nMedium hamburger\nSmall soda\nWhile she was pulling the cup away from the man to the server, the cup was bumped into the man's shoulder.  They both hit into each other in this way.\nIn his mind that looks like a good  idea.  Why is he responsible for the waitress' attitude?\nOutput: The restaurant has a policy of only charging for food when it is not touched, as an insurance claim. When customers have drinks that are not touched, they cannot sue the restaurant. These drinks are a waste of money.  In theory, the cost is more revenue than customers lose by not having drinks.  If they were to do that, they would lose more money than they gained by customers getting drinks for free.  The servers' policy is to give customers drinks as soon as they enter the restaurant, but without touching the food or drink.  The server is responsible for making certain that customers do", "answer": "B: populated area"}

He must use 8 pieces of toilet paper at a time.  How many will he need?\nOutput: Bob can use 8 rolls of toilet paper and save $20 because, per roll, eight rolls costs $20.\nFor every roll Bob uses, he must then use 8 more rolls\nSo he can save $40 by using 8 rolls for a total of 16 rolls\nAt that point, Bob must use 16 more rolls.\nSo if he uses 16 more rolls, then he has saved $80\nSaving $80 per roll would be $500 after 16 rolls\nSo Bob can save a total of $1,650 by saving 8 more rolls\nBob can then buy 6 more rolls\nIt then takes Bob 32 rolls to purchase 4 rolls.\nSo then, Bob must use 36 rolls to purchase 6 rolls (or 32 rolls if he saves 15).\nThus, Bob needs 54 rolls = 54 \u00d7 16 = 132 rolls.\nThus, Bob spends $764.60 per roll\nSo, the final price per roll is $764.60\nIn total, Bob needs $2,672.60\nSo, Bob will need 54 rolls to save $1,640\n\nInput: Adam has a total of $50 in his bank which is $2,500.

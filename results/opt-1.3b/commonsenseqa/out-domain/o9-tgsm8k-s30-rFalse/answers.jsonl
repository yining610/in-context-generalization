The average trip time for a 20-horsepower car is 19 minutes, so a fuel efficiency of 18 miles per gallon would be required.  The average car mileage in a car of 20 horsepower is 16 miles per gallon, so the fuel efficiency of 23 miles per gallon would be needed to make up the difference in miles traveled between the two cars.

He checked the forecast with the weatherman and found that they forecasters weren\u2019t right.  He was worried, but they were forecasting dry conditions for several days to follow, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about drought.  So he went back inside and checked the weather again.  This time it was raining!  He thought to himself, \u201cWell, it\u2019s raining on our party, so all is well at least.\u201d  He felt a little silly when he walked past his party and wondered how they were going to get through the rain. His concern and nervousness about the rain started to dissipate when an umbrella was brought out from under the porch!  It started to sprinkle and the rain stopped immediately, so Bob and his guests celebrated the sunshine by getting together to play some games, eat some cake, and have a barbecue!  Bob was looking forward to that barbecue, so he took it to the barbeque to eat it.  When they were finishing the barbecue, a group ran up and ran into the house to get some souvenirs.  One of the guests started to laugh, and Bob, his dad, and a friend of the family began playing a game to see who could figure out who was who in the group.  As the game went on one of the tourists started to complain that it wasn\u2019t as fun as when he and his wife stayed in the party by the fire pit.  Bob felt guilty.  Why he didn\u2019t say anything when he first noticed the rain when they were in the porch with their umbrella in hand seems to never make sense to him, but the man was happy at the time and that took him back to his original point \u2013 that it made the day better!  Bob apologized to him, but the guy told him not to worry about it.  He didn\u2019t even remember the rain having stopped raining except when he saw his friends and family celebrating by the porch!  Awww, how sweet!  After that, Bob and friends went back outside to play with the weather, and to cheer everyone else up when they saw that", "answer": "C: butterflies"}

He got out of his truck and went to walk around for some dry clothes.  He came back and noticed water seeping out of the drain pipes of the sump pump.  John couldn\u2019t figure out why his toilet suddenly backed up.  He could tell that there had been a sudden rise in the water level.  He asked his neighbor and they found a leak in the roof of the house.  John rushed home and replaced the leak.  He pulled up his driveway to a water filled ditch.  Not wanting to spend another dollar on fixing anything, John went back to work.  After work he decided to clean up in the yard.  By the time he finished cleaning up, the sun was shining.  He decided to go back outside and look at the water level.  Before he could get near the back of his truck, a wave of water washed out John.  He could see the water going down the street from where he was standing.  He called his wife and told her of his experience.  She immediately called her insurance agent and told him to cover any expenses related to cleaning up and repairing his truck.  John sent a notice to his tenants.  After all was said and done, he paid his employees $300 to clean his house up.  When his repair contractor called to tell him how much material he had received, John realized that all he had paid them was for the water damage.  He called again and informed him that the water damage had cost him $5,000.00 more than he had originally expected.  The contractor agreed to give all the money he had paid, $3000.  It cost John an extra $5,000.  After all his expenses were covered, John realized that he had nothing left over for his workers\u2019 compensation insurance.  The insurance company refused to insulate his workers\u2019 compensation so he had no choice but to pay for his own insurance.

While the police were investigating, the neighbors finally found out what they would be doing to help out.  The neighbors offered to pay John for all the water damage he had suffered.

{"text": "23\nOutcome: 16\n\nInput: It is possible to have your hand raised after only one step? Outcome: 11\n\nInput: A father has three sons. Each son is married. The father has given one son to each son. The father wants to know the difference between the total amount that the father has given these three sons over the years and the figure that he has paid for each sons. The total has increased over the years. The son has got married. The wife has got pregnant. She wants a divorce. When would the father stop giving money to son number two and what would that be his total figure?\nSolution:\n1: If the father has given son number two $500.00 on his 10 th birthday, in 10 years he will have given son number two $632.00.\n2: $600.00 was his total gift to son number two. On his 12 th birthday his father would give son number two $640.00.\n3: $1240.00 from his father\u2019s total gift to son number one would be his figure in the next 10 years.\n4: $1240.24 will be his figure in the year 2022 when his father will no longer be giving gifts to son number one.\n5: In this year the father will give son number two $1480.00. That is his figure for son number two in the coming years.\nSolution:\n1. He has given son number two only $250.00. He has given son two\u2019s wife $1000.00 and son two has got married. To say that his total amount given to son number two will be $250.00 is wrong. That means that the father has paid $2500.00 per year and given both his sons $1000.00 at same time. This means that total amount he has given to son two in the last 10 years is $3000. This is not correct. Therefore, the total sum that the father has given to son number two in this year will not be $3280.24 but instead will be $1480.24. Hence the correct figure will be: $1480.24 + $250.00 = $2000.00.\n\nInput: There are 5 employees at the office. The total salary of the entire office, for 5 year tenure, is $8060.96.

However, an important area is child custody.  In Illinois, a divorce decree can be legally entered if the estranged couple reach an agreement on the custody of the minor child.  Parents who have fought often try to agree on the custody of a child, but not always.  The court is not always concerned with the family\u2019s agreement.  The court can be influenced by a former spouse\u2019s desire to be financially stable.  Often, the judge grants an uncontested court-ordered divorce or annulment when the husband no longer wishes to maintain a relationship with the woman or child.  Often divorce or annulment is a last resort.\n\nInput:The wife needs 20 pairs of shoes.  She only buys 10 pairs and returns the rest.

I gave mine some suggestions, but for a first grader I made a few of my own.\n\nIn my suggested answer, the student is supposed to have the ability to make an intuitive guess about the time the cost of the rental is calculated.\nWhen I first taught this problem, I always told the students to be careful with their guesses. I told them they couldn\u2019t guess how much would they pay using a sliding scale as their guide, since the first week could cost less than the last. But, I also reminded them that I didn\u2019t have to tell them how much they would pay. If they didn\u2019t have that ability with their own answer, maybe I could help them out. I told my kids they didn\u2019t need to know how much would they save. If I gave them an answer, they could assume they would save the most amount of money.\nI tried one of my own suggestions. If I had seen my students answer my first question correctly, I could have asked them to solve mine. If they had solved my question correctly, I could ask them a question based on their first answer. So, I suggested to my kids that if they answered one of my answers correctly, I would give them some number to work with. They were shocked at how easy this was. They also came to know that if I gave them an answer that appeared to have a lot of information to know, even though their answer was correct, I could give them a hint of how much they could save if they answered correctly. Since they know that they need to use a sliding scale to calculate a rental price, they can figure out how much they can save.\n\nNext time I read this problem, I might start to ask my students to provide a different number for the amount of money they would save when asking their own questions. With some variation in the answer, they could learn that the answers they give do have additional information. If I ask them to give me an estimate of how much they can save, maybe I can ask them to say what level of detail they", "answer": "A: feel sorry"}

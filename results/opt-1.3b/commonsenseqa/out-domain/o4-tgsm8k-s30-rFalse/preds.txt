They loved their condo, but they felt the property manager kept them in the basement of the condo more than they would like.  Their condo bills came to $1,000 monthly.  However, they were still happy to have their own kitchen and bathrooms.  They asked the property manager to allow tenants to rent a 2-bedroom condo in the condo that they had rented.  The condo manager said she would be happy to allow them to rent a 2-bedroom condo in the condo their current partner rented.  The property manager said that renters in the condo they rented would have to share the living space with the other tenants, which the young couple already felt was annoying, so they made their decision to terminate their renters agreement and get out of the condo.  What do you think this couple made of this decision?  What advice do you have for them?<n>Output: C<n><n>Input: A young couple were planning on going to Europe in June, but when the trip was put off until September, they could not find a suitable accommodation and were willing to pay up to $100 per night to stay with a family member.  They had rented a place on Airbnb for $125 per night, but felt that it would still be too high, so they found a place locally called 'The Little Farm on the Bay' that was offered at a discounted rate - $48 per night for a 2-bedroom apartment for 12 days.  They were happy to stay for just long enough to move their car back into the garage and prepare for their trip to Iceland.  They felt that they had saved $700 dollars compared to a $2,000 Airbnb rental, and they felt that if they were going to spend the entire time staying in Iceland, why would they want to stay in a place that the company that owned the house they rented was already subletting?<n>Output: D<n>This case seems like a no brainer.  The couple already knew that they would spend a lot of money, which is why they found an inexpensive Airbnb, but they were able to cut costs by not putting in the time and effort they expected before deciding to buy the place.

He gets off the plane in Utah only to find John’s company had already purchased the land rights and would need to be remodeled to accommodate the new location. The new location will now be the Gourmet Pizza Ranch in Santa Monica, California.  John finds out he now becomes the president of his new company and that his new boss, Mr. DeMille, is now a personal friend.  Mr. DeMille tells him he made a mistake, that he should have bought the land already and he did not need to move all his staff and food to that new location.  Mr. DeMelle and John decide to stay in Los Angeles and work together building the first “Gourmet Pizza Palace”.  The first concept involves a “Gourmet Burger Lounge” for guests where they enjoy the flavors from their “Gourmet Pizza Ranches”.  As the company grows over the years, more locations are built all over the world, with the main location serving as the headquarters for “Gourmet Pizza World” and the new Gourmet Pizza Ranch in the Santa Monica, California area. After eight years, the two are married and they have three children.<n>Solution: (cannot be used if none of the choices give the answer)<n><n>Input: After his company is bought by another.

Eric is the president of his fraternity, Phi Tau. He has asked Joe, a Phi Tau man with a similar membership, to host him at the fraternity house for an upcoming gala honoring the Phi Tau brothers and his son. When Joe accepts, Eric decides to invite Joe’s family.  The gala is scheduled for July 18.  When Eric arrives, he finds out that the house is booked.  He feels guilty because his wife and son are at home in the same room, while his fraternity brothers are going to the gala.  He offers to have the gala at his brother’s house where nobody would be there for his wife and son.  When Joe refuses to agree, Eric decides to go home and tell his wife and son. He then decides to inform his fraternity brothers of what plan he will be making. When the fraternity brothers see that he is not going to invite his mother, brother, or son, they feel the same guilt as Eric did. When Eric goes home, he tells his wife about Joe’s decision to stay. His wife feels sorry for the situation, but is more understanding because she believes in his responsibility as a fraternity leader.

Eric apologizes to Joe for the whole sequence of events; his family, his fraternity brothers, and his son.

After watching all her friends graduate, Bob decided he wasn’t ready for “big” celebrations.  After all, they were only 10th graders, he thought.  Now, Bob would be hosting a small, intimate family reunion party.  The guests had to be invited three months in advance, Bob said.  Bob also wanted the party to be a surprise, so it would have to be low budget and held in a local community center.  Bob had purchased enough decorations to decorate the building for the night; he was going to surprise his friends by having his family join him and his two grandchildren at the party.  Bob found a $35.00 bill hidden in his son-in-law’s purse, but he also discovered that the car he rented for his surprise party had crashed.  He spent the next 6 hours driving back to the scene of the crash and recovering the rental car.  He learned that one of the four people inside the car was seriously injured, and that the other two people who were passengers, including the couple Bob was going to surprise, had died.  At first, Bob was angry at the couple for letting him down, but he decided to forgive them because they had sacrificed their vacation time to be a part of his family celebration.

A team of meteorologists and atmospheric chemists is located in the storm damage zone. They calculate the change in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide in each of the following gases: hydrocarbons (naphtha, gasoline), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; then they measure the concentrations of each gas in the air during the days of the worst storm activity in an attempt to determine the total change in atmospheric nitrogen dioxide levels due to the hurricanes. For the nitrogen in each of these gases, do each group determine that the concentration is: a) more than 100 times greater than is typical during hurricane activity; b) 25 times greater than expected; or c) 35 times greater than expected for the type of hurricane?<n>Output:B<n><n>Example 8B: The group of meteorologists and atmospheric science chemists calculate the changes in the concentration of nitrogen oxides on June 14 – 15, 2003, in Galveston, Texas, due to three hurricanes which arrived over a period of three days. The concentrations of each gas in each gas cloud are compared and found to be greater than the concentrations normally observed during hurricane activity. The group then calculates the total change in nitrogen dioxide levels due to hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Ike. The change in the nitrogen in gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide is: a) more that 100 times greater than is usual during hurricanes; b) 25 times higher than would be expected for hurricanes; and c) 35 times higher than would be considered normal in the summer months. As a result, their analysis indicates that there is a 50% chance that these nitrogen oxides concentrations would be higher than 50ppm under 100% hurricane force wind conditions. Thus, their analysis shows that the hurricane increased the concentration by an estimated 50 ppb and changed the gas cloud by more than 100% due to the Hurricane Katrina. The group estimates it is unlikely a storm like this would happen again in recorded history, and that it would be considered virtually certain that the concentration would not be higher under 100% hurricane force winds.<n>Output: A<n>NOTE: The hurricane had an unusual location in the Gulf of Mexico and in coastal Gulf islands, thus contributing to its unusual rise in concentrations. This is a unique type of hurricane that is difficult to predict and, consequently, difficult to control.<n>

What are the problems in the car-rental business?<n>Output: No Car, No Money, No Car, No Money and No Car!!!<n><n>The three main reasons are:1.  The car rental people don’t have a reliable way to find customers2.  The car rental business is saturated with competition from the car-rental agency business3.  The car rental customers want their car, not someone else’s<n><n>To address any of these barriers, you may want to consider some of the following ideas:<n>(a)  Use the internet - there are sites where you can find a lot of other car rental options you can use as your primary source of information about the rental car industry<n><n>(b)  Set up a new company - a car rental company that does the same kinds of things a car rental agency does but has a different business model - that is to say, they offer short term rental, not long term rental, along with a broader variety of other rental types and uses the internet to market themselves<n><n>If your new company does not have those characteristics - you may still be able to make a business out of short term rentals, just not at the level of a car rental company.<n><n>(c)  Consider establishing a new company - do you have a college degree? Is this your first job? Is it profitable? Can you start a new car rental business where you had to find enough new customers to sustain yourself for a year or two at 1% or less gross rental profit?<n><n>(d)  Consider a new company and an old companies merger - which would be the best situation? Do they meet all your criteria, or would it be more profitable to start a competing new company and create the new culture there, rather than attempt to merge with the old one?

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n>Output:		 A beaver has a home made for 3-4 months.  The beaver builds 3 to 4 houses made of logs, boards, lumber, bricks and soil.  The home is large enough to be useful and not look like a shack or cabin.  One house is a 3 x 3 with a large hole for a door 1 foot in diameter. Then, the logs are fitted together and connected together.  The house is  square and  high.  The homes are 6 inches thick.  The home is  high and 12 inches wide.  If a 5 ft tall human walks into the woods, the human will be 6 inches taller than the beaver.  The beaver could be seen with his hands on the side of the home.  A friend of the beaver’s son saw the beaver, with his hands on the sides of the home, and he was 5 inches taller than the beavers son.  So, the beavers son is more than 6 inches taller than the children.  A house has no walls.  The home is 3 x 3 but each room is  3 x 6. The room is 6 inches thick and the house is   wide and 12 inches thick  The house is covered with 1 ply plywood and is painted to look like mud and it is painted white.  A beaver is 6 inches tall when standing up.  He can’t see his feet.  A 1” thick board is a common building material in Canada.  A woodchuck can jump up to 6 feet and a half and a 1” thick board can be jump a further 5 feet. A woodchuck could jump twice, as long as its legs were straight. A 1” thick piece of wood will last 6 months.  The woodchuck can jump 12 feet, but it can’t be seen. The woodchuck can’t jump when a light shine on it. If the light were on both sides the light will shine on the woodchucks face at the same time.  A woodchipper can pick up a large pile of dirt that would take an animal 20 minutes to gather, but it can remove enough dirt to fill a small room.  The woodchipper can pick apart a 3 x 2 board into 4 x 1 boards or 2 x 6 boards. The woodchipper can’t see the pieces, however the pieces are still connected when they are picked up. A woodchipper can only

The court appointed his attorney to represent him during his trial. During trial, the court asked each of the witnesses of the crime what part of the city they lived in.

The candidate agrees to the offer.  After seven days, the tenant finds a new tenant for the house.  The tenant wants to give the house to his friend, but it is too expensive.  They tell him that they will give the house to friends if he will just accept less than $250.00.  The man says that he can accept $250.00 if he feels bad about the way he treats the person he is renting the house to.  The man tells the new tenant that he is glad to have done the right thing and that the people who wanted to sell the house will take good care of the home.  He tells the new tenant that the new tenant will be in charge of making the home better.  The new tenant moves in within 36 hours.  The new tenant’s sister tells her family that her new cousin is being moved into the house with the rest of her family.  The new tenant tells his family that her family was supposed to be there a long time ago, but they got sick and left while she was out of town.  She tells her family that they came to town hoping to visit some friends.  The family starts to get angry because they never gave the house to anyone.  The new tenant gives her family a new home in the form of more bedrooms, more money, and a new family that doesn’t have to worry about where they left a house.  So, what’s the problem?  The new tenant is happy, the other family is not.  What is the right thing to do?  Who is right?  This is a moral question.  You may use moral issues in each problem or in each paragraph as long as they are clearly referenced and explained.<n>For example, if the new tenant goes out to buy some bread he sees the bread on the market. He decides to buy it. His family is angry that he didn’t contact them first.  Is she wrong because that is how things were in the past?  If she went out to buy the bread, was it her good judgment that led her to buy the bread?  Who has the better judgement?  Is it her family or the new tenant?<n>If you are answering with D, choose A. If you are answering with E, choose B. If you are answering correctly, you will choose A.<n>You may not discuss

What is the annual cost in dollars associated with that?<n>Output: 40,000 USD<n><n>In a business of this nature, it would be difficult to find people who wish to invest more money in a business that does not pay well.  If you believe the business will continue to work, then invest more money into the business because, without more money in the business, there is no way to grow it.  If you know the company pays $300 per month and your business cost you $60,000 for the first year, you must invest $480 per month to sustain the business.  The business you have will likely continue producing the type of results you want.<n><n>The number of dollars you spend on something determines what you will get out of the product.  If you buy a new car, you pay a premium for it because it costs more money to make.  The premium you pay for a new car is what you get the car for.  If you buy the car at a dealer, you purchase it at the price your dealership sold it for.  The value (in money, in other words) of the car you bought is based on your price.  This is similar to an investment in a business.  If you purchase a stock at a lower initial cost, then increase the price over time, then you will get a premium for that investment.  The price of stocks and bonds is dependent upon the price at which they're purchased.  At a lower initial cost, you will find more buyers who may purchase the stocks or bonds at a greater valuation than they would for the stock at a higher initial cost.  The initial price of a stock will be determined by the initial cost to produce the stock plus the cost to get rid of the stock once it sells.  Some investors pay the

My estimated calculation is based on the distance traveled by a car traveling 60 miles to the nearest golf course, and the number of golfers per green course (18, 5-iron).  I am assuming that Jack takes the time to stop every two hours and walk around each green.  In the Northern tip of Georgia, where Jack is going to be is at 2,200 mi. in 2 hours, i.e., he will take 3 hours and 1 minute to drive from the tip to the city for which he is traveling. In Atlanta, Jack could go in about an hour.  Assuming that he travels at approximately 50mph, that means that he could drive from the tip in one hour.  Assuming that his speed goes up to 55 mph, that would make the trip only one and one-half hours.<n><n>Input: 1) He drives a Honda Civic. 2) He takes the bus. 3) He rides the subways. 4) He rides the subway over bridges. 5) He drives his own car. 6) He drives his truck. 7) He walks. 8) He rides his bike. 9) He bike rides.<n><n>Output: 1) He goes over some bridges and then rides a bike to work.

The total rental cost will include taxes as well as a service charge (a fee for extra services that are not included) and add-ons such as GPS mapping and a phone hookup. If you’re booking a short trip with 8 people, you can rent any vehicle and pay whichever one’s less. For a 15-person trip, you can rent up to 12 vehicles and pay the maximum price.

If, however, you’d like the rental company to call you to let you know the rental vehicle is ready to go, contact them directly to request a reservation.  The cost of renting a car increases with vehicle capacity. A 15-passenger vehicle would cost about $50 per day depending on how many people are on the reservation.

Just think: What is the cost of buying and maintaining the equipment, shipping it, and paying employees? Would you rather pay an extra $100 to avoid shipping, or save money on a less reliable machine? I have an idea and am willing to give up my time for other participants.<n><n>#3 is about transportation which is why it seems to me that it is easiest to build a business from home, without the need for equipment. You can still purchase the parts and pay for employees. On the other hand, the overhead is huge on a farm and there are a lot more ways that it can go horribly wrong than simply getting into a car and driving for several hours.<n>Also, you can build a similar business with some help from friends and neighbors without the need for expensive equipment.<n><n>Answer:<n>In a nutshell, I agree: you can build a business from home. However, if you're operating a service-a business - you have to have capital. You can't "go it alone" and hope to pull it off.<n><n>I will agree with #1, on that front. I think it's much easier to make money with a service, but the only problem with that is you can do it right in your front yard and still get paid for it.<n>Also, you CAN build a service business out of your front yard, but you are going to have to be very patient, get others involved, and perhaps provide some incentives. You will probably need to offer something of worth in exchange for the use of your yard. This is what a farmer, a plumber, and some electricians do, for example.<n>In regards to "lifestyle choice" and "decisions", I completely agree that many decisions like that are personal, and you may well do what most people would do. However, there will be times when you will have decisions that have an impact on everyone,

Housing prices rise and people can pay their rent.  I am thinking of creating a program that would encourage poor people to move into government housing.  But what do you think?<n>Output: Housing prices rise in the areas affected by hurricanes. Some are built in areas that cost less then the area is worth, and the owners will sell them for cheaper then the area is worth.  Some areas have few people living there so it will take some time for prices to rise.  If people stay in area after the hurricane they will get flooded and lose all their belongings.

She can’t afford a car rental and lives with her parents.  The local rental car firm charges $40.00 per day to rent the same car twice.  The rental company charges $60,000 for two weeks to rent this car.  She will need two cars to take her family of six to her parent’s house for the next two weeks.  She gets a $400 loan from her parents and pays interest of $240 a month after her first two weeks.  During this time, she can’t use the loan and pays a $400 credit card bill.  It turns out the car rental company has a sale offer on this car until November 30.  Jane is too scared to rent this car, so she is forced to stay with her parents, despite having already purchased the one that her father owns.  The credit card company wants her to pay $1,000 and will be charging her interest of $200 a month until she does so.  When she finally gets a rental car for $10 less each day than she is paying to her parents, she must drive the exact same route to work each day or will be fined $200 per day.  The final penalty is that she can’t see her father for two weeks because all the hotels cost between $150 and $325 per night.  It’s been three weeks since Jane’s stay at her parents and she hasn’t seen her father.  The credit company is not charging interest until she pays up.  After an additional two weeks go by and the car rental firm has not renewed the sale offer on this car, Jane is forced to return home.  The credit company’s credit card company now wants Jane to pay the $1,000 in interest and then an additional $200 a month.  Jane can’t afford the additional $200 a month in interest and she loses both cars in one go.  Jane loses all of the money invested in this deal and she’s finally forced to leave her parents.<n>Input:  In a similar situation, Michael rented a car. He rented it and drove it for 8 hours.

The company, which was formed in 1979, owes $200.000.000,00,000,000, and another $30.000.000,0000,000.  The company is owned by a wealthy oil magnate and is based in California.  The company hired an outside contractor to assess the debt’s worth.  The estimate of its worth was that if all the lawsuits were enforced the company owed $9,000,000,0000.  If all the lawsuits were not enforced the company owed $1,500,000,0000.00.  Therefore the total debt owed is $1,500,00,000,0000.01.  This is the largest loan taken out in history.  The company is currently insolvent and under receivership.  The receiver is in charge of all of the assets of the company and has been appointed to represent the companies interests in all court decisions.  The company is asking the receiver to foreclose the house and all other assets.  If all of the assets of a company were sold off, how much would it sell for?  The receivers are asking for $50,000,000,000000.00.  If all of its assets were sold off it would be worth $100,000,000,03.  Would the receivers give the directors an extension of up to six more months to repay, or would they take possession and begin foreclosing?

I hope to be practicing this new way to evaluate my ideas on a weekly basis."  Annie<n>"This was an awesome lesson in which I learned how to evaluate the importance of different questions in an analysis.  I loved practicing the topic of time and trying to think of different ways to evaluate the usefulness of a question in a given situation.  Thank you for bringing some extra math into this class!" A.A.<n>"This was a good lesson that provided a great example of how I need to keep my logic separate from my opinion or preference." D.B.<n>"I have to be able to do things in logical order, because my brain is very inconsistent and at times gets confused if it's thrown on top of one thing.  You also told me to think of a multiple-choice question first, so I did!  This way I can try them all and then come back and solve it." C.K.<n><n>This lesson was an exercise in self-evaluation. Self-evaluation is part of the process of learning, and students who are able to self-evaluate have what are called "reflexive teachers," like Mr. Sisler. In reflexivity, we are not motivated to improve one particular skill, but we are motivated to evaluate our own competency. The reflexive teacher is someone who can recognize those things in us that are good (i) and bad (ii). By this reflexive teacher, we can improve the parts of us that we need to make good decisions for ourselves and the parts of us that are bad. What follows is an exercise in self-valuation. When I first started writing my observations about this lesson, the first item I listed was, "I want more problems." However, in looking back at my work, these comments have evolved into, "I don't want to keep working on the same thing." I've decided to write all the things that I'm doing for this unit now instead of working on them all at once. This way I can focus on one thing at a time but not get too overwhelmed by my pile of chores. For me, the most important lesson out of this lesson is the habit of self-evaluaton--self-evaluation. This habit

For example, 4.45% of the population under 35 is not in work, 4.7% have less than 10 months of work experience, 4.5% has less than 2 years of work experience, 8% has more than 4 years of work experience, and 8.6% has a PhD or higher on their resume.  There are two types of labor markets: labor force participation and unemployment.  For the purposes of this activity, labor force participation is the percentage of adults in age 16 and over who are employed or actively seeking employment.  The number of unemployed Americans who are aged 16 and over is the number of people who are out of work, or unemployed.  Unemployment includes only those individuals who are actively seeking employment, not those unemployed who are not in a job.  The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the age 16+, employed population (or of the age 16+ working-age population), who have participated in or actively sought employment.  The number that participated (or actively sought) includes all unemployed in this analysis but only those who were actively seeking employment.  Unemployment rate is the percentage of unemployed individuals in the total population of the age 16+ employed population who are currently unemployed.<n><n>Select the right answer from the correct answers or click the "Next" button to continue.

You would like to do a feasibility study which evaluates your current building capacity, its energy efficiency, and its structural integrity. Your goal is to determine if the building itself will be able to handle growing agricultural needs and an increase in the number of livestock animals you are currently raising.  What should you do?<n>Output: 400<n><n>Input:You are raising chickens for the market. To feed them, you feed them grains at 6 pounds per pound. You need to use less grains if you want to sell more chicken.    Which method is more economical?  Output: 310<n><n>Input and Output: You are a veterinarian. You have two small dogs. One dog had diarrhea. You gave the dog one teaspoon of liquid amoxicillin. You gave your second dog one teaspoon of liquid antibiotic. Which would you feed the dog?<n><n>The answer is "one", because you always use the least expensive option to do a study in the lab and then make a selection for the case study.<n><n>The answer is A, too, because sometimes one person can give antibiotics to one small dog only, but they never get to the question "which dog will get the same level as the other?"<n><n>The answer is B, because if you feed both dogs the same amount of amoxillin, the dog receiving more would likely be infected with a staph infection (staphylococcus aureus), requiring an early course of antibiotics so the infection does not spread to the skin and liver. Giving the same amount of antibiotic to dogs that need more is not recommended because it would be a waste of antibiotics. Giving equal amounts of antibiotic to dogs that do not need as much is important because the less antibiotic you feed to dogs that do not have a strong infection, the lower the likelihood of having a severe infection develop later.<n><n>If you feed the dog one teaspoon of amoxicillin, but give it one teaspoon of antibiotic that may not be as effective, you run the risk that you may accidentally give the dog more medication than is necessary—it becomes more difficult to distinguish between the two. In that case, some bacteria may get the upper hand, which could make it more difficult for your dog to get clean. You are likely to spread the infection in the process, so it would be best to provide adequate amounts of antibiotic to dogs of all types and sizes.<n><n>If you give the dog two teaspoons of amoxicillin but give

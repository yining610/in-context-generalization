{"text": "A\n\nInput:A group of researchers is studying the effects of a hurricane on an area of the Gulf Coast. A team of meteorologists and atmospheric chemists is located in the storm damage zone. They calculate the change in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide in each of the following gases: hydrocarbons (naphtha, gasoline), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; then they measure the concentrations of each gas in the air during the days of the worst storm activity in an attempt to determine the total change in atmospheric nitrogen dioxide levels due to the hurricanes. For the nitrogen in each of these gases, do each group determine that the concentration is: a) more than 100 times greater than is typical during hurricane activity; b) 25 times greater than expected; or c) 35 times greater than expected for the type of hurricane?\nOutput:B\n\nExample 8B: The group of meteorologists and atmospheric science chemists calculate the changes in the concentration of nitrogen oxides on June 14 \u2013 15, 2003, in Galveston, Texas, due to three hurricanes which arrived over a period of three days. The concentrations of each gas in each gas cloud are compared and found to be greater than the concentrations normally observed during hurricane activity. The group then calculates the total change in nitrogen dioxide levels due to hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Ike. The change in the nitrogen in gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide is: a) more that 100 times greater than is usual during hurricanes; b) 25 times higher than would be expected for hurricanes; and c) 35 times higher than would be considered normal in the summer months. As a result, their analysis indicates that there is a 50% chance that these nitrogen oxides concentrations would be higher than 50ppm under 100% hurricane force wind conditions. Thus, their analysis shows that the hurricane increased the concentration by an estimated 50 ppb and changed the gas cloud by more than 100% due to the Hurricane Katrina. The group estimates it is unlikely a storm like this would happen again in recorded history, and that it would be considered virtually certain that the concentration would not be higher under 100% hurricane force winds.\nOutput: A\nNOTE: The hurricane had an unusual location in the Gulf of Mexico and in coastal Gulf islands, thus contributing to its unusual rise in concentrations.

What would you like to know about the management culture of a European company?\nOutput: 20\n\nInput. What are the problems in the car-rental business?\nOutput: No Car, No Money, No Car, No Money and No Car!!!\n\nThe three main reasons are:1.  The car rental people don\u2019t have a reliable way to find customers2.  The car rental business is saturated with competition from the car-rental agency business3.  The car rental customers want their car, not someone else\u2019s\n\nTo address any of these barriers, you may want to consider some of the following ideas:\n(a)  Use the internet - there are sites where you can find a lot of other car rental options you can use as your primary source of information about the rental car industry\n\n(b)  Set up a new company - a car rental company that does the same kinds of things a car rental agency does but has a different business model - that is to say, they offer short term rental, not long term rental, along with a broader variety of other rental types and uses the internet to market themselves\n\nIf your new company does not have those characteristics - you may still be able to make a business out of short term rentals, just not at the level of a car rental company.\n\n(c)  Consider establishing a new company - do you have a college degree? Is this your first job? Is it profitable? Can you start a new car rental business where you had to find enough new customers to sustain yourself for a year or two at 1% or less gross rental profit?\n\n(d)  Consider a new company and an old companies merger - which would be the best situation? Do they meet all your criteria, or would it be more profitable to start a competing new company and create the new culture there, rather than attempt to merge with the old one?", "answer": "D: feel happy"}

If you believe the business will continue to work, then invest more money into the business because, without more money in the business, there is no way to grow it.  If you know the company pays $300 per month and your business cost you $60,000 for the first year, you must invest $480 per month to sustain the business.  The business you have will likely continue producing the type of results you want.\n\nThe number of dollars you spend on something determines what you will get out of the product.  If you buy a new car, you pay a premium for it because it costs more money to make.  The premium you pay for a new car is what you get the car for.  If you buy the car at a dealer, you purchase it at the price your dealership sold it for.  The value (in money, in other words) of the car you bought is based on your price.  This is similar to an investment in a business.  If you purchase a stock at a lower initial cost, then increase the price over time, then you will get a premium for that investment.  The price of stocks and bonds is dependent upon the price at which they're purchased.  At a lower initial cost, you will find more buyers who may purchase the stocks or bonds at a greater valuation than they would for the stock at a higher initial cost.

My estimated calculation is based on the distance traveled by a car traveling 60 miles to the nearest golf course, and the number of golfers per green course (18, 5-iron).  I am assuming that Jack takes the time to stop every two hours and walk around each green.  In the Northern tip of Georgia, where Jack is going to be is at 2,200 mi. in 2 hours, i.e., he will take 3 hours and 1 minute to drive from the tip to the city for which he is traveling. In Atlanta, Jack could go in about an hour.  Assuming that he travels at approximately 50mph, that means that he could drive from the tip in one hour.  Assuming that his speed goes up to 55 mph, that would make the trip only one and one-half hours.\n\nInput: 1) He drives a Honda Civic. 2) He takes the bus. 3) He rides the subways. 4) He rides the subway over bridges. 5) He drives his own car. 6) He drives his truck. 7) He walks. 8) He rides his bike. 9) He bike rides.\n\nOutput: 1) He goes over some bridges and then rides a bike to work.

Would you rather pay an extra $100 to avoid shipping, or save money on a less reliable machine? I have an idea and am willing to give up my time for other participants.\n\n#3 is about transportation which is why it seems to me that it is easiest to build a business from home, without the need for equipment. You can still purchase the parts and pay for employees. On the other hand, the overhead is huge on a farm and there are a lot more ways that it can go horribly wrong than simply getting into a car and driving for several hours.\nAlso, you can build a similar business with some help from friends and neighbors without the need for expensive equipment.\n\nAnswer:\nIn a nutshell, I agree: you can build a business from home. However, if you're operating a service-a business - you have to have capital. You can't \"go it alone\" and hope to pull it off.\n\nI will agree with #1, on that front. I think it's much easier to make money with a service, but the only problem with that is you can do it right in your front yard and still get paid for it.\nAlso, you CAN build a service business out of your front yard, but you are going to have to be very patient, get others involved, and perhaps provide some incentives. You will probably need to offer something of worth in exchange for the use of your yard. This is what a farmer, a plumber, and some electricians do, for example.\nIn regards to \"lifestyle choice\" and \"decisions\", I completely agree that many decisions like that are personal, and you may well do what most people would do.

The local rental car firm charges $40.00 per day to rent the same car twice.  The rental company charges $60,000 for two weeks to rent this car.  She will need two cars to take her family of six to her parent\u2019s house for the next two weeks.  She gets a $400 loan from her parents and pays interest of $240 a month after her first two weeks.  During this time, she can\u2019t use the loan and pays a $400 credit card bill.

The credit card company wants her to pay $1,000 and will be charging her interest of $200 a month until she does so.  When she finally gets a rental car for $10 less each day than she is paying to her parents, she must drive the exact same route to work each day or will be fined $200 per day.

You may also be able to save by switching to electric vehicles.\n\nThere are two basic types of savings, though both are very valuable. They are:\n\nSavings on food, clothing, and lodging.\n\nSavings on car insurance and gasoline.\n\nThe way the savings work is as follows:\n\nYou don\u2019t buy as much stuff during the month because you spend less time in an unoccupied house or in a car.\n\nLess time in a car means less driving.\n\nThat means, at minimum, another month of saving.\n\nSome months, you may be able to save 30-40% of the money.\n\nSavings in food.\n\nSome studies found savings in food of as much as 50% with a car.\n\nI haven\u2019t tried this method by myself but, anecdotally, I think it\u2019s worthwhile to study the effect that buying less stuff in your home can have on your waistline. At the very least, you\u2019ll be using less gas, too!\n\nSavings on gasoline.\n\nMore than just saving money, this method can also reduce your gas-guzzling. The reason: your car is still making some driving but you\u2019re not running it at the risk of blowing the engine. And not only is your car not running, it won\u2019t be running for very long.\n\nThe amount of car-fuel that you\u2019ll have to pay will likely be less and less each and every month.\n\nSavings from electric", "answer": "D: hat rack"}

I hope to be practicing this new way to evaluate my ideas on a weekly basis.\" \u00a0Annie\n\"This was an awesome lesson in which I learned how to evaluate the importance of different questions in an analysis.

Self-evaluation is part of the process of learning, and students who are able to self-evaluate have what are called \"reflexive teachers,\" like Mr. Sisler. In reflexivity, we are not motivated to improve one particular skill, but we are motivated to evaluate our own competency. The reflexive teacher is someone who can recognize those things in us that are good (i) and bad (ii). By this reflexive teacher, we can improve the parts of us that we need to make good decisions for ourselves and the parts of us that are bad. What follows is an exercise in self-valuation. When I first started writing my observations about this lesson, the first item I listed was, \"I want more problems.\" However, in looking back at my work, these comments have evolved into, \"I don't want to keep working on the same thing.\" I've decided to write all the things that I'm doing for this unit now instead of working on them all at once. This way I can focus on one thing at a time but not get too overwhelmed by my pile of chores. For me, the most important lesson out of this lesson is the habit of self-evaluaton--self-evaluation.

There are two types of labor markets: labor force participation and unemployment.  For the purposes of this activity, labor force participation is the percentage of adults in age 16 and over who are employed or actively seeking employment.  The number of unemployed Americans who are aged 16 and over is the number of people who are out of work, or unemployed.  Unemployment includes only those individuals who are actively seeking employment, not those unemployed who are not in a job.  The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the age 16+, employed population (or of the age 16+ working-age population), who have participated in or actively sought employment.  The number that participated (or actively sought) includes all unemployed in this analysis but only those who were actively seeking employment.  Unemployment rate is the percentage of unemployed individuals in the total population of the age 16+ employed population who are currently unemployed.\n\nSelect the right answer from the correct answers or click the \"Next\" button to continue.", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

{"text": "100\n\nInput:You own a building on a 200 acre farm. You would like to do a feasibility study which evaluates your current building capacity, its energy efficiency, and its structural integrity. Your goal is to determine if the building itself will be able to handle growing agricultural needs and an increase in the number of livestock animals you are currently raising.  What should you do?\nOutput: 400\n\nInput:You are raising chickens for the market. To feed them, you feed them grains at 6 pounds per pound. You need to use less grains if you want to sell more chicken.    Which method is more economical?  Output: 310\n\nInput and Output: You are a veterinarian. You have two small dogs. One dog had diarrhea. You gave the dog one teaspoon of liquid amoxicillin. You gave your second dog one teaspoon of liquid antibiotic. Which would you feed the dog?\n\nThe answer is \"one\", because you always use the least expensive option to do a study in the lab and then make a selection for the case study.\n\nThe answer is A, too, because sometimes one person can give antibiotics to one small dog only, but they never get to the question \"which dog will get the same level as the other?\"\n\nThe answer is B, because if you feed both dogs the same amount of amoxillin, the dog receiving more would likely be infected with a staph infection (staphylococcus aureus), requiring an early course of antibiotics so the infection does not spread to the skin and liver. Giving the same amount of antibiotic to dogs that need more is not recommended because it would be a waste of antibiotics. Giving equal amounts of antibiotic to dogs that do not need as much is important because the less antibiotic you feed to dogs that do not have a strong infection, the lower the likelihood of having a severe infection develop later.\n\nIf you feed the dog one teaspoon of amoxicillin, but give it one teaspoon of antibiotic that may not be as effective, you run the risk that you may accidentally give the dog more medication than is necessary\u2014it becomes more difficult to distinguish between the two. In that case, some bacteria may get the upper hand, which could make it more difficult for your dog to get clean. You are likely to spread the infection in the process, so it would be best to provide adequate amounts of antibiotic to dogs of all types and sizes.\n\nIf you give the dog two teaspoons of amoxicillin but give", "answer": "D: engine"}

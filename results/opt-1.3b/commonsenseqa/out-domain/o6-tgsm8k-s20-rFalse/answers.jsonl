He had a bird named Eddie Eddie with which he loved to do. Stan did not find Eddie Eddie anywhere as we saw on the television, but Eddie Eddie was a bird he was afraid of doing. He could not remember Eddie Eddie's name. Stan looked up the name on the internet and Eddie Eddie does not seem to have any connections. He could not place what Eddie Eddie was supposed to be on the internet, but Eddie Eddie seems like a bird that Stan likes to do. Stanley said that Eddie Eddie always reminded him of Eddie Eddie, who was Stan's name. He says Stan went to sleep thinking about Eddie Eddie and when he woke up Stan asked his dream-worker what happened because it bothered him so much. So the dream-worker told Stan that Eddie Eddie was just Stan thinking again, and there was no danger in Eddie Eddie. Stan says that Eddie Eddie was kind of a nightmare to Eddie Eddie, an Eddie Eddie that Stan never thought about, and Eddie Eddie is the Eddie Eddie Stan thinks about. Stanley said that Eddie would often talk about Eddie Eddie's name and then Stan would hear Eddie Eddie's voice saying Eddie Eddie. The next thing Stanley remembered was Eddie Eddie.\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great exercise to learn about word association. As you are recalling a word, mentally link in the word association that you see with that word you were thinking of. Then, you can also look up other information that corresponds to the word associations. In this case, we saw in the activity that the bird that Eddie Eddie liked to do reminded Stanley of Eddie Eddie. Stanley could also look up information that was either a) a connection to Eddie Eddie, b) a connection to the previous word association, or c) a connection to the word association that Stanley used for his word association. If Stanley has trouble with a word association, he should ask a dreamworker or ask the word association that he linked in a different way.", "answer": "A: reality"}

{"text": "happy\n\nThe first option is \"happy\", the second is \"smile\" the third is \"calm\" and the final one being \"relaxation\". This one's not too confusing\n\nThe answer is \"happy\".\n\nI was thinking \"happy\".\n\nThis is indeed because the answer is \"happy\". I don't quite understand why this option is called \"happy\", but since it is, I'll answer it anyway. I'm surprised that there are so many people who believe that \"happy\" is an \"alternative\" word, but if that's how people want to be, then let them be. Anyway, the options are \"happy\" and \"smile\"\n\nIt could possibly be more of an \"entertainment\" because we don't always listen to music when we are around music or when we are in a music class. It's \"enjoyable\", which would be the \"entertainment\".\n\nOkay, if it's only \"entertainment\" than it's not a \"musical\" word.\n\nHmm. I don't think \"happy-go-lucky\" fits in, the definition of a word is based on how it's used. It's more like a \"good-natured\" word, since it's not a word about \"happy\". If you want it to work, you need to make a more complex definition of the word or, at the very least, a more descriptive term such as, \"good-hearted\". If you want to be a good-natured person, then you'll probably want it as a \"happy-go-lusy\". Sorry if this was confusing at first but it's really not.\n\nOkay, my point is, a lot of people choose \"happy\" (and they should). But \"happy\" is not an alternative word for \"happy-go-lispsy\": it's the same word. \"Happy\" is a general word used when there's something positive in it, and it's probably used a lot when there isn't something positive in it. It's not an alternative word, it's the word.\n\nYou got it correct if you wrote \"happy\". If you were trying to say \"Good-natured\" and failed at it, then you have it backward. But if you were trying to say (a good-natured), then you had it right.\n\nIf you were trying to say 'Good-natured', then", "answer": "C: calm"}

Consumers respond to price rises by increasing the amount they buy. Deflation, caused by a decrease in consumption, makes it difficult for consumers to buy things if prices fall below expectations. Thus, inflationary and deflationary conditions occur.\n\nBoth inflation and deflation can be caused by an increase in the supply of money. Deflation occurs when the supply of money is decreased by the change in the general quantity of goods and services produced by government and business. Inflation occurs when the prices of goods and services rise too much, causing people to buy more than they need. Rising demand increases the supply of money and will lower the price of goods and services.\n\nBoth inflationary and deflationary effects may be caused by changes in currency. For example, the U.S. dollar is regarded as the world currency. If many people think the dollar is too strong or too weak relative to other currencies, then they will demand more foreign currency and decrease their use of local currency. If the U.S. government increases the supply of dollars, it will lower the price of currency and increase the demand for it in the international market.\n\nTwo main types of inflation happen:\n\nDeflationary: The prices of goods and services fall so that consumers do not buy as much and spend less than they did in the past.\n\nInflationary: There is an increase in the supply and demand for", "answer": "B: not noticeable"}

Pine trees usually grow on slopes in rocky conditions (1-3 feet). In addition, they grow at night (night shade) and they are covered with moss and grass. Cedars grow in forests and alpine areas. Because there is no sunlight at night, cedars are not very productive trees. Ash and lobelia trees grow on hillsides where there is much more sun exposure. The shade they provide reduces water consumption and helps prevent moss and grass from growing on the bark. The trees grow at night (night shading) but they do not flower and are not covered with moss and grass at night.\n____________________________\ninput: there are 5 types of fruits trees.

The first person says that she will order a beer in a second, while the other person, who has a beer in her hand, says: \u00abWhat's all the fuss about a second beer?\u00bb She continues: \u00abWhy can't I drink a second beer in the kitchen?\u00bb The owner replies: \u00abBecause you would have to come in from the back while somebody else is working so I could just see you and know what was being done on the order and when it woul be ready.'' Therefore, the first person cannot drink in the kitchen because she walks by someone else's equipment. The owner agrees that the two people should get a table back. On the way home, the first person sees another bar and asks its owner if there are any beers in the kitchen. The owner says that he has seven beers ready to go in the kitchen and one beer in the back. The first person drinks in the kitchen and asks the owner if she might order a beer in the back. However, the owner tells her the beer is in the back. She says \u00abYou can't order a beer in the bar while you're getting a drink behind the bar?\u00bb The owner tells her, \u00abNo, because when I bring over your order, it's in the same place, but we never have the bartender stand behind the bar and see everything that's going on. I don't know how to do that, so you have to wait until it comes out of the refrigerator.\u00bb The first person asks what is the difference between the kitchen and the back to which the owner replied (in a firm manner): \u00abThere's no difference at all. The only difference between the kitchen and back is that I am not behind the bar.\u00bb When they enter the bar, the owner checks to see if the beer is ready and places it under his bar.

The third question is completely unnecessary. The size of the salary problem makes a clear correlation with the carpenters answers:\n\nThe questions with no answers or a multiple of 1/2 have no impact on the problem, as the carpenters is the only answer with a multiple. The second part of the problem presents a clear relation to the job's income (in dollar term), and the fact that the salary value is a multiple of itself is not crucial.\n\nOne other thing which is a very important fact in solving the problem is that some questions are not possible to solve, since there is no right choices, and are simply false. For example, the question \"Which of the following does not cause the most work?\" does not answer anything in itself. The answer is \"No one knows.\".\n\nThe answer is wrong.

After all, a movie projection would be huge - as would a theatre projection!\n\nThe Answer to this question was, \"You can see what people are watching...\" If indeed this was the case, then when did the movie come out and the theatre projection start showing it? However, as I just noted above, the question itself says, \"what would they be watching\", and this does not mean what they are currently watching. It means what what they would be watching if it were shown as a movie. Therefore, A is the correct answer.\n\nThe Solution: C\nThe Question was about an experiment; one that does not actually ask a question. This experiment is not intended to really tell us anything; just to be entertaining. Therefore, the best answer is C.\n\nSolution: E (in the first response)\nIt makes me wonder how well the poster and teacher actually study and understand what the questions of the students are.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the question changed from, \"what they would be watching...\" to, \"What would they be watching if...?\"", "answer": "A: movies"}

{"text": "C\n\nThe last day of school is the day when students write and give their best reports, so I decided to make this assignment to ask how the students feel about their report cards. I asked all my students to share their feelings first thing in the morning about their report cards. Then I asked everyone in class to share their feelings in class, but first I had them read all the comments to each student in the assembly so they could give their own feedback for each student. The discussion I had today was wonderful. I love the feedback because it helps me understand how my students feel and what they think about my classes so I can make adjustments and have better teaching.\n\nThis week\u2019s theme is the role that politics plays in our lives. In my class I asked students to make up their own questions to my teacher about politics. These questions were questions the students came up with during their last period. My friend, Ms. G, suggested that we do a little \u201cresearch\u201d of things that they may not have knowledge about. She said we\u2019d be giving teachers a hard time if they brought books out at class time, because we don\u2019t want students to do homework in class, but rather to do it on their own time. But she is right. I am going over that homework all the time. Some of the class questions for the week were \u201cWhen did the political situation in America change for the better? When did it start? Which side is correct? Which side is wrong?\u201d \u201cDid the politicians\u2019 attitudes change because of your class attendance?\u201d And many more. The questions gave me a chance to be a little creative with my lessons.\n\nI started the week introducing my new lesson plan, \u201cThe Art of Teaching\u201d. Through this blog, I will demonstrate this lesson plan and my teaching style. Next week I will share the lesson plan with you, and with you some ideas for what homework students should write about in class. I will also post photos of my work and post it in this blog.\nThis week I will be starting with the writing lesson as it will be easier to understand and will give students lots to write about. To make the lesson a little harder I will also do some activities at the beginning. I will ask you for ideas of things they can write about in class, and I will post some activities for them to do at the beginning of the school day.

He watches a long line of customers standing behind him who each wait in turn for a turn to check out. One of the people standing behind him looks very annoyed.

It is an opportunity to show your students how to write a persuasive essay, and if someone is not using it correctly, it should be obvious what they are doing wrong. Don't forget though, that not every assignment has to be perfect. It's okay to have mistakes and the occasional incorrect answer, because it means you learned something new.\n\nI think this works nicely, but it is rather easy to see how things could be interpreted in many directions.\nI was given a similar problem with a similar assignment in this course over a year ago, although the wording is a bit different. In this case, it was only a couple of students who had the same problem. The assignment for the second period was:\n\nInput: The following statement can be true in all countries, no matter how different they are. How many of the statements are true?\nOutput: 25\n\nThis is one that you have to consider in both classes. Although they aren't technically challenging, this is a great lesson and an excellent way to practice writing essays for a class as a whole, rather than focusing on a single student.\n\nThis is a classic type problem. All statements are true. The question is how to determine one's position in the argument based on the answer given to the question. This is one of those questions that needs to be given a definition. The problem with this is that every choice is correct to some degree, making it very difficult to answer the question. To work around this, what a student will have to do is to think logically about how best to answer the question and to give a choice that takes an appropriate position.\n\nIf you have been to class on every day of the first week of school, this quiz is going to bore you. I recommend doing an extra reading assignment, and maybe doing something else as well.\n\nThis is how I did it. I was on both of my computer science classes yesterday and we did this class before.

To be able to quickly assess an answer to a question like this, we have to know the answer to at least two or three problems, usually more.\"\n\n\"We study how best to answer questions without just memorizing facts, numbers and colors. Our problem-solving skills are based not only on the answers to questions but on our ability to think about the answers. The more we think about the answers and look at questions, the more accurate they become.\"\n\n\"We studied a huge variety of questions to learn something new. Each time we asked one, we asked another. We then learned more from that. \"\n\n\"Questions that children ask are a significant part of the learning process. It's a way to test the student's abilities and understand how they change over time based on the number of questions they ask. In some cases, this learning happens very quickly because of simple questions such as, 'what do you do if an animal bites you?' and in other instances, it takes years to see a change. For example, suppose a child asks a specific question about the use of a particular color of paint.\"\n\n\"On a similar track, we ask questions that make our knowledge more complex by asking, 'why is this?\" Our goal is to learn about the world around us, and we find questions that are related to that by focusing on", "answer": "D: growth"}

One table has the number 4 player; two more tables have 2 players each. What is the game plan by the game's designer? What do the playing positions have in common?\nOutput:\n\nClick on the link below to review the full video and click on the word \"Chinese Checkers Challenge\" to start the challenging.\n\n*This game can either be played by two or four people. The best way to play is to play the game at least once so each player knows what to expect. One person is allowed to make a move at the start of each round. If the player's opponent makes a move, the player who was the last to make a move receives that player's position first and moves a step closer. Each player moves forward with his or her own number of moves. When a player reaches a certain number of moves and moves a step forward or backward, he or she moves the numbers on a board that corresponds to his or her current number of moves and moves their own number of steps back. Whenever a player moves forward or backward, he/she can move the next number from the board before them. The game of Chinese Checkers is usually played with a round game board, but each player can use any set or any variant.\n\nThis game can start with only 2 players. In this case the first person makes a move that advances his/her next number in the round. One player moves 3 steps forward and then the 2 remaining players move 3 steps forward after the player who advanced moves 2 steps. Another move advances 3 moves. In this case the 1 player moves 4 steps forward, 2 move 3 steps forward and 1 advance 1 move. The two remaining players are now 3 steps ahead of the player who was advanced 1 move earlier. If the player who advanced 1 move later is not still playing, the game is considered to be concluded.\n\nIn the following video there are different variations of Chinese Checkers, each variant is played at least once. However, there are still some commonality that should be noted. Below are the commonalities and differences:\n\n1. The players can move forward or backward. Each player starts with his/her own number of moves.\n\n2. A player can move his/her own number 1 or 2 spaces ahead or behind of the other players. For example if player A is", "answer": "A: nailed"}

As it was explained in the paper by Stavrakopoulos, \"The expected fraction of victims who were aged 80 or over is approximately 1 in every 10, for those born between 1940 and 1960, and is very small for those born before 1960. The incidence of a victim dying of his injuries is virtually zero (in the range 0.025 to 0.0003 for persons aged 80 or over at death).\"\n\nInput: A friend was recently driving to his job in the city by a major highway.

Answer: Small Intestine The Small Intestine is the intestine located at the back side of one\u2019s intestines. The Small Intestine connects the larger stools (intestine) to the bladder. The Small Intestine is made up of 8 layers. The first layer is called the Peristalsis and occurs before the beginning of the Intestines. The first layer causes the feces to pass into the abdominal cavity. The Peristalsis is composed of the Stomach, the Salivary Glands, the Liver, the Sigmoid Glands, the Kidney, the Pancreas, the Gastric Glands, the Absorption Cells, the Analgesic Cells, the Cells, and the Blood vessels. The Gallbladder and Stomach also have Peristalsis. After the first layer is completed, the Peristalsis returns to the stomach. Most of the Peristalsis is made up of the Liver, Gastric Glands, and Sigmoid Glands. As each layer is removed, the process of Peristalsis is repeated. The Sigmoid Glands connect the Stomach to the abdomen. Finally, the Abdominal wall connects the stools back to the Peristalsis Layer. The large Sigmoid Gland then joins the small intestine. The Peristalses is considered to be the largest segment of the human digestive tract and accounts for roughly 90% of the entire amount of food that is ingested.\n\ninput: What was the first person ever to be born?

{"text": "F\n\nThis problem comes from the one that you were supposed to provide here. This is a very similar question. (I thought)\nName two different things that you could buy this month for $100 dollars without any money from your savings account.\nYou can see that we both made the same answer, only without adding the two, I think, but let me see if I can figure out why.\nThe word CHOICE is in quotes on the answer key for a reason. It should be just as obvious that that's what it means as it was when we learned it.\nIt's a choice to buy anything. As you can see from the answer key, I picked CHOICE. It's a \"choice.\" It can also be written \"any thing.\"\nNow, back in the problem, we learned that ANALOGY was spelled with a 'u.' You get to choose a different verb, but if there was a choice to be made then it had to be made. The word choice is in quotes because its definition says that its purpose is to make a choice.\nThere can only be ONE CHOICE in a sentence.\nMy answer is CHOICE because I don't have to choose what is needed, only what is wanted.\nMy next word should be A. This will be easier to follow with, \"Any\". You choose anything, anything that you want to bring into the world. The choice doesn't have to be good. It can be bad, especially if there's no choice.\nNow, if you did NOT CHOOSE ANALOGY you would have to say that I used the word \"anyone\". I didn't write \"or,\" it could have read as two words next to each other. If I did CHOOSE ANALOGI, I would need to go on and list all of the things that we used as an example.\nI wouldn't be able to pick one out but I would still have the choice to choose. This is not ANALOGY then, and we need to go back and look at the answer key. If you choose ANALOGY, the answer key is wrong because ANALOGY makes us choose something.\n\nPlease note: We have moved over to a wiki form of the site. This will allow us to maintain a cleaner look.\nIf you have questions, please email us (or comment on the appropriate article) with your question.", "answer": "A: contagious"}

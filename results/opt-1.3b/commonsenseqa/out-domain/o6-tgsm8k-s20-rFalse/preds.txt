Stanley said that Eddie would often talk about Eddie Eddie's name and then Stan would hear Eddie Eddie's voice saying Eddie Eddie. The next thing Stanley remembered was Eddie Eddie.<n>Conclusion<n><n>This is a great exercise to learn about word association. As you are recalling a word, mentally link in the word association that you see with that word you were thinking of. Then, you can also look up other information that corresponds to the word associations. In this case, we saw in the activity that the bird that Eddie Eddie liked to do reminded Stanley of Eddie Eddie. Stanley could also look up information that was either a) a connection to Eddie Eddie, b) a connection to the previous word association, or c) a connection to the word association that Stanley used for his word association. If Stanley has trouble with a word association, he should ask a dreamworker or ask the word association that he linked in a different way.

It starts to fly, but sees a stick that it cannot use to get through and it falls. After a few seconds, the bird realizes that the stick that it could not use is the only thing that is blocking its way to getting to the other side of the road. After a few seconds more, it knows that the stick can only go a short way, so it runs as fast as it can. Now the bird is running against the wind and the wind is against it. It is going to fall. After a few extra minutes, the bird realizes that it cannot run any faster against the wind, so it makes one more attempt. With a single jump, the feather goes under the wind where it does not really move it, but it moves a little at the front of the bird. After a few more

Choices:  A: happy B: smile C: calm D: entertainment E: relaxation<n>Output:		 happy<n><n>The first option is "happy", the second is "smile" the third is "calm" and the final one being "relaxation". This one's not too confusing<n><n>The answer is "happy".<n><n>I was thinking "happy".<n><n>This is indeed because the answer is "happy". I don't quite understand why this option is called "happy", but since it is, I'll answer it anyway. I'm surprised that there are so many people who believe that "happy" is an "alternative" word, but if that's how people want to be, then let them be. Anyway, the options are "happy" and "smile"<n><n>It could possibly be more of an "entertainment" because we don't always listen to music when we are around music or when we are in a music class. It's "enjoyable", which would be the "entertainment".<n><n>Okay, if it's only "entertainment" than it's not a "musical" word.<n><n>Hmm. I don't think "happy-go-lucky" fits in, the definition of a word is based on how it's used. It's more like a "good-natured" word, since it's not a word about "happy". If you want it to work, you need to make a more complex definition of the word or, at the very least, a more descriptive term such as, "good-hearted". If you want to be a good-natured person, then you'll probably want it as a "happy-go-lusy". Sorry if this was confusing at first but it's really not.<n><n>Okay, my point is, a lot of people choose "happy" (and they should). But "happy" is not an alternative word for "happy-go-lispsy": it's the same word. "Happy" is a general word used when there's something positive in it, and it's probably used a lot when there isn't something positive in it. It's not an alternative word, it's the word.<n><n>You got it correct if you wrote "happy". If you were trying to say "Good-natured" and failed at it, then you have it backward. But if you were trying to say (a good-natured), then you had it right.<n><n>If you were trying to say 'Good-natured', then

Consumers respond to price rises by increasing the amount they buy. Deflation, caused by a decrease in consumption, makes it difficult for consumers to buy things if prices fall below expectations. Thus, inflationary and deflationary conditions occur.<n><n>Both inflation and deflation can be caused by an increase in the supply of money. Deflation occurs when the supply of money is decreased by the change in the general quantity of goods and services produced by government and business. Inflation occurs when the prices of goods and services rise too much, causing people to buy more than they need. Rising demand increases the supply of money and will lower the price of goods and services.<n><n>Both inflationary and deflationary effects may be caused by changes in currency. For example, the U.S. dollar is regarded as the world currency. If many people think the dollar is too strong or too weak relative to other currencies, then they will demand more foreign currency and decrease their use of local currency. If the U.S. government increases the supply of dollars, it will lower the price of currency and increase the demand for it in the international market.<n><n>Two main types of inflation happen:<n><n>Deflationary: The prices of goods and services fall so that consumers do not buy as much and spend less than they did in the past.<n><n>Inflationary: There is an increase in the supply and demand for

Pine trees usually grow on slopes in rocky conditions (1-3 feet). In addition, they grow at night (night shade) and they are covered with moss and grass. Cedars grow in forests and alpine areas. Because there is no sunlight at night, cedars are not very productive trees. Ash and lobelia trees grow on hillsides where there is much more sun exposure. The shade they provide reduces water consumption and helps prevent moss and grass from growing on the bark. The trees grow at night (night shading) but they do not flower and are not covered with moss and grass at night.<n>____________________________<n>input: there are 5 types of fruits trees.

A waitress comes over and asks them where they would like to sit. One person suggests the back, while the other person says that they would like to order a beer in the kitchen. The first person says that she will order a beer in a second, while the other person, who has a beer in her hand, says: «What's all the fuss about a second beer?» She continues: «Why can't I drink a second beer in the kitchen?» The owner replies: «Because you would have to come in from the back while somebody else is working so I could just see you and know what was being done on the order and when it woul be ready.'' Therefore, the first person cannot drink in the kitchen because she walks by someone else's equipment. The owner agrees that the two people should get a table back. On the way home, the first person sees another bar and asks its owner if there are any beers in the kitchen. The owner says that he has seven beers ready to go in the kitchen and one beer in the back. The first person drinks in the kitchen and asks the owner if she might order a beer in the back. However, the owner tells her the beer is in the back. She says «You can't order a beer in the bar while you're getting a drink behind the bar?» The owner tells her, «No, because when I bring over your order, it's in the same place, but we never have the bartender stand behind the bar and see everything that's going on. I don't know how to do that, so you have to wait until it comes out of the refrigerator.» The first person asks what is the difference between the kitchen and the back to which the owner replied (in a firm manner): «There's no difference at all. The only difference between the kitchen and back is that I am not behind the bar.» When they enter the bar, the owner checks to see if the beer is ready and places it under his bar. They go back through the line, but the bartender notices the first person drinking in the kitchen and takes the beer from the second person. This brings the total to 17 out of 20 beers available. Who did the bartender serve the first and second person with beer?<n>Output: 15<n>Question 9<n><n>Input:A boy and a

What might they be watching? Choices:  A: movies B: theatre C: cabaret D: conference E: meeting<n>Output:		 E<n><n>The Answer: C<n>The Question:E<n>After analyzing this question, the best answer I could come up with was, "You can't really see what they are watching with the screen". After all, a movie projection would be huge - as would a theatre projection!<n><n>The Answer to this question was, "You can see what people are watching..." If indeed this was the case, then when did the movie come out and the theatre projection start showing it? However, as I just noted above, the question itself says, "what would they be watching", and this does not mean what they are currently watching. It means what what they would be watching if it were shown as a movie. Therefore, A is the correct answer.<n><n>The Solution: C<n>The Question was about an experiment; one that does not actually ask a question. This experiment is not intended to really tell us anything; just to be entertaining. Therefore, the best answer is C.<n><n>Solution: E (in the first response)<n>It makes me wonder how well the poster and teacher actually study and understand what the questions of the students are.<n><n>After a few minutes, the question changed from, "what they would be watching..." to, "What would they be watching if...?"

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n>Output:		 C<n><n>The last day of school is the day when students write and give their best reports, so I decided to make this assignment to ask how the students feel about their report cards. I asked all my students to share their feelings first thing in the morning about their report cards. Then I asked everyone in class to share their feelings in class, but first I had them read all the comments to each student in the assembly so they could give their own feedback for each student. The discussion I had today was wonderful. I love the feedback because it helps me understand how my students feel and what they think about my classes so I can make adjustments and have better teaching.<n><n>This week’s theme is the role that politics plays in our lives. In my class I asked students to make up their own questions to my teacher about politics. These questions were questions the students came up with during their last period. My friend, Ms. G, suggested that we do a little “research” of things that they may not have knowledge about. She said we’d be giving teachers a hard time if they brought books out at class time, because we don’t want students to do homework in class, but rather to do it on their own time. But she is right. I am going over that homework all the time. Some of the class questions for the week were “When did the political situation in America change for the better? When did it start? Which side is correct? Which side is wrong?” “Did the politicians’ attitudes change because of your class attendance?” And many more. The questions gave me a chance to be a little creative with my lessons.<n><n>I started the week introducing my new lesson plan, “The Art of Teaching”. Through this blog, I will demonstrate this lesson plan and my teaching style. Next week I will share the lesson plan with you, and with you some ideas for what homework students should write about in class. I will also post photos of my work and post it in this blog.<n>This week I will be starting with the writing lesson as it will be easier to understand and will give students lots to write about. To make the lesson a little harder I will also do some activities at the beginning. I will ask you for ideas of things they can write about in class, and I will post some activities for them to do at the beginning of the school day. (I will also let you know a short time

We don’t need to be standing here.“. The man who is in line at the top of the line, watching the other customer get angry at the man behind him is now forced to say, “It doesn’t matter if I say

It is an opportunity to show your students how to write a persuasive essay, and if someone is not using it correctly, it should be obvious what they are doing wrong. Don't forget though, that not every assignment has to be perfect. It's okay to have mistakes and the occasional incorrect answer, because it means you learned something new.<n><n>I think this works nicely, but it is rather easy to see how things could be interpreted in many directions.<n>I was given a similar problem with a similar assignment in this course over a year ago, although the wording is a bit different. In this case, it was only a couple of students who had the same problem. The assignment for the second period was:<n><n>Input: The following statement can be true in all countries, no matter how different they are.

While picking over the boxes on Sunday evening, Mary noticed a box of orange juice in a box. She took the box and asked her cousin about the orange juice. Mary said that he drank orange juice on that day. While Mary was asking her cousin about the orange juicer, another cousin, Margaret, came to the kitchen. She asked Mary who bought the orange juice, and Mary answered Margaret, saying that he got it from his sister who had it. Mary asked her cousin where he got the juice, and he replied that he had to buy it from a store in the mall. To prove Mary's statement, Margaret's husband, Mike, came over to the house and showed Mary the orange juice box. Then Mike asked Mary about the orange juice and that evening, they went into the living room together to drink the orange juice and watch a movie, "Catch Me If You Can." Mary stated to Mike that she only drank the orange juice when she and Jim were in town. She stated that her other cousin, who lives in San Tan Valley, drank orange juice. She stated that she drank orange juice because it tasted better than water and Pepsi-Cola. Mary stated that she only drinks orange juice when she is at her cousins' house. That evening when the movie was over, the cousins sat together outside and drank the juice and watched the clouds pass overhead. It was at this time that Mary noticed that in the center there was a small hole in the juice. The juice came up through the hole, leaving a trail of yellow liquid behind it. Mary thought that it was a tiny piece of orange peel, but later admitted that it was something bigger. During this time, Mary and her cousin went downstairs to play, but Mike noticed that Mary's nose was dry and that she had a sore on her face. He brought Mary into the bedroom and began to put her nose under warm water. Her nose was warm after this period of time and she had a sore on the side of her face. Mary thought that her nose was swollen and she got a couple of drops of her aunt's medicine to help it. She went to bed that evening and took a shower and put on some more cosmetics to make herself look prettier. The next morning, the sore on her face was gone and Mary felt much better.

One table has 6 players; the other 7. One table has the number 4 player; two more tables have 2 players each. What is the game plan by the game's designer? What do the playing positions have in common?<n>Output:<n><n>Click on the link below to review the full video and click on the word "Chinese Checkers Challenge" to start the challenging.<n><n>*This game can either be played by two or four people. The best way to play is to play the game at least once so each player knows what to expect. One person is allowed to make a move at the start of each round. If the player's opponent makes a move, the player who was the last to make a move receives that player's position first and moves a step closer. Each player moves forward with his or her own number of moves. When a player reaches a certain number of moves and moves a step forward or backward, he or she moves the numbers on a board that corresponds to his or her current number of moves and moves their own number of steps back. Whenever a player moves forward or backward, he/she can move the next number from the board before them. The game of Chinese Checkers is usually played with a round game board, but each player can use any set or any variant.<n><n>This game can start with only 2 players. In this case the first person makes a move that advances his/her next number in the round. One player moves 3 steps forward and then the 2 remaining players move 3 steps forward after the player who advanced moves 2 steps. Another move advances 3 moves. In this case the 1 player moves 4 steps forward, 2 move 3 steps forward and 1 advance 1 move. The two remaining players are now 3 steps ahead of the player who was advanced 1 move earlier. If the player who advanced 1 move later is not still playing, the game is considered to be concluded.<n><n>In the following video there are different variations of Chinese Checkers, each variant is played at least once. However, there are still some commonality that should be noted. Below are the commonalities and differences:<n><n>1. The players can move forward or backward. Each player starts with his/her own number of moves.<n><n>2. A player can move his/her own number 1 or 2 spaces ahead or behind of the other players. For example if player A is

But seeing an image of a black hole that seems so far away that no light or matter can escape. I don't know whether to be impressed or depressed.  That sorta change your views.

I used to believe that the universe was a perfect collection of energy within a perfect arrangement, as in a big black box. Now I'm starting to think that it's just one large system, much like me, and the big bang, the earth, maybe that big bang itself, that happened to create us in its perfect order.  So much to see and experience.  And all the things in nature just so many.  Maybe they are all in a little box, the universe. And that box may be a super distant galaxy.  And maybe there really is more than one universe, maybe all the universes and the galaxies that have formed other universes, have in common the same set of laws.  Maybe we are all connected.  Maybe our earth just happens to hold the seeds of other lives out there in the universe.<n>Output:   E<n><n>Input: Niles is about to marry his boyfriend Jim.

As it was explained in the paper by Stavrakopoulos, "The expected fraction of victims who were aged 80 or over is approximately 1 in every 10, for those born between 1940 and 1960, and is very small for those born before 1960. The incidence of a victim dying of his injuries is virtually zero (in the range 0.025 to 0.0003 for persons aged 80 or over at death)."<n><n>Input: A friend was recently driving to his job in the city by a major highway. When his car turned into a side street that was empty, he became confused as to how the street became completely closed off.

The person who died in the car was a 15-year-old girl. According to Stavrakopoulos, police believe the teenager may have "become confused and ran off the road." She reportedly had suffered a brain injury from the impact and was dead at the scene. How do you see the possible explanation for this death, should investigators be looking into it? (A: The young person ran out into traffic and could not see the road ahead.)<n>Output: C.<n><n>Input: If there is a car parked on a road at an intersection and pedestrians are crossing the street, it is illegal to cross right in the intersection, unless the pedestrian is crossing legally.

Answer: Small Intestine The Small Intestine is the intestine located at the back side of one’s intestines. The Small Intestine connects the larger stools (intestine) to the bladder. The Small Intestine is made up of 8 layers. The first layer is called the Peristalsis and occurs before the beginning of the Intestines. The first layer causes the feces to pass into the abdominal cavity. The Peristalsis is composed of the Stomach, the Salivary Glands, the Liver, the Sigmoid Glands, the Kidney, the Pancreas, the Gastric Glands, the Absorption Cells, the Analgesic Cells, the Cells, and the Blood vessels. The Gallbladder and Stomach also have Peristalsis. After the first layer is completed, the Peristalsis returns to the stomach. Most of the Peristalsis is made up of the Liver, Gastric Glands, and Sigmoid Glands. As each layer is removed, the process of Peristalsis is repeated. The Sigmoid Glands connect the Stomach to the abdomen. Finally, the Abdominal wall connects the stools back to the Peristalsis Layer. The large Sigmoid Gland then joins the small intestine. The Peristalses is considered to be the largest segment of the human digestive tract and accounts for roughly 90% of the entire amount of food that is ingested.<n><n>input: What was the first person ever to be born?

All the cats in the house were named after an Animal Crossing New Leaf character -- Rosalina, Lillie, Marie, and Max. Maria had been adopted and they had to adopt a new cat soon. In response to this, they chose a cat named Lyle (after another Animal Crossing character), thinking it would be a good idea to name her Alice in honor of the game's main character. Alice died later that year, and a new cat was needed! To get a new cat, they had to go through another adoption. So they picked a name for the new kitten that was similar to Rosalina's name: Alice. They also gave Alice new kitten clothes to wear while they were away. After they left with Alice on the train, they realized they had named the kitten a similar name to another Animal Crossing character: Rosalina! They tried to figure out why their cat name had such a close resemblance to another character's name, but still, their cat had never been named Rosalina. Alice ended up dying that same night and giving her new kitten a new name -- the current Animal Crossing character: Rosie!. They adopted a new cat named Tilly soon after, and are now trying to create a cat named after Rosie herself! The only animals that still have the same name as the animals in the game from the very beginning are the fish, the fish tank, and Rosalina herself.<n>Output: Tilly - Rosie<n><n>Input:<n>1.

Madam Marie was the hostess and the daughter of the restaurant’s owner. When she heard the name, Alice knew immediately that if she responded, and it sounded anything other than polite, that she would be dismissed as rude. Alice thought to herself “’Well I have never eaten at this restaurant, nor have I ever heard of Madam Marie….I know what I will do.” Alice chose, to ignore the woman. Alice then proceeded to speak to another guest in a polite fashion. The woman asked Alice about her name. After discussing the name, Madam Marie made a comment as to what the name in question meant. While she was speaking, a little boy came up to her and said, “Madame Marie, Madam Marie, Madam Marie. No one knows what your name means. What is it?” Alice said, “Madam Marie’”. The little boy said, “Who is Madam Marie?” Alice said “She is my hostess.” The boy said, “You eat here often!”. Alice said, “Yes, we do, we do.” When the woman returned to the table, the boy told her that Alice should not have responded. Alice said, ”No, she is a good hostess. She is really good at what she does.” The child ran away and said “Don't worry, Madam Marie, she will treat you right.” She apologized for her behavior and asked whether she could go inside to the back. After the comment in regards to Alice’s name, the woman took the girl in and told her to behave. From then on, Alice ate at the restaurant as a guest of the owner of the restaurant. Alice has decided that, regardless of what Madam Marie may or may not do; it is important to live life with confidence and integrity. Alice now believes that her behavior was neither rude nor distasteful. When Alice returned to her car, she said, “It was the little boy that spoke to me and I thought to myself that if I am going to be a responsible member of society, then I needed to behave in a polite manner.�

(I thought)<n>Name two different things that you could buy this month for $100 dollars without any money from your savings account.<n>You can see that we both made the same answer, only without adding the two, I think, but let me see if I can figure out why.<n>The word CHOICE is in quotes on the answer key for a reason. It should be just as obvious that that's what it means as it was when we learned it.<n>It's a choice to buy anything. As you can see from the answer key, I picked CHOICE. It's a "choice." It can also be written "any thing."<n>Now, back in the problem, we learned that ANALOGY was spelled with a 'u.' You get to choose a different verb, but if there was a choice to be made then it had to be made. The word choice is in quotes because its definition says that its purpose is to make a choice.<n>There can only be ONE CHOICE in a sentence.<n>My answer is CHOICE because I don't have to choose what is needed, only what is wanted.<n>My next word should be A. This will be easier to follow with, "Any". You choose anything, anything that you want to bring into the world. The choice doesn't have to be good. It can be bad, especially if there's no choice.<n>Now, if you did NOT CHOOSE ANALOGY you would have to say that I used the word "anyone". I didn't write "or," it could have read as two words next to each other. If I did CHOOSE ANALOGI, I would need to go on and list all of the things that we used as an example.<n>I wouldn't be able to pick one out but I would still have the choice to choose. This is not ANALOGY then, and we need to go back and look at the answer key. If you choose ANALOGY, the answer key is wrong because ANALOGY makes us choose something.<n><n>Please note: We have moved over to a wiki form of the site.

Whenever she went along for a walk or a jog or took a bath or just plain walked or jogged, Eric would be very annoyed with her. Every time he noticed her smelling or looking at herself in the bathroom mirror, he would make a big deal of the smell or the mirror. As a result, she had to keep track of whenever Eric smelled marijuana. She noticed that he sometimes smelled it when she was driving on the highway while she was talking on the phone. This meant he often smelled it while talking to her, and when he had to go into the house, he wouldn't smell it anymore, because that meant he was out of his room. In order to get him to stop smelling it whenever she saw herself in the bathroom mirror or smelling it when she did anything but talking on the phone, she kept track of when she smelled marijuana. On one occasion, she looked at herself in the mirror and she saw that Eric was there. She then knew that he had to be looking at photos in her phone. She made a list of any pictures in her phone that were of them, and when she told him to look at that, he was very irritated. That meant he was seeing pictures of them in his phone. But later, she made him clean out his phone so she could put the pictures back down and never smell marijuana. When she smelled marijuana, she told Eric that she didn't like it, and when she could smell something that did not smell marijuana, he smelled it too. Once he had done this, she smelled some marijuana and she did not like it either, and she would not smell it any more. On another occasion, she looked at Eric while he did yard work, and she saw that he was smelling flowers. She thought that he smelled marijuana. So she told him that she didn't like how he smelled flowers. She gave him a bath, like she had told him

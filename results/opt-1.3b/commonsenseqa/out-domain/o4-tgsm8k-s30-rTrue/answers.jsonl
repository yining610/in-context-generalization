The wind that blows through the feeder attracts birds that congregate around it. It also attracts bugs that live on and within the feeder. When the birdfeeder is full a bird drops and falls into the feeder. How much does a bird that gets swept by the wind fall into the feeder?\nOutput: A bird that gets swept by a wind gust falls in the feeder and weighs 2.9 pounds.\nEach bird that falls in the feeder is 3.3 pounds.\nEach bird drops and falls in the feeder on an average of twice per hour. So each bird that is swept by the wind falls in the feeder about twice per hour.\nEach bird weighs 3.3 pounds. So the total weight of each bird on average at the height of 20 feet is 5.1 pounds.\nSo the total weight of birds that fall through the height of 20 feet equals 5.1 pounds. After 10 minutes (10 seconds) the total weight equals 5.3 pounds.\nSo there were about 1,500 times the total weight of all the birds in the feeder each 10 minutes.\nThus, when the full feeder is 20 feet tall there are an equal number of birds at the feeders for 10 minutes.\nSo the total birds at the feeders equaled 1,500 times the weight of all the birds at the feeders.\nThus, 10 minutes is equal to 20 times the weight of the 300 birds at the feeders every 10 minutes.\nThus there is an equal number of birds in the 20-foot feeder each 10 minutes because the 30-foot feeder had 500 birds.\nSo the 9-foot feeder had 300 birds and the 27-foot feeder had 200 birds.\nThus, the total weight of the birds at the feeder when it was 25 feet tall (the height at which the feeder would reach the ground) was 450 pounds.\nThe total weight of the birds in the 100-foot feeder was 450 pounds and the 102-foot feeder had 450 pounds.\nThus, the number of birds in the feeder increased by 450 times between the 10-foot and the 27-foot height", "answer": "C: bitterness"}

The restaurant also has a small grocery store and carries a wide variety of produce. The name comes from the owner\u2019s fondness for penny candies.\nThere is however, a problem. There is only one parking lot for the restaurant. It is situated in a shopping center which is surrounded by streets.\nDue to parking constraints, the restaurant\u2019s customer numbers are quite low. The owner sees this as a problem. The only hope therefore, lies in the food. The owner\u2019s only hope is that she can convince other people to patronise her restaurant. She also hopes that the price will be a bit less than the normal price (which is a fixed amount of money charged each day).\nThere are some reservations about this idea \u2013 a number of customers are sceptical that they will be able to find parking to go shopping. A few have already said that they won\u2019t patronise the restaurant due to how expensive it is.\nFinally, the problem arises because the food is quite expensive, which makes customers reluctant to order something and go shopping. They don\u2019t want to be in the grocery store, nor do they want to drive all the way to the restaurant to find out what they fancy, nor do they want their children to go there in the first place.\nThese are all concerns and the owner\u2019s answer is that she will have to discount her food.

She puts a ten percent discount on the dishes they cook as well as the dishes they buy.\nThe customers react to the discount the first time the restaurant has a good day in the sales. The sales increases substantially and the sales climb above the fixed amount paid for each meal.\nThe next day the owner is concerned that the sale might be cancelled and the customers will be displeased, especially since she isn\u2019t able to give refunds.

A rancher wants to move 400 head of cows 60 miles to higher ground. He hires three trucks, two trucks must be loaded with cattle and the third must be loaded with hay. What is the total cost, in dollars, of the operation?\nOutput: $400.00 is all expenses.\nA week ago, in Mexico, the rancher hired 2 trucks.  Therefore, the final total is $200.00 per truck.\nThe three remaining trucks are $120.00 each.\nA week ago they purchased 4 trucks.  Therefore, today the total is $120.00 for each one.\nNow 4 trucks are needed.  Total cost of renting 4 extra trucks is $120.00 as well.\nSo total cost of operations is $120.00.\nThe cost of hay per truck is $5.00.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that the third truck is loaded with hay, the total cost of operations for this is $5.00 and it is not a big cost because all this is per truck.\nSo the final total of $200.00 per week is $200.00/3*3=<<2*2=10>>10.\nBecause it can be seen from these two answers that the total cost of operations in Mexico is $200.00.\nThen at a later date they would have to rent another truck and that would double the total cost of operations.\nSo the final cost of operations in Mexico would be $160.00 a week.\nGiven the first answer and the second and third answers it would take two week to reach the total cost.\nSo the total cost of operations so far is $240.00.\nThus, four days for the two cows and the four cows plus the two trucks.  Four days leaves you with nine days and they are the last two days of your vacation.  Therefore, you have only 11 days of vacation time.\n\nInput:Jason is a restaurant owner in Texas, and he wishes to advertise his restaurant.

The family rented a car for their vacation to get around.  The kids had fun, but as the kids aged up they had fewer and fewer hours that they could play together since each child had different work responsibilities.   What was the number of hours per day that each child could spend in the car?\nOutput: They each had 10-10\u2019s of hours to themselves and were able to play and have fun.  So, out of the total 36 hours they drove around, 14 hours were spent driving, the rest of them were spent talking to one another and playing games and visiting attractions.  The couple had no more than 30 minutes to spend with each child.  However, when there was a car seat in the back of the car, everyone was able to spend more time together.\nSo total hours per day traveled in the car for both kids was 27.5.\nAnd the number of hours they traveled over the entire week was 5 hours per day.\nSo, total time spent together per week was 5*5=<<5*5=55>>55.\nSo each day the average child only spent 55 seconds with each parent.  So that\u2019s an hour a day of wasted time between the two parents.  That\u2019s a good way to think about it if you\u2019re wondering why your children are so clingy.\nThus total time spent together over a 7 day week was only 3*55=<<3*55=1>>55.\nSo, each day on DisneyWorld was worth 15 minutes of the parent\u2019s time.\nSo, each child\u2019s time during their vacation week was worth $0.25.\nSo total money spent on travel over the 7 days of the trip was 2*2*55=5.

Your expenses are $500 per month and on average you need $1000 per month to survive.  Your income grows by 20% a year and total income grows by 30% a year.  Your annual income is $400,000.  How can you possibly lose the mortgage and other debts you currently have?\nOutput: If you save $100 a month for ten years and invest $20,000 for ten years you would have $900,000 by year 11.  In year 11 you would have $450,000 and you would then own your home.\nSo you could then owe the same amount at year 12, $450,000 and if you keep saving you could retire at 30.  But remember that you need to save 30% of your income for the rest of your life.\nSo $450,000 by year 11 = $15,000 = 300\nYear 12 = $225,000 and $7,000 = 40\nTherefore, you would need to save $45,000 by year 12 = $100,000 in order to retire.  Note that if your retirement plan was a Roth IRA, that would leave you with a yearly savings amount of $1,300 if you put $100,000 into the plan each year (assuming that you had to do nothing with that money).  Even a 401K will have a yearly savings amount of around $1000 if you were a non-retiree.  So it\u2019s not a bad strategy.  For example, if you save $10,000 every month for ten years and then save another $10,000 on top of that each year after that, if you did nothing with that money it would add up to $160,000 at year 17.  But you can\u2019t just invest it in the stock market and think that you\u2019ll get rich investing it.  In reality, no investment will ever give you more than a 25% return on your investment, which would probably leave you with a few hundred dollars instead of a few grand.  But that $160,000 at age 17 would be way more than your $15,000 would be in a few", "answer": "B: symphony"}

The price is $500.00 for a car, or he can buy the car for $375.00. In which quantity will he buy the car if he sells it?\nOutput: He sells it to one person, they\u2019ll pay him $500.00 for the car.\nOne person buys a car, pays $500.00 for it, gets it for free. They will pay $275.00 for the car they bought.\nSo if he buys 3 cars in a year, and sells 1 car per year, he ends up making $275.00 per year. And that person has to pay him $275.00 for that car.\nThe question is now $275.00 x3=$4,125.00 for 3 cars, or 3 x$375.00=$6,150.00 for 3 cars and the person who bought the car has to pay him $550.00 for 3 cars\n\nInput: A businessman has four cars.

{"text": "A. The only choice is C.\nFor someone without immortality, time goes in different ways depending on what time in the future his death takes place.\nInput: Tim was 10 at the time that he left his house from school.  He wanted to ride his bike home.  It took him 1.5 hours to ride from his house to his neighborhood.  His bike weighs about 50 lbs.  He would have to carry the bike 50 yards to the curb and then walk the rest of the way home.  He would need to cross a street 5 times in order to get home.  Assuming he completed the 1.5 hour ride, it would take 8 hours to walk and travel the 2 miles to the curb and back home.  Tim needs 60 minutes to complete the entire trip.  Since he spent roughly four hours at home, it would take 48 hours to complete the trip.\nOutput: The decision is either A or B.\nSo this is for 2nd choice, the deciding factor is timeliness of death.\n\nInput: A bird flying home from an exotic part of the world lands safely on an aerobatic flight and makes it safely to its perch.

He makes the landing in four minutes, and the pilot is in terrible overall shape.  The bird tells the pilot that it is a great flight and that everyone seems to have a good time.  The pilot continues to make the long flight, but as he is beginning to leave the flight deck, the bird has an idea and asks if he can ride the wheel.  So the pilot gives the pilot two more weeks to fix his plane before flying the bird.  He then makes a stop at the bird\u2019s favorite restaurant, and tells them the bird asked to ride the wheel on the way to the restaurant.\nOutput: The bird has been riding the steering wheel for six months.\nSince the plane is now in such poor shape, an inspection is planned.  So the pilot orders the plane to be shut down and the bird is reassembled.  The bird is now traveling at 100 knots per hour, and the pilot can\u2019t decide which engine to fire.

Which three items is she going to give the horse for the next 2 week so it can continue to be fed for those two weeks?\nOutput: She gives him a bucket of oats, half a cup of barley and 50 cents.\nSo she saved $300.00 in $5.00.\nShe paid $700.00 for the horse.  The horse will consume $700.00 in $5 dollars a day.  So, she saved $200.00 in $2.00.  In total, she saved $800.00 in $10.00.\nSo the last number was $200\n\nInput: A student starts a new home building/renovation business with her family.

How much does she get in business?\nOutput: She gets $3,500.\nAll her inventory costs (including labor and supplies) are $2,650.\nThus, after the first year she\u2019ll make $2,650 in sales of house parts.  So, $3,500 = $3,650 in sales.\nSo the final number was $3,650.00\n\nInput:A mechanic wants to increase the percentage of cars he sells to", "answer": "C: big city"}

Does the person still make $50,000 a year? (a+b)*(1-15)=<<35,000/(1-15)=$35,000\nOutput: The new homeowner makes $47,000 a year.\nSo the total cost of the trip to the new house is $35,000.\nSo the next calculation is: the number of expenses is 5 * $35,000\nSo the additional expenses cost the new home owner a total of $47,000\nAnd the total of the expenses and the additional expenses is: $47,500.\nThe next calculation is: $40,000/(23-47,500)/((16+35.50)*$40,000)\nMultiplying this by the total cost of the car trip and the number of trips each month, is: the car price was a little more than $50,000. The additional monthly cost for the car is: $37,500.\nMultiplying this amount by the number of trips each year, for 15 months, to see the house, as the initial expense costs $1,500, then multiplying this by 15 months and the number of trips, and then multiplying this by the price of the car, and then multiplying", "answer": "B: fire"}

The rent is on the house for 3 months.\nInput:The rent is 3X6=<<3*6=12 >>12 months.\nTotal cost for 3 months is: <<3*6=60>>60.\nSince it costs 3X60*12=<<60*12=400>>400, the total cost for 3 months is $400\n\nThe computer/laptop desk is going to cost $350.00. The room was already rented for 3 months for $300.00. So the total cost for 3 mo is $300.00 and then there is $50.00 for the desk. The total cost for 3 mo $300.00, the desk $50.00, and then there is\n$50.00*3=<<$60.00>>$360.00 so the final answer is $360.00\n\nInput and Output:1.

Given their limited parking, are they wasting their time with this service? The reason the one-way shuttle goes to both places at once is to save them money. Tell the story of how it works.\nOutput: There are 2 ways to look at this. The customer is saving time and money, the agency is wasting time, and the customer is the only one with savings thus eliminating any other potential benefit.\n(a) The customer can save in travel costs for driving to and from the airport twice per week, thus reducing the total travel costs.\n(b) There are 2 free transfers to/from one side of the rental office, thus saving time.\n(c) The shuttle is more efficient than hiring 2 car-rental agents to drive the customers to meet the client\u2019s needs.\nLet\u2019s take a look at what the above choices imply.\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nInput: The customer wants to rent a unit at their vacation home this spring; rent is $550.00 a week. What is the number of car-rental days expected this Spring? The answer: the minimum rental is 10 days. If the customer uses a car rental for just 3 or 4 days, does that make the customer a money loser or a winner?\nOutput: He is a millionaire. That is a winner. That means that he is an outlier in the universe of life that occurs around that person.\nIf the customer is looking at saving money, and that is their primary motivator, then a winner is guaranteed. But if saving is less his primary goal (as it probably is of the customers), then we will see more money being lost than saved. We must consider what is the total sum of all his savings in an economy that rewards winners and losers; that is, what has he saved.\nAs long as he saved at least 10% of the total value of value of the money he saved, he is a winner. However, he has probably not saved 10% of the total of his savings. So if we can only deduct the 10% of his savings as a result of the use of the vacation home, he probably has only saved 5%.\n\nInput: For years, people used horse", "answer": "A: good health"}

Any items you wish to bring, but must have on your trip.\n\nSince the island has no roads, how much should you be prepared to spend?\nIn general, you can spend up to 20 times the amount of money as your income.  So for $100, you can expect to spend $400.  So if your house material is $100 you can expect to spend over $1200.  Your estimated expense for tools and materials is $15,000.  If you include the cost of a home in this estimate, you can expect to have an approximate value of $30,000.

{"text": "You can park in any area.\nSince a parking lot is not considered an actual \u201croad\u201d, you can enter the location in any place in the parking lot rather than trying to determine your exact destination (e.g., if you enter from the left side of the lot, you should use the exit on the right where it says \"Right on Main\").\nExample: The lot next door to a roller coaster is a large park. The roller coaster is only on one side of the lot. You enter the parking lot on the other side of the complex. You are on the left side (right after a sign in town that says, \u201cNorth side of the lot\u201d) as you come from the entrance of the parking lot to the roller coaster. You park in the left hand area.\nSince there are two sides of the lot, you can\u2019t enter off it, because that would mean you took \u201ca new road\u201d, making you leave the lot (again, since this isn\u2019t an actual \u201croad/street\u201d, you can still use any other road!).\nThe only other alternative is if your car is in an area with a fence. You would need to park in a non-fenced area.\nAnother possibility is that your car is in a \u201cno parking\u201d area, since it might be considered unsafe (e.g., you might not want to use the only exit on the lot!). But your answer is not really related to this type of question. So if the \u201cno parking\u2019 sign is on the right, you can use the left exit (or, if it is on the left as well, you can use either of the entrances), since those would be \u201cways\u201d to exit the parking lot.\nNow, if you entered the lot through the street entrance, you\u2019d need to back up and enter this alternate road to your desired destination. E.g., you may be able to turn left and drive left through a parking lot, but then you\u2019d have to take back a right \u201cway\u201d at the end of the street to exit the parking lot (since the street ends before the roller coaster does).\nIf your car was parked on a sidewalk, then you would have to take a different \u201cright entryway\u201d.\nWhat alternate road would you take in this situation, though?\nIf you had a golf cart and entered the parking lot from", "answer": "D: amusement park"}

{"text": "C\nSo the final answer was C\n\nSolution Preview\n\nThis problem is very similar to the one below in that the answer is given for the whole scenario, but in different order and numbers of animals. The number of animals is given in the number of days, but unlike the problem shown above, it will be 1-14 and not 15-28. In this particular example, the answer will be 20-14. The total number of hours is given in terms of the total hours that a person will have for driving. In the first case, if you go to town at 60 miles per hour and back every time there is a storm, then you would drive 20 days a month. If you go to town each day only 3 times, then you will drive 12 days out of a month. In the second case, you would only go away 3 times a month. This is slightly different since each trip is only 6 hours long. There are many times when this is actually better in that it will be much tougher to figure out how many hours each trip adds up to as you are driving from town to town.\n\nThe main problem with the first is that the answer will be much smaller, but with the second it has the opposite problem. In the first case you will have the question of how many hours per month you will have available for driving a vehicle and this can be answered by figuring out how many hours each day that you will be spending in the vehicle each month. So for instance, if you use a carpool as the answer, then you will be driving the vehicle once every 3 hours. This will give you a rough idea of how many hours a week you will have time for driving.", "answer": "C: red barn"}

For example, every weekday at 3.00 p.m., he rents it out for six straight days at $10.00 per day. After 2 days, the next morning, he rents it out for 20 days at $30.00 per day. On the last day, he rents it out again for 10 days at $50.00 per month. What is the total cost of renting out the horse carriage in 12 consecutive days?\nOutput: The total cost is $100.00 x 12 = $600.00\nSo each day Jason rents the carriage twice; he spends $300.00 to rent the horse carriage for a total of $600.00.\nThis equates to 3600.00 hours spent in the car rental industry during 12 consecutive days.\nSo the final answers are 3600 plus 12=4800 in 13 consecutive days, 4800 plus 24=6,600 in 8 straight days, and 4800 plus 16=4,600 in 6 consecutive days\nSo the final answer for each day is 6,600\n\nInput: Melissa lives in the country.

Which gallon does she buy at town on Sundays?\nOutput: The federal legal minimum price for a gallon of gasoline in Melissa\u2019s town is $1.35.\nSince gasoline is purchased in town on Sunday, the $1.35 is reduced to $0.53.\nThus, she pays $1.35 plus 52 x 17 = $0.27\nIt would take the following days to pay off the $0.27. If she takes the 8 hours to fill the tank that she is on the move for, those 16 consecutive days, her bank account will be $0.27 less than the $1.35 she paid the first day. So Melissa will be on the move 12 straight days for a total of 16 = 60 hours.

The farmer would like to sell his crop to the new grain elevator a week ahead of schedule.\nSuppose for a fact that the farmer pays $25/ton for transportation over a 10-mile route to sell his crop at the new elevator, will he find that buying the same amount of grain from the same producer at a later date for less than five percent more will actually increase yield?\nOutput: If the farmer\u2019s yield is decreased by only 5 percent due to driving to town each week rather than bringing the crop locally from his own fields, then the farmer will have sold more grain in the past, and for less amount of time, during his current trip to town; thus he has already been profitable and increased his cash flow.\n\ninput: A man is going to a casino.

He has $35.00 in his checking account and $5.00 from the grocery store, so he determines to charge $35.00 for each bottle.  To keep it simple, he uses a 3% withdrawal rate (15% discount).  So the total fee he wants to charge is $55.00 after account charges.  He plans to divide the money out into 2 trips and then takes the rest as a check.  He\u2019ll get a check 3 months after the vacation in the mail.  The total bill will be $150.00.

(See answer 1)..\nAnswer to 1 is \u201cscab\u201d. The way it is normally removed with a knife is by placing the onion on top of it then flipping it over so the skin face down is touching the ground.

His first lift truck was 20 feet long and made 9 feet of travel distance per hour. At a rate of speed of 15 mph, the lift truck delivered 3 cars per hour. An average lift speed of 45 mph, then, will require a lift truck that is 36 feet long, 2 stories high with a travel distance of 30 miles per hour per load per lift.  If the lift truck moves at 45 mph for 30 miles, how many cycles will the lift truck average in an hour?\nOutput:\nThis is a difficult question, though I think the lift truck will average 45% of the speed in an hour!\nNow, if it were working just at 15 mph, then it would average 30% of 45%, which means it would average 24% of 60 mph in an hour.\nSo I think it will average 50% of 90 mph.\nNow 50% is 60 mph, then 15 mph is 45mph and 10 mph is 30 mph, then it is 24 mph.\nSo it is 24/60=25.25%.\nSo the new lift truck will have an average travel time of 12.5 miles per hour in a load up and 15 minutes off.\nSo the total travel time should be 15.0 miles per hour.\nSo my final answer is 15.0 miles per minute which is 5.5 miles per hour.\n\nInput: A company is working hard to make more money by making an automobile more expensive.

How would you pay for all this?\nOutput: In most cases the electricity, water, and gas will be provided during the first year in exchange for the appliances.\nIn addition, the landlord will provide a $500.00 credit against your rent should you choose to move elsewhere within your first year rental.\nThus, you would normally have to pay $750.00 for an apartment of one story.\nHowever, since the shower, sink, and refrigerator are all included in the rent, you pay $500.00 for a unit with all the appliances.  This means a total of $1,550.00.\nYou would then need to pay $250.00 for an electricity, water, and refrigerator each month.\nSo the final total for each of your three options would be $750.00 + $500.00 + $250.00 = $1050.00\nThus, you would be required to pay $750.90 each month or $850 each year\nSo the final answer would be $850.90\n\nInput:John has two sons. He lives alone. He bought 1,000 boxes of bread. His wife's brother-in-law has given him 1,000 boxes of chicken wire and is giving John the rest of the boxes over the break, when he\u2019s at work, for $40.00 per box. What's the cost per box of chicken wire?\nOutput: The cost per box depends on how wide you choose to make the holes in the chicken wire.  A 1x1 box of chicken wire is $0.80/box while a 2x2 box is $1.00/box.\nSo the cost per box is $18.00 for a 1x1 box and $21.00 for a 2", "answer": "A: outside"}
{"text": "In the fruit-tree market, the fruits cost 99 cents.\nIn the refrigeration school, the fruits cost 50 cents.\nIn the engineering school, the fruits cost 10 cents.\n\nInput:John has a farm with 2,400 head of cattle. A single calf can be sold for $35, which is an annual profit of $17,000. One quarter of the profit can be used to set aside 10% for growth. Half of the profit can be reinvested to create 10% more profit in two years.\nWhen one acre of hay costs $55 dollars, it can cover 5 cows and is sold for $3/cow. So one quarter of the profit can cover 8 cows, which is a profit of $3,000.\nWhen one acre costs $300 dollars, it can cover 20-40 cows, which is a $5,000 profit.\nThe other half of the profit covers feed, which is $75 dollars/cow. There is a $25 dollar/cow loss as there is a loss in hay. There is a loss of $10,000 per year of productivity.\nA one-acre crop costs one dollar per acre. The crop is sold for $30 per acre, so one quarter of the profit is $10,000.\nA three-quarter crop costs three or four dollars per acre. The crop must be sold at a minimum of $50 an acre.\nThe entire crop can only be sold at a minimum price of $100 per acre. If it sells for less than $100 it loses $50.\nWhen the entire crop is sold for $400 per acre, the income is $4,500.\nSince it sells for less than the minimum price, all of the profit covers the seed and the livestock.\nIf a farmer plants a crop, it can be sold anywhere. The farmer can sell the crop for a profit of $100/acre.\nThe farmer can sell it for a loss of $65.\nAfter two years, the farmer can set aside $20,000 for growth.\nSince there was only a loss of $40, the farmer can use $40,000 in the third year for growth.\nSo the farmer can set aside 30,000 per year per acre.\nThus, the farmer can set-aside 40% of the crop per year.\nEach year, the profit is about $60,000 per acre.\nSo the final annual income is about $120,000", "answer": "C: san francisco"}
{"text": "Choose A.\nLet's say he lives in a city with an electrical market. He lives in St. Cloud, MN. To buy a 200 ampere 60-kilowatt power supply, he would have to spend $600.00. Also, to buy a 30-amp 240-volt 12-amp power supply, he would only need to buy $500.00.\nUsing his supply store's markup factor, that means that John will make a gain of $150.00.\nUsing the power supply business' markup factor to determine that John can make $150.00, he will now have saved $200.00. And, he has not invested even a penny of his own money in his supply store.\nSo in total, he has saved $900.00.\n\nInput: Bob is a retired high school teacher with a high school student. He has recently decided to become a coach again since he loves to be involved in his daughter's football and basketball teams. This student will need to drive a car for home and gym practices. Bob pays $70 for 3 months for a black Toyota Camry sedan and $40 for a red Toyota Camry hatchback sedan. If Bob chooses a 1-month rental, he must pay $170.00. If Bob chooses a 2-month rental, he has to pay $200.00. Bob also pays $45.00 for full-time insurance on the vehicles.  How much in money was the total cost of the rental for Bob?\nOutput: Let's assume that Bob pays $170.00 and he has the savings from the one-month rental plus the insurance, which is $275.00. In total, Bob will need to pay $600.00 to purchase the car.\nBob will have to find additional means of income. He can try advertising locally, or selling his art on Craig's List. He can also join a professional sports team, and donate his salary toward the purchase of additional motor vehicles. Thus, in total, he will have to save $550.00 in order to make the purchase.\nSo his total costs for the second rental is $720.00.\nThus, in real dollars, Bob will use some other means to purchase the second rental.\n\nIf you choose B, then the answer is\n$700 x 3 =\n$720 =\n$120 =\n\nInput:  A group of researchers need to find out the best place to visit.

One of his paintings will cost $10,000.  The other will be $10,000.00. If they work for 15 days on their paintings, they should finish in 3 months and make enough to cover their rent.  They will make $500.00 and sell the paintings for $1,100.  This works out to $800.00 for John.  They will make the same amount working for another 6 months.  John should only work at home but if he works at a place where people wear costumes, he should charge more than $2,000.00 for the costume work.  What happens if John puts on an act of putting on an act of putting an act on an art show?\nInput: John will charge $2,000 for the costumes.  He will get 10% of the gross.  10% of $2,000 = $750.00\n15 days of work would cost John $150.00 and he will bring in $75.50.  $75.50 is $150 / 3.\nHe earns $75.50/3 x $1,100.00 = $750.00 / 15 * 30 = $15,000.00\nThus John earns $15,000.  This is a gross of $150 / 3 * 15 = $750 * 30 = $1550.  John does not have to pay income tax on this work.  He pays only self-employment taxes (which is less than half the amount he would earn from his income from the paintings) because there is no wage paid.  This is a total loss of $1550.00.\nInput: If you take a taxi ride to the post office, the ride would cost $6.00. John drives himself and will cost $19.00. If he takes a taxi back, when calculating the fare, he will charge $19.00. Calculating 10% of $19.00 = 5% of $19.50.  He earns $5.50 from taxi rides and he brings in $9.50.\nSince John pays the driver $9.50 on average every 15 days, that amounts to $4.50 per day. John earns an average of $", "answer": "B: humor"}

Car B is 150 gallons. Car C is 150 gallons.\nSo each individual car will contain 90/150=<<90/150=60>>60 gallons of water.\nThus, each car will contain 60/150=<<60/150=100>>100 gallons of water.\nSo the final water capacity of the above vehicles is 60*60=<<60/150==160>>160 gallons\nSince each car holds 60 gallons total, a total of 160 gallons is contained in each of the above cars.\nAnd since the total water capacity of each vehicle is 160/160=<<80/160=60>>80 gallons of water so each car will only hold 60/160 =<<60/160=50>>50 gallons of water.\n Thus, each car will only hold 50*50=<<50*50=60>>50 gallons of water\nThus, each car has not more than 60/160=<<60/160=40>>40 gallons of water.\nTherefore, each car has not less than 50*50=<<80/160>>40 gallons of water\nAnd each car has only 20*20=<<20*20=40>>40 gallons less water than the other cars.\nSo the cars have enough water to fill all of the water containers in the houses, and therefor there is not sufficient water for the homeless people (i.e., the people in house 1) to fill several water containers that have been provided.\nThus, because the car (Car B) has less water than the car (Car A) then it has enough water for the house (House 1) to not have to supply extra water to the people who sleep in that house.\nThus, the car", "answer": "C: despair"}

Mary wants to focus on the people she is helping this month, what will most benefit her and her company? What makes for the most sales? What salesperson is most effective to employ?\nOutput: She will focus her sales effort on people she knows personally and are familiar with rather than a salesperson she is not familiar with.\nSince some people know the person already, there is less effort needed for the salesperson.  Because Mary is known for selling well with people she knows personally, she will likely be rewarded for selling well to others when she gets $350.00 per calendar month.\nAs it relates to her company, the person she knows personally will be rewarded with additional sales opportunities based on those customers who buy more than one rental during the year.  As a result of having a well-known person as a customer, customers will see Mary more as an asset to her company than the competitor.\nSince additional sales may occur, and she likes new people, Mary may also decide to hire new people, since she already knows them.\nSince having people hired brings new challenges, new sales opportunities could result.\nThus, Mary wants to hire people this month and focus on the people in February, who will be the most likely to increase her current income.\nMary will be effective in recruiting people in February.\nBecause she knows the people well, more employees will lead to new sales opportunities, and she will be compensated according to those sales opportunities.\nWith new sales opportunities coming in, Mary will be rewarded for hiring more people and increasing her current income.\nThus, Mary will be more productive and more successful than her current income would suggest.\n\ninput: 1.A.

In a typical month, each of the company's 200 employees needs 50,000 pieces of laundry.  However, the company needs 10,000 units of laundry in advance, enough to last a year.  For each of those 10,000 units\nThe first 7 units need to be rented for $35.25.\nThe last 7 units need to be rent for $45.25.\nThe total price of 50,000 units is $90.00\nSo, how much will this cost to the person that rents each of these units?\nOutput: The total price of 50,00 units is 40,000 dollars, because only 7 units were rented by the company for each of the days\nSince all the units were rented by the employees for 2 days each, that would result in\n2*0.5=0.75\nso, if the company had 120 employees, they would have rented out 120 units for each day\nThus, the total $40,000 it would cost them to rent out all the units of laundry for the time period, in an average year\nThe average annual cost for 120 x 9 units for the year would be $120/unit\n$120 divided by 6 =$90\nwhich is the monthly cost for each employee\nSo the total cost is $90/employee\nTherefore, the total cost of renting each of these units in one month is $90\nIt should be", "answer": "A: food"}

You work for $30 per day. You must have made 30 trips, which takes approximately 30 hours, over the last 6 months. Your travel miles covered 10% of the total miles traveled as you worked at the hotel. You are charged $30 per trip. If you commute to and from work, for a total commute time of 5-1/2 days, how much does your average charge range from $30 to $350 per day?\nOutput: The average charge depends on whether or not you use a car. If you do not use a car, your average charge can range from $30 up to $200. If you use a car, your charge can range from $25 up to $50. Thus, if you commute to work and also drive, your average charge does not necessarily change as compared to a trip without a car. Your average charge in a year is therefore a combination of your commute and your charge for the rides you take without a car (this is actually a combined average over the course of the year). The combined average is $150.\nYour average charge in a week is therefore $150 times 30 trips. Thus, over the course of the 6 months, your average charge was $600.\nSo, over the course of a year, your average charge was 60/60=<<6*60+120>>120.\nNow we have 3 options:\n1) Your average charge is $600 times", "answer": "C: music room"}

Therefore, employees spend their time doing a job that requires no moving cars. Therefore, they spend 7 of out 8 hours of the day in their work-at home location (e.g., the carport). Therefore, they spend 4 hours on roads, 2 on moving-related activities, 2 on cleaning for the work-at-home location, and 2 on golfing. Therefore, they spend 21 out of 40 hours out of the day at their work-at-home site; 2 hours of roads, 2 hours of cleaning for work-at-home, and 4 hours on golfing. Therefore: moving cars results in 1 hour of roads, 2 hours cleaning for the work-a-home, and 4-4 hours on driving. Therefore: people moving cars, roads, and work-at-home result in 72 hours of total activity of the 4 main categories. The total time spent in driving is 2 hours and 25 minutes; 2 hours on roads, 2 hours on moving-related activities and 2 hours on golfing. therefore: people moving cars, drivers, roads, and golfing result in 72 hours, including the 4 hours required to get from work-at-home to home-at-home.\n\nInput:Suppose that you can move the equivalent of 10 cars on an average day.

{"text": "A,D,E, C\n\nInput: A farmer has a field that is flooded one day in April to clear it off.  He takes his tractor to the same field the next day.  If the field is already covered in mud, what is the tractor load he can clear off in one day?\nOutput: If the field is already flooded he needs to remove his own tractor.  If it isn\u2019t already flooded he can cover it with a bale of hay or a bag of mulch.\nSince he is paying $500 for 2 days of driving time, all of the fields are underwater in the field.  Total tractor load is $700.00\nSo the total cost of the drive is $700.00 for 1 day out and $500.00 for 2 days in.\nSo the final total cost of the day is $500.00 for 1 day and $500.00 total cost of the 2 day drive was $700.00.\nThus, the total cost of the year is $700.00. Total cost of the winter year was $700.00\n\nFeeding sheep and cattle are a cost center. Where do you see the greatest cost in the food business?\nInput: The cost of feeding stock depends on the size of the herd.  The largest herd is $500 for a day.  The smallest herd is $100 for a day, however, there is no limit to the number of days you can feed.  The greatest cost to feed stock is the price of a high quality feed.  The cost of an average feed is $20.00/100.00 pounds of feed.\nOutput: Feeding sheep and cattle is one of the cost centers to a farm.  The smaller the herd the greater the cost for the price of feed.\nIn this case, the higher the cost of feed in the summer means higher prices for the meat and dairy products produced by the farm.\nIn other words, you see the greatest costs of feeding livestock are the cost of producing feed and the lower margin it has with more demand for food in the summer.\nFor example, the greatest cost of feeding cattle is the high price of feed the spring to fall.  The cost of feed the spring to summer is the production costs while the cost of feed the summer to fall is variable costs.\n\nOutput: A customer owns a farm that has a corn field that is producing 1,500 bushels of corn per acre for each", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

Mary is a hard worker and will try very hard to get good grades in college. She has trouble staying focused on studies, particularly because she likes to spend all her free period (school time) playing with her other children and eating out. She enjoys the thrill of an exciting race through the woods with her brothers or the thrill of a big game of \"candy crush.\" She is also into playing tennis and horseback riding.  Mary's oldest brother's wife is pregnant and wants Mary to move out into a cheaper neighborhood with the pregnant wife. This would give Mary more room to play games and be out with all of the other children.  The problem is that there is no way to buy a one bedroom apartment without also buying a basement.  She likes her current apartment and would like an apartment closer to where her family lives in the city.  She plans on getting a job at the end of the school year and doesn't want to move, but the rent is too high to afford on her own.\nOutput: She doesn't see why she should have to move if her family wants to live in their own space and she wants the kids to grow up without having to worry about the \"rents\" and to pay the kid's way.

I should have known better at the time and not bought the chicken!\nSo in this example we have already stated that there is about 10% left in the chicken. So the total cooking time is 32% and that is enough to cook the chicken.\nSo we only need to ask how long the chicken will be cooked in order to find out. Using the time remaining we can get more precise.\nThe cooked time (number of hours between when chicken goes into the oven and when the lid is removed until it\u2019s served) is called cooked/cooked weight because the weight of cooked chicken is proportional to the cooked weight.\nThe finished weight of cooked (cooked/cooked weight) is called cooked weight and it is the number of oz./lb the chicken was.\nSo for chicken with 60% cooked weight cooked weight of 52 oz./lb, the cooked weight comes to 64 oz./lb.\nSo in this case we need to have the cooked weight to tell us the finished weight. And the cooked weight is 64 oz./lb so in this case you will just need to add 52/64 to get the final weight.\n\nInput: A dog is running around a soccer field chasing a ball, and the person shooting the ball says to the dog, \"Come on you lazy dog, chase the ball.\"\nOutput: The dog turns faster than the person shooting the ball and chases the ball.", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

At this point we can deduct expenses of $150.00 per month at an 8% (or higher) rate. With this rate of expense we have the following: $250.00 = $350.00*8*3.2=$1450.00\nAs you can see, July\u2019s total revenue was $600.00 and August\u2019s will be $650.00 if Jason is able to meet his expenses.\nJason will get $650 in his account each month from the rental car business. Then he will use this to pay his employees in August which will bring his total to $1500.00 in August.\nThus, he earns $1500 * 13.8 = $1780.00\nAnd since he only pays out $1500.00 each month to the drivers, he will have another $450.00 remaining to spend", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

Why is the other guy working better than you if he\u2019s making more money?\nOutput: The better earning person spends time doing things that are leisurely like going to the movies and goes out to eat every once in a while.  So his time is better spent doing things that are non-leisurely.\nThus, the better earning person spends less than 1 hour a day on non-leisurely stuff such as cooking, gardening and cleaning up.  Thus the average time worked per week (in this case 12) is 30.2 hours.\nSo the average weekly time worked per week (3612 hours) is 18.5 hours.\nThus the average weekly monthly time worked per month (2,904 hours) is 36.5 hours.\nSo the annual hourly time worked total for the two guys is 2736 hours, or 5736 hours per year.  The annual monthly total per month is 30.2 hours per month.  Because they\u2019ve worked more than 60 hours in a month the total annual hourly time worked for those two guys is 2712+30.2 = 6,312 hours or $1260.  The annual total for the two guys per month is also 5736+30.2 = $12,600.\nSo their yearly total is $12,600\n\nInput: Eric worked for years as a stock operator and has been a farmer most of his life.

He will travel in his spaceship, the Columbia. If it takes an hour to fly back to earth, then it will take an hour to reach Mars. How many hours would it take for him to reach Mars?\nOutput:It will take him 8 hrs.\nSince the spaceship can travel around the earth at a speed of 33mph, it takes 8/33=<<8^33=24>>24 hours for the astronauts to travel to the moon.\nSo, since it takes an hour to travel around the earth, it will take 8 hours for him to reach Mars using the lunar ship.\nSo, since 7/24=<<7^(4)^24=12>>12 hours he needs 4/12=<<4^(6)^(12)^24=-8>>8 hours to reach Mars.\nSo, the final answer is 8\n\nInput:An airplane carrying 12 people is en route to Hawaii when a fire breaks out. The plane is carrying luggage, food and oxygen tanks. The pilot has 12 minutes to evacuate the aircraft and to reach safety.

{"text": "A,C,D,E,S,I,P are all true.  The large group could be called: A: A group B: A group C: A group D: A group alone E: A group E: A group\nOutput: A,B,C,D,I,P are the correct choices\n\nA: In a crowd (with more than 4 people), there are two types of leaders.  The leader stands alone and directs the others.  The leader points out which way is clear, or tells others which way to move.  Both people are important, but the leader is more important than the follower.  They are equal, but the leader directs the group better.  They are equal.\nSolitary does not apply.  People cannot be seen as leaders unless they first are leaders themselves.   They must be first before they can say they are leaders.  This leads to the question: if someone is a leader when he is still a follower, then is that leader still really a leader?  If they are not a leader, then he has failed.  If, however, he says he is a leader, then he is sure of himself, and should claim to himself.  (A great leader is never afraid of leadership.  This is how all great leaders are successful)\nE: Solitude does not apply to an event, though it could be described as a social event.  A group has a purpose (for example, hunting or working together) and there is a lot of activity during the event.  In a crowd, we all know that we are all in the same party, so some individual leaders are not needed.  The purpose of a crowd is clearly understood, so the individual leaders are simply spectators and not needed.  The group\u2019s purpose is clear, and most people are willing to make decisions according to that purpose.  This leads to an important point.  The groups purpose is always clear.  A group of people has one purpose.  Everyone knows what that purpose is, and everyone supports it.  So even a crowd can be described as a group\u2019s purpose.   What is the main difference between a crowd and a family or friendship?\nI: The social group has no purpose beyond being entertained.  Everyone joins because everyone wants to be there.  That ends the purpose, and the people go home.\nSolitary would be this crowd.  The reason for this group to", "answer": "C: small group"}

The total commute time to O\u2019Hare will be 365 plus 1/48 = >>365\nOutput: After 24 hours, the plane will have flown a total of 2 miles in 24 hours.\nThe distance between O\u2019Hare and home (the car) is 1 mile and the average commute time is 8 minutes so we will conclude the total time to home to be 8 minutes plus 1/48 = 32 minutes.\nThus: the average commute time for that hour in the car to O\u2019Harest be 8 minutes plus 1 hour = 48 minutes for a total of 60 minutes.\nSo the final word count count of 50 words is 60 minutes.\nSo for a 6 minute commute each hour, it will take you a total of 3 hours to drive to work for 6 hours.\nSo the final read-out for the 4 hour commute is read-out = read-out=3 hours + 2 hours = read-out=2 hours = read-out = 4 hours\n\nInput: One of the tenants in your building is a photographer.

The time of sunrise is 21 minutes. The actual time of the sunrise is 22 minutes later. The actual time of sunset is 23 seconds later. Then there are 21 minus 23 equals 30 minutes of daylight which, when the lights are on, increases by 23 minutes. Then there are 21 times 30 = 60 minutes at sunset.

A: the shop will serve only pizza and bar B: the shop will both serve beer and wine c: the shop will both be used on the weekend D: the shop will serve pizza and beer and bar c: the shop will serve alcohol but not beer and wine but not bar d: the shop will serve beer and wine, bar and office and pizza on weekdays f: the shop is used only to service food and the bar and the shop is used only for alcohol. What will it cost to build the shop?\nOutput: The shop will cost $650,000.00 and the bar will cost $300,000.00.\nEach year the average cost of the shop is $650,000. The annual cost of the bar is $150,000.\nSince both the pizza and the bar are self-serving, each is not as expensive as the other.\nSo the total annual cost of the two buildings is $1,500,000.00\nSince $650,000 will build three stores and a shop and $150,000 will build a bar, this works out to be $350,000.00\nSo the total annual costs of the shop and the bar are $800,000. The amount it costs to run both at full capacity are $350,000. This is nearly twice as much as the one-and-done stores.\nIt is interesting that the cost to operate the two shops is over twice as much as the bar.\nSo the total total annual costs of both is $1,050,000.00\nBecause the shop and the bar and the office only cost $350,000. Each one of those are more expenses than running the shop with all three of the above costs combined. So $350,000. $350,000.\nSo the overall annual cost of the pizza parlor and the bar is $650,000 which means the shop has the same expenses as running the shop with all the above expenses added together.\nSo the shop has an annual operating cost of $650M which is about twice what the bar and $150k less than the one-and-dones stores.\nSo the", "answer": "A: smell smoke"}

When he asks Melissa if she has ever driven the tractor before, she says no and that she has no idea how to steer the tractor.  The salesman says that it will probably take him half a day to show her how to steer it.  What is her take home message here?\nOutput: The way to get the message across is to say it will normally take 6 hours to drive the tractor to a shop and back.\nThere are 100 feet of the street.\nAt first, the salesman will drive down 100 ft. to show her.\nBut halfway down the street, he will turn the tractor around so that she can see both ends.\nWhen he gets the distance down to the next quarter of a mile, he will take a final turn around so that she can still see both ends.\nThe tractor will probably drive the next quarter of a square mile with the back wheels at the corners.\nSo she gets the message that it should take 3 hrs to drive 100 ft to the shop and back (one direction), 30 mins to drive the last quarter mile back (opposite direction) and a total of 7.5 hrs to drive the whole way back.\nShe should decide at that point that 4 hours driving the tractor is okay.\nSo 4 hours is more than 15 minutes.\nBut she chooses 3 hours.\nThen she spends the next 90 minutes learning how to drive the tractor.\nShe starts out doing a back and forth with the back wheels at opposite corners along the full length of the tractor, over and back, down and back and then goes over and back and then turns around and turns around and back and back.\nIn the last couple of minutes, she has to steer the tractor by turning the throttle.\nWhen she does all of this, the tractor will drive a full quarter of a square mile.\nSo she has 3 hrs.  She will have 30 minutes of this driving the tractor in the beginning and another 30 mins of driving it after that.\nSo she chooses 2 hrs.\nSo she takes the tractor down 100 ft. with the back wheels at left ends.\nShe realizes that, with the way she\u2019s already moving, the tractor will eventually turn around to the right and she has to continue to steer the tractor by either turning the throttle or by turning the throttle.", "answer": "B: buy"}

His business is dependent on high water production and his livestock will be lost.  Therefore, he purchases a water tank which is then turned around, so his livestock will continue to receive water even as the flooding continues.  The farmer\u2019s business is now on the defensive, and the family\u2019s financial situation is tight.  What are some possible solutions for the farmer?\nOutput: When the water from a tank runs out, there is nothing else to tap into. To replace the tank, the farmer would have to have a continuous source of drinking water. If a natural disaster occurs, this source of drinking water might be gone.  The farmer would have to buy an additional tank to take care of the family\u2019s current needs, or move the property altogether.\nIn order to replace the current supply of drinking water, the farmer would have an alternative, and would have to move the property entirely.\nTo replace the original tank, the farmer would then have to buy a second tank and build a connection that will keep the farm connected to the drinking water supply, even when the flood has receded.\nSince no system is perfect, there would inevitably be some failures, and the farmer would face these failures in the hope of protecting his business.\n\nInput: There\u2019s a small town near me where the school is so small that teachers, principals, and others (who know the students) all meet in the cafeterias.

The apartment is owned by the other and he has 4 roommates; one is in the bed room, another is in the kitchen, another is in the dining room, and the third is in the living room.  The man keeps 1/12 of his kitchen/dining area and the other 3 roommates keep 7/12 of their rooms.  The total floor space is 905 square feet.  The man asks the other for permission to take 10/12 of his kitchen.  Asking the other for permission to use 14/12 of the apartment is the correct answer.\nThe first thing that will happen is the kitchen can be used for a total of 6 hours, but the 7th person will want 1/12 of it for himself.  This 6 hours total for 6 people results in 6 hours per person = 3.5 hours in total so only 3 hours per person = 1.5 hours spent by each person in the kitchen for a total of 7 hours.\nAnd because of that amount of time, the total floor space for a total of 905 is reduced from 905 square feet to 895 square feet.\n\nInput: A is 3% below B in a test.

{"text": "In the U.S. there will be more farmers growing bees in their fields for the same amount of land. As a result there will be more farmers selling their honeyed bees to those who do not live in the U.S. because the laws that govern honey is different in countries outside the U.S. and different regions of the U.S sell more honey. This is the equivalent of selling a hamburger meal in the U.S to someone who eats one hamburger meal each day and drinks beer one night per week.

In other regions, a beekeeper will locate a colony and a beekeeper who collects bees for honey will find a beeswax producing hive or hive.\nOutput: In the United States there will be more beekeepers with bees. As a result there are more farmers selling their honey to the beekeepers who have bees. The U.S. only produces 12.7% of the world\u2019s honey. The other countries account for the remaining 66.3% of the world\u2018s bees.\nSo the final solution is 132\n\nInput: The world\u2019s population currently stands at 7 billion, and each new child adds around 150 people to the world\u2019s population.  There are 13-13.5 billion people in the world today, and each new year adds around 75 people to the world\u2018s population.  For each additional child that is born, the world\u2019s average life expectancy increases by one day, and that\u2019s good for everyone on the planet.  So by 2050 the world population will reach an estimated 9-10 billion.  Assuming that by then the population has already hit the world\u2019s 7 billion number, the world\u2019S average life expectancy in that year is expected to be 75.  So by the year 2050 the world\u2018S population can expect to live roughly 50 years less than current life expectancy. There are only 5 years in a decade, and by 2050 only 45 days are given to each person to live. Thus, there is less than 6 hours in that year for each person to accomplish anything worthwhile.\nOutput: Population growth means that the world has only one year left to live and there are 45 days left in the year.

Divorce: 25x1/2 = $2500.00\nSince the net loss for each case is $1500.00\n4. Divorce + PNU: 25x1/3 = $2000.00\nThus, the net loss for each divorce case ($1000.00) is $(500.00 - $500.00) - $250.00\n5.

Instead, they give a guess.\nIn case you missed it, they had a row about.  John was upset and Jane was getting upset and neither was willing to speak up on behalf of the other.  And since sex in any manner in any relationship does take some planning it made sense (on their part) not to reveal to the other that they had been together before.  Jane is not in a relationship right now so she does not know what she is talking about.\nThe third option would be to have an electrical circuit, but that is somewhat different.  They do not see a long-term relationship in between this time.  They do not have to know now, but should it ever become relevant they would be able to tell each other exactly when they had sex.  But they do not want to get into that here.\nThe final option is dancing, but they have done that before, too.  They do not look for a long-term relationship from dancing.

{"text": "Each day, according to the answers given, the chef cooks dinner, makes breakfast and spends one hour preparing a meal for the rest of the family.\n\nInput: A farmer has two pigs, one cow and two goats. If his wife wants them all to work for her one day she can sell them at $100 each. If she\u2019d rather have three of them working for her one day each month and pay $90 for all three animals she can offer them all $600 each.\nOutput: If the farmer is a woman, and sells her animals for all 3 days $300 is enough to cover the wages of 1 ox, 1 sheep, and 1 goat. If she sells them one at a time and they are not working as hard as the animals for which they would be paid $600 a month she will get two oxen and a sheep and make $200 for each animal\nSo for $300 she will make $200 when animals for which she pays only $450 are present. And when these animals are not present with the same value as that which they\u2019d be paid for the farm is only producing $200 worth of goods per month.\nSo the final outcome is $600 if she sells them all at once and gets only $400 if she can sell them 3 times for 3 days for $200.\nSo we\u2019re getting something like $2 a head to work these animals for 3 days per month. If they are working for $600 each they make approximately $240 a month.\nSo the answer comes from the other question: What is $200 worth of goods at the farm per month?\nAnd the formula for getting an answer is: What is $2 worth of goods at the farmer\u2019s farm?\nSo we have $1200 worth of goods per month on the farm compared to $1200 worth of goods for $600 so $600 gives us an answer.\nSo our final answer is $2 per head of livestock.\n\nInput: At a restaurant, the restaurant manager is asking the chef about the cost of using a microwave oven instead of a frying pan to fry the food.

If so, what are the total dollar amounts for both those things?\nOutput: When you rent a hotel room do you get a receipt that shows exactly how much room you rented and exactly how much the hotel paid for that room?  The insurance would be something you\u2019d have to ask your insurance company for.  So let\u2019s say there is a company called Delta Insurance. If you want to know your insurance bill after you\u2019re paid for the rental of your airplane I would think you need to call Delta Insurance.  Therefore I would assume that this is not something you\u2019d get a receipt for.\nSo we\u2019ll assume that Delta Insurance makes the payments to its insurance company. This must leave Delta Insurance with a large ledger from which to calculate their insurance bill.\nSo each rental bill must come in on Delta Insurance\u2019s ledger and then Delta Insurance must either multiply that ledger\u2019s dollar amount by the number of units rented, by the amount of miles the renters traveled per unit rental (the charge per mile rate) or by the amount of miles that Delta Insurance paid for (Delta Insurance doesn\u2019t pay the renters any more than Delta Insurance pays or receives from Delta Insurance).\nSo the final answer to the question is $2.92 per mile.\nThe following additional questions might be worth your time:\n1.

How do his costs work out?\nOutput: Total cost of equipment = $350. The farmer must sell some parts of the tractor to buy the gas, and he sells the extra parts for $40 each piece, so total cost is $350 + $40 = $350.\nThe total cost of the equipment then comes out as: Equipment, $350. Fuel, $35 ($100/day). Exertion, $200 ($600/day). Equipment, $350.  Expenses, $350 + $100 = $350.\nSo the final cost is: Equipment, $350 Total cost: $360 + $200 = $360. The farmer sells $200 of the equipment to make $400 ($200 - $100) profit.\nSo the final profit is, $110. So the farmer made $110 profits.\nSo the final output value is 110/360 = $100. So the farmer made, $100.\nBecause he still needed to buy fuel to have $200 worth of equipment, the total equipment costs are: Equipment, $350 + $200 = $450. Total equipment costs thus come out as: Equipment,$350 + $200 =$480.

A business analyst was hired to examine this situation.  What would you recommend the business analyst do?\nOutput:The business analyst should have analyzed the situation to the point where he had a clear picture of the full cost of operating the property before the client used the property for their vacations.\nEach vacation rental has the cost of renting it plus $120 as a daily rate.  It takes 2 vehicles to accommodate 60 people.  The total cost per day/week is $240.00.  Therefore it is not feasible for them to use both vehicle, so one vehicle has to be used for the entire vacation rental.  This means that the rental rate for 3 occupants (60) is $120.00 for 30 days.\nA second vehicle would be $80.00 for 2 weeks and would run each vehicle 30 days per year for $240.00.\nTherefore, because he did this analysis before the business owner hired him for the study, he concluded that the business owner would be much more comfortable having the second vehicle.\nHowever, his analysis did not include the additional cost for the rental car.  So he concludes that the business owner would need to have 4 vehicles, and that would cost $120.00 per trip.\nIf he had included the additional cost for the car rental in his analysis, the business owner would be comfortable using 2 vehicles.  He would calculate the amount of money it would cost him to use 4 and he would find that 2 vehicles would allow him to achieve that goal.\nBecause he did not do this analysis, the business owner hires a business analyst who should have done the analysis in the first place.\n\nInput:The cost of raising a bird in a pen is $60.00 per month.

{"text": "A=modern C=downtown D=neighbor's house E = downtown\nThe garage is open 24 hours, one of three bedrooms downstairs.  If there\u2019s a fire in the garage, how much time is lost to the fire due to the delay of the automatic doors closing in time to escape the fire?\nInput: The house was built in 1902 and the garage door has a spring brake that locks it in place before it reaches the \u201cclosed\u201d position.  How much time does it take to reach the closed position?\nOutput: Inertia and spring resistance prevent the door from closing all the way.  Inertia is time to travel (sustaining a spring) and resistance is the force to reach the closed position (sustained with the spring).  So the door need to be forced about the same time it takes to travel 3x3=<<3x3=9>>9 feet to reach that position to get the door fully closed in time for escape.  Thus, 14 minutes = 28.8 seconds = 1.5 seconds =.02 seconds.\nSo, if the door has a 1/2 seconds delay before closing to start the spring and only 3/2 seconds when it reaches the fully closed position, how much time will it take to reach the fully closed position?\nInput: The garage and the home were built in 1910.  The house had two bedrooms on the ground floor with a bathroom attached upstairs and a kitchen/dining room.  The garage could be accessed by stairs on the ground floor and the main floor.  The garage door was located under the stairs.  The garage door would only be accessible by stairs from a first floor bedroom and a second floor bedroom.\nOutput: The door has a 1 second delay and 10 seconds to reach the fully closed state.  The garage door is locked in place before it reaches full release so 15 seconds (2 + 10 times 2) = 27.8 seconds.  The time to reach the fully closed door is therefore 30 seconds!\nSo, 13 minutes = 4.1 seconds =.26 seconds.\nSo the door will take 13 = 11.4 seconds to reach the fully opened position.\nSo, in total, the entire house would take 15.6 seconds to close from the home.\n\nInput: If each person was to travel 2 miles each day, and only used public transportation, what is the per day per person cost to travel two miles each day?", "answer": "A: modern house"}

His neighbor complains that the pieces are too similar as if it were a compliment.  His neighbor tells everyone he knows, but his neighbors are so arrogant as to not believe a word of it, especially when they hear it from his neighbor, and when they see it for themselves.  In fact, they think it's insulting from the start.  So the carpenter says he's going to make a little competition.  He takes the pieces and puts them in exactly the same order, but different measurements on the outside.  It is obvious to everyone, no one can ever tell the two apart.  So this man starts putting together two pieces of wood and putting them together and finding out which is not shorter than the other.  Eventually they both have the same length, but their width is different on the outside.  Everyone is shocked by the similarities and is so impressed that the person who designed the saw didn't make it that there's not much to say and a conversation flows like a river.  After this competition, the people who are used to the wood from the neighbor's, have a hard time accepting the new wood.  This gets worse when the carpenter adds two pieces together as an example, and someone, not his neighbor, tries to correct him.  That person starts to wonder if the carpenter has really improved the wood, and if he should have told his peers about this competition or if they've just gotten used to the pieces.\nSo eventually everyone is surprised, or should I say upset, to find out that the two pieces that look alike, were not the same.\n\nInput: A farmer has 2 pigs.

They live in apartments in a townhouse complex.  The man has two children, an engineer and his wife, and his employees have one each. During a hurricane, a large part of the townhouse complex will likely be covered in water and the man will need to evacuate. He decides that he wants to live in the city to minimize any inconveniences caused by flooding. How can he keep the employees from needing to evacuate?\nInput: On August 5th, 2012 the family is living in a townhouse in the townhouse complex.

They all rent the townhouse and they drive to the town that night. How can he keep his employees from moving out?\nOutput: The engineer\u2019s family will be renting the townhouse, not his employers. They will stay in the townhouse for the rest of their time at the house. So, all of his employees are still working from home.\nThe house will cost an additional $500.00 to move, but will be covered by flood insurance.\nThus, they will be spending $500.00 of their own money on the townhouse, the engineer\u2019ll be paying out $300.00 of his own money, and the engineer and his family will need another $280.00 to pay for the townhouse.

Remember that these are all multiple choice problems, that is why there are multiple choices for multiple answers! It's like telling you \"you must pick three\" or, \"you must pick five\" when they are asking for six options. They aren't actually asking you to pick three or five, but rather you need to pick something, at least a category. In fact, they may use the phrase \"you pick\" or \"you pick something\" for multiple choices. Remember that we say \"you pick\", but it means only that you think about the answer as you go through the process. For example: You think you like chocolate but you haven't had any in a while. You think you like the flavor but you haven't tried any yet! So, \"you think\"? \"You pick something\"? \"Pick something\"? So, you must select one of these as your answer for the multiple choice question. Remember, like a normal text, they are a single", "answer": "C: playroom"}

One day while at her parents' house, her son began crying because he was tired of sleeping in a diaper.  She got him a diaper from the diaper pantry at Target and he cried again.  As soon as she could get him in the baby carrier she was going to return the diaper to the diaper pantry.  She asked the staff to get the diaper back because she didn\u2019t want the baby using the bedding for his naps on the weekends.  The next day, she got the same reaction again.  She decided to get him a new mattress.  However, the baby refused to sleep on the mattress and she cried all night because he would not sleep on it.  Finally, she decided to put him in his crib at her parents house and bring the crib in from her parents' house so he could sleep on his own bed again.

Each state has its own refund policy.  In New York State, they pay taxes on the refund from the prior year (if the amount is greater than $10,000) and the refund from the tax refund from the year before (if the amount is less than $10,000).  They also give the people who apply a refund the choice of either a tax refund that cannot be claimed back on their federal tax returns, or a refund that they may choose to claim back.

They\u2019ve had to pay out $9,000.\nOutput: Each state must apply these rules.\nFor New York State they must pay all taxes on the federal tax refund as well, and since the federal tax refund is larger than their state refund, they must pay a state refund as well so they must pay the taxes for that federal tax refund on top of that, and so on.\nSo the final total on these refunds will be:\nNew York * New Jersey * Pennsylvania * Connecticut * New Hampshire * Massachusetts\n+ Tax Refund * Tax Refund * Tax refund\n\nInput: The following is a simple game that is played in different languages.

The smallest of elephants takes 3 hours to take a shit. The fastest can do it within 1 minute.  If you\u2019re watching the elephant while the shit is going on, the best way to observe is to look at the animal\u2019s skin.  How long will it take to poop when the largest of elephants takes a shit?\nOutput: The smallest, fastest, longest of the elephant is still only 3 hours to shit.  But it takes the largest elephant 3 minutes, the second fastest 7 minutes, the third fastest 9 seconds, the fourth fastest 16 seconds, the fifth fastest 2 minutes, the sixth fastest 1 minute, the seventh fastest 10 seconds, and the eight fastest 7 seconds.\nThe elephant taking a shit must take approximately 6 minutes, which equates to the time it takes the biggest elephant to piss.  That equates to a shit time of 6 minutes 41 seconds.  So the most time the elephant will take to take a shit is 9 minutes.  The elephant that can take shits in a minute takes 1 minute 42 seconds.  So you\u2019re right, the tiniest, fastest, longest has taken 3 hours.  So there\u2019s an extra 20 minutes in that total shit time.\nSo the total shit time is 9 minutes and 41 seconds.  The elephant taking a shit lasts 1 minute and 42 seconds.\nSo the total poop time is 27 minutes.\n\nInput: When you purchase a car, you must drive for 6 months before you may rent.

Choices: A: hottest day B: coldest day C: driest day D: driest month\nOutput: hottest day\n\nInput:If the ground is moist, it could melt snow. If the snow is frozen, then it freezes. Why isn\u2019t the ground wet at the same time as snow is melting?\nOutput: The cold air at the top is warmer than the warm air at the bottom. It is called the stratosphere. The stratosphere is what keeps the atmosphere warm. It has warmed up at least twice as much in the recent past as it has warmed up in the past.\nThus, since the air above a snow layer is colder than the air at the surface, then this layer has gotten warmer then the surrounding air has gotten cold.\nSo, the snow layer above the frost layer is warmer than the frost layer below. Thus, the ground above this layer is not moist.\nThus, the snow layer below the snow layer would have melted, if the temperature beneath hadn\u2019t risen to meet the rising temperature above this layer. Thus, the ground is the same temperature as the snow. So the ground is not wet at the same time that snow is melting. The ground is as hard as a rock.\nThis leads to the conclusion that the ground is indeed wet.\nBut since the ground below the snow layer is still colder than the air above the snow layer, it still has not melted enough in the winter to make the ground moist. Thus, it remains frozen.\nThus, the ground is not as moist as the ice is hard. Thus the ground is not wet on the same time as snow melts. Thus the ground is frozen.\nThe ground, even below the snow layer, is still as wet as the ice. So, the ground is not moist on the same time as spring weather thaws. Since the ground isn\u2019t wet on the same time that spring thaws, it cannot be moist on the same time that summer weather starts. So the ground has not been moist enough for the ground to thaw.\nThus, the earth is not wet on the very same time the snow melts. Thus, the earth is not moisture.\nThus, the land is not moisture. Thus, the earth has not been wet on", "answer": "B: pennsylvania"}

How might he lose money?\nOutput: He loses money the first time he rents the car. But he still has the cars 3 years into his rentals.\nWhen he has to lease it again, he only saves $50.00 so that means he loses $50 in the first go.\nBut the second time he leases the car the car cost $200.00 because this car is not new and has mileage.\nThus the total loss is $200.00\nSo the total rental loss in the past 3 years is $200.00 so the man has a rental loss of $200.00.\nSo the final total for this man is $200.00.

How much rent will he pay, and what are the options he has?\nOutput: In order to rent a house there are 4 different categories:  the cost of rent is dependent on the number of bedrooms in the house, whether or not it has a hot tub, how much space it has, and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms it has.  The cost of a party rental is dependant on who makes the booking, the venue\u2019s cost, how much the venue holds, and how many people are in attendance.\nSo you have a $1,000 minimum rental per party and a $1500 minimum party size.  There are 11 rooms and 10 bathrooms in the house and each room holds 6 people.  This leaves a total of 16 or 6*6*6=81 people which is the minimum rental.  You need to rent 10 bedrooms or 80 people in order to have a reasonable standard of living for all the guests.  Now you can rent the house for 1.5 times the minimum rent or 150 people, or 150*10=160 people, or 160*10*20=120 people, or 120*10*20*40 people.\nSo the final rental charge is $1,100.00\n\nInput: A child is born and dies.

The most time-efficient way to do it is to put your hands close to your face and take a deep breath.\nSo you will need to find the distance you need to travel each day, divide it by 24 and then multiply that by 5.\nSo when you are driving to town, say your total distance every day is 15 miles, you need to figure out how much time to spend driving and how much time you will spend driving during the rest of the day.\nSo you need to split 15 miles of driving into five sessions, so for example your first session is 5 miles and your fourth session is 2 miles and so on. The only way to do this (which should be obvious to you by now) is to divide 5/5 by 24, so you get\n5/5/24 = 4 * 4 * 2 = 2 hours\nNow divide the 1 hour of driving by the 2 hours you will spend driving for the rest of the day and you get\n1 hour of driving/1 hour of driving = 13 minutes. (The exact number varies depending on the person and their driving style)\nSo the total driving time for the day is 14 minutes.\nIf you divide the 1 hour by the 2 hours you can divide that by 12 minutes and so on. So, to take the number of 15 miles divided by 12 minutes and multiply by 6 and divide that by 18, you get\n15 miles divided by 6 = 30 minutes\nSo you will need more time to drive than the time you saved by simply doing D.\n\nInput: A farmer rents a tractor.

She saw it jump off a rock and jump to the side.  The moose saw it leap and jumped to escape the falling rock.  She wanted to approach the moose and take a picture but was afraid of it leaping again.  The moose was so beautiful and the weather was so cold that she decided to remain on the edge of the forest and watch the sun rise and set.  She saw lots of moose on the trail and in the swamp.  However, once the sun set she saw far fewer moose in the swamp than she saw before it was dark.  She wondered if her fascination with wildlife is a factor in her desire to leave her job.  Her family wanted to visit her and she could spend the day in the forest.\nOutput: She has been fascinated with wildlife ever since and now that she left her job, she looks forward to spending every day working in the forest.\nSince she is employed, she spends no more than 7 hours a day in the forest.  Thus, her time spent each day at work is 12*36=<<12*36=24>>24 hours.\nSo her days spent in the forest will be 12*36*<24*36=24>24 hours.\nSo the final day at work is 24*36*24 * 24 = 720 hours.\nThe final number of hours worked at the job is 720\nThe total annual figure is 720 + 240 = $1200.00.\nThe annual amount of $1200.00 is $900.00+$720.00\nTherefore, the annual amount spent is $900.00 + 720 - $1200.00\nWhich is the better figure?\n\nInput: A man was told by his boss that he could not drive around for 2 hours on weekends.

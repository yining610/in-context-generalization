What does Adam make from the stock?\nOutput: He made 10.  The stock price is $2.60.  Adam sells the stock at a loss and makes a profit of $0.50.  He sells at $2.40 and his stock price is $2 and does not lose any money.  He makes 9.  Therefore, he earns 10 * $2 = $10 from the stock.\nThe company's stock price is $2, making Adam make 10/60 = $30 from the stock.

Which company is in the same problem position?\nOutput:The problem for John's company is a 20% decrease in sales, and they are also struggling with their stock price.  They now sell stock at a loss, and they also sell a large amount of stock to raise funds at a loss.  Their stock price has increased from $10.50 (in the previous quarter) to over $11 (in the previous quarter).  It is now down to $10.  It cannot go any lower.\nSolution:If their company's sales are down to $100, their company's stock price is about the same now, at $6.  They sell $120 worth of stock, and make a loss of $4 on the stock.  $4 * $12 = $160 from the $160 they sold stock.\nTherefore, John earns $(80-$120)/(120*$10) = $160 from the stock sold.\nSo,", "answer": "E: airplane"}

Answers: 10-14 cubic feet air, 2,700-8,000 pints water\nOutput: What is the volume of air in a 2-door, five-passenger, four-door, seven-seat car?\nSo, for a two-door, five-seat car, the cubic feet of air would be:\n\nSo, the final total volume of air in a vehicle is:\n\nThe answer is 36,000 cubic feet of air.  A 10-foot wheelbase car weighs in at over 1,700 pounds.  Thus, 30-pound passenger = 36,000 cubic feet or 37,000 cubic feet per passenger.\n\nInput: What are the highest and lowest pressure altitudes the earth has ever been at?

Given supply, how is that supply related to demand? Output: The price is related to supply when supply is short and demand is high. In fact, if supply is high this means that demand is high and when supply is short this means that supply is low. So the price is related to supply of food and demand of food. If supply was long, the short supply would give the price higher. The inverse would usually be true for demand.\n\nInput:What is the total length of the universe? Input:The universe has 10^30 seconds of length. Calculate how many seconds in 10^30 there are in the time unit measure of a day. Output:The length of the observable universe (10^30 of length) is about 0.000000038 seconds. Therefore ten^30 seconds in 10^30 is the age of the universe. Because 10^30 seconds is about how long the observed universe has been observable, it appears that the age of the universe must be 10^30. However, the true age of the universe is not 10*30 or 10^30, but about 10^14. However, the actual age of the universe is only about 10^28. However since 10^28 is a natural number, it is not an observable number. Therefore when you ask a question about length, ask about age using a natural number.\n\nInput: What happens to a dog that tries to leave a home?

I used an \"un\" when counting how many people Adam said he knows and was correct.\nSo \"3\" is correct\n\nIn Italian, \"un\" is one and an \"un\" is also two. So, in Italian, \"un\" equals one when counting how many people. And, \"un\" equals two when giving an answer for how many people.\nSo \"3!\" is correct in both the sentence and the answer when \"un\" is used as a count in one of these questions:\n\nIn the last two sentences, where you count 3 and give \"un\", you use the \"un\" in the sentence to tell us the count in the answer. But in both sentences the \"un\" is different.  So \"2\" and \"3\" are not correct.\nThe \"un\" in \"2\" changes the answer, though.  So, \"3!\" is correct.\n\n**For accuracy, I will note that you did not use an \"un\" when you give the same answer in English!**  My example in this answer also shows two \"un\" for each person in the sentence\n\n**For this example.

You can count them as days of the week, days of the month, holidays, or the month itself.\nOutput: If you count the workouts as days of the week the number of days in a week is equal to 20. (So if you count the workouts as both the days of the week and the month)\n\nInput: How many days in a row can you count without missing any workouts? You can count days as days of the week. If you count your weekdays as days of the week and add the total number of days in the week to the total number of days a workout lasts, an answer like 100 should come up, not 200.\nOutput: If there are no workouts on the day you count then you count one day, but if there are two days, then you count two workouts. (So if you counted one you count two) You also subtract one workout in the day it lasts from the total number of days since you last worked out\nSo the final answer would include one day in the count and one workout in the count. Since the number of workouts is 100, you should have 200 days in a row. But you did not count 200 days. So your final answer is 250.\n\nInput:Where do the people who work together to build the new World Trade Center live? If their building can be used even as a shell, they can't live in their building.

An iPod is $200. So the total cost of ownership of an iPhone is $8,000. The cost of ownership of a cheap iPod for 2 years is $4,000. Thus the total cost of ownership is $3,400.  The total cost of ownership of a new iMac is $7,500. So the total cost is $9,000.  The total cost for an iPod with its battery replaced is $1,000 after the iPod service center has been discounted by 20%.  The total cost for a used iPod without its battery replaced is $150. Therefore, the total cost of ownership for an iPod is $150.  Total cost for a new iPod with its battery replaced and in good working condition is $250. Therefore the total cost of ownership in this case is $350.  The total cost to buy a new iPod with its charger and its battery replaced is $850. Therefore the total cost for the iPod is $950.  Total cost for an iPod without its battery removed is $300. Therefore the iPod is $250.  The total cost per phone is 6/7/8/9.", "answer": "B: north pole"}

The male worked all of the hours and the female worked only three of the hours.  Each of them gets a certain number of hours paid per week.  When will their weekly hours be completed?\nOutput: It must be decided which hours the men will work and which will the women work.\nSo each week the number of hours each should work depends on how the work week ends.\nSo it's possible that their weekly hours will be finished at 10:30 pm on weekdays.  Or in any other way that the number of hours can be finished on weekdays\nThat means the total number of total work hours a man and woman work is: 24=<<24=20<60>>60.\nWith that amount, the woman or man must work 2\u00bd times more.\nThat means that the total number of total hours the man (or woman) has to work times the woman or man's equal work (2\u00bd * 2\u00bd = 5.25) times the man's equal work equals 50.85 - 1.33 = 5.25 hours\nA man must work 4.5 fewer hours at a time than a woman, to obtain the same total work hours per week.\nThat means the total work hours worked are: 10 =<<10=5>>1.5 + 2.5\nSo the total time the men and women put into work at a given moment is 13.0 hours\nThat's greater than half the entire time\nSo the total time people spend at work is: 46.5/(6.0*13.0) =\n1.5 * 5.25 = 30 minutes.\nThat means people spend at least one hour at work\nThat's more than 2 hours.\nSo the time people spend at work times 2", "answer": "B: anthology"}

One player from each side scores a goal and a goal from the third team. The third goal scorer gets 1 point for each goal. A team with three players on the scoreboard will score an average of 3 points per game.\nOutput:If three teams have three players on the scoreboard, then A scored two goals, B a goal and C a goal. That would give A three points and B four points. That would be three goals by B and C combined to give B four points. Then the team with the three point average would get three points. On the other hand, if four teams had three players on the scoreboard and each one scored two goals and each one got two goals from the other teams, then A would get two points and B three points. On the same page, if three or more teams scored on one player, then that team would get two points for the goal instead of three and three points for the goal instead. Three teams with three players on the board scored 1.5 points per game. If it had taken all three teams to score a goal, then a goal for each of them would not have counted as a goal. Teams with four or more players on the scoreboard have two players on the board. Each player scores one point. Teams have five players on the board. Team A earns two points and scores two points. Teams B and C with four and five players on the scoreboard each earn three points. And teams D and E with four and five players each get four points. Each time a game is played, the players of each team who scored an equal amount of goals get one point for each goal. If three teams scored an equally equal number of goals, then any combination of the three would give each team an average of 3 points for the game. Team A scored 10 points for all 10 goals.

She finds this irritating but can't bring herself to go to the store for a new roll.  How much time does Marjorie use between the two and how long is her month?\nOutput: When we first started we used 2 pieces every 2 weeks. With more frequent trips to the toilet that number moved to 3 in 2 weeks, then it moved to 4 in 2 weeks, then to 5 in 2 weeks.  Now we use 4 pieces every 2 weeks.\nSo if she uses 3 pieces in 2 weeks, and he uses 4 in 2 weeks, his month will start in late June and will last 3 months.\nSo it took them a little over three months to go from 2 pieces a week to 4 pieces.\n\nInput:A team of 4 people sets out on a 2 day expedition to set and retrieve a single line of text.

You each get one player from each of the other two teams to play. Each team gets a pass for a 60-yard free kick. The only rules are that you have to score more than the other team. Each player starts with 5,000 points. For each team, score your points from the players that the other team gave you. When you score more, the other team scores more points. If you score more than both of your teams, you win!\nOutput: If you are the captain of the Steelers the team, you scored 25 points in the game. You scored 19 points for each player on the other team. Therefore, Pittsburgh has 3,000 points, or 30 of points from you and your teams together. Your total points are 6,400, or 3 times as much as the other teams combined.  Your total winnings are 7,400, or 3,000 times more than the remaining teams combined.\nNow for the hockey team, you gave them a pass for a 60 yard free kick and no points for their players. So they got a pass for the 60 yard free kick with 10,000 points, and scored 15 points. So they scored 7,000 points, which is 2 times as much as the teams combined. They won, and have 6,000 points. That means they had 2,000 more points than the other teams combined. Thus, that team had 1,000 more points than yours, therefore your team won.\nOutput: You scored 75 points for the Steelers team.

What happens to her if she refuses to walk to the bus stop at 10PM?\nOutput: Alice ignores friend and continues to walk home\nIt takes Alice 5 minutes to walk there. She is walking 5 miles, which is 5 miles and 25 minutes. Because the distance and time are equal, her price is $7.50/mile, which is $75/mile.  If she decided to walk home after the 10PM bus showed up at her bus stop, her average price from the previous day would have been $9.50/mile and her price for this single day would have been $78/mile.\nOutput: Since Alice ignores and continues to walk home, her average number of trips to and from the bus stop is 10/10=50/50.

So if the ball is kicked 40 yards out then the player who kicks it 40 yards out can return it 100 yards further. So it is possible to return a 100-yard ball to the start of the game if you are 50 yards further out than the ball was kicked.\nOutput: A ball is kick 50 yards. 60 yards out on a 30-yard box would have the ball travel 80 yards out. If the ball then bounces off an opponent it is possible that a player can return the ball a further distance (180 yards) than if it bounces off one of the goal posts. So if the ball was kicked 50 yards beyond the 30-yard box and then bounced off an opponent and is returned by the player, then it may reach a distance of 280 yards beyond the 30-year box.\nSo the final result is 280 + 60\n\nInput:In football the number of goals scored are equal to the number of goals conceded for each team.

{"text": "Find the amount of money spent on these items each month. You can divide this by the number of pages per month to get the total cost.\nThe paper alone would run to $20/mo, so you would need 30 pages. So you are looking at a total of $500 per month. If the computer printer costs $50/mo, and the suitcase costs $10/mo, then the total cost would be $160/mo. So you divide your $160 by 30 to get $160. So if the items cost $160/mo and they are only used 50% of the time, it would be used $80/mo. So you can divide your $80/mo by 50/60 to get $50/mo. So you pay $50/mo for the items.

We would need to save money from the increases in gas prices and the cost of filling our cars.  Let us figure this out.  So what is our saving plan?  We will need to save enough to last a week (we will need 2.5 gallons per day for that week) so we can fill our cars with gas every day.  We can save money by using the gas station that is closest to our house and also has the most gas (like the grocery store).  Or we can just fill up every day with whatever gas is available.  Since we can save $55/15 gallons it is much cheaper to fill up every day than it is to save so much money on gasoline that we fill up our car every day.  So we will need to save $11.65/25 gallons for the week.  That means saving 45 cents per day on gasoline.  Or we could save $4.60/day.  Since we will save a total of $25/day, we save $165 per week.\nOutput: We can save 45 cents a week by making do with the gas they have.\nYou got 15*50=160.

You can help him by helping him add two and subtract two numbers.  He can also draw and use the number line.  If you draw and use a number line, you get 1*2*3*4*5*6*2*5*2*2=20.  If he does not use the number line, he gets 3*2*3*3*4*4*5*3*2=25.  To figure out if he uses the number line or not, draw a square and number one, the square and number two give him 1/4.  Draw a square and number one gives him 11/4.  Draw the square and number two gives him 7/4.  Draw two squares and number two gives him 5/4.  Draw all the squares and you will always get 12.  Now do the same for all the numbers from 1 to 20.  If the numbers are all the same, there is a 50/50 chance that he used a number line.  If the numbers differ, chances are that he did not use a number line.  To figure out the number of times he used a number line, multiply the number of times he drew a square and the number two gives him 30.  If that number is 30, the final answer is 35\n\nInput:How many minutes each day will you spend on the internet while working? What would you normally spend your working time on?

And for woodland, john likes dogs who walk well, not dogs that are poorly dressed.   So each time john does not go to the pet store, he saves $5. For parking lots, he saves $1, and for woodland he saves $2.  He saves a total of $15 a week.  But he has to pay for fuel and dog shit, so by doing this he saves more, $20 a week.\nInput:The answer is E. Why is this?\nOutput:Because for E, the only places he goes are (A) and (B) so he saves $15 a week.\nFor park A, he saves $1 because he only likes dogs who walk well. For park B, he saves $6 because he likes people who dress well, who are clean and well behaved. Since the places where he does not like people are (A) and not (B), he saves $3 a week.\nInput.  For both A and B the answer is H. Why is this? Because for (A) and (H) both the places are in the woods, and both have dogs.\nOutput:The answer is A and H.  Because for A and H, both A and H are owned by dogs. For both B and C, the only places he does not like are (A) and B because he is very careful about where he goes.\nSo now we have to work out all the times he does not go.

What should the buyer do the day they pick up the car?\nOutput: The buyer should send the seller the money and wait for the rest to be received by them when they pay on August 1st.  The buyer should set a date that is convenient for the seller and the seller should make this date available on time.\nSo the buyer sends the seller the money and waits for the money to arrive.  The buyer is perfectly happy with this arrangement, and the seller is happy as well.  That means the car can be shipped with no problems.\nSo the final question is\nOutput: The price of shipping a car is equal to 2.6 times the price of buying it twice\nIn other words it is twice the price of shipping it once\nSo the final answer to this question is\n$$$2.6x$120 = $1,900\n\nInput: John has", "answer": "A: few people"}

{"text": "The current inflation will cause problems if it is ignored. There are many ways in which inflation would cause problems, some short-term and some long-term.\nFor example: The government would have to implement tax cuts, and the spending cuts that might accompany those cuts would affect wages, which would cause problems for employees, businesses, and consumers in the short-term.  It is also possible that a trade-off between government spending and increasing interest rates could be proposed, which would bring inflation under control. There are others. One example would be the decline of currency. When a nation's currency becomes less valuable, consumer confidence would be effected and the economy would slow, at least in the short-term, which would cause problems.\nOutput: It should be possible for some policies to be enacted that will not cause problems.\nOutput is\n\nInput: A factory produces a single item: a computer.

{"text": "A, B and C.\n\nInput: An average American makes an average of $30,000 over his lifetime. How much has a $30K person increased his lifetime earnings?\nOutput: The person gains $30k of lifetime earnings by retiring at 65, saving $5k every year after that, saving $40k every year after that. This person earns a total of $90k for his lifetime.\nOutput: If we take the $90k person who will retire at 65, work 1 hour a day for 40 days, invest 100% of his savings at his age and earn an average of $30/day, and then work another hour a day the next 40 days to save another $20/day and then work another hour every day until he is 65, we can save him $2k/year and earn an overall lifetime income of $100k, instead.\nOutput:\nIf we assume that the person has no financial worries, he can live comfortably for the rest of his life on this $100k income.\nBut if he has to live in a place where the economy has gone south, for example with no job prospects and no money to spend, he will certainly need to supplement his income by working another job for a month a year, and maybe another month every year to earn more than the average for his age.\nOutput:\nEven with a modestly successful financial strategy, the total amount of return on investment is still less than his lifetime returns. So he can live for a few years on only the maximum he saved and have a much smaller lifetime total return.\nOutput:\nOn the other hand, if he invested in a great business and made an investment strategy that worked well, he could make an annual average of $300k over a lifetime even with a modestly successful strategy. But that is still less money than his net worth will allow for.\nOutput:\nThus, if one is going to work more than 40 days per year to live for a while, the absolute amount of return on investment must be smaller than $100k, to live comfortably. But if one works 40 days per year to raise enough money (and still invest his profits) to take advantage of market conditions while one is still young enough to live comfortably, he may be able to make quite a bit more than the typical American, and potentially earn a lot more to a very good degree because of it.\nOutput:\nThis is a little bit different from a scenario where all", "answer": "B: magazines"}

He had never worn a shirt before because he got so many dirty looks when he would go to school wearing a shirt. But, on his first day of school the teacher told him he had to wear a shirt, because he really needed it to look like he cared to wear one.   So Jack got up early and put on his shirt.  The next time he went to class he wasn\u2019t asked why he had a shirt on.  Jack had a shirt.  On one of the days he had gone to school without it, the teacher said to the children that Jack\u2019s shirt had fallen off and was lying in a pile in the corner.

Choices:  A - 5 minute drive B - 25 minute drive C - 75 minute drive D: 1 hour drive\nOutput: 25 minute drive = 25 miles\n\nInput: If Alice decides which of these objects makes the best cup of coffee, she is to take one of them home each time.  The object that she chooses should be the one closest to her house when she arrives home.  To do this, Alice must take the object she has chosen from the cupboard, put it under her door, and put her door open ajar until she gets home.  Then, she must lock the object in her cupboard before she takes it out in case anyone is at home.  To determine the time it takes Alice to drive to the office, she must go to the office at the approximate time that she arrives home, add 1 hour to the amount of time she will need to drive, and divide the difference by the distance she would drive to her work at home.  The result of this calculation is the average amount of time it takes Alice to arrive home.  This is a simple method of calculating the time it takes someone to drive to their workplace, and is useful when driving to work with your partner, or going to watch your favorite movie.  But for this example, we are trying to calculate how many minutes it takes a person to drive to their partner's office.  If the answer is less than 8 minutes, then Alice's partner will wait an average of exactly 8 minutes for her to arrive at her office each day.

{"text": "By not allowing the heifer to live in the cow barn A, John's farm does not pay the grazing fees so that the heifer does not spend extra time in the barn. While the heifer may spend extra time in the cow barn, each day she spends in the barn pays for the additional grazing fees.  By allowing the heifer to reside in the cow barn, the heifer spends none of her time in the pasture she was grazing in (unless she goes in to relieve herself) and spends one more day in the barn. By allowing the heifer one extra day and grazing for an extra 3 cents a day, John did not spend the extra 3 cents a day on an additional day on the other two farm animals.  For each night that she spends in the barn, John does not incur a payment on grazing fees for the cows. Thus, John saves $2.50 which would have been spent on an additional day on each of the other two farm animals in the pasture.  For example, if John has 60 cows, John's payment on grazing fees was $20 and each of the 60 cows spent 3 cents a day on extra day in the pasture.\n\nInput: How many miles of wire did it take to build 2 miles of fence from the beginning to the end of the field.\nOutput: You are asked to choose the value of the miles of wire built, the time it took to build it, and the total cost of the fence.\nInput: The cattle grazed in the field for one year.

If the players conceded an equal number of goals and the total number of games scored against Aston Villa that season is 300, compute the number of goals each player conceded and compare them to the two players who scored against Aston Villa.\nOutput: If one player conceded 100 goals and the other conceded 150 and the total number of matches played against Aston Villa were 300, the two players conceded 100*150=<<150*150=160>>160 goals\nWhen the players conceded the 160 goals, one of them was in the dressing room.

Then divide the total value of the bills, $50, by 5. If you also have a $100 bill, sum up the total value of the $100 bill and divide that answer by five.\n\nInput: The value of the number two in a number of $10 bills is 1.  So what is the value of one in the five $10 bills?\nOutput: So for each of the $10 $5 bills there are 5 $1 bills and 5 $2 bills.  For each of the $10 bills there are 10 $10 bills and 10 $200 bills (if it were a $100 bill).  So for each $10 bill there are 100 $5 bills and 100 $100 bills\nThat means 100*10=280\nSo for example, if one of the $100 bills had 1000 pieces of money, so the number of $5 and $10 bills is 5500$ 10 500.  In that case, divide each $10 bill by the sum of the thousand pieces of money.\nSo for example if the 1000 pieces of money in a $100 bill was $100, then the answer is 1250.  If the 1000 pieces of money were $50, the answer is 2450.  Then the answer is 1825.  If the 1000 piece of money were $100, the answer is 18500.  So the answer is 3650.\n\nInput: Suppose you make a sale and you need to pay your accountants $200.  You have $40 in the register and $60 in the cash register.

{"text": "The average annual salary for an executive in America is $280,000 dollars. Assuming each executive can only spend $1,000 per year per vacation, then $280,000 + $280,000 = $1,800 and $880,000 = $2,100. So vacation expenses would be $1,800 per month, or $900 per year, without a savings account. The figure does not change if the executive does not spend $1,000 each year.\nInput: If Adam spends 9 months in Italy, it takes 10% of his annual salary to do all the things he wanted to do in Italy.  The same for the gym.  The same for taking a vacation.  So a year's vacation would cost $5,000 and that equals $90.60 * 9 = $9.60.\nThis means if Adam were not an executive, and if he still wanted to take a vacation on a budget so that he could afford the things he wanted to, it would cost less.

That is, a total of $3,080 is saved in 1 year's time.  So $2,000.50 is saved. The total savings for the year are $3,080.50 = $10.50 per month, or $40 per year.

If they spend $20 for the same hamburger, they will spend $28 at the gas station ($40 total) just to get the same hamburger. How should the gas company calculate the cost of the hamburger?\nOutput: Divide cost per burger into cost per pound\nSo hamburgers cost 80/10*80=<<80/10*40=$10>>40 cents\nSo hamburgers require 80 cents*2.5=$40*2.5=$60\nSo hamburgers consume 20 cents*2.5=<<20/2.5=$5 >>5 dollars.\nSo hamburgers take 80 dollars*2.5=$60*2.5=$5, or $5.50\nSo each hamburger costs $5.50\nEach hamburger costs $5, which means the gas company should cost $0.40 to deliver the hamburger ($40/2.5 x 5 = $40/20).\n\nInput: If you are a person with a small fortune, and you spend it all in one place on something you enjoy, how much time does it take to fill your tank?\nOutput: Divide the value of the fuel by the time it takes to fill\nSo the total amount of time it takes to fill the tank is $1, that means each person needs 60 minutes\nSo each tank takes 60 minutes\nSo a total 60 minutes =\n60 minutes*60 seconds =\n60 minutes X 60 seconds =\n80 minutes\nSo the final answer\n80 minutes\nIt might be worth finding and buying a gas card with the fuel you buy, and using that instead of gas.\n\nInput: What should you look for when you buy fuel.\nOutput: You should look for a vehicle with low miles and good looks\n\nInput: A person going to the movies, for instance, is expected to spend $20 per ticket.

What do you think about this?\nOutput:How would you define dishonesty or bankruptcy? Answer: If the debt was not paid, and the creditor did not honor their word, then a dishonesty or bankruptcy would occur. Answer: In other words, yes, a person would have to close the account.  Question: Was the amount of money the creditor demanded too large to handle, or did they just not honor their word? Answer: Probably not too large.  Question: Did the creditor honor their word?

In fact, they paid $60 million (in equity) to employees to replace those that quit.  John also received a $45 million bonus as well.  That means John's total compensation was $85 million over the last two years.  He also received $10 million in long term incentive stock awards.

He took the 50% cuts to keep everyone on board.\nOutput: He had to sacrifice 50% of his compensation to keep everyone from quitting.\nOutput: No one has ever earned $2 billion without cutting down on compensation.\nOutput: The people who quit get nothing back other than the $40 million they have already paid in taxes for their share of the company stock.\nOutput: Everyone in the company still earns a salary of $1, but their bonuses this year total $1, which means their total compensation is $2.  They only took out $20 from their own paychecks this year.\nOutput: The cut by John gave them $100,000 more and they still have $2 billion in compensation.\nOutput: A $2 million paycut in return for saving $200 million of capital has to be worth more than $200 million.\nOutput: If someone was willing to give $200 million into a charity, and then get $1 back, this would be worth giving", "answer": "C: learn from each other"}

{"text": "Chooses D\n\nInput:Beside all the work we do at our job, we also play football for a team called The Lions. It's a top division competition with teams from all over the country. In every game there are 2 teams. One team has 12 players and the other has 12 players. The rule is that each player can play 30 minutes each. In a 30-minute match, each player has the option of playing 60, 30, 20 or 10 minutes. The players make up their own time. The players can play anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes per game at any time of the game. The team that plays first has the whole team to themselves! If the first team wins, they are allowed to play a total of four other full-time teams as subs for the rest of the game. One other team is allowed to join the subs later in the game when the ball is over halfway in the opposing team's half. If the second team wins, their team has to wait for the time to expire before coming onto the field. If neither team wins, each side is allowed to play four minutes each. At half time the players are all told to come off to rest for the other team, but they all get back on in 5 minutes. Then they will be allowed to play another 15 minutes. The second half starts with the subs allowed to play 20 minutes each. At half the subs get on the field at their own pace, but the 2 remaining teams have 15 minutes apiece, to be played at the rate chosen by each of the teams. If either team scores more goals than the other, the goal differential between the two teams in the other team's half is multiplied by the goal differential between the teams in the other coach's half. The teams in the other coach\u2019s half always take the rest of half time to decide. The teams with the fewest goals are always relegated from the league.

Suppose he has $100,000 in a joint IRA whose earnings are taxed 25%, what is his tax rate?\nOutput: If his tax rate is =25% then his tax liability is =3,500*25%=<<3,500/>3,500\nSo his tax rate is =3/200*200 =<<3/200/>3/200 +3/200*>>>3/200+>>>3/200 =\n\nOutput: Suppose Steve and Elizabeth both earn at $100,000 a years. Every year, they pay taxes: $75 each, since $75/9 = $72.  Steve has a tax liability of $3,500; Elizabeth has no liability since she pays no taxes. With a tax rate of $72 a year, Steve pays an income tax of $3,500. (If tax rates were to be raised to $180, Steve would pay $4,500. The same would be true for Elizabeth. The tax rate for them remains at $75.)\n\nInput:For the last 2.5 years, Steve has paid taxes of $800 each. Now what is the value of his tax liability?\nOutput: Taxable income will be $200,000, since it amounts to $800 a year. The value of his tax liability is $800\n\nInput:1,2,3,4 are integers.

How will the work on the box take place before and after delivery?\nOutput: Because this person wanted it delivered he bought it.\nThat means he bought an unboxed computer desk worth $1,500.  At some point he will need to put it together and put it back together.  He also needs to box it so he can return it with the box intact.  He also needs a box to send it back to the manufacturer.  Before the box is sent to him he will need to pack it.  After the box is sent to his house he will need to pack his computer desk.  Then he will need to ship it off.\nThe work on the computer desk will likely occur over 2-3 months. So he will pay $240*3=<240*3=120>120 dollars for the time it takes to do it.  At that time the computer desk is worth around $200.  That means it was delivered for $120 and will probably be lost in the mail.\nThe work to put the computer desk together and put the box together will probably take 2-3 months.

Would you estimate that Jack needs to spend $1,600 in a month to keep his two clients happy?\nOutput: Assuming that Jack's two clients spend $600 a month, the $1,600 he spends in a month is 1/2 the cost of the AC for two of them.\nSo the final output is $600 less than what the company makes.\n\nInput:Jack decides he wants to try something new and spend $5,000 on a company that makes electric scooters. He wants to test the scooters out before he buys them.  How much of an estimate do you think he would make?\nOutput: Jack wants to buy $5,000 worth of scooters. The cost of the scooters for test driving is only $1,600. Therefore, he needs $1,600 * $1,600 = $600.\nSo he needs $1,200 * $1,600 * 60=$3,600\nSo the final answer will be $300\n\nInput: The average hourly wage in America was $8.87 in the 1990s.

{"text": "This is a game of skill. Choices, not of song. The band plays three songs. Choose A, B, or D.\n\nInput:For a family with 4 children, the average home price in the US is $140,000.  If the family bought a house with $100,000, the annual rental money must be $7,000.  The monthly payment must also be $7,000, assuming the family keeps it's current rent.  Multiply $7,000 by 4 children per month= $100,000.  Subtract $10,000/4 children = $44,000 per family each and every year for the next 10 years.  Divide $44,000 by 10 years = $80,000.  Multiply 80 by 10= $1.8Million per year at a low interest rate, the total income is $8,865,000.  You then subtract the number of people in the family, and multiply by 5.  The total income of the family is $85,765,000.  The rental income must now be $7,500 for the next 5 years at an 8% annual return rate.  Divide $8,865/5= $2,400/year, then add $400 to the annual total income the following year and the next.  If you multiply $2,400 by 5 years, for the next 5 years your family will have an annual income of $7,800,000.  Divide $888,000/5 years= $2,500/year in rental income.  The rental income the following year must be $2,500.  In the end, this family with $80,000 in income earns $8Million each year, the rental income is $8Million, and $80,000/5 years pays $2,500/annually for the next 5 years.  The family keeps the house, and rents out another $2Million of income for $3,000-$8,000 in income each year for the next 5 years to add $3Million to their income from real estate. The rental income each year must be $3,200,000.  Add in the interest $200,000 per year, and now your annual income is $7,400,000.

That means the store pays the worker 50% less for his fruit than it used to.  What does this mean for the store?  What does it say about the worker?\nOutput: How much does the strawberry cost when the worker is paid $2.50 a day for his fruit?  It costs 70 cents to pay the worker $50 instead of 50 cents.\nThat means the worker gives the store $20 back each week instead of $20 per week.  That, in turn, lowers the average cost to the store per unit food and labor.\nSo the final total price per strawberry to the store per week is 30*70=$<<30*70=240>>240 per week.\nThat means the price of strawberry is $30\n\nInput: In order to keep the total price of the food item below $5 per meal that a worker receives for his produce, the total number of pounds of the fruit must be $2 each, or $0.85.  What is the total number of pounds that a worker is paid per meal for his fruit?  How many half cents does the worker have each day?  Calculate the total number of $0.85 divided by the number of $0.70 each. Divide by 3.\nOutput: As a percentage of the total price of fruit, the worker receives 50% less total weekly price.  Therefore his total weekly price is $5=$<<<<5+3=$140>>140 per week.\nThat takes the total cost per $0.85 down to 20 cents, so the total price is $5.15\nThat means the price per unit food of", "answer": "B: buy"}

If you roll it in your hand and then release it onto the table, do the centimeter at the top of the ball roll farther out than the bottom centimeter?\nOutput: The centimeter at the top will roll farther than the centimeter at the bottom.\nThe centimeter at the top is 4.0*1026=5.0. The centimeter at the bottom is 4.0*102=5.0.\nTherefore, the centimeter at the upper centimeter will roll farther out than the centimeter at upper (lower) centimeter (but not the lower centimeter).\nSo in total the amount of distance from the centre of the bowling ball to the table will be 5.0*102*4.0=15.0. In other words the ball will be in the air for 15 timezones\nTherefore the final answer is 15\n\nInput and Output:\nInput:The weight of a ball is a square centimetre. If you roll it into your hand and then release a ball, the centimetre at the top will roll further out than the centimetre at bottom?\nInput:The weight is 4.0*103 x 1010 = 104.0\nOutput:The weight of a centimetre is 4.0*108*1010 = 10.0.\nSo in total the weight is 105.0*104.0*105.0 = 106.0\nTherefore it cannot roll farther than the centimetre. Therefore it is impossible to roll up to the top. Therefore it is impossible that it roll up to the bottom\n\nInput:How many calories are in a typical banana?\nOutput:The calorie of a banana depends upon the ripe banana:\n\nInput:The number of watermelons in a crate equals 100 kilolitres.

It comes about because in general, a company will misrepresent the condition of a product in order to make money. An example of a claim is that the company had an inordinate amount of expenses and had bad performance in some area. The lawsuit says that it is false because the company did not claim these expenses and had really bad performance in another area.\nB: Wrongful Termination\nFalse claims also include claims of wrongful termination. In legal terminology, a wrongful termination action is a lawsuit in which a company wrongfully terminates a customer. It is normally brought by the buyer. A buyer's right to terminate a sale is protected by Federal and State law. False claims are usually made to recover the company's legal defense of termination.\nC: Unfavorable Disclosure and Arbitration\nFalse Claims often involve conflicts of interest because the buyer is trying to force a company to pay it a \"fair\" price. For a consumer, this can mean a \"free\" product. False Claims are usually brought by an agency, typically an association of lawyers.

If a bear eats 40 pounds of food a day, the animal consumes 60 less pounds the next day, and then only 60 pounds the day after that.  The more animals there are on the planet the less food there is for each animal, hence the reason why the animal goes hungry.  What factors would account for these effects?\nOutput: The less animals there are on the earth the more food there is for all animals.

The topmost row from each \"prime\" row is the column to be turned.  When the last \"prime\" row is turned, the next prime row is the next column.  Therefore, the order of turning each column is the same as that of turning each row.  That is why the first row on the bottom of each column corresponds to the topmost right turn.  The next row down is a \"prime\" row; the next one is the second prime row.  The columns are then turned to \"prime\" rows again, and so on.  The last row on each column is the \"prime\" column before turning that column.  Each \"prime\" row is only turned once however.  Therefore, the first row on the \"prime\" row of the last column (the leftmost column) corresponds to the first turn on that column.  That is why every \"prime\" row of every column must be turned to a second prime row.  Therefore, the columns are turned to the second \"prime\" column on the left side, while the \"prime\" column of the topmost column is turned to the \"prime\" row on the left side.\nOutput: That is the correct answer\n\nInput:The car was built in 1957.

If only two or one goals are scored,  each goal is worth 5.  If both goals are scored, each goal is worth 10.   Assume that this is a season long league. Assume that all team members contribute to league goals as well. Assume that a season long league has 60 games. Let P be the number of goals scored by each team in this league. Suppose that team P does not have any goals this season.  Consider the following situation:  Assume that there are no other teams currently in league with any team, but team P is now part of league.  If P were part of the league, then each team will now have one goal scored against.  Therefore, the total number of goals for the season is 60. Assume that in the previous 80 games, team B had 35 goals, team A had 45 goals, team C had 80 goals, and team D had 120 goals. Assume that team B and team D have a total of 15 goals against each this season. This season, both team B and team D will have 60 goals against.  Assume that both team B and team C only scored 1 goal this season.  Then, let B=60 + C=5 =60 + D=30.  If the total goal total for this league is 600, then team B will have scored 60 goals against total 200 goals.  Similarly, if team D only scored 1 goal this year, then D will have scored 1 goal against the total 200 goals by team C.  This season, a team that has contributed only 55 goals will contribute 55 goals against. Suppose that only team C scoring 20 goals is bad for the league.  It is better for this team to contribute 50 goals against. Suppose that a team scoring 45 goals is a disaster for the entire league.  It is far better for this team to not contribute anymore. Suppose that there are 40 goals scored against by each team during this season.  Suppose that only 35 goals are scored against another team total of 45 goals.

A tennis player at his best years has won 200/7=2.8 times more matches than one at his beginning.\nSo the final result is that a player playing at the end of his very best year would have won over 40 times as many matches as one starting that year\nIn the example.

You go to the beach with your family for the 3rd straight day.  By going to the beach, you increase your chances of catching a swine flu, from \"about 100% chance to about 98.6%\"  Also, you increase your chance of getting a heart attack, from \"about 100 percent chance to about 93.5%\"  You also increase the chance of having a stroke, from \"about 100-percent chance to about 98.2%\"  Of the total, do you consider that these risks are worse than simply not going to the beach?  Or do you consider that the increased risk of all those risks is worth the 100-percent increased chance of catching a swine-flu? (or alternatively, that you are just fine with the increase!)\n\nOutput: The risk of catching swine flu does NOT mean losing the ability to breathe.  That's a positive.  Your heart does not need the exercise.  It doesn't have to go anywhere, and it doesn't have to be exercised.  So you do take the higher risks and do not have the 100-percent risk.  The net effect is that the net effect is that you are, in fact, better off not going to the beach for a while.  To be the most logical, this means that the risk of catching swine-flu is \"about 50-percent chance to less than 100-percent chance\" rather than being \"about 100-percent risk without the 100-percent benefit.\"\n\ninput: Adam was walking along one afternoon toward his house when he notices there are a lot of weeds growing on the sidewalk.

{"text": "The number of unusual varieties of roses that are available depends on your area.  The type of rose available will probably match the type that you desire.  Your area should be the first factor you use.  The second factor would be the area you live in.  The third factor would be the type of rose you prefer.  The last factor would be the number of rose plants you need.\nOutput: If there is a variety of roses readily available in both your area and your desire, you probably need to find out whether or not your area has a garden center in the area.  That should tell you what type of rose is readily available in both the garden center and your desire.\nOutput: The garden center will be your second factor.  They should carry every variety of rose in their department, plus some unusual varieties.  The third and final factor you need is the number of rose plants that would be necessary to make the types of roses you desire.  If your area is fairly small, you probably should focus on that.\nOutput: If all three of the factors above come together, you may need to focus on finding out the location of the Garden Center before you can purchase any sort of rose.  But since your area should be the first priority, you probably only need to be looking if you absolutely have to get one type of rose.  In such cases you may be interested in seeing whether the local plant is a kind of unusual breed of rose.  If that is the case, it is probably a good idea to buy a pack of those for your garden center if you do not already have a large collection of other kinds of roses.\nOutput: One way to tell what type of rose you are likely to find locally is by asking for one.  It will not be unusual for the manager to point you in the direction of the rose they carry.  That will also be a good way to pick some very interesting varieties.\nOutput: If none of the factors give you any rose you desire at all, just choose the nearest rose garden you can locate.  The last thing to do is to ask them if they have any unusual breeds of roses they might be selling.  Those usually come from outside, so this is a very good way to find roses that you can also plant in the same garden you wish to have, which would make it much more of a home garden.

{"text": "Ficus plants are often placed under the desk or in the entryway of an office at middle east, or next to or in the kitchen at palace or apartment.  They typically have a low profile that is not noticeable.\nThat means the total number of work spaces where ficus plants are placed is 3.  Therefore, an office with three ficus plants gives an effective utilization of 3/3 for the ficus plants in the space.  If a palace was to require the use of 3 of those spaces, the total additional space occupied by ficus plants would be 9%.  At apartment and dictionary this would be a very poor utilization of space.  If the total number of people working for an apartment or dictionary at any given time is 150, that means there is at least another 150 people out working that space.  Adding more ficus plants to that space would only increase the utilization rate of that space from 5% up to 10%.  In office that number would be approximately 20%.

So it becomes cow country\n\n Input: It has been decided that the country can handle a three year period of economic stagnation and unemployment is expected to go up.  The government will need to find a new way to pay for infrastructure projects.  One possibility is to issue treasury bonds that interest can be collected on when their payments are overdue.  Does this idea pass the test?  The government will have to issue 400 billion treasury bonds and the interest payment will have to be $500 million a month or about $40 billion a year. How much will this cost?  Output: The government will have to print 400 billion treasury bonds in three years.  The interest cost will be $400 billion a year, thus it will cost $4000 million a month.  That is $8000 million a year, so on average $40 billion a year will be required for the interest that government will have to pay.\nOutput: On average $40 billion a month will be collected on interest.\nSo on average $40 billion will be collected on interest a month.\nSo the final output is $40 billion\n\nInput: The country spends about $100 billion a year on building roads, bridges, etc.  The government has a plan to cut the deficit.  First, they will sell the remaining stock of bonds that they used to pay for the roadbuilding.  They will also start issuing treasury bonds to make up the difference between the budget deficit that remains in place, and the budget deficit that will be covered.  So does this proposal meet the test of being acceptable?\nOutput: The deficit will decrease because the remaining stock of treasury bonds is sold.

That means the total cost will be $100 + $5 = $55\nIf we multiply it further by 5, we get 2* 5 = 10.  That is, $100 + $5 x 10 = $500\nIf we multiply it again by 10, we get 6* 10 = 12.  That is, if we find any more hotels on the trip, the cost will be $12.  So the total cost will be\n3 * 12.5 = 15.5 >>15.5 = 35.5\nSo the final answer for the question is 35\n\nInput:You are born in America in 1939.

The average Italian has a salary of $22,000. If half these Italians earn $22,000 a year, how many earn $30,000 per year?\nOutput: 12\n\nInput: There were 10 million people with a total average income of $34,000 in 1990. Given the total number of people in 1990 in each city, how many people earned $34,000 per year? Determine the average net income of each city\nOutput: $34,000 x 10 million = $34,000,000\nOutput: $34 = $34,000\nOutput: N = 10,000 x $34\nThat makes $1,350,000 available for taxes over 10 years.\nSo the average net income of all of Italy in 1990 was $34.\nThat means it would be wise to avoid spending on such things as health care, education and transportation. If there were 10 $34,000 incomes, then a portion of each of them must have been earned by people who earned $40,000. If so, the $1,350,500 in that city could be spent on healthcare, education and transportation.\nOutput: 10,000 x $40,000*$34,000)= $350,500/10,000\nOutput: 10*50,000 = $350,500\nOutput: 10=50,000\nOutput: Total\nIn total 30,000 people earned $50,000 a year.\nOutput: $50,000 x $50,000/10,000 = $350.5 million (1 million $50K income)\nOutput: 30 = $30*$350/100,000\nThat gives $1,150,000\n\nInput: At the beginning of 2002 one million immigrants entered the United States.

What are the two biggest increases between 2002 and 2008?  Answer: *$2,000 to $2,250*2/4*12,000 = $2,000  *$3,500 to $22,750*2/8*12,000 = [2,500 * 2,250/6,000 = $34,750  that is 50% inflation.  This gives the difference between 2002 and 2008 as $2,000]  $4,000 to $27,000  $6,000 to $31,250  $9,000 to $35,000  $12,000 to $30,750.  So total change is $11,550.  Note:  the changes occurred over several cycles.  There are no data over the 10 year period from 1988 to 1998.  The changes occurred over a longer period of time.  Because the average person\u2019s earnings dropped, it caused people\u2019s purchasing power to drop.\nOutput: *$17,875  *$17,750 * $12,250 = $5,825*5/18*5,825 = $8,875*8/18*10,825 = $16,875*16/18*16,875 = [21,825]\n\nInput: You have two different people that are willing to fly from A to B for just $200 each.

How much will the inspection add to the price of the car?\nOutput: If the oil inspection adds $15.00 to the price of the vehicle, you can deduct the additional $25.00 to get a car worth $2000.00\nSo the final answer will be $2000.00-$2500\n\nInput:The total price of two items sold by two dealers is $3500.00.

If no goal is scored in the game, the goalkeeper will kick a free kick towards the goal and his goalkeeper will try to catch it\nIf the goalkeeper catches the ball there the goalkeeper must not give it back to the opposing team.\n\nInput:Suppose your job took you several hours, but it requires that you start early in the morning and end sometime around 4:30, but if you worked from home, you wouldn't do this schedule.   If an employer offered to work from home, should you do it?  If the employer offered to pay you half of your salary to work from home, would you do it?  The difference between this schedule and your current schedule is:  1) It eliminates waking up late, 2) It saves you from making personal phone calls, 3) You have to be home at a certain time, and 4) You are working at the same time each day.\n\nOutput: Work from home, if offered in this instance, would be the best schedule.\n\nInput: A person has several kids.

You must have 5 for 2 cards and 3 for 3 cards. The number 6 will then be 4 or 3. So you would have 6 or 3. Not 4 or 3. And if you answer B, then it looks like the drugstore is correct. It looks like a pharmacy correct, and a McDonald's correct. But the answer for that question would be 2 or 3, not 6 or 3, so it is not correct.

{"text": "The best answer is the one that shows a football stadium moving\n\nInput: The average value of the daily number of hours of sleeping each day was 4.72 hours.  The average number of hours for both men and women is 9-10.  The average is also 5.88 for children and 9.88 for parents.  The average number for children and parents is 10-11.  The average number is 6-7.  The average number can be increased by getting the night owl to go to bed earlier and going to bed a couple hundred minutes earlier.  The average number should be 9.88 hours.\nOutput: Assuming that the average value for an adult is 9-10 hours of sleep, then the number of hours people look at things is the day-night difference divided by 24 equals to 9, and 2 divided by 24 equal to 30\nTherefore, the answer is 6, the same as the initial answer\n\nInput: The following questions may be used to compare the answers you gave to the previous questions:  I would take away the last value from each, and then use an equation to tell me what the average value of daily activity is\nOutput:\na. The average number of hours of daily activity would be 9.88 hours\nb. For children, the average number would be 7.5 hours\nc. For parents, the average number would also be 7.5 hours.\nd. For children, 2 hours is also 2\ne. 24 divided by 30 equals 30\nf. 20 is 100, then 50 is 300, then 50 is 2400\ng. 100 divided by 2400 equals to 5400.\nh. If you add a day to the end of every year, the average increases by a day, so the average daily number of hours is 976.5, for example 974.5, 856.5, etc. There are 24 hours in a day so there are 2400 hours per year. The reason behind this is that if you divide the first day by the first day of January, the result is 875, adding a day to the end results to 876 instead of 876.5\n\nInput: If you had two options for purchasing 20 bananas which would you choose?\nOutput: Buying bananas from a store gives you 20 kg of bananas for a little bit of money.

His total check is $9,000.  How much does is pay per day on gas?  Output:  He does not have any pay checks.  So his check comes once a week.  His total pay check is $9,160.  How much is his check before taxes?  Output:  James pays 35% taxes on his check as it comes and the rest goes in his checking account.  So his total check is $3,720 from his job every week.  He pays no taxes on his bonus.  He gets $10,000 when he is paid $360 a week.  So his average weekly check from his job is $35.84.  The average weekly check he gets is $36.84/36=$360+$10,000=$360.

At most, there will be a single point with two boats which will get stuck.  Then only 2/3 of the boats will leave the lake and the third will have to be pulled up.  That's why 1/3 of the boats won't leave the lake.  So the real outcome is that there will only be two boats stuck in the center of Lake Ontario.  So the final answer is none of the above\n\ninput:There are 10 million people in America.  Each person has a gun.  Two of those guns are automatic for a semi-automatic and a fully automatic.

How many other teams did the New York Red Bulls beat during the season?\nOutput: The number of matches won by the New York Red Bulls increased from 5 to 10 during the season so that their total number of matches won increased from 20 to 30.\nFor this to be true then the New York Red Bulls have to have played and lost 10 times against 5 other teams during the year, including 2 of the 5 other teams they beat during the year.  These 5 other teams are therefore counted as non-major league teams for this analysis.  That does mean that the New York Red Bulls only won 5 matches during the full season, as you would expect if they were just playing other Major League Soccer teams.\nOutput: The total number of matches won by each team during the season is 4.10x30/20=40 matches.\nSo the total number of matches won in the entire year by the New York Red Bull team was 30.3.\nThat means the final answer is 40\nNOTE: The New York Red Bulls also played in the US Open Cup, and this is counted towards the Major League Soccer totals\n\nInput: The price of a gallon of gasoline in the country of Germany jumped from $2.59 in 1992 to $5.24 in 1996.

Student numbers in third row are 3 and 2.  Student numbers in bottom row are 1 and 0.  So each student has two numbers on their key board.  When they start to play a key, the student knows their number and their key and can play that key at the right moment.\nInput: On the right panel beside a student key there is a student number of about 9.  On the left panel beside a student key, there is an equal number of student numbers of about 1.\nOutput: The student number on the left panel appears twice.  So the student number on the right panel appears four times more than twice as many times as the one on the left panel.  So each student number has three keys on their key board, instead of the two keys the normal way.\nThat means on the left panel, there is a total of three student numbers on the left, and the three different student numbers on the right only have two keys.\nInput:There are 11 red balls and 13 black balls in the game.

Therefore the sun appears lower in the sky than it does in the summertime.  Therefore on days in which the sun's rays are not brightly shining, the sky looks brighter.  Therefore Mary looked out of that window on Sunday's with more blue in her eyes than on other days of the week.  This can be used to predict a day coming up before the sun.  It can also be used to guess a day's position on the calendar.  Using this information, how many calendar days does it take Mary to predict June 17th?  Input: July 1 = 4. In July, a new moon will occur on June 27th. Because the moon is just outside of the shadow of Earth, it will be dark as it rises. In a few weeks it will be very light. July will end with 23 days remaining in it. Mary, how long will it take it to reach August 25th and the next full moon? Input: September 17 = 5. In September, a new moon will come on September 18th.

If you run it, do you estimate that you can stop it in time to avoid hitting it?\nOutput: If you switch cars and run them off the road, you estimate that it will be about 3/4 of the way to hitting it by the time they stop, the slowest one.  You estimate that they will hit it before they get the speed to stop before it hits.  You estimate that it will take about 9/10ths of the time to stop if you ran it from stop.\nSo the final output is 9/10ths of a trip.\nIf you get out of the fast car and slow the other down, do you speed up or slow down the next car?\nYour answer will depend on your situation.\n\nInput: When you are eating, you want to fill up half of your stomach with raw vegetables, half with cooked vegetables, and the rest with something.

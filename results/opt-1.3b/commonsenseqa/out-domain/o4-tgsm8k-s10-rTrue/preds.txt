The answer is A or B.<n>output: At a pound of cheese, you get 2 cheeses. You get A when you purchase the pound. And you get B whenever you purchase another pound. So you will get 2 cheese prices when purchasing 1 pound. However, you will only get 1 cheese price when purchasing 2 pounds. It is possible that A was purchased first, resulting in just 1 cheese price. As such, you can determine answer A by subtracting the 1 cheese price from the 2 cheese price and determining B by subtracting the 1.5 cheese price from the 2.5 cheese price.

Given supply, how is that supply related to demand? Output: The price is related to supply when supply is short and demand is high. In fact, if supply is high this means that demand is high and when supply is short this means that supply is low. So the price is related to supply of food and demand of food. If supply was long, the short supply would give the price higher. The inverse would usually be true for demand.<n><n>Input:What is the total length of the universe? Input:The universe has 10^30 seconds of length. Calculate how many seconds in 10^30 there are in the time unit measure of a day. Output:The length of the observable universe (10^30 of length) is about 0.000000038 seconds. Therefore ten^30 seconds in 10^30 is the age of the universe. Because 10^30 seconds is about how long the observed universe has been observable, it appears that the age of the universe must be 10^30. However, the true age of the universe is not 10*30 or 10^30, but about 10^14. However, the actual age of the universe is only about 10^28. However since 10^28 is a natural number, it is not an observable number. Therefore when you ask a question about length, ask about age using a natural number.<n><n>Input: What happens to a dog that tries to leave a home? How long do the dogs stay inside the home if the dog leaves?<n>Output: If the dog attempts to run from the owners house then they will chase and catch the dog. If the dog attempts to remain in the house then the dogs owner will allow the dog inside the house. Therefore if the dog leaves to go on a walk, then the owners will let the dogs stay inside the house.

He ignored him, and decided to ignore the others, too. As he did, he kept a careful eye on the crowd around him. At one point, a group of five young men walked past his path. They were speaking through their cellphones. He asked for their cellphones numbers, and they agreed to meet him later in the terminal. Two of the men were friendly, the other two were very aggressive. The first guy made sure to approach John in a threatening manner. He was threatening to rape John's wife. The guy who was threatening to rape would only show his face during sex. The other guy said that since John had refused to speak to them, he should beat him up and rape him instead. He would then use John's wife's body as a shield during the assault. After the fight, the attacker was going to take John's wallet. He said that he would beat the living daylights out of him, and that he would use his wife's corpse as a weapon to kill any would-be intruders. As he was leaving, he noticed that the first guy was leaving with a group of his friends.  He took a chance and picked up the two of them at the airport. When they got to the hotel, the guys offered to give him a ride, since he was carrying so much luggage. John agreed, but only for a small portion of the ride. When they got there, he found out that two guys were already in the vehicle, waiting for him to leave. During the ride, he was sitting with his wife, when the other guy walked in the back of the car. He asked about the women he had been with for the past two years. The younger guy said that he wanted her, and she was happy, too, with another man. The older guy denied that her man was interested in her, but only after having had sex with her. The guy then became angry at his wife, saying that she had been unfaithful, to which John agreed to go home with the younger guy. Two guys from the tour who came with the two men later brought him back to the scene of the fight. After he was alone, he decided to check out the men who had beaten him.  They were all sitting together at the bar he frequented. He got up and left because his wife was still not home

Choices:  A: insubstantial B: massless C: dwarf D: inconsequential E: good<n>Output:		The sum of a building's mass is equal to its total height.  If the building is constructed from thin plates, the total height is equal to the sum of the thicknesses (thickness of the plates).  If the building is in fact constructed from thick plates and has a long straight section, the sum of the building's height is equal to the thickness times the distance from the wall to the ceiling times the distance along the wall to the ceiling.<n>Output:If the building is constructed from very heavy plates and is therefore very substantial (i.e. has much mass), the mass of the building's center at the point of greatest tension is of the order of the magnitude of the thickness.  If the building's length is equal to the sum total of the lengths of all the plates (i.e. the plates become thick and also shortens the building's length for simplicity) then the sum of the lengths of all of the plates is of the order the magnitude of the building's length.<n>Output:If it were possible to predict the sum of the mass of the entire building from what you can say about its width and height, then we could calculate the total mass (the sum of the center mass of "all the plates") of a building.<n>Output:If there were no externalities we would be able to calculate the overall mass of a building by knowing at least the sum total of the sum total of the cross section of the building's wall plus the length of its floor plus the thickness of its panels.

I used an "un" when counting how many people Adam said he knows and was correct.<n>So "3" is correct<n><n>In Italian, "un" is one and an "un" is also two. So, in Italian, "un" equals one when counting how many people. And, "un" equals two when giving an answer for how many people.<n>So "3!" is correct in both the sentence and the answer when "un" is used as a count in one of these questions:<n><n>In the last two sentences, where you count 3 and give "un", you use the "un" in the sentence to tell us the count in the answer. But in both sentences the "un" is different.  So "2" and "3" are not correct.<n>The "un" in "2" changes the answer, though.  So, "3!" is correct.<n><n>**For accuracy, I will note that you did not use an "un" when you give the same answer in English!**  My example in this answer also shows two "un" for each person in the sentence<n><n>**For this example.

Thus my ability to have fluent or "good" speech, fluent or "good" Chinese, fluent or "good"-speaking knowledge of Spanish, Spanish's specific sounds and phrases for languages, etc... are all unique and unique.<n>Thus my overall ability to do what people often mistake for a single ability, but actually are many individual abilities, is unique.<n>Thus my ability of speaking a universal language (Spanish) is unique.<n>Thus being bilingual and being unique are not mutually exclusive.<n>Thus it is false to say that only being bilingual is rare.<n>Thus the answer is false<n><n>Input: If I walk from A to B at a given speed and in a given direction, and I average a speed of 2 meters per second over the distance, what distance will I arrive at B with two seconds left in the clock? Output: If I walked twice for the same distance at the rate of 2 meters per second across the distance, I would arrive at B with 2.7 seconds left in the clock. Thus 2.7 x 2 = 6.75 seconds.<n>Thus we arrive at 6.75 x 3.225 = 11.25 seconds. The speed I walk at may well affect the total time I spend at B.<n>Since we do arrive at B in the span of 11.25 seconds, the question is moot, as the answer is not 11.25 seconds but 11.25 * 2.75 = 5.75 seconds.<n>So the final number is 11.25 * 5.75 = 6.25<n><n>Input:A woman visits the doctor twice a week for an 8-minute appointment.

But as he got up to go to the bathroom he couldn't help but notice some very odd things. His skin was all dry and cracked, and his nipples were very hard, it was obvious they had been hard since

So 40.5% of households earned less than $47,000 per year, 10% earned less than $16,500 per year, and 90% earned less than $24,000 per year.  So these are average household incomes for the USA..<n>Output: Total households 60,300. The ratio was 60/35--40.5% of households lived in households with incomes between $30,000 and $51,000, 10% lived in households of $30,000 to $51,000, and 30% lived<n>in households of $50,000 or more.<n>At the same the ratio was 25/70.

Assuming 30,000 stores, there are 3,300 stores in the US (not including any additional locations built for new stores).  If I were to add any additional locations, the effective retail space available for new stores would total 4,120,040,000 square feet.  I plan on building a new store in New York.  The number of potential customers in the US is 13 billion.  Assuming a new store in New york costs $2.5 million per year, building another store will cost $700 million.  Thus adding 5 new stores would give me a total capital cost of $1,050 million.  Since I have already spent $700 million on my store in NY, another $500 million would give me a total cost of $1,400 million.  So I will build yet another store in the new US   A + (B + C + D - E)   *1,400/2 => 14,900,000 x 0.2 = $16,900,000  Since the average person has only $1000 saved for a year, the maximum number of potential customers I could realistically serve costs me $16,900,  which is only 1/10th of the total potential customers I currently serve...<n>Input: If I want to maximize my net income, which account should I open first?

How long did it take you to save up the $2500?<n>Output:You only saved up $2500 in the account so you only earned $2500 in interest over the 8 years.  What was the time it took you to save up the balance to earn $2500?<n>Output D: You earned $2500 in interest because the interest rate was 3.5%<n>Output E: The $2500 was from $1000 in the account, and of the $4000 loan on the car you only paid $250 back over the 8 years<n>Output F: The $2500 was interest you paid on the car<n>Output S: The interest you pay on the house is more than the original loan on the car<n>Output: Your mortgage payment (house payment) is $400 per month.  How long did you pay off your first mortgage in total?<n>Output:The interest you earned from your $1000 in savings accounts is equal to $250.

So at $300/day, the average investor makes $8100, that's $900 a day, 3 days a week. Over 200 days a year in the US market there are 5.5 trillion dollars worth of stock traded. Each of these days is worth $1200. Suppose that instead of the stock market you used another asset that does not fluctuate. The most common asset used is money. What would the average money account make in a year?<n><n>Input: The United States Census Bureau will keep tabulations of the value of stock assets held in the country, and that asset is the stock market. What's the highest percentage of all stock assets owned by an individual?<n>Output: It's a very interesting topic, although probably hard to answer accurately. A lot of people with stock investments have "stockbroker" stocks (which are shares in some company) and "passive" holdings (which are investments that are not active in the company being bought or sold in). For example, one could make $2,000 by investing

When will their weekly hours be completed?<n>Output: It must be decided which hours the men will work and which will the women work.<n>So each week the number of hours each should work depends on how the work week ends.<n>So it's possible that their weekly hours will be finished at 10:30 pm on weekdays.  Or in any other way that the number of hours can be finished on weekdays<n>That means the total number of total work hours a man and woman work is: 24=<<24=20<60>>60.<n>With that amount, the woman or man must work 2½ times more.<n>That means that the total number of total hours the man (or woman) has to work times the woman or man's equal work (2½ * 2½ = 5.25) times the man's equal work equals 50.85 - 1.33 = 5.25 hours<n>A man must work 4.5 fewer hours at a time than a woman, to obtain the same total work hours per week.<n>That means the total work hours worked are: 10 =<<10=5>>1.5 + 2.5<n>So the total time the men and women put into work at a given moment is 13.0 hours<n>That's greater than half the entire time<n>So the total time people spend at work is: 46.5/(6.0*13.0) =<n>1.5 * 5.25 = 30 minutes.<n>That means people spend at least one hour at work<n>That's more than 2 hours.<n>So the time people spend at work times 2

One player from each side scores a goal and a goal from the third team. The third goal scorer gets 1 point for each goal. A team with three players on the scoreboard will score an average of 3 points per game.<n>Output:If three teams have three players on the scoreboard, then A scored two goals, B a goal and C a goal. That would give A three points and B four points. That would be three goals by B and C combined to give B four points. Then the team with the three point average would get three points. On the other hand, if four teams had three players on the scoreboard and each one scored two goals and each one got two goals from the other teams, then A would get two points and B three points. On the same page, if three or more teams scored on one player, then that team would get two points for the goal instead of three and three points for the goal instead. Three teams with three players on the board scored 1.5 points per game. If it had taken all three teams to score a goal, then a goal for each of them would not have counted as a goal. Teams with four or more players on the scoreboard have two players on the board. Each player scores one point. Teams have five players on the board. Team A earns two points and scores two points. Teams B and C with four and five players on the scoreboard each earn three points. And teams D and E with four and five players each get four points. Each time a game is played, the players of each team who scored an equal amount of goals get one point for each goal. If three teams scored an equally equal number of goals, then any combination of the three would give each team an average of 3 points for the game. Team A scored 10 points for all 10 goals. On the other hand a team with four players on the scoreboard would start with only 5 points, and two points for each additional player scored.<n><n>Input:A man is eating a steak, potatoes and peas.

Choices:  A: build family together B: fall in love C: make love D: complete E: distance themselves<n>Output:		 If a lover is not likely to fulfill all of the listed options C, D, and E, they probably should break up with her because of the risk of falling in love or having children together:<n>R = 2^(1 - A/100) * E<n>R=2^(2 - A/100) = (A + B/100)^(2 + C/100) + (E + D/100).<n>So R is a good approximation to C<n>R = 200/100 x E^A/100 = 200*10^25 = 2,000<n>So the final answer here is 2,000 or 2,000,000<n><n>Input:You only get six months with your lover in your life, in which case, you can only have sex a couple of times every six months. You have sex about six times a year.  What is the likelihood that at least one sexual encounter results in a pregnancy?<n>Output:  That depends on whether your lover will get pregnant or not. If she does, that is very unlikely, because you only ever have sex six times a year. But if you will get pregnant, that is extremely likely.<n>Input:  For the next six months, you can only have one sexual encounter with any lover.  That lover will either be male or female. Do you sleep with one more lover to give yourself more than six months of time?<n>Output: You can only have two sexual encounters with any lover for the next six months, because you would get pregnant if both of them get pregnant<n>So the actual answer to your question is 1<n><n>Input: A man and a woman go out for a night on the town.  Once they leave the house, a robber enters through an unlocked door while they were gone.   The man tries to shoot him dead as he runs by, but instead he runs by and kills the robber. The robber then runs away, and the two go into a bar. She takes a look around at the bartender and says she has never seen a man die like this - if this happens again, she will give him the name of the bar so he can call 911.  The bartender says, “It must be a bar on the wrong side of town”.<n>Output: The robbery is the same every time: if a man and a woman are walking down the street, and a man attempts to rob them, they will run away, and will never find evidence of the robbery.

You each get one player from each of the other two teams to play. Each team gets a pass for a 60-yard free kick. The only rules are that you have to score more than the other team. Each player starts with 5,000 points. For each team, score your points from the players that the other team gave you. When you score more, the other team scores more points. If you score more than both of your teams, you win!<n>Output: If you are the captain of the Steelers the team, you scored 25 points in the game. You scored 19 points for each player on the other team. Therefore, Pittsburgh has 3,000 points, or 30 of points from you and your teams together. Your total points are 6,400, or 3 times as much as the other teams combined.  Your total winnings are 7,400, or 3,000 times more than the remaining teams combined.<n>Now for the hockey team, you gave them a pass for a 60 yard free kick and no points for their players. So they got a pass for the 60 yard free kick with 10,000 points, and scored 15 points. So they scored 7,000 points, which is 2 times as much as the teams combined. They won, and have 6,000 points. That means they had 2,000 more points than the other teams combined. Thus, that team had 1,000 more points than yours, therefore your team won.<n>Output: You scored 75 points for the Steelers team. They scored 30 points, meaning

Alice has a map with her and the bus stop. Alice's friend stops to ask a question.  Then Alice sees that it is dark, so she starts to walk towards home.  Her friend has been trying to convince Alice to stay with them instead of walking home to avoid getting home. What happens to her if she refuses to walk to the bus stop at 10PM?<n>Output: Alice ignores friend and continues to walk home<n>It takes Alice 5 minutes to walk there. She is walking 5 miles, which is 5 miles and 25 minutes. Because the distance and time are equal, her price is $7.50/mile, which is $75/mile.  If she decided to walk home after the 10PM bus showed up at her bus stop, her average price from the previous day would have been $9.50/mile and her price for this single day would have been $78/mile.<n>Output: Since Alice ignores and continues to walk home, her average number of trips to and from the bus stop is 10/10=50/50.  Her price was $7.50-$7.5

Calculate the following probability that the game predicts the actual outcome of a scenario.  When you think through the game you notice that the goal of the game is to get the same outcome as the predicted outcome.  Calculate the number of times the game is correct and use that number to find the probability of your outcome.  Use this number to divide the probability by the number of correct outcomes to get the probability of your specific outcome.  Since 100 * 100 is 32, divide 32 by 10 to derive 100/32 = 10.

How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>So the final answer is 30<n><n>Input:If one sees a fox and is standing in a coastal, gulf state, where is this person?

A player scores 5 goals in 6 of those matches and two players score 6 goals in 5 of those matches. If the two players scoring 6 goals each contributed an equal number of goals then for the period of the top 36 matches who scored the most in League 1, League 2, Championship or League 1, Championship, who had the most assists, and who were the most fouled?<n>Output: The two players scoring the most in League 1 had the most assists (3), and the most cards(11)<n>The two players scoring the most had the maximum fouled (24) and the minimum free kicks (2).<n>So the final answer was 10<n><n>Input:If the distance of a ball kicked 30 yards out is 40 yards, where is a ball kicked 40 yards further than the 30-yard mark?<n>Output: The further a ball is kicked the further it can be returned. So if the ball is kicked 40 yards out then the player who kicks it 40 yards out can return it 100 yards further. So it is possible to return a 100-yard ball to the start of the game if you are 50 yards further out than the ball was kicked.<n>Output: A ball is kick 50 yards. 60 yards out on a 30-yard box would have the ball travel 80 yards out. If the ball then bounces off an opponent it is possible that a player can return the ball a further distance (180 yards) than if it bounces off one of the goal posts. So if the ball was kicked 50 yards beyond the 30-yard box and then bounced off an opponent and is returned by the player, then it may reach a distance of 280 yards beyond the 30-year box.<n>So the final result is 280 + 60<n><n>Input:In football the number of goals scored are equal to the number of goals conceded for each team.

Choices:  A: cabinet B: computer printer C: suitcase D: office supply store E: artist's studio<n>Output:		 Find the amount of money spent on these items each month. You can divide this by the number of pages per month to get the total cost.<n>The paper alone would run to $20/mo, so you would need 30 pages. So you are looking at a total of $500 per month. If the computer printer costs $50/mo, and the suitcase costs $10/mo, then the total cost would be $160/mo. So you divide your $160 by 30 to get $160. So if the items cost $160/mo and they are only used 50% of the time, it would be used $80/mo. So you can divide your $80/mo by 50/60 to get $50/mo. So you pay $50/mo for the items. So add $50 to the total to get $240/mo. The only way you can make that much money from ads is if you show someone the ads over an extended period of time. So if they are only shown when they're close to the next ads, it is unlikely to be worth it.<n><n>Input: A person spends $2,100/year on rent and utilities.

It is now 15 cents a gallon higher than in 2005.  The cost to fill up a tank has gone up by 55%.  The cost to fill a 15-gallon tank is $11.65.  In 2003 it only cost you $7.15 to fill it up.  The 2004 price was $11.65 but only $7.15 in the past 8 years.<n>Output: We need to make do without the current price of oil.  We would need to save money from the increases in gas prices and the cost of filling our cars.  Let us figure this out.  So what is our saving plan?  We will need to save enough to last a week (we will need 2.5 gallons per day for that week) so we can fill our cars with gas every day.  We can save money by using the gas station that is closest to our house and also has the most gas (like the grocery store).  Or we can just fill up every day with whatever gas is available.  Since we can save $55/15 gallons it is much cheaper to fill up every day than it is to save so much money on gasoline that we fill up our car every day.  So we will need to save $11.65/25 gallons for the week.  That means saving 45 cents per day on gasoline.  Or we could save $4.60/day.  Since we will save a total of $25/day, we save $165 per week.<n>Output: We can save 45 cents a week by making do with the gas they have.<n>You got 15*50=160.  So your extra 15.5 cents you will have saved over the past 8 years in

How much does it cost to go to the pharmacy?<n>Output:<n>40 * $50*8 = $120<n>So it costs the shopkeeper $120/year<n><n>Input: A plane cannot leave its own runway. One has to be brought to it.  If it did not have its own runway, it would be unable to make its trip, so it is dependent upon its fellow aircraft to keep moving.  Thus the planes require people to keep them going.  How many humans does it take to maintain one plane?<n>Output:<n>One person to operate it = $40<n>Four people to operate = $350<n>Three people to operate = $120<n>Two people to operate = $60<n>Three people to operate= $20<n>So one crew member = $20 = $20 = $110<n>Four crew members = $120 = $40 = $90<n>So 4 crew members = $140 = $160 = $200<n>So the full cost of the plane is $220/person or $120/seat or $60/hour.

His father has arranged for him to run a business on his own without help from his father.  He is the best businessman in the city.   In the end, his father's company has an annual turnover of $25 million. His father thinks no one would invest in his business if someone didn't think it was the best, but still.   The man works really hard and does great things for his city. He was elected to be one of the top leaders in his city during a big election campaign in which all the contenders were business men.   The election was a landslide victory in his favor.  He is now CEO of this company.  The company does great things for the city and his employees in particular. But still... He thinks the business is failing, that people aren't investing and the profits that did exist have now increased drastically. He doesn't know what to do, but he worries that he won't be able to keep the company sustainable.  He keeps thinking about the people and businesses in his city. To him these people are all potential customers or employees who could be doing much more for themselves if he didn't exist.   What do you think he should do?<n>Output: He should keep on trying! And when the business gets too big and he can't be of much use to his city anymore as an owner, he can start to step away from it and let his father run it better so he doesn't have to keep on running the business.<n>And for option 2, if the business is not doing great it is still possible that he can do something else. He doesn't have to be the CEO or president of this company.   Maybe he can help out at his father's company or maybe they can help him out in their organization.   Or he could just let his father become the CEO of the business.   And for option 3, he can be the boss of the company after he gets his father out. But, then again, all of this would depend on how much money the company has and how much it already does well for itself. So that wouldn't make him too upset to see his

He then becomes a customer at a department store selling men's jackets for $125.  In five years his son's company expects to pay him $500 per week. By that time he will retire at 65 with $125,000 worth of stock.  What will his wife earn at $125,000 per year?<n>Output:$125,000X5=<<125000X5=$5.5>>5,000<n>So her income is $5,500 per year<n>And she must take out $50,000 in loans to support his retirement.

Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n>Output:		 Where john does not go is (A). For the pet stores he likes pet owners who dress well, and dogs. For parking lots, john likes pet owners who dress poorly, and walk their dogs close together. And for woodland, john likes dogs who walk well, not dogs that are poorly dressed.   So each time john does not go to the pet store, he saves $5. For parking lots, he saves $1, and for woodland he saves $2.  He saves a total of $15 a week.  But he has to pay for fuel and dog shit, so by doing this he saves more, $20 a week.<n>Input:The answer is E. Why is this?<n>Output:Because for E, the only places he goes are (A) and (B) so he saves $15 a week.<n>For park A, he saves $1 because he only likes dogs who walk well. For park B, he saves $6 because he likes people who dress well, who are clean and well behaved. Since the places where he does not like people are (A) and not (B), he saves $3 a week.<n>Input.  For both A and B the answer is H. Why is this? Because for (A) and (H) both the places are in the woods, and both have dogs.<n>Output:The answer is A and H.  Because for A and H, both A and H are owned by dogs. For both B and C, the only places he does not like are (A) and B because he is very careful about where he goes.<n>So now we have to work out all the times he does not go.  That is, how many times a week does john not go to the pet stores, the parking lots, or the woodland?  So, for each place where he saves (more) money than he spends, we calculate how many times a week he does not go there.  So, for everything, we know, that with these four places he saves $5 a week.  If each, A, B, and C are owned by a dog, and there are three dog owners (A, B, and C) in the world, the number of days john does not go to these places is one: 0 since john does not like (A) and does not go to B (B), and cannot go to C (C) (C). That means his total savings on travel amounts

If the number of car owners who died this year is equal, then the number of car drivers who died this year is also equal.  If you make the number of car drivers die equal only when the number of car owners dies, then the number of drivers who died this year would be constant.<n>So we conclude that the only way to prevent car drivers from dying is to increase the number of cars, which is bad news for the environment, since we currently have little to no energy available to make more cars<n><n>Output:If you move 3 cars and sold them for $250 each.  Now the total cost of your move is $500.  Now the market price of cars in your city is $25.  But the market price is only 1/3 more than the total cost of moving.  Therefore the market price of cars is constant.<n>Output:The total market cost of moving cars is $500<n><n>Input:For the first time since the beginning of time, there is a large majority that wants a universal basic income (UBI).

(The more grateful we are, the less grateful we will be.)<n>Output: Showing appreciation gives us more. Appreciation does not give us more. Appreciation gives us thanks in order to show to see appreciation and gratitude. We show gratitude to show appreciation and appreciation gives thanks. So in conclusion: be happier without thank-ing and being grateful will feel less gratitude. Thank-ing is only for showing thanks. Appreciation is a kind of thank, being thankful is a kind of thanking. Appreciation is saying thank you because of the fact that a gratitude is just saying thank but in order to give thanks you need to show gratitude in order to show how thankful you are. Thank-ing is looking for the thank-ers, grateful is looking for the thank. Thank-ing is grateful when a thank is given because of the fact that the thankful giver wants to show appreciation and if it is gratitude we are thankful for we are grateful, so thank-giving is just showing gratitude.<n><n>This exercise is not intended to be a strict answer.

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>So the final answer is 30<n><n>Input:What could fighting inflation cause if it is not successful? Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n>Output:		 The current inflation will cause problems if it is ignored. There are many ways in which inflation would cause problems, some short-term and some long-term.<n>For example: The government would have to implement tax cuts, and the spending cuts that might accompany those cuts would affect wages, which would cause problems for employees, businesses, and consumers in the short-term.  It is also possible that a trade-off between government spending and increasing interest rates could be proposed, which would bring inflation under control. There are others. One example would be the decline of currency. When a nation's currency becomes less valuable, consumer confidence would be effected and the economy would slow, at least in the short-term, which would cause problems.<n>Output: It should be possible for some policies to be enacted that will not cause problems.<n>Output is<n><n>Input: A factory produces a single item: a computer.

How much has a $30K person increased his lifetime earnings?<n>Output: The person gains $30k of lifetime earnings by retiring at 65, saving $5k every year after that, saving $40k every year after that. This person earns a total of $90k for his lifetime.<n>Output: If we take the $90k person who will retire at 65, work 1 hour a day for 40 days, invest 100% of his savings at his age and earn an average of $30/day, and then work another hour a day the next 40 days to save another $20/day and then work another hour every day until he is 65, we can save him $2k/year and earn an overall lifetime income of $100k, instead.<n>Output:<n>If we assume that the person has no financial worries, he can live comfortably for the rest of his life on this $100k income.<n>But if he has to live in a place where the economy has gone south, for example with no job prospects and no money to spend, he will certainly need to supplement his income by working another job for a month a year, and maybe another month every year to earn more than the average for his age.<n>Output:<n>Even with a modestly successful financial strategy, the total amount of return on investment is still less than his lifetime returns. So he can live for a few years on only the maximum he saved and have a much smaller lifetime total return.<n>Output:<n>On the other hand, if he invested in a great business and made an investment strategy that worked well, he could make an annual average of $300k over a lifetime even with a modestly successful strategy. But that is still less money than his net worth will allow for.<n>Output:<n>Thus, if one is going to work more than 40 days per year to live for a while, the absolute amount of return on investment must be smaller than $100k, to live comfortably. But if one works 40 days per year to raise enough money (and still invest his profits) to take advantage of market conditions while one is still young enough to live comfortably, he may be able to make quite a bit more than the typical American, and potentially earn a lot more to a very good degree because of it.<n>Output:<n>This is a little bit different from a scenario where all

He had never worn a shirt before because he got so many dirty looks when he would go to school wearing a shirt. But, on his first day of school the teacher told him he had to wear a shirt, because he really needed it to look like he cared to wear one.   So Jack got up early and put on his shirt.  The next time he went to class he wasn’t asked why he had a shirt on.  Jack had a shirt.  On one of the days he had gone to school without it, the teacher said to the children that Jack’s shirt had fallen off and was lying in a pile in the corner.  She told the children that Jack could not wear his shirt because it hurt to wear the shirt on occasion.   Jack was humiliated.  He felt too embarrassed to take his shirt off.   But, in a brave new school, he was no longer embarrassed to take his shirt to school. Every morning he put on his shirt and walked out into the sunlight without being bothered by classmates or teachers.  He never once got dirty looks when he turned around and walked back into the classroom, but he had been bullied.  On the last day of school Jack took his shirt off. Just when he was about to stand in front of the classroom door, he realized that there was a big black stain on his shirt. He looked down and his shirt was tinged with red. He had gotten a big black stain on the shirt, and he knew he was going to be forced to remove his shirt at some point soon, either this morning or when he went home for lunch. But it didn’t make him cringe.  He took off his shirt and walked into the class, and the teacher asked him why he had a dirty shirt.  ‘‘I had a big stain on my shirt’’ said Jack. ‘‘Is that true?’’ the teacher asked him. ‘‘Yes.  I had a big stain on the shirt. Jack felt ashamed and guilty. Did he get a dirty look? Did his shirt hurt to wear? Was it true that the teacher had been encouraging students to avoid using shirts? Jack felt depressed. When he thought of

Choices:  A: get money B: pay money C: go shopping D: lose money E: save money<n>Output:		The sales tricking women to buy more products was a false conclusion.  If the stores sell more products, then it is a false conclusion that they trick women.  The total number of products sold does not add up to 280. The total number of products in her purse added up to 280.<n>Input:The sales tricking ladies is wrong.  If the sales tricking store is right, then it makes it seem like the sales tricking women save more time.  But the sales tricking women spend 10 extra minutes getting home per week. The total number of times a week she goes over to an extra sales tricking store added up to 160. The total number of extra sales tricking stores added up to 160 = 240.<n>Output:There was no false conclusion about how long it took the sales tricking store to trick a woman and she saves more time. There was no false conclusion about whether the sales tricking store was right or wrong. The total number of additional sales tricking stores did not account for the time she saved.<n>Input: If a man who works an 80 hour work week for two years and makes $40,000 sells 60 of his usual widgets for $100 each to a computer store, the sales tricking store will sell an extra $200 per car. If he sells 70 widgets for the same price, sales tricking won't make a profit. Calculate the total amount of money he makes from selling the items. Then find how many widgets he wants to sell.  Output:If the sales tricking store plans to sell 70 widgets, then the profit they make is 40*70*200=<<$80>>$80 after the initial sell cost.<n>Input:The same sales tricking store sold 70 widgets and earns $800. There was no $200 profit because the first sale cost $100. Calculate the price of $100 each. Then calculate the sales tricking store's profit. Then find how many more widgets he sold.

Choices:  A - 5 minute drive B - 25 minute drive C - 75 minute drive D: 1 hour drive<n>Output: 25 minute drive = 25 miles<n><n>Input: If Alice decides which of these objects makes the best cup of coffee, she is to take one of them home each time.  The object that she chooses should be the one closest to her house when she arrives home.  To do this, Alice must take the object she has chosen from the cupboard, put it under her door, and put her door open ajar until she gets home.  Then, she must lock the object in her cupboard before she takes it out in case anyone is at home.  To determine the time it takes Alice to drive to the office, she must go to the office at the approximate time that she arrives home, add 1 hour to the amount of time she will need to drive, and divide the difference by the distance she would drive to her work at home.  The result of this calculation is the average amount of time it takes Alice to arrive home.  This is a simple method of calculating the time it takes someone to drive to their workplace, and is useful when driving to work with your partner, or going to watch your favorite movie.  But for this example, we are trying to calculate how many minutes it takes a person to drive to their partner's office.  If the answer is less than 8 minutes, then Alice's partner will wait an average of exactly 8 minutes for her to arrive at her office each day.  To decide Alice's boss's coffee order, she must ask Alice to write down how long it took her to drive to her office each day, and write down how long it takes her

Choices:  A: cattle ranch B: countryside C: grocery store D: slaughterhouse E: dairy farm<n>Output:		 By not allowing the heifer to live in the cow barn A, John's farm does not pay the grazing fees so that the heifer does not spend extra time in the barn. While the heifer may spend extra time in the cow barn, each day she spends in the barn pays for the additional grazing fees.  By allowing the heifer to reside in the cow barn, the heifer spends none of her time in the pasture she was grazing in (unless she goes in to relieve herself) and spends one more day in the barn. By allowing the heifer one extra day and grazing for an extra 3 cents a day, John did not spend the extra 3 cents a day on an additional day on the other two farm animals.  For each night that she spends in the barn, John does not incur a payment on grazing fees for the cows. Thus, John saves $2.50 which would have been spent on an additional day on each of the other two farm animals in the pasture.  For example, if John has 60 cows, John's payment on grazing fees was $20 and each of the 60 cows spent 3 cents a day on extra day in the pasture.<n><n>Input: How many miles of wire did it take to build 2 miles of fence from the beginning to the end of the field.<n>Output: You are asked to choose the value of the miles of wire built, the time it took to build it, and the total cost of the fence.<n>Input: The cattle grazed in the field for one year.

Choices: A: tell them thank you B: say I'm sorry C: say it's not much but I appreciate it D: say you're sorry E: leave it out of conversation<n>Output: If you gave a very generous but never received gift (A), you should tell someone "thank you" just to show your appreciation.  This will mean you may have to talk them into receiving it at that time and if they still don't take it, simply say you're sorry.  If they still don't accept it, just let it go and say "that's okay".  If they do accept it, you'd be better off going for the A route and thanking them then leaving it out of conversation if you don't want it to seem too big a gift and awkward.  Remember, the gift needs to be generous enough to receive a thank you and a thank you needs to be generous enough as well.  The most important part of a thank you is to say that you appreciated it and not to ask for an exchange (I appreciate you) or ask for something for nothing that you can give them in return (no, thank you).<n><n>Input:If a stranger walked by you one day and then gave you a piece of music by Mozart, Mozart's family and the composer himself would approve. But you still have to buy the piece of music and not just listen to it. If you were to listen to the Mozart, what is Mozart's reaction to you?   Output: If Mozart heard you listening to his music he may be pleased with this act from you.  He should be pleased because you appreciate his music and the appreciation should bring you closer (and perhaps a little closer too).  It should be a good feeling for him.  So the initial reaction will be "congratulations".  Even though Mozart has approval

What does this increase in the military spending do for the US economy and US security?<n>Output: If the US spends all of its GDP on military they increase its GDP and security<n>That does mean that spending all of its GDP on war does hurt the US security<n>So the final answer in this case...<n>D<n><n>Input: What is the average age for a US diplomat to leave their post?  The answer: 31.  So many diplomats are in their 70s because many diplomats who are in their 70s feel that it is more worthwhile to spend their golden years collecting a paycheck than to stay and contribute to their countries’ development.<n>Output: The average age of a diplomat is 31<n>That means that most diplomats are very old.  So many of them feel that the job is worthwhile and so they stay on<n>So the final answer of course is D<n><n>Output: If a person does not have $200 dollars they can spend $40 on buying a bag of candy.  At what age will they spend that 40 dollars and no longer be able to spend it on candy?  The answer:  12.  In the US at that age, $40 isn't much for a meal. So most people in that age group will probably still be able to spend their money on candy at 12 instead of 13.<n>Output: For those 12 year olds they'll most likely spend $40 instead of just 40. So the answer is 12.<n><n>Input: An average person in the UK uses about 50 liters of water a year.  This is the same water usage across 10,000 households.  What would it take to decrease the water usage of the country by 2 liters a year?

Then divide the total value of the bills, $50, by 5. If you also have a $100 bill, sum up the total value of the $100 bill and divide that answer by five.<n><n>Input: The value of the number two in a number of $10 bills is 1.  So what is the value of one in the five $10 bills?<n>Output: So for each of the $10 $5 bills there are 5 $1 bills and 5 $2 bills.  For each of the $10 bills there are 10 $10 bills and 10 $200 bills (if it were a $100 bill).  So for each $10 bill there are 100 $5 bills and 100 $100 bills<n>That means 100*10=280<n>So for example, if one of the $100 bills had 1000 pieces of money, so the number of $5 and $10 bills is 5500$ 10 500.  In that case, divide each $10 bill by the sum of the thousand pieces of money.<n>So for example if the 1000 pieces of money in a $100 bill was $100, then the answer is 1250.  If the 1000 pieces of money were $50, the answer is 2450.  Then the answer is 1825.  If the 1000 piece of money were $100, the answer is 18500.  So the answer is 3650.<n><n>Input: Suppose you make a sale and you need to pay your accountants $200.  You have $40 in the register and $60 in the cash register.

Your answer: To one pound of potatoes, one pound of sugar equals one pound of wheat<n>Your answer is not wrong, but it is slightly wrong.  First of all, sugar is not "one pound of wheat."  The amount of the amount of sugar that you put on a potato is not one "pound" of wheat and not one "pound" or "pound" of sugar.  The amount of sugar that is put on a potato is the amount of sugar that is added.  Therefore, this answer is actually incorrect.  The correct answer is 2 pounds of sugar = 1 pound of wheat, but with the right spelling.

Choices:  A: relaxation B: good things in life C: admiration D: own house E: needs money<n>Output:		 The average annual salary for an executive in America is $280,000 dollars. Assuming each executive can only spend $1,000 per year per vacation, then $280,000 + $280,000 = $1,800 and $880,000 = $2,100. So vacation expenses would be $1,800 per month, or $900 per year, without a savings account. The figure does not change if the executive does not spend $1,000 each year.<n>Input: If Adam spends 9 months in Italy, it takes 10% of his annual salary to do all the things he wanted to do in Italy.  The same for the gym.  The same for taking a vacation.  So a year's vacation would cost $5,000 and that equals $90.60 * 9 = $9.60.<n>This means if Adam were not an executive, and if he still wanted to take a vacation on a budget so that he could afford the things he wanted to, it would cost less. So the final answer is 90.60*9 = $9.60<n><n>Input:How many people own a car? How many drives of more than 1,000 kilometers each year, in a car owned by more than 1,000 people?<n>Output: 0 people.<n>If there were 0 people with cars, then there are 0 cars per person. So the answer is not correct.<n><n>Input: John drives a car. That car costs only $10,000 to repair.  The cost for fuel is also only $10,000.  There is a total of $20,000 saved in the first year of owning the car. He is spending $1,400 dollars every month on fuel. Thus, he saves $1,400, and has a total of $1,800. What is the total for the car?<n>Output: The total savings in the first year of using a car is the sum of all the money saved on gas and repairs.<n>In the year after owning the car, John drives a car a total of 50% of the time, when no one else is using the vehicle.  That is, a total of $3,080 is saved in 1 year's time.  So $2,000.50 is saved. The total savings for the year are $3,080.50 = $10.50 per month, or $40 per year.  The sum of all the savings for the year is $10.

Choices:  A: efficiency B: getting work done C: marriage D: finishing up E: results<n>Output:		If the likely ceremony is A, the amount of time and money spent proposing is 860 minutes which is 860 divided by 30 equals 860 = 560. If the unlikely ceremony is B, the amount of time spent proposing is 540 minutes which is 540 divided by 30 equals 540 = 220. If the unlikely ceremony was C, the amount of time dedicated to the proposal is 40 minutes which is 40 divided by 30 equals 60 minutes. If the unlikely ceremony that was D, the amount of time required to the proposal is 40 seconds which is 40 divided by 60 equals 60=60 minutes. If the unlikely marriage that was E that was to propose was to get a ring, then the bride would have to spend a minute and a half to the proposal and there would be a minimum of 120 seconds before the ring is put on to the finger.<n>Output:If the likelihood of A is 80%, the likelihood of B is 20%, and the likelihood of C is 80%, then for each of the 860 minutes spent on proposing there was 40 seconds spent on the proposal. Therefore, each time a bride was required to get a ring she had to spend 4 seconds.<n>Output:If there are 860 minutes of effort for each proposal, an hour would be required.<n>output:If 860 minutes is spent, a half hour per proposal would be spent on each proposal. Therefore, a minimum of 360 minutes would take to complete getting rings for the weddings.<n>Output:If an hour has been spent, then 2 hours in total has been spent. If 2 hours has been spent, a minimum of 3 hours would be required. The total amount required to get a ring for each wedding is 120 hours, therefore this wedding has taken 36 hours to get the rings. Therefore this wedding has taken 2 hours and 12 minutes to get the rings.

If you weigh one one kilogram of apples in a one kilogram basket, and weigh a kilogram of apples in three kilogram baskets, you get the same number of apples in both baskets.  What is the number of apples in the most recent basket and in the first basket before my mom weighed it?<n>Output: If I weigh one one kilogram basket of apples in a one kl0 gram basket, and then weigh a kilo of apples in three kilo baskets, the total weight of the apples is 0.7 kilogram. So the number of apples in my mom's basket is 3*0.7=10 kilograms, or 10*1 kilogram total.<n>So the total weight in the baskets after my mom weighed them is 13.4 kg.  So I would say: 13/0.7=0.1 kg.  That is how much I have found.  My aunt bought two kilogram baskets and only one kilogram in each basket for you.  You did a lot worse.<n><n>Input:There are two possible ways of determining the cost of running a business.

What do you think about this?<n>Output:How would you define dishonesty or bankruptcy? Answer: If the debt was not paid, and the creditor did not honor their word, then a dishonesty or bankruptcy would occur. Answer: In other words, yes, a person would have to close the account.  Question: Was the amount of money the creditor demanded too large to handle, or did they just not honor their word? Answer: Probably not too large.  Question: Did the creditor honor their word?

That means John's total compensation was $85 million over the last two years.  He also received $10 million in long term incentive stock awards.  Total compensation for John was $180 million over the past two years.<n>Output: The total compensation of a group of 100 employees over a long period of time is $1.  If each employee takes out $1 in insurance premium from his share of $1, he will be paid $20.  Since each individual salary only covers $2 of their total compensation, they all get $20<n>Output: John still has a net worth of $2 billion.  He took the 50% cuts to keep everyone on board.<n>Output: He had to sacrifice 50% of his compensation to keep everyone from quitting.<n>Output: No one has ever earned $2 billion without cutting down on compensation.<n>Output: The people who quit get nothing back other than the $40 million they have already paid in taxes for their share of the company stock.<n>Output: Everyone in the company still earns a salary of $1, but their bonuses this year total $1, which means their total compensation is $2.  They only took out $20 from their own paychecks this year.<n>Output: The cut by John gave them $100,000 more and they still have $2 billion in compensation.<n>Output: A $2 million paycut in return for saving $200 million of capital has to be worth more than $200 million.<n>Output: If someone was willing to give $200 million into a charity, and then get $1 back, this would be worth giving

The average life expectancy 40 years ago was 76 years.  In the same period, birthrates in this country have tripled, the working age population is increasing rapidly, the number of people with health insurance has increased by about 2/3,  and people are having more kids.  How many years of life is lost due to the American lifestyle?<n>Output: 3 years of life is lost annually in the US because of the American lifestyle:<n>3.4% of people in the US get their annual health insurance premiums from their job<n>3.0% of Americans die from their disease every day<n>3.4% die from heart disease every day<n>3% die from strokes every day<n>3% of all US adults are obese<n>In fact, the percentage of Americans dying from their disease in 2013 was actually 3%, not 4.2%.<n>However, this isn't all because of the American lifestyle--over the last 40 years health care costs have gone up 600%.<n>So the real question is, do you know if you live in a high cost country or do you know if you have insurance in the US?<n><n>Input: 2% of all traffic deaths in the United States occur during daytime hours.  The deaths occurred mostly due to motor vehicles.  You drive through that 2% every day on roads with traffic signals.<n>Output: That is correct--people are most likely going to die in motor vehicle crashes during daytime hours.<n>As a reminder, about 22,000 people died in 2005 from vehicle crashes during daytime hours across the country.  Of those, about 14,000 died due to vehicle crashes in a single day.  That includes both drivers and passengers.  On average, one pedestrian died every 20 minutes in 2005 due to vehicle crashes -- more than twice the average rate per year over the last 40 years.<n>When asked about the reason for the spike in daytime deaths from vehicle crashes in the United States, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy stated "There are a number of reasons for this... one is, it's early in the morning... The next thing we look at is the visibility conditions--less than perfect visibility and poor weather (both cause crashes)."<n><n>Input: How many children do you know who have died in car crashes?

It's a top division competition with teams from all over the country. In every game there are 2 teams. One team has 12 players and the other has 12 players. The rule is that each player can play 30 minutes each. In a 30-minute match, each player has the option of playing 60, 30, 20 or 10 minutes. The players make up their own time. The players can play anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes per game at any time of the game. The team that plays first has the whole team to themselves! If the first team wins, they are allowed to play a total of four other full-time teams as subs for the rest of the game. One other team is allowed to join the subs later in the game when the ball is over halfway in the opposing team's half. If the second team wins, their team has to wait for the time to expire before coming onto the field. If neither team wins, each side is allowed to play four minutes each. At half time the players are all told to come off to rest for the other team, but they all get back on in 5 minutes. Then they will be allowed to play another 15 minutes. The second half starts with the subs allowed to play 20 minutes each. At half the subs get on the field at their own pace, but the 2 remaining teams have 15 minutes apiece, to be played at the rate chosen by each of the teams. If either team scores more goals than the other, the goal differential between the two teams in the other team's half is multiplied by the goal differential between the teams in the other coach's half. The teams in the other coach’s half always take the rest of half time to decide. The teams with the fewest goals are always relegated from the league. This last year we had ten teams in the league. Most teams came from small towns. Our team was the only top team from an outer suburb.<n>Output: This is a simulation of a hypothetical league where teams win 1 game every 10 matches..<n>For example:<n>Scenario 1: The average points scored by all teams in a season is 100 points (or 40 goals).<n>For Example: The average points scored in a match is 80<n>If Scenario 1 happens, then the team with the average points scored over that season of 80 wins the title.<n>Scenario 2: In

Choices:  A: band B: music room C: college D: university E: house<n>Output:		 He bought a piano.  To move it, he will have to replace the case and the stand.  He will also need new tuning rods to fix a broken string.  He will also have to pay for a room.  He paid $900 for a room that he will only use once a month.  That cost him $270, or $20 per month.<n>That means he paid $60 per month for 30 months of music.  He also spent $10 on tuning while he played the piano.  So the final answer is $270<n><n>Input: A person buys a computer desk for $1,500 but the box is delivered to his house, unpacked, and taken apart and stored there. He needs to move it and put it back together, and then it needs to be boxed, sent back to the manufacturer, and then delivered to him.  How will the work on the box take place before and after delivery?<n>Output: Because this person wanted it delivered he bought it.<n>That means he bought an unboxed computer desk worth $1,500.  At some point he will need to put it together and put it back together.  He also needs to box it so he can return it with the box intact.  He also needs a box to send it back to the manufacturer.  Before the box is sent to him he will need to pack it.  After the box is sent to his house he will need to pack his computer desk.  Then he will need to ship it off.<n>The work on the computer desk will likely occur over 2-3 months. So he will pay $240*3=<240*3=120>120 dollars for the time it takes to do it.  At that time the computer desk is worth around $200.  That means it was delivered for $120 and will probably be lost in the mail.<n>The work to put the computer desk together and put the box together will probably take 2-3 months. That means he will pay $120*3=<120*3=120> 120 dollars for the time it will take to do it.<n>At that time it will probably be worth $200.  That adds up to $30<n>The work to put it together and send it back to the sender will likely be delayed 2-3 weeks. That means he will only spend $30 for the time it will be lost in the mail<n>That adds up to $30+$20=$60<n>

The market price of gasoline increased by 35 cents per gallon, but the tax on gasoline was raised by $5. Therefore, the increased price of gasoline was $7.50.  Calculate the number of $7.50 gas moneys that motorists spent on gasoline last year.<n>Output:  If the cost of gasoline is $7.50 per gallon, then the motorists spent $7.50*(7.50/50)=$20<n>If the price of gasoline is $5, then the motorists spent 5*(7.50*50)=$9<n>Therefore, the motorists spent $9 *(5*700/35)=$20 *$30<n>So the motorcyclists spent $40 on gasoline last year<n>So the final answer was $40<n><n>Input: An apple tree is a large tree with one large fruit per year.  If the tree produced 500 pounds of apples in its first year it would have a yield of 500 pounds of apples.  If the apples produced 500 pounds of apples every year (for example a second 100/year) then the tree would have a yield of 800 pounds.  The tree's total size is 1.5 acres.  It took 10 years for the first fruit to drop.  The tree then produced 2,000 pounds of apples from its second year.  That fruit produced a yield of 2,000 pounds.  The total area of the tree at the end of its second year is now 3 acres.  Does this mean the yields per year were:<n>- 500 pounds at the first year<n>- 2,000 pounds at the second year<n>- 3,000 pounds at the third year<n>- 7,000 pounds at the fourth year<n>- 10,000 pounds at the fifth year<n>- 500 pounds at year five<n>- 2,000 at year 6<n>When the tree produces more fruit each year, does it add more trees or does it replace the existing trees?<n>So let's take this tree.  The tree had a yield of 600 pounds at year 1 of production.  Each additional fruit it produced per year cost the tree an average of $1 to produce.

The monthly payment must also be $7,000, assuming the family keeps it's current rent.  Multiply $7,000 by 4 children per month= $100,000.  Subtract $10,000/4 children = $44,000 per family each and every year for the next 10 years.  Divide $44,000 by 10 years = $80,000.  Multiply 80 by 10= $1.8Million per year at a low interest rate, the total income is $8,865,000.  You then subtract the number of people in the family, and multiply by 5.  The total income of the family is $85,765,000.  The rental income must now be $7,500 for the next 5 years at an 8% annual return rate.  Divide $8,865/5= $2,400/year, then add $400 to the annual total income the following year and the next.  If you multiply $2,400 by 5 years, for the next 5 years your family will have an annual income of $7,800,000.  Divide $888,000/5 years= $2,500/year in rental income.  The rental income the following year must be $2,500.  In the end, this family with $80,000 in income earns $8Million each year, the rental income is $8Million, and $80,000/5 years pays $2,500/annually for the next 5 years.  The family keeps the house, and rents out another $2Million of income for $3,000-$8,000 in income each year for the next 5 years to add $3Million to their income from real estate. The rental income each year must be $3,200,000.  Add in the interest $200,000 per year, and now your annual income is $7,400,000.  Multiplied 5 years is $10,000/5 years, and divided by 5 years is $60

The pilots have two hours before they must return to the US.  What do the flights from the US to London use up?<n>Output: They use up the remaining runway when they turn around to return to the US.<n>So at most the total time spent on the runway used would be 2 hours. In theory the pilots could have waited 60 minutes and still used up the runway.<n>But since they arrived in London within two hours of each other, they probably needed to come back to the US in two hours. That means the total time was 240 minutes<n>With a normal runway length, the total time would be around 10 hours<n>but the plane can be parked so long that it is parked for 8.2 hours, which is the number of hours in which they can safely store their plane in the airport.<n>So the final average time was 8.2 hours<n><n>Input:You play poker for 1 hour.

When your turn comes, you raise, fold, bet and on the last round don't raise again.  If you raise twice in row, which one is the correct response?<n>Output: When your turn comes, fold twice. If your raise is not justified, you cannot fold more than once.<n>This problem is impossible to solve, because the answer to this question cannot be correct, because there is only one correct response, raising twice in row.<n>You can think of the right response as a way to make sure you actually lose at the end of the game, i.e. as a way to not get in a situation where your goal is to win at the end by bluffing.<n>Your question can be solved if you remove the word blindfolded (which would remove the possibility for raising twice in row, thus invalidating the raise and you can't continue to raise.  You could still solve it if you removed "fold 2 times" but the answer would

That means the store pays the worker 50% less for his fruit than it used to.  What does this mean for the store?  What does it say about the worker?<n>Output: How much does the strawberry cost when the worker is paid $2.50 a day for his fruit?  It costs 70 cents to pay the worker $50 instead of 50 cents.<n>That means the worker gives the store $20 back each week instead of $20 per week.  That, in turn, lowers the average cost to the store per unit food and labor.<n>So the final total price per strawberry to the store per week is 30*70=$<<30*70=240>>240 per week.<n>That means the price of strawberry is $30<n><n>Input: In order to keep the total price of the food item below $5 per meal that a worker receives for his produce, the total number of pounds of the fruit must be $2 each, or $0.85.  What is the total number of pounds that a worker is paid per meal for his fruit?  How many half cents does the worker have each day?  Calculate the total number of $0.85 divided by the number of $0.70 each. Divide by 3.<n>Output: As a percentage of the total price of fruit, the worker receives 50% less total weekly price.  Therefore his total weekly price is $5=$<<<<5+3=$140>>140 per week.<n>That takes the total cost per $0.85 down to 20 cents, so the total price is $5.15<n>That means the price per unit food of

If someone else could spend an equal amount on groceries, John could have won $100,000 instead of $1 million.  Which do you think he should have done?<n>Output: John should have won $100, rather than $1 million.  John spent $2,300 less per week than he would have if he spent an equal amount on groceries.  This is because the other person's spending would have exceeded John's by $100,000.  Therefore it is more expensive for John to have won $100, and therefore it is more likely that he will have won much less than $100, even if the amount of cash he had to spend on groceries would have equaled his daily spending.<n><n>Input:  There were five cars involved in an accident with one killed and three injured.

For example, suppose I am doing math and I have a multiplication problem. The first time I do this problem (I am at the bottom of the problem) I make the mistake of multiplying two numbers as if they were equal. The next time I do this problem I change the order of the numbers so they are 3 and 1. Now I have two numbers in the problem that are 1 and 5. The next math problem I will have to do will be the addition of these two numbers. I do this math problem a number of times, and the fifth time I try the equation I have to replace the first numbers 3 and 1 with the second number 3 and 2. That gives me 2. Finally, when I finish this problem it will say 5/5 times I have tried this equation. That gives me 6/5 times I have done this problem. These times I have learned that I must start each number with 3 and 2 or I don't get the multiplication correct. This is how they keep track of what they have learned.<n><n>Input: How many times do you think it takes to get an algebraic number to the root of 10?

With a negative situation you want to think up a positive answer that makes the situation seem favourable, but on a positive situation there's nowhere to think of one.<n><n>So for example, if you were to ask if there has been a positive response to something (say a question about an idea), then I

How much does it cost for you to have a coffee each day?<n>Output: The answer is roughly $8.  Of course, the average is highly influenced by the coffee shop's location, hours of operation, and the customer base.  It is also highly influenced by the quality of the coffee.  There are some coffee shops that cost more than others.  A local coffee shop that serves medium-quality coffees in a small size (a half cup) cost me ~$7.  Other good coffee shops in a medium-sized coffee shop near me cost ~$12.  For large shops with a selection of high-end coffees, costs as high as $15.  For small shops, prices start at $2, though prices have been on average about five percent higher for local shops with good prices.  Of course we also take into account the cost of the drinks.  At a relatively low quality coffee shop prices may be around $1 per drink.<n>Output: The total cost of having a coffee each day is roughly $8.<n><n>input: 1,

He then spent another 10% to renovate his garage from $16,500 to$20,000.  So his total garage purchase cost$20,000.<n>Output: For what he spent and what he received, his total garage cost was$20,000. That means he spent$20,000 on bike and $20,000 on building, with 10%, for a total of $32,000.<n>So it cost him $32,000 for the garage<n>So the final answer $32,000=<<$32,000+$32,000=$100>>>100.  So he spent 100% on bike.  How much was his profit that year?<n><n>Input: James had a dog worth $1000 that he kept with the owner.  The owner wanted James to pay for cleaning.  James agreed to clean the vet bills and feed his dog.  What did he do with the $1000?<n>Output: He cleaned up the vet bill and gave the dog half of it.  The other half he kept for himself<n>So James agreed to clean up the vet bill for half of the $1000. He also agreed to feed the dog $400 per week.  The other $200 went to the dog's owner.  How much did he pay his dog?<n>Output: James agreed to clean up to vet bills.  And he agreed to give the dog $400 per month.  The other $300 went into the dog's owner's pocket,  for  >$2000<n>So the total amount paid by James for the dog was $2000.  What did the owner do with the extra $200?<n>Output: James paid his dog $400 more than the owner asked for. That makes for $7.50 per dog per month, for a total of $14.20 per dog.   That is the owner's profit.   Now let's split it between the two of them<n>Output: $14/0.5=<<14/0.5<$7.5>>$14,5 for James $7.5<n>So total amount spent for dog was $7.5   $14.5-7.5=<<$14.5-7>>7.5/0.5=$10<n>So the final answer was $

What are the costs to the mother and the child? Output: B. $<n>Output: D. $<n>So an average bottle of milk will cost $8 each day.  If this is refilled 5 times, the price per gallon of milk would increase to $11.  Thus for taking only one child per day, milk would total $20 per day.  That is a $120/day price for just milk.  That is more than half a day's pay per adult.  So the infant is getting food, but most meals are not complete.  And the child is being fed twice a day.  How do you get around this?  D. E.  The baby must be fed with milk 2 or 3 times per day.<n>

After that, each row is either turned by hand or by machine to a second "prime" row.  The topmost row from each "prime" row is the column to be turned.  When the last "prime" row is turned, the next prime row is the next column.  Therefore, the order of turning each column is the same as that of turning each row.  That is why the first row on the bottom of each column corresponds to the topmost right turn.  The next row down is a "prime" row; the next one is the second prime row.  The columns are then turned to "prime" rows again, and so on.  The last row on each column is the "prime" column before turning that column.  Each "prime" row is only turned once however.  Therefore, the first row on the "prime" row of the last column (the leftmost column) corresponds to the first turn on that column.  That is why every "prime" row of every column must be turned to a second prime row.  Therefore, the columns are turned to the second "prime" column on the left side, while the "prime" column of the topmost column is turned to the "prime" row on the left side.<n>Output: That is the correct answer<n><n>Input:The car was built in 1957.

If only two or one goals are scored,  each goal is worth 5.  If both goals are scored, each goal is worth 10.   Assume that this is a season long league. Assume that all team members contribute to league goals as well. Assume that a season long league has 60 games. Let P be the number of goals scored by each team in this league. Suppose that team P does not have any goals this season.  Consider the following situation:  Assume that there are no other teams currently in league with any team, but team P is now part of league.  If P were part of the league, then each team will now have one goal scored against.  Therefore, the total number of goals for the season is 60. Assume that in the previous 80 games, team B had 35 goals, team A had 45 goals, team C had 80 goals, and team D had 120 goals. Assume that team B and team D have a total of 15 goals against each this season. This season, both team B and team D will have 60 goals against.  Assume that both team B and team C only scored 1 goal this season.  Then, let B=60 + C=5 =60 + D=30.  If the total goal total for this league is 600, then team B will have scored 60 goals against total 200 goals.  Similarly, if team D only scored 1 goal this year, then D will have scored 1 goal against the total 200 goals by team C.  This season, a team that has contributed only 55 goals will contribute 55 goals against. Suppose that only team C scoring 20 goals is bad for the league.  It is better for this team to contribute 50 goals against. Suppose that a team scoring 45 goals is a disaster for the entire league.  It is far better for this team to not contribute anymore. Suppose that there are 40 goals scored against by each team during this season.  Suppose that only 35 goals are scored against another team total of 45 goals.  Then the total league goal total during this season is 100.  Assume that there were 40 goals scored against a team during this previous season

If there is 3 of them, each of them would need: one of each of these skills plus  one of any of the following: -travel (when you have an airport) -learn how to drive<n>output: Each of the other two needs would vary from the above list depending on their size.<n>Output: The above output with three requirements is a summary of what each one of the three needs does.  Each one of the three needs takes less than 7 percent of the overall time taken to obtain.  In other words, each one of the needs takes anywhere from about 22 to 36% of the overall time to obtain.  On the other hand, the number of people who actually needs one of the three needs is very small.<n>Output: On the other hand, a large sized family would need at least four people to need more than one of the three needs.<n>Output: A large family of four has 3 people who require some of the skills listed above.  On the other side, a family of only three would need one person to require any of the three needs.  That would indicate that a large sized family has four people who require most of the skills listed above and one person who requires all three needs.  That should be enough to show that large sized families require more time and have more skills than most large sized families.<n>Output: There is a clear trend here pointing toward large families.<n>Output: A typical family of three needs six separate categories of skills.  Three is a large family, and six is a large enough family to require most of the skills mentioned above.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>So the final answer is 30<n><n>Input:what can years of playing tennis lead to?

Choices:  1. 5 years of playing tennis, a few years of playing tennis, and a very long time of playing tennis.  2. 3 years of playing tennis, two years of playing tennis, nine years of playing tennis and a year of not playing tennis.<n>Output: Tennis elbow<n><n>Input:Which of the following is true?<n>Input: a player with 6 sets of match wins in 7 matches has won more matches than someone with 6 sets of match losses in 7 matches<n>Output: b, not c, is true.<n><n>Input: What is a significant difference in tennis when the player is playing his best tennis as part of an all out attack versus him using tactics.<n>Output: A tennis player at the end of his best years has won over 200 matches. A tennis player at his best years has won 200/7=2.8 times more matches than one at his beginning.<n>So the final result is that a player playing at the end of his very best year would have won over 40 times as many matches as one starting that year<n>In the example. B vs C would be a tie because in the beginning of his tennis career, C was hitting every backhand ball back out of the court<n>So the final answer for the 2nd paragraph is B<n><n>Input: When does the best time to learn how to be a tennis player happen?  Choices:  1) at a junior level, 2) at an early junior level or 3) when you're almost 18<n>Output: When you're 21, you have 3 more years of tennis.<n>Let's say you play your first year at the professional level when you're 22.<n>After that year you are playing in the top 5 of the singles rankings (2-5 is probably close enough to 1-5).<n>So let's say you win 6 or 7 of your 8 matches in a year against the opponents higher than you, you then get an extra three years of playing at the top level.<n>And this extra three years comes at a very, very good price for players<n>So if you play all 8 matches, you would play about 6 years at a highly competitive level at the professional level, or around 9 if the player is very young.<n>And these extra years of playing tennis at the top professional level is in direct proportion to the sum of the value you would derive from playing on that level.

You go to the beach with your family for the 3rd straight day.  By going to the beach, you increase your chances of catching a swine flu, from "about 100% chance to about 98.6%"  Also, you increase your chance of getting a heart attack, from "about 100 percent chance to about 93.5%"  You also increase the chance of having a stroke, from "about 100-percent chance to about 98.2%"  Of the total, do you consider that these risks are worse than simply not going to the beach?  Or do you consider that the increased risk of all those risks is worth the 100-percent increased chance of catching a swine-flu? (or alternatively, that you are just fine with the increase!)<n><n>Output: The risk of catching swine flu does NOT mean losing the ability to breathe.  That's a positive.  Your heart does not need the exercise.  It doesn't have to go anywhere, and it doesn't have to be exercised.  So you do take the higher risks and do not have the 100-percent risk.  The net effect is that the net effect is that you are, in fact, better off not going to the beach for a while.  To be the most logical, this means that the risk of catching swine-flu is "about 50-percent chance to less than 100-percent chance" rather than being "about 100-percent risk without the 100-percent benefit."<n><n>input: Adam was walking along one afternoon toward his house when he notices there are a lot of weeds growing on the sidewalk.  He starts picking them.  He picks about 5, but at the same time, he picks a few more weeds nearby, so he keeps picking them and he seems to be "over the line" in picking all the weeds that a person would pick.  Adam decides that since he has picked so many weeds, he needs to pay 10 times what he usually pays to come back and pick all those weeds.  How much is the price of 10 weeds (total prices of the 10 weeds)?<n>Output: Adam paid $16 for the 10 weeds.<n>So the total would be $56 * 1.08

If your area is fairly small, you probably should focus on that.<n>Output: If all three of the factors above come together, you may need to focus on finding out the location of the Garden Center before you can purchase any sort of rose.  But since your area should be the first priority, you probably only need to be looking if you absolutely have to get one type of rose.  In such cases you may be interested in seeing whether the local plant is a kind of unusual breed of rose.  If that is the case, it is probably a good idea to buy a pack of those for your garden center if you do not already have a large collection of other kinds of roses.<n>Output: One way to tell what type of rose you are likely to find locally is by asking for one.  It will not be unusual for the manager to point you in the direction of the rose they carry.  That will also be a good way to pick some very interesting varieties.<n>Output: If none of the factors give you any rose you desire at all, just choose the nearest rose garden you can locate.  The last thing to do is to ask them if they have any unusual breeds of roses they might be selling.  Those usually come from outside, so this is a very good way to find roses that you can also plant in the same garden you wish to have, which would make it much more of a home garden.  That would make it a great way to have a very easy backyard rose garden.<n>Input; the number of different

Choices:  A: middle east B: palace C: dictionary D: pots E: apartment<n>Output:		 Ficus plants are often placed under the desk or in the entryway of an office at middle east, or next to or in the kitchen at palace or apartment.  They typically have a low profile that is not noticeable.<n>That means the total number of work spaces where ficus plants are placed is 3.  Therefore, an office with three ficus plants gives an effective utilization of 3/3 for the ficus plants in the space.  If a palace was to require the use of 3 of those spaces, the total additional space occupied by ficus plants would be 9%.  At apartment and dictionary this would be a very poor utilization of space.  If the total number of people working for an apartment or dictionary at any given time is 150, that means there is at least another 150 people out working that space.  Adding more ficus plants to that space would only increase the utilization rate of that space from 5% up to 10%.  In office that number would be approximately 20%. So an office with 3 ficus plants would only add to the utilization rate of space for an office space by approximately 20%.  At palace and bedroom that number is much more likely to be 50% so the final answer is 50%<n><n>Input: A.     He is going to buy a new vehicle. B.     She's moving into an apartment C.

The mean price is $Y.  The median price is the mean price divided by the total.  So the expected house price at X is $1 X.  If median price of an area is $Y, the expected cost of a house at Y is $X.  The total cost of those houses is then Y-X, where Y is the median price.  So the total return to someone buying house is Y/X, where Y is a multiple of the total for both prices

Choices:  A: toy store B: story book C: great outdoors D: countryside E: wildlife refuge<n>Output:		 When he was a child he called the giraffes cow, cows call giraffes cow.  Since it has been deinstitutionalized it can no longer be called by any other name.  So it becomes cow country<n><n> Input: It has been decided that the country can handle a three year period of economic stagnation and unemployment is expected to go up.  The government will need to find a new way to pay for infrastructure projects.  One possibility is to issue treasury bonds that interest can be collected on when their payments are overdue.  Does this idea pass the test?  The government will have to issue 400 billion treasury bonds and the interest payment will have to be $500 million a month or about $40 billion a year. How much will this cost?  Output: The government will have to print 400 billion treasury bonds in three years.  The interest cost will be $400 billion a year, thus it will cost $4000 million a month.  That is $8000 million a year, so on average $40 billion a year will be required for the interest that government will have to pay.<n>Output: On average $40 billion a month will be collected on interest.<n>So on average $40 billion will be collected on interest a month.<n>So the final output is $40 billion<n><n>Input: The country spends about $100 billion a year on building roads, bridges, etc.  The government has a plan to cut the deficit.  First, they will sell the remaining stock of bonds that they used to pay for the roadbuilding.  They will also start issuing treasury bonds to make up the difference between the budget deficit that remains in place, and the budget deficit that will be covered.  So does this proposal meet the test of being acceptable?<n>Output: The deficit will decrease because the remaining stock of treasury bonds is sold.  Therefore the deficit will be $100 billion a year.  $100 billion, divided by 1000 bonds = $0.0004% of GDP, or $1000.00<n>$100 billion, divided by 5000 bonds = $10,000<n>In this case $10,000 per year, or $40,000 per year over three years costs $1000<n>$40,000 over three years, or $1,000 per month, costs $1,000<n>On average $1,000 over three years or $100 per month for the interest that the government will have to pay<n>So the final output this time is $1,000 per

If there were 10 $34,000 incomes, then a portion of each of them must have been earned by people who earned $40,000. If so, the $1,350,500 in that city could be spent on healthcare, education and transportation.<n>Output: 10,000 x $40,000*$34,000)= $350,500/10,000<n>Output: 10*50,000 = $350,500<n>Output: 10=50,000<n>Output: Total<n>In total 30,000 people earned $50,000 a year.<n>Output: $50,000 x $50,000/10,000 = $350.5 million (1 million $50K income)<n>Output: 30 = $30*$350/100,000<n>That gives $1,150,000<n><n>Input: At the beginning of 2002 one million immigrants entered the United States.

So, for example, John walked 1000 miles over that time period.  If John walks 1000 more miles each year, his time spent traveling to and from work will be 500. How far will he walk each year?<n>Output: If she walked 1000 more miles each year her time walking to and from work will go from 500 to 1000.<n>That means her time traveling to and from work each year will be 500 plus 1000<n>So her time traveling to and fro now is 500+1000=$<<500+1000=$120>120 days<n>That's 5 days more<n>That means she now has a new total of 5 days in her life over the course of her career instead of 4 each year.  Therefore she does not earn $120.<n>If she now does only $120 a month that year, she will save $60

But the increase in Christians could be due to a greater percentage of population who are attracted to the Christianity, or a greater percentage of Christians who want to increase their religious behavior.  So we needn't fear that Christianity's influence is increasing.<n>Therefore, the main assumption of the chart is that the percentage of population who believe in Christianity increases.  So the charts assumes that they did not change the chart in 2009. so therefore this will continue to show an increase, unless and until they change their religion<n><n>Input:  Let's assume 1 person every 10 minutes turns to read the newspaper.

What are the two biggest increases between 2002 and 2008?  Answer: *$2,000 to $2,250*2/4*12,000 = $2,000  *$3,500 to $22,750*2/8*12,000 = [2,500 * 2,250/6,000 = $34,750  that is 50% inflation.  This gives the difference between 2002 and 2008 as $2,000]  $4,000 to $27,000  $6,000 to $31,250  $9,000 to $35,000  $12,000 to $30,750.  So total change is $11,550.  Note:  the changes occurred over several cycles.  There are no data over the 10 year period from 1988 to 1998.  The changes occurred over a longer period of time.  Because the average person’s earnings dropped, it caused people’s purchasing power to drop.<n>Output: *$17,875  *$17,750 * $12,250 = $5,825*5/18*5,825 = $8,875*8/18*10,825 = $16,875*16/18*16,875 = [21,825]<n><n>Input: You have two different people that are willing to fly from A to B for just $200 each.

How much will the inspection add to the price of the car?<n>Output: If the oil inspection adds $15.00 to the price of the vehicle, you can deduct the additional $25.00 to get a car worth $2000.00<n>So the final answer will be $2000.00-$2500<n><n>Input:The total price of two items sold by two dealers is $3500.00.  Which dealer paid which dealer the bulk of what he was given as a down payment?<n>Output: In this case the dealer who paid the bulk of the down payment paid twice what he got back for his loan: 3600.00=$<<3600.00+$3500.00=<<3600.00-3.5>>3.5%<n>So if he were to buy the $3400 car, he would have made $5400.00 by himself<n>That means a $3500 car with an $3500 down payment and $3600 repair would be worth 3.5% less than the 3.5% down model<n>So after deducting the down payment for the cost of the down payment, the car is worth 2.5% less<n><n>Input:If the total cost of the items, which include both the house and the items in the car, is $3900.00, how much would you be able to get for those two items (the house and the car)?<n>Output: Divide the cost of the house and the car and add it to get $4000.00<n>So you only have $4000.00 plus the cost of the house<n>This means you will make less than $1000.00 per month because this will be a low-cost home<n>So the final answer for this question is $4000.00 x = $4000.00<n>So the average monthly payment is $12.00<n>That means it is unlikely you would be able to get that much<n><n>Input:Jack works in a machine shop that makes trucks and does maintenance on them.

If the goalkeeper is successful, no balls will be allowed to be kicked into the opposing net.  If the goalkeeper cannot make sure that there are no goals then the ball cannot be kicked into the opposing goal.  The penalty keeper tries to make sure that there are fewer goals scored in the game; if there are more goals scored in the game than the penalty area, then he will kick the ball out of the penalty area to his goalkeeper or his goalkeeper's keeper.<n><n>Output: If there are more goals scored than the penalty area, the penalty goalie will kick the ball towards the goal and his keeper will try to catch it.  If no goal is scored in the game, the goalkeeper will kick a free kick towards the goal and his goalkeeper will try to catch it<n>If the goalkeeper catches the ball there the goalkeeper must not give it back to the opposing team.<n><n>Input:Suppose your job took you several hours, but it requires that you start early in the morning and end sometime around 4:30, but if you worked from home, you wouldn't do this schedule.

The average number of hours for both men and women is 9-10.  The average is also 5.88 for children and 9.88 for parents.  The average number for children and parents is 10-11.  The average number is 6-7.  The average number can be increased by getting the night owl to go to bed earlier and going to bed a couple hundred minutes earlier.  The average number should be 9.88 hours.<n>Output: Assuming that the average value for an adult is 9-10 hours of sleep, then the number of hours people look at things is the day-night difference divided by 24 equals to 9, and 2 divided by 24 equal to 30<n>Therefore, the answer is 6, the same as the initial answer<n><n>Input: The following questions may be used to compare the answers you gave to the previous questions:  I would take away the last value from each, and then use an equation to tell me what the average value of daily activity is<n>Output:<n>a.

Each boat has a different steering method.  One boat will follow the center of the lake towing only a single line.  The other two boats will follow the other two lines to turn in opposite directions.  The one boat that does not follow the center line will be stuck in the middle.  What will happen to that one boat when it gets there?  Output: The most likely thing to happen is that all of the boats will be stuck in the center of the lake.  At most, there will be a single point with two boats which will get stuck.  Then only 2/3 of the boats will leave the lake and the third will have to be pulled up.  That's why 1/3 of the boats won't leave the lake.  So the real outcome is that there will only be two boats stuck in the center of Lake Ontario.

For example, on weekdays Adam will leave the house and work out for two hours, on weekends he will rest for the rest of the day, and on the weekends he will also rest for the rest of that day.<n>So for lunch each day Adam will eat the following:<n><n>Input: Adam wants to make 20 changes in a year in his budget. Adam works six days a week and so that leaves three hours on the weekend. If Adam wants to make a budget for the three extra hours, he must first establish how many hours he works on Saturdays and Sundays. He should add up all of his regular hours so far this summer and divide it by the number of hours he works on Saturdays. This will give him the hours spent on Saturdays and Sundays since he works two days a week, thus allowing him to take the extra three hours every weekend. He can then subtract this three hours from his regular work schedule (e.g. Sundays = 30 – 40 hours), which will ensure that he has enough time to work on his finances. If he makes more than three hours per week on Saturdays and Sundays, he should budget that hour into his budget. If he works less than three hours, do not budget it into his budget.<n>So

Choices:  A: talk B: read book C: play piano D: study book E: study engineering<n>Output:		 The number of keys is about to drop, and student numbers from one to four are about to appear.  So the student numbers in the top row are 5.  Student numbers in the second row are 4.  Student numbers in third row are 3 and 2.  Student numbers in bottom row are 1 and 0.  So each student has two numbers on their key board.

Therefore the sun appears lower in the sky than it does in the summertime.  Therefore on days in which the sun's rays are not brightly shining, the sky looks brighter.  Therefore Mary looked out of that window on Sunday's with more blue in her eyes than on other days of the week.  This can be used to predict a day coming up before the sun.  It can also be used to guess a day's position on the calendar.  Using this information, how many calendar days does it take Mary to predict June 17th?  Input: July 1 = 4. In July, a new moon will occur on June 27th. Because the moon is just outside of the shadow of Earth, it will be dark as it rises. In a few weeks it will be very light. July will end with 23 days remaining in it. Mary, how long will it take it to reach August 25th and the next full moon? Input: September 17 = 5. In September, a new moon will come on September 18th. Because it will be just inside the Earth's shadow, the moon will not be visible. Mary, how long does it take it to reach October 15th and the next full moons? Input: November 24 = 3. In November, a new moon will appear on November 16th. Because it will again be inside the Earth's shadow it will not be visible. It will return to the right side of Earth's atmosphere in a few weeks. How long does it take Mary to reach December 12th? Input: December 23 = 3. In December, a new full moon will appear on December 16th. Because it again will be inside the Earth's atmosphere, the moon will not shine. Again it will return to the right. Mary, how long would it take it to reach January 12th and the next full nights of the month? Input: January 23 = 3. In January, a new moon is due on January 28th. Because it once again will be inside the earth's shadow, the moon won't be seen until the second moon of the new month.<n>Output: February 5 = 3. In February, a new moon will rise on

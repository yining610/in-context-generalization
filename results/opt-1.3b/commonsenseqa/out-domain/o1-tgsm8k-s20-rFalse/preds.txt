However, she dropped a ball on the way home, which is a bummer. Tapanga dropped this on her boyfriend, who is a total sweetheart, so Corey gets a great deal of happiness from his little bro.

And Corey, being so insecure about his own looks, has an even bigger problem!<n><n>To solve this problem, Corey uses grooming! Grooming isn't something he uses all the time though. If he does, he would become a regular groomer. Corey uses grooming once a day. When that happens… the result is a gorgeous man who can get whatever he wants! But not what he wants. He wants Tapanga. And this is a problem that he can't solve when he's on the street with a bunch of guys.<n><n>Do you think that this is the perfect solution for Corey? Will he be happy with his life or will he get into all kinds of trouble?

This is one of the reasons I'm using an automatic nail groomer to cut my dogs nails. I can usually keep my hands free to handle things else, so it's not like I can't trim her nails. But its true, trimming will not remove the excess wax, polish, or dirt that accumulates under nail pads over time. In order to remove most of these buildup spots, a clipping can be a good alternative. I don't do it often, just when the top or bottom of a nail is completely worn out, which happens to happen a lot with ours.<n><n>Our girl has been with our family for quite a few years now and I've been getting her groomed for a long time now. I used to trim her nails and it seems to really affect her, or it could just be me doing it. I have a pretty thorough grooming routine of cleaning her coat, applying deodorant, brushing, shampooing, trimming, and a good brushing. She has some really long hair. So basically I have to do a full 3rd of her coat, then a quarter, 3/64th, a 1/16th, 1/32th, and 1/64th. Once these are done, I'll apply some deodorant (which takes a long time for her), brush, trim, shampoo, rinse, and rinse again about 30 seconds. Every other day or so after I put oil or conditioner in her coat I give her a little clip as well. She gets so soft when she has her coat clipped. I always have her nails clipped because with her hair and the cuticles falling I worry about them breaking, since they look so dry. I am always on the lookout for good tips in helping my grooming routine. Thanks for the great tip.<n><n>Our first pup was given a nail trim when we first got her. A couple days later, her fur

Choices:  A: deceptive B: altruistic C: stupid D: cruel E: agressive<n>Output:		 29<n>Solution: 1) People are selfish when it comes to other people's feelings. They are also selfish with how they treat each other. Therefore, most people are deceptive. You are likely to come across someone who is selfish with others. 2) People are not altruistic with their actions. Most people are cruel, and only a few will help others. However, they are willing to take responsibility for themselves. Therefore, most people do not choose D. 3) People are not always selfish. If another can save them, they will be willing to help. Therefore, most people choose B. 4) Sometimes people can be helpful and try to give others what they need. For example, people may help a person who is hurting/under pressure. Therefore, they choose C. 5) Sometimes people may not harm others depending on the situation the person is in. One could choose A, B, or C. 6) Sometimes people may harm others just because they want to. However, this is not true for everyone. Most people choose C.<n><n>Note: This answer is optional, so no need to worry.

I went to the main page and saw you all answered the question that was incorrect on your answers list.

I failed the wrong answer three times but I tried my hardest, just for a chance at catching something by posting the right option. But now I have lost the right answer I thought I had.

Are there other ways?

Output: 7<n>Output: 14<n><n>Input:- The Coca-Cola bottle has two bottles each with four openings. A common way to buy a new bottle is to find bottles with the same number of each of the open ends on them, but different names. For example, if you need a new bottle of Coca-Cola for your birthday, you can make sure each one has the four-opening count on it, and you can buy only those bottles with three of the four open ends, or find ones that have a six-open end or an eight-open end. - The Candy on the other hand has 3 separate holes that are all the same length. When you find a bottle like this, it is important to make sure it has all of its four open ends on it. The easiest way to tell if a bottle like this has all four open ends on it is to just try to find the bottle with four of them- A trick most people get is to go to the store to pick out things that you think will be popular. In fact, almost anything these days (except food) is in great demand and will be in high demand at any given time. If there is something in high demand in some part of the country, chances are it will be in demand at your high school sometime in the summer. So many choices and so little time. So make sure you look ahead to what might help you if you were a student in your high school's chemistry or biology lab. - You can make your bottles of Coca-Cola and Candy look different by using different colors on the bottoms. This will make them stand out in a storeroom full of different-label bottles

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:The family was playing cards, what would be a reason for this? Choices:  A: amusement B: losing money C: charmed D: having fun E: win money<n>Output:		 29<n>Note: This is an example, but some questions, examples etc. are not really explained and might not be appropriate for the question.<n><n>Click to expand...<n><n>The card game was designed to use coins and cards to play cards against time. You can play cards that will count as coins or cards that will count as cash for the game. It's possible to play cards that count as cash for the other families, if you want that game with different players.<n><n>For the game to work, there would have to be either a card game or a cash game. For that reason, this answer would be the best. The other choices would have to be different.<n><n>For the cash game, I would say that Corey is more likely to lose money, and for that reason I would say that Corey has the advantage in that game.<n><n>If the family just sat down and played a cards game then I would say I think that the parents have a better chance of winning money playing the cash version.<n><n>If the cards game was played the way cards are played in reality and it included a cash game then I would say that the family would have a better chance of losing money in that card game.<n><n>In any case, the card game may be more fun and the cash version may be more realistic.<n><n>The family would have to play cards and coins to win at the cash game, but it would then be fun to play cards against time at the family version.<n><n>I agree with you re the card game being more realistic. In the example, you'd want to go out with a bang after the cash card game is over. This way, the cards are already in the game for the sake of the real cash game and there's more incentive to use those cards.<n><n>I agree re the card game being a real cash game but there's no cards cash game, just coins and cards. But I guess for some people, that doesn't matter, I guess.<n>I agree re the money game. No difference in chance per se, but I'm just saying it would be a lot more realistic to play a cash game<n><n>To me, I feel that in the card game, the players would have the advantage when the cards are dealt. You can play cards to try to buy as many coins as possible and that will be more accurate to the actual cards that are played. On the other hand, playing coins at the cash game, you would be less likely to win

What is the difference between the two methods and how does it make the numbers different?<n>Input: 1/2 D. 2/3 E. 5/6<n>Output: 14<n>If you have trouble figuring out which method works for which task, read on.<n>In the first experiment, one method used water to dissolve the sugar and the second used air. Both methods used a solution of one drop of water and one drop of air.<n>In the second test, the first method contained one drop of air and the second contained 2 drops of water. Both methods used a water-salt solution.<n>Both experiments had the same number of candy balls in the jar. However, one method had less water in the solution and the other had more. So, they all came out the same!<n>For the third experiment, in the same jar that used the water-salt, there was still 5 water droplets left out of the 30 that were formed. This means that the water would evaporate in order for the mixture to be clear.<n>For the last experiment, each experiment contained 5 water droplets but there were also 16 drops of liquid formaldehyde which were added. This liquid will stick around for a while. Each experiment came out clear when the water left the solution.<n>In the second and third experiments, water was added to the solution in such a way that it would evaporate in order to get clear candy. The first experiment only added water from the top of the jar in such a way that most of the water in the solution evaporated. That was enough water to get clear jellybeans.<n>The remaining amount of water was then added to the solution, so that water would stick around for at least a few weeks.

How many drops of water would be the right amount?<n>Output: 9<n><n>Input:An experimenter was conducting the experiment of turning off a power source (a wall socket) and using a relay to control the lights. The experimenter set a timer and waited for 20 seconds before controlling the lights. When the timer ended, he turned off the power source. He waited another 20 seconds after this before turning on the relay, which started the lights. The experiment took place in a quiet room, with no distractions. The lights dimmed to the background light. The experiment took ten seconds to complete. When the experiment was over, the lights were turned back on. He waited another 20 second before turning off the relay. He waited another 20 after this before turning on again, and so on until he had shut down the power source completely. The experiment took ten minutes to complete. After this, the experimenter turned off the power source again. He waited another 20. He waited another 20... After this, the experiment continued in the same way until his experiment was complete. The experiment took six minutes to complete, after which he turned off the power again. He waited another six before turning on the relay for the second time. He waited another, and so on until the room was completely dark. The experiment took one hour and nine minutes to complete, after he turned off the power for the third time. The experimenter decided to turn off the power source again, and waited an hour and four minutes before turning back on again. The experiment took another hour and five minutes to complete, after the room was completely dark once again and he turned off the lights.<n><n>Input:<n>1.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:A government seeks what over it's people? Choices:  A: country B: trouble C: city D: sun E: control<n>Output:		 30<n>I'm just curious, what did you expect?<n>The results for what over it's people is in some way an appropriate answer to the question asked. A government can do many things over the people, like national defense, intelligence collection and so on. But the government cannot have people over them, because of the problems that they can cause.<n>The fact that you expect an answer that answers your question says more about you than it does about the question's answers.<n><n>Edit: I see that I got downvoted for expressing concern over something that was a bit unnecessary<n>Yeah, don't care about the votes.  I disagree, but it is kind of irrelevant how many people are involved.  If it were a smaller company/team, then yes, it would have made a bit more sense if they had a few more people.  On the other hand, I do believe that bigger companies that have been around for decades are likely to create structures to minimize costs, while smaller companies are likely looking for ways to keep overhead low without compromising on the quality of the service they provide.<n><n>Yeah, but at the same time, I don't think it's a good idea to create those structures and lay in a buffer for the unknown future.  I definitely wouldn't want any company to do that to me, but I think you have to be honest about it.<n>The truth of the matter is that "no one's going to get hurt by it" is not a very convincing selling point; even companies that are used to dealing with potential risks like to have plans in place for just in case one might happen.

The child agreed and, to his surprise, he was gay. The child’s father tried to convince him to change his mind by saying he thought he was a homosexual. The child was adamant and continued to say that he was gay. The father decided to get a divorce that he felt would be the best solution, which it was. The child later started using his father’s identity as him throughout his teen years. The father got custody of the child and left his wife, who became a lesbian as a result. The mother got custody of the child a few years later. The mother later decided to try again and started dating the father in high school. Despite all of the changes made, the mother kept a relationship going with the father throughout the years. The father told the mother that it was time to divorce, which he did. The child, knowing that he was gay, grew up into a very successful man who was very successful without the help of the father or the mother. In fact, he was successful because of them. Although he was gay, he was able to keep a healthy relationship with them.

You need your best eye for danger.  The other eye is for recognizing patterns. Together, both eyes make sense.<n>  The problem is, as people walk into the store, they do not see every possible danger and the patterns do not begin to match. We have a challenge: how do we create an eye that sees patterns that are not yet visible?  An eye that is not seen as looking for danger yet gets us to the point where we are confident in our ability to assess people.<n>  The answer is:  We do not have an eye that sees patterns yet.  We have an eye that sees the potential danger.   We create a system (a computer vision) that is able to detect threats in people's responses and actions.  The computer can recognize dangerous patterns of behavior.<n>  We are able to create an eye that can recognize patterns that are not yet seen and to recognize patterns that do not yet exist.<n>  Our work is already beginning.

I've been playing on Pokerstars for a long time.<n>I've been a member for over 6 years and I've made around 875 dollars from pokerstars so far.*<n><n>This game is pretty good. You start out with 4 cards. You play till 5, then switch to blackjack.<n>You can either buy chips or start earning chips with your cards. You earn by playing cards against the house, and you earn by buying chips.<n><n>The game only changes every minute, but the game is pretty fun anyway. I was surprised that the site was so big. I'm hoping to get in one night some time.<n><n>I like this game a lot. Its nice to play with your friends on pokerstars. Its not too long. Its kind of boring the first time, but it does get more varied.<n><n>The gameplay itself is quite slow, and it can be quite tiring after awhile. Maybe thats my problem with it.<n><n>So basically, this is more boring than other online poker games, but its a fun game. The game looks like it could be fun to play with friends. Also, if you play it on US servers, you'll probably get a better player count. For a free game, it is definately not bad. It is more complex than other free poker sites out there, and I do not recommend it.<n><n>The basic gameplay is exactly like a true card games variant, with the main difference that you can have up to 8 cards, although you can only have 4 of each card face-up. Players are dealt the same hand, and the dealer shuffles in the cards he throws at the starting hand.<n><n>You can either play against the dealer, or against a random opponent. Players can see each other's cards, but they can't see your cards. All cards are shuffled in the centre of the table, at random intervals during the game (at least I thought so), and each player keeps their own cards on the table, where they can see it. You can put any cards face-up, or keep them face-down. But the shuffling is not always random. During the first hour of playing, it takes a few hours on average for the players to learn how to play, and before that its very slow and boring. And when the players have a strong hand

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:I was shopping at a car dealership, what did a salesman do? Choices:  A: appear suddenly B: bottom out C: go downtown D: scream E: roll over<n>Output:		 6<n><n>Solution: It depends on what you mean by surprise and what you mean by the salesperson. If you mean he appeared suddenly he should have appeared on the screen quickly. If you mean he went to bottom out or go to downtown then a salesman going there would not surprise you, but an employee going there would surprise you.<n>I have seen this many times when it shows the sales person running into a room and then out the door very quickly, then the same salesman coming back from a very unexpected location that I do not expect.<n><n>What does the answer of choice A mean?<n><n>Tapanga<n><n>What does the first two options do?<n><n>A, in my case, I knew what was going to happen but still saw it in its shock value. C and D I do not understand them at all.<n><n>Answer: A is my answer because I have the same confusion as you.<n><n>Tapanga<n>What does the first option mean?<n>A: Do the salesperson "bottom out" or "top out" on the screen?<n>Both of these are wrong. What they are not wrong are the results. What is in the "bottom out" scenario has happened.<n><n>Tapanga and Corey have 66 total candies each. Both are playing "The Game" and both have 66 candies to their names, plus a 5% bonus. There were 64 candies between either of them. So 64 candies has already been divided between the two players and then Corey gets 10 (the percentage bonus) and Tapanga gets 5 (the bonus). Since 66 candies already had been divided, nothing more was added to either of them.<n><n>So by your answer choice A, there is one extra candy that you got because of the previous turn. But the answer choice gives the "bottom-out".<n><n>Corey<n>What is the answer choice?<n><n>Corey has 36+35-14. This is how many candies Corey has in his bag when he comes back. This does not surprise me since Corey has 4 and a 5% bonus when he has a full bag. This is the answer choice.<n><n>Pete<n>What is the answer?<n><n>Pete has a 10% bonus on his total candies. This is wrong because the answer choices is "37 plus 10" (6), "41 plus 11" (5), or "46 plus 13" (2). Those answers give the percentage bonus only if I put in the code

How many times should Tapanga use his super weapon?<n><n>Answer: 5 times in total.<n><n>Hint : Tapanga should use superweapon on himself in each level. Tapanga should use super weapon on the tree in level 8 if it is possible for you to save him from himself.<n><n>This next exercise is to find out how many candies tapanga has.<n><n>Answer: 33 candies<n><n>Hint : You will do the experiment where you tapanga and you will start to run around the town in the first level. Tapanga should start running with 3 candies so that you know the total candies he has. Tapanga should run one time with the super weapon at 6 candies and another time with his weapons at 11 candies. Tapanga should run ten times with the super weapon and 10 times with the weapons. Tapanga should keep running with the weapons until the total is at 11 or 16 candies. If you run in between those time points, you will have less than the time you need for your test. Tapanga should run the same sequence ten times and the exact same sequence ten times again. Tapanga should run each time to 9 candies and then 10 times to 10 candies. Every ten candy runs you start to get 10 more candies and every 10 candies you finish he gives you 20 candies.

Their teacher, however, will not be in on the conversation: "It's good that you like reading, but you seem to be spending a lot of time in that book." What do you suggest they do with the fact that they don't have the choice to say "I'm not in the mood"?<n>Output: 9<n><n>(I'm sorry if this isn't correct, didn't look through your answer.)<n><n>To be completely honest, I would advise you to put it in the right frame. The students won't know which answer to pick. The answer may read something like the following:<n><n>1) I am not in the mood to read, but the book is good. I want my teacher to read it to me.<n>OR<n>2) I am in the mood to read but I don't want to get all my homework done. I will read it in the next break.<n>OR<n>3) I am not in time for the class, so I will not read it today.<n><n>To be perfectly honest, I would advise *not* to put it in the frame. The students won’t know whether or not your answer is correct. All they really know is that you have given an indirect, indirect answer. They may choose an answer that’s “no”, but the way you have the answer written in your answer doesn’t help them to decide. All you can do is be as positive as you can.<n><n>But that doesn’t mean you should use only positive words and sentences. “Good” and “fine” don’t always mean good.<n>The answer that you gave can be as simple as this: Yes or No:<n><n>2) I am not in a good mood.<n><n>This gives the answer "Good". But it doesn't tell much about why.<n><n>You could say to your students, “I don’t believe that it’s a good mood if you won’t be able to finish, yet.” This gives them the answer "No".<n><n>Another way to give the answer is by saying, “That answers the question,” then write, “I will get the homework done during lunch.” This gives more information about why you don’t want the student to finish reading the

One is not built and there is only one way into the island. Both of these houses have rooms but there is a room you are not using. To build inside these houses, you will be constructing the structure for the house. First you will need to find an existing structure that is already built. Each house has a house of some kind that you can place a deck on top. You will then need to choose a location for this deck. When the deck arrives, place it on the roof of your house. It is time to construct the house of choice. There are two ways to do this. You can build both a kitchen and bathroom or only one bathroom.<n><n>First, you will need to build a room on the level below your deck. As you do this, the water level should not go higher than your deck. Once the room is built, it will be ready for construction of your second house. This is easy because the room is the same as the other house. You will then need four pieces of wood. Cut each piece of wood into four sections of equal length.<n><n>The first step in construction of both of your houses is to build walls. There are four walls in each house. They are the floors and roof of each house. Once this is done, you will need to construct stairs up to your second house. The bottom floor of your house will start out as the basement. Next you will place a staircase up into the ceiling to the second floor. At this point, you can just let your house sit there as a floating house until you do something with it.

Choices:  A: park B: make time for C: receive instructions D: take money E: leave work<n>Output:		 17<n><n>In the following sentences, the correct use of the word to indicates that you have used the verb to.<n><n>I know that the word to is used the same in each of the following sentences, but in each case, I am giving a different answer.<n><n>I took another look at the video, this is a problem that happens a few times in the video and it is a really common problem in the industry.<n><n>I see that the author is aware of the problem of taking drugs, but it appears as though she thinks the problem has been solved.<n><n>I would like to read more about the "unlikely" answer.

This answer made sense to him.<n><n>After I heard the response from the second question, I tried to figure out why he received the same instruction. The problem is, I didn't understand the story she fed me. After I watched the video again, I realized something. The video is based on what he thought she meant. After he completed the task, the question popped into his head.<n><n>I read the explanation, and since it seems that she fed us her ideas when she made the story in the game we should have been prepared.<n><n>We have learned that the meaning of a to has been used like two times in each of the following three sentences.<n><n>1. I read the answer, which means that you should be able to figure out what the answer is, but the rest of the sentence will be meaningless;<n><n>2. The answer seemed like a good idea, but I never understood what happened;<n><n>3. The answer seemed obvious, but I never realized that someone would not understand the rest of the sentence.<n><n>In this situation, if we read the answer word for word, all we would have to do is say "the correct answer is" to get the code to go to the dealer.

Choices:  A: television B: attic C: corner D: they cannot clean corner and library during football match they cannot need that E: ground<n>Output:		 24<n><n>You are able to win this test if you did as well as shown in the answer keys from last night's test. I do not have the test on hand but I recall the answer keys.  I've had no problems with this test but the last time I did one, all the answers I saw were wrong or just flat out wrong. So I'm hoping today's test stays just right.<n><n>How is it that people can get all the way up to a 60 on the test and still only get a 50?<n><n>How much do you really know how to do that's the same for all of us? I know more than some of the people here and I know very little.<n><n>I'll give a brief answer. The way it works is most people are going to answer based on a brief description of what's on the line. So for example, if the question said there are 10 people who are to be put inside each other for the duration of the test, if you read the first 5 items, you will know exactly how that should be done in each of those 5 items. The test is essentially that you're to give as many hints and tips as you possibly can and you'll still be able to answer the questions fairly clearly.<n><n>This is a tough one to answer for quite a few reasons. It's not a 100% accurate way to answer these type of questions as it's based on a person's experience with the game they're playing. So the answer is going to be "You'll know". I don't know about this, but I know how much my Mom does. She's pretty good at it. So you might want to just figure it out by following the answer key questions.<n><n>It's not the easiest thing in the world to pick out all the clues correctly in the given puzzle. In this regard the question just doesn't say who is inside which means when people have a blank space you must assume the person inside is correct. So if they had the same color or shape they should be in your mind. You can get pretty creative with it, but you should be able to see that they are inside your mind.<n><n>I guess the best way to answer it honestly is you want to be able to answer the whole set before you are done. I did this last night before I came online and got about 75% correct. After that I was pretty much done and knew exactly I knew and no more questions were needed. I would like to say I

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:What is the only was to recover from exhaustion? Choices:  A: mediate B: have rest C: stay in bed D: run out of steam E: go to sleep<n>Output:		 29<n>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n><n>I like the second question.. it's actually sort of like the first one but with a word. You want me to choose what to do. As for the others.. how? The problem is finding out what is going on. That's the beauty of the questions.. because you don't really want something..<n><n>i am having a difficulty understanding the question.i am getting a 25 right now. i think the answer is the one that has no option? the one with the most amount candy? the one with the least amount candy? the second candy is too much! or is it too little! how much candy!? and why is it a first place! it should be last place! and the last option has no candy at all… how can i remember that?!?!?<n><n>Answer: When you have 66 candies, you have enough to do a double candy and the two would have two more candies each. And if you have 8 candies and it's just a double candy, the last candy would be 15 candies if it had 6 candies, 7 in a double candy and no more. You also have to take into account that one candy can have the name of three candies because when you look at the first option that has 3 candies, that option tells you that they both have 6 candies.<n><n>So let's say you had 50 candies in the game. You would choose the 1st option because you have 66 candies and then you have 50 candies. It's also because it will get you 50 candies. But here's the problem you'd run out of candies. You'd need to look up what you have in your hands and you would run out of candies because the amount of candies isn't enough.<n><n>The best solution I usually make with a lot of candies is to either meditate or wait for a double candy to come along. Usually, meditating will do the trick but even so you will rarely use it cause it leaves you with less candy that you need..

"What is Florida?" isn't a question, it's a statement that the question is not answered. The sentence structure is not right.<n><n>The question is about "What is Florida?" and "How many candies does Corey had"? It's not about US vs. Canada.<n><n>I don't believe I ever said "map" was a valid answer.<n><n>"map" is the answer.<n><n>It's not supposed to be a correct statement.<n><n>It's also different from: "What is Florida?".<n><n>It's not a valid answer.<n>There aren't any questions in any of the answers,<n>and it is in fact a statement.

Even if an answer was "Map" then I would still think it's a mistake because it wouldn't add anything to the answer.

You don’t actually have to give up anything, only part of anything. You and I both understand the first step of the great awakening.<n>2. If you give up two things from your life that do not relate to the great awakening then it is like a dead end. It gives up the door, the key or the secret. But one can do without.<n>3. If you do give up two things then it is a great experience and you are one-step closer to the great awakening.<n>4. If you give up something to the great awakening then you are part of it. Then your connection to everything in the universe is stronger and you are more connected to yourself.<n>5. When you give something up to the great awakening then nothing can take it away from you again and again and again.<n>6. When you give something to the great awakening, or the door (the secret), it is always there to give it back.<n>7. When the door (the secret) is not there for you to give something to it, like when you have no money, or no food, or no house, then you have no place any more. The door is always there to give something back.<n>8. It doesn't matter if you give something to the door (the secret). It doesn't even matter if you give up your house. If you give it something else, than you are making an oath to give your house back to whatever you want to make an oath to.<n><n>You are about ready to learn that if you give up your second car, your second house, your second child, your second dog, your second job and second everything then the door (the secret)+your house will be your gift to yourself.<n><n>The secret (the door)+your house doesn't go away. It comes back. Now you can’t be happy without it. Now you can‘t make it without what you’ve given it. Now you are free to make choices for yourself, making choices that you had before, but you don’t have to anymore. That’s right. You are free to choose what you want to make your life about. That’s amazing!<n><n>That is the secret of the great awakening: give
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:What could listening to music cause you to be? Choices:  A: happy B: smile C: calm D: entertainment E: relaxation<n>Output:		 28<n><n>The first option is "happy", the second is "smile" the third is "calm" and the final answer is "entertainment". This one's not too difficult<n><n>The answer is "happy".<n><n>I'm sorry for posting this a little later than you'd all like but I've been super sick. If you're having trouble solving this problem then I recommend taking a break, take a hot bath, some deep sea swimming, or whatever relaxing hobby you like. Just try to unwind and recover in a way. It really helped me.<n><n>In response to your question about the answer, I think the answer is "happy". It's a happy situation where you and Corey are both interested in listening to music. You don't have to worry about your music getting stuck in your head or anything like that. If you're not looking at their phones they probably have something else they're doing that might interfere with the music or the song if it's an audio book.<n><n>This is a good example of another reason I really like tapenafil, since you're giving them a lot of positive responses when they're making the right choices. If you get them to just use their phones but make them do something constructive during listening time then you'll get really nice mood boost.

She saw a man walking towards her on the path. She saw an opportunity to run and ran towards the guy and told him to "leave her alone." He said his name was "Mike" and he "wanted to do a favor for her." Tapanga asked Mike to give her the candy he had picked up from the man. Mike said that he would give Tapanga everything that he had. When Tapanga thanked him and took the candy, Mike hit her in the head with an ice pick. He ran off leaving Mike and Tapanga bleeding. Tapanga said she would find him. Then, another man came out from behind the playground and hit Mike square in the head with a ball (the ice pick). Mike fell to the ground and passed out. Tapanga called 911. She left her children alone at the playground and ran into the playground to find Mike and help him. The children were crying so Tapanga carried them back to their house and gave them the ice pick that Mike had given her. A few hours later, a nurse came to their house for help. The nurse took the kids to the ER and got some medical attention for Mike while Tapanga and the nurse talked to each other. The nurse told Tapanga that Mike had attacked Tapanga and was also attacking another woman from the group that they had just had a conversation with. Mike said he had done nothing wrong. He asked the nurse to tell Tapanga that he was her husband. After this tapanga left the room. As the nurse was getting Mike out of the car, Mike picked up his phone and called 911. He then said he wanted to leave the country for his family. The nurse told him that she would have to call the police so that they wouldn't report Mike as a missing person while he was in the US and he could stay with her until he was arrested. The nurse then told Mike that she wanted to report him as a missing person in the US because she thought he was going to try and do a thing to harm himself in the US. One month later, Mike was released from jail. Then he came to the US and stayed with Tapanga in New York. Tapanga took care of him for a few years until he came to the US about 2 years ago. After some time the US police asked Tapanga if she could help them find Mike. To this day she still hasn't seen Mike or talked to him.<n><n>Answers:<n>

When she's done, take the pair with the least number of wool and count its numbers. Ask her to turn up the numbers with her fingers, so you can hear where she's coming from.<n>Then let's look at what really matters -- does your child know how to use a tape measure correctly? Does she know what a minute is? Does she know to start from a certain point? Does she know the circumference of a circle? Does she know how to find the length of an ellipse, and in which direction? Does she know how far apart the numbers on a piece of paper measure? Can she find two different lengths of circle with the same amount of wool?<n><n>The important thing with all of this is for your child to learn that learning is FUN!! If your student doesn't learn how to solve problems via play, they'll never get motivated and it'll be harder for them to learn because they won't learn by doing the activities as playtime -- they'll get to school and tell you "I didn't learn anything today" and

Answer the following multiple choice question with choices to the right of the answers.<n>Response: You use the following two strategies for victory:  A) win the game using the strategy of cards. This has the maximum payoff. By using a strategy that relies on strategy cards, you can play a game that is less frustrating -- it might take longer, but can be achieved. After winning the game using cards, if you have enough cards, you can try another strategy to win the game. To win the game, when you have the maximum outcome for the best strategy, you can choose one of the cards to win the game -- they call it the “victory jackpot.” That strategy has the lowest payoff but increases your overall chance of winning the game. In the next round, if you win a victory jackpot, you have not lost. The game has a second victory jackpot the same size as the first one. Use this strategy in place of the most powerful strategy. Play a game that is easy to win, but is unlikely to win the game for you. Do your best, and if you are not winning, you will improve! This strategy has the lowest payoff and is most likely to fail. However, you increase your odds of winning by playing this strategy. Don’t try to beat an inferior strategy. You can’t beat a strategy that is impossible to beat. This strategy has the highest payoff. If you play a game that has a very small payoff, it is highly likely that the next round isn’t going to be worth while, and you’ll have to go back to using a strategy with a smaller payoff. In order to play this strategy: Be sure to draw a card with a very small payoff, like 3 or 6 points. Then, draw a card with a high payoff -- like a 25 point jackpot. Then, play a game where it is possible for you to win the game using the low payoff strategy. Be sure to draw cards with good payoff.<n>Output: 25<n><n>input:The three most common responses to the question

Choices:  A: get hungry B: laughter C: injury D: having fun E: feeling happy<n>Output:		 9<n><n>input and I have not been together for 3 months. I decided to see her at a social outing. At first we spent the evening laughing and smiling our way through the evening, before settling in bed to watch a movie. After the movie there was much laughing and some kissing. At some point during the movie it was decided we should go to the bathroom. We did not go to the bathroom, as we did not have time. As a result I woke up without any clothes to the room I shared with her. I felt guilty and decided to make it up to her by bringing her a nice lunch. At first she seemed happy after I gave her a nice lunch. However, after a while she became angry and told me she was not interested in me any longer. I then realised the only way to resolve the situation was to go into my room. My bedroom is fairly private because it is my room. I did not have any clothes on and had no way of hiding which was why I got in the bathroom. When I returned into the bathroom where I had been, I could hear a door in the bathroom open, and another in my room. I tried to cover myself in case anyone was watching the door when I left the bathroom. While hiding the clothes I had been wearing did not go unnoticed, I was unaware of the fact that someone was still watching the door when I returned. After I had covered myself in order to stop the others seeing me, I could not help hearing footsteps approaching my room. I went back to my room and hid the other clothes I had been wearing. There was no way of knowing when this was going to happen and I was extremely afraid of being caught. What was my best chance of avoiding this?<n>Input: 1. Hide in my room 2. Hide in my room if someone was watching the door. 3. Try to stay out of the house for now (at least until my house mate told me they had come home and I could leave.) 4. Ask the person I was having a problem with to call a truce.<n>Output: I had to try option 1.

Choices:  A: train station B: bookstore C: newsstand D: waiting room E: airport<n>Output:		 A<n><n>Do not post any non-standard questions here. Ask your question in the sticky thread and then reply in your main thread.<n><n>My question is:What happens when a person is not happy about something he didn’t do when he/she was in the wrong?<n><n>For example, I have just received two messages this morning and they both say something like, “I messed up.”<n><n>But I didn’t mess up. There was no mistake; I took the liberty to ask him out for dinner after getting off the elevator, knowing him only by looking at his cell phone.<n><n>However, I didn’t do something I was not happy with. I’m the one who messed up!<n><n>The best answer is, “It’s not your responsibility. It’s his/her responsibility. You are free to go.”<n><n>If you think you have made a mistake, then call the person and try to figure it out with that person. The person in the wrong is human. But the mistake he/she made is not his/her fault and it has nothing to do with you. You must not feel bad about it and take it easy. Otherwise, stress and worry will ruin your day.<n><n>Sometimes we say that we will regret something and how we feel when we regret something never happen.<n><n>So even if our first message is bad, we will not regret the second one.<n><n>If you are still not sure, you can take your message to send it again.<n><n>On a note, just because you mess up, it does not mean that you will always be the guy who will never be in trouble. There will be a time when you will be in trouble. But you will be the one that never miss the opportunity to do something good.<n><n>In your message to him, you said, “I am sorry if this has happened to you twice.”<n><n>Good for you. Let’s say that you get asked out for dinner one next day, how will you feel about that?<n><n>Will you be relaxed and happy when you saw his face?<n><n>If that was you, you were too much afraid to be like that.<n><n>If you were asked to buy beer after your first message to him, you need to be more open and not say anything negative and be yourself. Because that makes sure you will not run into any problems

Choices:  A: original B: old C: coke clear D: former E: familiar<n>Output:		 29<n>A-C-D-E-F<n><n>Answer: C.<n>Before New Coke was discontinued there was an all new formula of Coke. This coke with a different name was discontinued after the Coke Classic was launched. This coke was made with sugar syrup and contained 0 calories. It also contained a lot of nutrients because it was made with real sugar and there was no added sugar. Coca Cola Classic was launched around the same time New Coke was discontinued making it popular.<n>Coke Clear was the original Coke that was discontinued. Coke Clear was made with sugar syrup but it was a different coke that didn’t have any calories. It also had a natural sweetening agent in it called dextrose. This coke became popular because it was a natural coke that didn”t contain artificial flavoring. The other coke’s coke’s natural sweetener was dextrose but it wasn’t in any of Cokes flavors. So Cokes natural sugar was added to make Cokes flavor more palatable.<n>Coke Classic had a similar formula as New Coke but it only contained no calories. It has an artificial sweetener called aspartame but the amount of aspartame is tiny. It was discontinued when Cokes soft drink formula changed.<n>New Coke had a similar formula as classic but it was discontinued after Cokes soft drink formula was changed. New Coke was discontinued when Cokes formula changed because New Coke didn’t have a natural sweetener in it. It had high sodium content and added dextrose to add a sweetness flavor to it.<n>Coke Clear had a similar formula as old Coke but it was discontinued after the recipe was changed. Coke Clear just had the same sweetener as the other coke’ s coke. Coca Colas formula changed in 2005 when the coke had a natural sugar aspartame and it had no added soda water flavors. Coke’s new formula also had a natural sweetener in the coke, dextrose.<n><n>Output: 4.<n>Answer: D<n>Both A-C-D-F are correct. However, the amount of caffeine in Vanilla and Cherry is so small that it would really not matter. Vanilla has 4.3% caffeine and Cherry has only 3.3% so this would be a close finish. As long as you get the answer right you’re good to go.<n><n>A couple notes:<n>In math

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:What would a person expect if they are competent in their school work? Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n>Output:		 25<n><n>Taken as a whole, it would be difficult for an incompetent student to pass. A "passing" grade would not be very encouraging if the student was really struggling.<n><n>The teacher should really be more concerned about individual performance and if the student is struggling.<n><n>How would their parents react if they were to find out that their child wasn't doing well at school, but that the student was still good-to-excellent at the sports they participate in?<n><n>If your child is struggling, it would be best to try to contact the parents. You might tell them that their child's school behavior makes you nervous and that trying to change him/her would not really work. I would also suggest that you check in with the teacher about the progress you are seeing. I think it might be better for your child's emotional well-being to see you and the teacher at any point. It might make the teacher more sure of which approach would work best for the child. As the parent of a student who is struggling a great deal with her academics, I'd like to say that I would like to talk to the teacher. But not too long after I mentioned that, I'd start getting really irritated about that, and wonder if the teacher was trying to change my child by trying to get them to do something that would get them less stressed. I'd also feel that maybe she was just doing this to get my kid to do something she thought would work as an attempt to help get my kid's behavior in line. This might be a pretty common reaction though.<n><n>I like it but I think that they need to be more aware of individual differences, like a child with Asperger's may have a certain type of communication style or may perform better in some kinds of school environments. Just a thought....<n><n>Well, in my own experiences, they will not know that they are doing that if they are truly being good children. But we can't be too careful, especially because we hear that many parents say this.

While waiting for them, a man asked the girl if she wanted to swim, in which swimsuit she should wear. The girl said, "I will wear the yellow swimsuit." The man said, "Can I swim with you?" The girl said, "Yes." The man said, “Do you want to take a swim? I will swim in the blue swimsuit, where shall I swim?”<n>The girl said, “I am not the only one who enjoys swimming, I will swim with you and you with me.”<n>The man said, “I will swim in the same swimsuit as you.”<n>The girl thought of changing swimsuits, but decided not to do it.

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n>Output:		 3<n><n>The last one is just to make sure you get the concept right.<n><n>I apologize I wasn't more specific as to what inflation is and what does it cause.<n>I have to assume it refers to "inflation" as it is a form of a "price" correct?<n><n>Inflation is the price of all the objects being produced today.<n><n>Price is the cost of the products<n>Inflation is the cost of all the objects being made in the supply today<n>Inflation is a way to get rid of money for products in the future<n>All of this is to keep more money in circulation in the world. So, there would still be money as far as I know.<n>As far as products not being noticed, that must be due to the fact that items are so hard to find. The world would not see the need to make things more expensive thus reducing the need for it to happen.<n><n>I apologize for my ignorance of this subject. I just can't figure it out.<n><n>The above is what makes all of this so hard to figure out.<n><n>Well, at least you said you didn't think it was worth my time to try getting into this further.<n><n>The problem is that every time you add another dollar to a product to make it more expensive, there is another dollar worth of things that are cheaper now. In other words, the supply of money is never going to cease. It will always increase.<n>So, that means that as time goes on, goods that are priced at a fixed dollar will eventually be able to be produced and they will begin to be just as valuable. And then, over time, the price of those goods will begin to rise like the price of money.<n>And you are right, there would be no reason because there will always be more products now being produced and eventually there will be no difference in the value of money between money being paid for goods and money paying for goods. You can always use currency to make trade between people. That is another form of money.<n><n>Ok, that's interesting. So, the price of money is an infinite amount. This is different from the problem I posed in the original posting.<n><n>So, for example, let's say you add a dollar to the price of milk. Now when you sell milk to someone else they can now buy milk for a dollar so long as they have at least one dollar. But if they only have a dollar now no matter how many dollars

Choices:  A: fall asleep B: headache C: boredom D: relaxation E: sick<n>Output:		 9<n><n>1 Answer<n>1<n><n>The answer is 29 (based on the number of candies each has). What makes this so simple? You only need to look at the number "8" and multiply by six. Here comes the interesting part though. On one hand, the answer for "a" is correct (you went to the opera!). On the other, the answer for "d" is incorrect. (It means you are not thinking very clearly -- so do not attempt to answer this question using logic.)<n><n>As far as the other answer is concerned, if you answer "B" then you are falling asleep. As you probably guessed, you do not fall asleep if the opera is boring. This brings us to the next question: Is the opera boring? Again, we have to look at number "8".<n><n>The answer to your first question is obviously "F" (the opera is not boring). But you know this. That is why the answer for "d", no matter how right or wrong it is, you will feel the same way, as you are not thinking clearly. You are just getting tired or sleepy, and that is why you are falling asleep. It is not that the opera actually is boring, but it sounds like they are taking a lot of time and effort to perform this.<n><n>So let us look at number "9" and how you will do if you are tired or sleepy. You will fall asleep. Your eyes will close and you will not be able to see the lights. There would be no music or singing (but some may still play), but there would be no way to relax.<n><n>But there is another way of thinking about this question. There is one thing that makes the opera interesting -- the setting.<n><n>You see, we live in a culture where we are not happy unless we can sit and watch someone else suffer. Or better yet, we may enjoy watching somebody else suffer.<n><n>Many are aware of the saying that many lives have been saved because somebody went into a restaurant and asked for bread.<n><n>Now this may seem like a really minor difference. Bread is just a food item. But think about the effect this could have on somebody's life.<n><n>Bread saved a life. Imagine for a moment, you are suffering from a disease. You have no way of fighting the illness, and you know that you will die. But you could eat that very stale bread. Would you survive the illness? Even if you could

Otherwise, you will just be making all these changes over and over again).<n><n>## Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n>Input:What's this? a "happy face" or a "heart"<n>Output: 1<n><n>input: How many of this are there? 2, 5, 10<n>output: 1<n><n>The program asks for a count each time the input is given. If you're just counting from 1-10 (not counting the ones I guess you would), it should be possible to do this with either the original question or a couple of different questions asking where people might go, but at least you know which one the program's answers are taking. Also, for each person you give a list of other people they should be able to get a count of how many more those other people have.<n><n>The "number of these" question is an odd one as there are no right answers here. What I think you should do is use the "count" word on each answer to the first question. Then again, you may be able to do this with just giving them answers in a text string but that probably won't be very readable. You'll just be left with long blocks of text.<n><n>To make the numbers go more quickly you need to break things up a little. There are also things like "on" and "off" buttons, depending on the program you are using. In TextEdit you just click on the "count" and click "next" or something like that.

It is not loud and there is no smell of alcohol emanating from their mouths. The second car is very noisy, and you have to look out of your back window to see who inside of it is driving. You see the two women sitting on one side of the second car. One of them is wearing white high-heeled shoes that are ripped at the bottom. You think to yourself, “She is probably pregnant. She needs to get those fixed.” You quickly get out of the car, and see that she is holding a baby and is wearing the same shoes. You quickly walk to the first car, and get out of the way so that she can go the passenger’s side. The passenger’s window is down, but you have to stick your head in to see it. She puts her head down and the window is down again. You can almost smell alcohol that is coming out of her mouth when she opens it. You see what looks like a newborn baby wrapped in a blanket. You have to pull back your hair to see most of it. She looks like she is drunk. You do not know if she is pregnant or not. You could think something like, “She has a child with her boyfriend. He should get them fixed before he gives birth. She needs to be taking care of that, not getting drunk every night.” You could think something like this about 2,000 times over throughout the day.<n><n>Example:<n>You and your husband are listening to the radio together

What the heck are you doing?”<n><n>The woman in the pink shirt then takes him down the toilet, down the hall

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:Why might a person take a vacation? Choices:  A: relaxation B: good things in life C: admiration D: own house E: needs money<n>Output:		 28<n><n>Answer: Choice B has the most practical answer because some people have more than they need, and some don't. Choice C has the most romantic answer because it will be hard to leave all those friends behind (for many people). Choice C has the most scientific answer because it is a question of economics. And Choice D is the most interesting answer because it is the only question about human nature. There are different ways of looking at these choices. You could say it's a rational choice if A is for the most practical reasons. You could say it is in her best interest because of her need for cash. You could say it goes against her moral code because she does not love her friend that way (I'm guessing that "familiar" is a strong word).<n><n>### Instruction:Enter a link to an online course you would be willing to take along with this assessment.

The player with the highest score wins $10,000 while they both make $6,000. The players also split the jackpot coin 50/50. The player with the most score is called the first player. The second player is selected as the second player. The players then each take turns getting two coins, two Jack Pot, and then one Jackpot. The player with the third lowest score is the last to take turns, then if he gets all three coins, his score is $18,000 instead of $18,000. This player, however, has received only the one Jackpot coin so the score would be $16,000 instead of $16,000. If this player had received the third coin, he would win, but he would only get $1,000 for his win. A coin or three coins is a jackpot. The player should receive one coin, two coins, or three coins for their win. The player should make one coin for his own score and the score of every player in the tournament. If both the players would receive the same coin, the third player would make $8500 instead of $8,000. If the players would receive two coins, the third player would get $3,500, while the two other players would each get $1,000. The fourth player

I hope to upload a new revision on this thread of the question in an hour or 2).<n><n>My sister got a question like this on Facebook about a year ago<n><n>"Do you get a better grade at a school if you have more than 1 friend with the same last name?"<n><n>I thought it would be cool to do this as it's such an important subject/issue with the question.<n><n>I'm not a math teacher, but I used to work in an elementary school and it's actually a very good question.<n><n>The answer I thought was right was "yes" because you get better grades and maybe even extra credit if you have more friends with the same last name than the other kids in the class. But there's also one other possible answer worth mentioning:<n><n>You should have more friends with the last name than your name. So if you have 12 friends with the first name of Smith but only 9 friends with the last name Smith, you should end up with the 9 Smiths, plus 8 more if you had 6 additional Smiths.<n>But it can't be that way. So you're really "half" right. Not that I'm much of a teacher or anything...<n><n>I thought it was interesting that her friends weren't necessarily the 9 Smith kids, even though she already had 3 Smiths on her own. So I thought since kids tend to have other siblings in small numbers, it could be possible that they have other siblings as well, which is why having one friend with the same last-name as the rest of the kids won't work.<n><n>You get more credits for having a friend with the same last first last if it is the same for them, not necessarily for the whole class as it should be for most people.<n><n>What I learned from this story is a lesson that would apply to this question.<n><n>I like the idea with the first name being the same as yours. I would add that the teacher would probably expect more than one or two friend's with a last name to have the same first name. This could be a problem for some people.<n><n>I'm going to add a little personal perspective when my time comes to do this.<n>For me, it was a hard lesson when my little sister had to take her final in middle school.<n>She had an older sister, and she was a "popular" kid in school, yet I

If you answer "2" or "5" for each question, then the answer for every question will be the same. To find out how much the answer for each question has, find out the answers for each question, add the total and multiply it by 2, 3 or (if you do not know that method) by 5.

James was probably going to win this no matter what else happened. If he quit during this step, he would have probably won anyways, even if he would have been "pressure-free" throughout the remainder of the game<n>B: Death. If James doesn't quit, he might still win.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:If I am forgiving, what hidden force may be activated in my life? Choices:  A: nice feeling B: good karma C: respect D: new freedom E: good heart<n>Output:		 29<n>In the case of forgiveness, an unknown force is present, one that requires our attention and understanding in order to avoid being triggered by.<n>Also, in our lives, different forces have the ability to trigger the kind of feelings and emotions that need to be dealt with, sometimes through forgiveness, but sometimes through self-restraint, or even fear or caution. You just have to find the right force(s) when necessary, and use it wisely.<n><n>In this way, you are able to be completely present in all moments, and the more your heart knows about the people in your life, the more comfortable you are about being vulnerable with them. This in turn, makes your friends and family more willing to open themselves up to your presence. (I am not saying this has to be a 100% good thing, but it is always good to have something to keep in mind)<n>You, in turn, have to develop the wisdom to know when you are fully in your present moment(s) and you don't need to worry about the future, which may have its own challenges, and the past being something that may be useful to be reminded of and learned from, but often will not be something that is to be cherished or held accountable to very long. But that is also a separate, separate conversation, for another day. Just for today, be grateful for each moment that you are here.<n><n>In fact, when you find yourself in a situation where you are feeling angry, depressed, fearful or even afraid, you can find ways to use the hidden force(s) in your life. Forgiveness/remorse and courage as well as mindfulness. Maybe you need to become the stronger and wiser person by stepping outside the box you are in, but if you don't have to do that for a specific reason, and it is not necessary for you, you are doing one of the things above that is helping.<n><n>And of course, as a last resort, you can do a powerful yoga pose or exercise of some kind to release the pain as well.<n><n>This kind of thing will never mean that no further harm can ever be suffered. But it is a very positive first step towards healing, and a more honest conversation between you and the force that is acting against you.<n><n>You can also write yourself down, if that is more available for you. Sometimes the answers are right there in your mind. Be sure to pay attention to any emotional and physical reactions you receive, as being connected

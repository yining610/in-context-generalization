The furnace heats the house during the day and electricity keeps the house lit at night.  The house is heated and cooled by wood.  As the days get older and the temperature gets colder, the temperature in the house falls and that is why he puts blankets and newspapers on his wooden floors.  On a recent day, his power ran out for almost half the time he slept in the house because of a problem with a gas line.  He decided to heat the house by burning wood every day until the power comes back on.  At first, he did not have enough wood to heat the house but eventually he had enough to heat it using only the fire.  However, he decided to also cook on the fire, heating up the fire with charcoal.  Before going to bed one night, Michael found that the fire was black due to the charcoal used in the fire.  Michael wondered if the charcoal was being properly cleaned before he used it again, so he decided to use the charcoal to light candles instead.  When he got back to bed in the morning, the house was just as dark as when he'd arrived the night before.  He was worried that the candles were going to burn out.  But then he realized that he'd used another new firewood, but rather than cleaning it, he set fire to it!  So Michael became very worried as to whether there would be more charcoal left for him the next day.  But this time, he decided to set fire to the rest of the wood he had already collected.  This time, instead of cleaning the firewood, he used it as a source of heat!  This time, the firewood had not burned out but the fire was still black.  Michael began to think that lighting any fires was bad luck.  When he tried lighting a fire with nothing but matches to light it with, the firewood burned dry faster.  So Michael decided that he was going to set fire to the wood left over the next day.  He decided to use the wood collected from the previous day and keep his fire burning for several days.

The rental rate for the house is $700.00.  When the client makes the payment, they are given 20% of the fee as an advance. The other 80% is due at check-out. If the client pays them at the time of reservation they are unable to rent the house. What would be the appropriate payment schedule for the house owner?\nOutput: If they pay 20% out of the check on booking the rental, the check should clear at check-out.\nIf they pay 80% at check-out, then they are not renting the house but are making a loan on it to pay for the other 80%.\nSo the final answer would be $700.00/$1,000.00 = =<<700.00\u00d72000.00=12>>12500.00\nTo ensure that their payment was $1200.00, the total payment would be 1200.00\u00d7500.00*200.00 = <<1200.00\u00d7500.25=28>>28500.00\nIn this case the client has a gross payment of 1200.00$\nSo the total for payment is:\n1200.00-1000.00 = $560.50\n\nInput:The net income for the year is $50,000.

{"text": "Listening is a skill that is important for any conversation to be successful.\nBut how is listening related to empathy, anxiety, and knowledge?\nFirst, empathy is the desire to feel understood by someone else.  Everyone experiences a sense of empathy and the desire to feel understood.  In a conversation it can be challenging to get past those barriers, especially when it becomes increasingly more difficult to get across.  But empathy comes with the understanding that what someone is experiencing is their struggle as much as your struggle.  Another example of an understanding is the student who is a good listener but struggles to learn a topic.\nSecond, anxiety is about trying to put oneself in someone else\u2019s place.  The student feels bad about doing something that the teacher dislikes and takes action to change it.  But there is only so much time or attention in the classroom to explain things or to talk about a topic and students often have to make quick decisions about how they want to handle a situation.  Also, when an anxiety about doing something or not doing something arises, it is often caused by something else, either related to the subject of the conversation or to the person involved.  This can lead the student to thinking they have to do something they find unpleasant.  This sort of thinking about an action can increase the anxiety level to a critical point, causing the student to hesitate and making the situation even worse, depending on how they respond and what they choose to do.  When the student decides to do something that causes anxiety, or when they choose not to do something, it is often because there is a lot of stress in the student\u2019s life, which the student tries to hide.  Knowing someone well or feeling safe with them can help students to learn to focus on the situation without allowing their anxiety to run it ragged.  Finally, third, knowledge is the ability to apply our understanding.\nNow, listening skills are important and being able to have a good conversation without getting lost or forgetting something is required for being able to think creatively or develop new ideas.\nBut it is important to be aware of what is behind this and how to recognize its source.  Anxiety and anxiety can be triggered by a feeling that the other person isn\u2019t in control of their own actions, isn\u2019t making rational decisions, or isn\u2019t as intelligent or as good-looking as you are.\nAt that point, it is likely that what you are describing is anxiety.  Anxiety is a strong emotion", "answer": "C: knowlege"}

So each 12-hour shift, the intern is given 4 12-hour shifts.\nThus, 2.5 12-hour shifts for the intern and 24 hours for the specialist per month result in an average of 5 12-hour shifts.  But, to keep things simple, each 12-hour shift is a half hour for the hospital doctor and 2.5 hours for each of the 2 specialists.

On a Sunday, it goes from the hospital for 40 miles to take his wife home.  What does the driver typically take home?\nOutput: In order to receive a raise in his paycheck, the driver needs to drive 2 hours in each direction.\nTherefore, driving 40 miles on a Sunday will require driving 2>40 miles on a Saturday.\nThus, from the combined mileage of the two roads taken, 2>40 miles = <2>2=40<2>40 miles.\nThe total driving time is 40*2=<<2*2=1>>2 hours\nSo in total, he needs to drive 2>40 hours on a Saturday and a Sunday of 2 hours each.\nSo the final number is 4 hours\n\nInput: Three people are in a group of 8: 6 men and 3 women, and 3 of the women are married and have children.

What type of car did Jack rent?\nOutput: The type he rented was a small, silver four-door station wagon.  Its trunk held five gallons of gas along with a gas canister for holding 3 gallons of gas.\nSince there was only 5 gallons of gas in the trunk and since the gas canister only held 3 gallons, the car had 5 gallons in the tank.\nSo the amount of gas in the tank was 5*3=<<5*3=12>>12\nThus, the total amount of gas in the car was 12 * 3=$3=$3.50\nThus, 3.50*3=$12=$3.50\nAs a result, $3.50 * 3=$12=$12=$40.00\nSo the total of $40.00 was $40.00*3=$12=$40.50\nThus, $40.00 was >$40.00*3=>>$40.00/40.00=2.50\nSo $2.50/40.00 was 2.50 times $40.00=>>>>2.50\u00d7$40.00\nThe final answer is 2.50>$2.50>$2=>>2>2>2>$10.00=<<10>10<10>10\nSo $10.00 was the final answer (a total of $10.00 for 5 gallons of gas)\nSo the total of =<<10>$10<10>$10=>>10 = $10.00\nThus, $10.00 was >$10.00*3=>$10.00/10.00=$40.00/100.00\nThus, 40.00/100.0 was $40.00/2.50 which was $40.00 * 4=>$40.00/2=>$40.00 per day\nThus, $40,00 per day was $40.00 per day => $40.00/50=> $40.00/200=> $40.00 per week\nSubtract 50% of this total amount from the total amount of income to see how much is left.\nThe total income for week was $20.00", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

The global population is only 2.9 billion.  So water on earth is 0.3 square meters squared / million meters of water.  At what rate does water flow around the earth?\nOutput: If water flows 1 meter every second, it takes 2.9 million years for 6\u00d7107 meters of water to drain out of the earth and flow into the oceans.\nSince our oceans are 4\u00d7107 meters squared / billion meters, we only have to wait for 30 billion years (34\u00d7103 meters squared / million meters) to discharge 2.9\u00d7107 meters of water into the water on earth.  So since the rate at which we discharge this water is 0.3 meters squared / million meters per day, it will take 3.23 million years for 1 square meter of water * 63,100 x 1.3 meters squared / billion meters = 6.64\u00d71032 inches of water to flow through the earth!\nSo there is a very short period of time required to discharge 6\u00d7107 meters of earth into the oceans!\n\nInput:The company owned a company, which had a stock index of 8.

A $10,000 grant was awarded from a foundation to a local business which, in turn, will employ ten employees.  The city has a budget of $8 million and a population of 150,000 people. The total investment for this project is $20,000.  How much will the county benefit from the grant?\nOutput: Based upon what was stated, the budget is $8 million, but the initial investment of $20,000 was not included.\nTaking into account the total investment of $20, it means that the benefit of the investment will be $20 * 3 * ($8 + $20) = $38,541\nThus on June 29, 1999, the city receives a $40,000 grant * 3 * ($8 * $20) = $68,541\nThis results in an increase in the total investment to $16,541\nSo the final answer will be $68,541 + $16,541 = 135,581\n\nInput: In the year 2012, a new department is formed in the college of business.

Approximately 50% of that damage occurred with drought related fires in 2003 and 2005 alone. Trees that were killed due to drought may never recover. What is the most likely scenario with regard to rebuilding those trees\u2019 root systems?\nOutput: Billions of trees that were damaged in the past two years have been regrown by replanting the damaged forest fragments, but not necessarily in the same shape and position as the original tree.  Tree root systems are very fragile and could be permanently damaged if the tree root structure is lost due to drought or fire.  However, if the entire root system is killed, it may take 1,000 years for the replanted tree to recover to its original shape and location.

How much could John afford to pay?\nOutput: John wants to pay $50,000 for a house, $35,000 for the car, and $10,000 for the boat.\nHis monthly payment would be: $35,000*50=<<35,000+10,000=$150,000\nHis total monthly payment would be: <<150,000+10, 000=270,000>>270,000\nAnd as a result of the loan, he would have a loan balance of $270,000.\nSo after subtracting $15,000 from his monthly check, John\u2019s loan balance would be: $170,000\nSo John would have $40,000 in cash after making his monthly savings plus the loan balance plus the new money from his new job, and he\u2019s in a much better place financially.\nSo the final amount that John would have in cash after buying his a house and purchasing his own boat is $150,918.87\nSo his total savings would be $145,918.87 after making his savings plus paying off his car plus paying off his boat\nHe would have about $20,000 to put toward the boat and $20,000 to pay off the house. So he would have around $37,000 left over!\nSo his total savings will be: $137,918.87+$37,000=$187,918.87 or ~$185,000 to put toward owning a boat and $15,000 to pay off his home and car.\n\nInput: Alice wants a new apartment that she can afford.

Students should be interested in the English language as an asset and not only an instrument for communication and work related purposes.\nInput: What questions do students need to answer in order to learn something?\nOutput: C is 100% right.

A flower would be a beautiful addition to a flower garden.\nOutput: A rose plant + Rose Garden + Rose pot > Rose Plant + Flower Garden\nThe next question is: If there is no need for soil in the garden, where would I place the plant so it does not get killed by rain or snow? Choices:  B:  Dormouse hole C:  Pot D:  Pot A:  Dormousehole C:  Flowerpot D:  Pot B:  Dormhouse E:  Flowerpot\nOutput: I would place the rose plant in the root and tuber area of the pot in a flower or weed garden.\nThere is a significant difference between a pot and a flower garden. For the first answer, the pot is the container to hold the plant, and this is typically what is referred to as a flower garden.  For the second answer, the flower garden is the area in the garden where the plant is planted, and this is typically a formal or formal or formal or formal but it is usually formal.\nOutput: Rose plant + Flower pot >>>>> Rose plant + Rose Garden\nSo the next question is: If you do not have anything to put your rose in, what is the next best substitute for the plant? Choices:  C:  Flowerpot B:  Ball of dirt D:  Ball of dirt E:  Ball of dirt F:  Ball of ground\nOutput: In the flower or weed, a flower pot is the next best substitute to a rose plant.\nOutput: Rose tree in a pot B:  Dormusehole C:  Flower pot D:  Ball of Dirt E:  Ball of Ground\nSo the next question: How many roses would you have to make up the flower arrangement if you only had two pots to put the rose?

Peter wanted a cat with two kittens, one of which he named Daisy.  Harry is the only adult cat.  What did Harry do to keep the kitten (named Daisy) safe from predators?\nOutput: Harry was unable to keep this kitten (Daisy) safe from predators because Peter gave Harry the kitten (Daisy) without agreeing to take responsibility.\nTherefore, Harry took 5*5*5 = 135$ out of Peter's pocket and deposited the money in a savings account.\nThen he decided not to show Daisy the kittens, in which his idea was thwarted.  Harry was then allowed to keep Daisy.  But Harry was able to make the kittens stay without telling Peter what was going on.  Therefore, Harry is less than 5% of the person Peter was in spite of the fact that Paul has more in every way.  So Harry's success is much less than 5%.

He bought a level that was $300.00 but the price also included a free lunch that he brought with him.\nAfter making lunch, Bob left at 9:51 but returned at 2:01 to finish his shopping and left again at 5:00 to return at 5:51 to finish his shopping.  He returned at 7:20 and it was still open.\nSo the final price was $250.00 plus $85 for lunch\nSo the total cost of lunch was $100.00 + $85 for lunch\nFor the final answer, 1+1=2 so Bob spent $85 and 2 people went to his party\nThus the total cost of birthday celebrations and parties was $100.00 = $200.00 to celebrate his birthday.\nSo Bob received a total of $200.00 as presents.\nThus the final answer is $200\n\nOutput: When the doctor visits a patient, he removes any clothing that might be dirty and asks the patient if he or she wants to be washed as well.

{"text": "He performed in the band: >><<<<<<<<<<<<<\nThe total time spent onstage in the band was 1.50 seconds, which is approximately 30 minutes.\nHow far away from home were 3 other people?\nInput: She has 12 months to save for her wedding.  If she only saves 500 dollars a month, what will she save during that 12 months?\n output: She saves 500$/month.  So she saves 25.75X12 = $625.50\nSo using her savings every month this gives her 25.75X12= $12550+325.00\nSo the total amount she has saved in 12 months is $7550+325.00 and she will have saved $12550 + $325.00 by the end of the year\nThus, the final answer is 12550 + $325.\nSince she was saved to $500 in the first month, she is saved to 250 in the second month, 50 in the third, 45 in the fourth month, and 50 in the fifth month.  So she has saved 225 total.\nIn the first month of the year she is saved to $500.  Once a month she was saved to $325.75.  Then in the next 6 months, 50 people, she was saved to 150.  In the next 12 months she is saved $500 and once a month $325.75.\nSo her total saved amounts to 225-225X6 = $625.50, and she has saved $625.50 so far.  So the total amount she will have saved by the end of the calendar year is $625.50\nHowever, there will be at least one more month in between during which she will continue to save.  Thus, instead of the total amount she has gained by the end of the December year, it will be more like $225.50 instead of the $625.50 she has gained so far.\nBecause she is saving $325.75/6, the entire year will equal $750.  Thus, a total of $900.25 will be saved by the beginning of February and by the beginning of July there will be a total savings of $225.75 so far.  Thus, total savings = $675.00\n\nInput: A farmer who recently had a death in the family suffered a major financial loss. There are two possible options for the farmer.

She keeps it very clean and looks after it very well. Jane is a member of a ladies\u2019 bike club called the Sisters of Perpetual Longevity. How many miles she has on her bike over her life time?\nOutput: Jane\u2019s bike has 0 miles on its odometer when she started working at the station in 1997. By 2014 when the bike was first parked at her place of work, it had 25,000 miles on it\nSo the total miles for her bike is 25,000 in 2 years.\nSince she doesn\u2019t use the bike very often and only rides it when she has a lot of free time and there are some days when it rains a lot, how many days can you put on the bike before it wears out and needs to be replaced?\nOutput: If, for every 30 days Jane rides her bike, we can assume that Jane has to replace her bike 1 day per month. Thus, by the time Jane\u2019s bike was 10 years old, it would lose 80,000 miles in that amount of time.\nSo, the final answer is 20\n\nInput: At a farm, Mary and Josephine have a herd of sheep.

Mary decided to let Brian go to Disneyland on Tuesdays.\nThe problem Mary ran into was that Karen wasn\u2019t interested in helping out with chores.  Mary told Karen that she thought that Karen\u2019s real reason was that she wanted to get the extra time with her son before he left to visit Disneyland.  Mary also told Karen that Karen\u2019s friend, Stephanie, was the primary chore-giver in their family and that Karen didn\u2019t consider her to be the primary chore-givers in her family.  Mary told Karen to think about it and make a reasonable compromise.\nWhen Karen went to see Mary for the next time, she said that her real reason was that she knew that her son really wanted to go to Disneyland. She said she was willing to change how she used to do chores (such as going out on walks with Karen first) in order to accommodate her son\u2019s wishes.\nWhen she and Mary spoke with Mary the next day, Mary explained the deal, and suggested that Karen should take a pay cut to help out with chores.  According to Mary, a pay cut was the way to get Karen to reconsider being the primary chore-gIVER in their family because Karen wouldn\u2019t do so well if she had to take a pay cut from her boyfriend.\nWhen Karen went back to work on Tuesday, her workload was reduced by 80% since the next day she\u2019d be helping out with chores.\nMary also reminded Karen that Brian works for the state and she said she could tell that from the amount of time Brian put in to work on his homework while he was at school that he\u2019d prefer to work part time for $500 a month than earn $250 a month working at the state\u2019s amusement park on Sundays.\nSo the final answers are 25, 55, and 10 for Karen\u2019s parents.

{"text": "A game C. Theatre, hockey game\nThere was a show scheduled with tickets at $5.00 each and a theatre movie ticket was at $3.00.  At $3.00 the theatre show was the only thing available.  The hockey ticket would only get you to the concession stand for dinner, whereas the theatre ticket would allow you to watch the movie.\nThat was only one of the many reasons why a hockey game is the loudest at a hockey game.  Another reason is the crowd is older and they are more knowledgeable of the game.  This is true of both music concerts and concerts in the theater.  One of the best places to enjoy the quiet of a theater is backstage in a concert hall.\n\nInput: There are 12,000 people in the city of Houston.  There are 100,000 cars in the city.

If the moon is at the same distance as the moon is it\u2019s daytime.\nOutput: If the moon is at 1 mile from earths position relative to earth, it is at midnight, if it is at the same distance from earths position relative of the moon its daytime.\nInput: In order for two bodies to both fly directly over a fixed distance from each other the moon and earth must be close to each other for the objects to do this. If this is the case the earth and the moon would be on opposite sides of the sky.\nOutput: If two objects with mass travel at a fixed speed, then if the mass equals the velocity, then all objects will fly in a straight line, and if the object\u2019s speed equals the mass, then all objects will travel at the same speed.\nSo in order for a fixed distance between two bodies the motion of one object must travel the same distance as the other, and if the mass of one object is equal to the mass of the other, the sum of both object\u2019s mass makes their motion the same distance.\nSo in order to create a distance between two objects, if one object requires a fixed distance to appear as though it is moving away from another object, then the distance between the objects is the same distance. So the distance between two objects is equal. So the final answer is 11\n\nInput: A family has an average income of $50,000 a year. Each child has a $10,000 allowance.

If Matthew is currently moving west, what hours of midnight do you expect Matthew to pass through the Eastern standard time zone? Output: Since 1 hour is 4 miles, assuming that 12 hrs. represents 4 miles then Matthew will move into the Eastern standard time zone at 12 hrs. midnight. Assuming that 11 hrs. represents 4 miles since 1 hour is 5 miles, then Matthew will move into Eastern standard time at 11 hrs. midnight. Since Matthew will pass 7pm Eastern standard time, we cannot expect it later than midnight Eastern standard time.\nOutput: In the Western time zone, it is 12 noon on October 25 while in the Eastern time zone it is 12 midnight.\n\nInput: Jane worked with a team in the production department to develop an idea.

For the first car, they need to pay 10,000$ from their own money.  John needs to fill a gas tank at $0.79/gal.  How many gallons will this cost?\nOutput: John needs to fill a car to $39.19 / 10,000$ x $0.79 = $39.19\nJohn will not require gas at $19.00/gal. or 3.00/gal. He can fill the car at $0.79 for $39.19 / 100,000$ x 2 = $39.19 which is the same cost as using a gas pump at the gas station.\nSo the final result will be $39.19\n\nInput: It would be cheaper to buy an entire tractor trailer than to build 1 car rental car.

How much gas was there at the gas station?\nOutput: There was no gas. An employee tried to sell the gasoline in the car, but the man did not want to buy the gasoline there. So the light in the parking garage was green so the attendant should stop selling gasoline at the station.\nWith a total of 17 gallons of gasoline, an employee put them in the truck and drove away.  What is the total amount of gasoline that was in the Honda at this time?\nOutput: The gas level in the Honda was 17.8%.\nWith 17.8 gallons in it, this left 19.4 gallons in the truck. Using the Honda tank, the total gas level in the Honda and the 19.4 gallons in other cars was 1,100 and 3,800, respectively, at this time.\nAssuming there is 1,100 pounds of gas in all the cars, there would be enough gas in only 1 Honda as the Honda tank was 5.2 gallons.  But the gas level in the other 4 cars was equal, so there is 1,600 pounds of gas in all 4 cars, and none of the cars had enough gasoline to get to the gas station.\nSo by a process of elimination, 1,600 pounds of gasoline equaled 1,400 gallons of gasoline but there were 1,800 gallons in the 4 cars to get to the gas store.  Thus, the total of 1,200 pounds of gasoline in the car and the 19.4 in the truck came to 1,440 pounds, and it was 2/3 of the total gas available.

After that I would have to do it again. At the end of the day, all of that dirt would still be dusty and dry, and would still have to be moved from one place to another, which would take weeks, if not months.\nIf I wanted to store the dirt that I dug up and put back in my garden, I would put it on top of a pile of dirt.

How much from September to January does a person save? Outcome: I get $4000+5000. It was a group effort and everyone saved $500 each month. How much in a year is needed to buy shoes by everyone?\nOutput: I get $5000+$4000\nLet\u2019s assume that someone saves $500 each month.\nSo her total is $5500. So her business has made $5500 in sales. So her business will be doing very well.\nSo this is her baseline income and she wants to save $2000 for an emergency. Her emergency will include an emergency of being $3500 in back interest debt. So her goal is to save $2000 in 30 months.\nHowever, her business in December did badly against her expectations. It is estimated that she will have only $1000 in the bank. Also she cannot save the $2000 and still go out to buy shoes. She wants to buy shoes on credit.\nTherefore, using her baseline income, she will have 1 month in a year where she will NOT make any income from a business. She was $2000 out of money.\nSince she has another $4000 she wants to save, she starts thinking of ways of getting $2000 in income without her own business. There are the following options she considers:\n1. Raise the rent for her place 3 dollars per month. This will cost her $1150.\n2. Sell all of her food stuffs. This will cost her only $1490.\n3. Sell all of everything she has. She will make another $1490\nSo her business is doing better than she expected. She has sold $3000 more than her expectations. So her business is not making all the money she needs. She has saved $3000 more than expected in the first month after it started. Therefore, she wants to spend $2890 on savings for January. She also wants to invest $300 in a checking account monthly that she can save up in. So she sets all of her bills to automatic. She also buys all her clothing as a gift.\nSo her business is making money. She is now saving $3000 because she has less", "answer": "D: step forward"}

The other boat is for the lake and has 5 points for leaky valves, which may fail prematurely when it is used on the lake.

It has a leak proof valve on the main engine which, when opened, will open all the valves and stop the boat. However, when you take the watercraft on the lake, the main engine leaks while the other engine runs. The boat is therefore less than the boat for use on the lake because the second boat has to use the main engine. Thus the final answer is the best boat for use on the water is the 2nd boat on the water.\n\nInput:A teacher has a student write a 10 page paper about a topic like \"The First 100 Days of Harry Truman's Presidency\".

It took me only 10 minutes to get her on the phone and explain my situation and help her.  The problem isn\u2019t that Bob asked me for help, it\u2019s that the reason he came to her office is to tell her what a great receptionist she is and how hard he works for her.\nOutput: Bob gives Iris an unsolicited piece of advice.\nHe said that she gave him a hard time for asking, but that was okay because he had done his job, and I did my job, and everybody does.\nHe said \u201cI hate to say this to her, because I'm sure she appreciates what you did and all \u2013 but you were the only one who could help her.\nHe suggested that she ask her bosses from time to time in case her boss doesn\u2019t talk to her.  He said that one time she was having trouble with something and asked one person if he had ever been in a situation like it -- and that person said \u2013 Yes, of course -- you have to have everyone working toward a common goal.\nThen that person suggested a different person to help her.\nHe said Bob is probably the best person to help her because he is the one who really gets it and knows what to do.\nSo Bob tells Iris that it would be a good idea to ask her boss.  So she asks Bob (as I was trying to explain the situation to her).  He says that it\u2019s fine, she will get a better answer than just asking someone from her department.  So, she asks her boss and he tells her that he doesn\u2019t know what to tell her, but she should ask Bob\u2026 and she does\u2026 and it\u2019s Bob.\nShe goes home and thanks Bob for what he just told", "answer": "B: generous"}

You have two cars in which will you park?\nOutput: In the first car will be your wife, who will bring 4 children, and one child will carry a dog.\nThe second car will be your son, who will take you back to Las Vegas, where he lives.  You will not need a car since you are taking the bus from San Diego to Las Vegas.\nIn each car there will be 2 adults, a child and 2 children. So you will have 2 adults and 8 children in each car.\nTherefore, in total, 7 adults will need 4 cars.  If you take the bus from Las Vegas to San Diego, there will be 30 people, including yourself, who will need 4 cars.\nSo the final total comes out to the following numbers: 2 adults + 8 children + 2 adults. That is 8 adults and 18 children in total.\nNow you will be able to see that the final answer is two adults * 8 children. That is 2 adults * 8 children * 2 adults + 2 children = 8 adults + 18 children = >>8 adults + 12 children.\nSo the final overall number is >>8 adults + 12children + 2 adults + 2 children.

You decide that there will be 2 pairs of tennis shoes which will give you 20 pairs of shoes in total.\nAgain, the number of pairs of sneakers you need depends upon the amount of sneakers that you need. As a first step you determine that you need 20 pairs of sneakers.\nSince you have 20 pairs of sneakers you will only need 2 pairs of tennis shoes. However, there will also be 2 pairs of sneakers and 1 pair of tennis shoes. So 20+2*2 = 30.\nSo the final number is 30.\n\nInput: You arrive at the", "answer": "C: body armor"}

Mary is looking to purchase a mobile home to rent. After comparing different mobile homes in the area, she decided to buy one.   Is this a good idea?\nOutput: Mary chose mobile home A to buy as well as mobile home B. Mary bought A and B was not in the budget.\nSo Mary chose a $17, 000 mobile home and paid $10,000 for it. Mary will be using $17,000 as payment for rent. Mary must save $10,000, so Mary will have $10,000 left over. The savings have to be used first because Mary\u2019s brother and sister-in law have been living with her for the month. So Mary will be using her savings first.\nBut what if after the month is up Margaret and Jack move out? Will Mary have to pay off the balance of $10,000 first?\nSo Mary should consider buying mobile home B since it is slightly more expensive than the other mobile homes that were sold to other families. Mary will then pay off her balance with monthly payments of $250. So Mary will save an extra $250 per month instead of using her savings to start her mobile home. And that is money that could used to buy a better mobile home or to pay down her credit card balance.  She also should consider getting a new mobile home since the cost is now $17,000, which is more than she expected. If she doesn\u2019t buy a better mobile home, or if she keeps buying new homes because she has a cheaper price to ask for, she eventually would have paid more than the advertised price of the mobile home. Also, with her savings, she might be able to get a better price for her home than she initially wanted without the additional funding.\n\nInput: Mary has several people in her family who live in a mobile home.

A travel trailer without a 3-wheel drive will go for $16,000.  When the travel trailer is empty, it weighs approximately 18,000 lbs.  The motor home is priced at $22,000, which includes a 5-wheel drive.  If one person has no vehicle to transport the gear it is $3,000.  Using this math, the motor home can now be considered a travel trailer and thus is not a motorized vehicle. Also, since the motorized vehicle cannot bear the trailer, it only weighs 6,000 lbs, so the motorhome is only a motorized trailer.

Once every year, she gives one of her horses to a rescue agency for free.  When she was ready to give back her horse, she put the farm up on the market to raise money to buy a new horse.  Since she knows how much people are willing to pay for horses, she wants to ask her friends to donate 5-10 times as much as they would give. How much money could she raise?\nOutput: The woman has friends offering $30.00 per horse.  Because 10 people total know that she is asking them to donate $30.00 for her horse, she will likely raise $25.00 from friends which will leave $15.00 for her.\nSo the final $15.00 is the amount she needs to raise to buy a horse.\nSo the final question is: How much money did the woman raise?\nBecause of the large number of people interested, the total amount raised will be $55.00\nSo the total raise will be $55\n\nInput:The woman loves her horse but has another that she wants to give to a different rescue agency for free because the horse is too old to be used without medical attention.  Therefore, the woman will not be able to give the horse away.  Therefore, she has put up her farm on the market for free to raise money to buy another horse.  How much money could she make?\nOutput: The owner of the horse is willing to pay $50.00 + the cost of the horse = $55.00.\nTherefore, the total income generated by her farm will be $55.\nSo the final income generated by the farm will be $55\nThus, the final number is $55\n\nInput and Output:\n3 men were given a chance to help plan a group tour of the European continent.

How much hay should I give them each day?\nOutput: Each day you feed them twice, you should feed them 1/2 of the hay they need.\nSuppose you give them 10/2 =.2 pounds of hay.\nThus, if you feed them.2 lbs. of hay every day, you would feed them 4/2 =.4 pounds of hay.\nFeeding them twice a day = 2/4 = >>2/4=.8 pounds of hay.\nSo your cows will get 4/8= >>8/8= 12.2 pounds of hay each day.\nNow, you have to feed them 1/8 of 11/2 = 1/8 of the amount of hay they will get.\nThus, every other day you should give them 1/8 = 1/8 = 0.2 pounds of hay.  Thus, your cows will get 1/8 of the 4/8 = 1/1 = <1/1>= 1.2 pounds of hay that you feed them every other day.\nThus, your cows will get half the amount of hay you feed them every other time they come to the pasture.\nThus, the resulting net number of days the cows will eat is\n200+200&0.2=500+200=<<250+200+0.2=650>>650 = 50\nCows eat 1/200 of the amount of hay you give them every other day.

He then went on the website and found that there were tickets available for a flight to New York City for $20.  If he buys this ticket, how much would he save?\nOutput: He bought all the tickets because he did not want to miss out on his trip to New York City.\nSo given the travel costs of $60, the total savings will be $20\nThus, on this trip, he saves $20/trip.\nSo the final price is $20\n\nInput: Sarah has 4 children. They live on a farm.  She sends each one a list of things that he wants to do each school day at school.  All of the things on the list should be done but she has a few that are not done.  She asks her husband Gary, who has a 3 year old son, how many chores are done.  Gary told her that only 24 chores were done on each day and therefore in this case, all 4 kids are finished with their chores for the day.  Sarah asks for a refund of the $80 charge by the farm.  Gary denies the refund but she does not want to be scolded with a $80 bill.  She asks to speak to the supervisor or manager of the property.  She asks for a discount for the 4 extra chores that were not done.  Since she did not check and see that her chores and the 4 extra chores are done, how much are the 4 extra chores?\nOutput: It\u2019s 3 chores.\nIf she does not check and see the chores are done on each day, Sarah will not pay for the extra chores as she will not feel he is being trustworthy.  Thus, on this trip, she will not pay for the 4 extra chores.\nSo her cost for the extra chores will not cost her $80. She pays $4 for each extra chore.\nSo the final total is 4 extra chores = $4/time plus $80 for not checking daily.\nSo the 3 extra chores paid are $4 = <<3+4> = <<$4 + 8>>", "answer": "A: desire"}

Jennie rented a rental for 11 days. How many, in dollars, did Jennie pay for the rental? Output: 5 days later she paid $185 for the car. There were 22-22=<<22-22=3>>3 days left. There were 10-10=<<10-10=1>>1 days left. There were 13-13=<<13-13=5>>5 days left. The remaining 5 days were 20-20=<<20-20=10>>10 days. There were 12-12=<<12-12=5>>5 days still left. There were 15-15= <<15-15=20>>5 days left. There were 19-18=<<19-18=5>>9 days left. There were 18-18=<<19+18=9>>9 days left. The final 4 days were 15-15=<<19+18+9>>9 days left of the period.

Output: Twenty sandwich to sell each hour. After selling the sandwiches they make 4-4=<<4-4=7>>4 sandwiches. Since the sandwiches cost $135 they sell 8-8=<<8-8=6>>6 sandwiches per hour. Thus the number of sandwiches sold is 16-16=<<16-16=20>>20 sandwiches. The sandwiches were made for 13+13=<<12+12=21>>21 hours. Thus the number of hours served by 15 is 11 hours.

She had an agreement that if she did not pay it back, she would need to give one of her uncles money that she had saved.  But she wanted the money to be returned at the end of the month because it was for the birthday of her father, not just for her own birthday.  Her uncle said that he would loan her the money if she agreed not to use it for another birthday party.  But she didn\u2019t have enough money to pay it back so she said would keep her promise. How did she pay him back?\nOutput: The amount of money Melissa borrowed was $120 and the amount that Uncle John gave her back was $60.\nSince Melissa was able to pay Uncle John the $120 she owed, her uncle repaid $60 after he had an opportunity to borrow more money. The balance left was $60 and she lent that amount to one of her relatives.\nShe needed to come up with $60 extra to pay Uncle John back.  She found that she needed $60/18.00 = $100.00 to repay Uncle John when she got home.  So she borrowed another $100 from Aunt Martha.  She owed Aunt Martha $100.00, Aunt Martha gave her $80, and Aunt Martha gave her another $20.  Then Aunt Martha gave her another 20 and she repaid Uncle John the $120.\nSo how much money did her cousin have available to lend and how much money did Aunt Martha have?\noutput: Aunt Martha: $80.00\nAunt Martha: $20.00\nAunt Sally: $50.00\nUncle John: $120.00\nSo the $120 total that she needed to repay Uncle John was $120.00 + $80.00+ $20.00 = $150.00\nSo the total amount that Uncle John repaid Martha was $150.00\nThus, the final answer is 150", "answer": "B: lie down"}

They have a single car. How much will it cost them?\nOutput: Since they are each going to spend one third of the cost together for the car, then the car will cost $100.00 together.\nSo the final cost divided by 3 is $103.50.\nThe driver of the single car was responsible for $100.00 and since the total cost was $103.50 then he was responsible for $101.50, so on.  Since this costs $103.50 as a rule of thumb, it would be $100$ x 0.05 = $2.00.  Since this is divided by 3, then the driver got paid $9.50.\nThe total cost divided by 3 is 0.05 = $9.00.\nSince this is a rule of thumb, the car will cost $0.05 per person, and the driver will get $9.50 for the trouble.  Since the party is $9.50 per person, that\u2019s only $0.25 per person = $2.00.\nTherefore the overall cost divided by 3 was $2.00\n\nInput: In a large store, there are three people, each paying $0.50. Every other customer pays $1.00. The total cost for this store of one transaction is $4.00.\nOutput: Because of the way they calculate the charges, the total in store cost is $4.00 minus $2.50.

After a while, you\u2019ll have a list with about 120 common words.\nThe letters A and B are used for words that are used less frequently than the letters D and E, in the order: bread > clothes > food > chairs > books.  However, bread, milk, and water are used frequently, as a result, they are the first two letters that make sense.  Bread and clothes are used rarely, because everyone who eats bread and watches TV wants a shirt and a hamburger.  Milk and water are rare, but are used to represent the things that we use lots of: water and sugar, and bread and TV.\nSo, B and E are the third two letters that make sense in a list of 60 common words.  Bread and clothes make sense, as the first two do, because bread and clothes are so common.  Milk and water make sense because milk is used to represent meals and dinner.  Bread and clothes makes sense because, you know, bread and clothes.  If you use the letters A and B as the first two letters in a word, you use a word that has a more frequent common letter.  In the current list, bread is the third letter used, or it gets switched out with milk and water.  Since bread and clothes are so frequent, they form the second two letters.  Thus, you use A to make bread and clothes and E to make milk and water, as discussed.  Then, you mix these up to make milk and water.  You may use B as the first two, but", "answer": "D: cupboard"}

At each lecture, A compares a list of numbers to a list of constants, and finds the lowest or most stable set of numbers that contains the rest of the numbers in the list. The list of numbers must contain all the values in the class, or the lowest set of numbers in the set must contain all the values that are not in the class, otherwise the numbers in the list are unstable. A uses this formula when he compares two numbers to discover the average maximum value of any single number. A compares the list of numbers and finds the lowest or highest stable set of numbers that have the lowest or highest values. A has found the optimal set of numbers if the list contains all of the numbers without this number of numbers.

Output: > A B C\nEach round, each player plays one card from the deck of cards.  If no card is played first, the first card drawn is the discard card and the second card drawn is the draw card.  If no card draws first, the second card drawn is a discard and the first card drawn is a draw.  If the second card drawn is not discarded it is the draw card.\nIf the second card drawn is discarded, the first card drawn becomes the discard card.  If, after the 1st card has been played, there is no card in the discard pile, the next played card is drawn and continues to be played until there is an empty discard pile at the end of the round.\nIn a round of five cards each one player may play their discard card and may draw another card by choosing the card that is drawn.  So, if there are no discarded cards in the discard pile, any player may play their discard, draw another card, and play another round.\nFor five cards each player may play one card from the second deck of cards\n\nInput:The number of people in an orphanage varies from 100 to 200, the children who live there range from 4 years old to 14 years old, and the staff is almost always more than one person.

Out of the 15 classes, only one was of importance.  He failed the other classes and received a lower grade than he normally would.  He would be punished with an F. Now suppose the student works on the rest of the grades.  The student is told that the grades will be F, but that he is not being penalized for not taking his important class.  How many hours does the student spend working on his school grades?\nOutput: The amount of time spent on school grades depends on a student\u2019s interest.  If a student is very busy and will work on grades for most of the time he is in school, then his time spent studying is probably not very much.  However, if the student\u2019s interest is limited to studying part of the time and not finishing the work, then the student may have to put in more time on the school grades than needed to complete the work.\nAssume that the student studied all of his grade.  He would be expected to earn a grade of 8.  Therefore, the amount of time needed to work on school grades is 8 divided by the number of school grades he earned.  Therefore, the required amount of time to do the class work for school grades, including time to read his homework,", "answer": "C: music store"}

{"text": "vent\nThe choice of venting energy comes down to 1) breathing out and 2) expelling the energy through a work-off.  For oxygen to be released, you must breathe.  That\u2019s why breathing out is considered the first choice.  Expelling energy through a work-out is considered a work-off, but is only if the amount of work you do is more than what you can exert at once; you can\u2019t exert all the energy you need to exhaust while getting up and running out the door.\nSo on a regular day, you can expunging ~20% of your body weight by running through the streets.

If the cattle have to drive at 30 mph, how long will it take to move from the point Jason starts moving the cows in the trailer to a new point where he will then move the cattle?\nOutput: Assuming that Jason starts with 40 cows and finishes with 90 cows and 2 trailers driving at 30 mph, he will need to move the cows 2 miles at 30 mph.\nThus, Jason will need to move 90 cows at 30 mph (40/(2*3), which is 60 miles per hour.)\nSo Jason will travel a total of 60 miles from his starting point to his last point.\nThus, Jason has the total distance traveled by the cows, 90^2 = 3.6 miles.\nSo each cow has an average travel time of 12.8 miles = <<120^2=36>>36 miles per hour.\nThus, for each cow, he will need to travel 6.4 miles.\nSo the total distance for 90 cows would be 36/6 = 30 miles which is 240 total miles of travel time.\nSo Jason will need about 40 miles of travel time for 90 cows.\nThus, he will need a total of 80 miles of travel time = 40/48=4 miles\nSo there is a total of 2 miles of travel time. For each cow he will have to travel 4 miles.\nTherefore, travel time for the cows is 2^60 = 120 minutes or 1.8 hours.\nThus, Jason needs an hour and 30 minutes to move 450 cows.\nTotal travel time for 450 cows is 180 minutes so each cow has a total travel time of 360 minutes or 1.4.\nThus, Jason spent 10 hours driving and the cows traveled 2.3 miles.\nSo the final travel time for 450 cows would be 480 minutes = 4 hrs 15 mins.\nSo Jason spent 1 hr 15 min at his final destination!\nNow where does that", "answer": "C: dangerous"}

He will then return the boys to their rooms to be alone with the family room after he checks them all in at 3am.\nOutput: One father had 4 sons and 3 girls, and another had 2 sons and no daughters.  How many times did each father check the boys into his rooms, and what was his average number of hours spent each night watching each boy?\nThe amount of time each father spent each night watching his sons ranged from 3 hours to 8 hours.  Each day, the father had to check in with the boys before the start of school (Monday to Friday) to verify that he had attended to them so that the time spent each night watching their boys was not excessive.\nTotal number of hours spent by the fathers each night watching each of their sons was 18 hours, which included the time spent by the father\u2019s wife in the child-care section of his employer\u2019s home.\nThe total amount of time each of the fathers spent each night watching each of the boys was 54 hours, which included the amount of time spent by the father alone in the house.\nThus, this father had 54 hours to spend with the boys, or 54 hours per night = 2*2*2h = 54 hours per night.\nSo the final average family-time spent each night was 54 h\nSo the final answer was 54\n\nInput:  Alice lives alone in a house.

The janitorial tasks must be completed by the time the custodian, Mr. Smith, leaves for the day.\nOutput: It can take 3 hours to finish, plus the time the janitor spends getting ready and cleaning up. Because Mr. Smith leaves for the day so early each day, it takes about 3.5 hours to complete all janitorial duties for the day.\nThus, Mr. Smith leaves on the 4th for work and the janitor, Mr. Smith, cleans up afterward. Thus, three hours for the entire day = <<3.5*3*3=7.5>>7 hours of cleaning tasks\nSo, each hour of janitorial tasks = <<7*7*7 = 17.5>>17.5 hours of janitorial tasks\nSo, 3.5 * 17.5=<<17.5*17.5=37.5>>37.5 hours of janitors were responsible for cleaning up after Mr. Smith\nSo Mr. Smith leaves for work on Tuesday and the janitor, in addition to cleaning up after him, also cleans up. Thus, three hours of janitorial duties would have been necessary to clean up after three separate employees, Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith\u2019s assistant, and another janitor. Thus, three hours had to be taken for cleaning up each day.

The house can now rent out the rest of the winter and the remainder of the spring.\nSince it would be very difficult to rent it out to another family for the rest of the winter, it will not be necessary to rent the house this winter.\nAnd since it would be very difficult, the carpenter will not rent it out to a friend for the rest of the spring.\nThus, the repairs will not finish the winter and will not be finished by spring.\nSo he will not rent it out during the winter.\nSo the final result is NO\n\nInput: It is not safe to leave your vehicle in the garage for more than 45 minutes.

He takes out 50 cents and walks back to the bus stop.  What are the odds that he will run into a homeless person?\nOutput: 0.0000000000001/3:5\nSo if you are standing at the bus stop and waiting for the bus you can only be 10 feet away from a homeless person.  So if you were standing 3 feet away from the man at the bus stop and he was 5 feet away from someone else, you would have a 0.00001% probability of both of you running into a homeless person.\nSo if you were at the bus stop 1.3 seconds before he was at the bus stop, you would have a 1.3% probability of running into a homeless person on a bus.\nSo, if you were at the 2.3 seconds before he is at the bus stop, then you would have a 1% probability of running into that homeless person when he has a 0.9% probability of running into someone else.\nSo if it is 2.3 seconds after he is at the bus, you will have a 0.59% probability of running into another homeless person.\nSo you walk to your car with 50 cents in your pocket and 5 cents in your back and you get home with 50 cents in your hand.

The average passenger in the boat is 6 feet two inches tall.  There are 6,000 cars in New York City, and 3,700 trucks in Los Angeles. Which car can drive the longest distance over a given weekend?\nOutput: The car with the 6 foot 2 inch passenger will drive 600 miles in 24 hours.\nIf the car with the 6 foot two inch passenger drove 12 hours, the car with the 6 feet two inch passenger will drive 790 miles in 24 hours. And the car with the 6 ft two inch passenger would drive 590 miles in 24 hours instead. Thus, the person with the 6 ft two inches passenger will drive the longest distance in 24 minutes and 18 seconds during this time. For this car, 15 minutes per mile equals 15 minutes of driving. That means that the person with the 6 foot two inches passenger will actually drive 690 miles in 24 minutes and 18 second, or one hour and 25 minutes.\nThe other car, the one with the 6 ft two passenger who drove 14 hours in 24 hours, would drive 590 miles, or 6 hours and 55 minutes without stopping. This car only needs to drive 3 hours and 55 minutes over the weekend. However, since there will be people on board, the car can only drive three hours and 55 minutes if 8 people are in the car, since people traveling on the car must stop several times each hour to unload luggage, etc. Thus, the person on the car with the 6\u2019 two inch passenger will drive the longest time of the 3 cars because of the load.\n\nInput: There is a construction project going on in a warehouse close to the train yard.

The building is on 10 acres and it is made up of 9 barns.  At the end of the 9th and final barn is a hay barn.  Since barns do not have electrical or plumbing, how does he get the electricity/pipes to the barns?\nOutput: There are only 7 buildings and therefore 7 buildings are used to get all electricity, plumbing and electricity pipes on the property.\nThere is an electrical pole standing approximately 25 feet high.  The pole has 4 wires.  The wires start out on the top left and snake through all of the barns.  The wires will tie into each other, which makes it easier to get to pipes on the property.  There will be 5 water pipes going across the property that lead to the hay barns, 3 plumbing pipes, 2 fire pipes and 1 electrical pipe.  Each of these pipes will tie into the other, which further makes it easier to get the pipe from one to the next.\nThere are 9 buildings and therefore 17 buildings are used on the property.\nSo the final product will be: 17 buildings = 35 acres + 3 buildings = 49 acres = <<35 acres+3=69>>69 acres\nOn the property, there will be 7 buildings: barn, hay barn, office, utility building, barn across the road at the end A) the hay barn, B), the utilities building, C) the office building, D) the barn across the road B) the garage, E), building A) the hay barn and F) the utility building.\nTotal area - 49 acres = <<49-7=", "answer": "A: birthday party"}

These two ways will be used to arrive at this problem.  One method involves the counting of time units, while the other way uses the counting of length units.\nOne way to count the number of days in a year would be to count 24/365 days x 2 or, in other words, 24 days in a year.  Another way to measure the number of days in the year is to count the time units, in terms of hours and minutes.  Finally, another method involves the measuring of how long a day is by dividing it by the number of hours in the day.  This method is called time-length-hours or times-length-hours.\nThe problem is a bit more complicated than the two methods, but essentially this is a counting problem.

In 10 years the Cubs will be in the playoffs, the Brewers will never be in the playoffs. There are only four innings left in the baseball game. How much time will it take for the Brewers to score 100 runs?\nOutput: Assuming the score is 5-5, the Brewers need 21 runs to score 100 runs. The Brewers would only need 491 hits, so it would be 481*21 = 576 runs.\nSo the final result is 576/490=<<576/490=1>>1 innings.\nSo in order to get 491 hits the Brewers would need 576 innings.\nThere is another way to look at this. Say there will be a tie. Then the Brewers will play the last game.\nThen they will need 2 more games to score 100 hits. The Brewers would need 45 innings to score 45 runs.\nSo 508*2=67 runs.\nSo in order for the Brewers to score 6 runs it will take 508 years since the last time that the baseball game was played.\nSo in 6.8 billion seconds the Brewers would need to score 6 runs.\nSo the total score will be 575 + 57 = 1.85 billion.\nSo the final score is 1.85 billion/575=<<575/575=10>>10 minutes\n\nInput:A) is the right answer and B) is the wrong answer, as you may have noticed.\nOutput:\n\nInput: John is having a", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}

The price of apples from the supermarket is $.33/lb and the price of carrots from the supermarket is $1.33/lb.  If you have a family that produces 20 pounds of apples, you will have $1200.62 in groceries each month.  If you will purchase 20 pounds of carrots, you will have $18.12 in grocery expenses.  So you have a total of $1375 that you will spend each month.  The price of a new fridge is $2000 and the total cost of a microwave is $500.00.  So you have $1000 to spend each month.   The total price of groceries that you will purchase is $3500.00 and you spend $1200.62.  So you spend $3400 per month.  The total price of vegetables is $3100.  You would be consuming 35 pieces of broccoli each month with the price of carrots (2) being $120.62 each month.  So, using 35 vegetables ($1200/month) and 100 carrots per month, you will be eating $600.00 worth of vegetables ($1200/month).  You would also be consuming $1.00 per person per month in groceries.  So your total grocery bill will be $600.00+700.00**\nOutput: You will spend $600.00+200.00**100.00 + $600.00\nAs per your arithmetic function, you added 20 to $600.00 and you added 2 to $1200.62 (i.e. $1200.62 + $600.00 = $600.00) and the result is\nSo you would spend $1200.62 per month, or $1200.62/35 = $2,800.00.

{"text": "cats must drink water, eat food and annoy =<<<<<<<<<<<<\nTherefore cats must drink a minimum of 3 gallons of water every day.  Since cats don\u2019t know that they must use this amount of water, it will seem like a small amount of water, but in reality, cats must drink at least 20 gallons of water in order to be healthy enough to live.\nHowever, the quantity of water needed by cats is not an exact science so they can have a daily preference on what size water bowl they choose and even what size of bowls they use.  Because each cat has a different preference for the size of their bowl, it can vary from day to day.  It can also vary in how often it is filled.\n\n If a cat doesn\u2019t need to use more water, it will be found in different parts of rooms.\n  Cats can be found on either the side of the bed they are usually lying on or the floor next to the bed.\n  Cats will be found on the window sill, next to the front door, or directly behind the front door.\n  Cats will only use the bathroom which is at the side of the sink.\nSo, the cat can be located in any place in the house as long as it is right behind the sink.\n\nInput: If a cat is outside, it must drink water every day because the cat has to go out into the world to provide for itself. The cat must drink water because it needs to be able to walk around in order to find food. Water allows the cat to live a happy life. (How many gallons of water the cat will drink per day? What percentage of the cats water does it consume?)\nOutput: The cat must drink water everyday because it doesn\u2019t need other food. The cat will eat more water due to the amount of water it needs to survive. Since water is important to the way the cat lives, it will take up more room than other food will.\nOne cat eats 12 gallons of water every day (12 gallons = 36 pints) and needs around 36 pints per day for its health to be healthy.\nSo one cat will eat about 36 gallons of water per day.\n\nInput: John had a job interview on Monday, and he was really looking forward to it.

I will give the student about 5 or 6 minutes to choose a song and then I will take a few steps back to allow the player a bit of wind down before the song is to be finished.\nIf there are different sized students, then I will take a step back after each request for any size that I determine doesn\u2019t work.\n\nInput:It was time for Karen to rent a car. She wanted to come in town for a wedding. What rate is the agency charging?\nOutput: Karen wanted to rent a car for $60.00/day for the period of 9 days starting on October 29.  The first 3 days she selected an SUV and the total cost for 3 days was $200.00.  She selected an SUV for the 3 final three days because it is lighter and allows her to go on more errands.  The final total for 9 days is $390.00.\nThe total for 9 days is 20*60= <<20*60=340>>350.\nThe total for 3 total days will be $340/3=<<340/3=55>>55.\nTo get to the $55 cost, you need to factor in 15 hours of driving, an average of 7 hours per day for 9 days = 55*15=<<55*15=120>>120 hours of driving over 9 days = $120\nSo the final answer will be 120\n\nInput:When a couple leaves for", "answer": "D: play piano"}

They plan to spend $1000 at the wedding.  How much money do they typically spend at the wedding?\nOutput: They typically spend $1000 at the budgeted wedding. The wedding is their last discretionary expense budgeted for the year.\nAssuming that they spend $1000, they will still have $200 left for other discretionary items.\nTherefore, assuming that the family will only be living in one of the 2 bedrooms for the year, and if they are going to have a baby during that year, with the wedding being an expense already planned, if they save an additional $100 or more (the total of the budgeted wedding and birth year expenses minus leftover money added during year 6) for discretionary items, they will have $1000 left.\nTo the end goal, the family will have $1000 to spend each year.\nThus if there is money left over, the family will spend the extra $200 plus the $1000 to celebrate.\nSo the final decision is to spend $1000 + $200 = <<$1200 >>$1200.\nEach family member gets $25, and all family members are equal.\nSo the final question is $1200\n\nInput: The amount of time it takes to kill an animal is 2 hours, or 4.5 hours if the animal is eaten by a predator.

Each year the number of people in the population is 8.3 million. Assuming that each year of the WW2 population would add just 1 new person (this would give a total number of 7.93 million) the total number of years between the world wars would be 720.5 years. The number of years between WW1 and WW2 is 1212.5 years (the total number of years since the fall of Nazi Germany). Assuming the WW2 population is only half the WW1 population (which is still a little generous) then we would have only 838 more years between WW1 and WWII, but the total number of years since WW1 and between WW2 is less than 50 more years (it would take 106467 years). The total number of years between WW3 (World War III) and World War IV is 604.75 years (the total number years since the end of World War IV).\nInput: The number of years after the Civil War (Civil war) is 360, followed by the years after World War II (WWII) is 336, and then before the WWII population gets back to the level it was before the Civil War (Civil warfare). The total number of people after the Civil war to the population before WW2 is 632, then the number after WW2 is 337, then the number after the Civil war to WW2 after that is 336, which is the population of WW1 after WW1. When you add the birth rate after WW2 to the birth rate after the Civil War, the total number of people after WW2 is 456. The world population is 8.3. You added the World population to the birth rate after WW1, you get 828 people. You add the World population to the war population after WW1, you have 1.6 billion people. You add the world population to WWII, you get 2 billion people. Then, from the World population to the after war population, you get 2.1 billion people.\nOutput: The total number of years before WW2 is 5.8 years, the number after WW2 will be 2.1 years.\n\nInput", "answer": "B: slow down"}

Mary wants to move into their other brother and sister-in-law\u2019s house.  How much is Mary willing to spend to move to the other house?\nOutput: Mary is $500 a month.  She can have 1/3rd of the house.  The other 2/3rd will cost her $1,200 per month.  Then her brother-in-law gets $1,000 per month.  His salary will work out to $900 per month.  Which would work out to $1,500/month for Mary.  Thus, $1,500*3 = $3,600.\nThus, $3,600*3 = $3.67\nThus, Mary needs a down payment of $2,500.  She can spend that down payment on her house or on her brother\u2019s new house.\nSince Mary requires a new roof, she must pay down the second home debt she may need to make a down payment of $5,500.\nThus, $2,500/3= <<2+3*5=12>>12 = $125\nMary has two options for this down payment of $2.5 million dollars.\nShe can spend $1,500 on her brother\u2019sbills.  (The total home payment for his house) * 12 = $105\nShe can spend $500 total on his bills on the house.\nSo, both of the options above would leave $1,125 for Mary\u2019s down payment on her house.\nThus $1,125/3 is $2,500\nSo, Mary is given $1,125*3 = $2,500 to get her house.\nThus, $1,125/4 is $3,500.\nThus she is now on a down payment of $10,495.\nThus, Mary is now on a downpayment of $60,195.\nThus, based on the value of the house, $5.5 million would be the fair market value of the house.\nThus, Mary has realized the total house cost of $60,195\nThus, Mary is paying $", "answer": "D: every town"}

Which option should the doctor recommend?\nOutput: If the mother could afford to pay out of pocket, she should stay at home and let the children receive medical treatment, which includes insulin.\nSo there are 3 options, stay at home, drive to the hospital, or keep the children at home and receive medical treatment so that one-third or half of the cost will be covered by insurance.  For a comparison, the answer is E. With insulin the price is $3.90/dose.\nSo the final choice is E\n\nInput: If a house is being remodeled, it should be at least $200k in price. The budget for the project is $55,000. The family will spend $20,000 for the roof ($5000 total). The project should take about a month to complete. The family will split the mortgage equally between them using the same mortgage interest rates.  What additional costs would the family incur during the remodeling process?\nOutput: The house is in its prime. It is well-priced and is selling quickly. The work will only be required $7,000.\nThe costs of roof replacement: $6000\nOther: $12,000\nTotal: $15,000 (+2 months)\nSo the final answer\nFor a year:\n\nInput: Bob and his wife, Joyce, wanted to purchase the next house on their mortgage. The couple had always been renting an apartment since they started dating. They planned to make this additional investment long term. They decided to rent out the apartment for the month of February. Bob received a check for $5,750.  Joyce got an additional $3,250 for the sale of the apartment for a total of $7,000.  So if they bought the house, they would each have a $10,250 surplus for the month of February as the rental income from the apartment was $7,000.", "answer": "E: town"}

She has been to England but has not had any real experience in the USA having only dated many of the Americans.  She has received a job offer from the US based airline Jet Blue and decides to go to work for them.  Over the next 2 years, Jet Blue will pay her $60,000.  In the same period of time she will also be entitled to a salary of $24,000 for two months per year as an office manager.  In total, there is $108,000 that Jet Blue is paying her during the 2 years.  She starts work on January 1, 2013.  For this entire period, Jet Blue will expect her to work every day, and on certain days she will work only 1 day.  She will work 8 hours/day on average for the first 3 months and then after the 3 months are up she will work 4 hours/day for the remaining 3 months.  Does that equate to more than 10 hours per work week?  Or does 10 hours/week sound like a fair starting point for someone making $60,000?  Is she being paid too much?\nOutput: The 10 hours/day sounds about right.  She will be receiving $60,000 for 2.25 x 1.25 = $90,000\nTotal income from Jet Blue, in the first 3 months, is $72,000 for a total of $72,000.\nThen the earnings will be adjusted for inflation. During this time she will be paid out $60,000 less in salaries.\nNow for the salary adjustment:\n$69,000 + $84,000 + $36,000 = $84,000\n$54,000 x $72,000 = $63,000\nWith inflation, $63,000 should now equal $85,000.  So after the first 3 months, the income will start to be adjusted because of inflation for the last 4 years.\nShe will receive a raise in pay from $60,000 to $84,000 in the last year of the job after the adjustment.\nSo she is currently getting paid $78,000+84,000+36,000 = $", "answer": "D: legal fees"}

E: every city\nThe school population is divided 50/50 between the 3 types of zones; residential neighborhood, community center, and building so the ratio between schools must be 1:3. The 2 areas together are still evenly divided.\nOutput: The ratio between residential neighborhood and community center places is 3:2. The ratio between community center and building places is 4:2. The ratio of residential neighborhood of children to adults is not as high as the ratio for each the of the 3 separate school areas.\nTherefore, the community center and building place give the highest priority to the school. Each of the 3 residential neighborhoods, however, gives equal priority to the school. In this case, each of the 3 residential neighborhoods of children to adults yields a rating of 2. Community center and building place give an rating of 1.\nThe residential neighborhood, however, is much the same as the school. Both give an average rating of 2. The residential neighborhood has the highest average rating because all of the children at the school are from the community center and building and therefore all of the children will be attending the school so the school will have a similar ratio to the residential neighborhood. In this case, however, every child in the community center and building area is of the parent of each of the 12 children attending the school, or more likely the parent of all of the children from the kindergarten through grade 5 part. This gives every child in the kindergarten through grade 5 area a ratio of 3:2 (that is, every 4th child will attend). This gives every child in grades 6 through 8 an average of 2. Therefore, the average rating of the school is 2 for every child attending this one kindergarten through grade 5 area.\nWith the average rating of the 1st through 12th grade area, the ratio is 1:3. The remaining 6.01% of the school\u2019s population are rated less than 1 by all the schools within 5 miles and the average rating for the remaining population is 3.01%.

If it takes you 1 year to get housewife income and 1 year to get your husband income, how much time do you think you'll be saving by taking both incomes?\nOutput: 1 year = <<1**1+22=30>>30\nSo, by taking two incomes for a year, each household will save 60 days of extra income. So each household\u2019s total income is $6020*1=<<60**2 = $16200.\nSo if each household saves $16200=<<16200=48>>48 days of extra income each year, they will save a total of $21600*48 = $27600 in total.\nSo, in this year, the total income saved is $21600 and in the next year it is $21600 + $21600 = $21600. Thus, in the end, the total savings of the households after one year from taking in the extra income is $21600.\nThus, taking just the extra income for a year saves them $21600\nThus, taking the full family\u2019s incomes for one year saves them $216000.\nSo, after one year, the total savings is $21600 and the savings in the following year are $21600 + $3600 = $27800\nThus, the total savings of taking just the extra income in one year is $21600\nThus the family spends $3600 in one year.\nSo, taking just the extra money for 4 years saves the family $540000\nThus, taking a maximum of $36000 per year saves the family $5400\nThus the total savings of", "answer": "A: swimming pool"}

For each of these people, the sum of their ages is 25-26, and the sum of their ages for their respective children is 33-34.  Their children also age separately.  Assume that A gives the children each $200 every month, and B gives the children each $100 every month.  The monthly payments for each adult son and daughter would equal $400 and $750 respectively.  So, what is the total amount a couple can spend on their children every month and still be able to save enough money to retire (or at least afford some sort of living situation)?  Is it possible to save money and pay for a college diploma each month with this extra money?  The answer to this question will be related to the answer to the other question, since a college diploma is required to secure a job.\nOutput: B will save $20, since he is 33 and his college cost is $2000 and A will save $30, since she is 25 and her college cost is $2000 (this only applies to B if C does not attend college).\nC will save $75.\nIn this case, B and C will have $3100.\nSo they will have $3200 to invest, with the extra $300 going to the college fund.\nSo the final balance is $3200\n\nInput: A goes into hospital and sees a doctor.

The program would have 100 lines of code.  Each line of code would be of the form:\n1) The value of $1 is the decimal point,\n2) The value is 1.000000.\nSince there are 16 bytes in a line, 16 - 12 = 16 bytes per line, then when computing what the value of $1 is, Joe must divide $1 by itself four times.  How many times can $1 be divided by itself?\nOutput: If you divide $1 by itself 4 times, then $1 has a value of $16.\nIf you divide $1 by 8 times, then $1 is 6 +.20 = 24\nIf you divide by 16 times, then $1 represents a value of 3,000,000,000, where 3,000,000 is 10 trillion.\nIn all the iterations of this program, Joe must divide $16 by itself 4 times and therefore has a value of $32,664, which is 16 times the value of $1, multiplied by 32, which equals $32,66,144\nSo the final answer was 8\n\nOutput: On Saturday, Peter met Jack at Joe\u2018s house for a party.

Given that the total cost to build a three-piece table would be $1200, how many people do you think will need their tables to be more than one story?\nOutput: One story.\nThe average cost of a three-piece table is $1200.\nIf the tables need to be higher than three stories, then the total cost of those tables would need to be $1800. If that is the case, why is this?\nTherefore, it appears that no one will need more than 1 story, and for one set of tables, the cost would need to be $1200 for one set.\nSo the final output (for two sets of tables) is $1200 ($1200/3**2) = $1200.\nThus it appears that nobody needs more than 1.5 sets of tables, and for one set, the cost would need be $1200 for one piece.\nSo the final total output (for one-piece tables) is $1200 = $1200+*2 = $1200.\nSo the final price for a single", "answer": "E: small case"}

Thus far 3 has 3 vehicles on the list.  Thus the total number of vehicles on the list is 3+3=5, therefore the total cars must have been 5 or 6.\nThus, based on the number of cars on the list, the total amount owed in these accidents must be:<<5+6=15>>15 accidents\nSo the final answer from Table 5 is 15\n\nInput:The average number of items that a person buys each year is $50.

He hired one person, and he kept the other 9 employees. The average salary of each employee was $7,000. If the owner needs to replace 9 people, what can he afford to pay them?\nOutput: If the average employee receives $7,000 in the payroll (which is half of the employees\u2019 salary) the owner can only afford to pay 9 people (which equals half of the employees\u2018 annual salary).\nTherefore, 9 out of 20 people do not receive $7,000 each.\nFor the remaining 7, they cannot afford the higher salary because they work in lower offices or they are not employees yet.\nThis means the owner cannot afford to pay 23 of 21 employees $7,000 each, and there is no money left to hire one of 3 people who earns less than $5000.\nThus, there are no more employees to pay than there were at the beginning. And so, because of the salary limits, there is no money for the third person so there is no additional payroll funds.\nSo the final result is there is no extra payroll money for the person to pay. And so, the person cannot pay his salary (which he owes).\nSo the final answer in order to allow the person to pay his salary, the extra payroll funds must be transferred to the other 9 employees via a share of the current pay which means that the final answer is \u201cNo\u201d\n\nInput and Output: The population of the entire nation exceeds 100 million.

The nephew would be coming to the party from school. John had purchased 40+ gifts for the nephew.  How many do you think John will be able to give to the nephew? What is John\u2019s total budget for the birthday party and gifts?\nOutput: 40+40+40%+20=>>40+.\nSo 40+40+40+20=<<40>40%\nSince John has to divide up the gifts among his nephew\u2019s parents, there will be 16 presents for each of the parents and 4 per child. If John gives each of his parents 32 presents, there will be 40 presents total for each of his parents.\n40-60+40+40%=<<40%>>40%\nThus, 40% is 0.40*40% = 10\nThus, the final answer is 10\n\nInput: The average cost for a new computer to be installed in an office is about $1,000 per workstation.

She tells a customer:  \u201cI\u2019m going to take this plastic bag, and put this pencil in here. When I pull this out, here\u2019s your new product.\u201d  Lisa then uses the pencil to help find the parts and tells the customer that when she pulls it out, she\u2019ll have the new product to the guy next to her. The customer then buys the item.  If Lisa takes the pen/graph paper with her, she puts the pencil in paper and writes down any problems or questions that the customer has. If the customer asks her questions that she can\u2019t answer, Lisa asks the customer to tell her what the problems or questions are. Then once the person has finished answering her questions, when he/she is finished and says that they want to leave, Lisa turns on his/her flash light and shows the customer that it has a flash light inside. The customer then leaves. Lisa writes down the names of the people she has interviewed and gives them the pencil with the pen/graph paper inside.  When a customer calls and inquires about a product, she asks him/her to write down what they wanted. Lisa then follows up and helps with the buying/selling process of the customer.

They set aside $18,850 each month and they invest it in a mutual fund. They also decide that they will donate a portion of the money they receive to charitable organizations that they support. What would the amounts be for each year?\nOutput: The yearly amount to donate to the charities will depend on the annual performance of the respective mutual fund. If the mutual fund reaches the target year for all their mutual funds, the donations will be the yearly amount to be set aside to each charity. If the mutual fund\u2019s performance exceeds the target year, the donations will be multiplied by 3.\nIf the mutual fund\u2019S performance exceeds the target year for all the funds, its donation will be the yearly amount set aside for the charity divided by 7.\nIf neither the mutual fund nor its total funds exceeds the target year for at least 15 of the mutual fund\u2019,s mutual funds, the donations to the charities will not be the yearly amount to each charity. Each charity to be donated to will be the annual amount set aside by that charity divided by 7.

There were 3.5 million people living in Egypt at that time.  In 1950 1 person in the country owned 300 livestock.  How many people will in 1950 still own 300 animals?\nOutput: It is difficult to speculate because of the uncertainty about the population changes. However, a conservative estimate based on the average number per family unit is 60.\nIn 1950, there were 100 farms per million people.  If population growth is 10% yearly then 6 farms per million people will be in 1950.  Given population growth, 5% yearly, 20 farms per million people will still be in 1950.\nIn 1950, 300 animals per family means 200 goats, 70 cows, 25 sheep, 5 pigs, 3 chickens, 3 geese, 2 goats, 2 cattle, 3 sheep, 1 dog, 2 cats, 1 goose, 2 goats, 1 pig, 1 goat, 1 horse, 1 cow, 1 bull, 1 sheep, 1 calf, 1 horse, 1 cat, 1 dog, 1 goat, 1 pig, 1 pig, 1 cow, 1 horse and 1 horse will still be owned in 2000.

The hospital charges $900 for medication, $350 for overnight stay, and $600 for food. For the bill for medication, what is the total cost?  Output: Total cost, in dollars, for the above medications is $900.\nWith the above bills on hand, Jim would have only $300 per day for medication. He will have to divide his $900 into 15 payments of $1.\nSince medication, $300, comes out of Jim\u2019s bank account, he uses this money to pay for medication. His overnight stay will come out of his savings account, and his food comes out of his retirement account. Since he is starting to go into retirement, his food money would go into retirement. Since he cannot save for retirement because he is under 25, the money will be given to him as well. Therefore, the money that comes out of his savings and his retirement account will go to Jim. This means that his $900 will cover the cost of a medication that is $6 per month.\nThus $600 will cover the cost of his medication, so $600 x 12 = $1800 for medication\nInput: The following statements are true: 1.

{"text": "A: antique store B+ cemetery C+ junk yard D+ ice\nIn the winter months, when ice melts, all of the accumulated ice that does not melt is left on the ground around your house.  You want to prevent this buildup of ice on the ground by taking a snow plow to the ice when it melts.  The plow dig a trench and dumps the ice into the trench.  A snow plow comes in and pushes all of the ice into your yard.  If you have your plow in a driveway, you can pick up excess ice in the driveway by using a rake or shovel. When there is excess ice over your garage, you can bring in a snowplow to collect the ice.\nWhere would you put the plow, the rake, and the shovel?  The plow should be in your house garage.  You can do this by placing the plow in front of your house on a curb or in your driveway.  The rake or shovel should be in your driveway or garage.  If you live in a community and there is an open driveway, or the residents have an open driveway, you can use your driveway.  If there is not enough room for the plow to park in your driveway or in your garage, you should think about moving the plow or the rake into the driveway as a temporary solution.  Once the plow has spent its time in the driveway, the rake or shovel can be picked up and moved to the driveway. However, you might not be able to get the plow out of the driveway in its entirety because it is in the way of something else.  If there is a driveway extension in front of your house, you might want to think about using that driveway instead of your driveway.  You need to keep a clear path of travel around your house so that someone doesn\u2019t get hit by a car or trampled by a dog coming out of a neighbor\u2019s house.  The shovel is needed mostly to move the melted snow from your driveway to a snow collection area.  If you put in a snowplow in your driveway and your garage and try to move the plow or rake to a sidewalk or street in front of your house so that other people can put a snowplow in their driveway when they need it, they might not be able to do this because of the way your driveway or yard is laid out.\nTherefore, you want to use a driveway in front of your house or in front", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

If the farmer only planted peas and no other crops, how much is the annual profit of growing peas?  Output:  If the annual profit of peas is $5,000, the average profit of vegetables would be $8,000.  The profit of carrots can not be determined.  However, $80,000 seems the most profitable vegetable (including corn and wheat, which would take a long time to grow).  Thus, the average profit of peas would be $5,000/year * 75 = $5,760/year\n\nInput: A farmer wants to move his crop from one part of the state to another that has a higher price.  In the state with the higher price he is in, he will have to pay a higher price to transport the crop to another state.  This is similar to how much his crop will sell for if he moves it to another state with a lower price.  So how much would his crop cost if they transported it to the other state?  Output: The total annual cost to move one grain of wheat between states would be the price obtained by dividing a farmer\u2019s total cost of the crop by the price of the grain.  So the total yearly cost to transport one grain of wheat between Kansas and Colorado would be $2,560.00\nThus, the average annual cost to transport one grain between Kansas and Colorado would $2,560.\nIf the grain is transported from Montana to California, the total cost to ship it from Montana to California would be $1,280.00.\nThus, the average price per mile to transport from Montana to California is $0.0775.\nTherefore, the average price for transporting one grain of wheat between Montana and California is $0.080\n\nInput: The total annual income of a family is $80,000.

They both receive $2000 per month each and plan on building on their 2.5 acre plot. However, Kevin knows he will need to get financing to build the house so that they can rent to the customers who love their products.  What should they do?\nOutput: 1) They choose the home site A house in the middle of a field 2) They select the house site B in the middle of a forest 3) They select the home site C in a place where there is a creek D) They build B D and A together\nSo for example, for A, a middle of a field is the middle of a field, and C is a place where there is no creek, so Kevin does B instead. For example, for B, a forest is a forest so Kevin does C instead. For example, A is at the top of the hill so Kevin needs to build the house A, and B is far to the east so he plans to build D D instead and then A together.\nSo B (and A) are closer to each other than A, and C is farther away.  And then Kevin will have to finance the house.\nSo for example, if Kevin picks A house, a middle of a forest is a middle of a forest, and D is farther away than A, then to finance the house D D, they will have to build D D, and A together. So for example, A, A, and B are all closer to each other than B, B, and C. So for example, a B house will be closer to C than a C house will be to D.\nSo for example B house is closer than A, A is better than C, and B, C, and D are all away from each other.\nSo for example A house, A (and C), and B house are all closer to each, D D, and C M are all too far, and then D M is far from C M and both B and C M are far from C.\nSo for example all three choices are better, more convenient, cheaper, etc.\nSo for example they can", "answer": "A: hear crowd go mad"}

They sell the house to a neighbor for $150,000. There are six bedrooms in this house, but only 4 people can afford to live there. Which 5 bedrooms will they need to rent out, and how much will it cost them each month?\nOutput: They will have to rent out all 6 bedrooms. Because they will only have 4 people living in this house, there are no longer any bedrooms that they need to rent.\nA person\u2019s yearly income is $2000, so her yearly income at $1500 per month is $1500*6 = $1500. The first night the family stays in this house is $1500. The second night\u2019s stay is $2000. The third night is $2400. Then for the next month they stay $2200. The fourth month\u2019s stay is the same (the bill for the second night will be $1300). The fifth month\u2019s stay, there are 4 people living in this 4-bedroom house, and it costs them $2700 to stay. The sixth month\u2019s stay costs them $2300, and there are 4 people renting out the 6 bedrooms for about $1700/month. The net cost is $1600/month to stay.\nSo the family will pay $1500 to stay in this 4-bedroom home for 2 months, $1600/12 = $1600\nAfter the 2-month stay, they will have to start paying for their own place again. For the first 2-months, the family can rent a small apartment complex that they\u2019ll stay at for $800. For the second 2-months the family can live at a big apartment complex for $400.

{"text": "A: the pet shops B: the white house C: garden of eden D: arctic\nSo the final answer it to A\n\nOutput:\nThere is a farmer who grew corn and was very happy with the production.\nIn October, the farmer bought a field of wheat but lost $7000 and was left with almost no field of wheat to harvest.  He sold the wheat to a company which bought it for $80 a bushel and sold it to farmers at a premium of $90/bushel.  He lost another $6000 selling the wheat to them.  So in November, the farmer planted his wheat in the empty field because he didn\u2019t have a market for the wheat.\nDecember brought warmer weather.  Instead of selling his winter wheat for $80/bushel, the farmer decided to plant his winter wheat at $82/bushel instead.  The farmer sold off his corn for $40 and a bushel of wheat for $40 and $40/1=<<40/1=55>>55 bushels.  He still lost $4000 but it was still better than in August.  So in November or December, the farmer planted his winter wheat at $98/bushel instead.\nSo in November, the farmer sold his winter wheat for $98/bushel and he still had a profit of $6000.\nBut in December, the farmer\u2019s winter wheat was sold for $89/bushel, so the farmer was left with a loss of $6000, still a profit of $6000, but not as much as in November.\nSo the total loss in November and December was $27000, leaving a profit of $20000.  But when January came around, the farmer sold off his wheat at $84/bushel.  It would have been profitable if the farmer had sold it this year for $80/bushell.  So the farmer was left with losses of $27000 and a profit of $20080\nSo the total profit was $20080 and the total loss was $27000, making a loss of $27000 per plant.\nSo the final loss was $30000 and the final profit was $20080.\nSo total crop loss*$30000 =$36000.40\n\nInput: It\u2019s a beautiful spring afternoon and the sky is blue and shining.

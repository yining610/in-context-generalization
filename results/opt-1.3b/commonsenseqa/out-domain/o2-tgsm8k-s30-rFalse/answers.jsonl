After a week, they have not seen each other. How can the two find each other?\nOutput: They have had some time together in the past, but never had much contact. They know that they once shared lunch together, which means that the chances of seeing each other is near. However, their family did not meet until the trip and so they have not seen each others family. Given the circumstances, would they try to make contact to find out what happened or would they not?\nOutput: A\nExplanation: The dogs parents, like the people they shared lunch with, know they were on the same field trip and may have given them directions as they left and may also know where they may be. The dogs parents might tell if they see the person next to them in class, which would mean that a connection was made or that the person has already shown that they know them and were with them at lunch. If they have not seen the other person, this would mean that they would not meet them because they are both in class at the same time and probably do not have a class together.\n\nAssignments\n\nThis lesson will be an introduction to a concept and will teach a simple fact that you can use to answer questions about it.

About five minutes later, he heard a knock at the door. He opened the door and a woman ran up to him pleading to let her pet the dog.

This is the more common spelling of the word, and the name for what we are describing is called the front of the wheel.  The second part of the wheel (the rear or the wheel) is called the rear or the tire. This type of torsion is one that is opposite the front, so it will twist in the opposite direction.  The second type of torsion, called B, is a direction in which a component can bend back the other direction.

Answer:  B   Both oil and gas require refining and pipeline transport of all components.   Thus the oil price is the price of crude oil with all components.\n4.  Answer:  G   Crude oil is the product of refining and marketing.\n5.  Answer:  Q      Crude oil prices are based on the expectation of supply and demand as well the effect of government policies.\n\nAnswer:  A  In equilibrium, the price of gasoline is lower if the gasoline demand is higher.  The higher gasoline demand is expected when there are fewer gasoline stations and if prices are higher at gas stations having little competition (i.e., near competition).  The higher the demand, the lower the supply is likely to be. (In this example from the Texas board of education we will assume a more limited range of demand. In fact there probably will be very little choice in the demand as the only competition will be from other stations that stock gasoline.)\n\nAnswer:  D  Oil prices should fluctuate as a result of changes in oil supply and demand from various sources.  Thus oil prices should also fluctuate as a result.

This wing needs to be strong enough to endure the forces of flight. How does the wing structure of the first stage differ from the wing structure of the fuselage? Outline the difference.\no An aircraft is a type of airplane; so, an airplane is, at the same time, the hull-and-wing structures of a plane.\no A part of an airplane is called a wing. Therefore, the wing is the structure that holds the airplane's body together.\no The structure of a plane is the top and bottom fin, the spar and the wing skin.\no The fuselage has several vertical flaps attached to it. The vertical flaps take up some space on a plane; so, by design, their wings are too small to attach directly to the centerline of the fuselage. The wing is attached to the horizontal flaps.\no Airplanes move because they have a very low center of drag. Since they move as a unit, they stay balanced when they make turns.\no The wing of a plane is usually at a lower elevation during nighttime flight than the rest of the airplane. This lowers drag and accelerates lift.\no Each wing has a thin tail section that is attached to each wing end. The thin-section tail section is designed to fly in a very small area. During normal flight, the tail section moves in the wind and sweeps the air away from the plane.\no Each wing also has a wing tip, which moves independently of the wing, and which is what you will use to hit the center line of a plane.\n####Input:a) Large tree\nb) a small tree\nc) another tree\nd)an airplane\nOutput:b) A) Large tree.\nB) c) other tree.\nA) L (not an airplane).\nC) D (Not an airplane).\nD) A (not an airplane).", "answer": "A: beast"}

This is correct. In total time it is 50 minutes. The question also questions which part of the route is counted. The two parts, \"drive 60 miles or less\" and \"drive 40 miles or less\", are indeed in equal amounts.

I was on the road before the town was even open. I went through the town at around 60 miles an hour and back into town at 60 miles an hour. I still got back to the town at almost the hour mark.

Calculate the net result.\nOutput: 60\n\nInput: A man is making $1,000/month and uses this money to \"retire.\"  For a year, he pays his bills by working 10 hours/day and spending $10/day on leisure activities.  In the year after working 10 hours/day, he works 20 hours/day, and spends $20/day on leisure activities; this adds $1,600 to his savings.  The change in spending doesn't add to the net result, because $1,600 is the difference between working 10 hours/day (instead of 20) and working 20 hours/day (instead/of 10).  This also reduces the amount of money he earns over the year.  Calculate the gross rate of return.\nOutput: 40%\n\nInput: Suppose Joe is driving to school, when he sees a car parked in the front of a business lot.

{"text": "foolhardy\n\nClick here to view this question in the Answers to questions page. For more explanations on these questions click here.\n\nAnswer by dave (Answer #19)\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nFatal Frame\n\nExplanation: For the example, let\u2019s suppose that we assume that 1,000,000 people are required to evacuate, and that the total number of evacuees is 100,000.\n\nSuppose that all that has remained after all of the evacuees (including the people left behind to work and live in the area) have been relocated safely, is 30% of the evacuee population. Now consider a catastrophic storm. Say that a Category 5 hurricane (meaning that the storm has sustained winds of more than 185 mph) lands near Corpus Christi, Texas. With a 90% confidence threshold, the storm would have to sustain winds above 185 mph for 16 consecutive hours to break the evacuation. (Even a Category 3 hurricane would be too much, and the storm would have to reach Category 5 status before the city would be seriously damaged.) And if an evacuation took place only once, no more than 60% of evacuees would be able to safely leave the city if the storm persisted for 16 hours.\n\nNow suppose a Category 7 hurricane makes landfall. Now assume that 60% or more of evacuees were able to leave the location before the hurricane made landfall. This means that more than 90% of the evacuees would need to remain in their evacuation zone while the storm is in the area.\n\nNow let\u2019s suppose a Category 9 hurricane made landfall while the storm is still here. This means that a catastrophic storm would need to have sustained winds of at least 185 mph for 16 consecutive days (without any break days) to break the evacuation. Assuming only 60% of evacuee population could safely leave the area, the evacuation zone would need to be over 50 miles from landfall or 60 miles from the city in order to break the evacuation.\n\nNow let me ask a question. Say a Category 5 hurricane does not make landfall. With a 90% chance of no catastrophic storms, what would happen? Suppose that everyone stayed in the area while the hurricane was here. What effect would this have on the evacuation? The 90% probability of no Category 5 hurricanes after Hurricane Sandy is in a way reassuring, because people would have to go through another storm before they could be relocated", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}

{"text": "None of these\n\nWhich of the following is not a verb: To use?  A: To use a word. B: To use a noun. C: To use an adjective.\nOutput: None of the above\n\nThis exercise is designed to help children (and adults!) gain a vocabulary of some 50 common everyday words (rather than the word of the day for today). For one, it forces students to do the work necessary to form and organize their thoughts, and make some decisions. And for another, it gets the students excited about the process of learning English and sharing knowledge, and maybe most importantly, working with the English language itself. The main purpose of this exercise is to help students think about the meaning of words, use them correctly and correctly spell correctly (as opposed to, say, using a word in its context), and have a good grasp of how English really works.\n\nIn previous years, students have done this exercise more as a form of \u201cvocabulary practice\u201d. For example, in third grade, I used it to \u201cteach\u201d students how to identify certain words in writing. I also use it to give students a general feel for how a noun and a verb or adjective are used together when forming a sentence or phrase. Now I am using it as a study guide and, I think, as a kind of \u201cliterature study,\u201d as well as a fun, fun way to challenge students to find their own vocabularies.\n\nOne of the nice things about this exercise is that it forces students to read different books, find words in them that they do not know (or not often), and practice writing sentences and paragraphs that use those words appropriately. They needn\u2019t have any advanced English skills to use this exercise, but they will get a lot out of it.\n\nOn a final note, this exercise will give students a chance to learn to use a computer, which is more often used throughout today\u2019s world than it is in traditional classroom settings. This also allows students to have a hands-on experience with Internet/electronic tools while practicing \u201creading\u201d and writing by looking things up on the Internet. (And for the record, they won\u2019t learn how to spell, write good essays, or understand English!)\n\nMy hope is that students will have as many fun and informative classes as they have fun and informative papers.\n\nWelcome to my first lesson!

What should be done?\nOutput:   10,000 lbs of feed\n\nIn the past week the number of active cases in the state has increased 17- and 25-fold from the previous week, while there have been a million extra visits to this site. A recent study showed that the number of infected people has increased by more than 8,000 compared to last week, and the peak is still yet to come.\n\nAll right, let's get started with something really easy and, I hope, as short as possible. Why is there a state ban on smoking in bars? The fact that it's in a bar is by design and is a matter of fact. There is no state-wide ban on smoking in other businesses in this state, and in fact it is a choice of individual establishments.\n\nSince there are not state-wide liquor license or other restrictions on where bar establishments may be located, you could be walking into a bar anywhere in the state to find someone smoking in a bar. There is no requirement of a smoking prohibition and, quite often, it is not enforced.\n\nBut the real problem with it is that there is a national ban on smoking, and the state law doesn't even match the federal statute, with the only difference being that \"bar\" in the federal statute means a place of business licensed by the government for selling liquor at a bar in a state other than the one in which the liquor license is held.\n\nThe other thing that a lot of people who ask this question do not realize about smoking in a bar is that it's totally legal to walk inside and sit anyplace in the room you are in and smoke.\n\nWhy is this? The main reason is that it is not only against the federal law, but also against state law to go to a bar and smoke. Smoking in a bar is a federal law, and the state law was designed not to prevent it, but to allow it to be practiced where it is legal. This means that in Texas, people can't go into a business and sit out there and smoke. But they can if they want to go in somewhere and smoke.\n\nSo this is a kind of bizarre answer to a question that, in any case, is pretty straightforward.

{"text": "496\n\nExplanation:\n\nResponse 1 (1%) : The reason why is simple: the people who decide the money is used for their use, and not for other people's, are the people who really need to give it back. So, if they decide to give back, it's for other people's use, and they shouldn't.\n\nResponse 2 (1%) : The answer is actually C): The reason why is pretty complicated, but mainly because it's kind of unethical to start giving money back, unless you can actually prove to this person that he is just using it for himself/herself. And only if he can prove to you that he knows.\n\nResponse 3 (2%) : The answer is B): The reason why is simple. These types of things are usually for people who want to receive money, as opposed to giving it back to the people who need it as much. So, it's just for the \"givers.\"\n\nResponse 4 (2%) : The correct answer is D): The answer is B): Most people will think of giving as giving and not as getting, especially in the case of money. Since they don't have a right to it, no one should give it to them. So, you shouldn't give it to him, unless you can be 100% sure he knows you intend to give it back. But if he really doesn't need it anymore, then you should go ahead and give it to him anyway. You don't know what he will do with it, and this way you won't lose it.\n\nResponse 5 (5%) : When the rancher told Jennie to check in a week or more before he left to move his cattle to higher ground, the first thing she should have done was to check his bank records to see if he had any outstanding loans.

Perhaps she believes that she has a right to the credit and debit transaction information that will allow her to take action with the bank if her debit card is stolen.\n\nResponse 7: The credit information could be a credit score, a balance on the account, etc.\n\nResponse 8: This question is directed to the individual in the bank. \"She\"", "answer": "D: make payments"}

What will cost you $10?\nOutput: 1\n\nThe person making the question needs to be an older female: 60+\n\nThe correct answer is (50,50,50)\n\nClick to expand...\n\nI don't think that this is true for older women, or at least older than 60 or so. Even if they're retired they generally get their social security checks and not much else (although I guess their pensions are another matter).\nEven if you count Social Security as wages you might have a hard time paying anything more than $15-$20 for gas. If you do you are either going to have to be on your feet all day or you're going to have to live from paycheck to paycheck, at least for a while. If you are retired then you are out of luck. Most people do not work the full 40-hour week. So unless you are out of a job you are not paying into a full system, whether or not there is an additional cost.\nBut hey, I'm retired and my gas tank is full. Good enough for me. And it took me at least four to five hours to fill and gas tank. So it's not like I'm totally screwed. It will still go through when I need it.\nThe \"other expenses\" don't really add anything to the equation so they are only worth about half of the expense from a financial point of view.\n\nAlso, as others have said, there's a very small difference between gasoline, diesel and heating oil (plus propane) prices. Add up your payments over 5 years and gas and diesel will add up to around $80 a month (or less for 1k miles/yr).\n\nThe correct answer will be 20.\n\nYou know, it's nice to know that a girl's brain is working so well that she couldn't even answer the question right.\n\nThe correct answer to question 2 is a bit more complicated since \"drive\" depends on the situation.

It has about 25,000 miles on it. The tractor is manufactured in 1988. The tractor\u2019s original oil was $5.01, while the two-wheeler\u2019s oil was $3.59. Therefore, the two-wheeler sells for $6,600 and the tractor for $4,400, and the net present value of the two-wheeler plus the tractor is $11,500. However, when subtracting the $1,000 depreciation in the two-wheeler, the two-wheel is worth $(9,500) and the tractor only is worth $(4,600). The new owner pays $2,600 for the two-wheeler and $3,900 for the tractor. The difference between the two-wheeler's NPV of $11,500 and the net present value for the two-wheel is $(2,600) - $(1,400)= $(3,700) = $5,400. Therefore, the net present value of both the two-wheeler (minus $5,400)(minus $4,200)/$4,900 is $(5,200) - $(2,900)= $(11,000) = $(10,600).

Net cash flow from the sale is $(15,600) + $(2,900)= ($16,200) + $(1,800) - $(5,400) = $22,400.  Therefore, net cash flow to start and $2,600 after $12,400 is $3,860.

They would also buy their own insurance and ensure that the man had health insurance.

He goes to Japan, spends $4,900 (in today\u2019s money), and writes a story about a beautiful Japanese girl.  He then sends the manuscript to his lawyer in order to gain a publishing contract.   After receiving his contract, the writer returns to America and ends up on a cruise liner with the beautiful Japanese girl, who he is in love with.  However, the girl ends up being with a guy from Mexico, so the American writer returns home without seeing the girl.  He is heartbroken and writes a story about how the girl must leave Japan and how he is in love with her.  The book begins to sell and the lawyer has a son who is studying to become a lawyer so he can get on a plane and travel to Tokyo to see the girl.  While there, they meet and fall in love and the author is heartbroken.  He can\u2019t believe that his book is being turned into a movie because it is exactly what he had hoped for the book.  He then goes and sees the original story in New York City, where it made its debut about 10 years previous and how it flopped.  When he is looking through the book from the first time, he is shocked to see that the character he had envisioned years before has grown to be a man-child.  He then goes to Japan to make the scene exactly the same he had imagined.  He gets his lawyer to sign a contract with the new company that wants to make the movie.  When he arrives home, the book is being turned into another book.  The lawyer asks him to send a second manuscript of the story the same way the first manuscript was done.  The publisher refuses to publish.  The story was rejected by its original publisher", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

The question will tell you the cost of your fuel per gallon, i.e. a gallon is one-fourth of a litre. This amount of fuel will cost one-quarter the price of one litre of gas.\n\nThe objective of this problem is to give you a mathematical formula for comparing the price of the fuel compared to that of the gas station.\n\nWhen a fuel station sells gas, they will need to account for their operating expenses. For example, they will probably pay for gas on a daily basis. This includes their electricity billing, their administrative costs and anything else they need to cover. On the same day, they then need to provide fuel to their customers.\n\nAs for your problem, you can use the same technique as the one I have described, which is to find their average. The only difference is in finding the difference between the cost of fuel and the gas price.\n\nExample of Using a Formula to Compare the Pricing of a Product- Price vs Total Price\n\nSuppose you have a product that can be sold at US$120 per unit cost: $110 for the plastic tubing, $5 for a label, $40 for adhesive.

The mechanic informs the family that it has a flat tire and asks if the family can borrow a truck to fix the flat tire.  The car is towed home, and the family asks permission to park the car.  The mechanic agrees, but warns the family that if the family uses the truck, the mechanic will ask for $200/day until the truck is paid in full.  The family decides to pay for the truck with the extra money they have.  This money can be used for anything you like.  The family can use the money to pay for gas, cellphones, snacks, groceries, clothes, whatever fits your current needs.  If you decide to pay for the truck, the mechanics bill will be paid through the credit card in the truck.  The remaining money will be paid back to the mechanic when the truck is sold.  The mechanics bill will only be collected if the truck does not sell through a car dealer.

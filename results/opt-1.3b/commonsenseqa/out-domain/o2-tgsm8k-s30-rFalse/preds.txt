After a week, they have not seen each other. How can the two find each other?<n>Output: They have had some time together in the past, but never had much contact. They know that they once shared lunch together, which means that the chances of seeing each other is near.

The dogs parents might tell if they see the person next to them in class, which would mean that a connection was made or that the person has already shown that they know them and were with them at lunch. If they have not seen the other person, this would mean that they would not meet them because they are both in class at the same time and probably do not have a class together.<n><n>Assignments<n><n>This lesson will be an introduction to a concept and will teach a simple fact that you can use to answer questions about it.

He went to try shopping in another grocery store but a bag of canned goods had gone missing too, so he headed to his favorite bakery to eat, but the bakery had a bag of goodies missing. He found himself wandering the streets trying to find a bakery that didn't have a bag missing. He was on foot and he was cold and hungry, he decided to keep wandering and he soon found himself in the back of a truck headed to a butcher shop where the only thing he had been able to find was a bag of beef. He opened his hand to catch a slice of beef from the truck but was shocked at the sight before him. The butcher shop's butcher department was loaded with meat and was crammed with bags of meat, all of them had some form of meat missing in them. All of the meat bags had no meat in them, they had no meat in them. No bread either! Now he was about ready to run over there and yell out to the people who were selling the meat what they had. He thought he got the meat from that butcher because the dog who owned the truck had been killed and the butcher had tried telling Jack he had killed the dog and no one believed him. After he felt better, he went back into the grocery store and found that they needed an ice cream maker, so he bought one thinking it would be easy to find something for himself. He opened the truck door to see the guy who worked the meat counter was no longer there, the guy was in the back of the truck putting the new ice cream maker together. When they both got a look at one of the new ice cream makers, it was so poorly made, the dog was almost stuck in it. He went ahead and bought it knowing that if the butcher told him to kill the dog for eating the old one, he would. He went into the house and put it down near the kitchen so he wouldn't forget it. About five minutes later, he heard a knock at the door. He opened the door and a woman ran up to him pleading to let her pet the dog. He thought she was in danger so he let her pet the dog while she cleaned off the dogs blood. It was a little girl who looked probably three or four years old. This little girl kept reaching into the truck hoping there would be something in there to grab. It was so sad but she kept coming back for more! She said

We'll use bifurcation to explain the following. There are two types of torsion that I will call A and B. A (the more common spelling) is a direction in which one component of the system will bend.  Let's try to explain a single bend by talking about this in a car's wheels.  The first part of the wheel (or tire) is called the front or the tire. This is the more common spelling of the word, and the name for what we are describing is called the front of the wheel.  The second part of the wheel (the rear or the wheel) is called the rear or the tire. This type of torsion is one that is opposite the front, so it will twist in the opposite direction.  The second type of torsion, called B, is a direction in which a component can bend back the other direction.  Let's talk about this the same way we described the first type of torsion by just using the word bifurcation.  The second type (B) of torsion is like

The bank, though, refuses to grant credit until he brings in a check book. The reason is that the customer's account is at a local credit union. A cashier tells the customer that it will be $3.85 and charges him $4. The clerk tells the customer that he is misunderstanding him. The customer then takes a photo of the credit card statement. He asks the clerk for the original $50 and pays with the credit card account in $50 increments, $100 at a time. The clerk does not charge any fee. A charge is then applied and the customer pays the full balance in cash. The bank does not want credit until a check for the remaining balance has been drawn. The customer demands to know why he has to go to the bank. The account is now negative, and the money cannot be reimbursed. A debit card is used to pay his meal and a $70 balance on the credit card is now available. The remaining balance on the credit card and the cash used for his meal are written down and added to a total balance of the original $50 from the customer's account. The statement from his local credit union notes a positive balance and a new account statement. The customer shows the manager the statement and the bank manager allows him to check his account and reimburse his meal. The debit card is also used to pay his balance on the credit card now available. The manager notes that the original $50 balance is refunded minus another $70 from the debit card balance. The manager's credit union representative asks the manager what he would do if the debit card account was negative (

At 5PM she felt she was about to lose it.  She went to her car, pulled out her BlackBerry and was about to send a text message to someone about her situation when she said to herself, “God loves you today.” And the thought hit her: “You see, the Lord loves me even when I am not in a good mood”  She realized that when you are having a bad day all you have got to do is remember God’s beautiful creation and he will lift you up again!  The message came straight to the heart of the woman and lifted her spirits right away.  As she sat in the evening reading through Psalm 37, she realized that she need to repeat some of the things she said to herself, and to God to help her forget all of the frustrations in her life.  As she did, she began to feel the Lord’s peace and comfort wash over her.  She felt more at peace than she had in days, and the only thing she wanted was to get out of her car and go sit with her family and get reacquainted after her afternoon of frustration!  As she sat in her car next to her family, talking and laughing and enjoying the evening and God’s wonderful creation, her husband came home from work and asked, “If I can have just one picture of you and God and your family and the things I think we should be sharing, what picture would you like me to get?”  His desire was for her to have a good attitude about everything, and in all of the frustrations of her life she forgot that she could trust God to carry her.  Just as God always carries us, she too needs to let go and trust God no matter what her situation.  God is always there to carry us and to lift our burdens and give us joy and peace.<n><n>Input: There was an accident that left a person paralyzed so they could not move.

Answer:  A  The price of oil is based on the expectation of global supply and demand as well as the effect of natural monopolies and government policy on price and supply.<n>3.  Answer:  B   Both oil and gas require refining and pipeline transport of all components.   Thus the oil price is the price of crude oil with all components.<n>4.  Answer:  G   Crude oil is the product of refining and marketing.<n>5.  Answer:  Q      Crude oil prices are based on the expectation of supply and demand as well the effect of government policies.<n><n>Answer:  A  In equilibrium, the price of gasoline is lower if the gasoline demand is higher.  The higher gasoline demand is expected when there are fewer gasoline stations and if prices are higher at gas stations having little competition (i.e., near competition).  The higher the demand, the lower the supply is likely to be. (In this example from the Texas board of education we will assume a more limited range of demand. In fact there probably will be very little choice in the demand as the only competition will be from other stations that stock gasoline.)<n><n>Answer:  D  Oil prices should fluctuate as a result of changes in oil supply and demand from various sources.  Thus oil prices should also fluctuate as a result.  Additionally, the government should provide for some level of price transparency.<n><n>The first problem is a general equilibrium model to show how energy prices can be determined.  The second problem is an example of a "discussed but not solved" model.  Note that this is an example from Texas education -- the "discussed

This wing needs to be strong enough to endure the forces of flight. How does the wing structure of the first stage differ from the wing structure of the fuselage? Outline the difference.<n>o An aircraft is a type of airplane; so, an airplane is, at the same time, the hull-and-wing structures of a plane.<n>o A part of an airplane is called a wing. Therefore, the wing is the structure that holds the airplane's body together.<n>o The structure of a plane is the top and bottom fin, the spar and the wing skin.<n>o The fuselage has several vertical flaps attached to it. The vertical flaps take up some space on a plane; so, by design, their wings are too small to attach directly to the centerline of the fuselage. The wing is attached to the horizontal flaps.<n>o Airplanes move because they have a very low center of drag. Since they move as a unit, they stay balanced when they make turns.<n>o The wing of a plane is usually at a lower elevation during nighttime flight than the rest of the airplane. This lowers drag and accelerates lift.<n>o Each wing has a thin tail section that is attached to each wing end. The thin-section tail section is designed to fly in a very small area. During normal flight, the tail section moves in the wind and sweeps the air away from the plane.<n>o Each wing also has a wing tip, which moves independently of the wing, and which is what you will use to hit the center line of a plane.<n>####Input:a) Large tree<n>b) a small tree<n>c) another tree<n>d)an airplane<n>Output:b) A) Large tree.<n>B) c) other tree.<n>A) L (not an airplane).<n>C) D (Not an airplane).<n>D) A (not an airplane).

This is correct. In total time it is 50 minutes. The question also questions which part of the route is counted.

I didn't realize how much time they would add up to. The total driving time for me was not that much at all. I got away with it because my speed was going pretty fast when I went to town. I was on the road before the town was even open. I went through the town at around 60 miles an hour and back into town at 60 miles an hour. I still got back to the town at almost the hour mark. My total driving time was probably 40 minutes. If I had known that the total driving time for the answer was 250 minutes I would have known that the total drivingtime for the answer could be less, which would of course, add up to a lower, therefore, correct, answer:<n><n>Total time for both parts divided by 2<n>140/2 = 0.28<n><n>Here is the correct answer; the total driving time is 50 minutes.<n><n>I just want to thank those of you that

The owner buys two tractor trailer units with a total capacity of 6,500 lb., and moves the elephants into his own storage containers. He then sells an auction for 5,000 lb. of the trailers, and buys a third 5,000-lb. container with a 2,500-lb. weight capacity. The container is then placed at a private residence in Texas which has a storage capacity of 10,000 lb., and which belongs to the owner of a professional basketball team. The owner tells his team owner, „We‘ll rent the space to the NBA or we will have to move all of them, too.“. The NBA‘s teams and the owners of the professional basketball team rent a total of 955 lb. of space inside of a 5,500-lb. container, and each owner pays an estimated $2,640 per week to use the space.<n><n>Input: What is the estimated annual income that Jello would have earned if she had kept her wedding ring?

They save 35% on all home expenses for the entire year, and have $25K remaining for saving at a time when the new-home values are highest.  A friend, "Dave," helps Bob plan for this expense.  During the month of August, "Dave" buys a house with a down payment of $65K.  This adds $40K to the savings, but decreases the amount of future saving for the couple, because they are no longer purchasing a $100,000 home.

For a year, he pays his bills by working 10 hours/day and spending $10/day on leisure activities.  In the year after working 10 hours/day, he works 20 hours/day, and spends $20/day on leisure activities; this adds $1,600 to his savings.  The change in spending doesn't add to the net result, because $1,600 is the difference between working 10 hours/day (instead of 20) and working 20 hours/day (instead/of 10).  This also reduces the amount of money he earns over the year.

It would be a waste of time to write each one and mail it, so they simply use the website www.freehoteltips.com to get the information they need in the first place. A business owner in Mississippi sees the free hoteltips.com page and is thinking:   “Now, I only need to tell my other customers about them.”    However, because the website tells him that he has sent out over 600 e-mail solicitations which was never planned, he thinks again and decides that the web page would be a waste of effort even though his customers could already access it in their own way. So, he decides to print out the newsletter, staple it to a piece of paper, and send it directly to them.    At the same moment, five more e-mails come in, and he begins to think “I know, I could tell all my customers about all these new free hoteltips.<n> .. but how do I deliver it without wasting any more time?’”    One of his marketing specialists suggests the following: if he puts it in a plain envelope and drops it in some mailbox that nobody checks over much, then the e-mail will not be noticed.   However, if he puts it in somebody’s mailbox, and only checks it twice a day, then it will be picked up by the postman.    Of course, he decides that he wants to be sure that it gets into the right person's mailbox.    Now the decision becomes clear: if his customers are going to be surprised by it, he has to tell them.  So he writes a small introduction to each newsletter: “Dear reader, It’s me again. I’m glad you were able to read us. Your subscription fees don’t always cover all the advertising we do, so every now and then when we can, we send you free hoteltips. This is the third newsletter (not five) in as many months. If you’re not signed up already, or if you’re not sure whether to become a reader, please call (insert number)!’”  The response is overwhelming, but the owner is still not sure what to do next: send out more newsletters; or try one or two of

I have other tenants available, but I’ll do a discount to the married couple." The couple can rent the room by the hour, or on a full-time, one-month lease for $125, or $175 from 9-6.

Now consider a catastrophic storm. Say that a Category 5 hurricane (meaning that the storm has sustained winds of more than 185 mph) lands near Corpus Christi, Texas. With a 90% confidence threshold, the storm would have to sustain winds above 185 mph for 16 consecutive hours to break the evacuation. (Even a Category 3 hurricane would be too much, and the storm would have to reach Category 5 status before the city would be seriously damaged.) And if an evacuation took place only once, no more than 60% of evacuees would be able to safely leave the city if the storm persisted for 16 hours.<n><n>Now suppose a Category 7 hurricane makes landfall. Now assume that 60% or more of evacuees were able to leave the location before the hurricane made landfall. This means that more than 90% of the evacuees would need to remain in their evacuation zone while the storm is in the area.<n><n>Now let’s suppose a Category 9 hurricane made landfall while the storm is still here. This means that a catastrophic storm would need to have sustained winds of at least 185 mph for 16 consecutive days (without any break days) to break the evacuation. Assuming only 60% of evacuee population could safely leave the area, the evacuation zone would need to be over 50 miles from landfall or 60 miles from the city in order to break the evacuation.<n><n>Now let me ask a question. Say a Category 5 hurricane does not make landfall. With a 90% chance of no catastrophic storms, what would happen? Suppose that everyone stayed in the area while the hurricane was here. What effect would this have on the evacuation? The 90% probability of no Category 5 hurricanes after Hurricane Sandy is in a way reassuring, because people would have to go through another storm before they could be relocated

C: To use an adjective.<n>Output: None of the above<n><n>This exercise is designed to help children (and adults!) gain a vocabulary of some 50 common everyday words (rather than the word of the day for today). For one, it forces students to do the work necessary to form and organize their thoughts, and make some decisions. And for another, it gets the students excited about the process of learning English and sharing knowledge, and maybe most importantly, working with the English language itself. The main purpose of this exercise is to help students think about the meaning of words, use them correctly and correctly spell correctly (as opposed to, say, using a word in its context), and have a good grasp of how English really works.<n><n>In previous years, students have done this exercise more as a form of “vocabulary practice”. For example, in third grade, I used it to “teach” students how to identify certain words in writing. I also use it to give students a general feel for how a noun and a verb or adjective are used together when forming a sentence or phrase. Now I am using it as a study guide and, I think, as a kind of “literature study,” as well as a fun, fun way to challenge students to find their own vocabularies.<n><n>One of the nice things about this exercise is that it forces students to read different books, find words in them that they do not know (or not often), and practice writing sentences and paragraphs that use those words appropriately. They needn’t have any advanced English skills to use this exercise, but they will get a lot out of it.<n><n>On a final note, this exercise will give students a chance to learn to use a computer, which is more often used throughout today’s world than it is in traditional classroom settings. This also allows students to have a hands-on experience with Internet/electronic tools while practicing “reading” and writing by looking things up on the Internet. (And for the record, they won’t learn how to spell, write good essays, or understand English!)<n><n>My hope is that students will have as many fun and informative classes as they have fun and informative papers.<n><n>Welcome to my first lesson!

She is still weak but she wants to walk around the block as often as possible. She feels a faint spot in her chest and takes a pregnancy test. It is positive. A couple of days later she begins having faint, painful back pains, which get to be so bad that she can barely stand it. She calls her doctor who suggests that she get the pregnancy test again. When she does another test, which takes longer than the first, the test shows a second negative line. The doctor tells her that she has advanced precancerous ovarian cancer and needs to get a CAT scan immediately to make sure there is no spread of the cancer. The woman then decides to call her doctor and cancel the CAT scan. A few hours later, she is told the scan is positive for cancer and that she needs to return to the hospital immediately for chemotherapy. She does not want to leave her son; however, she realizes that she needs to get through this difficult time as fast as possible. She finally takes the CAT scan and leaves the hospital two hours after she is pronounced cancer-free. She drives home and then a month later heads back into the hospital to make an appointment with the oncologist. In the interim, she begins to notice that her breast is tender to the touch and that there are no swollen lymph nodes. After making an appointment with the on-call oncologist, she is given the all clear to continue her chemotherapy treatments. The doctor calls and tells her with no pain or swelling, she does not need the chemotherapy and they will let her continue to exercise. But they now require her to call daily in order to monitor her progress. She also has to continue taking the daily pill to make sure her liver and adrenal glands do not shut down as her cancer does. When she leaves the hospital, she realizes that she had begun to change her behavior and that she no longer feels any pain and swelling in her chest area.<n>Input:<n>The woman's doctor asks her a question.<n>Answer:<n>"The car and its equipment are very convenient.

Three weeks later, a coyote entered through the fence with four of his cows and two calves.  What should be done?<n>Output:   10,000 lbs of feed<n><n>In the past week the number of active cases in the state has increased 17- and 25-fold from the previous week, while there have been a million extra visits to this site. A recent study showed that the number of infected people has increased by more than 8,000 compared to last week, and the peak is still yet to come.<n><n>All right, let's get started with something really easy and, I hope, as short as possible. Why is there a state ban on smoking in bars? The fact that it's in a bar is by design and is a matter of fact. There is no state-wide ban on smoking in other businesses in this state, and in fact it is a choice of individual establishments.<n><n>Since there are not state-wide liquor license or other restrictions on where bar establishments may be located, you could be walking into a bar anywhere in the state to find someone smoking in a bar. There is no requirement of a smoking prohibition and, quite often, it is not enforced.<n><n>But the real problem with it is that there is a national ban on smoking, and the state law doesn't even match the federal statute, with the only difference being that "bar" in the federal statute means a place of business licensed by the government for selling liquor at a bar in a state other than the one in which the liquor license is held.<n><n>The other thing that a lot of people who ask this question do not realize about smoking in a bar is that it's totally legal to walk inside and sit anyplace in the room you are in and smoke.<n><n>Why is this? The main reason is that it is not only against the federal law, but also against state law to go to a bar and smoke. Smoking in a bar is a federal law, and the state law was designed not to prevent it, but to allow it to be practiced where it is legal. This means that in Texas, people can't go into a business and sit out there and smoke. But they can if they want to go in somewhere and smoke.<n><n>So this is a kind of bizarre answer to a question that, in any case, is pretty straightforward. This will come as a

So, if they decide to give back, it's for other people's use, and they shouldn't.<n><n>Response 2 (1%) : The answer is actually C): The reason why is pretty complicated, but mainly because it's kind of unethical to start giving money back, unless you can actually prove to this person that he is just using it for himself/herself. And only if he can prove to you that he knows.<n><n>Response 3 (2%) : The answer is B): The reason why is simple. These types of things are usually for people who want to receive money, as opposed to giving it back to the people who need it as much. So, it's just for the "givers."<n><n>Response 4 (2%) : The correct answer is D): The answer is B): Most people will think of giving as giving and not as getting, especially in the case of money. Since they don't have a right to it, no one should give it to them. So, you shouldn't give it to him, unless you can be 100% sure he knows you intend to give it back.

Even if they're retired they generally get their social security checks and not much else (although I guess their pensions are another matter).<n>Even if you count Social Security as wages you might have a hard time paying anything more than $15-$20 for gas. If you do you are either going to have to be on your feet all day or you're going to have to live from paycheck to paycheck, at least for a while. If you are retired then you are out of luck. Most people do not work the full 40-hour week. So unless you are out of a job you are not paying into a full system, whether or not there is an additional cost.<n>But hey, I'm retired and my gas tank is full. Good enough for me. And it took me at least four to five hours to fill and gas tank. So it's not like I'm totally screwed. It will still go through when I need it.<n>The "other expenses" don't really add anything to the equation so they are only worth about half of the expense from a financial point of view.<n><n>Also, as others have said, there's a very small difference between gasoline, diesel and heating oil (plus propane) prices. Add up your payments over 5 years and gas and diesel will add up to around $80 a month (or less for 1k miles/yr).<n><n>The correct answer will be 20.<n><n>You know, it's nice to know that a girl's brain is working so well that she couldn't even answer the question right.<n><n>The correct answer to question 2 is a bit more complicated since "drive" depends on the situation.

(e.g. home insulation)<n>Output: $7,500<n><n>Input:  How much is $7,500.00?  Output: The NPV of adding a product line is the NPV of $.<n>Output<n><n>The two-wheeler was manufactured in 1962. It has about 25,000 miles on it. The tractor is manufactured in 1988. The tractor’s original oil was $5.01, while the two-wheeler’s oil was $3.59. Therefore, the two-wheeler sells for $6,600 and the tractor for $4,400, and the net present value of the two-wheeler plus the tractor is $11,500. However, when subtracting the $1,000 depreciation in the two-wheeler, the two-wheel is worth $(9,500) and the tractor only is worth $(4,600). The new owner pays $2,600 for the two-wheeler and $3,900 for the tractor. The difference between the two-wheeler's NPV of $11,500 and the net present value for the two-wheel is $(2,600) - $(1,400)= $(3,700) = $5,400. Therefore, the net present value of both the two-wheeler (minus $5,400)(minus $4,200)/$4,900 is $(5,200) - $(2,900)= $(11,000) = $(10,600). This amount ($10,600) /$11,500= $1,000 / $11,500 = $(1,800) / $16,200= $(1,000) / $18,600= ($1,900) / $24,800= $(4,000) / $32,800= $(5,400) / (5,200)/(5,600). Net cash flow from the sale is $(15,600) + $(2,900)= ($16,200) + $(1,800) - $(5,400) = $22,400.  Therefore, net cash flow to start and $2,600 after $12,400 is $3,860.  Since the two-wheeler dep

This will hurt you economically- how would you respond?  If you are a homeowner, the savings will be enormous.

The police officers approached the car and asked to see the driver's license.  The driver told them that is not allowed on campus, so the officers returned and looked for their license in the car.  They found the license in the center console.  The license belonged to a student and had a blank space for an "A" or "B" grade on it.  The officers asked the student how she knew that this college was on the campus, and he told the officer, "I'm from out of town."  The officers also asked the student how she remembered where she was. She explained that she remembered living in an apartment complex outside the city a few blocks away.  The police then asked the student if she had her phone.  She said that she did not have her phone.  The officers then asked the student if there was another car in the complex.  She said no and that she had gotten in the car and driven past the building. The officers said that's crazy because she's not supposed to be on the campus.  They then searched the car and found the license in the middle console. The police said "That doesn't make much sense.  We don't give out car licenses to out of town students.  Did you get off campus?"  She said she had not, so the officers drove her car to a nearby fast-food restaurant so that he could tell someone from campus with a college student's license.

The first guy was driving so poorly, they found a flat tire. Then the second guy got pulled over, and the first man was so wasted, the first guy had to jump into his car to drive the driver home. The police asked both men about the situation, and the first guy told them both they looked like fools. The second guy only spoke to the cops in Spanish. He was so drunk, he couldn't even answer the question. The cop didn't really care that much -- but the second guy's lawyer wanted payment for the time it took to drive home with two drunk drivers in his car. The second guy gave the lawyer the money, but the lawyer didn't believe him because he wasn't drunk. The driver gave the lawyer an out, though: he could drive home by car to his friend if he wanted to. The lawyer accepted the deal.<n>Output: S<n><n>Solution:<n>The first guy looked foolish, and the second guy got a "weird" job, and it cost him his job.  This is a very simple answer, but it is interesting, in that both the driver and the lawyer think that giving up their jobs was the best thing that happened to them.  Both of them saw the funny side.  Both were very close to each other, and they both missed them a lot.

He goes to Japan, spends $4,900 (in today’s money), and writes a story about a beautiful Japanese girl.  He then sends the manuscript to his lawyer in order to gain a publishing contract.   After receiving his contract, the writer returns to America and ends up on a cruise liner with the beautiful Japanese girl, who he is in love with.  However, the girl ends up being with a guy from Mexico, so the American writer returns home without seeing the girl.  He is heartbroken and writes a story about how the girl must leave Japan and how he is in love with her.  The book begins to sell and the lawyer has a son who is studying to become a lawyer so he can get on a plane and travel to Tokyo to see the girl.  While there, they meet and fall in love and the author is heartbroken.  He can’t believe that his book is being turned into a movie because it is exactly what he had hoped for the book.  He then goes and sees the original story in New York City, where it made its debut about 10 years previous and how it flopped.  When he is looking through the book from the first time, he is shocked to see that the character he had envisioned years before has grown to be a man-child.  He then goes to Japan to make the scene exactly the same he had imagined.  He gets his lawyer to sign a contract with the new company that wants to make the movie.  When he arrives home, the book is being turned into another book.  The lawyer asks him to send a second manuscript of the story the same way the first manuscript was done.  The publisher refuses to publish.  The story was rejected by its original publisher

The mechanic agrees, but warns the family that if the family uses the truck, the mechanic will ask for $200/day until the truck is paid in full.  The family decides to pay for the truck with the extra money they have.  This money can be used for anything you like.  The family can use the money to pay for gas, cellphones, snacks, groceries, clothes, whatever fits your current needs.

In 2010 the median household income was almost $48,000, which translates to roughly $50,000 per year for a family of four (mother, father, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law). The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in La Crosse is $800 monthly. In 2009, a new apartment complex opened right next to a gas station and grocery store. It has 400 apartments, each costing $650 to $700 per month. In 2012 the apartment complex was sold with plans to build an underground garage for parking the cars. The plans include a 5,500 square foot underground garage and a 20,300 square foot underground garage with a parking space that is 830 to 920 feet long. The garage will also be used for retail sales and construction of the new underground parking garage.

They spend about $3000 per month on food as a family. This is a good number to include if you want to give a reasonable number for a family of four to pay per month for food. A family of four with income of $45,000 would spend $1000 per month for food when they are at home alone. The average per person rent that a family of four pays for food is $716. How much is that for 4 people? If we assume that they live in a one-bedroom apartment, they would pay $12.25 per person, or $60 per month. The cost of rent of a two-bedroom unit in San Bernardino would be $3,280 per year. So, if the

As soon as he opens the hatch, the animal does not move. The lab technician then makes use of the equipment to measure the time taken by an animal to jump into a car with one hand and run to its owner. The first animal takes less then 2.5 seconds to reach its owner, but it takes 8 seconds to run from the car to its owner when the technician raises the rear hatch from floor level to about eye level. In subsequent tests, one animal took 1.3 seconds to reach the owner and another 8 seconds in these tests. The animals were conditioned to run toward the owners, or away from the owners, in response to their owner taking the rear hatch off the floor and opening it with one hand. At first all animals ran toward their owners, and then as the owners took off the rear hatch, the animals ran away from the owners. Both the average time to reach the owner and the difference in time between animals with and without the hatch to their owner were 1.4 seconds.

After a search, the dogs owner returned and brought the dog home. The dog was found to be in excellent health, though quite dehydrated.  The dog was examined and taken to the vet. The vet examined a small lump on the dog's tongue and said that it appeared to be cancerous. The vet then injected a lethal dose of chemotherapy into the dog. The dog wiggled its head and hissed as much as possible while undergoing the procedure. The vet then said "Here's a little pupper for you." He said, "I'll miss you so much, Momma, for sure", then proceeded to give the dog a nice bath.  The dog lay dead in the bathtub.  The funeral was held on Monday.  The family placed an order of pappy and mammy. They sent the dog's ashes with the deceased's body to bury together. They were cremated. At home, the family dug a shallow grave around the dog's skeleton. After a week of washing clothes and muck away from the dog's corpse, the family placed the funeral pappy and mammy in the shallow grave. The grave was now covered with weeds.  On the day of the funeral, the neighbors came by, to put some flowers on the grave to honor the dog that had gone to be with the lord.  It was then, that the family noticed an odd sight up ahead.  They noticed the mouthing of a small dog that looked like a puppy! The dog then appeared to move. To this day, no one knows what happened to that little puppy.

He has three children: Mary, Brian, and Tom. They are all in their twenties and live all over the country. Barry graduated from high school in 1982, received his education in 1987, and got his car license in 1991. He has been a mechanic and owns his own business since. He has worked at his own shop for 23 years. He also owns a large tract of property by the water. Barry and Rose met because Barry saw Rose walking a dog in the park. They became friends and married in 1989. Barry is very close to his children, his brother, his wife, and his parents. Barry and Rose love going out to lunch and movies. They have been married for 37 years. They travel as much as possible in their personal vehicles and rent cars at car-rentals. The family used to have a van, but now they rent a vehicle with the company of two others. Because of budget cuts, Barry and Rose decided to lease two cars, and both of them ride in the passenger seat and the driver sits in the back. Due to this, Barry and Rose will be going to a local restaurant this week. They want to make sure they order the exact same items. Barry said, “My family is like a huge extended family, and I’d like to go to every single one of their weddings. This weekend I will go to two weddings.” The restaurant is in their hometown, but the wedding is far away from his home. Because the restaurant is relatively close to his mother’s home, Barry will be driving the two kids there instead of the children getting in a car together.

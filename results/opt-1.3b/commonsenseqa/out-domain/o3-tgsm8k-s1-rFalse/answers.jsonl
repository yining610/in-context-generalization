Since your grocery bill is only $250 a week, the extra $100 that you receive will be much less than your grocery bill would be, even if you did not receive any cash at all. However, the money goes into the same account that you use for grocery purchases.\n### Answer: D. It's not true that money is a good thing. If you have $1,000 in your account, you can afford to spend it at any time. This is true only if you need the money right now, since if you saved the money instead of spending it, you wouldn't need it right now. Money is only good if it gives you the freedom to spend it.\n### Answer: B. Money IS NOT your happiness. The way that money can improve happiness is by changing the direction of your life. For example, if you have $100 in your account and there is a lot to do, you'll enjoy all the money in your account. If you don't have $100 in your bank account, you won't enjoy all the money in you bank account, even if you were able to spend it. Happiness is not money. It's simply freedom from the drudgery of boring old life.\n\n### Question #7.

Use your credit card, your card is your debit card, you would just prefer cash.\n### Answer: C. You need to start spending your money more wisely as well as learn how to use your credit card more wisely. Don't spend it all up in one day, every day. Save up a credit card balance for a specific time period, as well as using cash most of the time.\n### Answer: A, C. Saving helps you buy the things that you really want, or things that you don't need right now. Spending your money will often lead to regret once you are out of credit.\n\n### Question: It's Friday morning. You", "answer": "B: container"}

{"text": "6\nHow Many Choice: 5? 4?\n[Answer: E]\n\nThe following worksheet will help children think about how a change in their daily life might affect them. They will be given five minutes to think of one change that would help them get out of their daily routine. Each family member should have one minute of input. The family should also decide how they may choose to help. The family should not change or affect anything until everyone has had a chance to think. When the families have made their choices they should write down their answers.\n\nThe table below should give you the ideas about five things that might help your child get out of their normal routine.\n\n#1: If you have ever played in your school yard, in your neighbor's yard, or even around your own house.\n\n#2: If you do not want to do something everyday.\n\n#3: If you get out of your school yard to play basketball or volleyball or to go to the store.\n\n#4: If you are not allowed to play in the school yard and have to go to the neighbors to play on their play area\n\n#5: If you go down to the neighbors and help them to make cookies or even to make a new floor.\n\nThe last three choices are usually the things that would be the most difficult for your child to change. The child might like to play at the neighbor's house or go to your own house once a week but the neighbor would not like this to happen.

What do you think it looks like?\nWhat can you do at home to help your child change his routine\nwhat can you do at the next playground to help his friends change theirs\nwhat can your children do by reading to each other, or watching a friend\n\nThe more kids are involved the more fun it will be. Everyone wins\n\nTry not to force the change, or go too heavy handed.

In which part of the map will the following two colors appear - red and blue?\nOutput: 7.5\n\nInput:The answer to this problem is:If you are married, your spouse will pay half of your child support payments.  If you are single, your spouse will pay for child support, but you will never have to pay anything in child support payments.  For all intents and purposes, you are paying for the child support in a double-barreled system.  This means that your portion of child support is paid by your spouse, and your portion is paid by non-spousal income.  For example, if your child is $400 per month for his expenses, you would be paying $340 per month in child support payments, but his portion of family support payments would be split between your family and her family. In the past when I took care of my sister and a cousin from the same family, I made payments on their behalf.  She went by their names because they were paying for school, but I assumed that she and her family wouldn't even pay for their own tuition.\nOutput: 6.9\n\nInput/Output (C) (C) An airplane flies from New York to Los Angeles.

Suddenly, the mechanic notices that water is leaking from behind the radiator case. The engineer decides to look behind the radiator case but can't find it, so he calls in a leak detection team. The repairman tells the engineer to remove the rear panel of the car and remove the two front wheels so he can look behind the radiator. The engineer is able to find the leak and tells the mechanic not to worry because the coolant is still within a leak test pressure range. The mechanic tells the engineer that if a water pipe is damaged inside the radiator case (which it is) the water will seep up the radiator and flood his garage. The engineer decides the only way to get a water leak is to make an air seal between the radiator and the engine block. To make this air seal he uses a bolt cutter and a saw. It works! After this he decides to remove all radiators and add air sealing in the future. The mechanic is ecstatic, and the engineer tells him that he owes him $100 for his time. The mechanic does not realize that he owes the engineer and is happy that his new air-sealing job is getting him a raise. The mechanic does not find himself owed $100 because he doesn't get the job back, so he asks his insurance company for $100.00 for labor. The mechanic does not ask for the money back, and even though he has never done a job anywhere before, he accepts the offer.

There are two more children that are allowed to mow your lawn.  Each child has his/her money ready.  The two kids who will be charged with mowing the lawn are Zach and Mary.  Mark will need his allowance today to buy a bike for $100.  Let's say that the four children who are allowed to mow the lawn are all very good and very well mannered. One is a girl, one is a boy, two are a boy and a girl.\nLet's say that Zach is charged with mowing the grass and Mary is charged with babysitting.  Zach has the most money ready to babysit for the price of $7 per hour for two hours.  Zach will be paid $2 for each child that will help him mow the lawn. So, Zach will make $13 for each hour he is babysitting.\nLet's say Mary is charged with babysiting for the price of $12 per hour for two hours at a time.  Zach will make $15 for each hour he is mowing the lawn.  Zach will be making $30 for each hour he is watching Mary babysit.  Zach will be taking home $80 for watching Mary babysit.\nThe total amount of money Zach requires will be $30 x 12 X 2 = $72.  This means the total amount needed to purchase the bike for $100 is $72.\nThis $72 includes the cost of the bike itself (cost of the bike) plus a $7 fee that is charged to each child for each hour that is babysitting.  For Mary and Zach a total of $52 will be returned to them.  This amount can go up or down depending on how much Mary or Zach contributes to cleaning up after the boys at the end of the two hours with the boys.

It doesn't sound like it is a complex problem (ie the chore list is confusing him), so I'd suggest that it should be quite easy for him to come with a list of things you need, if you're willing to make a list beforehand.\n\nIncluding \"grocery\" on the shopping list is probably more likely to get you an answer about what you mean than \"candy bar\" since his mother is likely not going to buy him just a candy bar, but a whole chocolate bar.

In addition to the music the iPods plays, it also plays a variety of videos and other kinds of content, including a TV.  After several days John has approximately 50,000 songs, about 80% of which are movies.  Based upon this information he is able to get approximately 200 hours of entertainment out of the iPod.  At $79.95 per month, one hour of audio is worth $2.99.  Assuming John wants to play 3 hours each day, this would lead him to have approximately $7.74 each time he played the iPod.  Assuming only one hour of audio played each day John would need to earn approximately $4.38 per month before he was able to play all 100 songs for free.  Considering that the iPod costs $149.95 he'd also need to earn approximately $3,500 per month before being able to buy the entire iTunes Music Store.  This is enough for John with good time management skills to earn a college degree for approximately $2.25 per hour.  Assuming he earns $1 an hour per day this would translate into $3,500 to buy the entire Music Store over 12 months.  Based upon an average 40 hour work week this would earn him approximately $4,200 before he was completely able to afford to buy the entire Music Library.  Assuming he earns an additional an average of $10 per hour each week he could potentially bring home approximately $8,000 before he was completely able buy the entire Music Library before the 12 month period is over.

{"text": "The company wants to get money for expansion. It wants to raise capital for better equipment, training, and hiring. To do this it plans to sell its shares publicly in the next few months.\nOutput: The company does not care about the value of its shares. Rather, it cares about its customers and employees. It will make an acceptable offer to these two groups before making the shares available for investors.\nOutput: The selling stockholders realize that the current share price could be much higher. Thus they realize that they would be stupid to buy shares for less than the price the company will likely trade at in the public market.\n Output: The selling shareholders realize that the current share-holder stockholders may be out of luck. That is, they may never be able to buy a share of the company for their entire investment. Thus they sell their shares at exactly what shares are considered to be acceptable to investors.\nOutput: Investors take into consideration all possible situations in trading options.

In case he sells well below the higher price he will buy at, he will sell at the higher price. After the sale he can take his money from his tax-safe account and continue investing in other products.\nOutput: 3) Mark's stock will still be trading at a very reasonable price due to its excellent earnings, new products, and its low stock price. Thus he will continue to invest his money in other products.\nInput:  The stock is going to drop on Tuesday. What should Mark buy tomorrow?  The options that have already expired aren't in his favor.

So 464.2 = 7.22\n\nBut if I use that as the number of total stickers on the front page (ie 17 x 2), then 464.2/170 =.75, which I guess equals 464.2, or 75%. (or so I surmise.) But then, that answer is wrong too.\n\n(My answer is wrong as well, if we assume that there are stickers on the other pages as well as on the front page. I know they're different because I counted the stickers on the front page.)\n\nSo you are right to the person who finds this to be the number of pages - and I am wrong to the person who finds my answer to be the number of stickers. But what about how many stickers are left on the other pages?\n\nNow, let's assume that there are 13 random stickers on the right page, and there are 5 stickers on the left page. The total number is 967 x 515 = 1150. But then, the question asks for 5 stickers on the left and 967 on the right - which makes it 597 x 1154 = 1125. It is actually even in that case.\n\nAnd lastly, what about the question on the left? I know there are 5 stickers that you can't find on the left page. So 2 x 967 would equal 2 x 967. However, 1 x 515 is.947 - it is exactly what it says in the question. So it's actually.947 x 515, just not as expected. It is a little disconcerting.", "answer": "B: wedding party"}

{"text": "2\n\nInstructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput\n\nOutput\n\n1. 1:1 ratio.\nThis is a ratio in which all the units of a certain quantity are equal to the sum of its parts, while some units produce less; the ratio of a quantity to its parts is called a 1:1 ratio.  Suppose that it takes 60g of sugar to make 1kg of sugar.  The total weight of sugar in the syrup is 60g/kg. If you have 60g of sugar in a 1kg bottle of syrup, then you can estimate the volume of the syrup as:60g\u2013 60g\u2013 60g/(1:1)(1/3\u2013 1/3)\n2. 2:2:1 ratio\nThe ratio of a quantity to the remainder (or to a unitless quantity, in case the remainder is smaller) is called a 2:2:1 or a 2:2:0 ratio.  The ratio of 5kg of sugar to 1kg of flour is 2\u00bd:2\u00bd.  If you have 5kg of sugar in a 1\u00bdkg box of flour, then you estimate the volume of flour as:5kg\u2013 7\u00bdkg\u2013 6\u00bdkg/(1:2)(1/2\u2013 1/2)\n3. 1:2:3 ratio\nThe ratio of 3kg of flour to 1kg of sugar is 2\u00bd:2\u22c52\u00bd.  If the ratio of sugar to the flour is 1\u22c53\u22c51\u22c51, you estimate the volume of the dry flour as:3kg\u2013 1\u22c52\u22c51\u2295\u00bd\u2295\u2295\u22c52\u2295\nIn each case, a 1:2:0 ratio is the same as a 2:2: 1.", "answer": "B: two ears"}

Select A: she will be thrilled to help you improve B: she will get you attention C: she will say something harsh D: she won't help at all\nOutput: D\n________\n\nAnswer: D\n\n1.) How is this a test about math concepts vs what is it about the way people study math in general?\n\nThe math concepts are:1. There is a finite number of variables in every equation. (2. There is nothing more to be learned about the way people study mathematics than that you have to look at the total number of variables in the equations before you try to solve it.)3. An ideal study of Mathematics involves two groups working together and exchanging information. (4. There is no secret to studying. No secret that you need to keep to yourself - it's how you study that counts.)2.) How is it about the way that people use mathematics to practice and how people try to improve in the knowledge area that there is a test that is all math?\n\n4. In some ways, the \"how\" of mathematics in this test makes it not a test about the concept. A lot of it can be learned in the context of a course - a lot of it can be taught in the context of an interview or a test - but there are certainly not \"no secrets\" that you can use to study or improve in this area. The \"how\" is as important as the math itself.\n\n5. An interesting aspect of the question is that it asks questions about how people practice math, not how they think about, or how they know what to study.\n\nMy personal opinion is that people have very strong interests in and ideas about math. If not mathematics itself, then there is a strong interest in the ways in which the concepts of mathematics are applied \u2013 that is, how it is used in the general world \u2013 and many different ways that it is used.\n\nOne of the aspects of the test that I would argue is a problem is that because questions about the study of math are not as difficult as questions about the study of other subjects, the questions that are more difficult, in this test, make it harder to find answers for the easiest questions. In this way, it would be easier to study math than any other subject, because there are too many variables but the average test-taker might not even realize that in", "answer": "C: play piano"}

I think it\u2019s a great idea to share your ideas with other students and to get first hand responses from other teachers.\n\nHere is a sample email that my two year old (who is in the second year of my 6th grade class) sent to my students this week.\n\nDear Mr. teacher,\n\nI'm doing very well with my schoolwork this morning. I was a bit tired last night though. Anyway, I found some pictures on the Internet that I would like to draw. I want you to study my drawings. I love drawing pictures. You told me to draw different things, but I did draw the same thing over and over.\n\nI think that my drawing is about the sun and it is on the floor. I draw it like it does. I want you to draw it for me. If you draw something so that I can see it, tell me if it is the same thing that I drew before. Also, in a paper, say what I drew or something that I drew.\n\nFor example, I drew the sun on the ground in a paper (that I wrote over). If I told you about my paper, can you draw the paper? And what I drew in the paper. I want you to learn the things I did in my paper.\n\nSo you see, just draw the pictures and you will learn something new about me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary\n\nShe continues to show me her drawings throughout the day and I never let her keep them. I keep them and help her study each one.\n\nWhen I look at her drawings I don\u2019t see how she can get all the details of her drawing", "answer": "B: feel good"}

{"text": "12.\n\nIntermission\n\nIn the second hour of the program, the \"Inner Circle\" is presented.  The program then begins with \"The Hooray Listening Party\".  This program features students at various schools in the District participating in the Hooray Listening Listening Club.  Students may write to their favorite song on a note pad, e-mail it to their selected song, or post it on the program or website. Students must have an explanation or reason why their favorite song is the best.  This is one of the main features of the program that students like; it gives them a chance to get to know their peers and teachers and for their ideas to spread more widely.  As the program continues, students will learn that in order to be included in the list of artists that will be featured on the website, students must submit a minimum of 500 words in an online voting poll.  After the poll is closed, the most complete songs will be presented.  The songs that most students choose will be featured first.  This time, students may vote with one hand for one song and with the other hand for more songs. The second hour of the program ends with the announcement of the first four artists that will be featured online soon in a special live broadcast on the program.\n\nSpecial Programs\nThe next morning, students have the opportunity to participate in the Program Director's Report.  This program features students around the District who have some unusual hobbies or interests.  This program is normally a half hour presentation with a question and answer session following.  As the program has students present about their hobby, they ask questions from the audience to each other.  In the past, these programs have included songs, stories, photographs, drawings, poems, and games.\n\nThe program then offers additional special programs and programs are featured at the beginning and end of the week.  These special programs are usually in the form of music, dance, film, puppetry, and video, but as the program has gone on, these presentations have included other things.  For example, the program has discussed current issues such as the Bush Administration and education in the past.\n\nVouchers\nThe last Friday of the regular school year is usually the last time the staff has the opportunity to review the vouchers.

He said he was disappointed in how his parents handled his education but thinks that there's something to be said about the importance of education and he sees his parents as good, honest people.  He said he loves to play soccer.  I told him that that wasn't a very nice thing to say about his parents and that he should try and forgive them as their education was hard work and there was no guarantee that his education would even get to college.  I suggested that he consider a college where he could be happy for the rest of his life. What do you think?\nOutput: I said it was pretty uncool to be so angry and then say he should forgive his parents. I said he should realize that it's probably not the time or place to ask forgiveness and to just focus on his happiness at that point.  He said he was proud of his dad. He said he'd be able to say, \"Yeah, I was that dumb kid that my parents struggled with.  And yeah, I made bad choices but I love my family and I'm proud that my parents tried and I'm proud they worked hard to pay us back for school.\"  He said he's always known that he wanted to be a carpenter.  He said he can't stand his family's friends because they're just too nice to him. He said he's in debt to a carpenter that stole his shoes once.  He said there are some things he doesn't like about them and thinks they're kind of a dumbshit. I asked him if they're worth paying him.  He said they won't be worth anything to him so he's not going to give them to them and he said they'd eventually lose interest in the shoes they'd taken. It seemed like a pretty simple question and he was in a pretty awkward mood and I didn't want to make him mad again but I had to give him some kind of answer. I told him that while I still think that", "answer": "C: plain"}

Their friend lived in France and came to meet them the next day.  The next day Heather went on a tour of Paris and took pictures of the landmarks.  While at the restaurant Heather noticed her friends cat running through the place.

I boil until the vinegar is dissolved.  The salt and salt salt make the pasta.  The eggs turn out perfectly every time.  The first 2 tries, I put the salt mixture on the pan right after cooking the pasta and add the eggs, but now I use the salt mixture as I stir it.  When the pasta begins to get watery add the eggs next.  There is no need to put salt on the top of the eggs.  The amount of salt is not critical to the taste and it's very hard to over add salt.  I have a friend who doesn\u2019t like the texture and she uses salt to make the mixture.  If you add too much salt, you can still use the pasta if it\u2019s still fresh but it's not the same.

Paul called the ticket office and spoke to someone who was very nice.  He agreed to give Paul his friend's $5000.  The man at the phone asked Paul a few questions as to how he was feeling.  The man then told Paul that he was a very generous man.  Paul was overjoyed because his hard work had paid off.  The man then handed them a check for $50,000.00.  He informed Paul that he appreciated him giving his ticket to a poor person like that.  He gave them a piece of his mind.  Paul later told him that he was giving his ticket to charity, but the man still told him that it was a nice gesture.  Paul told him that if he gave Paul half of his money and let it go, he would have a rich friend.  Paul went into his truck and returned to his trailer.  He opened the door and started to drive off to his trailer.  After looking around he realized that he had no money in his truck.  He started to feel very upset because he could have saved up a lot of money by now if he wouldn't have wasted his ticket on a lottery ticket.  Paul called the phone number on the check and called to ask for help.  The man on the other end of the line asked what he was doing.  Paul told him about his ticket.  Paul explained that it's not a ticket anymore and that he gave it to some friends and it's going to charity.  The man told him that he should've given Paul the money.  Paul felt discouraged.  He didn't want to tell the man what he did.  So he stayed quiet.  He was going to try and get money for it today.  He was hoping to borrow money in order to try and get his \"friend\" some of the money.  He called the following number.  The number was working.  Paul", "answer": "E: university"}

That extra $10 he will get as a bonus after he mows the yard would be $35.  The savings account that Zach's parents will pay him has a return of 2.5 percent.  The bank account of A's parents would bring them back $25.  The bank account that A's friend would get from Mark (assuming he has the same amount of interest) would bring him back $95.  The bank account is most efficient if you are guaranteed to get a return.  If Zach were guaranteed a return and then Mark was guaranteed a return too, the efficiency of the program would depend on the number of clients Zach would have.\nOutput: $5.00\n\nIf A makes a one-dollar bet with B at the end of the game, then B loses by paying $10, then A would make a one-dollar bet again with A at the end of the same game.

Mark is the student captain of the basketball team  at school, but has his friends tease him.  He wants to let them know it is the opposite of what is happening in the locker room, but instead he makes his friend Zach a scapegoat.  If Mark could convince his friends to support Zach with their actions rather than just being passive-aggressive and keeping it quiet, he knows he can make Zach stand out in the stands and he can get the attention he feels is missing.  He needs their support badly and he feels Zach will be the star player on the team.  What strategies would he use to increase Zach's popularity?\nOutput: Zach and Mark are twins and Zach is the less popular one at school. The basketball team leader, Kevin, was very mean to Zach and he felt he could be a scapegoat and get attention  from all the other boys on the team  because no one will ask him to do the team practices for free because it is a very popular sport in his school.

How does his alcoholism affect others?\n\n**Discussion**\n\nIt seems to me that it is better to be a drunk guy who owns all the things that you want with no debt than a sober guy who owns only the things you want but no money.  You can still do a lot with your hands and without money.  A drunk guy who will spend a good chunk of time cleaning up the messes he makes can be pretty damn useful when he decides to start working.  The same is true for someone who doesn't really drink.  He can still use his brain and his eyes to keep things neat.  A guy like Zach can use his hands and his eyes quite effectively when it comes to looking nice.  While it would be a lot easier if you could just pick up the things that you wanted with no money, we can't do that and we know that Zach will have to work for the money he will have to use to buy things that he will like with no money.\n\nWhy is it better for Zach to use his hands and eyes than his head and his legs?  Could it be because Zach is more comfortable using his hands and his eyes?  Could it also be because Zach has more time to choose what he wants and what he needs?  Zach has more time to spend on the things that he enjoys or would enjoy spending money on?  This is all speculation at the moment because we don't know how Zach uses his imagination.  If Zach was only given an allowance once maybe he is more likely to spend his money on things that have nothing to do with beer.  The most important is to decide for yourself what are the things that you want but Zach can't afford if you only give him a small allowance because it would take his mind away from other things that he might be interested in or have fun with.

Do it as many times as you think they will notice and as many times as you are allowed to do so. Remember to never let your parents hear you say it, because they will probably say yes anyway. Also, if they say yes, don’t say “But we aren’t allowed to take home the money” or “But your mom has to sign for the money” because that would be lying and your parents will know better than to say no. Make sure that you don’t start paying attention until they are doing a “no” and only then are you supposed to keep paying attention. Make sure your attention span is long enough for them to get their points across and then they will let you know when they feel done.

What are the first steps that should be taken to start the exodus?<n>Output: 5<n>If a country has a small military, the people are likely to run to the protection of the military when it is needed.  The military should be established early because it would be easier to train the military when the country has a smaller population.  The military should also be formed earlier because it would be needed even after the people abandon the country, the army would still be needed.  If the military is established early enough, by the time war enters, most of the people would have fled.  The military would have to be established so slowly because the country has only a small group of troops in a defensive position.  A small group of troops is easily trained, but not so easily established.  There should also be plenty of supplies in the military because when war erupts, most of the people will be trying to evacuate at the same time so it would be impossible to establish the military without a large supply.  Eventually the military would be formed and used.<n>Output: 15<n>The military would be helpful because of the size of the country.

Since your grocery bill is only $250 a week, the extra $100 that you receive will be much less than your grocery bill would be, even if you did not receive any cash at all. However, the money goes into the same account that you use for grocery purchases.<n>### Answer: D. It's not true that money is a good thing. If you have $1,000 in your account, you can afford to spend it at any time. This is true only if you need the money right now, since if you saved the money instead of spending it, you wouldn't need it right now. Money is only good if it gives you the freedom to spend it.<n>### Answer: B. Money IS NOT your happiness. The way that money can improve happiness is by changing the direction of your life. For example, if you have $100 in your account and there is a lot to do, you'll enjoy all the money in your account. If you don't have $100 in your bank account, you won't enjoy all the money in you bank account, even if you were able to spend it. Happiness is not money. It's simply freedom from the drudgery of boring old life.<n><n>### Question #7.

Use your credit card, your card is your debit card, you would just prefer cash.<n>### Answer: C. You need to start spending your money more wisely as well as learn how to use your credit card more wisely. Don't spend it all up in one day, every day. Save up a credit card balance for a specific time period, as well as using cash most of the time.<n>### Answer: A, C. Saving helps you buy the things that you really want, or things that you don't need right now. Spending your money will often lead to regret once you are out of credit.<n><n>### Question: It's Friday morning. You

They will be given five minutes to think of one change that would help them get out of their daily routine. Each family member should have one minute of input.

The first question is: suppose you have a map with all the countries marked in it.

If you are single, your spouse will pay for child support, but you will never have to pay anything in child support payments.  For all intents and purposes, you are paying for the child support in a double-barreled system.  This means that your portion of child support is paid by your spouse, and your portion is paid by non-spousal income.  For example, if your child is $400 per month for his expenses, you would be paying $340 per month in child support payments, but his portion of family support payments would be split between your family and her family. In the past when I took care of my sister and a cousin from the same family, I made payments on their behalf.  She went by their names because they were paying for school, but I assumed that she and her family wouldn't even pay for their own tuition.<n>Output: 6.9<n><n>Input/Output (C) (C) An airplane flies from New York to Los Angeles.

Suddenly, the mechanic notices that water is leaking from behind the radiator case. The engineer decides to look behind the radiator case but can't find it, so he calls in a leak detection team. The repairman tells the engineer to remove the rear panel of the car and remove the two front wheels so he can look behind the radiator. The engineer is able to find the leak and tells the mechanic not to worry because the coolant is still within a leak test pressure range. The mechanic tells the engineer that if a water pipe is damaged inside the radiator case (which it is) the water will seep up the radiator and flood his garage. The engineer decides the only way to get a water leak is to make an air seal between the radiator and the engine block. To make this air seal he uses a bolt cutter and a saw. It works! After this he decides to remove all radiators and add air sealing in the future. The mechanic is ecstatic, and the engineer tells him that he owes him $100 for his time. The mechanic does not realize that he owes the engineer and is happy that his new air-sealing job is getting him a raise. The mechanic does not find himself owed $100 because he doesn't get the job back, so he asks his insurance company for $100.00 for labor. The mechanic does not ask for the money back, and even though he has never done a job anywhere before, he accepts the offer.

Choices:  A: inspiration B: much work C: boredom D: graduate E: degree<n>Output:		 a: inspiration B: much hard work C: graduation D: degree E: degree H: debt-free I: a D C D E E D E<n><n>Output: You will receive your allowance after your two dollars have been given to your parents.  There are two more children that are allowed to mow your lawn.  Each child has his/her money ready.  The two kids who will be charged with mowing the lawn are Zach and Mary.  Mark will need his allowance today to buy a bike for $100.  Let's say that the four children who are allowed to mow the lawn are all very good and very well mannered. One is a girl, one is a boy, two are a boy and a girl.<n>Let's say that Zach is charged with mowing the grass and Mary is charged with babysitting.  Zach has the most money ready to babysit for the price of $7 per hour for two hours.  Zach will be paid $2 for each child that will help him mow the lawn. So, Zach will make $13 for each hour he is babysitting.<n>Let's say Mary is charged with babysiting for the price of $12 per hour for two hours at a time.  Zach will make $15 for each hour he is mowing the lawn.  Zach will be making $30 for each hour he is watching Mary babysit.  Zach will be taking home $80 for watching Mary babysit.<n>The total amount of money Zach requires will be $30 x 12 X 2 = $72.  This means the total amount needed to purchase the bike for $100 is $72.<n>This $72 includes the cost of the bike itself (cost of the bike) plus a $7 fee that is charged to each child for each hour that is babysitting.  For Mary and Zach a total of $52 will be returned to them.  This amount can go up or down depending on how much Mary or Zach contributes to cleaning up after the boys at the end of the two hours with the boys.  This amount will be returned to them in the form of coupons that give the children money back to buy groceries for tomorrow.  Mary and Zach will get all 12 coupons, so they are going to need to spend some money if they want to get everything for tomorrow.<n>Suppose that the four children at the ends of the two hours play football in the yard.  They will all need money from their allowance to buy snacks

If you already consider him to be "very generous" then it sounds like your allowance is more along the lines of $7-8 (or maybe you don't know your child very well).<n><n>At this point all you can do is ask for more from the parent to be able to get your work done. So if your job is really that much more difficult than his (which it really should be), then that is something that will need to be clarified.<n><n>The first thing to do is to clearly describe the work you need done. It doesn't sound like it is a complex problem (ie the chore list is confusing him), so I'd suggest that it should be quite easy for him to come with a list of things you need, if you're willing to make a list beforehand.<n><n>Including "grocery" on the shopping list is probably more likely to get you an answer about what you mean than "candy bar" since his mother is likely not going to buy him just a candy bar, but a whole chocolate bar. Unless the child gets into mischief for getting it in the wrong bag, in which case he will probably be more likely to get it back out of there when you ask him to fetch it. So you may have to explain something like "You can buy a chocolate bar or a basket if you want to," or perhaps "We have enough groceries at home to get by until you have dinner, but you could take a basket with you if you want?" If it doesn't come back to bite you on the backside then it may be fine. Of course the risk is that your child might choose to buy you the candy bar yourself, and then spend it in the wrong place.<n><n>Now if you expect him to do other chores, and he continues to

In addition to the music the iPods plays, it also plays a variety of videos and other kinds of content, including a TV.  After several days John has approximately 50,000 songs, about 80% of which are movies.  Based upon this information he is able to get approximately 200 hours of entertainment out of the iPod.  At $79.95 per month, one hour of audio is worth $2.99.  Assuming John wants to play 3 hours each day, this would lead him to have approximately $7.74 each time he played the iPod.  Assuming only one hour of audio played each day John would need to earn approximately $4.38 per month before he was able to play all 100 songs for free.  Considering that the iPod costs $149.95 he'd also need to earn approximately $3,500 per month before being able to buy the entire iTunes Music Store.  This is enough for John with good time management skills to earn a college degree for approximately $2.25 per hour.  Assuming he earns $1 an hour per day this would translate into $3,500 to buy the entire Music Store over 12 months.  Based upon an average 40 hour work week this would earn him approximately $4,200 before he was completely able to afford to buy the entire Music Library.  Assuming he earns an additional an average of $10 per hour each week he could potentially bring home approximately $8,000 before he was completely able buy the entire Music Library before the 12 month period is over.  Based upon the above information he would have earned $11,000 before he was ready to buy the Music Store prior to the 12 month period being over.<n>Input:  1<n>Output:  1

Just pay them that exact amount and thank them.<n><n> (Your response is wrong in this case.)<n>Output: 50<n><n>Click to expand...<n><n>I like this game...<n>I am also a bad person.<n><n>In answer to your question, I suppose I should put up the question.<n><n>It's 711 x 672.  So 464.2 = 7.22<n><n>But if I use that as the number of total stickers on the front page (ie 17 x 2), then 464.2/170 =.75, which I guess equals 464.2, or 75%. (or so I surmise.) But then, that answer is wrong too.<n><n>(My answer is wrong as well, if we assume that there are stickers on the other pages as well as on the front page. I know they're different because I counted the stickers on the front page.)<n><n>So you are right to the person who finds this to be the number of pages - and I am wrong to the person who finds my answer to be the number of stickers. But what about how many stickers are left on the other pages?<n><n>Now, let's assume that there are 13 random stickers on the right page, and there are 5 stickers on the left page. The total number is 967 x 515 = 1150. But then, the question asks for 5 stickers on the left and 967 on the right - which makes it 597 x 1154 = 1125. It is actually even in that case.<n><n>And lastly, what about the question on the left? I know there are 5 stickers that you can't find on the left page. So 2 x 967 would equal 2 x 967. However, 1 x 515 is.947 - it is exactly what it says in the question. So it's actually.947 x 515, just not as expected. It is a little disconcerting.

He painted works of art over his canvases and gave people the art to use in their own home.  Mary was able to select the book because of pictures on the back.  She then found an artist's website and she was able to see what was included in the book and it did not have pictures because it was digital.  Mary finished the reading and decided that it was interesting.  She put the book in her journal and then she took a quiz about it and it ended up being true. This week Mary learned that Andy Warhol was a good artist and that the only way to be good at art is to have an artist's eye. She then took the quiz and found out Andy Warhol was an artist. She was able to put the book in her notebook to refer back to later.<n><n>Monday, January 22, 2018<n><n>Today is World Health Day.

Suppose that it takes 60g of sugar to make 1kg of sugar.  The total weight of sugar in the syrup is 60g/kg. If you have 60g of sugar in a 1kg bottle of syrup, then you can estimate the volume of the syrup as:60g– 60g– 60g/(1:1)(1/3– 1/3)<n>2. 2:2:1 ratio<n>The ratio of a quantity to the remainder (or to a unitless quantity, in case the remainder is smaller) is called a 2:2:1 or a 2:2:0 ratio.  The ratio of 5kg of sugar to 1kg of flour is 2½:2½.  If you have 5kg of sugar in a 1½kg box of flour, then you estimate the volume of flour as:5kg– 7½kg– 6½kg/(1:2)(1/2– 1/2)<n>3. 1:2:3 ratio<n>The ratio of 3kg of flour to 1kg of sugar is 2½:2⋅2½.  If the ratio of sugar to the flour is 1⋅3⋅1⋅1, you estimate the volume of the dry flour as:3kg– 1⋅2⋅1⊕½⊕⊕⋅2⊕<n>In each case, a 1:2:0 ratio is the same as a 2:2: 1.

Select A: she will be thrilled to help you improve B: she will get you attention C: she will say something harsh D: she won't help at all<n>Output: D<n>________<n><n>Answer: D<n><n>1.) How is this a test about math concepts vs what is it about the way people study math in general?<n><n>The math concepts are:1. There is a finite number of variables in every equation. (2. There is nothing more to be learned about the way people study mathematics than that you have to look at the total number of variables in the equations before you try to solve it.)3. An ideal study of Mathematics involves two groups working together and exchanging information. (4. There is no secret to studying. No secret that you need to keep to yourself - it's how you study that counts.)2.) How is it about the way that people use mathematics to practice and how people try to improve in the knowledge area that there is a test that is all math?<n><n>4. In some ways, the "how" of mathematics in this test makes it not a test about the concept. A lot of it can be learned in the context of a course - a lot of it can be taught in the context of an interview or a test - but there are certainly not "no secrets" that you can use to study or improve in this area. The "how" is as important as the math itself.<n><n>5. An interesting aspect of the question is that it asks questions about how people practice math, not how they think about, or how they know what to study.<n><n>My personal opinion is that people have very strong interests in and ideas about math. If not mathematics itself, then there is a strong interest in the ways in which the concepts of mathematics are applied – that is, how it is used in the general world – and many different ways that it is used.<n><n>One of the aspects of the test that I would argue is a problem is that because questions about the study of math are not as difficult as questions about the study of other subjects, the questions that are more difficult, in this test, make it harder to find answers for the easiest questions. In this way, it would be easier to study math than any other subject, because there are too many variables but the average test-taker might not even realize that in

Jack and Lori are in charge of their family budget.  Since they don't have any money in their own savings, they decided to borrow $25,000 from money that Mom and Dad have left over from selling the farm and from their own money.  This money is $15,000 and $10,000 that their parents leave to them after paying bills.  They plan to pay the 15,000 in 3 years.  However, because their kids are 3 and 5, there is going to be some financial responsibility for them.  They decided to have the baby before the baby got too old to handle the responsibility yet so they can focus on having the child.  They also felt that the baby should have an English name that wasn't his first name because the kids wouldn't know what he was called, so a middle name made the most sense for them.  They will wait 5 years and save for the baby to be able to handle the financial responsibilities by buying a house after saving another $25,000.  Their current house is only worth about $600

The program then begins with "The Hooray Listening Party".  This program features students at various schools in the District participating in the Hooray Listening Listening Club.  Students may write to their favorite song on a note pad, e-mail it to their selected song, or post it on the program or website. Students must have an explanation or reason why their favorite song is the best.  This is one of the main features of the program that students like; it gives them a chance to get to know their peers and teachers and for their ideas to spread more widely.  As the program continues, students will learn that in order to be included in the list of artists that will be featured on the website, students must submit a minimum of 500 words in an online voting poll.  After the poll is closed, the most complete songs will be presented.  The songs that most students choose will be featured first.  This time, students may vote with one hand for one song and with the other hand for more songs. The second hour of the program ends with the announcement of the first four artists that will be featured online soon in a special live broadcast on the program.<n><n>Special Programs<n>The next morning, students have the opportunity to participate in the Program Director's Report.  This program features students around the District who have some unusual hobbies or interests.  This program is normally a half hour presentation with a question and answer session following.  As the program has students present about their hobby, they ask questions from the audience to each other.  In the past, these programs have included songs, stories, photographs, drawings, poems, and games.<n><n>The program then offers additional special programs and programs are featured at the beginning and end of the week.  These special programs are usually in the form of music, dance, film, puppetry, and video, but as the program has gone on, these presentations have included other things.  For example, the program has discussed current issues such as the Bush Administration and education in the past.<n><n>Vouchers<n>The last Friday of the regular school year is usually the last time the staff has the opportunity to review the vouchers.

He has a third brother that is really dumb. In high school he had to be smart to get a scholarship to college, and because he knew he was smart he was given an extra class to take to complete his graduation and so he failed it. He has dropped out.  His parents paid his $2,000 in college loans.  He is studying to become a carpenter. He said he was disappointed in how his parents handled his education but thinks that there's something to be said about the importance of education and he sees his parents as good, honest people.  He said he loves to play soccer.  I told him that that wasn't a very nice thing to say about his parents and that he should try and forgive them as their education was hard work and there was no guarantee that his education would even get to college.  I suggested that he consider a college where he could be happy for the rest of his life. What do you think?<n>Output: I said it was pretty uncool to be so angry and then say he should forgive his parents. I said he should realize that it's probably not the time or place to ask forgiveness and to just focus on his happiness at that point.  He said he was proud of his dad. He said he'd be able to say, "Yeah, I was that dumb kid that my parents struggled with.  And yeah, I made bad choices but I love my family and I'm proud that my parents tried and I'm proud they worked hard to pay us back for school."  He said he's always known that he wanted to be a carpenter.  He said he can't stand his family's friends because they're just too nice to him. He said he's in debt to a carpenter that stole his shoes once.  He said there are some things he doesn't like about them and thinks they're kind of a dumbshit. I asked him if they're worth paying him.  He said they won't be worth anything to him so he's not going to give them to them and he said they'd eventually lose interest in the shoes they'd taken. It seemed like a pretty simple question and he was in a pretty awkward mood and I didn't want to make him mad again but I had to give him some kind of answer. I told him that while I still think that

She told her mother that she had made her a list and was going to read it before going to her trip.  Her mom was a bit concerned but was excited to learn of Heather's ambition.  She was going to have a look around Europe and wanted to visit a few different countries as well.  After getting ready Heather went to the grocery store to buy some food.  She had the total cost of her trip about $300 before her trip and knew what she needed to buy.  At the end of the week she got to Europe and met her friend.  Their friend lived in France and came to meet them the next day.  The next day Heather went on a tour of Paris and took pictures of the landmarks.  While at the restaurant Heather noticed her friends cat running through the place.  Heather's friend thought that their cat had ran off because everyone talked to the cats and didn't pay attention to them like Heather and her friend did.  Heather's mom tried looking for the cat while they spoke, but couldn't find it.  Heather was quite upset at this and felt that there had been something wrong with their cat.  While shopping around Heather came across an internet store that carried some cat costumes.  While she was wearing her costume in Europe Heather would visit the website and would order one of her costumes for the cat.  She wore the costume on her trip the following day and felt like she was walking around pretending to be a cat.  By the end of her trip Heather was happy with the experience.  On the way home Heather brought money back to the grocery store with a friend of hers from Europe.  Heather used the $200 to buy a large pizza for dinner that night.  She did this for the next two nights and then decided not to go to sleep at night because her friend had been nice to her and made her feel so special.<n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n><n>Input:The girl was bored so she made a spreadsheet to plan out how to spend her summer.

An Indian is so poor he doesn't even know what a bus is.  However, when he does, he realizes that a bus is "busy" and has no wheels.  His first bus trip was to the bus depot.  He arrived and asked the driver "How much?"  He was told that he had to pay 1 rupee to board the bus (R 1).

Then the students will choose 3 other photos to draw the pattern, and the teachers will draw 4 additional animals. In this lesson, the children’s teacher chooses their photos to be animals that they like to draw.<n>Output: 9<n><n>Output:What if the teacher tells children that they can draw circles using only 5 stickers, with no other markings?  After drawing one circle (the elephant), the students choose another 5 stickers to draw the elephant from.  When the teacher asks: What do they draw for the circle?  The animals draw the same 5 animals. Does this mean they didn’t notice that the teacher placed the stickers in the right order? Does the teacher do a double check before labeling?<n>Output: B<n>- - - - - - -<n>Output:The teacher tells the children that they will have 2 hours to draw the circle pattern. In the second hour, the teacher brings in some markers to make some extra stickers to fill in the circle areas. In the 3rd hour, the students' teacher brings in more stickers to fill in extra areas around the corners of the patterns.

She says, "Why do you think it matters?" Mark says, "Because if the teacher misses a sticker, they will have to draw it to make up the circles."  The teacher says, "OK, Mark, what do you think?  Let’s see your drawing."  Mark says, "That’s different.  I can’t imagine filling in the elephants with only 5 stickers like that."  The teacher says "Do ya think they would need all those stickers?" Mark says, "I don’t know.  I didn’t see any."  They say “That’s right.” The teacher says, “OK, Mark

I went with my parents to this party and the food was so good that it nearly made me forget I was only fourteen.'   How would you express that description?   The party was at a lake just outside the school and everyone was playing football.  Jane brought the 'kids' an ice cream sundae that was so tasty her parents stopped their game for 10 minutes and she ran out of ice cream at the bottom of the lake.  She tried climbing the hill back to their homes and found none of the children in the house - one adult and one teenager, ages 15-17.  Jane was so upset she cried.   She started to feel so sad she decided to hide in the bathroom, but as she tried to hide from the teenager there was no room to hide so she simply threw away a t-shirt she was wearing and stood in the hallway.  After standing in the hallway for some time she decided to come out and told her parents she was still there.  She tried to call for her parents to come get her, but could not because of the teenagers.  They told Jane to call an older boy and ask him to come get her, and before Jane called her parents she ran out of the bathroom door without realizing.  After running down the hill to the lake she found the boys playing football and one of the boys had climbed down the hill with her.  When she found them they gave her some ice cream and gave her a water bottle.  The boys took Jane across the lake and gave her a ride back to her house.  They stopped for drinks at the local pub and took her on a ride on the carousel. After Jane got off the carousel she discovered her shoes were gone, and she didn't know where her other shoes were. She started to look around the house but her family was in another part of the house and she was too embarrassed for anyone to just step foot inside the house.  Jane heard a noise, and looked through the window and saw the kids from the party jumping in one of the lakes and the boy from the pub coming into the house.  Jane told the boys, 'I just found my shoes', and after their laughter faded her parents' laughter took over as they told her they were not happy they couldn't help her.  Jane was crying so hard she started a new tearful crying, and this time with

I boil until the vinegar is dissolved.  The salt and salt salt make the pasta.  The eggs turn out perfectly every time.  The first 2 tries, I put the salt mixture on the pan right after cooking the pasta and add the eggs, but now I use the salt mixture as I stir it.  When the pasta begins to get watery add the eggs next.  There is no need to put salt on the top of the eggs.  The amount of salt is not critical to the taste and it's very hard to over add salt.  I have a friend who doesn’t like the texture and she uses salt to make the mixture.  If you add too much salt, you can still use the pasta if it’s still fresh but it's not the same.

Soon after school John's parents purchased a white and red Chevrolet Malibu.  John's parents had a car accident and John was sent to his aunt's house while his parents recovered.   John's mother's brother works at a gas station on the corner next to John's aunt's house and John's mother takes John's money and he buys a car from him for $4,000.   In the car, the driver's side door window is not closed properly.  John complains to his mother about the car and her brother tells John that is the fault of the gas station owner.  John's mother says she's told the gas station owner before and she's already paid him several times and it hasn't happened.  They make arrangements with the gas station owner that John will keep the windows closed.   John takes his Malibu with him to school.  At the next assembly he tells his classmates that if only he had been driving a red Nova, he wouldn't have had a car accident.  At the football game, after being hit in the arm by the ball one time, John makes a tackle on a quarterback but he gets sacked and goes out of the game.  He makes another tackle later in the game when John's mother comes running out of the locker room.  He takes John's money and tells him that he wants to buy the car back from the gas station owner. John gets mad and confronts his mother about why her brother was so bad to him.  His mother explains to him that her brother was a jerk to her and a jerk to his brother and his mother was their only family.   He buys back the car that he was too scared to drive in order to repay his aunt for the car.  He ends up on the field next to his teammate and tells his mother that his cousin's car broke down and was in the shop and that he was looking for a tow truck.  His cousin's car is fixed in the next few hours and they drive back to the school.  John is happy to drive his Chevy Malibu again.<n>Output: 45<n><n>Input: Mary was given 1

Mary will have her old journal on Thursday of each week.  She will receive her new journal on Friday and keep her old journal on Saturday of each week.  Mary will have 3-4 pages of printed material for her Journal.  The pages she's used so far include: 4 pages of photographs, 4 pages of stickers and 1 page of the Book.

Mary only lost 1 of her remaining stickers on Friday when she finished up preparing her new journals for the week.

He said he was interested in her journals and wanted to ask questions about the things she wrote.  He then asked permission to visit her.  Mary knew that it was a risky situation since Zach was stalkerlike, but she said that she would welcome Zach.  Zach asked her permission to visit her desk at any time and she gave him permission.  She felt good because Zach was nice enough to wait outside the library and that he was respectful.  As Mary waited for Zach, she began to read some of her journal entries.<n> 2.  At about 2:00 Zach came in.  Zach asked Mary's permission to talk.  They talked for 1:30 minutes about a lot of things.  Zach said he had been reading her journal since Friday morning.

At about 4:30 Zach returned and asked Mary if he could use the restroom.

Mark makes $800 in 4 weeks, and so has an additional $700 in his savings account. One week later Mark receives two checks, and deposits $600 into his savings account this time. He does $400 in his savings account, then decides he needs to save an additional $400. He has $700 in savings, and that gives him an extra $500 in his savings account. After this he still has $500 in savings. All of his money goes in his bank savings account. Mark goes to the bank, gives the teller his savings account, and she gives him the remaining $300 to take home.

He did however get $5000 for giving his ticket to a friend.  He received a call during a football game.  When his friend asked him for his ticket he thought he might have won the lottery.  He couldn't believe it.  He was ecstatic until he realized he still had to give his friend his ticket.  He didn't like the idea of wasting money on a ticket like that.  Paul called the ticket office and spoke to someone who was very nice.  He agreed to give Paul his friend's $5000.  The man at the phone asked Paul a few questions as to how he was feeling.  The man then told Paul that he was a very generous man.  Paul was overjoyed because his hard work had paid off.  The man then handed them a check for $50,000.00.  He informed Paul that he appreciated him giving his ticket to a poor person like that.  He gave them a piece of his mind.  Paul later told him that he was giving his ticket to charity, but the man still told him that it was a nice gesture.  Paul told him that if he gave Paul half of his money and let it go, he would have a rich friend.  Paul went into his truck and returned to his trailer.  He opened the door and started to drive off to his trailer.  After looking around he realized that he had no money in his truck.  He started to feel very upset because he could have saved up a lot of money by now if he wouldn't have wasted his ticket on a lottery ticket.  Paul called the phone number on the check and called to ask for help.  The man on the other end of the line asked what he was doing.  Paul told him about his ticket.  Paul explained that it's not a ticket anymore and that he gave it to some friends and it's going to charity.  The man told him that he should've given Paul the money.  Paul felt discouraged.  He didn't want to tell the man what he did.  So he stayed quiet.  He was going to try and get money for it today.  He was hoping to borrow money in order to try and get his "friend" some of the money.  He called the following number.  The number was working.  Paul

That extra $10 he will get as a bonus after he mows the yard would be $35.  The savings account that Zach's parents will pay him has a return of 2.5 percent.  The bank account of A's parents would bring them back $25.  The bank account that A's friend would get from Mark (assuming he has the same amount of interest) would bring him back $95.  The bank account is most efficient if you are guaranteed to get a return.  If Zach were guaranteed a return and then Mark was guaranteed a return too, the efficiency of the program would depend on the number of clients Zach would have.<n>Output: $5.00<n><n>If A makes a one-dollar bet with B at the end of the game, then B loses by paying $10, then A would make a one-dollar bet again with A at the end of the same game.  B loses the same bet every time, and A keeps making one-dollar bets until he eventually loses.  A then makes a one-dollar prediction that B will lose again at the end of the next game and so continues to make one-dollar bets with A at the end.  After 3 games the two of them keep making one-dollar bets hoping to win a million dollars each.

Mark is the student captain of the basketball team  at school, but has his friends tease him.  He wants to let them know it is the opposite of what is happening in the locker room, but instead he makes his friend Zach a scapegoat.  If Mark could convince his friends to support Zach with their actions rather than just being passive-aggressive and keeping it quiet, he knows he can make Zach stand out in the stands and he can get the attention he feels is missing.  He needs their support badly and he feels Zach will be the star player on the team.  What strategies would he use to increase Zach's popularity?<n>Output: Zach and Mark are twins and Zach is the less popular one at school. The basketball team leader, Kevin, was very mean to Zach and he felt he could be a scapegoat and get attention  from all the other boys on the team  because no one will ask him to do the team practices for free because it is a very popular sport in his school.  Zach has never played basketball before and it is hard for him to get noticed.  When he is not going to the team practices and basketball games with Kevin, he would talk to Zach about how he feels good to talk to him, but it felt like people were more interested in beating Matt than in talking to their friend.  He thought the whole situation was unfair, but he could not get any ideas of helping Zach out of his mind until he got home.  He was worried about what was going to  happen to Zach in the school locker room when the other guys found out and would tell him stories to make him feel like the bad friend. He decided to let some of the guys know that if he was going to start making them out like the bad ones, he would know how to stop him.  He let them know that they could talk to him at any time during the day if they wanted to talk about anything.  He told them that there were plenty of people to go around, if they needed help, and that he had other friends that would be happy for them to hang out with them.  He told them he was  thinking about putting up a poster on the basketball scoreboard saying how fun it is to hang out with each other and be good friends.  He wanted to make the people in the locker room more aware and get everyone talking instead of keeping

What are all the requirements?<n>3) What do we know about Zach if he is the only person in his life who doesn't drink alcohol?  What does that say about him?  What does that make the parents?  How does his alcoholism affect others?<n><n>**Discussion**<n><n>It seems to me that it is better to be a drunk guy who owns all the things that you want with no debt than a sober guy who owns only the things you want but no money.  You can still do a lot with your hands and without money.  A drunk guy who will spend a good chunk of time cleaning up the messes he makes can be pretty damn useful when he decides to start working.  The same is true for someone who doesn't really drink.  He can still use his brain and his eyes to keep things neat.  A guy like Zach can use his hands and his eyes quite effectively when it comes to looking nice.  While it would be a lot easier if you could just pick up the things that you wanted with no money, we can't do that and we know that Zach will have to work for the money he will have to use to buy things that he will like with no money.<n><n>Why is it better for Zach to use his hands and eyes than his head and his legs?  Could it be because Zach is more comfortable using his hands and his eyes?  Could it also be because Zach has more time to choose what he wants and what he needs?  Zach has more time to spend on the things that he enjoys or would enjoy spending money on?  This is all speculation at the moment because we don't know how Zach uses his imagination.  If Zach was only given an allowance once maybe he is more likely to spend his money on things that have nothing to do with beer.  The most important is to decide for yourself what are the things that you want but Zach can't afford if you only give him a small allowance because it would take his mind away from other things that he might be interested in or have fun with.  When you get back to work on Sunday and Zach is already cleaning up the messes that came from your drunken session, maybe

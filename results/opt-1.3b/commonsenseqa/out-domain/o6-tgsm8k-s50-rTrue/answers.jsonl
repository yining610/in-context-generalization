One team has 2 cars that drive opposite each other. These cars can go forward for as far as they want without stopping. The other 8 cars must stay where they are until they can go forward for as long as their clock shows. Give them the following information. Their goal is to get to the stop line in the middle of the track. 1: how much longer will they drive until they get there? 2: how many meters will it take them? 3: how many seconds per meter will it take them to get there? 4: how long until the end of the race? If the clock says they have 3 1/2 minutes left, then calculate the length of the roadblock. 5: what speed will the cars have to try to get ahead of each other.\nOutput: Let us assume the cars are moving only 1 meter per second for 3 1/2 minutes. They have an average speed of 9 m/s = 60 m/s/3 1/2 minutes = 13m/s\nSo they will drive 13 m/s/3 = 19m/s/2 1/2 hrs before they finish the race. They are 10 seconds behind the time posted on the timer so they don\u2019t think they have enough time. Since their cars drive slower than everyone else\u2019s, they are not getting close to the time posted on the clock. This means the race ends shortly after the scheduled start: 8 minutes, 19 seconds. They are 2 seconds behind the time posted and will drive about 10 seconds faster than everyone else to get there within the time allotted.\nSo the real problem is not that they got caught behind. The real problem is that they were too slow to make up for any loss of time so there", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

At some point, she will cook the rest of the onions and then use them as her last ingredient during her stir fry. She wants to know how much money she will lose in the process.    How big of a loss will she see in the stock pot without using onions?  Output: The cook will make 30 pounds of stir fry, therefore she will lose $20 and $50 respectively. Her loss is more significant because she has decided to substitute garlic with onions in two different recipes.\nInput: The cooks stock pot is 30 pounds, therefore her stock will be 10 pounds per pot.  She plans to put the 10 pounds stock in the second pot, then the 10 pounds meat into a different pot, then add a can of vegetables into the second pot.  At some point she will remove the vegetables and start the stock pot to make stir fry. She wants $20 from the first pot, but the first pot will lose $100.  Her losses are larger than expected so even though the first pot will reduce her loss, her loss is still significant because she has to add more than the amount of gas she added.\nOutput: The cook will make 60 pounds of stir fry, so she will lose $50 and $20. Her loss is still more significant than expected, so her loss is almost equal to the price she paid for the stock pot.\nSince the cook adds 30 pounds into the second pot during the second pot's cooking, the cook will make 60 pounds+30 = 60 pounds of stir fry. Therefore the cook loses $100.\nSo the final amount of money lost is $100/60 = $<<$100/60=1450>>1450.\nSo the final loss is 1450.\n\nInput:There are 18 students enrolled in a 3 day computer class at the school.

The wedding day is a weekend, and the carpenter will bring his wife to the wedding from the airport in the morning. How many days do you think the carpenter will be able to get free of work?\nOutput: He will be able to spend a week at the wedding, so 7 days, leaving him 12 days total to get work. The average workday is about 1 hour a day, which means the wedding will last 1.5 days. So this gives him a maximum of 3.5 days free work.\nThe wedding day will be 1.5 days, leaving him 20 days total free work for the next 3-2 months.\nThe wedding day = 2.5 days, leaving the carpenter about 5 weeks free work.\nSo the carpenter will get about 3.5 months free work. If he makes $10/day, then he can work for at least 1.5 months.\nThe carpenter has only 2 weeks left of work before he gets a 4.5 year vacation, while his wife has 12 weeks free of work, starting with the wedding. Her job doesn\u2019t require the carpenter to finish the car, so his wife can be at the wedding for 2-3 weeks. So now that the wife has 1.5 months free of work, she is able to hire help for the wedding. Now that the carpenter has 10 days free. So there are 4.5 months free work for him to get a home improvement, or start a business. So he can have a garage full of supplies and tools at the wedding.\nThere are 11 months left until the wedding, but because the carpenter has 20 days free of work, he can hire 1 contractor and 1 plumber, which gives him a total of 24 days free of work. This means a total of 5.5 months free work and 4.5 months of vacation. After the wedding, the carpenter can have the tools and supplies he needed for his home improvement, such as saws, drills, power tools, etc. So in total, 2.5 months of vacation and 0.5 months of home improvement left before the carpenter is fully back.\nThe wedding = 10 days, leaving the carpenters wife about 10 days free work.", "answer": "C: city"}

The dad left forever alone with the card and the card still stays in the kids hand. The card is still there, in the kids hand. It will stay there and so will the father. So the final answer of dad was to not forget 2 years and to continue hiding it. You can still play the card by asking the kid about it but with him or her forgetting about it after 2 years. The father will be alone and the card will stay there. It will be there forever, as long as the father keeps bringing back the same card from the beginning of hiding it.", "answer": "D: cant do"}

He has two hens, and he has four chicks that he could sell. After a week, which of the above three situations would have occurred?\nOutput: After one week, the first two chicks would have hatched. The chickens would be old enough to eat, but they would not have enough strength or eggs, and would need to be fed by the farmer. In the last week, only the third chick would have hatched. It was no longer possible to feed the four chicks. So the remaining three chicks died or got too weak to walk on their own. The farmer decided to save them anyway, so he set out some feed for them that had not been touched in the last week. He decided that he only wanted the chicks that would grow to 2 weeks old, so he had 4 chicks that were 2 weeks old. The farmer got 50 cents for the chickens, and then he sold the chickens to a market. His total earnings on those two sales were $20. At the market, he got 30 cents for each chicken. This amounts to 20 cents per hour that the farmer spent with the hens. So that is what happens to all the chickens that did not make it to 2 weeks (8 chickens). The farmer\u2019s return on investment was $20/2 $40/4 = $50/150\nSo, this is all the information needed to calculate the total earnings.\n\nInput:  There are about 400 people gathered in the library library, and they need some paper.

{"text": "When he was worried that his friend might think he was going to another place, the friend still told him in the end and walked half a lap with him.\nSo the final option is to be confident about who is your friend and who is your friend's friend.\n\nInput:He waits for his friend to get ready before he leaves, but he is worried his friend thinks he meant the other end of the private what? Choices: A: country club B : rich person's house C : park D : court E : gym\nOutput: When he is worried that his friend might be leaving and will stop and take him home, his new friend still tells him \"hey man - no worries. it has been a long day and it is cool to talk later.\"\nSo he was still confident that his friend was a friend of his even when his friend didn't remember that he meant the other end.\nSo now we can answer the question:\nWhat is a friend to a person who has lost his or her friend?\n\nComments:\n\nIt is easy to think of \"friendship\" as two people getting together and talking and helping each other, etc. But friendship is also a special kind of relationship, and this one is not always with people you work, learn with, like, like or get along with. It may take many different shapes and sizes to form.\nIn terms of what the person asks for, I think the more important decision is whether the friendship is more like a good friend or an important friend.\n\nIn \"The Art Of Friendship,\" I talked about a friend (not from your own \"circle of friends\") who said, \"If you want to have a great friend, go to the people you don't like. If they don't like you, they will think you're not worth having.\" That might be the kind of friendship I'm thinking about. When you make it clear you don't like everyone who has ever been a part of it, it makes it possible for people to keep getting to be around you. I think it's a healthy way to manage friendships and to help decide whom to make a good friend.\n\nAs for the second part of the problem, how to have a special kind of friend, that gets the point of the question. I have two suggestions. The first one is:\nIf you're looking for a special type of friend without getting too invested in that friend, that's your first choice.

Susan thought it must be a good employee because he couldn\u2019t fire her. How much did the assistant earn per month? Output:\nSuppose the assistant's name is Joe\nSo suppose Joe gets $1000 =<<1000+10 =<<10000>>>1000\nSuppose we multiply the $1,000 by 9 = $5000\nSo the assistant would normally see his salary as: $2000 x 9 = $5000\nBut since Joe's salary is $1000 the total monthly earnings is: $1300 \u00d7 9 = $2000\nSo the assistant must earn $2000 and spend half on his own salary and half on Susan\u2019s salary.\nWe know that 1 + 1 = 4 so $2000 divided by $4000 ($5000*24) = $1050 for Susan. So $1000 is a reasonable share for Susan. For Joe it is a completely unreasonable share. So he earns 1/8th and must spend half his salary and half his half on Susan.\nSo $1000 divided by $4000 = $4.50\nSo $4.50 divided by $4000 = [$$5,$$4]*5 = [$$]$$$5\nSo the assistant must spend $5 from the assistant's funds and $4.50 from his own.\nSo this total is: $6.\nSo the assistant's total annual earnings for 2008 was $6\nSo the total income in 2008 was $2,500\nSo this income was enough for the assistant to get $2,500 from each year's salary\nSo 2008 = 2008 + $$5 = $8,500\nSo 2009 = 2009 + $4,500\nSo 2009 + $4,250 = $8,250\nSo 2010 = 2011 + $$10,000\nSo 2010 + $10,000 = $12,000\nSo 2011 = 2012 =\nSo we know that 2011 = 2012 + $12000 = $17,000\nSo we know the total of the assistant's income: $17,000\nAnd so we know the total of Susan's income: [$$$$1,$$$7]*$17,000.\nBut it's an extremely simple", "answer": "C: battlefield"}

How much should he buy?\nOutput: He must spend $1000.\nHe drives five miles with $1000. He drives five miles and uses up all of his money so he has to spend another $500 on groceries.\nSo the final total is $1000/5 = $<<1000/5=0>>0 $100\nSo the total was $100\n\nInput and Output: How is the money going to be divided? The total costs are:  * $30x4 x 10 * $35x 7 x 10  = $120 x $1450, that is $280, and then subtract the other items because they cost approximately $150 each. The difference leaves $50 for each person.\nOutput: The cars should be valued differently considering that it is less than $280 each. The total cost is:  * $24 x $200 = $210, so a car is worth:\n * $120 x $70 = $180\n* $120 x $75 = $150\n* $120 x $$ = $180\n = $210 * $70 = $240\nSo the total costs must be $210/$$ $120/$$ $75/$$ = $240 = $180  * $70/$$ = $120 * $70/$$, that is $180/$$ = $180/$$, so the total is: $180/$$ = $$ $140/$$ = $140  $80/$$ = $120/$$\nWhich value is more appropriate at $140 or $120? Since the total values are different, then the total should be $140.\nOutput: The car-value will be $84, so the total values are $140/$$ $120/$$$$=$840+ $120/$$ = $840\nSo the total is: $168/$$ $120/> $60 = $120/$$=$180/$$$$=$280\nSo the total is $168/$$ $60/>> $60 = $180\nSo the sum is: $180/$$$$ = $$ $100/$$$$ = $150\nSo the total is $$$150/$180 = $150\nSo how much did Lauryn and Richard pay? $180/$120=$150 = $150\nSo Laury", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}

You used 10 miles of sidewalk to get to your car. What did you do with your 10 miles of sidewalk to walk home?\nSolution: 10x40 = 10, which is equal to 10. Your walk to your car is 10x40 + (2/10) = 11, which is equal to 11. Your total walk is 13, which is equal to 13.8 miles. Therefore your total walk is 13.8 miles/10 = 12.4 miles of the sidewalk used to go home which is 12.4 miles. For the cars you have to calculate the number of miles you had to walk compared to calculate the distance. Thus, your total walking distance for 1.0 miles is 2.0 miles of sidewalks and you must add 11 from your walking distance to get a total distance, which is 3.0 miles/10 = 3.46 miles. For the number of cars you have to add 17 to your mileage to get the total distance. Thus, your walking distance for 1.1 miles is 4.4 miles when you add 17. Therefore, your total walking distance is 4.4 miles/10 = 4.8 miles. For the miles you needed to walk after eating, add 20 to make that total equal to 29 miles and you then solve the distance in miles and add 20 to get a total distance of 50 miles/10 = 50.05 miles. For the number you need to add, add 26 to get your total number and the result is 2, making your total number = 30x10 = 31x40 = 33x50\nSolution: 31x40 = 32x50 = 33x100 = 33x100.\nSolution: 33x50 = 33x200 = 50x20 = 50, which is 50 x 20 + (50/40) = 20\nTherefore your distance is 21 miles", "answer": "D: amusement park"}

{"text": "The knight will be found where it was first found when Lauryn started with the questions earlier\n\nInput:In the year 2000, the president of the United States wanted to have a speech delivered by a speaker to Congress in Washington, DC.  The first item suggested by the President was James A. Garfield.  His name is remembered as a strong supporter of conservative views and was killed in his office in 1881 following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  To prevent another such incident, the President asked that two members of Congress, John P. Sherman and George Bancroft, be chosen to be present to testify before Congress.  The two MPs were chosen based on their support for the President and their strong positions on the issue.  Two other members of Congress agreed to speak on another issue, so their attendance was not needed or required.  A vote was then taken on three speakers from a list consisting of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.  The three speakers were chosen from the list of nominees based on their opinions based in politics, law and business.  The choice of this speaker as the one chosen to introduce the President did not sit well with the rest of Congress, as it was an attempt to circumvent Congress through the use of special favors.  What happened due to this decision is known as the Constitutional Crisis of 1902.  One issue was never addressed and what happened with this issue is still debated. As a result of the crisis of the President having too much power and using too little, the system of checks and balances in the United States underwent a complete overhaul.  This included the creation of an independent presidency, which was instituted in 1789.  The President is no longer directly elected, however, instead the House of Representatives decides who may give the President their opinion and the Vice President decides who may give the president a speech.  The system of checks and balances was continued through the Constitution, which began in 1789.\nInput: The president's speech is named James A. Garfield. To find out why this name selected, choose to work on the problem of finding a name for a President of the United States.\nOutput: Garfield's name was James A.

So his employees each saved $500\nSo the total salary paid after three years was $13,500 x $1100 = $17,500\nSo the total savings for the three years was $18,500 x $1100 + $17,500 = $22,500\nSo the manager only loses one year for each employee over three years\nSo total savings over three years = $22,500 x $1100\nSo the final salary would be $22,500*$1100 = $23,500\nSo the salary for the manager would be $23,500 x $1100 / $17500 = $32,500\nSo the final salary for the manager was $32,500 x $1100 * $17500 = $40,000\nSo the final salary was $40,000 + $17,500 / $17500 = a bonus of $2000\nSo the bonus was $1800 x $2000 = $3000\nSo that is the total difference over three years between the salary of the manager and the salary of the employee\nSo the salary of the employee = $38,500*$2000 + $2000 * $4000 / $3900 = $5500\nSo the total difference over three year is $5500*$3000 x $4000 / $3925 =\nThe total difference over three years was $5500*$", "answer": "B: shocked"}

The number of people who are at the top for the given period is the number of people in the top group, N. The number of people at the top is the median of the range, M. If everyone at the top earns exactly $10,000, how many people are at the top?\nOutput: If for every $10,000 that the earner earns, that earner generates $101,000 per year, then how many people are making more than that?\nSo the final answer isn't $101,000 or more\n\nInput: If you want to get to the bottom of how many years the average employee has been to work, take the last year of everyone's income from the last 100 years, multiply it by 7.5, and then multiply it by the square root of the number of people. The answer is the number of years the average employee has worked at their minimum wage job.\nOutput: The number above 8 is the median for 100 years.\n\nInput: Since it takes 1 hour to drive from the first to the last, how many miles were there in the car before getting home? Let's say, the first 3 miles took 18 minutes at 90 miles per hour. A 2 hour drive will take 40 minutes at 120 miles per hour. How far does the first road run, and then how far to the last road?\nOutput: The road you started in runs along the horizon of the horizon, then splits off to a point where the first road runs for 9 miles where you make a turn. Then it splits off again. Finally it runs 10 miles west so that in the final section, you turn right.\nSo the final road, for every mile you drive on it is just over 1000 miles. One mile of this road takes 30 minutes, that is roughly 40 minutes of driving. Also, your home should be no more than 70 miles from your work, that should be a good distance.\nSo the total distance you drive on this route would then be 40,000 miles = <40,000 - 1.890 = 17,750 miles\n\nInput: If I am counting in my head how many items are present in the bedroom, what is the total time it takes me to count them?\nOutput: Let\u2019", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

{"text": "There are several places to get a bass clarinet. You could go buy one on Ebay or at an orchestra or music store. Alternatively, you could go to an opera house and hear a concert. Or you could go to an all-request band concert. The piano is a great way to learn the Bass Clarinet if you would like to play the clarinet outside of classical music. Finally, you could go to the home of a neighbor and borrow their music book to learn the bass clarinet. So your best bet would be to go to an orchestra or music store to learn the Bass Clarinet. If you do choose orchestra or music store, there are a number of instrument stores that offer a free audition to see if you are a good musician. The audition includes a practice bass clarinet, if needed. As you can see, there are lots of different options.\nOutput: Let\u2019s look at the numbers here.\nLet\u2019s consider three ways of getting a bass clarinet.\nYour first choice would be Ebay. Ebay has a bass clarinet forum where you can search for a bass clarinet, or even buy one from a friend. All you do is type in \u201cbass clarinet\u201d. You can make a list of the bass clarinets that are currently listed on Ebay. You can also search for an orchestra or music store nearby. If you go to the Opera House in Omaha with your questions and want to learn the bass clarinet, you can always ask the band director if they have any questions about the instrument. You could walk up to the sound board and ask someone there. You could also ask teachers at your music school. They would most likely be happy to help you out and maybe give you a free lesson.\nIf you are looking for an orchestra, you could just go to the school. They would most probably be willing to give you a free lesson and would expect you to show up with a little money ready to pay for a lesson. They would probably also ask you to sign up for a semester of music. You could use the money to buy the music you want and then have a student loan to pay in full.\nIf you are going to be playing a solo, you can go to an orchestra or instrument store. At an instrument store, you could sit down with a sales person and take a look at the instruments. If you like the sound, you could make a purchase while you check out.\nThe next option is", "answer": "C: music store"}

By the end of the second day, he had put $16,000 away. He had deposited $16000*9= >$16,000 in two days.\nIn the second day, Bob lost some money. The same amount of money he put in the first day had been taken. Instead he had put away $6,000, so the total amount of money he put out from his savings each day was less than on the first day.\nSo it is obvious that money games only worked for him on the second day, so that means that money games only worked in two days.\nBob put away less money on the second day than he did on the first day, so all those funds that were taken out on day 3 were lost.\nBut the money games on second day were playing against themselves. They did not play money games to try and make money. All the money that was put into savings was coming out the second day.\nSo money games only worked for Bob once on the second day, and", "answer": "C: injury"}

A non-food bag, because they are mostly filled with non-food items, usually has one or two compartments instead of four or more.  Non-food bags usually have more space than a grocery shopping bag.  While grocery bags often come with two compartments, and two small one-to-one compartments, non-food bags will usually have two to three compartments as well as the one-to-one.  Many grocery items also come in the same bags, so it is very common for a non-food bag to have two compartments and a grocery bag to have one compartment.  Other items that can be packed in grocery bags include shampoo, laundry detergent, toiletries in powder form, etc.\nInput: After visiting the supermarket,  Lauryn purchased food.  Next to the food item was an aisle about cleaning supplies.  There were several racks of cleaning equipment. Lauryn picked up one carton of paper towels and picked up a small stack of scrub brushes.  While she was looking at prices for cleaning equipment, a large carton appeared to fall over on the rack. Lauryn picked it up and found that it was one of those large carts that can hold up to 2 or 3 times its normal capacity.  She bought the large carton and paid for it at the register. A few items in front of Lauryn's cart were larger than her items, and were marked at about twice the regular prices.  She placed her shopping bags on her cart to check prices for her purchase as well.  The bag prices for the bags she already owned were $50, $20, and $15.  After buying some cleaning equipment, she checked her groceries.  The other items she purchased were listed at about half the regular price.

There are 12 people living together who earn a total of $600 each a month. They rent a house that is 500 square feet. They spend an average of $35 on groceries a month and divide the rest between the 12 people. What do you deduct from their $1,500?\nOutput: The group will divide $700 a month into 12 payments of $36, and save the rest. They will earn $200 a month in interest and pay $600 for the first year of the house.\nSo the total amount the 12 people have to pay is $200/12 = <<200/6=150>>150\n$1,500 divided by $150 divided by 4 gives them $150/4 = $150, making $200 a month. They have $200, so $300 per month will be returned to the group.\nSince that is not enough, the group adds $100 to the monthly payment. The total of all of their payments in addition to $200 per month is thus: $600 + $300 = $720 per month. But of course the group also has to pay property taxes, since the house is their home.\nThe group is divided into 4 equal parts. Since each person has a $700 a month allowance, they take out $300 from the $1,500 and place it in their bank account as a credit. This credit then increases their total monthly payment to $720.\nSince they still each have $700 in their bank accounts, the credit can be withdrawn as they wish. They can spend their monthly credit immediately, because if they do not use it during the next 12 months, the credit will be gone. The $720 credit also allows them to use an extra $200 a month to buy clothes and toys, if they want.\nHowever, the group could continue to use the credit for a year. In that case they will have an extra $200 a year (plus the cost of the extra $200), so they must spend the $200 a month instead of saving it. However, if they do not spend it at all, the credit disappears.\nSo the final total comes to $700/12 times $", "answer": "C: city"}

The day before, her husband gave Alice a big tocky to keep. He didn\u2019t tell Alice that the fox would be the last thing Alice gives away with the tocky. When Alice got the fox, she didn't put it anywhere. A day before the toys arrived, some of the kids arrived home. Did Alice wait until the friends came back from the school or should she have told them about the fox?\nOutput:The day before, Alice asked the daughter of one of her students how the toy arrived.  On that day, Alice told the daughter that she got the fox from her tocky, and she would give her a big tocky.\nSince Alice didn't say anything to her students when it came time to give away the toy, when the friends arrived the next day, they didn\u2019t give up their tocky until Alice gave it away.  Thus, on that day, when the kids got back from school, they didn\u2019 t get the tocky. This is why it was the wrong time to get the fox because the friends didn\u2019t know that Alice would wait until they got back from school. This is why it is more correct to say that giving the gift on some future date is wrong.\n\nInput:In this experiment, a person is given a 50-cent check. They have no way to count the amount of money.

They have a total of $5000 in debt and there is no way they will be able to pay it off in one year. They can postpone the payment of $5,000 a month. What can they do?\nOutput: They can either pay $5,000 a year for the debt or forego $5,000. They can keep paying for the debt or just forego paying it. If they keep paying the debt, they may need to buy a house, but they might be able to sell for $500,000 and put that money toward the debt. If they forego $5,500, they won't be able to buy a house, and they won't have the $500,000 to cover the debt. And that money is better off being put toward the debt. So that $500,000 can go to $500,000 of interest instead, which is a lot less than $5000. (They would also be able to pay off the house later)\nAssuming that John and Jane forego paying $5,500 over 6 months, then they can still pay off the $5000 over a year. Therefore the monthly amount of debt paid is $2500 and not $5,000. So the total amount of money taken out of the economy is $7500, not $5,000 or $5000.\n\nInput: If you are going to be on a mission for a month, what 3 things should you take with you on your mission?\nOutput:  If you are going to a missionary mission, take some toiletries, clothing, a Bible, a pen, a paper or two a map (if you will be using one), and some books.\nLet's say you are going to the Philippines to teach the Spanish language.

How much is the home worth when the mortgage is paid off?\nOutput: The couple estimate $150,000 minus their mortgage.\nThe house is worth $125,000 once the mortgage is paid off.\nSo the final mortgage balance is $50,000 for the couple's house.\nSo the final question is $50,000 plus $50,000 = $100,000\nSo the final answer: $100,000\nIt would be between $100,000 and $100,000 = $100\nSo the final answer was $100,000\n\nInput: The CEO of the company needed 2 employees to work full time.

How much of his business's income is lost with the employee's salary?\nOutput: The CEO loses $10 million dollars with the employees salary. His total money is $200,000+200,000+20,000 =$>>>200+20,000=$>>>$>>>$>>>$=20,000\nSince the total value is now $175,000, the CEO loses $175,000\nSo the answer is $175,000\nIt would take 20 years for the total value to add up to $1,000,000\nSo the total financial loss is $175,000.\nSo the final total is $175,000 plus $175,000 = $1,000\nSo the original response was $1,000, and the final answer is $1,000.\nSo I guess I got $1,000 correct.\nSo the final response is $1,000\n\nInput (a): An investor with $600,000 has a business loan, along with a business owner\u2019s loan.

If the employee spent $10,000 on new rings, what percent of that money would be donated?\nOutput: 90% - 10 = 3 = 3/3rds = $3,000 remaining.\nSince 90/3rds = 3 == 10/4ths = 2, they decide to split their profit between $3,000 and $3/4ths for the families of the 9/11 victims. But they won't split the profit for the victims who were killed during the attack because they don't want to be seen in a show of support, whereas the victim's families wanted it. The two friends decide not to split the profit and donate the total to the families of the 911 victims. So their donation ends up being $3/4th of $10,000. Therefore, their donation ended up being 30/100 = 60%. They decided to donate $60/100. They then decided to donate 30/100 of $50,000. So their total donation ended up being $30/100 - $25,000 = $25,000. So the final answer is $25,000.

Each person must choose a person to be their surprise and have them pay. What is the most obvious way that one can pay? Do people have any other ideas they would like to share?\nOutput: When choosing a person to be their secret Santa, the trick is to make them spend their money wisely by offering them gifts in exchange for what they spend.  Here is an example: Jane buys some gifts for everyone in her office for the holidays.   If Jane buys her boss another $50 gift, what does Jane have to do to get him a gift?\nOutput: Jane should buy her boss a lunch, a drink, and a card.  Then she should propose they spend more money and buy something special.\nJane is supposed to offer each person a gift, and then she should say \u201cOk my surprise is here, this is what you owe me. Now let's spend our money wisely and take advantage of what we buy.\u201d\nJane should take control over her own gift exchange by choosing the person she is going to surprise first before everyone is chosen.\nJane should take control of her gift exchange by buying what will make each person feel most accomplished.\nJane should take charge of her gift exchange by purchasing what makes each person feel valued.\nJane should take action by taking control of the gift she was choosing to be their secret Santa.\nSo the final lesson is take control over your gift exchange and treat it like an opportunity to pay forward.\nSo Jane chose her friend John to be her Santa because he's a great boss and he values her time, but when she tells John that she is going to pay for a lunch, a drink and a card, she changes plans and buys him a small gift.  John sees these little gifts and knows that Jane will want to spoil him and that's a great problem to have.  Jane can now pay her friend $300 and still have enough for the gifts for everyone else.\n\nInput: John asked Jane to make him a cake for his birthday because she has a gift certificate.

If you estimate that there will be 5 school years per year and that a student will spend 9.64 months at school, how many hours are required in a school year?\nOutput: If the hours needed to complete all tasks in a school year are, $400 per year = $1600, then there are 48 hours in a school year. If we divide $1600 times 5, we divide that by 10, that is 10^8 *48 = 40, so we get 20 hours, the maximum time one can spend in school.\nIn total there will be 20 + 40 = 100 hours, which is the maximum amount of time one can spend in a school year.\nSo the final question is 100\n\nInput: You were in your car driving to work.

George also took a picture of his shirt before handing it over to his friend. \u201cMy new shirt really gets on my nerves,\" George said. What can George do about it?\nOutput: George has to pay one of his friends to help him count the shirts in his room, so George throws the new shirt into his trash can in his room. Because he has no idea how many shirts are in his new shirt anymore, George calls his friend so they can count the shirts together. George throws his old shirt into his trash can and tells his friends he has 12 shirts left. George also pays his friend to count the shirts in his trash can. By the end of the day, George still has 12 shirts left because his friend hasn't counted his trash can yet. George told his friend that he would give up his favorite t-shirt if she counted his trash can. What will George do if his friend counts the trash can?\nOutput: George will give up a shirt he loves that has 18 items that he feels he will treasure next to give something he loves less than a shirt that has just 9 items?\n\ninput:The first letter of each alphabet is different in each language.

She was very disappointed, because she needed $400 to buy gifts for her family.  She was given $100 to spend and saved $70 for the rest.  If she spent every dollar she saved, she would be completely broke at the end of her summer. How much did she end up spending on gifts for her family?\nOutput: Alice worked very hard for 4 months, putting money aside until she reached the point that she could buy $400 for her family.  In total, she spent $400 on gifts for her family. That was $100 left over, so Alice used those $70 dollars on other expenses and saved $20.\nTherefore, the total amount of money that Alice spent on gifts was $100, so her total savings was $80. The total left over was $20. Alice earned $200 with the money she spent on gifts, which would be $80 + $20 = $160. A total of $160 + $20 = $240.\nThis left over money could have been used to help Alice pay for school.  That is, if Alice used all the $40 she had left over at the end of her school year, she would have gone to school with much less debt than if she had just paid for school with the money she saved.  She had earned $360.\nTherefore, the final answer was $240.\nSo the final right answer is $240\n\nInput: A car goes on sale at a price of $1200.  It is advertised on Craiglist for $1000.

He can eat one bread, a piece of cheese and a piece of sauce at each option while being served all of the different options. Therefore, he ate 2 breads + 1 sauce per option and 1 bread without sauce. Therefore, he ate 1 bread + 1 sauce. Therefore, he could eat 3 breads, one sauce, one bread + sauce, 3 breads, one Sauce, and 3 breads + sauces total while being served all the different options. Therefore he did not eat 3 breads + sauce = 1 bread, only two breads. Therefore, he did not eat 2 breads + sauce = 2 breads\nTherefore, Lauryn would not eat 2 breads and a piece of cheese = 2 breads = 2 breads. Therefore, she did not eat 3 bread + sauce = 3 breads. Therefore, Lauryn did not eat 3 bread = 3 breads.\nTherefore, John gave himself no bread so that he could have the first option.\nTherefore he ate 1 bread + sauce = 1 bread = 1 bread. Therefore, he ate 3 breads + 1 sauce = 3 breads = 3 breads, and he ate 3 breads = 1 bread, no cheese. Therefore, he could not eat 2 breads. Therefore John ate 3 breads + sauce and was served only 1 bread in two options.", "answer": "A: bathroom"}

However, they now have a new car that gets 12 mpg. Since the old car gets 20 mpg and the new one gets 12.5 mpg, which one is more energy efficient?\nOutput:Since the old car gets less than the new one in mpg, then the old car is more energy efficient and is only worth $100. However, since the old car also gets less than the new car in money, it is worth $50.\nBut the new car gets 12.5 mngelts and gets $150. Therefore the new car is worth $200 and is worth $150. Therefore, since the old car gets more total mpg on average than the new car, the old car is worth less and is also worth $50. It is energy efficient to buy the old car. Therefore the new car was also more efficient and was worth $200. The new car cost $200 so the two cars are both energy efficient but the new car is a better buy. Therefore $100 was the better choice the new car. $150 was worth just as much.\nHowever, since the old car only had 1 mpg, because it only had the same amount of fuel and did not have more energy, the old car is only half as efficient as the new car and was worth $80. Therefore, the old car is half as efficient and was worth $40. The new car is half as efficient so it was half as efficient as the old car and was worth only $30. Therefore, the old and new cars were both half as efficient as the other and wasted half of their money. Therefore $80 was the better choice the old car. $130 is the better choice the new couch because the old car only had 2 mpg and the new couch has 4, which is twice as much. $200 is half as efficient as twice as efficient as $130 because the old car only has twice the mpg and the new car has four times as much.

If John sells the car, what are the possibilities that he could get?\nOutput: If John sells the car and gets another $1000 out of it, he bought an extra $1000 car. His total is then $1050. If the dealer takes $150 out of the total and gives the rest to John, he made $100 off the $1000 car. He now has $150 to buy the new car. If the dealer keeps the money, he makes $150 off the total.

So he first eats the 10 eggs in his basket. And then he eats the two eggs in one basket. And then he must eat at least one egg every time.\nAssuming that Jim eats at least 3 eggs every day, it\u2019s time for lunch. Therefore he eats 3 eggs out of the 10 that he has.  Therefore there are 4/4 eggs, so Jim eats 4/4 eggs and thus the total number of eggs he eats = 3/4 * 10 = 20 eggs\nSo the final answer in this game is 20\n\nInput: If a person sits at a table 3 times, how many times must the person sit at the table before he can buy an egg?\nOutput: 4\nSince the first 2 times the person sits at the table, he doesn\u2019t need to buy an egg then, because 4 is the same as 2, but 4 is also the number of eggs he ate the first time he sat at the table. So after sitting at the table 4 times, he can get 2 of the 3 types of eggs.\nSince the last 2 times he sat at the table, he has eaten 3/4 of the 3 types of bread, so he can only eat 1 egg out of the 10 eggs he has. So he has 9/10 eggs but he is close to buying only one egg (9/10 * 1) so he does not need to eat anymore.\nSince he can only eat 1/2 of the 10 eggs, he needs to make the last 2 times he sits at the table count for 3/4. So he must sit at the table 3 times before he can get some eggs. So with three times, there are 9/10 eggs, so he won\u2019t have enough time to wait. So then with two times, he only has to sit at the table 2 times (because of the 4 * 2 / 2 = 48 eggs) to get some eggs. Then with the 1 time he sits at the table, only 1 egg is needed, so he only has to sit on the table 1 time. After sitting", "answer": "A: feel sorry"}

If he turns the screw knob 3 times, then he has to turn it for the knob 3 times. If he turns the button knob 3 times, then it has to be on the 3rd time for the knob to stop playing. After the switch knob 3 times, it will still play music if you turn the TV off. The knob will keep changing so many times because it needs to. If the knob is turned off in between the last 3 changes, the display won't be affected. If you keep turning the knob, the knob will keep playing the music. After 6 days, it will stop. If the knob stops playing music after 6 days, the lock button of the TV will work. After 6 days, he can't lock his cable box.\nOutput: After only 6 days, the picture never changes even after turning the knob 3 times\n\nInput: If Charlie's favorite sport is hockey then his family will not be able to provide the extra payments needed for the lease on a new apartment complex in a nearby city.

{"text": "What comes first for a student? Is it the ability to learn?  If so, then you are limited in a limited way, which explains the fact that you have to do it well.  If you can't control the environment that you are in, then that is even worse.  Your education is limited to those things that can be controlled such as grades, tests, etc. When the environment and the teacher fail you, you get frustrated with those teachers. This leads to depression. Depression can be fatal, so it is easy to see why someone doesn\u2019t want to be around those people.\nIf you think it is better for a student to be around those people, then you are likely a person of privilege. Privilege means that you got your life easier than you would because these people were born in a certain country. You are likely more intelligent, have a better education and are more likely to lead a successful life. Those with privilege can be more successful than those without privilege as you are more successful and more intelligent because of the advantages (and disadvantages) in being born in a certain country, you have advantages that are taken from anyone else. But most people with privilege have not been deprived of anything, like not having their parents take care of them, not being able to leave their country without getting in a lot of trouble, or not being able to go to university. You probably have advantages when you have been educated to go into certain jobs, not everyone has that. So yes, you got the life easier because of your privilege, but only because you weren't deprived of anything.\nSo the final answers is intelligent\nAnd education.

Amy is able to play while he has kids because she lives on her own in a house with just two bedrooms.\nIf John has the ability to make time for play as a rule, Amy does not.\nBecause John and Amy do not have any children to play with\n(since their kids are too young for play), they cannot have children of their own.\nSo they cannot afford a home with 5 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms.

If they are able to finance the horse at cost, what is the amount they need to finance?\nOutput: 0.3 = <<0.3*100=0.3>>100 = <<0.3/100=0.3>100\nBut if they pay full cash, the couple would be responsible for the full amount of the horse. So the couple needs to divide 0.3 by 100 to get 0.3*100 = 0.3**1/100 = 0.2**100\nSo the total amount of money they need to finance is 0.2**100 = 0.2*0.3 = 0.2\nWhich means, the couple doesn't have enough to finance the horse at full cost, and they should find out what their loan rate is. So 0.2*0=0.7\nSo the total amount financed is 0.7 - 0.2*0 = 0.7\nSo the final answer for both of these examples is 0.2\n\nInput:A dog\u2019s tail has two heads, what is the animal\u2019s tail\u2019s real name?\nOutput:The dog's tail has two heads, so the animal's tail's name is T.\nThe dog has two tails\nSo the total amount the animal had in his life was zero\nTherefore the total amount of the animal\u2019s life was 5\n0 = 5/100 = 5/5 = 5\nIn this", "answer": "C: with people"}

Gerhard bought 20 of the ice cream packages, so the entire police force delivered 40 packages, each to the mayor. Which three packages were sold the most?\nOutput: Three ice cream packages = $40.00. Gerhard bought the three ice cream packages himself.\nSo the two sales of the ice cream were $40 per night = $<<40-40x40=120>>120\nThe total amount of money Gerhard made was $120 x 35 = $240\nAnd the total amount of money Lauryn made was $160, while her friend Aurelia was only able to sell five ice cream packages as well. So the total net profit of both Lauryn and Aurelia was $240 (since $50 is what the mayor was paying to Gerhard for the ice cream packages).\nSo the total amount of money made is $240 minus $160 = <<240/160=60>>60\nSo the final answer must be 60\n\nInput: We need to make 12 baskets.

One of the men who brought the cattle bought 15 pounds of salt from the boy. He divided the salt evenly among all the people so each person would have a little salt. He gave 10 of the pounds to the three men who were leading the herd to the market to get food, and he gave 5 pounds of salt back to the man who bought the cattle. He gave the remaining 5 pounds to the boy.\nAs soon as the trader got home, he took the boy with him and sold him to his own family who raised the boy to be a rich man (i.e. slave) in another part of the country.\nThis story is interesting because the boys' family never told the mother what he had done, and the boy knew about it.

Last week his editor received a manuscript from Barry Soto that\u2019s nearly 500 pages. How many pages is Barry\u2019s manuscript?\nOutput: 1085.3 pages.\nThe publisher estimates that the length of every new book will increase over the coming years from 740 to 1,100 pages. Based on that, they estimate that the length of the current books will increase in the coming years as well. Based on our reading of the last five years, the publisher expects the average length of both books will increase from 780 to 1,150 pages by the end of the decade \u2014 an increase of 5%. Based on our reading of our personal reading habits, we expect that the average length of books we read in the next ten years will increase from about 800 pages to 1,650 pages. If Barry\u2019s manuscript was printed at 565 pages per book, then the publisher estimates that the size of the book will increase from 895 to 1,130 pages by the end of each decade.\nSo the total number of pages in his manuscript would be 1,130 + 895 = 1,210 pages, which would be the current total of his novels (both current and future). Based on our reading habits, we expect the number of future books produced by Barry Soto will increase by about 15% from 800 to 1,450 pages, which would place the average length of future books at 1,550 pages, which would more than double from the current 800 pages.\nSo the final total of pages in his manuscript is 1,410 plus 800 + 45 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 1,615 pages\n\nInput: There is a school in the city where the children are very bad actors.

So the student does not need the gift but he does need the money from the teacher because of gifts. His gift is not worth the money (the value of the gift), so she has to give him the money. So the student ends up giving the teacher the money to buy something else, because she originally gave him a gift and she was wrong about it. So the teacher does not need the money from him so she makes him give her the money first, then he has to give her the gift. So the student ends the trip with the gift, so it is an extra gift.\nOutput: It makes sense because he did not need the gift and she did not need the money.\nThe student then gave her gift to his friends that came with him. Therefore the gift he gave to them is worth less than the money she sent him because of the gifts.

Suppose one person in the group feels as though he would prefer to marry anyone of the other 9, the remaining 9 would like to marry someone of the same gender.  How many pairs of legs/foreheads does the guy have in that group?\nOutput: All 10 people have 2 pairs of legs and a single head because of the male/female ratio of 1:9.\nIf only 1 person in the group feels that way, only one person in the group would not marry that gender (the guy). He would marry his closest male friends\u2019 legs.\nThus 1:9 is the average and only 1 member of the group would marry their friends\u2019 hands.\nThus, the average and only member of group would have no legs/foreheads.\nBut if the group consisted of 6 boys with 4 girls, then all 6 of the boys will have 3 legs/foreheads which, given the gender in group, would be the average for all boys in the group.\nSo the average for the male members of the group will be 3/6 = $<<3/6=7>>7 legs\nSo the final answer would be 7\n\nInput: Alice says that she loves her cat, and that he loves her.

If it is stolen, how fast will it be?  It would have to be stolen if Lauryn has less than $1.5 in the car. So how far will the car go? (i.e. how far will it travel)  In the worst case scenario, the thief may still get $1.5 from the car. So a thief could be forced to drive to work and back at the car only. How far can the car go in this scenario? (i.e.: 10 km/h = 10 km/h) >>5 = 5 km\nOutput: Lauryn's house has a top speed of 20 km/h. The car should be able to cover 5 km in 10 minutes even if stolen. So it'll take 10 minutes from Lauryn's place to the thief's workplace.\nSo the thief will have to drive at least 15 km every time he or she is driving the car. (i.e.: 5 km = 5 km/h) >>15 = 15 km/h\nSo the thief will be wasting a big chunk of his or her day at work. So if he or she drives 3.5 km in 10 minutes, he will waste the first 45 min of his day. So if the thief has less than $1 then she will have to spend 30 minutes of her day at work. Then she will have to go the car again to make up for it. If he drives 5 km in 10 minutes, then the thief will have wasted at least 45 minutes of his or her day because he or she has to drive more. In the worst case scenario Lauryn needs to drive the car 2.5 km every time back to the house. So her and her car will be going 4 km every time it travels from her house to the thieves workplace. So in all cases, the thief will be wasting 45 minutes of his or herself at work. So his or her car will probably be stolen. Maybe the thief will manage to steal $1.5 from Lauryn, otherwise he or she will have wasted $2.5 today. So the thief", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

His brother Jimmy works as a construction worker in the city of San Jose, California. San Jose has an unemployment rate of 4%. How many people would go out for a job, search for a job, and get a job?\nOutput: The job offer can be split, but the total number of people would not be much, so it makes sense to use total job offers.\nSo John has an offer from 4 people (2 men, 2 women), so he can search for a job for 20 and obtain a job for 4. In total, there are 40 people that can be found seeking a job at the same time and 3 people can be hired as job applicants.\nSo the total number of people who would find and get a job during John's search for a job is 20 x 4 = 80 people, and 3 people obtain job offers for job applicants.\nSo John has 2 interviews and 2 offers, plus he has 2 job offers.

{"text": "what can years of being a proffesional player lead to? Choices C: tennis elbow, proffesional player or exercise D: victory, becoming tired\nIn the game of tennis, there are two different types of tennis.  One type of tennis is called the professional play.  In this type of tennis a player is trained hard until he gets good at hitting the ball. At the same time, he pays a coach a lot of money to practice with him.  The coach gives the player lots of tennis balls and sets him up to get good at hitting the ball in the correct direction.  When the professional player gets good at hitting the racket, he can start playing professional tennis matches.  This is how the proffesional player gets great players to play tennis for him and win more tournaments.  The other type of tennis is what is called the amateur play.  In this case a person does not have a coach and his best shot at winning the game is to hit the ball in the correct position.  When you go to a tournament or a club, you should not expect to get great players to play the game.  The chances are small for all players to beat a proffesional play player.  The chances are even smaller for a member of a club to beat a proffessional player.  On the other hand, you can go to a tennis club and be a team member.  At the professional level, the best players do not play to win or lose as a team.  They just play to win.  The amateurs have to play for a club or tournament.  Since they do not win as a team, they usually play in their own club or tournament.  You can also watch professional play.  If you are interested in tennis, then go to a competition or a tournament.

They have only used $1270 of credit in the past 2 years.  How much do they spend on their family instead of a new vehicle?\nOutput: How much did they spend on groceries over the past 2 years?\nSince they only spend $1270 on groceries per month, that is $9.34 per month.  If they were able to spend only $9.34 per meal, their spending would be $0 for the year 2000.

When they wrote, he wrote $1.\nOutput: Since the previous paper estimated the average monthly income at $1440, he increased the monthly median income by $400 and he increased the annual income by $100.

Output: The father will buy money for the child when he is hungry.\nSo the question is, \u201cWhat happens if the father forgets?\u201d It cannot be a question as the child\u2019s father is already helping. If the child forgets, the father will buy money for him.\nSo we must say that the question can only be answered with \u201cWhat happens if he forgets?\u201d\nThe correct answer is \u201che will be poor and hungry.\u201d He will have to ask to eat later.\nOutput: \u201cThe father will buy money for his child when he is hungry\u201d\nSo the right answer is \u201cMoney is not enough.\u201d It is always necessary to ask for help.\nOutput: \u201d\u201cThe father will buy food later\u201d will still be true. It is still not enough to provide for the son.

The \u201cWhat happens if you forget?\u201d question is the only way the father can help his son (How could the father forget?). So the correct answer to the question is \u201cWhenever the father can.\u201d\nSo if he forgets one day, but not the other day, \u201cWhen does he ask for help?\u201c becomes \u201cWhen is he hungry?\u201d or \u201cWhen is he thirsty?\u201d or \u201dWhen does he need money?\u201c, etc. Now the child is asking for help.

Most people are anxious that they will be late or will be late because they don't like to go to the doctor. Because of this anxiety, they will often call the doctor before they go so that they will be on time. On the other hand, others might be more efficient and choose not to be late. On average, no one is late. However, on rare occasions, individuals are late for work or to the doctor. In such a situation, the patient or the teacher would get annoyed by the person being late. This results into the loss of face for the person being late. Therefore, the time taken to get to the doctor might be longer then usual. However, once the doctor is done helping the patient, the patient may be more relaxed and have more time to think of things. In average, everyone can be late and if you are not, then you will lose face.\nOutput: The following question is very interesting. Every time we are working, we are working with the help of a team. The question here is how different teams will be affected. The answers are\nIf a team makes its time to get to the doctor's office by being early, then the doctor and patient will get a happy attitude and everyone will receive free time to think and not be anxious about getting to work on time.\nIf a team makes their time to get work done so fast, on rare occasions, some people will be late because people might be busy with their team meeting. Or sometimes, people may be late because they were not thinking before or because of laziness.\nIf a team can get on time through planning and patience, then the whole team will go to the doctor's office on time.\nAlpha: Do it all Yourself\nB Alpha: Do the job of others\nC Alpha: Don't do the job of others\nD Alpha: Help the Team\nE Alpha: Go Together\nExplanation: When we are not organized we make the", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

So your overall expected amount is never less than what you get by playing pool hall.\nIf you play the mediterranean sea, the chance of winning is the maximum when using the casino strategy and that strategy is most likely used. The shark has only 1% chance to win. If you choose the pacific ocean, there's almost a 100% chance to win, because the only place it is unlikely to win is Hawaii.\nIf you choose the pool hall, your expected amount is 50 if you pick 1 of the 6 players and 1.5 if you pick 3 players. But since you have more than 0.33% chance to bet on the pool or mediterranean sea, you have more than 50% chance to win without selecting those players.

The shark will always have a chance to win and you never have a chance to win as long as it is in both a place where there's more than 1 player and in a place where it isn't in either place. If you play the pool hall, it's easier because the odds are always equal.

In addition, he spends $45 at the liquor store to buy beer for his customers and has $10 left to save. The man spends $10+45= $<<10+45=51>>51\nOutput: He saves $30 by not buying beer, but spends $45 at the grocery store to buy cigarettes and $150 to make dinner. He has $15 left after paying $75 for delivery, food and drink.\nNow that he saved $15 on delivery, food and alcohol, he takes $75 out of his pocket and buys the cigarettes ($75-80) + gas ($75) = $<<75/80=$45>>45 gas\nHe spends $45 on cigarettes and a couple of drinks, with only $5 being left, so his total cost is: $<<60+45=51>>53\nSo the final answer ($45 + $75) is $<<60+45=$51>>53\n\nInput: A friend\u2019s wife is planning to make a new job for", "answer": "A: cash register"}

They bought several items for $20. They went to a family reunion at a summer camp and bought 20 more items for $20. How many items did they buy overall?\nOutput: 40, because 40 = $20/20 = $40\n40 is the limit because there are 20 in the first place, so 20 plus $20 is 40.\nSo the final total is $160\n\nInput: When the couple was getting married, the young man wanted the bride to wear a dress that was special to her. Which flower should the bride choose to wear? Why?\nOutput: She chose to wear a lace dress. It was special to her because she wore it to her grandma\u2019s wedding, which was held back in the day when wedding dresses weren\u2019t lace.\nThe bride also wore lace to her dad\u2019s wedding, when she didn\u2019t need to wear it because she went with her mom who wore a flowered dress. Since grandma\u2019s wedding is the pre-wedding and she doesn\u2019t need to dress up for dad\u2019s wedding she didn\u2019t think that a different kind of dress seemed like a good idea. The wedding also had a very small guest list. So her dad\u2019s dress was less of a necessity than a dress would have been to her mom.\nSo the bride chose a lace dress to wear to her grandma\u2019 wedding. Which flower should the groom choose for her to wear?\nOutput: He chose a green rose. It was special to him because it had sentimental value.\nSo the final product was a green rose.\n\nInput:The woman took a test and scored 100%.

(Eg, a house is 1000 sq ft and a double bed in it is $1,000),  2.  (1) is true even if $600 is not a typical budget for the family because each person in the family spends $1,000, and in a house of 900 sq ft, the average people spend $700. (i.e: one person pays $500, another $300, etc) 3. (2) is true even if no one has to cook or wash dishes for the month- not only if one person has to cook dishes.\n4. (2) is not really true, in that, with any budget, the person who's the primary breadwinner can't spend $200 or less for 1 person's dinner, let alone $300 or more for a month.\n5. (4) is not really true in the example used, as two people with full-time employment, a kid (5 yr old and under, no matter whether he eats alone or with adult help), and one elderly relative make up the bulk of one family, with no family friend helping out financially.\n6. Finally, (6) is false, as $20/1,000 sq ft is a bit below standard living expenses in the US; even a tiny 3 bdrm house near the outskirts of the city would likely afford everyone $70/week. So the final answer is the median income is $50,000, so the family of four would have a combined income of $70,000/quarter. So the family with a median income of $50,000 would see their family income of $50,00/quarter.\n7. (1) and (3) are wrong, as (1) is true but (3) is false, in that (2) is true, but (3) is true but (4) is false in that the family of four would likely be able to spend less than $35,000/quarter on groceries. (This doesn't apply to higher income families, if they can actually afford to eat better than we can, and so (4) is more realistic.)", "answer": "B: grocery bag"}

This means the owner of the restaurant would have to earn, on average, $200 from the sale of this one egg machine per month. If the restaurant only charges $10 each month for 14 eggs, the owner would earn $200 from this single machine per month, assuming that the restaurant is open for an hour.

A: $150 B: $130 C: $120 D: $95 E: $80\nOutput: The costs for 1 kg of butter are: D $100 +E $90 +C $75 = <<30+20=50>>50kg\nCalculate the total, which includes the price of ingredients. $150 is the price of butter made using fat. If it costs $100 to add salt to the butter, the salt in the butter must be added before the butter is heated, so it is not added to the equation. $130 is the cost of butter made without salt. Since it is $75 to buy fat, if you add salt to the butter after the butter is chilled, then it needs to be heated up once more so you must add it twice to get the correct result. Thus, $80 is the cost of butter that does not use any fat.\nSo total cost of butter is: $150 - $80 = <<20-20=30>>30kg\nThen the price of butter per kg is 30/50 = <<30/50=150>>150kg\nSo the final answer for the question is 150\n\nInput: What are the two words on the word wall that say \"Porridge-Pudding-Paneer\" and \"Porridge-Lentils-Dal\"?

It was time to clean all the socks so he put them in the washer. If he could only put two pairs of socks in the washer at a time, what would the result be?\nOutput: A pair would fit if he was able to get the others out of the pack without getting any socks wet. Otherwise, an empty pair would fit.\nTherefore, two pairs would fit on the first wash.\nA pair would fill up the washer with half of the socks. Therefore, after a second wash, the socks would fill up about half the washer and half the washer\u2019s capacity. When Alfred was done, the rest of the socks would sit on the shelf.\nTherefore, Alfred has only half as much sock room as everyone else. The difference between the numbers of socks he has is 50.\n\nInput:You are in the process of building a two-level playroom. You have four walls ready. Three walls are 1.5 inches thick.

If they slept only 8 hours, they would never wake up again.\nOutput:If they were awake after 8am when they went to bed they would go to bed at 8am instead of 6pm. The 6pm time slot is when they go to bed.\nTo be more specific, they would go to bed after 8am, wake up at 8am, and get up at 6pm.\nTheir time slot of 8am has all the same factors as that of 8pm. The only difference is they have to go to sleep at midnight instead of 6pm. So 8am = 8*6 = 10noon.\nIf they slept 8+10, they would go to sleep at 9am and get up at 10pm. If they slept 9*10, they would go get up at 9am and get 11pm. So 9*10 = 12pm.\nSo 8am + 10 = 8*9 = 9am.\noutput: 8am + 10 = 9*9 = 8am\n Output: 8am + 10 is 9*9 = 8\n Output: 8am+10 = 10*9 = 9\n Output: 8am and 10 are each valid options.\n\nInput:What\u2019s the name of the restaurant near the mall?\nOutput: The restaurant is called D.G.

So to make everyone happy he decided to just act all funny. So it made the funeral not a good family event and made it not be the funeral they were expecting but a more somber one. And people left the funeral less happy then they came in. His father died from Cancer.\nSo the final one is somber with the somberness caused by this situation.\n\nInput: John was supposed to speak at the funeral of his father. He was happy with those plans, then decided to change them. The reason was he wanted to wear a suit and tie the funeral. It would have cost him $150. John decided he had a good reason to do this.  He was going on a business trip. So he made a list of items he wanted to purchase before coming back and purchased many things on his list. When John returned from the trip, he was already worn out. Before the trip, his friend told him to write down all of the things he bought for the trip and return them. So John wrote down everything and returned everything to his friend.\nResult? He could have put his business trip on hold until he could buy a suit and tie and still spend the money he wrote down. So the final answer is No.\n\nInput:  John and Mike were supposed to spend $100 on a pair of shoes for the funeral. However because they had a meeting, they did not pay the entire amount. If they had met at the grocery store, they would have paid half the amount, and would have still ended up spending $200 on the shoes.  If John and Mike had had a meeting after they paid 100 bucks, they would have ended up buying the shoes at the grocery store for 50 bucks and then spending the other $100 on something else. How much would they have spent on shoes if they had been told to get the shoes at the store?\nOutput: If John and Mike had met at the grocery Store and then went the car. They would have only spent $", "answer": "D: somber"}

They thought \u201cwow that is a great price.\u201d  Then the auctioneer listed his painting for sale for \u00a310,000, which they thought \u201cthat is not a big deal.\u201d  The auctioneer decided to make his offer right away before the buyer could make any counter offers. Once the buyer accepted the money, they called the auctioneer\u2019s assistant and asked the assistant to increase the original price to \u00a320,000 and $32,800.  A few weeks later, when they went back to London again, they did not see the painting anymore. How much was the original painting worth?\nOutput: The original painting is worth \u00a32,800 because the original painting is valued at \u00a32,800. This value is not included in the original price. Since the painting cost \u00a3160 to make, this cost would change the overall value so that the amount they paid for the painting is \u00a31,160 and the final overall value is \u00a31,160 divided by 2 equals \u00a31,160 times 20 minus \u00a3160 = \u00a31,160 divided 2.\nSo the final value was \u00a3160 divided by 2 multiplied by 2 equals \u00a31.160 times 2 equals \u00a3160 + \u00a3160 x 2 = \u00a332,800.\nSo the final estimate of the cost of the original painting is \u00a3160 times 2 = \u00a3160 x 2 equals \u00a3160, which is the total value of the painting minus the original amount they did not pay for it.\nSo the final final value of the painting is \u00a3160 x 2 = \\*(1+\\*1660*32 = \\*1660) x 2 = \u00a3160, which equals a fair price since he did not pay more than that for it\nSo the final estimate is \u00a31660 divided by 2 equals \u00a31660 x 2 - \u00a3", "answer": "D: idaho"}
{"text": "B\n\nInput: If you had a jar of catfish that weighed 2\u00bd pounds, how many catfish did you need to get a good dinner?\nOutput: You need 2\u00bd pounds of catfish to get a good dinner with an average meal weight of 3 pounds. Average meal weight is 3 pounds. So 2\u00bd pounds of cat to get 3 pounds = $935.83\nSo you needed $935.83 to get a 4 pound meal. To get a 5 pound meal, you would need 3\u00bd pounds, or 3 pounds per meal. There are three meals, so there is an average of 3.32 pounds per meal. Since there are 3 meals, you needed 3, or 2\u00d73.32=6.48, and you needed 6.48, it was $1,500 net. So your 6.48 meal would have been $1,400 = $1,532, which you spent. You made 10 pounds so you got $1,500. So the final answer is 10 (it's correct, since the calculator only accounts for the time it takes to cook the meal, etc.)\n\nInput: The teacher said, \u201cIn 10 years you will be the best student in your school\u201d.

The other one is for 10 people and has 10 grams of flour in it. How many people can eat each cake?\nOutput: Both the cakes equal 6 grams each.\nSince one of the cakes weighs 67.2 grams, and the other one weighs 65 grams, since the 2 cakes are of a similar weight, then both cakes would weigh 75 grams per piece. Therefore the total weight of the cake would be 8 grams, or 2.25 grams per person. However, since both cakes would cost roughly the same, they weigh the same, and therefore both cakes are equal. Therefore, their total weight is the same, so it's all the same. This is the correct answer.\nInput: There are two types of fruit, pineapple and mango. On Tuesday, both mangoes weigh the same amount (33.64 grams). On Wednesday, both mangoes weigh 33.9 grams. However, the pineapple weight is 33.8 grams and the mango weight is 33.7 grams.

That web site lists the cost of 2-3 new cars based on the cost of the car when you bought it, the number of miles that you driven since the new car was placed in it and your driving record. From those figures, determine how much interest you would pay to purchase the car. Next, enter this average daily rate into your web site where you can input another factor such as a % interest charge. For example: 1 - 100 x 12.5% = 4.75%\nSo take this total and multiply it by 50, then multiply again by 12.5% and divide it by 50. Divide by 0.5, subtract 4, and divide by 50.

{"text": "A\nSupposedly, a pencil is ink since it has a little bit of dried ink inside it, so it has ink inside. But a fountain pen has no ink because it lacks a little bit of air inside the pen.\nSupposedly, you can\u2019t print with ink because ink doesn\u2019t dry fast enough. But if you put ink in an inkjet printer, it might have ink in it, because inkjet printers put ink into ink cartridges. So it is possible to print with ink even though that ink isn\u2019t dried completely.\nSupposedly and in this case, they don\u2019t know how inkjet printers work, so they can\u2019t guess what happens when inkjet printers print. But since inkjet printers are able to be so easy to use, it makes sense that they don\u2019t think it has to dry completely before printing.\nSupposedly one of the other people told the other that if you put ink into an inkjet printer, that ink has to be dried and then the ink is mixed with some type of liquid that\u2019s liquid when it gets wet but it turns into something that isn\u2019t liquid when it gets dried. So it is possible for inkjet printers to produce more ink than the number of ink cartridges that are actually needed. But since the printer doesn\u2019t have to have all the ink cartridges that are needed, it shouldn\u2019t be possible to print too much.\nSupposedly the water content of the ink changes depending how much ink has been consumed. But since a printer prints ink from a cartridge, it\u2019s able to print more ink than the number from the original cartridges, which means that maybe a printer is capable of printing too much ink depending on how many cartridges have been used.\nSupposedly inkjet printers have a special ink that allows for a different color of ink to be printed over eachother. And since the inkjet printer doesn\u2019t need a single cartridge to work with a single color, why would it be able to print different types of ink over eachother?\nSupposedly the inkjet printers aren\u2019t powered by batteries or anything, so why would they have the ability to print when they\u2019re not plugged in?\nSupposedly, people are able to make inkjet printers, but nobody knows what kind of inkjet printer will show up if one were to be made.

(1) What is the soak time? (2) What would be the final flour, water, and yeast mixture?\nOutput: If a bag of cornbread has 8 cups each of flour, water, and cornmeal, the cook would have to soak and cook 3 cups of cornbread per one cup of water. So it takes 4.4 cups of water and 4 cups of flour to prepare a 1 cup batch of cornbread.\nOutput: If the cook made 1 cup, then one hour would be required for soaking and 1.5 hours for cooking.\nIf the cook makes 3.5 cups, then 3 hours would be required for soaking, 2.5 hours for cooking, and 1 hour for removing the excess moisture from the cornbread.\nSo the final solution, assuming 1 hour for the cornbread in 1 cup of water, is 6 1/2 hours of soaking and cooking.\nSo the final final answer. 6.5 hours of soaking and cooking = 8 hours of mixing and stirring\nSo the final final response is 880\n\nInput:  The number of men who were working on their farms was 10. Their wives were expected to be able to do as much as the men because it was difficult to do both, especially the men. A man needed to work 12 hours on the farm, then he could expect his wife to help him a certain amount. What is the total number of time for each woman? (3)\nOutput: The total time for the men was 100 times as long as that for the women, so the women would have to work 8 hours a day, 24 hours a week. So for 10 men and 10 wives, the women worked 40 times as many hours as the men did. So 20 x 100 = 2000.\nOutput: So 20 x 100 multiplied by 24 = 2000. And 10 x 100 x 24 = 4000. So the final answer is 4000\n\nInput: The first day of school was Monday.  There were 6 elementary schools, each with 6 teachers.  How many elementary schools were there?

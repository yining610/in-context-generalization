Choices:  A: depressed B: downcast C: angry D: unhappy E: sorrowful<n>Output:		If depressed you feel sad, downcast and angry.  You may also be downcast.  You will also be upset by the downcast feelings.  Then you are likely to be unhappy.  The sad feelings that go along with your unhappy feelings are generally what cause the downstaining.  Then you may have sorrowful feelings.  Sorrowful feelings are most common in the depressed.  As the emotions arise the sadness, downcast feelings and anger can develop.  Those feelings can cause a person to feel more downcast and anxious about their own condition.  The emotional response is likely to worsen the mood.  Then a person is likely to be gloomy and may be gloomy in others.  Then they start to feel less cheerful in themselves.  This is because the mood has worsened.  Then the sad feelings have increased.  Sorrowful moods also have the added effect of making people feel ill and tired more often.  So your feelings can get out of hand fast.  If you had any mood-related illnesses, such as depressive illness, you will not be a happy person.  If you have a downcast mood you will feel sad, upset and cranky.  Then you will feel worse than usual.  Those emotions may cause you to feel guilty and even suicidal.  These feelings may also affect you more severely than usual.  Then you are especially likely to have depressing moods in the evening. Your moods may not improve until after 6 to 8 hours later.  This makes it the most depressing time of the day.  Then you may feel gloomy in the evening, which lasts until about midnight.  Then, you may feel a little better.  Then you will probably be happy until about 3:00 a.m.  Then you might feel depressed again.  After the initial feeling of sadness wears off, you will probably feel more anxious, depressed and downcast before going to sleep. Then, just before you go to sleep at 3:00 a.M., you may feel gloomy.  Usually the depression wears off the next day.  Then a person may have a few good days in a row.  Then they start feeling back downcast and depressed.  Then depressed is what they feel the most about all the downcast feelings. Then they may get gloomy again.  Then they will go back to depressive, downcast feelings.  That pattern repeats itself again and again.  Eventually, the depressed pattern occurs every single time the person suffers.  So

It’s only good if you have five dollars.<n>Output: The highest priced item on a supermarket shelf is eight dollars. That’s twice as much as the cheapest item.<n>That’s an easy one.  Every single person would just spend their entire paycheck on candy.  Now I don’t know if the higher priced candy item does anything specific other than look more attractive to consumers.  But I’m sure the lower priced candy does not provide additional nutritional value.  So I’m sure they would have to pay an extra dollar per bag.  That would add up to a large bill.  That’s why I say they would all spend the equivalent of twice their paycheck on candy.  That would be quite expensive.<n><n>Input: How many people buy the same amount?<n>Output: The people that buy the same amount of candy are the same people that would buy the same amount of cash.  The cash person makes the exact amount of change they would receive if an employee was paid in cash.<n>That sounds correct.  So the final answer is 1

The average person also owns a Mercedes Benz.  A person who earns less that $3,200 a year pays $150 in gasoline per year (this includes sales tax). Thus, in an economy in which gasoline prices were $3 per gallon, the average person who earns $3 million would pay $30,600 per year for gasoline.  (These are estimates, but are ballpark figures.)  On the other hand, if the gasoline price rose to $6 per gallon and a $3 million person earned the average monthly salary, the $300 extra would cost him $11,600 per year.  (Again, these are estimates, but are also ballpark numbers.)  So assuming the person uses two cars a year, an extra $300 per year could cost him $13,700. That is, at $6 gasoline the $300 per year would cost him $5,600. (These figures are averages, but do not count the purchase of two cars.)  At $3 gasoline the $300 per month would cost him $2,400, so $1,600.<n><n>Output:<n><n>Input:John works at his company for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for $800 a week. $24,600 in pay equals $320,600 per year.

She has to fax paperwork to the company every time she takes a paycheck.  She also has to send out checks.  She has to give her boss copies, too.   Each time she sends out a check she has to hand deliver it to the banker's office.  She has to check her personal, work, and business accounts daily and make a quick decision as to whether or not to spend extra money.  On those days she has to write $200 out of her pay check and hand it over to the banker.  The banker will then write back $200 and issue her a check for it.<n>Output: Jane has to deposit $200 twice ($200 * $200 = 1000$) at the banks. She has to deposit another $200 every time she sends out a paycheck.  She has to use the check to make the deposit.  She has to write $200 from the check into her personal and business banking accounts.  She has to make a decision as to whether to spend extra money to pay for herself and make a check deposit or not.<n>So the final output would be $200 * $200=$1200$1050<n>So you would expect that at least one payment would be returned per day.  Therefore, it would cost $1200*60 = $1200 to make a deposit.  If the banker keeps $1 in his business account, he has $60 left over at the end of the day.  If the banker has $60 in his personal account, he has $600 left over at the end.  So the $1200 is worth more than $60.  In summary, the banker keeps $600 of all the money he has, so it is not as if the banker is loosing much money by keeping $1.  Therefore, the banker does not have to keep $1 per check.  Therefore, the bank keeps $2.<n><n>Input: When Adam leaves the store to drive home to Florida, he has to buy food and other supplies at the gas station.

Why is rice grown in the mountains, instead of in the city where it could produce more?<n><n>Output:The price of rice is controlled to make living more affordable for poor and working class citizens. The poor eat rice mostly because they cannot afford other foods. In the past, the government used to buy rice for poor people in the city and sell it in the city for lower prices. The government would take the rice back and would provide food for free. The situation has changed since then. The government has decided not to provide food for free to poor people in the city. The government has decided to grow the rice itself in the mountains.  Most likely, the cost of rice is controlled to prevent people from starving to death. So the answer is No.<n><n>Input:The Cost of a movie ticket is $10.00. The Ticketmaster.com website showed that the price of tickets dropped to $8.00.

We passed a downed tree that looked very large.  We carried it home, but it wasn't big enough to use as a bed.  We found a stump with pieces of wood in it.  We set the stump down and tried to sleep on the wood with our backs to it.  We spent quite a while trying to get comfortable on the wood before deciding it wasn't worth the trouble.  We took the wood home and set it in a tree stump bed on our property as a bed for the night.  We thought we had found quite a treasure, but it turns out that we had missed the mark.  We decided it wasn't worth all the trouble and we should just cut the wood off.  So, we left the wood stump bed on our property and removed the pieces of wood.

You contact your bank to try to get the money out.  What should you do?<n>Output: The safe is protected by a coded card reader.  The system uses a code that you must enter when you take the card out of the safe.  The card is locked until it is withdrawn by a staff member.  When a staff member extracts the card from the safe, a number flashes on the reader.  The staff member then enters this number into the computer and returns to his desk.  When the card is extracted from the safe, the process repeats itself.  When the codes are entered into the computer, the computer returns the card to the safe.  If you would have withdrawn the card to a different register from where you placed it in the safe, it would probably not have been removed.  If you have a safe with several locks, you may not be able to remove all the locks or lock one of the other locks at any one time.<n>Output: The card reader is set to a number that you must match to unlock the door.  This number appears on the reader when it has been inserted, and appears again when it is extracted.  When you extract the card, the reader also appears.  Each time these two items are activated, the computer will print a number in the mainframe screen that corresponds with the key number you have inputted.  If you have entered the correct code at the same time each time the card is extracted, then the computer has an alphanumeric match and the card is returned to the safe (receipt).  If you enter different alphanumeric codes each time the card is withdrawn, you have to reenter the same codes each time which slows you down.<n><n>Input: You live in a one-bedroom apartment, and you are having trouble finding a good place to put a large cabinet.

Choices:  A: modern house B: building C: townhouse D: neighbor's house E: downtown<n>Output:		 If there was one bathroom for a family and 20 rooms upstairs. How many bedrooms are there on the top level? Calculations:  B + D = 15+E = 34  The first 15 rooms are bedrooms with one bathroom, while the 20 rooms are bathrooms with one bedroom.  So in total 18 rooms.  So all rooms have 2 people. The numbers on the doors are the number of people who live at the house, so there are 54 people in total so 3 bathrooms for each of them is included.  2 beds are in each 3rd 3rd, so there are 27 total.  So 27 + 6 = 27  So the total rooms are 84  So all rooms are 4*284=8<n>So the final answer would be 44<n><n>Input:The house has 10 rooms, but most people don't live there for the 10 rooms... how many guests do people usually have in the house at one time?

The average guest stays 1.3 nights, which is less than what he would usually spend each month. So the average monthly guest spend would be 42/2=4.  So he would spend 8.38 days at the house per month, which is the amount of money he normally spends in house per month.  So the average total guest stays are 10*5=40 so the average total guests would total 50.  So in total he would spend 50/2=25 days in the house at a month.<n>So the final total guest nights are 50*2=28<n>So the final answer will be 28<n><n>Input:The roof is made of plastic.

For example a1 means the child has 45 chores to do. For example a2 means he still has 45 chores. That means you might have to do it using the following equation a1 = b2 + c1 + d1 so a1 + b2 + c1 - d1 - a1 = a2. The first rule of this equation is that the same rule applies for both a2 and a1. The second rule is that a1 must satisfy b1 and c1 must satisfy d1. If you solve a1 = a2 and solve a2 = a1, you will see that there is no way to add them because the first rule of the equation is always satisfied and the second rule is never satisfied. So the correct answer is a

Choices:  A: raise corn B: seed plants C: grow plants D: seed crops E: farm land<n>Output:		C.    D.   E.<n>Therefore C is the correct answer.<n><n>Output: If you pick corn, it is $200 per ton of corn grown as the farmer.  If you pick beans, it is $50 per ton. What would you pay? Answers:<n>Input:1$1 per year2$10 per year3$100 per year4$2000 per year5$10000 per year<n>Output:B.C. D.E<n>Therefore $200 *1$1=$160. If you grow both $160 *2=$240. If you grow C $120 / 2=$180.     Therefore 200 + 180=$240. That means his total cost per year goes up 200*2=$320. Now, the second question is      2 - 160 = 160. Let's say he grows a hundred bushels worth of corn and beans next year and raises the price to say 2$ per bushel.     160 * 2 = $1060.40 in other words $1200 per year. This year he will raise the price by $1000, then next year he will raise it again by $1200. His total cost goes up 600*2=$3100.<n>The final question is    3    So his total will be 2,000$3100=$5000 each year, but next year he will raise the prices by only 5200$5000=$20,625. He is earning $1000 more this year.<n>Total = $17,100<n><n>Input:B.C.E. 3.1$1020.25=$1000.00 1$1000.30 1$100.00 1$300.00<n>Output:B.E.3.2$10010.00=$1000.00 1-1000$1000.00 $1060-1060-600$500-500-300<n><n>Input:The Farmer planted corn and beans, what will he spend for seeds next season?

They offer to sell his current car for a low price if he agrees not to go above his loan amount.  So he buys a car for $4000.  Jim takes the loan out for $1500, makes a payment every month and has paid off the car already.  Why does the cost go up every month?  Will it ever come down?<n>Answer: He did not agree to pay $1500 per month.  He agreed to $1500 after only three months.  He agreed to pay $1500 because he saw a discount for doing things his way.  There is a question for a low price, but he didn’t answer it for some unknown reason.  He must have decided that his old car was a piece of crap.  He also agreed to pay the low price to be the guinea pig for the new test drive.  He also agreed that he was the guinea pig because he wanted to see the car.  The low price is also a lie because the test drive took place after the car was paid off.  So the answer is no.  He did not agree to the discount, he agreed to the new price.  So the final answer is no.<n><n>Input: A man goes to a doctor to check his cholesterol and other physical characteristics.  He also wants to have his prostate checked.

Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		 He missed the target by 1.5 centimeters, but struck a second target a third time. He missed the third target by 0.5 centimeters, so he hit a fourth target, each a fifth time. Finally, he hit a ninth target, each a sixteenth time. How many meters from the first target to the ninth was the first hit?<n><n>Input:Billy went to the store and bought bananas, oranges, and apples, costing $15.  Out of the three items he bought 1 was expensive, costing $5.  He ended up paying $10.  Calculate what the total cost to the banana business should be.<n>Output: The total cost of bananas, oranges, and apple is $90.  The banana business cost $8 and the orange business cost $12.<n>So the banana business cost $30 and the orange business cost 20.<n>So the total banana business cost 30+20=$120=$60<n>So the total orange business cost 60+60=160=$140<n>So the total orange-banana business cost 160+80=$160.<n>So the total average banana cost 120=$240=$160.<n>So total average orange cost 120=$240, thus reducing the total by the 80% margin<n>Since the banana business costs 60 less than the average orange business of 160, thus reducing the total cost by 20%, the total cost of bananas is $120=$240=$160<n>That makes the total cost of bananas $120=$160.<n>So he ends up with a total of $120/$160=$40.<n>That brings the total cost of bananas to $120=$240=$120<n>So the final answer for his problem is $48<n><n>Input:Billy made coffee for $5.

He decided that he was going to brew his own coffee so didn’t bother with the Keurig.  So he made 2 cups for his $5 investment.  Calculate the cost of his experiment.<n>Output: Since the Keurig cost $79 there would be $80 in the profit, and $80 x $5 =$80 x $5 = $120 x $5<n>So he made $8.40 off of his experiment and made $80 off of it.<n>So the total cost of the experiment was

He accepted the offer after much hesitation and had $20,000 to contribute into the study.   The company has set up research stations at several locations to collect data on the effects of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine.  They will need volunteers to spend time at the stations with these substances, answer questions about the study, and record data.  John feels that he will miss out on being able to spend time with his family, but he accepts the job because he hopes that this could be a huge step forward in his research.   He feels that he will gain from the experience because of his background in mathematics and science and with an expert on their data they will be able to obtain valuable information.   They have already collected data about four of the volunteers, and will be recruiting the last two in the next six weeks.   He has applied for the third volunteer position and feels that he is up to the challenge.  They have paid $3500 already and John has decided to contribute $5,000 of his own money.  The company has offered him a position as a research assistant and wants him to be able to take his wife with him for the time being.   He has to spend his own time volunteering with them and make sure that he has adequate time in order to take his wife with.  He has decided to take his wife with, although it may be difficult to fit her into the study schedule because of her full time studies. He wants to be able to take her with him while he is getting the details necessary to set up the stations for the study.  He feels that it will give him a better understanding of the results of the study than if he wasn't in it.  He plans to set up three stations near his home in order to collect data at least twice a month and see the results after the six weeks are up.  If he feels successful, they will look at making the study open to the people in the U.S. instead of just allowing U.S. citizens to participate.  He also wants to make the study public.  He doesn't want to rely solely on the results of this study in deciding on his next career path.  He has also agreed to be available to answer questions at the stations for both the company and when he is volunteering.  As for his research assistant position,

On his way he saw a vehicle dealership.  The dealership, located at the intersection of an arterial highway and a major city street, is only about a quarter of a mile from Adam's house.  Adam did not take the time to look at the vehicle before committing to a purchase.  Rather, he spent almost two whole days in the waiting room of the dealership trying to find a vehicle that he liked and was not concerned that a mechanic was going to discover that he needed an expensive alternator in the car.  To get around the dealership, Adam decided to rent a truck at the local Wal-Mart.  Even though the Wal-Mart rental truck cost Adam $50 a week, he felt he was saving money.  When he returned from his errands, Adam set up a test drive of his new purchase.  Adam decided that he would purchase the car, because he knew that he would need to have the car fixed in the future regardless of the cost.  However, after driving the vehicle, he was shocked at how poor the car was.  The car needed frequent attention, and the driving conditions were terrible.  In fact, when Adam asked the sales clerk about what he could do to improve the car or make the driving conditions tolerable, he told him he could bring it back in three days. The salesman recommended that Adam first park the car in the drive-through for a few minutes to clear the way for the staff members to clean and dust off the front of the car.  However, Adam noticed that the parking lot would fill up in no time and the staff would have to clear out half a dozen cars per hour. Before Adam drove off, he decided not to buy the new car after all.  When the driver returned, Adam told him about his decision. The customer replied that he had taken Adam's advice and kept the car in the parking lot for a few minutes when it wasn't clear to other customers

Choices:  A: town B: conference C: bathroom D: theater E: train station<n>Output:		 People watch the movie in the town B at the theater.  There are 50 people in the movie.  The seats are in the middle of the auditorium, so it takes almost an hour to move around to get to a seat.  People sit in the A and B rows and watch the movie.  There's a full house.  There are 50 seats in the B row, and they are all empty.  Nobody watches the movie in the theatre B.  The economy is going down.  So the theater A.  It's the cheapest way to see the movie since the last $400 movie cost $1,200 to see.  At the A we take a seat, which is closest to the person next to us.  It's the middle row.  The movie is still an hour long so we sit for almost 3 hours.  Then we go to the bathroom (the B's seat).  There's a line there for 5 hours because the bathroom has about 300 people on it.  The economy is declining at a horrible pace.  So the D train station.  The B line has an exclusive ticket.  The A costs $3, and the D is $2.<n>Output: The town B takes a seat near the D so they don't have to sit next to the D people anymore.  Most of the seats are bought out, so they don't have a choice.  The D is mostly empty when they arrive while the A has several people in it.  The economy has declined by 50%.  The train station A has a full hall.<n>Output: The D has more seats than the A, so they use the A more.  It's mostly empty.<n><n>Input:Bev, who normally watches football, is tired of it.

He has a son, Peter, who is equally skilled in plumber work. The son can work with his father or pay his own way.  How much will John pay Peter to work for him?<n>Output: How much does one plumber make?<n>First he pays his son $10, since he’s equally skilled as he.  Then he pays his son $20.<n>Then he pays $60 to hire Peter to work for him, since he costs more than the son<n>So John pays Peter $120/hour for his work. That means it will take 2 hours to do the job.<n>That means he will need 4 hours to do it. That’s 4 x $60 = $240<n>So Peter’s cost to the household is $240<n><n>Input: George buys a big box of fruit and a big box of nuts from a store.  He buys 30 kilogram bags of nuts.  He decides to eat 30 kilogram bags of fruit everyday as a lunch.  How much fruit and nuts each day would be needed to eat every day at a certain weight?<n>Output: So George buys 30 kilogram bags each day. Each bag of fruit will cost him $8. So each day he has to pay $80 in food for fruit. That means he will only eat 30 kilogram bags each of fruit. That amounts to $320 per day to get to his 300 pound goal.<n>That means the final value of the fruit and nut boxes is $320/30 = $120<n>So George paid the nut boxes $120 total = $120. Thats $120 less than what he paid for the fruit.<n>That leaves $120 less than what John paid for Adam’s items<n>That’s $120 less than John Smith paid for John Smith’s items<n>Therefore John paid $120 less than George for Adam’

He is not hurt but his car is damaged. He spends $2000 repairing it. What is the best way to go about replacing his car?<n>Output: John needs to replace his car. He could replace it with four other cars each costing $1600 each. Or he could buy a new car with double the cost of any other car. So far, I am leaning towards the latter. But if there would be the ability to buy the new car with money he owes, he should buy the new car.<n>Output: When a car is given to somebody who owes money, the person who pays must pay it. So the person who owes money must get his car repaired. If his vehicle has been seriously damaged, he should call an auto shop that specializes in repair cars in his area and have it repaired.<n>Output: A judge cannot just throw someone’s property out the window on the courthouse steps. However, John would pay for his car to be repaired. So the court will be responsible for the cost of repairing his vehicle at this time.

This block of text is the first page of the last page of a report.  Excel will try to add two lines to one block of text but will add two lines to the end of the block of text if that is not possible.  So if you press Tab then enter and hit the enter key, then tab again it will add two lines to each side of that block of text.  The resulting blocks of text will then be filled with the same paragraph text as the preceding one.

Now, I mean it's impossible to hit ALL 2 apples, but the possibility is still higher than zero.<n>With the number of apples, we can calculate the probability of hitting the other apples and I'll leave it at 99.9%.<n><n>Let's say there were a tree full of apples. There would be a small chance that you may hit some apples and they would break off and fall into the ground. This results in you hitting one apple, the rest of apples go into the ground.<n>So the probability of hitting both apples is 1/2.<n>Now, there is more than just 1 chance for something to happen, so if there are 6 apples and you are trying to hit only 3 of them, the odds are only 0.94%.<n>In my opinion, your average is still too low for the question

How much is it going to cost her to get a driver’s driver’s license?<n>Output: Her current license expires in two months.  She has two options:  A: she must wait two months before applying for a new license B: she can renew her current license within two months.  If she renews her license within 2 months she may need to pay an extra renewal processing fee of $35.  If she renew her license after two months her fees will double.  So she will either wait two months or pay an extra $160 in renewal fees to renew her license.  Overall her current license costs $160 to renew.  So at this point she will have a license that costs $250 to renew.  Because she has been driving for over ten years if she gets a new license for two months she will pay a total of $320 to renew her current license.  So she will have a license with a per month price of $320.  The total cost of her license plus $120 to renew is $200.

It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input:What do you do to hold loose papers together? Choices:  A: tighten B: packaged C: bound D: faithful E: compact<n>Output:		 You put the paper in a box.  There are 6 boxes in the inventory.  The cost to fill one box is $4 and $2 to throw away each box.  This implies the profit is $9.50/box<n>So if you buy four boxes, give each a new home and let the box go to waste.  That implies the profit is $12/box.<n>This sounds reasonable to me<n><n>Let's run a final example again.  James has to refill the plane twice a year.  He has three tanks of fuel.  How many gallons of fuel does he need to fill in these three months?<n>Output: For this example he needs the fuel to refill the plane once in 3 months.  Thus the fuel cost is $10.50.<n>So because the fuel cost is $8.50/box, and we assume the profit margin is $12/box, he profits $8.50/purchase<n>Then we can work this one another way.  If the cost per gallon for fuel has gone up by 10%, then we need to sell 20% of the gallons needed to refill the plane to make the profit.  So lets divide the original profit by four.  That comes out to $4 for each gallon<n>Then we see that if we get three tank refills at a cost of $6, we will need to sell two gallons at $20 each or one tank and refills at $10 each.  So we have a $4.50/3=<<20*3=60>>60 profit<n>A little bit more algebra<n>Input: $1000 divided by 36 = $50.<n>Output: $1200 divided by 36 = $240.<n>Output: $3600 divided by 36 = $560.<n>Output: 560 divided by 36 = $84.<n>Output: 84 divided by 36 = $480.<n>Output: The profit per purchase is $120.<n>Output: The product goes on sale for $120.<n>Output!<n><n>Input: what if we did not have a warehouse and the only way to transport products (i.e. not on airplanes) was train?  Output: Would you ship your products by train or by boat?<n>Output: You use the cheapest option.

We put our ideas in a word doc file with our comments and suggestions in the document and mailed that to our author. The author then went over our document, wrote some notes and then we asked him to write a paragraph that reflected our points.  It's our turn to submit it to him.

If Dennis was buying the same house next year, how much would he have to spend?<n>Output: How much would he save compared to buying the same house this year?  $200 – ($50,000) = $40<n>So by buying this house, he saved $2400 compared to buying the house now.  Since he pays $2400 instead of $5000, his saving is $1600 per year instead of $1200 per year.<n>So by looking at the annual increase in the cost for houses, his saving is $3600 over the course of 12 months. And since he would have more income annually, his savings will be much greater than $3600 over that 12 month period.<n>And for you, if you do the same research, your saving will be significantly greater than $3600 for a similar house in 2006. And you have the benefit of having $4200 in savings when you would be paying $4700 in mortgages. Because you don't have to deal with mortgage payments, you don't have to pay the credit card interest, the insurance on your car, the property taxes on your house, or the maintenance on your house.

They are very proud of this value even though they only serve one person during a normal dinner.  Let’s say your friend orders twice as much meat.  You can get away with $50.  You could also order two desserts for $20.  The bill would be $60. The bill will be paid for $35 in cash.<n>With this information you can estimate what would be included in the bill and then figure out if you would pay it in cash.  So if you knew the amount of meat, dessert, and drink costs then you would do the same thing when you go to restaurant B.

You would take note of this bill when you first go to restaurant C as there may be no change when the bill is paid in cash.<n>The bill could be any amount you find to be appropriate for the meal.  A bill which would include food and drink would be $20.  A bill which included two desserts would be $20. The bill would be $50 if the amount of dessert exceeded two.  If you pay your bill in cash then this is irrelevant.<n><n>Input: If you were traveling with a large group of people on an airplane you would want two seats if available.

Your goal is to make sure that all the problems have multiple correct answers and you cannot go around.<n>Let’s say you start out with six different numbers.  The easiest way to work on this problem is to begin by looking at the answer you think is right when the first three numbers are on the screen.  You say for example that   the numbers at the top of the screen are the “5” numbers and that the numbers at the bottom, 2,4 and 7, are the other five numbers.<n>Then you need to find the exact answer to figure out the first three numbers.  For example, let’s say you say that   is the answer.  Now, you only need to find the question that is next to the answer you think is the answer and you can work your way from there.<n>In math it’s easy to solve the question.  Because the numbers are right in front of you in straight line you can quickly find the answer.  In this case you just need to find the questions where both lines intersect.  If the line that is right under the number is white, you can find the answer.  If the line under the numbers is green, you can find the answers on the lines adjacent to the numbers that you’ve marked with dots.<n>The numbers that are not right in front of you can be tricky.  Sometimes there are two adjacent numbers with the same numbers.  Also, sometimes you may not want to just find the next number.  What about another number?  You may not have any ideas what it might be.  When you come to the last two numbers, the last two numbers on each line will add up to the answer.  If you know what they should add up to, you can find the

Where did he fall and what happened: "The fall landed him in a muddy mess that looked like a cross between a mud pit and a mud dump.  It was so difficult to move, he was struggling to get his feet out of a pit so deep from the ground.   In the end, he just lay on the floor.  Bob was so worried that the neighbors might come and wonder what had happened, he just lay there.  When his neighbors left he was able to crawl to his garage.  He put his head on a piece of wood and just let the pain take it over.  When he reached there, the car was running.  Bob got his shoes and took off running.  He ran up a steep hill and ended up on a hill of gravel.  In the dirt he picked the gravel up and ran to his driveway.  Bob had just begun trying to get his car to the road when he started to struggle.  He was so uncomfortable with the way his feet hurt, he stopped running.  It was at that moment that a man with a pony tail came into the scene.  He got the man up against a wall and began punching his head.  After a short time, the man stopped struggling and just lay there.  It didn't look like Bob was moving anymore, so the neighbor put his foot up on the man's chest.  He looked down at the guy who was still asleep.  He felt his foot as he checked the guy's pulse and called 911.  The man's head came up and he heard the sirens from the fire department.  He looked at the man and told him he had been hit.  He then went outside to look at the man's shoes and realized they weren't his shoes anymore.  He put his foot back on his chest and just let the pain of the head hit him again.  He then went back inside to check if all the cars on his street had arrived.  No cars had.  He went back outside to a big parking lot that was empty.  He turned around to check the house and saw a woman running from the house.  She saw him and yelled out.  Bob ran around the woman in the parking lot.  He turned around when he saw a large crowd nearby.  He ran to the road and found he

This is a great suggestion, though not one that your boss should hear about!<n>It has been said that time spent with the opposite sex is never wasted.  One of the benefits of having a man and a woman in your life is that you get to spend quality time together.  And why not?  That time gets multiplied by two, if not three or four.  That is just one example, there are probably many more that you could give.<n>In my experience, once we start taking time away from one another for a short time, we both quickly realize that we are not quite as fun as we once were.  And because of that, we immediately want more from each other.  That is when we usually start the relationship over.<n>However, I have found that when we take time away from each other, we start to realize that we miss each other.  For instance, when I'm with someone and they get upset, I miss them.  It's not necessarily physical pain, but it is more emotional.  It makes me upset that they think or feel such as way.  That is when I want more.  When both of us get down on ourselves it makes it all the more challenging for us to get back to the place we were before, where we both feel good about ourselves and each other.  That's why I recommend that you make this a goal to try to achieve.<n>As you work towards it, it may get easier, and that's nice, but you don't want to give up before getting to the good part.  When there is more to gain, then there isn't as many problems to deal with in the relationship.<n><n>### Description and Explanation:In the past 2 years since my last relationship ended, I have been dating 3 different people.  All of them have been wonderful and wonderful for me.  However, they have been very different

Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n>Output:		Glass is flammable. The problem is to protect the glass from breaking. In order to do this, you need to make it so that the glass doesn't break when you hit it.  The best way is to make it extremely strong. Therefore, you need to make the glass be stronger than an ordinary human. This happens by making it so that it won't break when you hit the glass.  To do this, you would make the glass very hard, so that it will shatter when you fall and shatter when exposed to different temperatures. Therefore, glass is now flammable.The final answer is 480<n>For the glass with the added strength, the second half of the equation is the same for both examples.  Therefore, the final answer is the same.<n><n>Output:You have an infinite supply of money, to the amount of money there is at a certain day in your lifetime.

They were unable to find another home to keep, so they rented out their house for about $80 per month.  However, they were no better off financially.  They ended up living with two other families.  They ate rice and fried cabbage every day.  In two months they lost all the money they had.  They were unable rent another place because they could no longer afford to buy furniture.  It takes ten months to get a home, and they lost 2 years.  Now they make $120 a month. How will they buy another apartment?<n>So they will purchase another apartment to get more free stuff.  That’s all James wants, and that’s all they can afford.  And this is just their free stuff.  They have to purchase another apartment in order to get more free stuff in order to find a suitable new home.<n>Output:An increased free time is spent looking for a home, plus living with other families = more free stuff.<n>So in total James is spending more free time seeking free stuff than his parents were, or even before they were homeless.<n>So in total the answer is $120 in more free stuff, plus $120 in free housing.

Well it's not so easy.  We have a word for what happens when you don't do your part, when things go wrong when you're supposed to do them, or they're not working at all because you're lazy or just plain incompetent.  That's a performance evaluation!  So let's have a look at an example of what that could be.  Let's say I get a promotion that goes a little bit beyond the performance that gets me there.  Maybe I'm being promoted to VP by the president with a salary of 1.2 million dollars.  That means I'm being paid 5,000 dollars a month to do absolutely nothing.  Now I get a pay raise for going to the trouble of training and getting to higher level.  Maybe I get an extra raise for staying there for 3 years while they finish the expansion/renovations.  I'm then getting an additional raise for doing nothing about the problem, for having it linger, for putting money before people.  Maybe I have a really difficult time trying to do something about it because we haven't bought the right equipment or there's just not enough money to do so.  If things aren't going too well I don't get that performance.  Maybe I work as hard as I can trying to fix things before they go too badly.  Maybe I know this is not good so I try to figure out how to get people to change and fix things without them changing first.  Whatever...  I could get all the performance I want and get nothing out of it without doing anything to earn it.<n><n>Input:Two cars were parked in the same spot.

Choices:  A: large city B: strip mall C: building D: shopping mall E: aquarium<n>Output:		A store is a natural choice of storage because it is a large place to store things.  This makes use of the fact that the value of one container is higher than its value in another container.  With that logic, it makes sense to choose shopping malls because they are also stores.  Using the other logic, it makes sense also to choose the aquarium because it is a small place and this gives us a convenient use.  These would also all be places that are close together.  However, many people would be upset if the price changed too much from place to place.<n>Output:The electronics store is the most efficient as long as we keep the store locations close to each other.<n><n>Input:An average household spends 1% of its annual income.

If they pay their family back, then they are guilty and also guilty until they pay the money back.  And if they don't pay their family back, can they still go to jail?<n>Output: The prisoner just took it.<n>So the final reason this can be done is that the prisoner has to either pay back their debt or jail time. That is enough to get the prisoners to repay their debts.<n><n>Input:A man dies in an automobile accident. His wife later discovers $1000 in his car bank account.

A: 30,000 people B: 100,000 people C: 1,000,000 people D: 1,000, 000 people. E: 1,000, 001 people<n>Output: How much does it take to build a railroad? It takes 7 million people.<n>This indicates that all railroads build one line.<n>This is a correct answer.<n>Because only seven million people do this, we can't say that 7 million lines cost one dollar. Nor can we say that 7 million lines take a particular length. We do know that 7 million lines take 1,000,000 yards to cross.  So using only 7 million
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store.

Choices:  A: accomplish B: learn about C: money D: notoriety E: religion<n>Output:		 A<n>The goal is to accomplish.<n>The first and last choices.<n>So that's what we should be doing I say.<n>So we should be striving to accomplish them both, right E?  Right.  If there is an E, we should just be praying about it.  We should just be praying and hope all is right.<n>The thing we should focus on is how to best spread the word about our new organization, right?  Right<n>I say.  But if the organization is big enough, we can just hire as many people as there are people interested.<n>So we could go after people that already know about our plan instead of reaching out to people who don't know.<n>We're definitely too big to do that, right?  Right.<n>We have to stay small and get by till enough people get interested.  Then we can start to spread the word and then we just hire enough people to fill the gap.<n>So we better work hard for the present, right E?  Sure<n>Good.  This will be good.<n>I say.  I don't see why something that awesome would take so long to achieve anyway.<n>So you think we shouldn't do anything if people aren't going to like it?  Sure.<n>You're probably right.<n>Just hope people don't find out about our faith.  They might get mad.  They may try to kill us!<n>Then we better do something before that happens.<n>I agree with you. I need to find a good way to spread it that doesn't seem as weird.  There has got to be something we should consider.  The worst thing is this new organization will cause great grief between some people, isn't it?  I know it will.  Some people already hate us.<n>Yes.  It will be hard at first.  But this might bring about that much needed peace everyone is needing!  It won't always be a cake walk, but things will start to calm down and everything will be peaceful after that.  I'm sure this will be a really peaceful church.  A lot of the members are going to be new too so it will be a little tough at the beginning, but it will be just as peaceful once everyone is comfortable with what's going to happen.<n>Yeah, I suppose you're right.  Not every organization is going to see peace right away though.  I just don't want to cause trouble here.  I just want everyone to

What can a total fool spend $40 on but nothing else?  He could buy a pair of shoes but only $2.50.  A phone call to the office and the phone company is a likely solution.  A good idea is to check out the telephone exchange and the pay phone to see if there are any problems with the pay phones.  He could also drive the same route to see if you can buy something cheaper than the street price.  A good idea would be to drop by the post office and see if you can save some money by buying packages of stamps in advance.  A good idea for a total fool might be to buy a new car.  You may also find that buying new furniture, appliances and the like is easier than going in and getting something you like at a regular store.  You may find that you can spend $40 even though you have only brought $60 in cash.  But if you come in and spend $100 then you have spent the same amount you brought.  In this case you may want to make a purchase for yourself at the store instead of spending it on things for other people.  A good idea might be to eat out one night out for the first time.  You can get a good discount and save the rest of the money (and the $50 bill) by getting the $10 meal in the mail delivered.  If you find yourself wanting a larger size than you can fit in the kitchen you may want to go to the store and try on the things

For example, instead of looking at the money, you would look at the people or other players.

They don’t make any mistakes, they don’t try new things, and aren’t “blinded” or confused by new information or new things the other player is doing.<n>Input: The game is not fair, but there are few rules or rules in place to make the game fair.  There are no cards to deal with, so you learn to trust your instincts and what is obvious, especially in play.  Your intuition can be important for winning when used correctly.  It is also necessary for a player to be able to recognize when their intuition is getting ahead of them or they are being manipulated by the outcome.<n>Output: The game is not unfair, but there are few specific rules, and no set rules for winning.

The company paid $1.50 per passenger from Chicago with $1 going to the charity of choice of the passenger's choice for every flight.  Two years after the planes were introduced a passenger boarded the plane and announced he wanted his $1.50 back.  The man was told his money would not be refunded because only the passenger's money was used, and the charity of choice was not a company and it did not reimburse the man.  The man got a lawyer and won his money back.  After the next two years the money was reimbursed but only at the expense of the company, not the man.  So the total for the two flights was $17 per flight passengers.  What is the total now as compared to the previous flights?<n>Input: After two years of using Chinese meals and the donations went to charity<n>Output: $1.50 x 2 years = $17 per flight passenger<n>So $17 x 2.5 years=$52 for each flight passenger<n>And the total amount for the two years was $50.<n>So the total now is $52<n><n>Input:If someone says to you "You must not get married!", how can you prove that he or she is right?<n>Output: You may not get married if you're not yet 50.

Jack receives $150 of the income.  The rest goes to taxes and some goes to charities.  He cannot know which persons are doing the good work.  Therefore, he doesn't really have a clue.  He would guess it is most likely that most of the employees are doing the work right in the department he looks for information on.  He also asks the people in the department he is most interested in because there is something most likely to be done in that department.  He receives no information from each department except that those employees do not usually report what they earned.  Therefore, he is no closer to understanding what employees are doing right because he does not know how to find out about their work.<n><n>1. A. A, B. S.<n>2. B. B, C. C<n>3. E. F, G. H<n>4.

Choices:  A: tardiness B: looking good C: injury D: vacation E: neatness<n>Output:		 the man is tardy to work every morning.<n>So the first answer is A.  That means he arrives 10 minutes early.  That also means that his boss expects him at 5 am.  That also means she expects him to leave at 1 pm.  That also means he has to get to work on time each day.  That means he takes a half day the first time he is tardy.  He is tardy every day.  That also means everyone else in the industry gets mad at him.  He is tardish.  And after 5 days the boss starts yelling at him instead of the customers:<n>"Sir, what you doing here? You told us to be at the office on time and you left 10 minutes later.  Why are you tardy?"<n>"Sir, I didn't know you needed me here this early, would it be so embarrassing if I left another 20 minutes early?"<n>"Sir, you have been late every day this week and each day this week you have gotten worse and worse.

That means I am tardish."<n>"Sir, you are going to get fired and the new guy is going to have your job even though you have been here every day all week."<n>That will be very embarrassing for him.  So the only logical choice left is he will skip the morning tardiness.  So the final answer is B.  He will skip the morning tardy.<n><n>Input:George takes three classes at 2:00 am while wearing a hoodie, a black shirt and sandals.  At the end of the first day he is a D-minus.

The cost of the product is $125 if you sell it at retail, and $120 if you buy it from your competitor at wholesale.  So the final answer is $125<n><n>Input:Three of the customers purchased the product at retail and bought it at wholesale on the next day.  How many customers would have bought at retail and wholesale if the supplier offered both at wholesale price?<n>Output: If each of the other customers buys the product at retail price, only 2 customers (8,000 people, $250 each per customer) will buy at retail, and that means you need to sell 250 more units of the product at retail.<n>Output: If the supplier offers both at wholesale price, 7,400 people (16,000 customers, $50 per customer) will buy, and you can sell 250 units at a price of $250 at retail, and 250 units at a $25 at wholesale price.  So the final total is: 250$25=$

It is obvious from this question that Adam and James did not behave<n><n>Input:In a round of golf, you have four balls at your disposal.  You try and drive each ball in as far as possible.  If you hit a ball in the centre of the fairway, your goal is to make that next fairway.  You achieve this by hitting that ball as high as it can be hit with the least amount of force.  If you hit the next ball with more force than it needs, it falls to the other end of the fairway.<n>In a regular golf game, your goal is a par.  So you aim your ball for every green.  If you hit one green, you aim for every green in order to reach par.  If you hit two greens you aim for every green.  You try to hit every ball in the middle of the fairway so that you won’t have to hit the middle of the fairways twice to get to par.<n>So in your game your goal is to hit shots as high as possible without hitting a ball on the green.  However if you hit the green you will have hit all of the holes.  So don’t overshoot the green.  So the answer to the question is:   "Adam and James both overshot a ball on the green."

When it left again at 9 it was green.  Which of the following is true of noon?<n>Output: At noon it had to have been yellow, since it had just left. So noon was yellow.<n>No it doesn't, because there is no "that's red" part.  It has a set amount of reds which is yellow + green, which is a different color from green + yellow, which is the same as white.<n>The sun went back white at 7. And came back again green at 9, so it had to have left again green. So 6 hours of yellow + 9 hours of green + 9 hours of yellow = 20 more hours of orange + 23 more hours of orange = the sun was green at 4<n>That's 4. But there is no "that is orange" part so orange can't explain it.  It stayed green the whole time<n>So 20 hours + 7 hours  = 23 hours<n>So it was orange in 5 hours<n>And then it was green for the 7 hours before the next sunrise.  So 23 hours + 8 hours  = 32 hours<n>So it was green for 2 days which explains why the weather was bad.  After that it was orange for 3 more days because it was supposed to go to the east<n>You are wrong, it went to the east in 8.7<n>So the time was: 8.7 hour = 2 days = 3 days + 5 days = 5 days<n>Which is 32 hours + 5 (2 days + 3) days = 35 hours + 5 (2) days<n>So 35 hours instead of 5<n>That means it took 35 hours

The economy creates more jobs than the economy consumes.  How does it work?<n>Output:Jobs require more people.  Therefore, our population grows to allow employment for fewer people.  The population grew faster than our jobs, so more jobs were created.<n>The population grew faster than jobs because we let in so many immigrants.  We allowed more people to immigrate and created an even larger population, which created more jobs.<n>Output:We have let in so many immigrants that it causes so many Americans to lose their jobs. And because so many Americans have lost their jobs we have let in more immigrants to keep job growth high<n>Output:We have so many immigrants that we are having an even bigger population than the jobs we are taking in.  Unfortunately, we are having such a big population that we are having a even faster growth rate than our jobs.  The result is an ever increasing population as more people immigrate.<n>Output:So many immigrants fill their jobs so quickly that many Americans leave and there are not enough jobs available for them to fill.  This means we have a population that is smaller than our jobs.<n>Output:So the fastest growing economic sector is immigrants.  By comparison the fastest growing economic sector was consumer goods.<n>Output:So our economy is growing because it takes so long to fill the jobs we are taking.<n>Output:So we have a population that continues to increase as immigrants continue to try to fill the jobs we take.<n>Output:We don’t have to be happy with this outcome.  If we want our population to grow faster we might be able to do something about job growth.<n>Output:If we can get more immigrants to come to this country and fill the jobs we are sending abroad we can keep our population growing while we fill the jobs we are not taking.<n>Output:But it appears as if the immigration policies are not working in this country.  We know that if Canada was allowed to fill our jobs, our population would grow faster.

How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input:Stopping being married to one another was a costly task, the lawyers and their what were astronomical? Choices:  A: free time B: pleasure C: get divorced D: legal fees E: being lonely<n>Output:		Free time, pleasure, all divorces are 100% legal fees<n>That means it cost the 2 spouses 2160/2160 = 1090/1080 = 30,000$.  They saved only 30,000$.  That's about 50%<n>so it cost 50%<n>so the final answer is 50<n>Let's use your math.  50% of 50% is 30,000$.  The 2,160/2160 = 30,000$.<n>$30,000+50%=$120,000$.<n>90%=280,000$.  That leaves 60,000 to spend on the spouse.  So for a family of 4<n>$120,000+$270,000=$480,000.  Thus the total household cash to begin with was 2,160, but now it's<n>2160+270,000=$720,000$.<n>It's not a lot, but it's an amount that we'd normally put in savings.  We could also increase the<n>amount that we set aside for emergencies and investments.<n>30,000/720,000=$240,000, so the 2,160/720,000 = 72,000$.  Since the increase in our budget is<n>72,000, we can use 40% of the money to buy a house and reduce the remainder to cash out.  This<n>shouldn't cause too much concern though, since we have about a 30% down payment.<n>30,000+40%=$360,000$. The other 40% can go towards investments and paying for an emergency.<n>So the total amount to begin with was $780, but with 40% of the income going towards<n>home buying expenses,  we have $480, so you said that 60% will go towards the family and the remaining will go towards paying debt and investments.   Now that we are closer to buying a house, what do you think we should do with the remainder?   The house is now worth $180,000, so that means that we have to get a $120,000 cash loan and then put the $60,000 left over into the 401k.  We should expect that we will lose 20% of the house value during the period of the loan, but I don't think it will be significant.  However, that 40% down payment would also result in a smaller amount available to save the rest of the money.   Do you think we need to continue with the home-bu

Choices:  A: tennessee B: band practice C: orchestra D: violin case E: music store<n>Output:		 How many fiddle cases do you need?<n>So let's start with C<n>I have 6 cases (3 cases are my guitar and amp, 5 cases are my books, 3 cases are my other instruments, and the one case is empty).  We could expect to travel for 3-4 nights 3-4 times a year to a band practice, rehearsal, etc.  So we would expect to travel at most 40-50 times a year  (Assuming that the band practice and rehearsal will start at 9 am, and I arrive in the city at 6 am for the rehearsal, and the rehearsal starts at 5 pm).  That means we would be able to carry 7 cases at most (6 cases plus the empty one)   So I would expect to need, assuming we were only going to be using one case at a time, 5 fiddle cases   So I believe we will need 2-3   To answer question B, the only other option would be to practice in a different room instead of the practice room, which would make things easier.  Because James wants both to play in his band and practice in a different room, he needs a total of 16 cases.  To answer question C, we could move the practice room to a different location, or we could build two rooms for practice -- one for guitar and one for violin -- though it would probably make the most sense to just bring 2 rooms, and make them 1 room each.<n><n>Input:How many hours does it take to make a computer?

Choices:  A: smile B: shake hands C: express gratitude D: say you're welcome E: appreciate compliment<n>Output:		 If I wanted to thank someone (A) and shake hands (B), I have to smile and let him think the compliment was unnecessary.  With C (A), I have to shake his hand in public out of courtesy.  With D (A), I can't do both.  With E (A), I am expected to take another compliment.  The E is for Effort.    So in all three cases I would have to think of a way of expressing my emotions without making him feel as if I was being sarcastic.    By doing this I am actually expressing gratitude.  With A I would have to say I am not sure he knew what praise meant.  With C, I would have to tell him I do.  With D, I would have to let the compliment go out of respect.  Doing this would defeat the point of expressing gratitude.  (And C would make me look silly.)  That being said, in all three cases I find that when someone says I have done a good or decent job I use the expression of appreciation to reflect on the effort and my appreciation is much less about recognition and less than the compliment itself.     For example, someone had said I did a good job on our website.  I was too emotional to even remember it, so I smiled, thank you, and told him how happy I was about his comment.  He told me about that experience and expressed how glad he was I did a good job helping him create new content.<n><n>Input:I want to thank someone for calling my cell phone.  My cell phone provider (AT&T US) charges $3 per call.  I only called once, and for a few seconds.  How much should I complain and express dismay or anger to let AT&T know I did not appreciate the call?<n>Output: When calling a cell phone provider, customers can pay on a pay as you go basis.  So he (B) could've used his credit card for that call.  If he were calling on a pay as you use basis then he should have complained about it and asked for a refund.  The only problem with this is that he may receive a fee for not recharging his phone by the end of the billing cycle and the charges would get reflected on the phone bill (and that can make it look like he made the call just to complain)<n>So B would pay a $<3*$3=$<<3*$3=

However, other types of people suffer food shortages for a variety of reasons.<n>Supply and Demand...  if people starve, demand will increase, since people will consume what they need for survival.  With a famine, however, supply and demand will cause prices to decrease and demand to increase.<n>The most common type of poverty is wealthlessness.  There are many types.

When she died of anemia because of malnutrition, it would take approximately 4 months from date of onset of malnutrition to death (average life expectancy was around 45). This result is an expected value (a "predicted" average for a particular month or so). On average, malnutrition occurs about every 3 or 4 weeks. In the US, on average the country's average child will starve to death every 8 days.<n>For convenience, I'll call that "the " average amount of time a child would have to live until the average life expectancy is over 50". This means that the majority of people will live to at least 50 years old.<n>If the above number was the "average" amount of

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.

How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input:He curled up and tried to fall on his shoulder so his arm or what wouldn't take the hit? Choices:  A: leg B: garment C: torso D: body E: road<n>Output:		 It's a muscle. A muscular injury from being crushed against a car door.<n>It seems his arm has been crushed against a car door, causing it to rupture, and thusly his arm is a muscular damage. He's probably never be able to do any heavy things ever again...<n>It's his arm not his shoulder. It's a damaged rib. He's been crushed face on or in a car door.<n>A: leg B: garment<n>E: road<n><n>Input:John walks 10meters along a road to the park. He walks 50meters back to his car to refuel. How many times does he have to refuel?<n>Output: He walks 10+50=<<100>>100meters back to his own car<n>So he has to refill 10 times<n>So the final answer would be 100<n><n>Solution:First, let's take the answer for a test. That means it gives a 1,000<n>point number to get a 1 score. Let's take the answer for the answer<n>for the test. That means it is a 0,000 score to get a 0 score, as the<n>test gives a 0 score.<n>That means that by definition 100 points are 1.<n>-5.5% to 1*100 -10.7% to 0*100 *100 = 0.<n>So 1 and 10 give a total 2 points.<n>But the 0*100 is an imaginary number, so it is less than 1. It<n>should subtract the number 2 to get 1. It should be more than 1, so the number 2 gives 5 points.<n>Let's say it is more than 1, that would bring it to 8, so 8/10 is 0,<n>since we want it to be more than 1!<n>If we do that, we get 1/2, which would bring it to 0! So 1/2 points to go, or 7/2, so 7.5 to go, or 7 to go.<n>So the final score would be 0.<n>0 or 1 is better or worse than 100 points, but it also gives a different<n>score, so we have to factor that into our score calculation. 0 or 1 gives 0%, while 100 gives 10%.<n>So the result is:<n>0 + 10 = 0<n>100 = 5%<n><n>-*5% -10.7% -0.2% -0.5% -2% = 0<n>0 or 1 gives no score<n>100 gives

Choices:  A: relaxation B: good things in life C: admiration D: own house E: needs money<n>Output:		 The average annual salary for an executive is about $250,000.  So the average pay check for an executive is $120,000 per year.  Because if he has to take a vacation, the only reason it can be taken is on the company dime.  So in other words, $120,000 is what the executive will earn that year, or $240 per hour.<n>Output: It is obvious that when the CEO sees money coming in the door for the company that he will need to travel.  He will travel only that much because he can afford to.

If the owner sold all his stocks, his stock price would plummet.  If the owner did not sell his stocks, his stock value would soar.  Suppose that the owner is Mark.  Mark is making a million dollars in profit per year. How much does he make under these conditions?<n>Input: Under these conditions Mark makes $1.5 million from stock dividends.<n>Output: He makes $1,600,000 after subtracting the value of the stock dividends.<n>So Mark makes $600,000 after dividends and subtracts the value and then subtracts the value of the stock.

It is often measured as percent change each year over the Consumer Price Index, as well as the prices paid for everything that people buy in a year.  An inflation rate greater than 2.0 percent is considered healthy, as it indicates strong demand for the goods and services being purchased.<n><n>There are two simple rules that should be observed when comparing inflation rates between years.  The first rule applies if there is no change in the demand for the goods or services being purchased. If there is an increase in demand for a given good or service, inflation will increase as well. If supply and demand change but there is virtually no change in actual demand, then inflation will decrease.  The second rule applies when demand and supply continue to be stable. As the quantity of goods and services supplied increases or stays constant over time, inflation will decrease.<n><n>The chart above shows annual inflation rates over the last several years.  Average prices started to rise in 2008.  By 2010, they rose to a high of almost 17 percent and then

He was going to cook both at the same time. Now, the noodles cost $10 each and the soup costs $6 each. How much did he pay?<n> Input: X = X2-$10*2=60<n>Output: 60 is the total cost of the noodles. And 60*2=$<<60*2=60>>60<n>Then it costs 60/2=$<60/2=80>>80 to buy the noodles<n>So the average cost to feed two people is $160 a day. If someone buys $80 noodles and another $70 noodles at the same time, the total cost to the store is $240. Then each customer consumes $120. That's an average of $80/person.

The bank looks up his picture, then the ATM makes 1 $200 machine. The bank then prints a picture of the man's picture on each side of the $200 bills, and sends him his $200. Then the bank tells the guy that's all he needs, and the ATM prints his picture and sends it to him. How hard does this go? Answer:<n>Output: The bank prints 1, 2, or 3 machines before they print a picture and send a $200 man's picture.<n>Input: The ATM prints 1 machine every 5 minutes and does 1, 2, or 4 pictures each time without a problem.<n>Output: The $200 man can deposit 200 $20 bills each day, and the bank prints 2,000 $20 bills every 10 minutes.<n>So the answer for this question is 1,000.<n><n>Input: What can you do with 12 sticks of dynamite?

So he paid $12.00 for the 3.   Therefore $12.00 for 3 * 12.5= $35.  2.66 = $36.  2.66*12.5= $36.  3.  3 = $45.   Therefore, $45 for 3 * 12.<n>Output: $45*3 = $600.  In other words, Adam paid twice as much for 3.<n>Output: How much does $1.00 increase your earning?<n>Output: You have $1.00 more in your pocket compared to before.<n>Input: The cost of the nuts was $12.00. The cost of their two containers was $8.50.  So the net effect was $12.50 for the nuts * 3.  Therefore $12.50 for 3 * 12.  2.  2.  3.  = $15.  Therefore $15 = 4.<n>Input: 10,000 bananas cost $5.00. 1,000 bananas now cost $2.50.

The bananas have the same weight, but their new prices are twice as high as at the beginning.  How much will it cost you to buy one box of 10 boxes of bananas?<n>Output: The new price will be $1.00 per 10 boxes, but you'll have to buy 60 boxes to start.  Therefore $1.00*60 = $30.  Since $30 = $40, you'll gain $0.15.  So $30 * 60 = $60.  A box of bananas costs $60.20, but your previous price was $50.  Which gives

Choices:  A: south pacific B: sea world C: pacific ocean D: indian ocean E: gulf of mexico<n>Output:		  Choices: The most dangerous shark species is the hammerhead.  A hammerhead is larger than a great white shark and eats fish as well as other sharks.  A hammerhead that gets eaten by a great white shark is considered an apex predator.  A hammerhead shark will take on the prey that an ocean lion or a tiger shark will not eat. The best place to see a hammerhead shark is the northern Pacific coast.  The area of the northern Pacific where a hammerhead is present is the area called the northern Pacific.   The second most dangerous shark is the tiger shark. A tiger shark that gets eaten by a shark species called the great white shark is considered a sub-adirondack apex predator, meaning it is one of the most dangerous sharks. The most likely area to see a tiger shark is in the pacific or Indian oceans.  Sharks are found in several different ocean basins.  The top 3 most abundant shark species are the great white, hammerhead and tiger shark.   The 3rd most abundant shark is the whale shark.  The whale shark is similar to a great white shark in size but its dorsal fin is very close to the whale shark's snout.  The 4th most abundant shark is the spiny-finned whale shark.<n><n>Input: At a supermarket, how many different types of breads can you find in the bakery section? Output:  Choices:  A, B, C, D<n>Output:  A:  Bread, Rolls, Pumpernickel B:  Bread, Pumpernickel C:  Bread, Sesame D:  Bread, Whole Grain<n>Output: When you are shopping for bread, a rule of thumb is to go to the bread aisle last.  Bread makes up 1/3 of the grocery list.  Bread products cost $2.  Whole grains make up 1/3 of that list. Whole grains cost $3 per roll.  Whole grain products make up 4/6 of the grocery list.<n>The price you pay when buying whole grains is generally 1/3 as much as buying bread but 1/3 or more of the cost of bread.  A $1.40 loaf of bread may cost $2.60 but a $2 one may cost $6.  So the first few minutes of buying whole grains is a fraction of the time spent shopping for bread!<n>The price you pay for whole grains is equal to or less than $1.00 per

How many calories a day will she burn?<n>Input: 1,700 calories a day since 1 calorie is a calorie<n>Output 1,700/2=$<<1,700/2=280>>280<n>Then she burns 1,700/3=$<<1,700/(3^3)*3=$10>>10<n>So she burns 280/1=$<<280/(1*1)/3=$10>>10, so 3 calories a day<n>That means she can only expend 1,700 calories per day to give birth and still burn 280 calories. Thus she will burn 200 calories per month just to give birth<n>That means she will have to expend 100 calories per day more just to maintain her body weight.

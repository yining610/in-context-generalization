There were 8 people on the train and they boarded the train about 8 minutes before the station opened.  2 boys and 6 girls got off at the station about 8 minutes before the train arrives.   2 boys rode the train but did not get off.  The two boys got off and two girls got off as well.  About 15 minutes after the train arrives, one bus arrives.  The bus comes directly from the bus depot and no stop lights were needed there. After this, 5 other buses come with about 60 extra people.  4 girls got off the train at a stop where they met an hour later. The driver told them he had to take a break but the girls sat with him for the whole hour.   After 10 minutes the driver came back to the stop. 3 more girls got off the bus and took the walk to the station.  The driver told the girls to wait but the girls talked to the driver and told him they had to leave and that they needed to buy some food.  So they told the driver they would be back in an hour.  Within an hour, both buses had people get off the train and board the buses.  So the total time was 2+3*20+5 = 2hr and 1m15 minutes.   So the final answer is 2h15m\n\nInput: In an office, people are sent e-mails.  A number of e-mails are sent over the same time period.

{"text": "Increased knowledge = understanding of nature, appreciation of nature/environment; increased knowledge = increased interest in science; increased knowledge = changed views\n\nInput:An average person works for 6 hours and makes $3,200 a month.  The average person also owns a Mercedes Benz.  A person who earns less that $3,200 a year pays $150 in gasoline per year (this includes sales tax). Thus, in an economy in which gasoline prices were $3 per gallon, the average person who earns $3 million would pay $30,600 per year for gasoline.  (These are estimates, but are ballpark figures.)  On the other hand, if the gasoline price rose to $6 per gallon and a $3 million person earned the average monthly salary, the $300 extra would cost him $11,600 per year.  (Again, these are estimates, but are also ballpark numbers.)  So assuming the person uses two cars a year, an extra $300 per year could cost him $13,700. That is, at $6 gasoline the $300 per year would cost him $5,600. (These figures are averages, but do not count the purchase of two cars.)  At $3 gasoline the $300 per month would cost him $2,400, so $1,600.\n\nOutput:\n\nInput:John works at his company for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for $800 a week. $24,600 in pay equals $320,600 per year.

She has to fax paperwork to the company every time she takes a paycheck.  She also has to send out checks.  She has to give her boss copies, too.   Each time she sends out a check she has to hand deliver it to the banker's office.  She has to check her personal, work, and business accounts daily and make a quick decision as to whether or not to spend extra money.  On those days she has to write $200 out of her pay check and hand it over to the banker.  The banker will then write back $200 and issue her a check for it.\nOutput: Jane has to deposit $200 twice ($200 * $200 = 1000$) at the banks. She has to deposit another $200 every time she sends out a paycheck.  She has to use the check to make the deposit.  She has to write $200 from the check into her personal and business banking accounts.  She has to make a decision as to whether to spend extra money to pay for herself and make a check deposit or not.\nSo the final output would be $200 * $200=$1200$1050\nSo you would expect that at least one payment would be returned per day.  Therefore, it would cost $1200*60 = $1200 to make a deposit.  If the banker keeps $1 in his business account, he has $60 left over at the end of the day.  If the banker has $60 in his personal account, he has $600 left over at the end.  So the $1200 is worth more than $60.  In summary, the banker keeps $600 of all the money he has, so it is not as if the banker is loosing much money by keeping $1.  Therefore, the banker does not have to keep $1 per check.  Therefore, the bank keeps $2.\n\nInput: When Adam leaves the store to drive home to Florida, he has to buy food and other supplies at the gas station.

The poor eat rice mostly because they cannot afford other foods. In the past, the government used to buy rice for poor people in the city and sell it in the city for lower prices. The government would take the rice back and would provide food for free. The situation has changed since then. The government has decided not to provide food for free to poor people in the city. The government has decided to grow the rice itself in the mountains.  Most likely, the cost of rice is controlled to prevent people from starving to death. So the answer is No.\n\nInput:The Cost of a movie ticket is $10.00. The Ticketmaster.com website showed that the price of tickets dropped to $8.00.

We passed a downed tree that looked very large.  We carried it home, but it wasn't big enough to use as a bed.  We found a stump with pieces of wood in it.  We set the stump down and tried to sleep on the wood with our backs to it.  We spent quite a while trying to get comfortable on the wood before deciding it wasn't worth the trouble.  We took the wood home and set it in a tree stump bed on our property as a bed for the night.  We thought we had found quite a treasure, but it turns out that we had missed the mark.  We decided it wasn't worth all the trouble and we should just cut the wood off.  So, we left the wood stump bed on our property and removed the pieces of wood.  We then had to use the leftover pieces of wood to fill our beds.  The total cost of the wood stump bed was $2.13.  How much does taking a walk cost?\nOutput: The final figure is 2.13 = {2*2*2*2+2*2*50*50+2*50*50*50+1*50*50} = $35.75\nSo it costs 35*2=<<35*2=10>>10 minutes to walk to the house and find the stump bed and the stump\nBecause the cost was $15 per minute it costs 10*35*35=>50% of the cost of taking a walk to get there\nSo the final answer can be $5\n\nInput:\nWhen you're taking a walk, how many steps do you put in when you're done?

You contact your bank to try to get the money out.  What should you do?\nOutput: The safe is protected by a coded card reader.  The system uses a code that you must enter when you take the card out of the safe.  The card is locked until it is withdrawn by a staff member.  When a staff member extracts the card from the safe, a number flashes on the reader.  The staff member then enters this number into the computer and returns to his desk.  When the card is extracted from the safe, the process repeats itself.  When the codes are entered into the computer, the computer returns the card to the safe.  If you would have withdrawn the card to a different register from where you placed it in the safe, it would probably not have been removed.  If you have a safe with several locks, you may not be able to remove all the locks or lock one of the other locks at any one time.\nOutput: The card reader is set to a number that you must match to unlock the door.  This number appears on the reader when it has been inserted, and appears again when it is extracted.  When you extract the card, the reader also appears.  Each time these two items are activated, the computer will print a number in the mainframe screen that corresponds with the key number you have inputted.  If you have entered the correct code at the same time each time the card is extracted, then the computer has an alphanumeric match and the card is returned to the safe (receipt).  If you enter different alphanumeric codes each time the card is withdrawn, you have to reenter the same codes each time which slows you down.\n\nInput: You live in a one-bedroom apartment, and you are having trouble finding a good place to put a large cabinet.

{"text": "If there was one bathroom for a family and 20 rooms upstairs. How many bedrooms are there on the top level? Calculations:  B + D = 15+E = 34  The first 15 rooms are bedrooms with one bathroom, while the 20 rooms are bathrooms with one bedroom.  So in total 18 rooms.  So all rooms have 2 people. The numbers on the doors are the number of people who live at the house, so there are 54 people in total so 3 bathrooms for each of them is included.  2 beds are in each 3rd 3rd, so there are 27 total.  So 27 + 6 = 27  So the total rooms are 84  So all rooms are 4*284=8\nSo the final answer would be 44\n\nInput:The house has 10 rooms, but most people don't live there for the 10 rooms... how many guests do people usually have in the house at one time? Calculations:  10 + 3*284 = 42   The average person has 12 visitors at their house monthly.  So the average house has 43 guest rooms. The average guest stays 1.3 nights, which is less than what he would usually spend each month. So the average monthly guest spend would be 42/2=4.  So he would spend 8.38 days at the house per month, which is the amount of money he normally spends in house per month.  So the average total guest stays are 10*5=40 so the average total guests would total 50.  So in total he would spend 50/2=25 days in the house at a month.\nSo the final total guest nights are 50*2=28\nSo the final answer will be 28\n\nInput:The roof is made of plastic.

For example a1 means the child has 45 chores to do. For example a2 means he still has 45 chores. That means you might have to do it using the following equation a1 = b2 + c1 + d1 so a1 + b2 + c1 - d1 - a1 = a2. The first rule of this equation is that the same rule applies for both a2 and a1. The second rule is that a1 must satisfy b1 and c1 must satisfy d1. If you solve a1 = a2 and solve a2 = a1, you will see that there is no way to add them because the first rule of the equation is always satisfied and the second rule is never satisfied.

Answers:\nInput:1$1 per year2$10 per year3$100 per year4$2000 per year5$10000 per year\nOutput:B.C. D.E\nTherefore $200 *1$1=$160. If you grow both $160 *2=$240. If you grow C $120 / 2=$180.     Therefore 200 + 180=$240. That means his total cost per year goes up 200*2=$320. Now, the second question is      2 - 160 = 160. Let's say he grows a hundred bushels worth of corn and beans next year and raises the price to say 2$ per bushel.     160 * 2 = $1060.40 in other words $1200 per year. This year he will raise the price by $1000, then next year he will raise it again by $1200.

Jim takes the loan out for $1500, makes a payment every month and has paid off the car already.  Why does the cost go up every month?  Will it ever come down?\nAnswer: He did not agree to pay $1500 per month.  He agreed to $1500 after only three months.  He agreed to pay $1500 because he saw a discount for doing things his way.  There is a question for a low price, but he didn\u2019t answer it for some unknown reason.  He must have decided that his old car was a piece of crap.  He also agreed to pay the low price to be the guinea pig for the new test drive.  He also agreed that he was the guinea pig because he wanted to see the car.  The low price is also a lie because the test drive took place after the car was paid off.  So the answer is no.  He did not agree to the discount, he agreed to the new price.

The banana business cost $8 and the orange business cost $12.\nSo the banana business cost $30 and the orange business cost 20.\nSo the total banana business cost 30+20=$120=$60\nSo the total orange business cost 60+60=160=$140\nSo the total orange-banana business cost 160+80=$160.\nSo the total average banana cost 120=$240=$160.\nSo total average orange cost 120=$240, thus reducing the total by the 80% margin\nSince the banana business costs 60 less than the average orange business of 160, thus reducing the total cost by 20%, the total cost of bananas is $120=$240=$160\nThat makes the total cost of bananas $120=$160.\nSo he ends up with a total of $120/$160=$40.\nThat brings the total cost of bananas to $120=$240=$120\nSo the final answer for his problem is $48\n\nInput:Billy made coffee for $5.

After 24 months the same price per pound goes up 23.98. On what month does the price per pound drop? Why?\nOutput: When John bought the meat he bought 3 kilograms of fish and 2 kilograms of meat. Since the price per pound of meat went up 8.40, the price per pound of fish went down 4.94 as a result, even though the price of meat fell.\nOutput:The change in per pound price of fish is exactly what is needed to make up for the per pound price fall in meat. Therefore the total income would have doubled.\nOutput:For every pound of meat that you buy the price goes up in the beginning. If that pound is still there after 4 months, it is cheaper for you to sell it and buy another pound of food the day after.\nOutput:That meat price is what you buy after that first 4 months.

He accepted the offer after much hesitation and had $20,000 to contribute into the study.   The company has set up research stations at several locations to collect data on the effects of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine.  They will need volunteers to spend time at the stations with these substances, answer questions about the study, and record data.  John feels that he will miss out on being able to spend time with his family, but he accepts the job because he hopes that this could be a huge step forward in his research.   He feels that he will gain from the experience because of his background in mathematics and science and with an expert on their data they will be able to obtain valuable information.   They have already collected data about four of the volunteers, and will be recruiting the last two in the next six weeks.   He has applied for the third volunteer position and feels that he is up to the challenge.  They have paid $3500 already and John has decided to contribute $5,000 of his own money.

He has to spend his own time volunteering with them and make sure that he has adequate time in order to take his wife with.

He feels that it will give him a better understanding of the results of the study than if he wasn't in it.  He plans to set up three stations near his home in order to collect data at least twice a month and see the results after the six weeks are up.  If he feels successful, they will look at making the study open to the people in the U.S. instead of just allowing U.S. citizens to participate.  He also wants to make the study public.

He has also agreed to be available to answer questions at the stations for both the company and when he is volunteering.  As for his research assistant position,", "answer": "C: deafness"}

It seems that now it would be good to cover a personal finance topic, since many of the questions raised about business and finances are probably the same, but the way in which they are answered can vary slightly.\nSo let's look at the question \"Do You Know How to Use Your Credit Cards?\". It starts out as follows:\n\nThe first picture below is of your credit card statement. The second picture is of the statement after a particular transaction. (Both are shown on the left-hand side of the image). The third picture is a \"look up\" statement. These are statements which provide a record of how much you spent as well as your balance.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what credit cards are. Credit cards are just another item on your bill card. When shopping for groceries and buying food for the family, a check or bill is a more convenient way to go. Many people prefer to pay for a bill with a credit card instead of a check. It may seem that spending money with a credit card is more cost-efficient. Not necessarily.\n\nCredit cards also have an annual percentage rate based on what you owe. If your credit card balance is too high to go to 0%, you will have an interest rate based on the balance.", "answer": "B: wedding party"}

So each day he has to pay $80 in food for fruit. That means he will only eat 30 kilogram bags each of fruit. That amounts to $320 per day to get to his 300 pound goal.\nThat means the final value of the fruit and nut boxes is $320/30 = $120\nSo George paid the nut boxes $120 total = $120. Thats $120 less than what he paid for the fruit.\nThat leaves $120 less than what John paid for Adam\u2019s items\nThat\u2019s $120 less than John Smith paid for John Smith\u2019s items\nTherefore John paid $120 less than George for Adam\u2019", "answer": "D: big city"}

He is not hurt but his car is damaged. He spends $2000 repairing it. What is the best way to go about replacing his car?\nOutput: John needs to replace his car. He could replace it with four other cars each costing $1600 each. Or he could buy a new car with double the cost of any other car. So far, I am leaning towards the latter. But if there would be the ability to buy the new car with money he owes, he should buy the new car.\nOutput: When a car is given to somebody who owes money, the person who pays must pay it. So the person who owes money must get his car repaired. If his vehicle has been seriously damaged, he should call an auto shop that specializes in repair cars in his area and have it repaired.\nOutput: A judge cannot just throw someone\u2019s property out the window on the courthouse steps.

The probability is 1/24. How do I calculate the total yield to get the return in the table?\nOutput:\nSo how long did it take to sell the bond (36 months)?\nThen how much did you get at maturity (6% interest)?\nSo the yield of 6% divided by 36 is 10\nSo you get: 10%/(6+36)*36=5.53\nAnd so the return on the bond is 5.53/36 = 1.5 %\n\nHere is an example that uses some of the techniques that you saw above:\n\nInput: X is a 1.5x return on a bond with 10% and a maturity of 84 months. The yield is 2/4. How do I derive the distribution of the bond?\nOutput:\nThe yield of 2% divided by 84 is 4\nSo the net income from this bond is 48%\nSo the bond's return is 8%/84=4.4 / 3 or 5.9%\nAnd so the bond's return on average over time is 4%.\nSo the average yield is 5.9% (over the course of the entire investment)\nSo the average income distribution is 2/3.33/12 = 0.97\nAnd the median is 0.97\nSo the median is roughly 1% / 36 = 1.3\nSo if the median is lower than 0.97 that would be extremely unlikely (I assume this because the median is higher than 0.97 and lower than 1.3).\nInput: A price of X is $200.

Answer: The first term is the result of a combination of two variables.  The second term is the second variable. In algebra this is often referred to as conditional assignment: The first variable is the result of a simple conditional operation on the first variable.  The second variable is the second independent variable.   For example: The first variable is $100-$200 per week. The second variable is $200 per week.  Suppose for the sake of the example that the 2nd variable is equal to $200. That would equal: The first variable is 1, the second variable is 2.  That equals: The first variable is not equal to 2, the second variable is not equal to 1.  That then equals: The first variable must be 1, the second variable must not be 1.\n\nInput:How many of each gender can fit in a small room?\nOutput:How many of each sex can fit in a small square box?\n\nInput:Given the following information:The first time the person meets someone he is attracted to, she gives him a hand holding.

Input; what was the number of apples in the tree? Output: 3\nInput:What number is the tree? Input. What is it saying to us?

Now, I mean it's impossible to hit ALL 2 apples, but the possibility is still higher than zero.\nWith the number of apples, we can calculate the probability of hitting the other apples and I'll leave it at 99.9%.\n\nLet's say there were a tree full of apples. There would be a small chance that you may hit some apples and they would break off and fall into the ground. This results in you hitting one apple, the rest of apples go into the ground.\nSo the probability of hitting both apples is 1/2.\nNow, there is more than just 1 chance for something to happen, so if there are 6 apples and you are trying to hit only 3 of them, the odds are only 0.94%.\nIn my opinion, your average is still too low for the question", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}

Now, after owning the car for 6 years, he has driven it over 1,800 miles and the total cost is $3,800 and the value is $6,800.  What is his total fuel cost since buying the Mustang?  How much did he spend?  The answer: $2,800\nSo the total cost is $1,800 * 1,800 = $13,800 and the value to him is $6,800\nSo after owning the car for 5\u00bd years, his total fuel costs from the car are $1,800 * 5 = $9,500\nSo his total fuel costs from owning the car are $1\u20139,500 = $9,450 and his total cost from owning the car is $9,450*9,500 = $2,450.\nOutput: So far John has burned 2,280 miles of gas and the total cost is 4 \u2013 9 = $890\nHow", "answer": "E: office building"}

The doctor will be late.  How much is it going to cost her to get a driver\u2019s driver\u2019s license?\nOutput: Her current license expires in two months.  She has two options:  A: she must wait two months before applying for a new license B: she can renew her current license within two months.  If she renews her license within 2 months she may need to pay an extra renewal processing fee of $35.  If she renew her license after two months her fees will double.  So she will either wait two months or pay an extra $160 in renewal fees to renew her license.  Overall her current license costs $160 to renew.  So at this point she will have a license that costs $250 to renew.  Because she has been driving for over ten years if she gets a new license for two months she will pay a total of $320 to renew her current license.  So she will have a license with a per month price of $320.  The total cost of her license plus $120 to renew is $200.  This is $320/100=320\nSo $320 divided by 2 = 320\n\nInput: Tom has a new roof installed.  He had to use a contractor for the work.  He has a 3 year warranty on the newly installed roof.

{"text": "You put the paper in a box.  There are 6 boxes in the inventory.  The cost to fill one box is $4 and $2 to throw away each box.  This implies the profit is $9.50/box\nSo if you buy four boxes, give each a new home and let the box go to waste.  That implies the profit is $12/box.\nThis sounds reasonable to me\n\nLet's run a final example again.  James has to refill the plane twice a year.  He has three tanks of fuel.  How many gallons of fuel does he need to fill in these three months?\nOutput: For this example he needs the fuel to refill the plane once in 3 months.  Thus the fuel cost is $10.50.\nSo because the fuel cost is $8.50/box, and we assume the profit margin is $12/box, he profits $8.50/purchase\nThen we can work this one another way.  If the cost per gallon for fuel has gone up by 10%, then we need to sell 20% of the gallons needed to refill the plane to make the profit.  So lets divide the original profit by four.  That comes out to $4 for each gallon\nThen we see that if we get three tank refills at a cost of $6, we will need to sell two gallons at $20 each or one tank and refills at $10 each.  So we have a $4.50/3=<<20*3=60>>60 profit\nA little bit more algebra\nInput: $1000 divided by 36 = $50.\nOutput: $1200 divided by 36 = $240.\nOutput: $3600 divided by 36 = $560.\nOutput: 560 divided by 36 = $84.\nOutput: 84 divided by 36 = $480.\nOutput: The profit per purchase is $120.\nOutput: The product goes on sale for $120.\nOutput!\n\nInput: what if we did not have a warehouse and the only way to transport products (i.e. not on airplanes) was train?

If Dennis was buying the same house next year, how much would he have to spend?\nOutput: How much would he save compared to buying the same house this year?  $200 \u2013 ($50,000) = $40\nSo by buying this house, he saved $2400 compared to buying the house now.  Since he pays $2400 instead of $5000, his saving is $1600 per year instead of $1200 per year.\nSo by looking at the annual increase in the cost for houses, his saving is $3600 over the course of 12 months. And since he would have more income annually, his savings will be much greater than $3600 over that 12 month period.\nAnd for you, if you do the same research, your saving will be significantly greater than $3600 for a similar house in 2006. And you have the benefit of having $4200 in savings when you would be paying $4700 in mortgages. Because you don't have to deal with mortgage payments, you don't have to pay the credit card interest, the insurance on your car, the property taxes on your house, or the maintenance on your house.", "answer": "C: architect"}

The bill will be paid for $35 in cash.\nWith this information you can estimate what would be included in the bill and then figure out if you would pay it in cash.  So if you knew the amount of meat, dessert, and drink costs then you would do the same thing when you go to restaurant B.  Assuming the bill will stay the same you would pay $55 and then leave the restaurant for restaurant C.  You would take note of this bill when you first go to restaurant C as there may be no change when the bill is paid in cash.\nThe bill could be any amount you find to be appropriate for the meal.  A bill which would include food and drink would be $20.  A bill which included two desserts would be $20. The bill would be $50 if the amount of dessert exceeded two.  If you pay your bill in cash then this is irrelevant.\n\nInput: If you were traveling with a large group of people on an airplane you would want two seats if available.  You would also want an entertainment system if possible.  You would not need a business class ticket for this trip.

In economy class you will get the same number of seats.\nLet\u2019s assume that this aircraft carries around 200 passengers, which corresponds to 6 seats in economy and 2 seats in business class.  So the number of seats required is:\nSeat 1: 5 people in economy class.  2 seats in business class\nSeat 2: 1 person in economy class and 1 person in business class\n\nInput:What is the smallest number of people that an aircraft can carry?\nOutput: 3\nThe answer is three\n\nInput:The size of a football field is 1.5 times the diameter x 3.5 times the height\nOutput:The size of a normal football field", "answer": "E: present bill"}

Bill Clinton has often denounced the military government, but has shown willingness to help the people in Myanmar in its time of need.  Donald Trump and Warren Buffet may oppose the military government, but they have both shown leadership in their time of need.  This is a difficult decision to make and a decision that is important, but it should be thought of as a choice (not a requirement).\nOutput: Bill Gates is a philanthropist. Unlike Trump or Buffet, he has not yet called for the military government to change their ways, but his philanthropy may help aid those in need during these difficult times.   Donald Trump is an outspoken businessman who often expresses distaste for the war in Iraq. Unlike Obama, Trump\u2019s policies are often considered anti-Islamic.  These are tough decisions.

Your goal is to make sure that all the problems have multiple correct answers and you cannot go around.\nLet\u2019s say you start out with six different numbers.  The easiest way to work on this problem is to begin by looking at the answer you think is right when the first three numbers are on the screen.  You say for example that   the numbers at the top of the screen are the \u201c5\u201d numbers and that the numbers at the bottom, 2,4 and 7, are the other five numbers.\nThen you need to find the exact answer to figure out the first three numbers.

Now, you only need to find the question that is next to the answer you think is the answer and you can work your way from there.\nIn math it\u2019s easy to solve the question.  Because the numbers are right in front of you in straight line you can quickly find the answer.  In this case you just need to find the questions where both lines intersect.  If the line that is right under the number is white, you can find the answer.  If the line under the numbers is green, you can find the answers on the lines adjacent to the numbers that you\u2019ve marked with dots.\nThe numbers that are not right in front of you can be tricky.  Sometimes there are two adjacent numbers with the same numbers.  Also, sometimes you may not want to just find the next number.  What about another number?  You may not have any ideas what it might be.  When you come to the last two numbers, the last two numbers on each line will add up to the answer.

This is a great suggestion, though not one that your boss should hear about!\nIt has been said that time spent with the opposite sex is never wasted.  One of the benefits of having a man and a woman in your life is that you get to spend quality time together.  And why not?  That time gets multiplied by two, if not three or four.  That is just one example, there are probably many more that you could give.\nIn my experience, once we start taking time away from one another for a short time, we both quickly realize that we are not quite as fun as we once were.  And because of that, we immediately want more from each other.  That is when we usually start the relationship over.\nHowever, I have found that when we take time away from each other, we start to realize that we miss each other.  For instance, when I'm with someone and they get upset, I miss them.  It's not necessarily physical pain, but it is more emotional.  It makes me upset that they think or feel such as way.  That is when I want more.  When both of us get down on ourselves it makes it all the more challenging for us to get back to the place we were before, where we both feel good about ourselves and each other.

That means that the oil is supposed to last 90,000 miles (150,000 km).  After a thousand miles (1.6 km), you should be considering changing your oil every 15,500 miles (24,000 km).\nIf you change your oil every 5000, then the oil should last 10,000 miles, or 1,500 km.  However, if you change your oil every 150000 miles (24,000.5 km), then it could last up to 35,000 miles (56,000 km), and if you change your oil once every 10,000,000 miles, it could last 500,000 miles, or 2,200 km.  That makes all the difference, especially when a big drop in oil price is in your future.\nFor the sake of convenience, change your oil every 15000 miles to save money, and change it every 500000 miles to save the environment.\nIn a vacuum, you should change your oil every 15 000 to save money and every 50 000 miles to save the environment, but that is not the case.

Maybe I have a really difficult time trying to do something about it because we haven't bought the right equipment or there's just not enough money to do so.  If things aren't going too well I don't get that performance.  Maybe I work as hard as I can trying to fix things before they go too badly.  Maybe I know this is not good so I try to figure out how to get people to change and fix things without them changing first.  Whatever...  I could get all the performance I want and get nothing out of it without doing anything to earn it.\n\nInput:Two cars were parked in the same spot.

How much did he pay for the first 8 ounces and how much did he pay for another 8 ounces?\nOutput: For both 8 ounces he paid $120*8=1243>1243*90=$632.50\nThat means he paid $600+12 = $<<12\u00d760=240>>240 per pound\nSo the final answer for that question is 240*2=$<<480*2=560>>560\n\nInput:James and Mary have been dating for a year.

{"text": "A store is a natural choice of storage because it is a large place to store things.  This makes use of the fact that the value of one container is higher than its value in another container.  With that logic, it makes sense to choose shopping malls because they are also stores.  Using the other logic, it makes sense also to choose the aquarium because it is a small place and this gives us a convenient use.  These would also all be places that are close together.

That swings him to a much faster average swing time.  That is 10% more swing time.\nNow how many strokes does he take for the 30 second average swing time?  This is the number of strokes a professional tennis player takes between each ace.\nOutput:He takes 7.2*10 = 28.4 strokes per game\nSo for the average player a pro tennis player swings for over 30 strokes in 20 seconds.\n\nInput:Two pairs of identical scissors weigh 1 pound each.

The company paid $1.50 per passenger from Chicago with $1 going to the charity of choice of the passenger's choice for every flight.  Two years after the planes were introduced a passenger boarded the plane and announced he wanted his $1.50 back.

What will he use the other 50% for when he gets home from work? (Answer to part 1)\nOutput: On Tuesday James spends 100% of his time at home and 50% at work. So for Monday he spent 50% and on Tuesday he spent 100% at home and 50% on work.  He spent 100% of the time at home because he worked in the office on Tuesday.  Thus the total of the week on Tuesday was 1/2 and also half\nSo since the total spent Tuesday was 1/2 of the time for the week he spent 1/2 and half of the time at home = 2/2\nThus half the week for Jim was spent on two halfs (2/2) of the time, i.e. 1/2 and half\nThat makes it two/2 of the week, i.e. 2/2/2/2/\nAnd therefore one/2 of the week Jim spent on two halfs of work (1/2 and 1/2/2, i.e. $3.47)\nSo one/2 of the half of work is spent 1/2 and one quarter of the time on two halfs\nSo when he calculated his hourly wage of $75, he subtracted 1/2/1/2 from 7/2=2/2 to get $1.25 from which he took half to cover the 2/2 of his time on two halfs and his hourly wage of $.75. And he subtracted two/2 of the half to get $1.75/half and 2/2 of his half to cover the 1/2/1 of his time on one/2 of his half. That is, he spent $1.75/2/1/1/1/2 + $0.75/2/2/1/ 1/1/0.75 = $1.81/1/1/ 1/.75 = $2.51\nThat leaves him with $2.85 on one/2 of the days he spent 1/2/1, i.e. 9.5% of his time.\nHe", "answer": "C: late"}

If you hit a ball in the centre of the fairway, your goal is to make that next fairway.  You achieve this by hitting that ball as high as it can be hit with the least amount of force.  If you hit the next ball with more force than it needs, it falls to the other end of the fairway.\nIn a regular golf game, your goal is a par.  So you aim your ball for every green.  If you hit one green, you aim for every green in order to reach par.  If you hit two greens you aim for every green.  You try to hit every ball in the middle of the fairway so that you won\u2019t have to hit the middle of the fairways twice to get to par.\nSo in your game your goal is to hit shots as high as possible without hitting a ball on the green.  However if you hit the green you will have hit all of the holes.  So don\u2019t overshoot the green.  So the answer to the question is:   \"Adam and James both overshot a ball on the green.\"", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

When it left again at 9 it was green.  Which of the following is true of noon?\nOutput: At noon it had to have been yellow, since it had just left. So noon was yellow.\nNo it doesn't, because there is no \"that's red\" part.  It has a set amount of reds which is yellow + green, which is a different color from green + yellow, which is the same as white.\nThe sun went back white at 7. And came back again green at 9, so it had to have left again green. So 6 hours of yellow + 9 hours of green + 9 hours of yellow = 20 more hours of orange + 23 more hours of orange = the sun was green at 4\nThat's 4. But there is no \"that is orange\" part so orange can't explain it.  It stayed green the whole time\nSo 20 hours + 7 hours  = 23 hours\nSo it was orange in 5 hours\nAnd then it was green for the 7 hours before the next sunrise.  So 23 hours + 8 hours  = 32 hours\nSo it was green for 2 days which explains why the weather was bad.  After that it was orange for 3 more days because it was supposed to go to the east\nYou are wrong, it went to the east in 8.7\nSo the time was: 8.7 hour = 2 days = 3 days + 5 days = 5 days\nWhich is 32 hours + 5 (2 days + 3) days = 35 hours + 5 (2) days\nSo 35 hours instead of 5\nThat means it took 35 hours", "answer": "E: plantation"}

The economy creates more jobs than the economy consumes.  How does it work?\nOutput:Jobs require more people.  Therefore, our population grows to allow employment for fewer people.  The population grew faster than our jobs, so more jobs were created.\nThe population grew faster than jobs because we let in so many immigrants.  We allowed more people to immigrate and created an even larger population, which created more jobs.\nOutput:We have let in so many immigrants that it causes so many Americans to lose their jobs. And because so many Americans have lost their jobs we have let in more immigrants to keep job growth high\nOutput:We have so many immigrants that we are having an even bigger population than the jobs we are taking in.  Unfortunately, we are having such a big population that we are having a even faster growth rate than our jobs.  The result is an ever increasing population as more people immigrate.\nOutput:So many immigrants fill their jobs so quickly that many Americans leave and there are not enough jobs available for them to fill.  This means we have a population that is smaller than our jobs.\nOutput:So the fastest growing economic sector is immigrants.  By comparison the fastest growing economic sector was consumer goods.\nOutput:So our economy is growing because it takes so long to fill the jobs we are taking.\nOutput:So we have a population that continues to increase as immigrants continue to try to fill the jobs we take.\nOutput:We don\u2019t have to be happy with this outcome.  If we want our population to grow faster we might be able to do something about job growth.\nOutput:If we can get more immigrants to come to this country and fill the jobs we are sending abroad we can keep our population growing while we fill the jobs we are not taking.\nOutput:But it appears as if the immigration policies are not working in this country.  We know that if Canada was allowed to fill our jobs, our population would grow faster.  But unfortunately Canada is not allowed to fill many jobs in the U.S.\n\nIf you know the above information, you can guess the answer to the question \"Who came first?\"\n\nThe next three problems are about numbers.

This\nshouldn't cause too much concern though, since we have about a 30% down payment.\n30,000+40%=$360,000$. The other 40% can go towards investments and paying for an emergency.\nSo the total amount to begin with was $780, but with 40% of the income going towards\nhome buying expenses,  we have $480, so you said that 60% will go towards the family and the remaining will go towards paying debt and investments.   Now that we are closer to buying a house, what do you think we should do with the remainder?   The house is now worth $180,000, so that means that we have to get a $120,000 cash loan and then put the $60,000 left over into the 401k.

How many times does he have to refuel?\nOutput: He walks 10+50=<<100>>100meters back to his own car\nSo he has to refill 10 times\nSo the final answer would be 100\n\nSolution:First, let's take the answer for a test. That means it gives a 1,000\npoint number to get a 1 score. Let's take the answer for the answer\nfor the test. That means it is a 0,000 score to get a 0 score, as the\ntest gives a 0 score.\nThat means that by definition 100 points are 1.\n-5.5% to 1*100 -10.7% to 0*100 *100 = 0.\nSo 1 and 10 give a total 2 points.\nBut the 0*100 is an imaginary number, so it is less than 1. It\nshould subtract the number 2 to get 1. It should be more than 1, so the number 2 gives 5 points.\nLet's say it is more than 1, that would bring it to 8, so 8/10 is 0,\nsince we want it to be more than 1!\nIf we do that, we get 1/2, which would bring it to 0! So 1/2 points to go, or 7/2, so 7.5 to go, or 7 to go.\nSo the final score would be 0.\n0 or 1 is better or worse than 100 points, but it also gives a different\nscore, so we have to factor that into our score calculation. 0 or 1 gives 0%, while 100 gives 10%.\nSo the result is:\n0 + 10 = 0\n100 = 5%\n\n-*5% -10.7% -0.2% -0.5% -2% = 0\n0 or 1 gives no score\n100 gives", "answer": "C: torso"}

It is often measured as percent change each year over the Consumer Price Index, as well as the prices paid for everything that people buy in a year.  An inflation rate greater than 2.0 percent is considered healthy, as it indicates strong demand for the goods and services being purchased.\n\nThere are two simple rules that should be observed when comparing inflation rates between years.  The first rule applies if there is no change in the demand for the goods or services being purchased. If there is an increase in demand for a given good or service, inflation will increase as well. If supply and demand change but there is virtually no change in actual demand, then inflation will decrease.  The second rule applies when demand and supply continue to be stable. As the quantity of goods and services supplied increases or stays constant over time, inflation will decrease.\n\nThe chart above shows annual inflation rates over the last several years.

How much does she pay for the dust?\nOutput: If the DC\u2019s government built walls it would shield the city from the dust.  Instead, it builds casinos to make money.  The city could easily build a wall, but the money generated from the casinos doesn\u2019t pay their debt back.  They have to take more money from the casino\u2019s and government to pay back the debt.\nThe city loses money every year selling bonds.  In year 1 they have no money left to build a wall, but in year 2 they break even.  In year 3 they make $350 million and in year 4 they break even.\nAnd every year they draw in the money that was supposed to come from casinos.\nSo the final solution this year is -500\n\nInput: A $50 billion company in China that has been selling steel for decades just closed down.

{"text": "Choices: The most dangerous shark species is the hammerhead.  A hammerhead is larger than a great white shark and eats fish as well as other sharks.  A hammerhead that gets eaten by a great white shark is considered an apex predator.  A hammerhead shark will take on the prey that an ocean lion or a tiger shark will not eat. The best place to see a hammerhead shark is the northern Pacific coast.  The area of the northern Pacific where a hammerhead is present is the area called the northern Pacific.   The second most dangerous shark is the tiger shark. A tiger shark that gets eaten by a shark species called the great white shark is considered a sub-adirondack apex predator, meaning it is one of the most dangerous sharks. The most likely area to see a tiger shark is in the pacific or Indian oceans.  Sharks are found in several different ocean basins.  The top 3 most abundant shark species are the great white, hammerhead and tiger shark.   The 3rd most abundant shark is the whale shark.

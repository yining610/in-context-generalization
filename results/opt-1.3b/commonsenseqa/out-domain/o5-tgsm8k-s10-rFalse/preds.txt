By using some of today's essential enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and database technology, however, businesses can make an immediate and lasting impact on how their organization performs.<n>This two-day symposium, which will be held Friday and Saturday at the University of Utah Business School, brings together key business and ERP experts, leading ERP vendors, program managers, and system analysts. Topics will range from what ERP software is and how to choose one to the use of database technologies, such as Oracle Java ERP. More than 100 corporate managers, procurement, accounting, human resources, and other executives in manufacturing, energy and transportation, retail, education, and health care will explore the best strategies and solutions for managing and running their organizations.<n>This is the third year the conference has been held.

If a parent who did not buckle their child into a car seat was prosecuted, on average, the rate of death from any childhood injury went up by 26%.  Therefore, the following statement is true:  If 90% of the adults, and all of the children, were to wear seat belts, the rate of death for the children would be 51%.  What is the percentage and the rate of deaths of those who do not buckle?  You pick:  A, B, or C.

If one could keep all of those 50% away from any other persons, we would have the lowest rate of crime in the world.  If we could keep all of those nonviolent offenders away from other violent persons, we would have one of the best prison systems in the world.  We want to determine how such a thing could be possible, what would such an organization look like, how would it have money and personnel, and what would the cost be.  We can also determine the amount of prison staff based on how many offenders require prison incarceration.  Calculations: 15,000 crimes = 1 + 2,200 offenders = 4,400 persons.  We could need up to 100,000 persons in our prison system, assuming that offenders do not have criminal records.  For those who are incarcerated, what is the average length of their sentence?

There are only a hundred different possible things that could happen to the bat when it hits a ball (such as a hard ball, a fly ball, a home run, a game-winning home run, a bad catch, or a strikeout).  For every 1,000 different things that could happen to a bat when it hits a balls, there are 300,000 equally likely and equally unlikely things that could happen to me.  If I hit the ball with the bat and it goes flying through the air, the bat will have 3/4 of the force of a regular bat but it will still give an equal number of force to the ball that it hits.  For every 1,001 different other things that could happen to either of my objects, there are 300,001 equally possible and equally unlikely objects that could happen to me or mine. Suppose I hit the ball with a bat and it stays aloft. Then how many different objects could possibly happen that cause me or mine to fall?  We will count them one at a time. In doing so, I can calculate the percentage of the things that could possibly happen to me but that could possibly cause me to fall that are zero.  If there is no zero, then how many objects can possibly cause me to fall?<n>Output: 0<n><n>Input: You buy 50 chocolate bars, each weighing about 60 grams.

One of the rooms in the house (not your bedroom) has the highest rent in the area. It costs $400 a month to have the room rented out for the same amount. How much is your annual income?<n>Output: $150K<n><n>Input: The average person on average consumes 100,000 calories a day. To get that much you have to take the equivalent of a 10,000 calorie a day diet, 3 days a week, with exercise on the other days. Assuming that you consume about a half dozen meals a day (some of which won’t have energy), eating that many calories per day eats up your lunch allowance. To get that much from the same food it’d take 4-5 hours of cooking one meal on those days. But those are not working days, and those meals are better for you (especially if you exercise). Assuming that you exercise on those days as well, you should be able to consume a lot more calories than 100kcal a day, if you work just 2 hours at the gym. So, to get that much you’d need to lift weights and do exercise. Assuming that your diet is well-balanced, and exercises are done for at least 20 minutes every two hours, and that you follow the guidelines for a balanced diet it should be possible to eat around 80kcal. Note that if you’re very active, only lifting weights or doing any kind of activity for longer than 5 minutes each hour you’ll burn less calories, and if you’re sedentary you’ll burn more calories in those situations. So, in a nutshell, if you eat very well and exercise at least 5-6 hours per day the total calories you’ll consume will not exceed 60kcal/day. Using the numbers above, if you eat 100kcal a day in calories, and exercise for 2 hours 3 days per week you’ll consume 1,200kcal over your lifetime – so that works out to be about 4-5 times the recommended daily calorie intake. Using the previous figures of 10k a day being enough protein to meet daily requirements, the recommendation is that you should get at least a third of your daily calories from protein (that’s half your recommended daily sodium intake if you take a low-sodium diet). Assuming you get 1.4g/pound of muscle mass,

Choices:  A: fridge B: a classroom C: envelope D: medical chart E: sheet music<n>Output:		 _____ If I put a note on my fridge it would be a song, If I put one on a piece of paper it would be a melody. If I put one on my window it would be a melody, If I put one over my head it would be a song. But if I put one on my fridge it would only be a little tune. If I put one over the keypad it would just be that little ditty I sing along to as soon as I open the fridge. If I put one outside it would be something meaningful. If I put one at the bottom of the fridge it would not be meaningful. If I have to change one I can't put it on the fridge. The note might be on the bottom, but the melody doesn't seem too deep. So, the most likely place where I can put the note would be on a classroom floor. The melody could be in the left hand corner, but I don't think it's deep enough because it's just a single note. The melody could probably be on the sheet music right next to the door, so long as I put down the right-hand sheet music. But the left-hand sheet music should be put somewhere with an arrow pointing left, so I can't put the melody on it. I think I can place it in the middle, but I have to rearrange the sheet music. I can put it on a floor, but I think I have to remove the right-hand corner first. The melody might be on the whiteboard next to the right-hand corner, but I don' t think the melody is deep enough. I might put it on a whiteboard under the chalkboard, but I think the melody isn't deep enough. So I can't place it under the chalkboard. And if I put it under the chalkboard I can't put the note on the fridge, and the melody won't sound good and would probably sound boring. So I might put it on the fridge, but it would have to be below the fridge and I can't put it there. It won't sound good and wouldn't be meaningful at all. I might put it in front of a picture, but the melody would be underneath it. It won't sound like a melody and would make the picture even more boring. But, I think I can't put the fridge melody under the picture because of the chalkboard. I wonder what you think. I've added a note so I can listen to it while I type.<n>

If the average value over the whole league is 100 goals per side, the number of goals scored for Barcelona in the League of Nations should be 300, and the number of goals scored against them should be 200. I think they could have worded it differently.

An average adult consumes 600 calories while standing, walking, exercising, or doing other activities. In the past, it was thought that these averages meant the total calories consumed a week by an average human was about 5500, or about 15,500 calories. However researchers now believe these amounts may be low because normal people are more active than active adults. In this study, subjects were instructed to walk around a room 2–5 times a week for 30 minutes, without lifting their feet, for the first 10 weeks of the study, when they were told to take their daily calorie and activity counts on paper, and then to report how many calories and how many calories’ calories were burned. A group of researchers found that a person’s weight when measured at the beginning and the end of the study dropped by 2.33% per week. This effect was also repeated in a second study at the same time, but more than 50% of the subjects’ weights did not change. These findings indicated that people who were more active than usual were “eating less,” possibly because they were doing less physical activity.<n>Output: 6,000<n><n>Input: Every morning, Larry wakes up 45 minutes earlier than his wife, Dawn, and goes to the bathroom one hour earlier.

At the beginning of the season Joe was on the baseball team and was a left-handed batter. When he started hitting left-handed balls he was so good that pitchers made him switch to right-handed baseball; he has never been very good against left-handed pitching. His batting average was.250 in 632 plate appearances. This was only 13 above his career averages. Joey's hitting technique included striking out only 6% of the time. His batting statistics included a 7% walk rate and a 29% strikeout rate. He also struck the ball well in his right-handed baseball.  Joey was chosen to be on this team because of his ability to hit and his excellent defense. How can Joey be a good outfielder?<n>Input:<n><n>Output:Joey Gallo made the Texas Rangers All-Star team this year.  He has a hit in his first 13 plate appearances in the major leagues.  He was not expected to hit at a particularly high rate because of the way in which the pitcher was throwing him.  However, his first 13 plate appearances were all hits.  Joey also made it into the All-Star game as a pitcher, despite the fact that he was a left-handed pitcher.  His defense was excellent; he made more out than he played in.  He showed signs of improvement each game of the All-Star season, but he made little improvement as the season went on.  He has never advanced higher than All-Star.  He is certainly not an outfielder in the tradition of Willie Mays or Frank Robinson. Joe is a third baseman in the sense that he has a lower fielding percentage than a shortstop or second baseman.<n>Output:<n><n>Input:In a recent baseball game, Tom has six pinch runners.

Answer:<n><n>Output: This is a simple, and one of the most frequently asked, question from students.  Students are often not able to find out how much bodyweight they have gained, or to estimate how much weight they can gain in 12 months.  This is one of the most asked questions in college athletics, and here I am going to provide a possible solution.  I will also provide a sample answer to help students get a general handle on bodyweight.  If you are looking to add any new muscle, you should probably have a stronger diet.  You can also use the following formula to estimate the number of pounds that you can add on your current weight.<n><n>To estimate the number of ounces you will gain when you increase your bodyweight based on body type.  The first number to be added to the total bodyweight is the amount you weigh.  For example, for a person with a Body mass index of 12.5 and a height of 200 lbs, the body weight would be 24.75 pounds.  Then add an ounce to this total based on the height of 200 lbs.  This would increase your body weight by 1 ounce.  For instance: For a person with a BMI of 25, which is the average for average-sized college students, the average bodyweight would be 24.0 pounds.  Then add another 0.5 ounces to the total bodyweight based on size.  This would double your bodyweight.  Therefore, your total bodyweight would be 24-1.5=26.0 pounds.  For the remainder of this equation, which is based on body type, your bodyweight will be 24.5 pounds, your height will be 200 inches, and your age will be 20.   Since the total bodyweight is 26.0 pounds divided by 20, we get our bodyweight in ounces.  I hope this gave you a good glimpse into body weight. If you have any questions, I hope that this example answers your question.  Best of luck for your future!<n><n>

In Thanksgiving, students must choose an activity as their activity of the day and answer a multiple choice question. The goal is to get the most points possible!<n><n>I am always looking for ways that I can help students stay motivated to work in the classroom. In your students' cases, you may be concerned that they may feel they have nothing to be thankful for. So, what can you do? Here are some suggestions I have seen over the years that are effective in helping students be thankful and focused each day:<n><n>1. Place an offering of some sort for their morning's devotions<n><n>2. Read a story or scripture out of the Bible<n><n>3. Pray for help for your students<n><n>4. Tell them what a good teacher you are<n><n>5. Have them write down 10 things they are thankful for each day.<n><n>6. Thankful in the Bedroom. It's a great way to end your day as a family!<n><n>7. Read a story or passage from the Bible as a family before you go to bed.<n><n>8. In the Morning before Breakfast. Have students write the following list of things they are thankful for.<n><n>This exercise is not intended to be a strict answer to the questions above. However, they need to be a little bit of a starting point in order to get their mind working! They are asking a lot of questions here. Many more questions will follow during the Thanksgiving exercise!<n><n>Good luck on your Thanksgiving exercise! Let me know which questions you're asking!<n><n>**Remember we will be learning more from students in class this week!! So, let me know if you have any questions for your children in class today!

Congratulations!You can now go ahead and submit your activity, or create another question. Remember, you are only allowed to submit one activity per week during the school year.<n><n>- You are now ready to go to the next level! You must write a question. Be sure to read about each of the steps to writing a question here:<n><n>STEP 1: Identify your topic: Find a question that the teacher assigned you and you can have fun exploring.<n><n>STEP 2: Plan your question...and then answer it! Think about what is it that you want to learn while answering this question. Try to come up with a good, easy-to-answer question. Some good ideas: What is your main goal for your question (example, How do I plan to solve an equation, How do I organize and organize an assignment, or How do I make the best impression on my next employer)? What do I want to learn from answering the question? Who do I want to ask my question to? Once you have answered the question, try to think of ways to bring out the important parts of the question. For example, asking about an employee's day should not be filled with details of the person's job: Instead, the question should focus more on how he or she accomplishes important tasks at work. A person's major responsibilities should be discussed. An accountant's job should not be covered--he should provide explanations to how he/she allocates money. In all likelihood, your answer to this question will include at least this many sentences: The accountant... How? What? Why? Why? The accountant... My... Job... My... Life...<n><n>STEP 3: Organize Your Argument: The topic should be the focus of your questions. As a writer of essays, papers, and research essays, one of my favorite tasks when writing a question is organizing it. The order in which you plan to present your answer is very important, but you need to keep in mind some other rules: Your question shouldn't include anything that your teacher covered in class (such as vocabulary words or basic information). In fact, you should try to avoid repeating the answer of last week. Instead, your answer should include some new information, as well as what you think is important. In addition, what you learn from answering the question should influence the way you prepare your answer for the next week's question. For example,

The expression "(to) to" will be evaluated against the other possible variables for that expression.<n>Output:"To" does not have a default meaning.<n><n>input:"(to) To" is a special case "To" that is evaluated against the other possible values for the expression "(to) to". "To" values are also known as prefixes, and there are many kinds of prefixes.<n>Output:"To", "To", or "to" (also known as the "(to) function") can be used with any (to) variable; for example, it can be used with a variable of type int, long, double or any other type. It is also possible to use this "(to) function" with a double as a constructor parameter. However, there is no restriction as to how many times it can be used to evaluate a keyword, nor as to how many times its value can be used in the expression "(to) To". The same situation also holds for its value; in particular, in the expression "(to)" it is allowed to be used as many times as may be necessary while satisfying the statement condition for the expression "(to)" (the value is evaluated against the value of the keyword). In addition, the value "to" can be treated as any other pointer, even as long as it is assigned to a double.<n>Concretely, a value of the type "to" may be treated as a pointer to either the next item (a string), a string with a non-negative index (a numeric), or as if it were an array containing a pointer to an array (of double value only).<n>An important property of a value of the type "(to)" is that it can be evaluated as many times as may not otherwise be possible without making the result of an evaluation into a double. If the first condition is satisfied for the expression "(to)", an expression of type "(to)" can be evaluated as many as may be necessary. The expression "(to)" can be regarded as a special kind of "construction" (or "evaluation") of "const types", and thus it may be used with both "const" values in the expression "(to)", and with "const" values in other expressions. "To" also has a number of "special" properties; "To" has two distinct types of functions

If you make up a story, you are not cheating.<n>Good luck!<n><n>I found out that in my school they have a game called "I hate math" and it's a really bad one. It requires thinking, but it's pretty easy if you think about it.<n>I have a question though. Why did they make it a game about math instead of just making it something you have to do?<n><n>It's supposed to be a way of teaching math through the act of problem solving. If you could do basic calculus and trigonometry alone using your own resources you would have no reason to learn more math. This game is basically teaching you how to apply what you already know, as opposed to teaching you how to memorize facts (which can be learned through repetition and logic). I haven't studied as much physics as I want to this semester, yet my teacher is trying to make it out to be more complicated than necessary.<n><n>Because you're doing "basic calculus" and trigonometry, the fact that you need to do other stuff to get better at them is supposed to be a big help. In fact, that's how you might think of it. But, since this is a game of chance and math is the focus of chance-based games, it is possible that you are playing "less math" in this game than you are in other games.<n><n>The questions are all fairly easy to answer, but I will add one more: What if the two people scored exactly the same? Then, how do I know who was more likely to complete the game?<n><n>Because the same number counts as the same value twice, so each number is just one value that's worth more than the one before it, until you reach a finite limit.<n>The game tells you that, so you know:<n><n>That's the only way to know that you get more points for completing the game than the other person did, unless you find a way to cheat the game, I guess.<n>But, as a general rule of thumb, I would rather give a person 20 points for answering the questions correctly than giving them 0 points for guessing wrong. That's how the game gives you points: you need to guess the number correctly, or else it will show you that you have to guess "correctly" next.<n><n>Here's another problem with the game:<n>You are told to guess 7 points for each number you're

Answer:  Money tells you what the person doing the money has for you.  People care about money, if they don't have it, they don't care about you and vice versa. Money can change how you feel in situations like a crisis. If someone is in need of money, that person, or their family, has to make a tough choice.  They can get more money or they can eat. When someone receives that help, they start appreciating the amount of help they have received.<n>Output: 3<n><n>Example:  Bill wanted Bill to drive a truck and drive a route that would bring him $75 a week.

Would you have done the same thing?  Would you let anyone take your money and give it to a random person in need?<n>Output: 4.5<n><n>Example:  John came to school on a gray chilly day.  When he got there he couldn’t find his class.  He went to the class’s counselor hoping she might know where he could find his class.  The counselor said he couldn’t.

There are 4 people at the party: Bob's friend, Bob's buddy, Bob's buddy and Bob's buddy's wife.<n>During the festivities, there is a $20 tip on the table. Bob's buddy is going to pay $20 of that tip, so he can spend it on crack. The other 3 people will split the rest of the tip on food or drink. Bob's buddy is also giving $20 to the bartender to buy a pizza. At the door, Bob's buddy gives the bartender $2 in tips and a large drink.

He pays that can with his check. Then he goes back home to spend his $16 of Pepsi. He drives back to Olive Garden and makes out with his wife for $70. His buddy comes out of the bar with $20 in tips, so he gives the bartender 40 cents. At the door, his buddy gives Bob's wife $80. Total tips add up to $80.<n>It might be tempting to pay Bob's buddy $20 more than the customer, and that's fine. But if you do it to Bob, you'd probably be surprised what his reaction will be. You get a "wow, thanks" for 20% of the tip. That might be enough to convince him to leave a note on your car telling you to stay away from his wife, but it's not enough to get all his friends in on the deal. They might not get that much more than Bob, unless you give them several tips that are higher than $20.<n>Remember, if you can convince Bob's wife

If the other player has the ball, the player who scored the game winning goal gets it.  If both players have the ball, it’s who has the ball at time of score.  In this situation, it’s not possible for the opposing team to score any more goals.  What is the probability of a game win that way?

If the ball is a pass, and the last player who scored a goal has it and passes the ball, the teammate who scores the goal can kick it to the opposing player or take it from him and score.<n>Output: 1/2<n><n>Output: If the player who scores the game winning goal gets the ball, he can kick it in the air and shoot it.  Once it leaves the field, it doesn’t return.  It’s the same if the player who scores the goals has the ball, because it’s not a fair game (no one else scores).  If the player who scores goals gets the ball, he is only as good as his shots.  The best players in the world have average-to-bad shots.  If the player that scores a field goal gets the ball, the opposing team can’t score more goals.  The worst is average-to-not-so-good shots.  What’s the probability of the team that scores an equal number of goals but that one player scores 2?  For example, if both teams score 30, is there a 50% probability of one team scoring 45?  For example, since both teams have 30 points, is there a 50/50 chance the opposing team scores 30?  For example, can you multiply two numbers 1.5 times or three times?<n>Output: 1

You can make the money equivalent by weight.<n><n>There are two different choices.<n>1. If Adam bought 3 kilograms of almonds and two kilograms of dried fruits, he will get $12 and he will get $8<n>2. If John went to the gym 3 times per week and lifted weights for an hour, he will spend one hour each day warming up and doing cardio, and a third of his weight lifting time cooling down and doing cardio. So he'll get a total of 3 hours at the gym.<n><n>These two answers show that the problem is "to what extent can you estimate the number of hours people spend at the gym, on average"<n><n>1. This one is about how to estimate the number of hours. I think it is very important. In fact it is a really big problem. I think it is a critical problem in economics, because it deals with all the things we have to pay attention about and we have to estimate their cost.<n><n>If we know that John's total daily activity time is 3 hours, I would guess that he spend less time in the gym than Adam. But we don't know that, we just have some general idea about how much work John does per day, and compare this in different activities. This idea is called "cost of free time". I don't believe you can be completely sure that this is the case, because people have varying capacities, for physical activities (not just mental activities). Also, this idea is not very good. People spend time "unconsciously" in the gym. So I think it would not be a good assumption to make. If you want to really spend more time in the gym than you are spending right now, you simply have to do some serious physical activities like running, swimming, etc. This is like running an hour a day on a stationary bike. And this is more of a question about time as an object and physical activity. We will talk about the idea about the generalization of "free time" that some people will spend time in the gym than others, but I think that the idea of free time is not as simple as saying "John spends less time in the gym then Adam" It is something like "Adam is more relaxed than John". But this idea is not very useful because we don't know that John is "more relaxed

If the person lives in New York City they have to give him $100 of their money to help him get by. The town, with a population of 30,000, is a poor area, so there is nowhere to go.  There is one grocery store in a small rural town.  There is also no public transportation.  Adam wants to use the money he receives to get a new car, and he only wants to live in the town, so the town gives him $100 for the $50 he gets per month.  The man lives in the small town, but his hometown gives him $50 a week. The town, with an estimated population of 70,200, is a prosperous area.  It can only sustain two supermarkets.  There is a public bus service that is not strong enough to get Adam to see the nearby capital or larger cities, but he takes the bus. There is 1 gas station in the town, and when no cars are available, he takes the bus and waits in a line. The town can maintain two public libraries, and an additional one if needed.  It also has a community center, a public library, and a medical center.  There are enough jobs in the town for everyone to work.  The town allows two restaurants, and four bars, and one nightclub.  There is an elementary school, and a high school.  The town can support five private kindergartens. Adam cannot afford to go to any university.  He was born in the small town, and cannot afford to stay there for his whole life. He would like to move to another part of the country, and wants to continue to live in the small town that gives him $100 a month. He lives in the towns, where he lives comfortably, and it is a good life for him, even though he is not very well off, but he still lives well financially.  He cannot afford to live anywhere else due to his family's business. However, if he moves to the suburbs, the towns will still give him $100 a month, and he can pay off debt. His hometown has given him the $100 a month, so he is not a poor person, and in his new town he will continue to get the $100

The ratio of a player's playing time (on a team) relative to the playing time of the other four is.  The average playing time (on any given night) of the 4 players is about an hour and a half, giving the team about 60 minutes.  Thus if they play 12 hours out of the week, they would require 508 hours of playing time in each week.  What is the average playing time of team players, let's call them W.  Suppose they play a total of 80 hours each week. That means the average playing time of W is about 4 hours.  The average per game time of a team member is about 45 minutes per game.

The total salary budget of the team is $54.5 million which will have an expected draft budget of $65 million. Assuming a 2% salary, the total salary allocated for draft will be $45.5 million. If the draft budget is equal to the total salary (i.e. they don't pay any salary to fill positions, then we get $45.5/2%). We get $55 and then divide it in half and we get $55.25. Then we get the same result using a higher draft bid.<n>Output: 5<n><n>input: the total salary budget of each team this year is $54.5, and each team has a $45 million salary budget.

The same time span would take 3 days for a man to complete his usual daily tasks at home.  John eats 3 meals a day (two at home and one at the gym) at a caloric intake of 3,000 which equates to his weight.  This implies that John consumes roughly 15,000 calories every day.  If he exercised for two hours he burns one pound of fat every hour or approximately 60 minutes at a slow pace, and burns an additional 20 lbs of fat during each training session.  For two days in a row, he consumes an additional 1640 calories for a total weight of 24,080.  Based on these calculations, he burns an average of 3500 calories daily (30,000 calories a day minus 2,000 calories burned during exercise) and eats an average weight of 2420 pounds.  Based on this information, it can be assumed that John eats roughly 2.3 pounds of food each day.  John has a body mass index of 26 and an hour of daily activity is roughly equivalent to eating roughly 2,500 calories.<n><n>Input: The two players on the field for football each run 7.5 miles per week.  At a 6% grade school pace and 1 mph per mile, this is equivalent to a 1 mile run. When asked to run a mile, the speed is typically recorded at 13-14 mph.  A person’s metabolic rate (what a person burns each day) in 3% grade of aerobic activity equals about 2000 calories.  If each running mile is valued at 10 calories per kg of body weight, that person has burned about 1700 calories.  To consume 17000 calories would require a daily calorie intake of 32,000.  That would mean that John is eating roughly 2.6 pounds of food each day, or 2550 calories each day.  Based on these values, a person consuming roughly 2.6 pounds per day would burn an average of 3500-4000 calories per day.  Assuming the calories are distributed evenly over two days and averaged over a month, assuming a 5-pound body weight loss, John would burn an average of about 10,000 calories daily.<n><n>Input: A person weighs 150 pounds.  A person‘s calorie intake would be 600 pounds divided across two days.  If the number of calories in three meals is 1,000, then

Choices:  A: opera B: supermarket C: building D: conference E: apartment<n>Output:		 2<n><n>Click to expand...<n><n>* First, the player does the math in his head. He knows the total cost of the snacks he brought (2.5 kg nuts and 12 kg fruits for $12.00). He knows the total number of nuts and fruits that the other person bought (3kg nuts and 2.5 kg fruits for $8.00). He knows that it will cost him $8.00 to buy the nuts and fruits. He knows how many minutes the game will last and roughly how much total food he needs. Based on all these assumptions, he comes up with the answer: $8.00.<n>* He then goes to his fridge, opens the door, removes the required items as quickly as possible (2.5kg of nuts in the same 2.5kg plastic package takes about 5 seconds) and returns it as quickly as possible (3kg of nuts is $10 per kg and takes about 5 minutes).<n>* Finally, he adds up his purchases and buys a total of $5.16. He has enough cash for the food so now he can go upstairs.<n>* In his head, he has done this calculation twice using exact numbers. He has now learned to do these things using the money. In fact, now at the very top of the list is the food.<n>* He is now off to his office to collect his new snack.<n>* At work, things take a little while: he makes sure there are no wires hanging around inside of the office and unplugs everything from his computer. He then connects everything to the USB slot in the bottom of his desk and boots up his computer.<n><n>To get an idea of how much he needs to buy: we could take this step at the end of the game using the exact number or make a chart to compare (using the sum method instead of percentage):<n><n>The first calculation is the direct sum - i.e. how much the player needs to bring to the end of the game. It is the amount he needs to spend on the nuts and fruits.<n>*<n>*<n>*<n><n>The reason the direct sum isn't directly multiplied is that there are lots of subtleties and round-trips to make sure we have all the data as close to 1$ as possible. Let's assume that the player is really hungry or tired and gets 3,000 calories from the peanuts and fruits.<n>* We want to bring in another 3,000 calories because now he has

He tells his agent to make him a trade offer to a team in the top half of the league. The trade team wants 3 players and the player asks for one player in return. The agent asks for the number of players in the middle two. The trade offer is declined. Why?<n>Input:<n>* 3<n>* 1<n>* 3<n>Output: 2<n><n>Input:The first three games of a game are decided as follows:  1. a team scores two runs in the fifth inning. 2. the team scores two runs in one inning. The game ends 3-2. What happens next?<n>Output: 5<n><n>Input:This is one of the best ways to practice statistics.  It is simple and can be done for several teams.  One example is the league. All teams in the league are allowed 2.30 per inning. The value of this statistic is the average of the 1.90 for the game that did not score a run and the 5.70 for the game that did. There are a few ways to find these scores and calculate the mean. Below is an example for the Red Sox. The number of outs the game took is recorded as the average of the runs for both teams, plus the runs the game took. The value of the total offense for a game is determined as the average of the team that scored the most runs, and the team that scored the least. Each team is allowed to have 5 hits per inning, plus 3 outs. The total defense is determined as the average team out defense per inning. The average offense for a game is computed using the batting runs for the inning, and the defensive runs allowed. Each team is allowed 9 at bats.<n>Input: This is a simple and easy type of simulation. You select a team you want to analyze and you use the results to find the average number of runs needed to win the game. It could be that the batting runs of each inning were worth 2.80 per inning. But, the average defensive runs was worth 5.35 per

He sees an old man walking down the street very slowly.  James goes over to this man and asks him where he is going.  The old man responds by saying he is walking to the grocery store.  James says, "You shouldn't just walk with your old man, why don't you stop and talk to him?"  James says he knows that a stranger with a stranger shouldn't talk, but that man will get on his way and probably won't talk anyway.  The old man starts talking to James, saying, "I am tired of walking, I came here for good reasons.  So why don't you stop, take this, and then walk with me."  James walks by the stranger and goes back to his car.  He says, "You are a stranger, but you know, I do not go out to the grocery store in this area and then walk home with strangers - that would frighten people.  So, why don't we talk - you will get some exercise and so will I.  So, let's stop in the next store and go home."  The man takes James' directions and the two walk down the street together.  The two come to a McDonald's restaurant.  The man leans on James, saying, "How do you like my McDonald's?  It is good."  James says, "Yes, it tastes very good, and has very good nutrition."  The man asks, "Would you like a drink of water?"  James shakes his head and says, "No, I am all good."  The man says, "Well, then, it must be good for you, and since it tastes good for me, I like it.  So, you are telling me, you are telling me that a man with an old man who has been walking for a long time can walk right out to his car and take a drive and then get into his car and that I am a stranger, and I don't even have to shake your hand."<n>James says, "That is true

The total number of players is 1,000.  The total cost for tickets will be $75.  What is the probability of attendance by each of these players?<n>Output:  100<n><n>Output:<n>The number of goals scored in all of the games against Barca over the season by exactly two players in a campaign accounts for 20% of the total goals against Barca scored in the league that year.  If the players scored an even number of goals, this means they scored exactly one goal against Barca.  Note: if the players scored exactly 1 goal, the total number of goals will always be 2.  If the players are both scorers, their total number of goals also includes half a goal.  Note that the chance of one player scoring 30 against Barca each week is also 25%.<n>Output:  30<n><n>Input:The average number of goals scored per game for players in the top half of the goal distribution on average over a lifetime is 2.6.  Averaged over a year, that is the average goal-per-game amount is 4.9.  Given the number of players who scored 2.6 goals over their lifetime and 20 years of averaging the number goals players score over the life expectancy, that is the number of goals players are likely to score over the life expectancy of each one of them.  Since the number of goals players score over their life expectancy is 4.9, that is also the number of goals players who score exactly 2.6 over the last 20 years should score.  Note: if a player scored exactly 1 goal over their lifetime over the 20 years, that will also count as 1 goal and neither goal scored one week out of 20 and neither goal scored one year out of 20 will count as goals scored all over 20.  This is because those are just the week-to-week games players scored against Barca, and since the game against Barca is also a single-week game, the numbers are 1 week in all.<n>Output: 20<n><n>Input:How many goals does Ronaldo score per

However, some professions typically have more or less hours worked per year. A student is assigned to work in a college during the term of a degree program. Let’s assume that the student works an average of 5 hours per week for the semester. Assume that 20,000 courses are taught per semester and that 50% of them are full time. Then the average number of hours worked by a worker during a year is 6.0 hours. Let’s add up all the hours worked during a year and divide by the number of students. For example, if each student worked 6.0 hours during a year, then the average number of hours per student would be 18.2 hours. Divide the overall number by the whole number of students and find the total number of hours worked in a year by that year.<n>Output: 559<n><n>Input: Two passengers ride a train that leaves on time. When the train reaches its final destination, both passengers get off at the same point. Only one can be late for their train. A. the driver B. the conductor C. the conductor’s assistant D. the conductor himself<n>Output:<n>B. the conductor<n>C. the conductor's assistant<n>A. the driver<n><n>The question here, of course, is which one of the two is the driver. But, in fact, I want to look at the role of the conductor in this. The conductor is the one who tells the passengers how long the train is supposed to take. The conductor is the person who tells the conductor to keep his/her train running on time. Here’s the question again. Which one of the two is actually the conductor? Which one is the person who tells everyone to keep their train running on time? That answer comes down to the way we’re used to calling them in Western countries. In English, the word conductor is usually used in context with a train conductor, i.e., the person who directs the conductors of the various train conductors. In English, that word is used for a particular “driver.” If we think

Please do not include any information from your question here in your response to the instructor.<n><n>1.If Tom is to start drinking water again from his first week after his drink of soda, he's likely going to find it difficult to drink, but over time will be acclimated to his new habit.<n><n>2. If Tom starts drinking an equal amount of water each day, compared to what he drank before for the first time, then the number of pounds gained during his initial diet will be relatively similar to the number gained before for any subsequent time period.<n><n>3. If Tom starts drinking water to replace his soda intake, he may begin to lose weight in response to this pattern -- particularly if he is very dedicated to staying on his plan and is exercising appropriately.<n><n>4. If Tom's initial diet included a moderate amount of protein and a moderate amount of carbohydrate, then weight loss will initially begin in response to a simple change of pattern -- the same reason that people who change their diet for other reasons may experience weight loss as well.<n><n>5. If Tom's initial calorie deficit for a given time period was the same for him each day, then weight loss will continue to follow a similar pattern over time as his body adjusts to a new diet.<n><n>6. If Tom was to increase his protein and dietary fat intake respectively, his weight loss would be very similar to the number of pounds gained upon eating a diet with these changes.<n><n>7. If TOM was to take a break for a week, his weight loss would likely be somewhat slower than if he does not change his diet.<n><n>### Question:<n>1.

If everyone took 2 weeks holiday in 2000, and everyone lost their jobs, only 25% of all people would lose their jobs.

In September, it is expected that the can company will begin to build a new building which will add a capacity of 3 million cans per week. At first the cans produced will be sold to a distributor, but it is expected that by September the cans will be sold directly to consumers. The total annual capacity of both the can company and its new plant will be 42 million cans.  At 5 cans/minute, an hour of can making requires 1,000 hours (12 months) of working time.  The total yearly production cost is $3 million dollars.  At the current rate of can production, the can company will need to raise $1.5 million in the next 12 months to maintain its current cans production capacity.

Your answer also included the answer of the next question.<n><n>Answer each question to see your answers to the last question.<n><n>Example answers:Example 1:1) A banana costs $3 and a box of cereal costs $3.  Each of them has a weight of 60 grams. When Adam bought 3 kilograms of bananas and 3 kilograms of dried fruits, the entire cost came to $39.  Therefore, his total spend for the 3 kilograms of bananas was $12 ($12 + $5 - $10).2) A chicken wings has 4 pounds of meat and a pound of bird.  It would cost each of them $15 to buy the wings.  However, James had to get 4 gallons of chicken feed, and it costs $15 to feed him for a week.  Therefore, his spend on poultry is $40, and he would spend $16 for each of the 4 gallons chicken feed each week.3) James bought 5 boxes of doughnuts. Each box cost $1.50.  One box contains 8 doughnuts and one box contains 28 doughnuts. The cost is $3.00 ($3 + 3 + 1 + 28 = 4).  Accordingly, James would spend $9.00 each week on doughnuts.4) A horse weighs 1,000 pounds. You weigh him and use his weight to calculate the total you estimate he will pay for groceries if you decide to buy a package of the same size for that week.  What do you estimate the total cost will be if you buy a package of the above items?  Total Cost:$60<n><n>Example 2:<n><n>Input: An apple costs $1.49.  This does not include the costs of the packaging.  It does not include the fruit’s taxes, packaging fees, and taxes on a package of apples will be about the same as a package of donuts.  Therefore it costs $14.00 to buy apples.  What do you think you’ll spend on apples over the next week?<n>Output: $38.00<n><n>Input: If you want to buy a new toothbrush ($50), you have to start saving immediately. This could save you hundreds of dollars over your lifetime.  However, it requires you to plan ahead because you won’t be able to afford $50 worth of toothbrushes. Therefore, you have

The first is a simple question.  It asks who has more square footage.  The second question takes this square footage answer and places it on an "area."  The third question takes that area of the same value and converts it to miles.  These questions may seem complicated now, but to answer the first question, please answer this statement:  Tom has more square footage than anyone else in his house, and has more square footage than most in other houses also.  The second statement, about who is the "most square footage," asks you to find the number of families that fit into this statement.  How many of the families in the statement are larger than Tom?  The third question asks you to multiply the number you got in question 2.  The fourth question asks you about whether or not areas are square.  If you get an answer that reads "No," answer the next two questions.  In the second one, if you can figure out why the area of this area is 1,800 km, then answer "No" to question 3.<n><n>Input: Each time you buy a piece of fruit or a gram of dried fruit, the price of the fruit or dried fruit you bought is increased by about $1.

Total:.50<n>Average Family Budget - Your Household Expenses is an average family budget for a family of 5 living in the following areas, using the following information, which are considered typical, and which are likely to be included in this average household budget.<n>Average Family Budget - What is an average family budget? - An average family budget is, roughly, a budget of what your entire household takes in and what you make and save.    Each family, however, is unique and different so they may vary, for example, family member income may be higher or lower than family member expenses, perhaps the family has additional children and so on.  An average family budget, then, is a reasonable estimate of "what your entire family takes in and what you earn and save" at your current income level.  An average household budget is generally the median amount (between those two values) of everything your household is able to spend, including what is considered typical.  If your income is lower than you currently make you may choose to allocate some of this money to cover your current expenses with savings rather than to spend your remaining amount on a bigger savings account or perhaps spend the money on a larger vacation or other item or activity.  An average family may decide to spend less, however, since they may have some savings or have planned carefully.  Finally, if your income is significantly higher than your current earning level, you may decide to dedicate a portion of your income to spend at your higher earning level or to take some of this income and use it for living expenses with savings.<n>Average Family Budget:  What does an average family budget represent? - An average family, however, is not

What is the amount of money the poor African country of Cameroon will never see?<n>Output: $2,000,000<n><n>Output:Suppose there are 5 houses with two bathrooms.  Each house is $65,000 and costs no more than $11,000 to build.  If a group of people decide to share all of their rent money, and if they don't buy one bedroom, the cost will be $200.  That means that each person in the group is only paying rent for $11,000 a year.  If they all decide to buy a room in a house by themselves, the cost is $1,500 per month plus $1,500 for building the house.  Therefore, the total cost of the new house for the 5 families will be $22,000.  That means the total house cost is $22,000. If they buy a room in the house for their own use, they have no more than $11000 saved.  That's why people cannot afford a two-person room.  Suppose they need to each buy a car, but they also have a friend who owns a car, so they combine the car buying with their rent payment.  Then they only need to buy a

Are you sure it's not because you have some kind of disease?  After all, it's my longest marriage and we've never had any problems before.  How can it be a problem when I take two or three pills a day?".  The friend replied, "No, no, I am sure it's my fault.  Because we have only been married for 35 years, it must be all my fault".  The husband replied, "If it were just my erection, I would be taking four or five.  I know it's the hormones!"  The wife said, "I can tell by the blood rushing through my body that you are right.  I am bleeding quite a bit more than normal.  However, the bleeding only occurred when I was trying to perform oral sex.  I don't know how we got to that place."

The wife went to a nearby hospital.  The nurse checked out the husband and said, "You have AIDS.  Congratulations, you have AIDS!"

B: a wall C: a window D: not there E: all over F: all the trees<n>Input: If you could see through the windows in this room from the outside, the wall on the other<n>side of the room would be the same distance from the windows you could see in.  When you were<n>inside the room, what would be in your view?<n>Input: The table. B: a wall D: the windows E: a few chairs F: a couple of chairs G: a couple of<n>beds H. all over<n><n>Input: Imagine a small boat.  The mast is just at the ends, and the bowser is set in the center.  The<n>boat has about 15-foot draft.  The boat runs a current of water through the water.  The water runs<n>down through the mast and then around the bowser at the ends.  If you were to stand on the<n>bow, you would see the water, and the boat, at about the same location.  If you were standing<n>on the stern, you would see the boat, the water, and the mast, each at a slightly different<n>distance.  In fact, the bowser is so close to the boat, that if you were standing on the stern,<n>you would see a little bit of both.  You could see the bow as well as see a part of the boat.<n>Input: A boat of 15 feet draft and running about 20 mph (30 kph) requires about two gallons<n>of gasoline a mile (2.5 kms).  If the boat was travelling about 10 mph (16 kph) a gallon of<n>gas would be used.  If it were travelling at 1 mph we would only need a gallon of gasoline a<n>mile (2.5 km) so the fuel consumption would be 1 gallon per mile (4.3 kph).  There is no<n>refill option however in a gasoline powered boat so we need to supply the fuel from<n>an alternative source.  In the event that fuel was not available we could pump the water<n>out of the boat.<n>Output: 15 gallons per mile (24 kph) to 14

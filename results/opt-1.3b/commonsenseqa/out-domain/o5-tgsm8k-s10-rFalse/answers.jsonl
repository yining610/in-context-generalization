It costs $400 a month to have the room rented out for the same amount. How much is your annual income?\nOutput: $150K\n\nInput: The average person on average consumes 100,000 calories a day. To get that much you have to take the equivalent of a 10,000 calorie a day diet, 3 days a week, with exercise on the other days. Assuming that you consume about a half dozen meals a day (some of which won\u2019t have energy), eating that many calories per day eats up your lunch allowance. To get that much from the same food it\u2019d take 4-5 hours of cooking one meal on those days. But those are not working days, and those meals are better for you (especially if you exercise). Assuming that you exercise on those days as well, you should be able to consume a lot more calories than 100kcal a day, if you work just 2 hours at the gym. So, to get that much you\u2019d need to lift weights and do exercise. Assuming that your diet is well-balanced, and exercises are done for at least 20 minutes every two hours, and that you follow the guidelines for a balanced diet it should be possible to eat around 80kcal. Note that if you\u2019re very active, only lifting weights or doing any kind of activity for longer than 5 minutes each hour you\u2019ll burn less calories, and if you\u2019re sedentary you\u2019ll burn more calories in those situations. So, in a nutshell, if you eat very well and exercise at least 5-6 hours per day the total calories you\u2019ll consume will not exceed 60kcal/day. Using the numbers above, if you eat 100kcal a day in calories, and exercise for 2 hours 3 days per week you\u2019ll consume 1,200kcal over your lifetime \u2013 so that works out to be about 4-5 times the recommended daily calorie intake. Using the previous figures of 10k a day being enough protein to meet daily requirements, the recommendation is that you should get at least a third of your daily calories from protein (that\u2019s half your recommended daily sodium intake if you take a low-sodium diet). Assuming you get 1.4g/pound of muscle mass,", "answer": "B: not noticeable"}

If I put one on my window it would be a melody, If I put one over my head it would be a song. But if I put one on my fridge it would only be a little tune. If I put one over the keypad it would just be that little ditty I sing along to as soon as I open the fridge. If I put one outside it would be something meaningful. If I put one at the bottom of the fridge it would not be meaningful. If I have to change one I can't put it on the fridge. The note might be on the bottom, but the melody doesn't seem too deep. So, the most likely place where I can put the note would be on a classroom floor. The melody could be in the left hand corner, but I don't think it's deep enough because it's just a single note. The melody could probably be on the sheet music right next to the door, so long as I put down the right-hand sheet music. But the left-hand sheet music should be put somewhere with an arrow pointing left, so I can't put the melody on it. I think I can place it in the middle, but I have to rearrange the sheet music.

An average adult consumes 600 calories while standing, walking, exercising, or doing other activities. In the past, it was thought that these averages meant the total calories consumed a week by an average human was about 5500, or about 15,500 calories. However researchers now believe these amounts may be low because normal people are more active than active adults. In this study, subjects were instructed to walk around a room 2\u20135 times a week for 30 minutes, without lifting their feet, for the first 10 weeks of the study, when they were told to take their daily calorie and activity counts on paper, and then to report how many calories and how many calories\u2019 calories were burned.

When he started hitting left-handed balls he was so good that pitchers made him switch to right-handed baseball; he has never been very good against left-handed pitching. His batting average was.250 in 632 plate appearances. This was only 13 above his career averages. Joey's hitting technique included striking out only 6% of the time.

Answer:\n\nOutput: This is a simple, and one of the most frequently asked, question from students.  Students are often not able to find out how much bodyweight they have gained, or to estimate how much weight they can gain in 12 months.  This is one of the most asked questions in college athletics, and here I am going to provide a possible solution.  I will also provide a sample answer to help students get a general handle on bodyweight.  If you are looking to add any new muscle, you should probably have a stronger diet.  You can also use the following formula to estimate the number of pounds that you can add on your current weight.\n\nTo estimate the number of ounces you will gain when you increase your bodyweight based on body type.  The first number to be added to the total bodyweight is the amount you weigh.  For example, for a person with a Body mass index of 12.5 and a height of 200 lbs, the body weight would be 24.75 pounds.  Then add an ounce to this total based on the height of 200 lbs.  This would increase your body weight by 1 ounce.  For instance: For a person with a BMI of 25, which is the average for average-sized college students, the average bodyweight would be 24.0 pounds.  Then add another 0.5 ounces to the total bodyweight based on size.  This would double your bodyweight.  Therefore, your total bodyweight would be 24-1.5=26.0 pounds.  For the remainder of this equation, which is based on body type, your bodyweight will be 24.5 pounds, your height will be 200 inches, and your age will be 20.   Since the total bodyweight is 26.0 pounds divided by 20, we get our bodyweight in ounces.  I hope this gave you a good glimpse into body weight. If you have any questions, I hope that this example answers your question.  Best of luck for your future!", "answer": "E: gratitude"}

{"text": "A (5 points each) and D (5 points each)\n\nYou did well on this activity! Congratulations!You can now go ahead and submit your activity, or create another question. Remember, you are only allowed to submit one activity per week during the school year.\n\n- You are now ready to go to the next level! You must write a question. Be sure to read about each of the steps to writing a question here:\n\nSTEP 1: Identify your topic: Find a question that the teacher assigned you and you can have fun exploring.\n\nSTEP 2: Plan your question...and then answer it! Think about what is it that you want to learn while answering this question. Try to come up with a good, easy-to-answer question. Some good ideas: What is your main goal for your question (example, How do I plan to solve an equation, How do I organize and organize an assignment, or How do I make the best impression on my next employer)? What do I want to learn from answering the question? Who do I want to ask my question to? Once you have answered the question, try to think of ways to bring out the important parts of the question. For example, asking about an employee's day should not be filled with details of the person's job: Instead, the question should focus more on how he or she accomplishes important tasks at work. A person's major responsibilities should be discussed. An accountant's job should not be covered--he should provide explanations to how he/she allocates money. In all likelihood, your answer to this question will include at least this many sentences: The accountant... How? What? Why? Why? The accountant... My... Job... My... Life...\n\nSTEP 3: Organize Your Argument: The topic should be the focus of your questions. As a writer of essays, papers, and research essays, one of my favorite tasks when writing a question is organizing it. The order in which you plan to present your answer is very important, but you need to keep in mind some other rules: Your question shouldn't include anything that your teacher covered in class (such as vocabulary words or basic information). In fact, you should try to avoid repeating the answer of last week. Instead, your answer should include some new information, as well as what you think is important. In addition, what you learn from answering the question should influence the way you prepare your answer for the next week's question. For example,", "answer": "C: care for children"}

The expression \"(to) to\" will be evaluated against the other possible variables for that expression.\nOutput:\"To\" does not have a default meaning.\n\ninput:\"(to) To\" is a special case \"To\" that is evaluated against the other possible values for the expression \"(to) to\". \"To\" values are also known as prefixes, and there are many kinds of prefixes.\nOutput:\"To\", \"To\", or \"to\" (also known as the \"(to) function\") can be used with any (to) variable; for example, it can be used with a variable of type int, long, double or any other type. It is also possible to use this \"(to) function\" with a double as a constructor parameter. However, there is no restriction as to how many times it can be used to evaluate a keyword, nor as to how many times its value can be used in the expression \"(to) To\". The same situation also holds for its value; in particular, in the expression \"(to)\" it is allowed to be used as many times as may be necessary while satisfying the statement condition for the expression \"(to)\" (the value is evaluated against the value of the keyword). In addition, the value \"to\" can be treated as any other pointer, even as long as it is assigned to a double.\nConcretely, a value of the type \"to\" may be treated as a pointer to either the next item (a string), a string with a non-negative index (a numeric), or as if it were an array containing a pointer to an array (of double value only).\nAn important property of a value of the type \"(to)\" is that it can be evaluated as many times as may not otherwise be possible without making the result of an evaluation into a double. If the first condition is satisfied for the expression \"(to)\", an expression of type \"(to)\" can be evaluated as many as may be necessary. The expression \"(to)\" can be regarded as a special kind of \"construction\" (or \"evaluation\") of \"const types\", and thus it may be used with both \"const\" values in the expression \"(to)\", and with \"const\" values in other expressions. \"To\" also has a number of \"special\" properties; \"To\" has two distinct types of functions", "answer": "D: female"}

This person would, however, earn an extra $60,200 on the house if he rents it out instead of buying it outright.  The difference is the seller paid $60,600 for the house and the buyer paid $60,200 to the bank.

{"text": "A\n\nThe answer to the second question is b. If you make up a story, you are not cheating.\nGood luck!\n\nI found out that in my school they have a game called \"I hate math\" and it's a really bad one. It requires thinking, but it's pretty easy if you think about it.\nI have a question though. Why did they make it a game about math instead of just making it something you have to do?\n\nIt's supposed to be a way of teaching math through the act of problem solving. If you could do basic calculus and trigonometry alone using your own resources you would have no reason to learn more math. This game is basically teaching you how to apply what you already know, as opposed to teaching you how to memorize facts (which can be learned through repetition and logic). I haven't studied as much physics as I want to this semester, yet my teacher is trying to make it out to be more complicated than necessary.\n\nBecause you're doing \"basic calculus\" and trigonometry, the fact that you need to do other stuff to get better at them is supposed to be a big help. In fact, that's how you might think of it. But, since this is a game of chance and math is the focus of chance-based games, it is possible that you are playing \"less math\" in this game than you are in other games.\n\nThe questions are all fairly easy to answer, but I will add one more: What if the two people scored exactly the same? Then, how do I know who was more likely to complete the game?\n\nBecause the same number counts as the same value twice, so each number is just one value that's worth more than the one before it, until you reach a finite limit.\nThe game tells you that, so you know:\n\nThat's the only way to know that you get more points for completing the game than the other person did, unless you find a way to cheat the game, I guess.\nBut, as a general rule of thumb, I would rather give a person 20 points for answering the questions correctly than giving them 0 points for guessing wrong. That's how the game gives you points: you need to guess the number correctly, or else it will show you that you have to guess \"correctly\" next.\n\nHere's another problem with the game:\nYou are told to guess 7 points for each number you're", "answer": "C: laughing"}

{"text": "80\n\nLoading...Please wait...\n\nSolution Preview\n\n1.1 - Each person bought only two kilogram of nuts and two kilogram of dried fruit. You can make the money equivalent by weight.\n\nThere are two different choices.\n1. If Adam bought 3 kilograms of almonds and two kilograms of dried fruits, he will get $12 and he will get $8\n2. If John went to the gym 3 times per week and lifted weights for an hour, he will spend one hour each day warming up and doing cardio, and a third of his weight lifting time cooling down and doing cardio. So he'll get a total of 3 hours at the gym.\n\nThese two answers show that the problem is \"to what extent can you estimate the number of hours people spend at the gym, on average\"\n\n1. This one is about how to estimate the number of hours. I think it is very important. In fact it is a really big problem. I think it is a critical problem in economics, because it deals with all the things we have to pay attention about and we have to estimate their cost.\n\nIf we know that John's total daily activity time is 3 hours, I would guess that he spend less time in the gym than Adam. But we don't know that, we just have some general idea about how much work John does per day, and compare this in different activities. This idea is called \"cost of free time\". I don't believe you can be completely sure that this is the case, because people have varying capacities, for physical activities (not just mental activities). Also, this idea is not very good. People spend time \"unconsciously\" in the gym. So I think it would not be a good assumption to make. If you want to really spend more time in the gym than you are spending right now, you simply have to do some serious physical activities like running, swimming, etc. This is like running an hour a day on a stationary bike. And this is more of a question about time as an object and physical activity. We will talk about the idea about the generalization of \"free time\" that some people will spend time in the gym than others, but I think that the idea of free time is not as simple as saying \"John spends less time in the gym then Adam\" It is something like \"Adam is more relaxed than John\". But this idea is not very useful because we don't know that John is \"more relaxed", "answer": "D: study"}

If the person lives in New York City they have to give him $100 of their money to help him get by. The town, with a population of 30,000, is a poor area, so there is nowhere to go.  There is one grocery store in a small rural town.  There is also no public transportation.  Adam wants to use the money he receives to get a new car, and he only wants to live in the town, so the town gives him $100 for the $50 he gets per month.  The man lives in the small town, but his hometown gives him $50 a week. The town, with an estimated population of 70,200, is a prosperous area.  It can only sustain two supermarkets.  There is a public bus service that is not strong enough to get Adam to see the nearby capital or larger cities, but he takes the bus. There is 1 gas station in the town, and when no cars are available, he takes the bus and waits in a line. The town can maintain two public libraries, and an additional one if needed.  It also has a community center, a public library, and a medical center.  There are enough jobs in the town for everyone to work.  The town allows two restaurants, and four bars, and one nightclub.  There is an elementary school, and a high school.  The town can support five private kindergartens. Adam cannot afford to go to any university.  He was born in the small town, and cannot afford to stay there for his whole life. He would like to move to another part of the country, and wants to continue to live in the small town that gives him $100 a month. He lives in the towns, where he lives comfortably, and it is a good life for him, even though he is not very well off, but he still lives well financially.  He cannot afford to live anywhere else due to his family's business. However, if he moves to the suburbs, the towns will still give him $100 a month, and he can pay off debt. His hometown has given him the $100 a month, so he is not a poor person, and in his new town he will continue to get the $100", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

{"text": "7\n\nInput: John spends one hour lifting weights 3 times a week in his gym.  That\u2019s about 24 hours.  The same time span would take 3 days for a man to complete his usual daily tasks at home.  John eats 3 meals a day (two at home and one at the gym) at a caloric intake of 3,000 which equates to his weight.  This implies that John consumes roughly 15,000 calories every day.  If he exercised for two hours he burns one pound of fat every hour or approximately 60 minutes at a slow pace, and burns an additional 20 lbs of fat during each training session.  For two days in a row, he consumes an additional 1640 calories for a total weight of 24,080.  Based on these calculations, he burns an average of 3500 calories daily (30,000 calories a day minus 2,000 calories burned during exercise) and eats an average weight of 2420 pounds.  Based on this information, it can be assumed that John eats roughly 2.3 pounds of food each day.  John has a body mass index of 26 and an hour of daily activity is roughly equivalent to eating roughly 2,500 calories.\n\nInput: The two players on the field for football each run 7.5 miles per week.  At a 6% grade school pace and 1 mph per mile, this is equivalent to a 1 mile run. When asked to run a mile, the speed is typically recorded at 13-14 mph.  A person\u2019s metabolic rate (what a person burns each day) in 3% grade of aerobic activity equals about 2000 calories.  If each running mile is valued at 10 calories per kg of body weight, that person has burned about 1700 calories.  To consume 17000 calories would require a daily calorie intake of 32,000.  That would mean that John is eating roughly 2.6 pounds of food each day, or 2550 calories each day.  Based on these values, a person consuming roughly 2.6 pounds per day would burn an average of 3500-4000 calories per day.  Assuming the calories are distributed evenly over two days and averaged over a month, assuming a 5-pound body weight loss, John would burn an average of about 10,000 calories daily.\n\nInput: A person weighs 150 pounds.

If both sides score six more goals, divide the total number of goals by 20, and add the amount of goals scored by the visitors team. The visitors team did not score more goals during the entire match than the home team.  Calculate the number of goals scored.\nOutput: 100\n(The visitors did not score more goals, divide the number of goals scored by 20.)\n(Total number of goals - number of goals scored by visitors) divided by 20 is 100 divided by two or twenty, in which case (a) it is six and (b) it is 6 divided by 20.\nThe total number of goals is 6 divided by 20 - the number of goals scored - by each team, divided by two - the number of goals that both teams scored during the entire match (the visitors did not score more than the home team did).\nThe visitors did not score any more goals than the home team. So, the number of goals scored is 6 divided by 20, two divided by sixteen - the number of goals the visitors team scored during the entire match.\nThe home team did not score more than four goals. So, the home team scored 12 goals.\nThe total number to which the visitors team scored is 12 divided by 16, two divided by sixteen. So, the total number is twelve divided by sixteen.\nThe total number where the visitors team scored less than the home team is 12 divided by 16.

The game ends 3-2. What happens next?\nOutput: 5\n\nInput:This is one of the best ways to practice statistics.  It is simple and can be done for several teams.  One example is the league. All teams in the league are allowed 2.30 per inning. The value of this statistic is the average of the 1.90 for the game that did not score a run and the 5.70 for the game that did. There are a few ways to find these scores and calculate the mean. Below is an example for the Red Sox. The number of outs the game took is recorded as the average of the runs for both teams, plus the runs the game took. The value of the total offense for a game is determined as the average of the team that scored the most runs, and the team that scored the least. Each team is allowed to have 5 hits per inning, plus 3 outs. The total defense is determined as the average team out defense per inning. The average offense for a game is computed using the batting runs for the inning, and the defensive runs allowed. Each team is allowed 9 at bats.\nInput: This is a simple and easy type of simulation. You select a team you want to analyze and you use the results to find the average number of runs needed to win the game. It could be that the batting runs of each inning were worth 2.80 per inning. But, the average defensive runs was worth 5.35 per", "answer": "D: vegetable"}

This is how many total games he started:\n2000-00: 2\n2001-02: 4\n2002-03: 5\n\nInput:In order to calculate Tom C's participation, it is useful first to identify a number that is not too hard:  Number of games played = Number of games started. Let's try to find that in 2000-01, Number of games played was:\n2000-01: 4 games, total of 48 (22 start)\n2001-02: 8 games\n2002-03: 4 games\n\nInput: Let's say that TOM CR's total participation in college soccer was:\n2000-00 = 10 games\n2001-02 = 14 games\n2002-03 = 8 games\n\nInput: So if he played 60 games over a two year period, his total participation would be:\n2000-01 = 120 games = 2 seasons\n2001-02 = 120 games = 2/3 seasons\n2002-03 = 120 games = 2 full seasons\n\nInput: Let me look at TOM CR's total games played in college soccer.  2000-01 would be: 1/3 of a season. 2001-02 would be: 2/3 of a season and 2002-03 would be 2/3 of a full season.  How many games did TOM CR play in college soccer? (1/3/2/3)\n\nOutput: 2/3 in 2000 and 2 full seasons in 2002 and 2003\n\nInput: Let say that TOME CR has played 120 games in college soccer.  If he has played 120 games over two seasons, this means that he played a total of:\n2000-01 + 2001-02 + 2002-03 = 480 games total\n\nInput: Let us divide these 480 games by 60 = 600. Multiply this by 60 to get 60 games for each season:\n2000-01 - 20 games = 360\n2001-02 - 20 games - 36\n2002 - 18 games = 360\n\nOutput: 60 games / (60 x 60) = 360\n\nInterpretation:\nNumber of games played (20 + 60) for last 2 seasons is equal to 400.\nNumber of games played for college soccer years is equal to 1280.\n\nInput: The total", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

Then the average number of hours worked by a worker during a year is 6.0 hours. Let\u2019s add up all the hours worked during a year and divide by the number of students. For example, if each student worked 6.0 hours during a year, then the average number of hours per student would be 18.2 hours.

Please do not include any information from your question here in your response to the instructor.\n\n1.If Tom is to start drinking water again from his first week after his drink of soda, he's likely going to find it difficult to drink, but over time will be acclimated to his new habit.\n\n2. If Tom starts drinking an equal amount of water each day, compared to what he drank before for the first time, then the number of pounds gained during his initial diet will be relatively similar to the number gained before for any subsequent time period.\n\n3. If Tom starts drinking water to replace his soda intake, he may begin to lose weight in response to this pattern -- particularly if he is very dedicated to staying on his plan and is exercising appropriately.\n\n4. If Tom's initial diet included a moderate amount of protein and a moderate amount of carbohydrate, then weight loss will initially begin in response to a simple change of pattern -- the same reason that people who change their diet for other reasons may experience weight loss as well.\n\n5. If Tom's initial calorie deficit for a given time period was the same for him each day, then weight loss will continue to follow a similar pattern over time as his body adjusts to a new diet.\n\n6. If Tom was to increase his protein and dietary fat intake respectively, his weight loss would be very similar to the number of pounds gained upon eating a diet with these changes.\n\n7. If TOM was to take a break for a week, his weight loss would likely be somewhat slower than if he does not change his diet.\n\n### Question:\n1.

Your answer also included the answer of the next question.\n\nAnswer each question to see your answers to the last question.\n\nExample answers:Example 1:1) A banana costs $3 and a box of cereal costs $3.  Each of them has a weight of 60 grams. When Adam bought 3 kilograms of bananas and 3 kilograms of dried fruits, the entire cost came to $39.  Therefore, his total spend for the 3 kilograms of bananas was $12 ($12 + $5 - $10).2) A chicken wings has 4 pounds of meat and a pound of bird.  It would cost each of them $15 to buy the wings.  However, James had to get 4 gallons of chicken feed, and it costs $15 to feed him for a week.  Therefore, his spend on poultry is $40, and he would spend $16 for each of the 4 gallons chicken feed each week.3) James bought 5 boxes of doughnuts. Each box cost $1.50.  One box contains 8 doughnuts and one box contains 28 doughnuts. The cost is $3.00 ($3 + 3 + 1 + 28 = 4).  Accordingly, James would spend $9.00 each week on doughnuts.4) A horse weighs 1,000 pounds. You weigh him and use his weight to calculate the total you estimate he will pay for groceries if you decide to buy a package of the same size for that week.  What do you estimate the total cost will be if you buy a package of the above items?  Total Cost:$60\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: An apple costs $1.49.  This does not include the costs of the packaging.  It does not include the fruit\u2019s taxes, packaging fees, and taxes on a package of apples will be about the same as a package of donuts.  Therefore it costs $14.00 to buy apples.  What do you think you\u2019ll spend on apples over the next week?\nOutput: $38.00\n\nInput: If you want to buy a new toothbrush ($50), you have to start saving immediately.

Each family, however, is unique and different so they may vary, for example, family member income may be higher or lower than family member expenses, perhaps the family has additional children and so on.  An average family budget, then, is a reasonable estimate of \"what your entire family takes in and what you earn and save\" at your current income level.  An average household budget is generally the median amount (between those two values) of everything your household is able to spend, including what is considered typical.  If your income is lower than you currently make you may choose to allocate some of this money to cover your current expenses with savings rather than to spend your remaining amount on a bigger savings account or perhaps spend the money on a larger vacation or other item or activity.  An average family may decide to spend less, however, since they may have some savings or have planned carefully.  Finally, if your income is significantly higher than your current earning level, you may decide to dedicate a portion of your income to spend at your higher earning level or to take some of this income and use it for living expenses with savings.\nAverage Family Budget:  What does an average family budget represent? - An average family, however, is not", "answer": "A: drink tea"}

If you pick one player to play you must have a partner to play against.  If you choose to play against 2 players, you need 2 partners to play against.  After your 2 partners, you must play against 1 player who's not a partner of either you or one of your partners.

Each house is $65,000 and costs no more than $11,000 to build.  If a group of people decide to share all of their rent money, and if they don't buy one bedroom, the cost will be $200.

If they all decide to buy a room in a house by themselves, the cost is $1,500 per month plus $1,500 for building the house.  Therefore, the total cost of the new house for the 5 families will be $22,000.  That means the total house cost is $22,000.

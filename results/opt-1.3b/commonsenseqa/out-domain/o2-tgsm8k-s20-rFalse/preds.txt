After all he bought them for five dollars, not five cents!"<n><n>The cost of getting fresh strawberries from outside will be a lot higher. However Tappy bought them for twenty dollars not five cents a piece.<n><n>1. The cost of getting fresh strawberries in is far higher than getting fresh strawberries inside. Thus Tappy can only buy a few strawberries.<n>2. Tappy has more money than he will ever need. He buys lots of fruit at the farmers' market.<n>3. There is a very small probability that Tappy will get the exact amount of strawberries he needs. Since he's not sure of the exact amount he will need of a certain fruit, he'll buy lots of smaller amounts to account for the possibility of any one amount of strawberries spoiling.<n>4. If we assume Tappy doesn't know exactly how many strawberries he'll need, the total cost (the average cost) of getting fresh strawberries from the market will be lower than if we assume that's where Tappy will buy the strawberries.<n><n>The point is that we can't assume Tappy is buying strawberries at the farmers' market, so he can't assume (and hence he can't explain) what he's spending all that money on. The best we can say is that all the fruit he bought at the farmers' market is going to spoil, so you probably want to put him in the "don't make the

If you're having trouble understanding some of this, that's okay. I hope this helps.<n><n>Question 11: Tapanga and Corey are married. Now imagine a time when they have dinner each night. Each night, if they have had the same dinner as the night before, they will have the same amount of calories in their body, regardless of what they've eaten. This is the most common scenario for married couples. Tapanga and Corey always eat the same number of calories together. However, each couple will have different nutritional needs at their different times of day. Let's say, for example, Tapanga and Corey take a nap together after work. If they try to eat the same number of times during the day, their metabolic rate will be different. To figure out what your metabolic rate is, take this two-minute quiz and follow the instructions there:<n><n>How is it that when you are tired, you often forget how much energy you really need until late at night anyway?<n><n>The answer is: "caloric need". Your metabolic rate is the amount of energy you burn, per minute you are awake. This number must be calculated, but it doesn't make too much sense to think of it as "calories". Your caloric needs are similar, just slightly different. I'm going to take an example that your metabolic rate at work is 1000 calories per hour, your at-home metabolic rate is 1500 calories per hour, and your sleeping metabolic rate is 1000 calories per hour. This means that if you need 1500 calories for a nap at work, 1500 calories at work is the same as 2500 calories at home. This will explain why you often get a little hungry before you need more food.<n><n>Question 12:You have 15 minutes to plan a date night with your partner. The average American consumes around 1400 calories in a day. What foods will you choose to eat?<n><n>Input: You have 15 minutes to plan what foods you plan to eat.<n>Output: 0<n><n>The answer to this question is "a good burger and fries."<n><n>Question 13:An airplane has been found to contain a deadly virus.

Ralph spends $350 on tickets and $150 on snacks for the basketball team. He has 3 sons. After each game, he stops at the concession stand to purchase a snack for the team and pays $10 each for the snacks. His sons play for the basketball team every single week and he spends $900 on them every single week. So much time and money went into making them look good, so he figures why not just give all of it back? This way his sons will play a respectable amount of basketball, but won't miss any games and he will have the best of both worlds. His sons only have to worry about one thing: will he buy snacks or not?<n>Output: A-<n><n>Input:Rosa is a teacher at a public school. When she works a week, she buys lunch. Next week, she works her whole week and she buys it again for lunches. She always buys the same food each time. So she decided to change that this year. She spent $25 on lunch for the first two weeks and then $25 the next two weeks for lunch. She has 2 lunchbags. Her first bag has bread, soup and some juice in it. She only brings enough lunches for 1 to 2 days so she uses this bag when she comes in on Friday. The second bag contains sandwiches, ham and lettuce, cream cheese, and peanut butter and jelly. Last week she brought a lunchbox. She used to bring snacks on Fridays instead of lunch because she brought so little, but one of her students got caught smoking weed in the cafeteria and as punishment, they were allowed to buy snack snacks for the rest of the week. When she was teaching, her friend taught her how to cook from scratch so she got to make her own recipes. She taught her kids how to make healthy snacks. So, now when she comes into school on Friday, she can bring a healthy snack instead of a junk snack. She spends 4 hours a week with kids at her school and makes healthy food for them, then she cooks it for them. At the end of the school day, she mixes all ingredients together and packs the box with the snacks. She says that the kids are satisfied after eating them and she gets lots of compliments. After class the kids go home hungry because she wasn't there. She has no idea why so many kids eat that junk food.<n>Output: B

It is interesting seeing the numbers come up when I ask "how many coins have you won?" The question is always given first. But, when you ask a question and it doesn't show up on the screen, such as "are you ready to play", or "are you ready to give me 25 of your coins!", it just makes it more frustrating. I think the screen should display "how many have come out of my chest" instead of showing me the score on my screen, so all I have to do is look at my screen to see how many are in there.<n><n>This was really fun!, and I can say that "this was great quiz" I was wondering to what level is quiz at and I had to play it to find out,,it was great quiz and thank you for this information :3<n><n>I found this article to be a bit misleading. The game is asking how many of these candies did Corey collect on December 31st, 2016. It should be asking how many did Tango collected on December 31st, 2014 which is the birthday of both of them. If you check to make sure there are two Tango candies there then this game is very misleading.<n><n>1.I just started playing it..I'm new to this quiz and really good at it..I've taken it 3 times, but I still like to play....I think it was just some sort of mistake that the quiz was wrong on this one...I wonder which question it was?..Also, I think I know how to answer it...I had 22 candy total when I played..<n><n>2.I was wondering if the game were on iOS or Android or other apps. I know they are on Android apps too, but i'm kind of afraid of downloading an app just to play the quiz..I'm trying to play but I'm unsure on the answers and this is just a bad time to use a new app...Please,

It was written, produced, and distributed by The Bronte Group. The film's co-writer is Don Bluth, and the screenplay is by Drew Goddard and Alan Weich. The film received an Academy Award nomination for best director.<n>The primary plot revolved around the Big Lebowski, a middle-aged white dude with a "lack of tact, intelligence, and even humor". He is referred to as a "retrospective philosopher" who is very fond of weed and beer. In particular, The Big Lebowski is depicted as drinking more beer than most men, whereas the movie's protagonist is drinking wine instead. The Lebowski likes dogs, but is also a firm advocate of no-kill shelters ("I think the dogs should have a little life left"), and it is implied that he may be a homosexual.  The Lebowski also enjoys making inappropriate jokes (such as "I never made a baby with a lady and, I'm not really sure why."), and often uses them to make a bad situation into a bad joke ("What did the man say to the woman when they came together at the party? 'We're going to fuck!'").<n><n>The film received mixed reception upon release, although it became the second highest-grossing non-English language film of all time, with $158.3 million grossed in North America and $214.5 million in other international territories. It was the sixth highest-grossing film of all time worldwide (with $1.28

Tell the child to repeat a few words from the first letter of a sentence. The goal is simple but effective. Tell them to repeat the words as many times as possible until both of your eyes begin to get tired. Repeat this many times for a minute or two.<n>2. Tell your child to repeat the words for some seconds and then say slowly: “You get good at this”. It is a simple but effective form of encouraging your child to repeat words or phrases.<n>3. The more your child repeats, the better it will get. In this case repeating the words for a short time can help as it will help the child to learn the structure of the sentence as well.<n>4. When you start to hear a word that you can not pronounce tell your child to say it slowly and tell the other child what sound the “y” sounds like. When a child can pronounce a word correctly after you have taught them how to repeat it then they are more likely to be successful. Good luck, hope this helps.<n><n>I have asked this question on a number of occasions and i don't quite understand it yet...

The following is a list of their effects.   The following is a list that describes the effects that each food has on the body, if consumed in large servings.   The following list is for research purposes only, so please do your own research before consumption is made.<n>Output:   What is your opinion on this?   Your input: Is the list relevant or no?   Is that a valid answer?   Any correction for this question?<n>Output: The list should be removed.<n>I don't know what these 10 foods are. I'm going to go ahead and guess they are unhealthy.<n>Then why do they say they can be replaced with better foods?<n>The point is that the ingredients of the foods listed are terrible. So just replacing them with better foods does no good. The other ingredients on the list are healthy.<n>It's a list of the worst foods known to man, not food groups. The other ingredients on it are healthy. This is just the list of food groups that are healthy.<n>Well, that makes more sense. The list includes food groups, whereas we are discussing the health aspects of those food groups. So it doesn't make much sense to list the 10 foods that can be replaced with better, healthier foods.<n>I don't really understand all of this. Shouldn't we just put the foods that are bad together to help improve a person's health?<n>All of the foods in the list are unhealthy no matter how you slice it, because the ingredients are terrible. They are made by man; to make a bad item of food good is a very bad idea.<n>Do you feel comfortable putting the bad foods together?<n>Yes, I feel comfortable putting the bad food together. The most important food in our food groups is not even on the list!<n>Then don't put anything on that list!   If you don't care if the food is healthy or not, you could just eat less.   If you really need to make a point about what food to eat, tell them that you ate a healthy meal for breakfast every day, and the only bad thing you did was eat too many cookies. That's exactly what I do, even if it's untrue.

Choices:  A: feeling refreshed B: becoming tired C: restlessness D: leg cramps E: sweating<n>Output:		 all the options are true<n><n>It's an easy task. Just do a random rotation of the numbers. Let's say there are 4 numbers, one is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Now the goal is to pick 1 out of all the other numbers. You can do this multiple ways. For instance, using the "2" rule as an example, you simply pick 2 out of the 4 numbers. The first selection would be "1", the next selection would be "2" and so on. Now using the same example where the number is 1 followed by 4 numbers, you'd select 2 or 3. If you decide the first number was 5 then you'd get 0. If second number was 3, then 4 and then 10. When you think you've found the first number, you have to repeat the process until the third number is found or you can choose the fourth number. You could try it with other values as well.<n><n>I've always enjoyed programming and programming games, and this game reminded me a lot of something I did over a decade ago. My memory is foggy, but it was almost like if I was learning a language and it's syntax, and had to write a program that was written from scratch. I can actually think back to it.<n><n>Some time ago, the game DevOps was going around Twitter being hyped up. It was really popular and got me thinking "hey, I wonder how this game would turn out in game programming if I'm good at it and can write a simple game and make it look cool?"<n><n>And then it all happened. Well, it happened as soon as I got into my old high school, and a guy saw my twitter account, he started talking to me, and I got involved with something I enjoy to play. It turns out this code is written in Python and uses a lot of the components from @saffy's game.<n><n>My current goal is to get the game code as good as I can, because for that challenge I want to have a finished product. In terms of gameplay, I haven't been able to reach more than 20% as good as Saffy in the previous posts, but hopefully this time I'll be able to reach a higher percent. The game will play something like a game about an emergency rescue ship. The ship is under attack from the same aliens, and they have put an emergency lockdown on the spaceship. The players will try to get the ship to safety before the attack

The word "pond" needs to be present in each sentence.    2.    "An animal pond is a deep wet area, usually in a forest, to hold water for animals, although they are generally larger than a natural pond."  3.

The word  pond  needs to be present in the sentences, because the sentence makes a connection with the word  Pond.    2) In the first sentence, an additional  "animal pond" is needed. The word  “pond” does not need to appear at any point in the sentence, as it is connected to the word  Pond. 3) The word “bathtub” and the animal “pond’ does appear in each sentence. The word ‘bathtub’ was used to make sure the sentence flowed from  ‘a bathtub,” to “an animal pond.’ The ‘bathtub” can be seen as a link with the word  Pond, and the word  ‘pond’ links to the word  Pond<n><n>3.  In the second sentence, an additional  “animal pond” is needed. ‘Animal pond’ is connected to   ‘Pond’ through  ‘An animal pond is a wet area to hold water for animals.’ 4) An animal  pond can be used for bathing  and holding water. A  bathtub is useful for cleaning. 5) A bathtub is a place where the  water is held for bathing.<n><n>4.<n>The word bathtub  can be seen as a       link with the word     “Animals bath tub,” to  ‘Animals’.

Choices:  A: cinema B: opera C: party D: stage E: dance<n>Output:		 D<n><n>Answer: A. It depends on where you live. B. Where do you go on New Year's Eve to watch fireworks? C. Where do you watch the fireworks? D. New Year's resolutions? E. New Year's resolutions. F. Family? E. Family.<n><n>Answer: C. Do you find it difficult to make New Year's resolutions? You're not alone: most people do not have resolutions in the first place. The reason is that most people are bad at making resolutions. Instead, they just go through the motions. But there are ways around it (that we didn’t study in this flashcard) – they get a workout, go to a movie, or make a phone call. It’s about making resolutions you don’t feel like stopping – not about not letting things go the way or being focused on achieving success.<n><n>Answer:D. Do good things happen to you at the end of the year? Most people don’t see how lucky they are to make a good decision every day. You know that you should always be thankful for what you have already, however it doesn’t help to know how lucky you are to have some things because you are. If New Year’s Resolutions is a word that would never exist in your vocabulary, it makes you wonder why resolutions at all.<n>New Year’s Resolution is the perfect word to describe the idea of starting something or making something good happen – even though it’s the last day of the year. Instead of being upset because you haven't achieved your New Year’s Resolution, you should be happy that you made one at all.<n><n>Answer:F. Are other people who are not resolutions making people like you, too? If you are not making a New Year’s resolution, why is it such a big deal? New Year’s Reminders could be a good word to consider when thinking about resolutions.<n><n>Answer: G. What year is it? New Year’salentation is a good word to consider.<n><n>Answer: H. What if you didn’t want to work on New Year’salento work New Year’salents, or didn’t want a resolution? We’ll find out what it is to tell you the truth – don’t you worry, we’ll show you with the New Year’salients…and

I was asking for input from people who were more tired or more tired than usual.<n>I am thinking, tired or even exhausted isn't all that useful -- I'm more interested in the effect of being "very tired" - but a good number would make the question somewhat "too broad", isn't it?<n><n>You are right. I was asking for Input from people who were more fatigued or less fatigued than usual.<n>I believe the question is intended to be interpreted this way, although it could be interpreted differently.<n><n>You are right! If I knew what fatigue meant, I would have used that word. I was trying to elicit input from people about how they're feeling on New Year's Day as opposed to "how are you feeling" on January 2nd.

A baby monkey fell and hurt itself badly. When the baby monkey came out of the baby tree, its baby-brother started crying. They decided to help that baby and brought it home. The baby-brother was extremely small, so one of the monkeys decided to give it a bath. When that monkey heard the baby-brother trying to stand, he put his head inside the baby-brother and tried to swim to the tree where the baby monkey was. He thought that he was really getting it, but he kept falling and falling. He couldn't stay long, but before he could even reach the tree from the monkey, a snake made his way all the way up through the branches. The snake saw this and decided to bite the baby-brother. That baby monkey tried to defend his baby-brother, but he fell too. The snake managed to kill the baby monkey in the process. But before the baby monkey died, it gave one last wish: "I want to go out on the street and play with people." It asked God to let it go. God granted him the wish and the baby monkey ended up going to the street. Two different monkey groups lived in the tree from then on, although the babies were the only things that had ever changed.<n>Output: 1. (There were only 3 monkeys in the jungle.) 2. (The baby who fell from the baby tree was very small.)

The goal of the picture is to determine if there is a "gateway" that connects the two points and it is possible to reverse and solve this problem. The solution is: the middle points are in the same place. Note that the student only needed to find one of them. However, using a "gateway" is one of strategies that the students can use to speed up their work.<n><n>In the picture, suppose that the students don't know the numbers on all of their pieces, but they have been given a grid and a clock. They have to find the middle points from (1) to ((2)). Then they will need to find the middle points in their blocks and finally they should add them all together on the clock. A simple way to solve this problem is to simply count the number of pieces in the grid and subtract the number of pieces out of the grid at each point they are needed. However some students might be reluctant to use a "gateway" by using their math skills to find the middle points. So, they should try using a method (like the "gateway") to shorten their work while they focus on getting the number of pieces back, and then finish their puzzle by adding together the pieces on the clock.

Everyone stayed up pretty late that night for the fireworks, to celebrate my 'birthday'. The kids were so good this year.

She asked why I didn't say something in the past to her about not wanting anything for the new year and I explained to her that's why.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute.

She thinks red because it is red. How does Bonnie respond to this answer?<n>Output: Pink or green<n><n>The above question is one of the most common problems kids will have while they work on fractions. I’ve never been able to find an answer that’s actually correct that would help a child learn fractions, so below are several options to help you work on it.<n><n>First of all, we don’t know how long either input can be. Maybe Freddy called his brother, who lives in a different time zone, 30 minutes after he called his dad, so it would be more like 25 cents for him to call the international call. The other option is that Freddy called his family on New Year’s Eve, meaning 15 cents per minute. If you think that is accurate, answer the three questions. The answer to 1 is the easiest since 1 takes three guesses to get, and the answer to 4 is much harder since the answer is either green or pink. Also, Freddy called his brother in the same time zone as himself. If he called his brother before 8 a.m. local time, then it would be easy to answer his phone since the rate is the same for local and international numbers.<n><n>Finally, there are a few other answers I’m not so attached to. So, if your answer is Pink or green, then answer those questions and come back to this question. Then, you can choose your options from those left. They aren’t so good to help you, though, since then you would have to figure out what you need to do to get to Freddy getting 30 cents per minute. The only options I like is A and B. But, when I’ve seen this used, it is to have the child figure out all the pieces on his own. I feel like this only works for people in one country, so it may not be as good at teaching a kid from another country math.<n><n>In general, any fractions used in school need to learn how the decimal is used. Some numbers and math problems are just easier or require fewer decimal points and parentheses. For example, in the sentence below, “You can read one thousand one two hundred four by adding four” doesn’t take very long, but multiply it on the right and you get 1,020, or

Debby lives in California, while Peggy lives and teaches in Canada. Peggy was never married and never had children. While they were both in high school, Debbie had a love affair with a boy named Peter and would bring Peggy home to meet him and the boys on dates and at sleepovers. While Peggy wanted to know who Peter was and would be taking a class with him later, Debby would try and get some information on Peter and if he was real. While Debbie was in the class, Peter was assigned to her for senior year. When the semester ended, Peter told Debby that she didn't pass her class and it was not his fault. The next day, Debbie told her friends what Peter had told her, and they agreed that Peter was the one. So for the next two years, Debbie and Peggy took Peter on every date after school and at school lunches. The relationship eventually stopped. When Peter got accepted to Yale University she became upset because they were no longer going to see each other as often. In 1964, Peter married a woman in Texas; however, a few years later he told Debbie that they were separating. While they were on vacation in New Zealand in 1966, Pete visited Peggy's relatives; however, it was not long before it became known that Peter had been having an affair with her and that Debby was not in on the secret. After she was confronted with all these pictures of Peter, they realized that the marriage wasn't working out after all. After his affair with his wife ended, Peter and Debby stayed in contact but never went out on any dates. Debbie married her husband, Gary Smith, who was also in high school for that year as well. During that time, Debby married Peter's second cousin, John. Once Peter and Debbie separated and John became involved with Debby, John became pregnant by Debby, and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. As his pregnancy continued, Peter refused to allow John to be seen by the doctor for three or four months. When John was diagnosed with brain cancer, Debbie and John spent a very short amount of time together. Peter had already moved past John, and became engaged to another woman. Debby and John got engaged and had a wedding that was videotaped later in that year, but during the wedding, John died in his sleep two

Choices:  A: inspiration B: much work C: boredom D: graduate E: degree<n>Output:		 20<n><n>"Boring" might be the best description of the type of things I did as a kid and I am sure many other school children as well. I guess you could say I was an easygoing person who put effort into his studies but never did anything to earn a high grade point average or high GPA in school. I could go through what my school work was at the beginning of the year and see how it changed throughout my middle and high school years but I'm not sure if it would be enough information.<n><n>At the beginning of my freshman year in high school I took AP U.S. History. It was a difficult class that many students struggled with during my senior year in high school. It was also one of the first classes I started learning in the morning when I got out of school. The teacher was a good teacher. She is also a good person. We had one teacher last year who was a bit difficult to understand and I took her up on her offer to take over my class. I thought it would be a good idea to have an older teacher that I could pay for an entire semester instead of paying for a teacher only for one class. She was much more than I could have ever imagined. At the beginning of the year she told me that she used to teach 8th grade American history and that she had a lot of experience with the AP and non-AP U.S. History requirements at my school. She would only teach 6 hours classes a week instead of 8. She also planned to spend the first semester teaching 8th grade U.S. History instead and after that she would switch to her course load for this next semester.<n><n>It seemed like a good idea at the beginning of the semester. But as the semester started I discovered that I had an extremely difficult first semester. By her plan I would graduate during the winter quarter so we would have 6 classes and 2 semesters for my entire freshman year. My first semester was even more difficult than I thought it would be. I ended up dropping four different classes and ended up with 1 credit to graduate with that semester. Because of that I ended up with a 0 on my ACT score but I scored a 33 on the AP English History and AP US History tests. I had to retake the AP US History exam twice to improve my grade.<n><n>My friend Tabor was the only one who had an easier time with AP US History compared to myself. We also lived in the same apartment building near each other so we saw each

A. is not an answer.<n>II. A is not an answer. Please state why you answered in either of the following<n>a) a, B, C, D, or E.<n>b) a, B, D, E, or I.<n>c) D, E, I, or both<n>d) D, B, D, C, E, or both<n><n>The judges of Tijuana judge by the evidence presented against them. According to them, the evidence proves that the defendants are "guilty" of the crime they are accused of committing.<n><n>Answer 1:<n>The judge decides that the evidence is sufficient to convict the defendant of the crime.<n><n>The judge says that he will take both the government and the defense of the defendant into consideration in making his decision. By choosing to take both the prosecution and the defense into consideration, the judge decides that he must convict the defendant of the felony crime he is accused of committing. In accordance with the law, the trial judge must sentence the defendant to either 20, 30, 40, or 50 years in prison. The defendant then has the right to fight the conviction in court.<n><n>In this way, judges are able to effectively deal with illegal immigrants coming into the United States illegally.

This is possible through the use of policies such as deporting people to their countries of origin when their criminal records indicate that they have been convicted of crimes there.<n><n>Answer 2:<n>The judge does not have the authority to punish any defendant with more than the legal maximum penalty prescribed by state law. Even if a judge imposes a criminal conviction, it does not mean that he is obliged to return the defendant to jail to face the consequences of his crime.<n><n>For instance, a court can still order the defendant to pay part of the fine imposed on the defendant. But if the defendant, who is in a low-level crime and cannot afford any fine, cannot afford to pay his fine, he or she does not have to face jail time.<n><n>Answer 3:<n>The judge can punish a person with a prison sentence (or life) if they are convicted of a felony crime. But it is not the judge's decision if they are punished with a prison sentence beyond their maximum punishment, nor can the judge punish them with a prison

For used cars, the condition is very important, especially in southern regions or in some mountain locations. New cars are usually sold at least a year or more before they become obsolete. A person buys his used car at the sale price and then, over a couple of years, adds in the cost of servicing and repairs. Then it costs $500 (plus sales tax) to have his car inspected to make sure that it is in good working order. The insurance costs are added to the price of the car. This $100 per year in repairs equals a $200 loss of income in the course of a decade. Suppose the cost of servicing are increased by 5%, then the loss from the sale of the used car will be twice as much. How many cars have you owned that cost you $300 or more per annum in servicing?

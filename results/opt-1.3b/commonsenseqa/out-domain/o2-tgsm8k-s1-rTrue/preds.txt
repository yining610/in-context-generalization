The worst case scenario may be that he/she is forced to miss a few days of skiing and more serious injuries are more likely to occur. The overall ski season will be successful but it will be a far less pleasant road to the finish line than if one had just skied 1/2 the time. In the long term, the skier may develop a more balanced lifestyle and become healthier. The overall ski season may go better than predicted (although this is completely contingent on what conditions the skier is skiing in).<n><n>Input:What is the most expensive part of a first car?<n>Output: Car insurance<n>In terms of cost, the insurance for a first car is probably the most expensive part of the car.

Although it isn’t a necessity, having insurance is one of those "nice to haves," and most people have at least a general idea that they should have car insurance.

You may have felt that you could not express your feelings very well around him but I will tell you from observation that it doesn't take much to be very effective at expressing your feelings when interacting with others for this reason....it takes a lot more effort to be less effective at expressing your feelings. But still with time a person becomes very comfortable expressing their feelings...so much so that if you are able to be with them more you should be able to express your feelings better. Remember that it doesn't take "a lot" to be effective in expressing your feelings.. it it takes a lot to be less effective. It takes time to get comfortable with the act of expressing...a lot of time but I believe in the end the end will be well worth the effort. And if you are able to give up your comfort to express your feelings, I can only imagine how that is supposed to make you feel.<n><n>Input: What do most people really care about in the world?

His parents are going to buy him $100 worth of video games (Playstation, Wii and Xbox).  He plans on saving the remainder of his money: $5 on each pay he gets. He has no idea which games he will get and he plans on saving $5 for each game he wants. He plans on donating the rest to charity. What should he do? Output: Ricky chose to save his money (which was $0) from his allowance. He now has $4 in his account, $5 on each pay and $3 on each video game. Ricky also decided to donate his remaining $5 to charity by donating his allowance to charity. This left him with $10. So the question is: Ricky spent $5 on each game, $10 saved to charity and saved the remainder of his money. How much money will Ricky need to spend when he finally gets his money? Output: Ricky will spend $10 minus 2 (since he only needed $5). $5 left in allowance = $5/10= $10. So Ricky spent $4.25 before paying bills, $4.25 after (paying for his own video game) and $3 after paying bills. So Ricky spending $4.25 means he put $9.25 in his pocket. So the final answer is $9/10 = $9.25<n>Output: Ricky is donating $1 to charity.

Choices:  A: go to church B: appear in court C: watch soap operas D: paying attention E: go into court<n>Output:		 You know that God loves you.  But you also know that it is the job of our Creator to tell us what to do.  And when it comes to matters of the heart, Jesus did not leave us with any one specific answer.  But since the Bible clearly states that He was God in creation, our salvation was not so much about doing what He commanded, but being obedient.  Here are some ways that the Bible states what God wanted you to do:<n>Proverbs (5:22) - God is the creator of Israel and she is his bride.<n>"The mind of a creator is like a well-ordered garden.  A garden with every flower growing in the proper season."  Proverbs 14:2 (NSV)<n><n>1 Timothy 2:12 - Every command written in the Bible is given by God to be carried out according to His will.  Remember that each command is given by our Creator Himself and meant for our good and glory.  So even though it is sometimes hard to obey one of the commands, it is not God's command.  If we disobey in order to please our Creator, then we are not obeying His will but our own.<n>Prayer: Lord, I want to listen to all of the Bible verses, and if you really want me to obey your Word, then you will give me an instant inspiration to know what is really, really right.<n><n>Input: A.

They simply require you to answer for each paragraph to show your knowledge of the text and to write some basic strategies for writing. The responses will be graded on whether they demonstrate any understanding of the text and whether they use some of the strategies described in the lesson plan. Your grade will be based on your ability to correctly answer at least one response question and your overall grade will be based on how often you complete all three activities (writing some responses, answering one or two questions, and completing all three activity.<n><n>Your overall grade can change based on each of your overall performance.

She just wants to learn everything<n><n>Answer:<n>In class, we have had problems understanding the concept. The example that the math teacher gave was to take the dollar amount of money needed for a new product. So, the student would take the last amount needed plus the 1. But we need to start at the beginning of the dollar amount and add them together. I used an actual dollar amount at the end and that will help us understand the idea. The student would add a dollar amount to the right of the dollar amount in the math question. Then, add that to the left of the dollar amount in order to get the last number of total dollars needed for the product. Now he can solve the problem with the number of dollars he has left plus the sum of the amount of dollars needed for the new product. Since he is working from the beginning, I want him to make sure to add everything together then solve the problem based on his work and math skills. I then have a final problem to do but it does not require the answers.

He is trying to find a place to live that he can afford that will have the utilities included.  And if that doesn’t work out that he needs to move back in with his parents.  If there is more of a chance that he will find a place on his own that he will need rent than just borrowing against his parents home, then by all means,  he won't be paying bills.    He is in the middle of a job search so that would put up to $6 toward his paycheck.  So the final answer is 6

Choices:  A: stress B: debate C: argument D: winning or losing E: tension<n>Output:		 Stress and conflict are not the best solution.  They can have negative health effects.  They often lead to arguments.  And both contribute to stress.  They can cause some problems if one participant thinks they want to win, the other thinks they want to "win" because they are anxious for the challenge.  In some situations it will be best to avoid stress and conflicts and keep it to a minimum.  The best way to do this is to create two teams that are working together under different conditions.<n>Output: Conflict and stress are not good.  Both should be avoided when possible.  But sometimes conflict can bring some positive health benefits.<n>Output: They work both ways.  If you want to get some exercise, choose a less stressful activity to participate in.

Avoid making decisions with the expectation that the outcome will be good.  You may be disappointed when you realize that you do not have a lot of control.<n>Output: There are many other solutions:  B: Exercise C: Activity D: Challenge E: Compromise<n>Output: B might be good and C good.

But these choices have a negative impact on your health.  You avoid any effort to improve your health and you get a lot of stress associated with the decision.<n>Output: A - Exercise C - Activity B - Challenge E - Compromise<n><n>Input:Two people are going to a baseball game this weekend.

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:The spoiled child's playroom was massive, but only one of many rooms in the what? Choices:  A: big house B: nursery school C: preschool D: building E: retirement home<n>Output:		The spoiled child's home was big and had many rooms.<n>Substituting for the parent's allowance of $5 a week does not change the total, the total is still $5.<n>Since the spoiled child's playroom has only one room, his household is composed of 4 people and therefore it must have a total of 4 rooms.<n>The only thing holding his family back from a larger household is his allowance.<n>The spoiled child's play room is big so it must have at least one play area.<n>The spoiled child is having a very difficult time saving money for a bigger house since he does not have to buy much in the first place.<n>The spoiled child has more than 4 rooms, so it must be his home.<n>The spoiled child made the right choice.<n><n>Input:Zach's total allowance is $40. Zach is saving it to take a gap year.<n>Output:Zach's new year's budget is $40-$40= $<<$40-$40=8>>8.<n>This week Zach will earn $20 from babysitting and $15 from having a haircut.  In total, Zach earned $35 and put $8 of it toward his gap year, so his total is $40.<n>Because a haircut is less than $5, it will be easy to spend $40 and Zach will just have to save more to get his hair cut more than twice a year.<n>There are 8 children in his house and they add up to $40.  He has a total of $80 for the year.<n>His total allowance will still be $40 unless he earns $15 more than week.  Since Zach only earns $20 per week, the total he must earn is $40= $<<$20-$40=4>>4.<n>Which is correct?<n>Input:Mary and Zach have an argument. Zach says that Mary does too many dishes every week. Mary says, "Why don't you do more?" Zach says, "Because I have to wash them all myself."<n>Output: Zach says, "I do dishes once a week because I like it better than in school where we had soap and paper towels."<n>Since Mary's household has 4 people, the total number of dishes she does is 8.  Therefore, Mary has done more dishes each week than Zach.<n><n>Input: Zee's is making $150 this year. The allowance is $20 a week.<n>Output: Zee will earn between $160

One day on Saturday, all his clothes were wet, the bed was soggy and the TV was turned on. When his mother found him, she threw him out of the house and locked him outside for 7 hours. When he came home the next day, he said "I have no idea where I am going to stay now, I'm lost". He had no food in one backpack as he went to the local convenience store to buy food. He did not say "my family is so far away and I can't stay with them.  My mom and my friend are always giving me advice how to work hard and become a good boy.  Is it better to stay at home alone or try to stay with some friends?"<n>Input:Mary ran away from home for 4 days, on Friday night, while she was supposed to be at a friends house, her mother left home with the kids and had to leave them in the hands of 6 adults. How drunk and high were the parents? (Answer: The parents were drunk and high on Marijuana).<n>Output: Mary ran away from home while her parents were drunk and high.  She went to her mom's house and stayed with her for a while and then was home by herself until Sunday morning.  Then she went to another friend's house, while the parents were out drinking with the other parents.  There was no supervision and no discipline from them.  Then Mary asked that she leave.  She told her parents as soon as her friend was out of bed, that they should not give her any money, that she could work and support them, and stay at home. She did not stay with them that whole weekend without money and food. She had to stay with them because the two parents were not able to deal with their children. She told her mother when she came home on Sunday morning, that she would take the rest of the day off to stay with her friend and that she would come home to find food and pay her dad for Sunday. Her mother came home and found her daughter in a different room, and a new backpack. Mary said she was sorry for running away and that if she had given her parents money, would they have given her

He had a 1.6 GPA, and when asked for proof of it, he said:  The school sent him this signed note from his teacher, stating his GPA was a 2.3.

She uses 7 large stickers on the front cover of her journal and 2 large stickers each to 12 other pages.  How many stickers does Mary need to have remaining?<n>Outputs:Mary added 14 stickers total to the 11 other pages minus the 3 large stickers.<n>So Mary added 7 large stickers + 13 stickers = <<7+13=18>>18 stickers to the 11 other pages.<n>In other words, she has 89 - 18 = <<89-18=33>>33 stickers left since she started with 89 stickers.<n>Also from the questions in this section of the exercise, we learned that most questions had a positive or negative value.  If the question asked if Mary would have 89 stickers when she returned her decorative light source or if the question asked if she would have 89 stickers or 89 stickers and an object in a different place from the decorative light source in her possession, how many stickers does the question ask Mary?  In other words, how many stickers is it likely that Mary will have left when she returns the decorative light source and an other item?  This is the last one we have in this section of the exercises and in the following exercises we will be determining Mary's answers to the following questions:<n>Input: John has $25 to spend this week.

Choices: A.  They would change their behavior B.  They would react by avoiding the group C.  They would react the same as before D.   You’d think the sound would change. But in reality, the same sound would still come out. And you’d believe you heard different sounds every time. But it’s the same sound. But maybe the sound was quieter or more distant. But you still heard it. E.G. People in your work group might complain if you start going on vacations. But you would hear the “whine” of the engine all the time. And no one would complain in real-life. But you heard it in a dream. But it sounds different than in real-life. E.G. You hear a loud crash and you see things flying around. But you don’t feel like you were in an explosion or anything. It sounds good in the dream but not in real-life.  If people could predict the sounds the rest of us make, they’d start getting sick. B.  You’d never see anyone getting sick if they understood how different noises can affect us. They might start treating sick people differently or helping sick people. They’d be more alert. D.  You’re probably safe from hearing people complain about loud noises in real-life. However, you’re very unlikely to have a safe environment around if you understand people respond differently to different sounds.<n><n>Output:How does it feel to be a dog?<n>When the dog goes out to play<n><n>When he sees other dogs<n><n>When he’s around people<n><n>In between his owner and other dogs<n><n>When the dog sees other dogs<n><n>On his own<n><n>When he doesn’t know his owner and other dogs.

All you can do is pick up all the fallen leaves.  To pick up these leaves, you'll need some long sticks and a few twigs.  Why do you need these sticks?  Your parents will allow you to pick up leaves if you can grab at least 3. How many does Zach have to fetch before he can pick up only 3 leaves?<n>Output: There are 10 trees with 5 leaves each. Zach picks up 4 leaves and then has to pick up 8 total leaves.<n>The amount of leaves he needs to pick up is 4! - 5 leaves + 8 leaves = 4, therefore 4 = 14 * 14 = 56 leaves.  Zach needs to fetch 56 leaves from the woods to have enough for himself.  He only needs 24 to finish his task.<n>The amount of time Zach has to retrieve this number of leaves is 1 hour = 14 hours<n>Now Zach only needs 4 more leaves to be able to plant a tree.<n>The total amount of leaves Zach needs to pick up is 8 *(28-4) = 24 leaves.  This leaves him with an extra 12 hours of time, leaving Zach at 18 hours to plant the tree before his allowance ends.<n>The final number of leaves he has to pick up is 18 * (24-5) = 3 leafs * (24-5 - 4) = 7 leaves.<n>Output: In total Zach picked up 4 leafs.<n>Since Zach picked up 14 leaves, he has 28 leaves to plant a tree with.  Thus the final number of leaves Zach should take out of the forest is 32, not 36 as Zach originally thought.<n>Input:The water hose is in the bathroom. Zach needs to clean water.

What happened in the 4 hours and what is Amber's response to the question?  Answers: A: Amber left the house B: Amber stopped running<n>Output:<n>Amber now has $12.50 left in her wallet and $3 in her pocket.  Her father made an extra $100 out of this. He can also help her decide what to spend her money on<n>Couple of things I notice: (1) Amber's pocket has $3 and $12.50.  That's an average of $2.50 each in her pocket.  This is significant because $10 in spending money is $20 per trip. You need an average of $40 to get from home to school on a school day (round your city's travel cost to $40 and multiply by city time)  (2) If she did not get in trouble, her father probably got in trouble.  That is, he got arrested and he may be fired.  That would be a loss of $40, which if he's unemployed would be more like $500 than if he's working<n>There is an upside to running away.  If she stops running and does nothing for 4 hours she'll get arrested for running away  There is a downside to running away.

We would rather have them choose something as opposed to always buying the lowest priced items they see.  For example, a child may go to the grocery store but they may see a $1.50 pair of shoes where $2.90 pair could sell for same amount.  They will end up spending more on shoes with a dollar.

I would prefer to see them choose a cheaper item, for instance $0.99 pair of shoes.<n>Output:<n>From the above questions, I have decided that they should try to “dabble" in all of the above.  They should pick a price for shoes that is lower than the $2.90 pair and pick another pair of shoes.

Choices:  A: remember B: help C: count D: winning E: dealing<n>Output:		 I have no idea. My answer is a lot of thinking and guessing.<n>I don't need to count, or to remember, but I think I would have to guess the right answer. I think that I would have to guess that I need at least 6 more cards and 6 more actions in order for me to win. I think I would have a hard time guessing how many more cards I need (probably 3-4) and how many more actions I need (probably 2-3).<n>So the final answer was 6+6=12 with 123 cards remaining for me to get the win.<n>The dealer got $7.50 more than me for cards that I had, but since everything is a set-up and the dealer has already gotten $7.50 more for every card, I can't argue with this decision.<n>Therefore the final answer is<n><n>Input:You make your daily shopping trip to the supermarket but your shopping bag is not full.

If I could have counted the bags and made a guess, I would give at least a few dollars more than what I actually have.<n>So the finalanswer is 4<n><n>Input:You have three bottles: C.B.E. and two L.E.R. You have to fill the L.E.R.'s with the same amount of wine. Why not just let your neighbor do the job?<n>Output:I didn't really want to bother him with this.<n>This is too simple a game. I wish she had added a way to choose the wine that someone else would need to fill. It would make things a little more interesting.<n>Maybe I have too much ambition for a game like this. It's quite easy to fill C.B.E.'s with wine and then the L.E.Rs. with any amount of wine that she deems appropriate. Her choice in wine was probably so that she could use it for both the L.E.r.'s and her dinner. So I think that C.'s and B.E.'s are all pretty equivalent.<n><n>Input and Output:The number 4 is in the center of each plate and each of your coins has been placed in the center of each of your two tables.

The average number of hours spent reading a book can be determined by estimating the number of books that must be used to reach the stated number of words. For example, suppose that one must read 5000 books to read 1000 words. If the number of books read is 5000, then the number of words must be 1000. The average number of words read per hour can therefore be determined in this way: 10−5 × 2000 = 2400<n><n>Output: The average of the number of minutes per week that students spend reading a book is 0.7 minutes.<n>Input: You are reading the telephone directory.

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:What did the business require of everyone walking into their store?

D no<n>This week, Zach received only 3 C's which was his worst week so far.  As a result, he didn't earn enough as part of his allowance to pay for his bike this week and he's upset.  He's planning on babysitting Saturday after he mows his lawn this week to earn enough to buy his own bike.<n><n>Input:The man has a list of items that he wants to buy.  He needs to spend $100 on all of them. What percentage of the list is needed for him to buy all of the items of the complete list?<n>Output:  $100 - $100 + $100 = $93.  If he buys all the items on the complete list, he will have enough money to pay for everything on his second list.  So the final answer is 93 - 93 = $<93>$93<n>Last week Zach received only $30.  This week he received $30 for helping with mowing the lawn again for a total of 3 mowing jobs.  He plans on spending $93 on the complete list which will allow him to spend $92 on the second list.  So total answer is $93 - $92 = $<93>93<n>This week Zach spent $30 on 3 more jobs total that he only received $30 for.  With the $92 left on the list, he does not have enough money to use for a second list.  So he will not be able to spend the minimum on the second list.<n>So Zach's total will be $$62 instead of $93 which is only $6 less than his total from last week.<n>Total spending this week is $56.  Zach spends $$9 more than last week.<n><n>Input:A teacher wants her students to make an impact on the world instead of sitting around waiting for it to change.

Choices:  A + compliment = C + passing grade A - compliment = B + pass grade A - intellectual challenge = D - sticker F: avoid pain<n>Output:- F - passing grade<n>Since the person knows they learned a lot, they are feeling very good about their school work.  They feel confident that they will achieve an A+ passing grade.  They also think that they have achieved a passing grade.  But they feel less confident than they were before the test because on Thursday they were stressed because of a new teacher she had assigned herself.  This put extra stress on them.  However, today after they had an hour to decompress, that feeling has gone away.  Their thoughts are more positive today.  Since they accomplished something positive it is likely that they will pass this test.  They think that they may not have been able to pass it if they hadn’t had this time.  They feel pride in their accomplishment and are feeling very comfortable and relaxed.  Their grades might take a little bit of a hit tomorrow because they worked hard over the week, but they are confident in their current position.  Since they did something good, they are likely to pass the test tomorrow.  A is likely to succeed because of A+ + C + D + sticker.<n>Since they feel very good about their achievements, they are likely to get A + C + D + F + sticker.<n>Since the person is doing well, they may get A + D + F + A sticker<n>Since they are not doing well, they will get D + F + F + sticker<n>Since they are worried about how to pass, they will get D - F + B - F sticker<n>Since they are stressed about this test tomorrow, they will get B - F + D - F sticker<n>Since the person’s teacher is making them uncomfortable, and they didn’t prepare enough, they will get A - B - B - D - F - sticker<n>Since the person has the most to lose from a failing score, they will probably get a D - F + A sticker<n><n>Input:What were some major milestones for your cousin?

Choices:  A: carpeting B: magazines C: strip mall D: city E: applesauce<n>Output:		 B, C, and E: floors, books, and shelves.<n>B means that Zach could buy only the floor.<n>C means that Zach could buy just the magazines.<n>E means the shelves.<n>C+E => floor + room + magazine<n>B+E => books + shelves<n>Zach earned $4 this week, $5 next week, and $3 next week.  Therefore, Zach earned $8 before he could go to the bookstore.<n>When we subtracted $4 from the bookstore, he didn't earn that much, so we didn't subtract much from the next weeks.<n>When we subtract $5 from the magazine, we didn't earn all the money he earned so we added $10 next week.<n>When subtracting $6 from the city, we didn't earn as much as we would have if we had only subtracted $6 this week.<n>Zach earned $8 by babysitting the neighbor's child and earned $11 by buying the carpeting.<n>Zach earned a total of $23 this week, $12 next week, and $18 next week. Therefore, Zach earned $21.  Before he could go to the city, we have subtracted $21, so adding $5 to next weeks will give us a total of $33.  Zach can then go to the city and earn about $35.  After subtracting $1 from this, Zach still is at a deficit of $1 and should go to the store and get more money.<n>Since he earned $32 and was at a deficit, he should go to the store, earn another $7, and earn even less cash so he can earn even more next week.<n><n>Input:If you can get a dog for one dollar, who would you choose?<n>Output: A new toy B a new coat C a new blanket D a new collar E: a new sweater<n>When subtracting $1 from zach, his total is the same as before so adding $1 to the toy will give us a total as $33.  zach can now go get the dog so he can earn about $35.<n>When subtracting the new sweater, we didn't earn enough to buy a sweater, so we went back and subtracted from $33 and gave us a total of $37.  He earned another $6.  Then he can get the dog and earn even more money on Sunday after mowing the lawn.<n>Zach earned another $17

Choices:  A: get money B: pay money C: go shopping D: lose money E: save money<n>Output:		 It's true that most women get money as a gift, but it's also true that many people lose money on products too.  The sales at Target might increase their customer numbers, but their store will lose money on purchases and will be out of stock.  A lot of clothing stores are making more money because they will also make more money on their inventory.  They'll also make a sale by making their products at discounts.<n>Input: The prices on the products at Target often differ from the price on the website, so it is safe to say the prices on the website are the prices they will actually charge.<n>Output: This isn't true.  What is actually happening is that the price on the website is what they will charge you if you go to their store to buy.

The garage is being renovated and the plan is to finish up this year and rent the garage to a friend.  The student has been putting off the move but now the garage is complete and the student will move in and live in the basement.  He's asked his parents for some financial support.  His father feels that the student should have to work part time to cover his bills in order to live on his own.  The father also feels that the student should take a full load and continue his education in order to afford a part time job with benefits.

The student gets off easy because his parents allow him to borrow a bed from a couple of friends so that his room is as big as he needs.  The other roommate doesn't get off so easy.  Since his room is too small to comfortably sleep in, he won't sleep in his own bed with two other people.  He sleeps on the couch.  Therefore, his parents are not as "entitled" as him if they allow

Let us use The sun 2d star as a reference point. Let me get this straight. The sun star 2d is in the constellation of Scorpius. We can use either Scorpius 2d or Scorpius 3d as our reference point. The 3d is next to the 2d. The 3d also has 2 dits stars near. It also has 2 other stars near it. Let's use the 3d as a reference point. Using a 2d star, we know that it is next to The 2d, is in the same constellation and has 2 dits stars in its sky. I want to say that my guess of 2deg is correct. That makes it a little bit too close. Let's use the Sagittarius 3d star as our reference. This star is 12.4 deg away. It is also in the same constellation as The 2d. The Sagittarius 3d now has 2 dits star near, 2 dits stars on the other side of it, as it's sky. This star is 12,4 deg away from the sagittarius 2d, it is not in

Mr. Schoenberger has to wait several minutes before he can leave the building. He looks around and thinks he has forgotten a bag of flour or something but finally realizes that the detention chair is filled with empty beer glasses. He picks up some discarded beer glasses and puts them in the detention chair. When Mr. Schoenberger stands before the class, the students begin to argue and laugh, "You can tell Mr. Schoenberger what to do by looking in his class" the first ten children to speak start to yell in unison, "Haha, see what he did?" Mr. Schoenberger realizes exactly what the kids are doing and says something like "You guys are acting childish but you won't tell me why you're being funny because you're afraid I'll beat the crap out of you", prompting the other students to laugh harder. By the time Mr. Schoenberger steps out of the classroom about 15 minutes later, the kids are on their feet and singing along to the song "Mr. Schoenberger's School". All the children start running to the school, shouting "See what he did!" at their teacher. The teacher is running after their classmates and laughing. Mr. Schoenberger looks defeated but says nothing. He leaves the school but a minute later, the students stop him. "We're sorry, but did you see what he did?! He had those beer glasses all over the bathroom!" "That's so funny!" Mr. Schoenberger says sarcastically. "You people are so funny! I'm going home now!"

Choices:  A: efficiency B: getting work done C: marriage D: finishing up E: results<n>Output:		 The groom and bride will have finished every stage if they propose.<n>The bride will have started the last 3 stages and have been going for 24 hours when the proposal will take place (4 hours for engagement, 5.5 hours for marriage and 8 hours for reception).<n>Because of her hours of work, she will need 8 hours of leave to get to the airport and have time to check in to her wedding planning appointment, give the groom her ring, take a shower, eat lunch and then go to the airport when they arrive. If she takes a day or two off to travel back here, that will mean that she will need to have the ring ready to give to the groom on Monday, at 3:00 pm. In other words, she will be running on just 2.5 hours’ sleep. This will give her just 5.5 hours to prepare, sleep and get ready at her 3:00 pm wedding planning appointment. When she arrives at the airport, she will have an hour-long layover and just 30 minutes to eat lunch. She will also have less time to prepare before the wedding because she will be running behind as she runs to her 8 hour wedding planning appointment. When the groom comes and proposes, he has just 10 minutes to propose and only 1 hour to get to the reception.<n>Of the 3 main stages, the bride will run the stage 3 for just less than 7 hours.<n>The groom will run stage 3 for 6 hours. He will have an hour to propose and 1 hour to say yes to a yes. He will also have only 4 hours to get away from the airport, get ready, eat and sleep for one hour and then head to the reception.<n>When the bride arrives at the airport, the groom needs to be at the airport 10 or 30 minutes before her arrival. Assuming he only gets 2 hours for rest and shower on the flight, he needs 60 more hours to complete the proposal, get ready and fly to the ceremony.<n><n>Input: What is the probability that<n>A: the bride is going to make the flight<n>B: the groom fails to arrive at the airport on time<n>C: the groom and bride are arriving too late to leave their bags in the car. So they have to spend a night inside the airport.<n>D: the groom and bride have been waiting too long for their plane to depart. They will fly to the ceremony only after 10 people have said “I do.”<n>E: people are saying “I

Mary and Zach decided they wanted 3 kids so Mary became a mom again. Zach has to work so his allowance is $1 for every hour he is late."<n>This week, Zach works for $1/hour, Jane works for $1/minute, Mary works for $2/minute. Zach will earn $7 from babysitting and Jane will earn $12 from babysitting.  Mary will earn $22, Jane will earn $32 and Zach will earn $40 because he earned 2 hours babysitting so she earned $1/hour.<n>Because Jane earned 2 hours babysitting, she earns $8 = <<8+16=22>>22 dollars.  Zach earns $40 because he only earned 1 hour babysitting and Jane earns $32 because he only earned 1/2 hour babysitting.  He earns $40 to $40 = 56 to 64 dollars. So the final answer is 64.<n><n>Example Explanation:<n>"Jane and George had 3 children. Mary, Zach and Bethany. Bethany is the youngest sister of the kids Zach and Bethany. Mary and Bethany each had 1 cat. They would take them out almost every day because the mother and husband both had to work and Bethany was the oldest and couldn't take the cats everyday. Because of her younger age, Bethany would have to work more hours than Mary. Zach and Bethany would both earn $8 each."<n>"Jane and George decided to have 1 cat. Zach was to stay home at the same cost as Mary but for less hours. He would save $1 a day and Mary would earn $8. Bethany earned $7 from being a baby sitter. Zach earned $4 because he only did 1 day of babysitting. Bethany earned $4 from babysitting Zoe.

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.

Choices:  A: open letter B: thank god C: say goodbye D: bless you E: listen to radio<n>Output:		 Open Letter The letter is probably in the form of a thank you letter or thank you note.  You could write it out, fold it in half, and put a copy of it in a letterbox to give the person who has opened up to you that day.  You could also leave it in your car if you're going into work and the person you're talking to doesn't seem to mind.  You probably don't need to tell them anything though, just a small thank you.  A thank you thank gives a person a great way of saying thank you without being pushy.  They might reply 'you're welcome' because they think it's the polite thing to do.  Either way, you don't need to communicate with them anymore<n><n>input:What are some of the things you dislike about your job? Choices:  "Don't be stupid!" "Get me to a safe house now!" "I want you to clean this stuff up!" "No!"  Output: "Do it before your sister comes back!"  You don't need to tell the girl what to clean up, only make her realize you are not happy about her dirty hair and unkempt body.  You should tell her that she needs to clean up her house after her sister leaves because she won't have a nice place to sleep in the future.  It will also teach her to clean up her act to others, which is what you're looking for.<n><n>Input:What are the main steps you must take to get from A to B in one day?

Choices:  A: apartment B: table C: school D: office E: house<n>Output:		  C: couch E: bed F: bath<n>I wouldn't put the laptop on the couch. If I did I would need to move the desk because of it being a very tall dresser.  I like the way the computer would sit on the bed instead but that leaves me with just one desk.  I only have 2 bedrooms, so I would need an extra couch.  If I gave it to my dad, either he or my mom would move the desk.    If I put it on the table or the bed or on the chair, I would have to move the wall behind it.  If I put the laptop on the table or the chair, I would only need to rearrange the chairs and put the desk back.  I don't like rearranging everything though so this would not work for me.<n>I would put the computer on the bed for convenience.  I'd have to move the couch to make space for the monitor.  Also, it helps me get to sleep faster because I don't want to watch stuff while laying on my bed.   I like the bed for comfort and I don't like the monitors because it gives me bad vision and then makes me feel like crap.    I'd move it onto the couch for comfort.  I'd have the laptop sit on the bottom of the couch to avoid the TV, but I might be able to use the couch to use the laptop.   I don't like the monitor so I'd move the couch.  If I tried putting the laptop on the floor, it would make my laptop hard to reach.  And, if I was like Zach, it would interfere with my sleep.  I'd have a much nicer experience if I put the computer on the table.  It's pretty small, isn't it?<n>I'd put both the computer and the desk on the chair for comfort and to keep my work area looking organized.  The monitor looks much nicer on the table so I wouldn't want to see it on my couch.   I hate the monitors.  I'd prefer to put the computer on the floor.  The couch would be hard to use as a desk anyway; you can't sit on it like you can on a chair.   I'd move the couch to the floor and put the computer on the desk.  It would be much easier than moving an object from the bed to the couch, and the couch is much more comfortable than the floor.  The desk

He says that Ollie was a beautiful child, but his parents never cared for him.  When Michael's parents were moving from their old house to a new one, they said that Ollie shouldn't go.  Ollie ran away and fell in love with a famous actress and she married him.  She gave Ollie money to move to Hollywood and Ollie went and lived in LA for a while.  He decided he liked the big city and came home, but he never learned the language.  So he settled down in NYC and worked at some fancy clothing store that sold clothes from all over the world.  He had lots of friends and some beautiful ladies.  He eventually married the actress that he loved and had 2 children.  He had them both stay with him in NYC because his parents couldn't afford to take care of them.  In the end, both of his children became famous.  The story of the boy had been written by two others, one of them was William Shakespeare.  A book of poems was published in England a few years ago and one of the poems was called "A Boy Called William."  Since the boy was a famous poet and the other poem was about him, some people thought they were related and decided to kill Ollie.  They thought of different ways to kill him.  They thought of shooting him in the head, stabbing him in the back, or shooting him in the mouth.  Some decided they would drown him by throwing him into a river.  Ollie was killed in the bathtub when his wife came home.<n>Output: Michael got to write a poem of his own, since Mary also made the story (The Man in the Mirror) but wasn't as good of a writer as William Shakespeare,<n>This week rumors of goblins killing villagers could cause what?

(Choose one) If you were a college professor who was teaching a class on music, what is the first thing you would recommend your students to do when preparing for a test?Answer: Print.<n>### Question 2. How can a piano help you learn how to play an instrument?Answer: Practice. It takes a lot of practice to learn how to play an acoustic piano, but it will also help you get rid of any insecurities you have while learning. If you can do some small exercises on your own, you will be able to play for yourself faster and more accurately. By the time you are done, many of the insecurities you had will have been eradicated.<n>### Question 3. After you learn how to play the piano and you’ve practised some, what are the steps you need to take to play without mistakes? (Choose one)Answer: Get a music stand to stand the piano up and practice every day.Practice your music as much as you think you suck at it, and try to make sure it sounds good too. If you aren’t happy with the sound, then do something to improve it. If you want to get better, then you have to put in more practice.<n>### Question 4. The first time you’ll hear a recording of the song you’ve learned to play, what will you play?Answer: I won’t be sitting in front of a recording because it would be too hard. I’ll probably play a song that we made for ourselves or something we have on our computer that we made on purpose. It would probably just suck, but I think that would be the start to learning piano.<n>### Question 5. Your first time learning how to play a keyboard, what do you first recommend?Answer: I think you should make it your first priority to practice to learn something that is truly worth learning.<n>### Question 6. If you’ve learned how to play an instrument but haven’t learned how to read music, how do you learn?Answer: Use songs that you want to learn

Each student will receive $55 for college each month.  If they earned $50 per month each last semester, they will earn $85 per month this next semester.  They will have enough money remaining to buy a car in August or September.  How much more do they need to earn before they can buy their own car?<n>Output: Zach and JoAnn need the following to earn the car in August or September:<n>* $150 for Zach each month<n>* $85 (or $50/month) for ZAnn<n>* $100 for all of the family for the month of August<n>* $100 for $100 of ZAnn's<n>In total for the entire month, the household income will be $215.  The only remaining $35 must be earned for the household to earn $200.  So the final answer is 214.  It is difficult to give a satisfactory answer with only 214, but the best is 214<n><n>Output:What would be a good option if you do not have enough money to pay the mortgage, and you want to cut down debt?

They were $20 each.  Her parents both agreed that they should go ahead and get them.  They then discussed that she could use her allowance to pay for them.  She was also interested in getting a belt for her backpack and wanted to purchase the $15 that was going to be used to buy it.  She also wanted to buy another bag to put her extra pencil cases in.  She started saving her money from the allowance, but decided that perhaps she could just use her allowance for these purchases.  She ended up spending $30 on the glasses because she kept buying herself more pencil cases, and the purse because she used more of her allowance on her backpack. She also bought a brand new jacket because her car broke down, and her parents decided to buy some clothes for her to wear with her new jacket.  Finally, the bag she paid $15 for has not arrived and was not included in her parent's budget for shopping.  So she used the money on three other items.  She used the money her parents agreed to pay her to pay for the glasses, the bag and the coat.  So, in total, she used $30 on three other things.  This week, she paid $20 to have her parents buy her the sunglasses.  Now she only has $35 to spend for the remaining $14 in her allowance.  Her parents should not purchase her new shoes because her parents have been paying for her shoes for a long time.  The other suggestions would be more useful options.  This week she only pays for the sunglasses, the bag and the jacket.  So she has spent $35 = <<3+35=46>>46 on the things that she thought would come in handy.  Her parents should be more useful suggestions. So the final answer is 46<n>(<<3+35=46> = $<<3+40=62>>40)<n>(<3+40=62> = $<5*21=36>>36)<n>(<5*21= 36> = <<$80-$83>>80)<n>(<<$80-$83>> = $<<$5*20=29>>29)<n>(<<$5*20+30= 37>>37)<n>So this week, Zach should not have saved his money.

"Field" and "field" work well in one form of the other, and you'll eventually have two nouns that fit the pattern and act similarly.<n><n>In the meantime, I have a question for the group: Are you sure in this specific case the crowd is in a particular way to be described by a particular pattern?<n><n>I agree it wouldn't necessarily work in this specific case, however I would say that the "elements" of the "field" in that case would not work together, for one the "elements" form a distinct pattern. But, they are all elements in the general sense of the terms - elements of the crowd. The people gathered by the crowds represent a particular group of people, those at the center of the crowd represent the larger group.<n><n>But - again - in the larger sense of the term "elements" - they all form a different pattern that does not fit. The crowd has elements of the crowd - yes, but it's not a pattern that fits this particular group.<n><n>So that I guess brings us to the actual answer...<n><n>If the answer is no one should worry about how the elements are represented in the sentences as the answer is, on average, that the sentences in this example do all fit.<n><n>But in some very few cases you may find where a different answer fits for some reason.<n><n>I want my students to start

Let's review it and come up with our next correct answer.<n>We can easily identify the first letter on the first page of the dictionary for our answer.  If we divide the word "coop" by 2 we get 2 + 2 = 4 and divide the rest of the word by 4 we get the first letter of the dictionary.  For the end game of our exercise, we will use the end of the definition of "coop" to look at the end of the definition.  As we wrote in the answers below,<n><n>"The coop was an open area used often for<n>caring for the chickens, or keeping them near to<n>food and water."  This is the first definition.  If we take the end of<n>the dictionary and divide by 2 we now have "The coop was an area used often for caring for<n>the chickens, or keeping them close to food and water."  The end-<n>game answer of the end game would be "The coop was either open, which<n>is 4, or enclosed, which is 5.  If the coop

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:What body of water is typically shallow water? Choices:  A: lake B: aquariums C: swimming pool D: pond E: childrens pools<n>Output:		 Water will be shallow for the most part at all of the options (except in E)<n>This week the swimming pool will be shallow (E)<n>When Zach's money is running low, he will go to the dollar store to get some groceries.  A few dollars are saved each week to purchase groceries ($10) and he will spend about $30 in gas ($7 per quarter) to go and get groceries.  One full week, Zach's total savings will be $20.  He will earn $7 from his $10 coupon, $7 from the gas and $7 from eating out (a total of $14).  We'll add up his total savings over three months and divide $10 x 2/300 = $10.  Zach will receive about $24 total in groceries for 3 months and we'll subtract $12 from that amount (roughly $4 or $8 left) and give him an $8 credit. This means Zach will need to earn about $42 to cover the costs of groceries before he is able to spend his money on a new bike.<n><n>Input:What do you think the greatest risk is of shark attacks in Florida? Select 2: Boat, Jet Ski, Sailboat, Tugboat, Snorkel<n>Output: Boat, Jet Ski and Snorkel are the greatest concerns.  We will go with Boat, Jet Ski and Tugboat<n>The boat is definitely the #1 greatest threat to swimmers.  In order for a boat to be an effective way<n>to keep swimmers from being pulled under, the water needs to be at least 3 feet deep.  In Florida,<n>the average depth is about 2 feet.  The surface of ocean water is about 6 feet with water temperature<n>ranging from 73 to 86 degrees (depending on the ocean's water pressure (how much air is trapped underneath<n>the surface of the water, e.g. water is pressureless at sea level but a bit of pressure builds above sea<n>level) and air pressure is only 10 to 15 psi at sea level and then rises to 20 psi at higher altitudes)<n>Most likely to be attacked by "shark" are divers.  A boat propeller can hit at about 1 to 2 mph.  A<n>tugboat propeller, which is used to move a boat along the bottom of a lake or ocean floor, can also be<n>hurtful to divers.  If the boat is going too fast, the diver will end up in the

You can see that it's pretty messed up on my part. I used the font that is on the left instead of the one to the right, because it's easier to see what is covered on the left side. I really like my new layout, though, and I will be using the font you provided for a while!<n>P.S. : I forgot to mention the picture I chose for "Inside Out" from the movie Brave!<n><n>Here is an updated version of my journal.

She had just finished the laundry and was going down the hall on her way to put it on the clothes line.  She saw her husband, father and 2 other men and she walked up to them all.  A man and her husband were laughing about how strange it was that two women would be at home in the afternoon.  She then asked the man next to her to ask what they were laughing about.  The man said, "Oh, that's nothing.  We were just joking around.  That's it."  When she asked him what he was laughing about, the other woman said, "I think it's just you two.  I know we're not that strange."  Then the man in the next house asked her what they were laughing about because he thought it was just normal for women to be at home all day.  She said that when they were at home it was sometimes normal, but sometimes they'd sometimes stay out all night.  She said that the "other woman" said something along the lines of "When were you girls getting home?"  The man said, “Well, we were at the bars last night and the women were taking pictures of us on Snapchat.    The woman then said, “Well I'm sorry, it's nothing.  I don't know your names so why would I care?"  The man said "That's not what I meant.   It's just odd that two of you are at home when I am at the bar with all of my friends."  The woman then replied, “Well, it's not like I've ever met any of your friends.  Do you really think it's weird that two of us are at home when men go out?”  Then the man said, "Oh I'm not worried about all of the guys that I see outside.  I'm worried about you two."  The woman said, "So, it's OK that you're all over here hanging out with your friends?  You didn't see us hanging out or anything?"  She asked him if it were okay if the other women stayed

No.  You didn’t hear an audible sound.  No one in the forest noticed a sound from the tree falling.  There was no one watching the bird to make sure it didn’t fly away.  There was no bird to guide the bird’s flight.  There was no person to stop the bird.   There is no sound until you listen for yourself, but you probably ignored it because you were distracted by what else was going on. But there was an audible sound — a sound at least — when the tree fell in the forest.  What was the sound?  Do you listen when something is no one around? or when someone is right in front of you?  Do you pay attention to ‘The Sound of Silence’?  Do you pay close attention to the sounds around you?  Or is the ‘Sound of Silence’ just the sound of your own thoughts?<n>Output: What made this noise?  It probably was the sound of some birds singing — or the birds not singing.  It probably was the wind ruffling the leaves or maybe it was the other sounds in the forest.  But if it was the noise of one of the things around you, would you notice?  The answer is ‘No’.  ‘The Sound of the Silence’ is not made ‘for listening’.  The sound is the sound of your own mind.  There were no sounds around you to listen to.  There is no ‘sound of silence’ when the sound is ‘made’ by other people or when the sound is so much louder that you can hardly hear it.  It was probably the sound of a person who noticed that something was wrong with the sound.  Who heard it?  Who heard it and was responsible for correcting it?  The answer is: ‘No.  You didn‘t hear it because you could not hear it’. The answer to the question is ‘No.  There is no sound when there is no one around and no sound when there is someone around�

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:The student needed to  get some new pencils, where did he go? Choices:  A: store B: classroom C: backpack D: cabinet E: teacher<n>Output:		 The student bought 2 pencils at school - the pencil of his class and the pencil of the class next to him.  He chose to use the class pencil, taking the pencil of his next  teacher into consideration.  This is his most effective way of spending money.<n><n>In the end, Zach used the  pencil of his class.  He did not buy the pencil of the next classroom since he knew he'd need to give it away and it was more valuable. Zach plans to continue using the class pencil for the rest of the week because it was easier to buy there and he'll not need the free pencil of his next teacher. The student received a pencil of his class worth an extra $0.10 from the teacher, but that does not help him in his homework. Since we know the teacher values it above the rest of his classmates, and given that he has already saved up the difference for his  pencil of the class, we'd give it to him this week.<n>Since Zach spent his money on pencils, he'll earn a total of $0.10 for both classes and his extra $0.10 is worth nothing. The $4 will be wasted money for the next 2 weeks.<n><n>Input:  Mary has 89 stickers.  Zach has $5 in his pocket. There are 90 stickers on the front of Mary's journal. How many stickers will Zach be able to complete by the end of the week? Outcome: 1.5 stickers = <<5+5=10>>10 stickers 2.25 stickers = <<12+12=18>>18 stickers<n>Since he has 10+12 stickers to go, Zach has 12 + 12+18 = 20 stickers left.  At this point Zach needs to spend $6 to finish all of his stickers.  Zach planned on spending the rest of the money he has saved on the bike ($45) at the grocery store, and after completing 14 stickers he must choose one of the 14 options in the list below. If he chooses another of the 14 options we would pay him a total of $7 since the only difference so far was $5.  Since the bike does not cost $45, we'll just pay him $7 and cancel the order. This will save $8.  If Zach chooses to save the bike, we would need to pay him $2 from our account for it and then cancel his order.  The total amount we'll have to pay him is $11.<n><n>Input: The student needed

Choices:  A: suicide B: overdosing C: sadness D: murder E: cyanide<n>Output:		The suicide leader was a college student. He suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder - which is known to cause excessive fear and anxiety.  He also had a fear of eating so he developed a fear of cooking a meal.  He would often eat so he could avoid eating.  He would then eat everything he cooked.  This led to an extreme fear of cooking.  He became obsessed with the fear of cooking so he created a book full of recipes detailing how to cook specific things safely.  He also developed a fear of cutting his own hair.  This led him to cut his own hair to avoid the fear of injuring himself in case of an accident.  He then began hiding his true feelings so he was able to keep a facade of a normal life.  He started this obsession with food by trying to eat through a straw.  The straw would be the safest way for him to eat but he would occasionally make a mistake when eating with it.  He would then feel really gross after eating. People noticed that he was so obsessed with food that every time he ate, he would have such extreme anxiety that he started to suffer from severe food poisoning.  He eventually realized that if he ate properly, he would not get food poisoning.  He became obsessed enough with cleaning his own house that he started cleaning it multiple times a day.  The home cleaning led to him taking up collecting dust bunnies because they would make him happy.  Eventually he stopped cleaning after a year when he was feeling extremely guilty and realized it was destroying his life.  This started his obsession with dust bunnies.  He collected one dust bunny and was so obsessed with it, he collected thousands.  Then his depression set in and he became extremely depressed because he thought he would die without the dust bunny.  He did not want the dust bunny to die so he felt so guilty about not cleaning his house that he made sure he cleaned his house twice a day for 18 months.  At the end of 18 months, he had collected all of the dust bunnies he could.  He felt so comfortable with being clean that he stopped cleaning.  Eventually the dust bunnies took over his mind until he would eat.  At that point, he started eating everything he could.  He ate a lot of food.  He started getting more food poisoning.  And then his entire family started getting food poisoning.  And when they started getting food poisoning, he started getting more food poisoning himself.  And ultimately, he started choking

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: pantry C: grocery store D: pantry E: refrigerator<n>Output:		A jar is appropriate in kitchen, pantry or refrigerator<n>There is enough moisture in all of the three jars to make them begin to spoil with time.  However, if we use a jar of honey, the moisture will not enter the jars so quickly because honey is a solid.  If we use jar o milk we would need to remove the glass lids and pour the milk out to remove the moisture.<n>Therefore, a place where the jars are not likely to spoil is in a refrigerator where the refrigerating unit is on, since the moisture won't get in there.  A choice that is appropriate is a kitchen cupboard.<n><n>Input:John worked for two hours on the roof last weekend for $3 an hour. He made money because he was using his money at the time so he used this income to get other items for the house. After paying off the mortgage, he will now earn $3 per hour. How many items is he going to buy with that income? Output:John's income is $3 per hour.  He earned $3/hr last weekend by mowing the lawn, taking care of his dog and working on the roof.  If he continues working for the same pay, he will have $3/hour of additional income by buying some household items.<n>Output:Total income will be $3/hr.<n>Therefore, he will spend $3 on household items after paying off the house.<n>A kitchen cupboard is appropriate for the kitchen.<n><n>Input:If there is going to be a new baby at the end of the month, and we have enough money to buy a crib and high chair, is it better to buy the crib together or buy them separately? Output: We could have either purchased the crib plus high chair together or we could purchase each item separately.<n>Each item would cost $35.<n>If we purchase a crib with the high chair attached, we will save $9 because the infant seat has a $39 price tag.  This means we have a saving of $13 after taking into account the discount.<n>Therefore, we should buy the crib together.<n><n>Input:Suppose you had a little boy who is 3 years old. He has never been around dogs before. He is starting to walk, talk, and play with other children. Will you let him come to the park or will you keep him at home until he is 6?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:Where are people likely to find food? Choices:  A: opera B: supermarket C: building D: conference E: apartment<n>Output:		Where are people likely NOT to find food? Chooses:A: on buses B: at bars C: in public D: on buses E: not in public<n>Output:Where people will normally NOT find food is in the opera category, since it would require a significant time investment of not eating to get there and eat in the bus. People ARE going to have to go out to eat at least once a month, or every couple of weeks, during their stay, in order to get food. Therefore, the location to find food will most likely be in the B-category.<n>Input:If Mary was to purchase 2 new outfits, she would have $49 left.  If she bought 1 new outfit, and Mary went home with 2 extra outfits, she would have a total of $109.50.<n>Output:If Mary were to purchase 1 new outfit and Mary went home with 1 extra outfit, her total would have increased to 99.50. Now, Mary has 2 extra outfits and only $59 left to spend.<n>Solution:<n>* Mary bought 2 new outfits = $159.50<n>* Mary wore both outfits and wore them both at the same time = $101<n>* She wore 1 outfit and wore it alone = $59<n>So each new outfit she bought would only be worth $59.25<n>The total of 49.25 = $59.00<n>Now we need this money taken from her checking account, and the amount must be spent before 2/19.  Our options are, either:  1:  Mary gets $59 back by spending the money on Tuesday so she can spend the rest of the money on the other expenses listed above (i.e. mowing the lawn on Saturday).<n>Solution:  * Mary spends the money Tuesday: The $59 refund remains in her checking account and will be deducted from her checking account on the 19th.  Therefore, no money will be transferred to her checking account before 2/19.<n>* Mary buys 1 new outfit: The new outfit is worth $59 so Mary will get the whole $79, so she does not need it transferred to her checking account on Tuesday.<n>This solution is still worth $59.00 to Mary. Since she needs the $59 to buy 2 clothes and has already saved $65, the new outfit is worth $49<n>Therefore, the solution is:<n>* Mary spent $49 and received $59 back from the checking account. Therefore, the amount in her checking account is $

If she divided the letters into 16 squares, then each square represents one letter from a particular set of letters.  What was the ratio between the largest and smallest letters in each envelope?  Your answer will determine the order of letters in this set.  Your answer will also tell you the number of letters that had multiple stickers in them.  Your answer will be at the bottom as you fill in the blank space.  Your answer can be any combination of any of the following: 2/4, 5/8, 3/4, 1/2, 7/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 8/16, 2/4, 5-8, 9/16, 10/16, etc.  Output:<n>Mary divided 15 symbols = 2+15+16/16 = 2/4<n>Mary divided 12 symbols = 5/8<n>Mary divided 8 symbols = 3/4<n>Mary divided 8 symbols<n><n>The letter symbol is in bold.  This will be your starting point in figuring out the letters that were written.  You can pick up any letter symbols if they correspond to any of the letters in the set you want to fill in.  Use the letter symbol to find which two letters are closest together.  Look at the two next closest letters to see if they have any letter symbols.  These are the missing letters in a set.  The next closest letter starts with that combination of letters.  When you see an empty row that begins with a letter and doesn't have a symbol on it, fill in the row by looking at the next two closest letters that have a letter without having the symbol that it starts with.  This may take some guesswork.  If the set looks like this:<n>Row 1<n>Row 2<n>Row 3<n>Row 4<n>Row 5<n>Row 6<n>Row 7<n>Row 8<n>Row 9<n>Row 10<n>Row

I want to get an idea of what students tend to think an intersection should look like at a red light. Is 1.5-2 miles of sidewalk enough, or would students prefer more?  If I get more than one answer, how many might I come up with?<n>Input: How many students do you think were at a red light on this afternoon?  The following is an estimation based on the number of red lights on the road. Do you think this could be a better estimate?  2-5?   1-3? ?   8-12 ?   How can I estimate how many students were at the red light today?  I need to know how many students walked to the intersection, cars entered the intersection, and students waited at the intersection for the light to turn green, then came out of the intersection to get on their routes.  How can I estimate the number of students waiting at the intersection?<n>Output: Can I estimate how many students would stand under a red light on this weekday afternoon?  The number of people waiting on the streets in this block might have an impact on the number of people standing at the intersection at a red light. The number of people waiting around a corner might have an effect on the number standing underneath a red light. For people waiting in an intersection with a very small number of vehicles, the number standing under a red light probably won't be affected.<n>Input: If there were 5 cars in the intersection, where would your estimates be in relation to each other based on which were driving?<n>Output:  1:  I would think cars would drive slow, since they aren't going to stop for the light. 2:  That's right! I would think cars would stop for the light and move onto the other side of the street. 3:  I have a feeling cars would drive a little faster.  I think students would be walking to the intersection, looking for the intersection, looking at the cars waiting to enter and getting on their routes. 4:  That's what I would think, because walking to the intersection is easier than moving a little faster. 5:  I feel like cars would drive a lot faster

She uses 3 large stickers on the "front page of her journal" and 7 stickers to other pages, giving her total of 89 stickers available.  Her parent will pay her an extra $10 to "mow the lawn."  How many stickers does Mary get? Output: Mary added a total 5 stickers/page * 7 pages = 55 stickers to the 6 other sheets.  As mentioned earlier, Mary has 89 - 55 = <<5+55=44>>44 stickers remaining. She adds a total of 11 stickers/page * 56 pages = 53 stickers to her journal. Since she started with 89 stickers in her journal, she has now added 53 - 55 = <<5-55=42>>42 stickers. Her total remaining sticker count when adding up all the pages to one sheet is 55 * 56 = 110 stickers.  How many cards is she holding?<n>Output: Since Mary started with 89 stickers, the total number of cards is 110 + 11 - 55 = 130 stickers. So the card count is 130 - 111 = <<129+111=126>>126 stickers in her journal<n>[IMG]ww.webster.edu[/IMG]<n>http://images.webster.edu/piazzariolabs.com<n><n>To answer the question about Zach's total cost: We need to subtract the $69.85 he will earn on Saturday from the $65 in savings from being able to babysit. The total cost of his bike is $100. So he needs to earn $9 to get to $109. If he is able to babysit for 2 hours he can earn $9 on Saturday and $10 on Sunday to get to $109 in savings. He needs to earn $4 on Saturday to net $10 in savings. Since he had $65 saved already, there are no additional cards left. The final total number of cards he has remaining is 54 - 69 = <<109-69=51>>51 cards<n>[IMG]tw.math.columbiumathletic.org[/IMG]<n>www.piazzajs.com<n><n>[IMG][

Choices:  A: communication B: suffering C: pain D: laughter E: embarrassment<n>Output:		  When you trip in front of a large crowd, you sometimes need to explain to strangers what happened.  While you may appear to be ok, your friends will notice something is slightly off.  Even if you aren't really injured, you might want someone to explain what happened while you recover.  This may cause you to show more emotion to strangers than normal while you're on crutches.  Some people feel better about falling than others, so you'll want to be careful about how much you talk while you're on crutch and even make sure you're walking as comfortably as possible while you're getting ready.  You may be embarrassed in front of your friends, so try to avoid expressing your embarrassment to strangers.  When you are injured, you may show compassion to others by bringing them water bottles and a blanket to keep them warm and ask them questions about their leg or about their injuries.  Others may need to explain to you what happened, so you will need to be patient and respectful.  Remember, you can try, but chances are most people will prefer it if you explain everything to them.<n><n>Solution:  A: Communication:  Answer: A. This emotion has nothing to do with the breaking of a leg. B: Suffering:  If your friends did not notice something was'slightly off', you should be able to explain the event. C: Pain:  You should ask other people questions/express help. D: Laughter:  You will want to laugh and express that you are not upset.<n>E: Embarrassment:  You may have to explain the event.<n><n>Comments:  A. Communicating:  The person falling in front of a crowd might be a bit embarrassed because a lot of strangers can see that something is wrong.  The reason is that most strangers may be the same size or just as you - the reason that you can see them is probably because it was a big crowd and the light is reflecting off them.  B. Suffering:  If you cannot explain everything, ask other people what you should do.  C. Pain:  You may not be able to explain everything to your friends, so the best way to go is to ask someone else's opinion.  D. Laughter:  If you can not laugh through the pain or embarrassment, you might want to share your pain with others.<n>E: Embarrasment:  While you don't want to show that you are embarrassed, you also don

Choices:  A: happiness B: pleasure C: happy D: grief E: isolation<n>Output:		Happiness = $<n>Couple's friendship = 10%<n>Grief = 25%<n>Sole Survivor = 80%<n>So, the wife has a 10-15% chance to receive happiness (even from nonfriends) or at most, a 45-80% chance to receive grief (for the sole survivor).<n>For that one friendship, the wife has 80-15% chance to get the joy of friendship or at worst 90-15% chance to be grieving alone.<n>For the second friendship, a significant risk of happiness (in addition, she could also get the joy of companionship) or only about 50% chance to be grieving.<n>For the third friendship... she has a 55% chance to receive either pleasure or happiness, or at most, 80% chance to grieve.<n>A significant probability of happiness (10%) and 25-40% chance to grieve (for the sole survivor) make the marriage (or single parent) successful.<n>The husband's risk to choose grief over sex is significant, but he has a chance to grieve - not more than 50% if he has a partner.<n><n>Input:The government taxes the income of both the male and female of a family by creating an equal percentage tax on each. The tax is 50% percent for the mother (the government pays her 50% tax on the income she earns, as does the father). The sum of the tax rates is 100%. The tax is then distributed equally to the children born as part of the family.  What is the expected standard deviation of what the government will take from the male and female of the family? How much does the result vary from a perfect equal distribution?<n>Output:The expected value is ~100 -50 = 5<n>Expected standard deviation = 10 - 50 = 5 * 1.20 (1 in 10000) =.1 (0.00001)<n>A perfect equal distribution of the tax rates (exactly 100%) results in the expected value being around.08, thus an expected deviation of 0.05 to.1. That would be a deviation of 2.2.<n>If we estimate a difference between the two tax rates, we estimate that the difference between the two tax amounts is 2.38 * 1012 ($13,000 - $8,700, based on the total number of children). Therefore, 2.38 * 1013 = $5.19. That result is greater than the expected value.<n>It is expected that about 75% of married

What happens next?<n><n>Input: What is the name of the school?<n>Output: High school<n>I need to understand an equation.  I know that it takes 4 hours to earn 2 units.  In 3 hours, I will earn 6 units.  So the equation is 2 units in 3 hours.  I also need to know the number of units that I earn per hour.  The only way we can work that out is by adding to the total hours of activity.  It takes 4 hours to earn 4 units. If you need to earn more than 4 units in each hour, consider adding an extra two units for the extra time.  Let's say you earn 6 units in each hour.  Then the total units earned per hour would be 6 units + 4 hrs = 6 + 4 = 8.  So the problem is 8=10+4=12.  I will add 2 units and say that it gives 12 units, and since we can work 10+4 for 12, that means we will have 12 hours to earn an average of 26 units per hour, which is 10 units per hour * 4 hours/2=4.<n>Input: 4 hours to earn 2 unit.  2 units to earn 3 units.  3 units to earn 4 units.  3 units for 4 hours to earn... 2 units = 16 hours.  12 units * 36 hrs/12 = 52 units of activity.  10+4 * 12 units = 32 units per hour = 30 units per hour * 36 hours/36 = 48 hours<n>Output: 8 units*48 hours = 32 units = 16 units (per hour) = 5 units of work on the day<n><n>Input: Bob and Mary are going back to high school to change their careers.

Choices:  A: compliments B: understand themselves C: life partner D: second chances E: larger house<n>Output:		 1. The couple is on a break and the husband buys himself dinner at McDonald's that is $.10 a piece.  He gets up, makes a clean one-sided bed, and turns it back around after he eats.  He puts back his clothes onto all the chairs around the couch.  He then makes that $4 into a $2 purchase.  By doing that, he gets $.40 of each person's money.<n>2. The husband thinks it is $.13 to make a clean one-sided, half-priced bed.  He gets up but then proceeds to make the bed the same way as before.  He puts his clothes back where they belong.<n>3. The husband buys a gift card from Walmart for $1.50.  The wife gets up and tries to clean up the living room before going to sleep.<n>4. The husband is given $.35 from each parent and he uses that $.35 to pay off their debt.  So here the wife is making the whole family $.35 and the husband is only making $.35 and $0.35 from each.<n>5. The husband is given an envelope for $.15 from each parent.  He spends those funds on a bottle of wine and sends them an email apologizing.<n>Note: There are so many ways to spend money because there are so many reasons to spend money.  And because of this, the answer to how many extra kids does the couple need is not always obvious, as there are so many different types of options for families.  What we want to see as kids grow is a parent who is willing to put in extra effort to try and help them learn to appreciate the values they have been taught because it is important that they learn this at a young age.  At the same time, we want kids to have a wide spread of friends.

He knows that it will be a good fit and he has experience, but he doesn't have all the qualifications that they're asking for, so he's worried about what? Choices:  A: acceptance B: rejection C: hope D: less sleep E: employment<n>Output:		 Acceptance * 15 (15 being the most likely)<n>If he got an acceptance, he wouldn't have to worry about not having all the qualifications, and getting an appropriate position would be much more likely.  He's also not worrying about the interview anymore because he has all the jobs for which he needs the most experience.<n>If it's rejected and he has to go back on the wait list, it sucks, but it's probably not the end of the world either. You'll get the job eventually, and it will be better than the jobs you had before you got rejected.  He'd rather have a job he really wants than a job he could be glad he got even if it meant lower pay, especially if he has to be a bit more desperate to get it than he would if he just applied everywhere.<n><n>When you take the above information into account, it seems like it's likely that he will get accepted if there are available positions still (or very few).  If there are no openings and nobody has called him, they'll likely call him back eventually so they can have an honest discussion about his job application.  But this also has the potential that he'll just find something else and continue to hope it's not an interview, but if he just gets denied because there are no openings, he might as well go back to waiting a few weeks until there's a better chance at an internship.<n>On the flip side, if he's interviewed and he gets the job he wants, then that means the interview went well, and he's got more work to do while in school.  In that case, it would be less stressful than going back to the wait list until he's able to find a better job.<n>Either way, if he does get the job, he's got work to do and he's going to need to work hard at finding the time necessary to get the work he wants doing by when he's finished school.  If he waits to find a better job while in school, it's likely that that job will just be worse than the current one, so it might be better not to start working while he's in school.<n>One last thing, he should probably save up his money before the interview because he might need it to get started on the job search.<n>Overall, he's likely going to be better off working than going back to school if he has to wait a while until the job is available.

After that call, he sent her a package with the ring which included the ring card.  After that parcel came, the man phoned once again and told Mary about his dilemma.  He asked if she could send him one of her mother's rings as a replacement.  Mary called her friend Sally and they worked out a plan that would cost her only $10. Sally said she would get two rings and one would be for her mom and one for the new man's mom.<n>Mary thought about the possibility of sending the new man's mom a ring and called her friend back.

Choices:   A: cheating  B: being rejected C: a heart break D: betrayal<n>Output: For relationship A to work, they must be together.  Relationships B and C need to be mutual for any relationship to work.  Relationship D need to be mutual for a relationship to last.<n>If both B and C are mutually agreed for relationship D, it doesn’t become a betrayal because it still benefits both parties.  Similarly if both C and B are mutually agreed for relationship A, it does not become a betrayal even though relationship C does not benefit in return.<n>If A needs another person to be there to be rejected by D, someone who is not mutually agreed for relationship A is not going to be there.  That person will not want to be rejected by D.  Being rejected by D is not a big deal.  Being rejected by a loved one is very hurtful.  Therefore if A is going to be rejected by D they want to find someone they are emotionally bonded to.<n>Relationship A is a bad idea if there is no mutual understanding of what B and C are willing to give each other, especially if they don’t agree on the level of investment.  The only way for B and C to come to their own understanding of what they are giving a others is to have that person come to them.<n>In the long run, relationship D has a better chance for success than relationship A. If A wants an equal partner, C should be able to come to them with a proposal to find an equal partner.<n><n>Input:What do two different types of words mean in Chinese?

He asked his neighbor to do the same.  Seth asked his neighbor how much he spent his own money to buy books for his kids.   The answer:   Seth asked his neighbor $5.  Then, Seth asked his neighbor how many books his kids bought.  The answer is $10.  So the total of each neighbor's money is $10 + $5, $50 = $60.  Since they bought books together, the final answer is $90.<n>So the final number the neighbor asked was $90.<n>But before this, both Seth and his neighbor asked their parents to spend money for their children.  Seth's mom bought $80 and his dad gave $80.  This is the total of $80 + $10 = $80, so it is $80 that the neighbor asked each parent.  That total is then added together to $80+$10 = $80.  This total sum is then divided between $80 and $10, $80 is divided equally between $20 and $20, and $10 is divided evenly between $20 and $10.  $40 remains, $40 divided equally among $20-$10 = $40 $40 - $20 = $40 $40 divided evenly among $80-$20 = $40.  $40 divided equally among the other choices is $40.  The final answer is $60.<n>So the final total for $60 is $60.<n><n>Input:Lance gave one of his dogs a bath.

If you didn't want to be working with any of the wood, you would want to be working with something else.

They made it clear that they were asking for $7/hour, but they also gave out $10, $15 and $20 payouts so that each person would not know what it cost them. We had exactly 3 people give $10, 3 gave $15 and none gave $20.

What's the best color to scratch the ticket?<n>Output: What color are the most likely numbers drawn this Friday?<n><n>Feedback:<n><n>To help the students get a better understanding of their own money situation, I chose 4 scenarios.  In each, we would ask them to estimate how long it took them to save their money.  They would then have to find out, how much money they would need to save to win the money that the lottery would reward based on their predictions.<n><n>I found that in at least some scenarios, they came up with surprising answers.  For example, their estimated saving time for the most likely numbers drawn was 5 minutes.  On the other hand, some students would estimate that it would only take them one minute.<n><n>I found the following examples, that illustrate the point, to be helpful:<n><n>Case #1: Scott lives 50 miles away from his parents home and has no dependents. We ask him, how much money from his allowance can he save if he buys a scratch-off ticket and wins $100? He estimates, 50% of his allowance that he got on Thursday.  The math seems a little on the low side, but what should we use to estimate how much money he would need for 5 minutes in order to play the lottery?  One minute of play time = 50×.4 =.$4.40 so we use $4.40 x.5 = $52.40 as our figure.<n><n>Case #2: Scott has an allowance of $30.  From his sales job, he earns $100 per week on average.  He says that at worst, he'll need to work for a couple of hours on his birthday, so his time-to-win ratio is 7 minutes.  So what is the most likely time frame to win the lottery? We chose 20 minutes as the highest probability.  Based on Scott's answer, what do we estimate from his estimate? I added an extra 10 minutes in order to make him estimate a little closer to 8 minutes.  We use Scott's estimate to estimate, how much money he would have to save in order to win? We then use his prediction of how many minutes it will take him to save this money to calculate how much total he will

Choices:  A: attic B: trash C: loft D: closet E: box<n>Output:		The box was near the attic since it had not been used in several years.<n>He did not find any decorations and put the items back in the box as is.  He did however, find a few large envelopes in the box.  Since those envelopes have been in storage for several years, he was unsure of what to do with them.  He did not want to put them in the garbage and he wanted to save the boxes from his dad's closet.<n>Since he found a few big envelopes in his boxes, he brought them all in together and sorted them out.  He decided not to throw them away because he already had a few envelopes and had no use for more and then he got an idea.<n>Zach placed all of the envelopes in his dad's closet so that they were all together with the rest of his clothes, and he would not need to carry everything he found in the attic and put it in his closet when he went to the garage.<n>Zach placed the envelopes on his dresser where he knows they will be out of his way and he would not forget to check them at school in December.  He thought it would be best to leave one envelope in the box on top of his dresser because it would catch attention and he would not have to take it off.  The box on top of the dresser was a little taller than the dresser, but the envelope is close to the wall. If he forgot to check the envelope at school, he could always grab it from the top of the box and open it while standing.<n>He has been keeping a small pocket dictionary on his dresser too.<n>His father came by and he was able to grab the envelope with the pocket dictionary and bring it upstairs to Zach's room.  He placed the envelope on the corner of the bed next to his locker instead of on top in the closet.<n>Since his father is a father and has many little boys, when Zach was around age 8, he also had a pocket dictionary.  He would have used the pocket dictionary when he was in school, but once Zach turned 13, his father began using the pocket dictionary for his boys and Zach didn't want it.<n>Zach's pockets are full of his family's photos, old clothes, and a lot of pictures of his brother.  When he decided to save the envelopes and get rid of the pocket dictionary, he did not want to get rid of his photos, but he did not want to

The rat is also given a pair of small boxes and told to find the number to which the paw on the larger box is aligned.  The rat is then given two boxes in which to put its paw.  These boxes are identical in size.  The rat does both tasks simultaneously, but the larger box is never seen again (by the rat).  The rat goes on to perform the same experiment on other rats and shows the results.  The results of the experiments are as follows:

The kittens need to be in order and none of them should get a bath until a certain schedule.<n>With the kitten inside, a bowl and lid should be in it's cage.  The cat should be kept away from the other kittens while they are eating and sleeping.  The other kittens should be kept away from it's food dishes, but with the kitten inside it would probably like to eat all of its food, so the kitten can't be bothered if they try.  The owner also needs to make sure it isn't scratching.  If someone tries to pet the kitten that is not allowed.  Only one kitten is allowed to get any attention at any time, unless it is nursing.  The kittens should be allowed to be cat lovers in a way that they aren't being taught to be predators.

Where would he look? Choices:  A: fish market B: hawaiian waters C: gulf of mexico D: tropical sea E: south pacific ocean<n>Output:		 fish market<n><n>Input:Jenny was looking for a good deal on a new vacuum cleaner.  She went to four different malls and could only find one that she liked that she could afford.  She spent $50 to buy a $300 vacuum from Sears.  The model also included $75.  The vacuum comes with a $500 power tool.  She also bought $20 in accessories.  Who will make more money, Jenny or Sally?<n>Output: In store purchase, $50 to $50.00<n>Out of store purchase, $130 to $130<n>Jenny made the purchase in store and Sally bought it outside<n>So Jenny makes the purchase in store only and Sally buys it out of store<n>So Jenny only owes $200.00 in total and Sally only owes $150.00<n>So the final answer $200.00 - 150.00 = $200.00*100.00 = $250.00<n>The purchase from Sally was done on Friday before school<n>Sally's household budget is $700.00, so the purchase would only leave $300.00 left.<n>So the family has a budget of $700.00 leaving $500.00 for their weekly allowance.  If Jenny saves $10 from each new purchase she will earn $160.00 in savings each week.  Sally's household budget is $420.00, so $250.00 to $270.00 left of her $700.00 to spend.  Sally will earn $160.02 in total in savings every week.<n>So the net benefit of saving for both Sally and Jenny would be $160.00, so Jenny is now saving 60% more than Sally does.  Next year Jenny will be buying for Sally, Sally's going to have to keep selling her to make up for it.<n>So the final net benefit of saving for Jenny will be $160.00 and Sally will have to spend 40% more than she already does.<n>The family will have $140.00 left of their $100.00 allowance each week when they need it for other needs.<n>So Jenny can save an extra $10 next year to put aside for Sally.  Next year Sally will not be able to keep her old spending habits.<n><n>Input:Jack decided to buy himself new shoes.

Rather, it moves the masts on what? Choices:  A: sailing vessel B: paddleboat C: ship D: motorboat E: tugboat<n>Output:		 Sail a vessel. A vessel is a vessel that sails. Sail a ship is a vessel with the sails. A tugboat is a vessel that is used to tow ships. A motorboat is a vessel that helps propel a ship.<n><n>Input: The helm moves a boat.  A boat is a vessel that sails by pushing the steering rod with his left arm and pulling the rudder with his right hand.  A sailboat is a vessel with sails to help propel the boat through the water.  A tugboat is a boat by using hydraulic hoses to turn a tug that pulls the hull of the boat through the water, and it also pulls the boat's bow and stern.<n>Output: You can push the rudder with your left hand to propel your boat, or you can pull the hull by using your right hand to push the sails.  Either way, if you push the rudder with both hands using your right arm, you are moving the bow and stern by pushing the mast (i.e. pushing the helm out of the way).  If you push the mast out of the way with your right hand using your left arm, then the steering rod is moving forward, and the steering wheel is moving to the right.<n><n>Input:The vessel's sail is an integral part of the vessel's structure.  The size of the sail determines its strength and the speed it sails at.  A large sail is difficult to control.  Smaller sails are faster, yet less maneuverable.  Most sailboats have a single large sail, which is attached to the mast (i. e. the fore and aft "sails").  Smaller sailboats can move much faster than a larger sailboat, yet the larger sail must be moved by hand.  Ships are built to move quickly and without the assistance of a crew or other vessels, and in this way are referred a "mechanical sailboat", as they are moving without the aid of any human being<n>Output: You can pull your sailboat through the water by pulling the rigging with your right hand, although the sails cannot be moved by simple pull (i. e. you cannot just pull the sail out of the way).<n><n>Input:If she sails without a crew, can you push the boat?  If you can only propel the ship when you are standing on a rail and not on a boat itself. You would propel the ship by moving to and fro on a rail. You can move from where you start to

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:She'd sooner just spray herself with water than the what she didn't like the smell of?

Maybe my brain has just blocked it out since I'm reading this as a 5th year student.  Which scent is the scent?<n><n>Input: He lives alone and his income is $1,100 a week.  His parents pay him $200 for his transportation.   His allowance is $35.  Their son's is $17.  He has 2 years left to go in high school and he will get a job when he is 19 as a dishwasher at a restaurant.  What is the amount of money he can earn to buy all of the following items in a year?<n>Output: $1,100 - $17 - $3 = $<<1+3=2>>2<n>He currently earns $200 a week which is just under $50 a week so he can purchase 1/3 or about $10 worth of groceries.  This is only if he can find a job and that job doesn't last for more than 6 months.  If he decides to take 1 year off then he will need to earn about $60-70 a week and that will only last him about 1/2 to 1 year.  So the total amount he can earn to buy these items in a year is $1,100-70-2 = $<<3 + 2+2=6>>6.<n>If the rest of his family has to help him with these expenses since he will only buy groceries, then they will have to contribute $5 more per week towards his $35 allowance.  So the total would be $50-$60-$4 = $<<3 + 1-$3 = 4>>4<n>If he is an only child and relies on his parents for everything, then his parents need to offer up to $60-$70 a week to help him live and eat.  If he was an only child and was living with a family where he is helping with all costs then he would need to earn even more if he is an only child.  So the total for him to buy groceries on his own is $150-$150-$2 <> $<<3 + $

Choices:  A: pharmacy B: person C: drugstore D: bedroom E: mcdonalds<n>Output:		 Where can someone buy a contraceptive device without a presscription?<n>The options are:<n><n>A: pharmacy<n>The only one that requires prescription is for the pill. All others require no prescription unless there is a very good reason for a prescription.<n>Since the pill is available to buy without prescription, we will move them to "A".<n>B: pharmacy<n>The only contraceptive methods that cannot be purchased without a prescription are condoms, IUDs and emergency contraception.<n>Since these are widely available, we will move them into "B".<n>C: person<n>There are some people who do not wish to be in relationship with a certain person. They do not want to see or be with that person. They do not feel responsible for the consequences their actions have to result in, so they do not wish to be with that person. This would be considered "person" where "pharmacy" would be a possibility. Also note that this would make the contraception information section a little longer.<n>D: drugstore<n>The only method of contraceptive use that does not require a prescription for prescription is the IUD, although the method is very different than what is available in the states, I do believe that this would be a less controversial selection than A or B.<n>E: mcdonalds<n>The only contraceptives available within a given area and not sold in another state, or in other countries, are not contraceptives at all, yet they do supply a method to those who wish to prevent pregnancy.<n>The other option would be "mcdonalds".<n>Since pharmacy is not a viable option, the option of a drugstore will have to be substituted.<n><n>Input:<n>Mary has a journal.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:Where can you buy socks and jeans? Choices:  A: washing machine B: laundromat C: clothing store D: closet E: shopping mall<n>Output:		 There are 3 available socks and 1 available pair of jeans in America.  In this country you can buy a pair of blue jeans from any clothing company and get any pair of socks from any manufacturer.  This website gives you information like:  Size charts  Colors and fabric choices  The materials (polyester vs. cotton vs. denim),  and the prices.<n><n>So to answer this question, Zach buys his jeans at the "washing machine section" (blue jeans section) of the nearest clothing store (Walmart) and he buys some blue sock at the "clothing store"(not jeans or socks) section and puts them in his closet.  This will get him the answers - 6/5/94 - the $94 he needs to save * 6 *(6 - 7)*= 6 *(6 divided by 4)=$6.  The last two places to buy clothes is the "clothing store" section(blue jeans section) and the "clothing supply" section (not jeans/sock).  He can check these locations at www.huffingtonpost.com/2004/05/16/womens-clothing-usa.html<n>From there Zach can order the pair of blue jeans/sock from http://www.nike.com/ and get the information like what size he needs/price/color/fabric/materials/etc.  Because he already has a sock and a pair of blue jeans, he already has $34 * 6 *(6-7) = $34-14 = $94 - $94 / $36 + $14 = $94 plus the $35 he earned * 6 *(6 divided/4)=$36-$6 = $84 for a total of $134 - $134 / $36 = $84 + $34<n>So the total is $84<n>Since he already has $94, he can use the $84 to buy the bike.  Using $20 of his allowance to buy a bike and $1 to spend on clothes(showing a balance of $5 to spend), Zach will buy the bike for $85.  Since Zach wanted to spend $14 on clothes, he will have a $20 balance to spend.  Zach is now saving the remaining $7 from babysitting and mowing the lawn ($20-$7) so he can buy the bike.  $140 will buy him the bike.<n><n>This week he had $10 in allowance, $14 in

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: medicine chest C: armpits D: grocery store E: kitchen<n>Output:		 There are 3 categories to choose from.  You choose your first option (A).<n>1: Medicine cabinet<n>The cabinet contains the medicine bottles and syringes.  They are all in good condition.  They are neatly divided, and there are labels on the bottles.   Each bottle is labelled with a code.  You can count how many capsules, 1 teaspoon, 1 tablespoon, etc are in each bottle.  You can use these capsules to count how many times you used each bottle that day.<n>Select your second choice (B).  Choose medicine chest<n>The medicine chest has one drawer.  You choose an item from that drawer and put it in the medicine chest.  If you are going to take it home with you from the hospital, do it correctly.  The drawer may be labelled with a code. The drawer may have one medicine capsule in it.   You will need to count how many times each medicine capsule was used or how many times you used a certain medicine at a certain time. For example, to count how many times an antacid was used on an empty stomach, you begin by counting how many empty stomachs you have had.  In this example, I counted empty stomachs when I ate breakfast.  When I felt my stomach begin to upset, I counted how many times a digestive enzyme was used.  When I had a headache, I counted how many aspirin I took.  When I had an upset stomach after waking up, I counted how many pills I took.   When I felt sick, I counted how many antibiotics I took.  The drawer may label the pills as capsules or as tablets. You can count how many times you took each pill. You may also have to count the doses.   The drawer may be labeled as capsules or tablets.  You may use these capsules to count the doses. In this example, we counted how often an antacid was taken.  When I felt sick I counted how many times I used each mouthwash.  When I felt well I counted how often I took each medicine.  The drawer may have one mouthwash in it.<n>2: Medicine chest<n>The medicine chest is like medicine cabinet but there is no drawer.  Instead you choose items from a medicine cabinet that you will keep at home or a pharmacy.  You may count how many times you open it, how many times it was opened, the dose you filled, how many times it is sealed, and how many times it was put back.

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.

Choices:  A: appear suddenly B: bottom out C: go downtown D: scream E: roll over<n>Output:		If the salesman B appears. He walks right past the guy and talks directly to the young girl he's just introduced himself to. He then moves to the other guy and greets him as he goes to the parking lot. There's a quick flash of a grin from the other guy and the salesman continues to walk down the sales lot. When I look at the sales car from the street it looks like a white 4-door sedan, but as he keeps walking, it appears to be a much sleeker looking black SUV with rims. So the salesman walks down the sales lot for a few more hundred yards and appears in the left lane of the highway heading towards the airport. He then turns left at the last minute and heads straight up the road towards the airport landing strip. At the same time as he's doing this, the sales guy at the window starts turning in a sharp left turn just as the guy coming up the same road as him starts to pass him. He suddenly turns into a sharp left turn and suddenly cuts back in the road at the last minute. This means the salesman must have been able to see the person coming up the drive way. He then speeds up, climbs into the back seat, opens the passenger door and gets inside. He then gets back out through the right-side passenger door and slams the door. He then turns left and goes back towards the airport. When he cuts back in the road he suddenly turns around in the parking lot and goes back where he came from, but only goes back to his left after that. And then he speeds up after that so that he can turn right and get back in the back seat of his SUV. At the same time he gets in again while still turning left, then he starts singing the song that was on the radio back at the car dealership. At the same time someone opens the passenger door and the window on the driver's side, that person is the guy who just made the turn into the driveway. The car dealership salesman continues to talk to the girl he had just introduced himself to, while his suprise co-worker is suddenly cut out of his conversation. He then goes over to the woman who just bought the car his coworker was sitting in and puts an item in the trunk before pulling out. He then climbs into the SUV behind her and starts talking to the man who just called into the conversation. The woman in the trunk then gets in and puts her item in the second open seat in the front of the car.<n>He then gets back in the

Zach says 10. Mary replies 5. Mark asks what Zach does each day. Zach replies 8. Mary replies 12. Mark wants to know how much more work Zach does each day than Mary every day since Mary takes on the additional work.   Zach replies "I don't think so." Mary replies "He says he mows the lawn more often than me." Mark asks for Zach to prove it. Zach refuses.  Mark points to a big red "D" sticker and writes it on a piece of paper.  Zach refuses to admit that he mows the lawn every day and writes the "D" on a piece of paper to prove that he does not.  Mary gives Zach another chance, but he refuses again.  Mark gives Zach another chance to prove his innocence. Zach says he helps Mary mow the lawn less often than Mary because he doesn't want to mow the lawn each day.  Mary gives Zach a chance to prove his innocence by saying he has only ever mowed the lawn one time.  Zach writes "I've only mowed the lawn once" on a piece of yellow paper.  Zach denies that he has ever mowed the lawn even once, and writes "I only mow the lawn once, because I'd rather sit in the house and read than mow the lawn."  Mary takes a red "A" sticker instead of what Zach gave her. Since Mary has taken the "A" she cannot use the written evidence to prove that Mark was telling the truth. Zach's testimony would be enough to clear his name.  Zach asks for Mary's permission to use his written evidence and she gives him permission.  Zach gives Mark another chance to prove his guilt.  Zach says that he mows the yard once.  Mary says that on June 3 Zach mowed the lawn once.  Zach gives Mark a second chance to prove his guilt by saying he only mowed the lawn one day.  Mark takes the yellow, written evidence for Zach to read.  Mark takes one look at Zach's evidence and gives Zach 2 minutes to respond. Zach refuses to answer, and writes "I have only mowed the lawn 1 time." Mark gives Zach another chance, and asks if Zach has ever lied about anything in the last 4 years. Zach says no, and writes "I did not say that."  So Zach is guilty and the

If you live in Baltimore, you should know about this.  Many residents also take turns planting stuff in their yards, or in parks, by the public schools, or by other groups.  A local grocery store sells vegetables which also grow on their property.  Most of the vegetables come from "certified organic" gardens and are in organic greenhouses.  It's like getting fresh veggies delivered to you every week.  There's also a local farmer who grows apples and a local coffee bean vendor for coffee as well.  There's a farmer's market at the end of all that, too.<n><n>I've always been into gardening and I think this initiative is awesome.  I'd definitely like to go somewhere where there is no electricity.  My first attempt at gardening, which was a pretty pathetic green thumb, was so unsuccessful that I haven't looked back.  Of course, there are no organic growers here.  But, at least they are planting fruits (or rather, veggies, but I'll leave that one open for discussion) and vegetables in gardens.  So, I decided to grow basil (to make pesto), tomatoes (to make salsa), eggplant (to make fried eggplant), and peppers for salsa.  The basil, tomato, eggplant, and pepper plants arrived so easily and were happy and healthy right out of the ground.  They were healthy and the basil was strong and green -- it's the only growing plant in my garden.  I decided these plants were good and that I would use them as sources of pesto.<n><n>So, I planted some basil, tomato, eggplan and pepper plants at the end of last week.  I've been working on my tomato plant, and have put a lot of time into the eggplant (which didn't sprout, but the first leaves have started to come off).  I decided to put tomato plant at the bottom of the garden.  The eggplant and basil are in the corners, and I put a pepper seedling (I got it in a box from the farmer's market, but they had just picked it from seed, so I didn't bother with it).  I put the pepper on the other

You may also end up picking out a few pairs and bringing them home to see what they look like with different outfits, but I doubt your choices will be as obvious.  Which shoe to choose won't have much to do with what shoes you already have.  I don't think any shoe will look better for an extra pair, though.

You should probably look down at these options and choose the shoe most likely to go with clothes you already have:<n>A: A pair of comfortable shoes<n>B: A pair of cheap shoes that look good with work clothes D: A pair of shoes that go with every outfit and look clean while doing it<n>C: A dress shoes that go with work clothes, and make jeans look good B: A pair of dress shoes that don't work with work clothes<n>D: A pair of dress boots that go with a nice jacket and a dress shirt<n>E: A dress shoe that doesn't look great on you<n><n>Input: Which of the following makes you feel the most warm?

Your answers should also describe some of the consequences of not cleaning the sink. Your answers must also describe why you should clean it. Your answers could be as long as an essay.<n>Output:<n>Cleaning the sink is easy, just be sure not to get too wet while doing it.<n>The sink will look bad to other people so they don't want to share their food with you. If you don't get your teeth washed out then you may catch something or you will forget. Also make sure you brush your teeth or wash your hands before leaving the sink.<n>The sink will make the floor dry out, especially if the humidity is above 55%.<n>It takes only a second to drain, so if you don't drain quickly then you can have your sink clogged<n>

A: Mary decides to go to Germany to get a job. This gives Zach motivation to go for a job, too.  At the beginning of February, Zach decides to go to Germany for a job.  He has to wait for his parents and their friends to get there.  On March 2 he must report to work.  On March 5, he has to travel to Germany to collect his parents and friends.  They drive back to Philadelphia with John and Alice.  They have to catch the train in the morning, so there is another delay.  On March 6, once they arrive, there is a meeting to plan a day trip to the beach. Zach gets fired and is depressed.  Mary arrives home on March 6 and has the opportunity to meet John and Alice for the first time.  A lot of time was spent together. Afterward Mary, Zach and John went shopping. 
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:What do you do to hold loose papers together? Choices:  A: tighten B: packaged C: bound D: faithful E: compact<n>Output:		 (C is correct; answer A is incorrect)<n>Since papers can't be held together in their current state, it's best to use an envelope to take them out of their place instead of putting them into an envelope.  Use an envelope for a few reasons:<n>1. Paper is easy to fold.<n>2. When a teacher opens an envelope to grab something inside, it looks like someone had some kind of accident inside.<n>3. An envelope keeps things in its place and away from other parts, so it's best to use it to hold loose papers together.<n>4. The envelope doesn't break, which is important when a teacher might be inspecting it for hidden items or things that might fall out.<n><n>Input:If you could do any job right now, what would it be? Choices:  1:  Secretary 2:  Farmer 3:  Lawyer 4:  Teacher 5:  Doctor<n>Output:  I do any job that I can do.  I do work full time as an accountant and I do some volunteer work for my neighbor's church.  I do this job very well and because of that I can make $400 per month.  Sometimes I have to travel to my office to keep everything working properly.  I don't mind missing a couple of days here or there because the money I make is more important than missing two days a month.<n><n>Input: If you could have any job in the world, what would it be and where would you want to go? Choices:  2:  Doctor 3:  Accountant 4:  Farmer 5:  Lawyer<n>Output:  1 - I could be an accountant  2 - I could be a lawyer  3 - I could be a farmer  4 - I could be a doctor  5 - I could be any other man or woman<n>The doctor is probably the most flexible job in the world because you can travel when necessary.  Some jobs like to be on the frontlines so there really is no reason other than the need to help someone in need that the doctor can't be an accountant.  Sometimes you need to be on the front lines in order too, so it's better to be an accountant.  It seems like the farmer doesn't make enough money per hour so I'd be a farmer too.  The only problem I have with being like any other man or woman is the amount of taxes you need to pay.  You don't get to leave your house very much and

Choices:  A: obtaining information B: exchange of ideas C: sharing information D: conversation E: gathhering of information<n>Output:		<n>During the brainstorming session when we were trying to determine what we would want to hear when we are trying to obtain information, Zach talked a lot.  The only "answer" we could come up with to that was to ask him what he had learned about the story from the book.  So we gave him the option to answer the following questions:<n><n>Input: what happened to Zach during the brainstorming session?<n>Output:  You know how the old joke says :  "The reason why there are so many bicycles is because there are so many bicycles".<n><n>In other words Zach was telling us what the characters in the book told us about the bike they were trying to buy.  This is a common approach you can take during a brainstorming session that gets your thinking out of your own head and allows other people to give you an answer.<n><n>Input:In our discussion there was a lot of thinking about: 1: what? 2: what? 3: what the what? (I am having a hard time imagining what Zach had been thinking about)<n>Output:  The question: What was the point?<n><n>Now that we've come up with a question we can follow up by asking the same question to Zach.  We can then get his answer as he will understand what the question means and we only need to use the same phrasing to get the answer.<n><n>Input : In the story (the book) which of the following people was the only one who had never worked?<n>Output : Who was Zach's character?<n><n>Now we know who Zach was because he didn't say anything that could have been interpreted as excluding anyone, so we have no problems understanding and understanding the question.<n><n>Input : What happens exactly when Zach enters the house after he's been babysitting?<n>Output : Will Zach notice his "mum" or will he have his mind blown with the knowledge that he's been babysitting for so many years?<n><n>Again we know Zach's character so we know what happens to him after the other adults leave.  Since we know what happens Zach can now answer the question when we ask it.<n><n>Input : During the reading of the story Zach was talking a lot.  He was asking a lot of questions about things like where things come from and what happens next.  You know how the movie "The Notebook" tells the story of a heartbroken girl who wants to be with someone and cannot do that because she's too afraid of

Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n>Output:		Groomers are often recommended to teens because it is greasy. When grooming, teens are often thinking about what it looks like to their parents. Shrubs keep the hair clean and shiny. They add a freshness to the hair and keep it healthy. To keep the hair "clean" they should be trimmed. If they are too long, they can clog the drain and drain, too. The longer hairs won't let soap or shampoo past. When shampoo is in place, shaving is easier. Less shampoo used means healthier hair. Also, when a teen gets wet it is easier to style their hair if it is short. Shaving does not hurt the hair.<n><n>Input: What is the value of the dollar compared to a child?

Z*54.20 B. 49.45 C. 40.11 D. 32.05 =<<4+4=54>>54<n>Now we will do the same thing using Zach's friend Charlie and his money.  Zach is saving his $50, Charlie and his mother are saving $50.  Zach's parent is giving him a toy to give his friend.  Zach earns $0.50 per $1.00.  Charlie earns $0.30 per $1.00, and Charlie has $33.20.  What is the final answer now?<n>Output:C. C. 49.35 Z.

They will need $20 each to pay for 2 days at Camp Slocum.  Zach has $20 left but Charlie needs $20.   Zach and Charlie will now get a combined $21.   If Charlie earned $21, Zach will earn $15 of money for being a good friend.  They only need to earn $10 now to cover camp and their transportation and so that they can use $20 for transportation.  This week they have $10 and it only takes them $5 to pay for transportation.  Therefore, they will earn $10 from Zach.  They will pay for transportation and camp, plus transportation after both of them earn more money.<n>Output:A*D*D+C.C.49<n>Let's try it again.  Zach is going to the mall after work to look around.

She spends nearly half of her free time riding a bike.  The day after school started, she decided to be more active and ride her bicycle around town.  At the end of the school day, Mrs. Jones gave her a bicycle with a special helmet accessory that doubles as a reflector and a handbrake.  Mae rode her bicycle along a busy road.  When Mae got to the middle of the road, she stopped.  Her bicycle got stuck in a hole in the traffic signal and she fell off.  Her bicycle was completely bent to the point that it was unusable.  A boy from school saw the situation and tried to help Mae un-bend her bicycle using his pocketknife.  His pocketknife slid down a metal wire attached to a bell that hangs inside of her bicycle's wheel.  The metal bell rattled whenever someone reached for the bell.  The little girl was completely terrified and screamed every time she was knocked off the bike.  At the end o the day a group of neighborhood kids helped lift Mae off of her bicycle.  Her bicycle still was completely bent.  The neighbors also had the opportunity to look at the little girl.  They were all very impressed with the determination that Mae showed to get herself back on her bicycle despite the terrible injuries that she sustained", "answer": "A: gain weight"}

Output: Ricky chose to save his money (which was $0) from his allowance. He now has $4 in his account, $5 on each pay and $3 on each video game.

So the question is: Ricky spent $5 on each game, $10 saved to charity and saved the remainder of his money. How much money will Ricky need to spend when he finally gets his money? Output: Ricky will spend $10 minus 2 (since he only needed $5). $5 left in allowance = $5/10= $10. So Ricky spent $4.25 before paying bills, $4.25 after (paying for his own video game) and $3 after paying bills. So Ricky spending $4.25 means he put $9.25 in his pocket.

It was a bit of an uphill battle convincing them that two stores is called a \"block\".\n\nAnyway, this is a fun game to play, just keep playing until we are all wrong.\n\nI don't think its that easy to explain \"ice cream\".

The answer is C: It would be very hard to create an even surface on the moon, because the moon is a body rotating around an axis.\nOutput: The moon is not even and neither is our planet Earth.  For one, our planet rotates around a large axis.  Furthermore, as our planet is rotating around a large axis, the distance from the sun to the edge of our planet will actually increase as we get closer to the edge of our world.\nInput: Earth contains approximately 50,000,000 objects that are smaller than our planet.  By comparison, the surface of the moon alone contains billions.  How can this affect anything on the moon?\nOutput: Earth would be even and the moon would not because, Earth experiences an angular momentum and moon does not.\n\nInput: It is common for young dogs to lose their coats early.

They both agree that it was about 6300 years ago but they dispute whether people were still alive in this time period. Adam suggests writing it on the whiteboard.\nOutput: On the whiteboard he writes 6300 - 24 = 45, which shows that some people were still alive. The Bible shows that people were living in the last few months of their life around this time period and were killed after they died. When they were alive, they had children.

Remember that for each assessment we work on new content so it's best to work throughout the week, not just the first time.\n\nLesson 1-The Lesson Plan\n\nWe will begin with an overview of the standards and questions that we will be asked to demonstrate your ability to write short responses and to answer a series of comprehension questions. These questions do not require you to completely review each paragraph in response to their answers. They simply require you to answer for each paragraph to show your knowledge of the text and to write some basic strategies for writing. The responses will be graded on whether they demonstrate any understanding of the text and whether they use some of the strategies described in the lesson plan. Your grade will be based on your ability to correctly answer at least one response question and your overall grade will be based on how often you complete all three activities (writing some responses, answering one or two questions, and completing all three activity.\n\nYour overall grade can change based on each of your overall performance.

The example that the math teacher gave was to take the dollar amount of money needed for a new product. So, the student would take the last amount needed plus the 1. But we need to start at the beginning of the dollar amount and add them together. I used an actual dollar amount at the end and that will help us understand the idea. The student would add a dollar amount to the right of the dollar amount in the math question. Then, add that to the left of the dollar amount in order to get the last number of total dollars needed for the product. Now he can solve the problem with the number of dollars he has left plus the sum of the amount of dollars needed for the new product. Since he is working from the beginning, I want him to make sure to add everything together then solve the problem based on his work and math skills. I then have a final problem to do but it does not require the answers. The final problem is that my class must answer this question and we are allowed to choose three questions we want to answer so we chose this one.\nWe are allowed to choose three items to answer each question and they can be 2, 3, 4, or 5.

{"text": "The spoiled child's home was big and had many rooms.\nSubstituting for the parent's allowance of $5 a week does not change the total, the total is still $5.\nSince the spoiled child's playroom has only one room, his household is composed of 4 people and therefore it must have a total of 4 rooms.\nThe only thing holding his family back from a larger household is his allowance.\nThe spoiled child's play room is big so it must have at least one play area.\nThe spoiled child is having a very difficult time saving money for a bigger house since he does not have to buy much in the first place.\nThe spoiled child has more than 4 rooms, so it must be his home.\nThe spoiled child made the right choice.\n\nInput:Zach's total allowance is $40. Zach is saving it to take a gap year.\nOutput:Zach's new year's budget is $40-$40= $<<$40-$40=8>>8.\nThis week Zach will earn $20 from babysitting and $15 from having a haircut.  In total, Zach earned $35 and put $8 of it toward his gap year, so his total is $40.\nBecause a haircut is less than $5, it will be easy to spend $40 and Zach will just have to save more to get his hair cut more than twice a year.\nThere are 8 children in his house and they add up to $40.  He has a total of $80 for the year.\nHis total allowance will still be $40 unless he earns $15 more than week.  Since Zach only earns $20 per week, the total he must earn is $40= $<<$20-$40=4>>4.\nWhich is correct?\nInput:Mary and Zach have an argument. Zach says that Mary does too many dishes every week. Mary says, \"Why don't you do more?\" Zach says, \"Because I have to wash them all myself.\"\nOutput: Zach says, \"I do dishes once a week because I like it better than in school where we had soap and paper towels.\"\nSince Mary's household has 4 people, the total number of dishes she does is 8.  Therefore, Mary has done more dishes each week than Zach.\n\nInput: Zee's is making $150 this year. The allowance is $20 a week.\nOutput: Zee will earn between $160", "answer": "A: big house"}

She uses 7 large stickers on the front cover of her journal and 2 large stickers each to 12 other pages.  How many stickers does Mary need to have remaining?\nOutputs:Mary added 14 stickers total to the 11 other pages minus the 3 large stickers.\nSo Mary added 7 large stickers + 13 stickers = <<7+13=18>>18 stickers to the 11 other pages.\nIn other words, she has 89 - 18 = <<89-18=33>>33 stickers left since she started with 89 stickers.\nAlso from the questions in this section of the exercise, we learned that most questions had a positive or negative value.  If the question asked if Mary would have 89 stickers when she returned her decorative light source or if the question asked if she would have 89 stickers or 89 stickers and an object in a different place from the decorative light source in her possession, how many stickers does the question ask Mary?  In other words, how many stickers is it likely that Mary will have left when she returns the decorative light source and an other item?

Which one of his 4 meal plans he can order online?\nOutput: John will spend $5 on food for 4 meal plans and save $10 for his 4 meal plans by purchasing two groceries at a value of $6.75 per person\nThe 2 grocery option option will take $36.74 off of John's weekly grocery cost. His soda will cost $2.25 from the online option. A total of $43.50 will be left over. So John will be spending $23.15 on the grocery option for meals, $6.75 on the soda option and $33.25 on 4 meal plans.\nInput: Mary is very concerned about the cost of her hobby.

All you can do is pick up all the fallen leaves.  To pick up these leaves, you'll need some long sticks and a few twigs.  Why do you need these sticks?

Zach picks up 4 leaves and then has to pick up 8 total leaves.\nThe amount of leaves he needs to pick up is 4! - 5 leaves + 8 leaves = 4, therefore 4 = 14 * 14 = 56 leaves.  Zach needs to fetch 56 leaves from the woods to have enough for himself.  He only needs 24 to finish his task.\nThe amount of time Zach has to retrieve this number of leaves is 1 hour = 14 hours\nNow Zach only needs 4 more leaves to be able to plant a tree.\nThe total amount of leaves Zach needs to pick up is 8 *(28-4) = 24 leaves.  This leaves him with an extra 12 hours of time, leaving Zach at 18 hours to plant the tree before his allowance ends.\nThe final number of leaves he has to pick up is 18 * (24-5) = 3 leafs * (24-5 - 4) = 7 leaves.\nOutput: In total Zach picked up 4 leafs.\nSince Zach picked up 14 leaves, he has 28 leaves to plant a tree with.

What part of his school budget will he be focusing on most in the short term?\nOutput: Z will focus on computer science and computer store at school in the short term.\nSo in the short term he will need to save up $8.00 + $8 = $8.60\nIn the long term he will need to spend $8.00 + 1% = $8.10\nIn summary:\nThe weekly earnings are 5% x 4% = $0.27 x $24\nSo the final total is $0.26 rounded up to $0.28\n\nOutput: Z is saving up pennies to buy a laptop.  A penny is spent per year, so what is the most appropriate amount of pennies to spend for a laptop?\nOutput: Z chooses $10\nSo this week Z spent $10 + 10 pennies = $80.50\nAnd spent $10 in a savings account = $20.60\nThis week he has $80.50 and no savings account is available = $80.50 x $20.60 = $240.60\nSo in this week\u2019s budget, the computer is worth $120", "answer": "C: computer science"}

What happened in the 4 hours and what is Amber's response to the question?  Answers: A: Amber left the house B: Amber stopped running\nOutput:\nAmber now has $12.50 left in her wallet and $3 in her pocket.  Her father made an extra $100 out of this. He can also help her decide what to spend her money on\nCouple of things I notice: (1) Amber's pocket has $3 and $12.50.  That's an average of $2.50 each in her pocket.  This is significant because $10 in spending money is $20 per trip. You need an average of $40 to get from home to school on a school day (round your city's travel cost to $40 and multiply by city time)  (2) If she did not get in trouble, her father probably got in trouble.  That is, he got arrested and he may be fired.  That would be a loss of $40, which if he's unemployed would be more like $500 than if he's working\nThere is an upside to running away.  If she stops running and does nothing for 4 hours she'll get arrested for running away  There is a downside to running away.", "answer": "E: evil"}

D no\nThis week, Zach received only 3 C's which was his worst week so far.  As a result, he didn't earn enough as part of his allowance to pay for his bike this week and he's upset.

He needs to spend $100 on all of them. What percentage of the list is needed for him to buy all of the items of the complete list?\nOutput:  $100 - $100 + $100 = $93.  If he buys all the items on the complete list, he will have enough money to pay for everything on his second list.  So the final answer is 93 - 93 = $<93>$93\nLast week Zach received only $30.  This week he received $30 for helping with mowing the lawn again for a total of 3 mowing jobs.  He plans on spending $93 on the complete list which will allow him to spend $92 on the second list.  So total answer is $93 - $92 = $<93>93\nThis week Zach spent $30 on 3 more jobs total that he only received $30 for.  With the $92 left on the list, he does not have enough money to use for a second list.  So he will not be able to spend the minimum on the second list.\nSo Zach's total will be $$62 instead of $93 which is only $6 less than his total from last week.\nTotal spending this week is $56.  Zach spends $$9 more than last week.\n\nInput:A teacher wants her students to make an impact on the world instead of sitting around waiting for it to change.

His parents don't like the idea and they've offered him half of their garage as a place to live.  The garage is being renovated and the plan is to finish up this year and rent the garage to a friend.  The student has been putting off the move but now the garage is complete and the student will move in and live in the basement.  He's asked his parents for some financial support.  His father feels that the student should have to work part time to cover his bills in order to live on his own.  The father also feels that the student should take a full load and continue his education in order to afford a part time job with benefits.  His mother thinks that the student is not motivated enough to be making enough money to pay for his own rent/utilities/insurance/etc and thus should take some more from his parents.  Who do you think is more entitled?\nResults: The student has not paid his share of bills since his parents did not foot the remainder.  He has not been contributing to his studies and as a result, he has dropped out.  Therefore, he has not contributed anything to his family except the gas he drives to and from work and the food he buys.  His parents are still obligated to pay for half of his college costs.

Since he will be sleeping on the farm, it's safe to say that his parent's house is a little uncomfortable.  At least his room is a big room, but it's a tad small for him.  The student gets off easy because his parents allow him to borrow a bed from a couple of friends so that his room is as big as he needs.  The other roommate doesn't get off so easy.  Since his room is too small to comfortably sleep in, he won't sleep in his own bed with two other people.  He sleeps on the couch.

The 3d is next to the 2d. The 3d also has 2 dits stars near. It also has 2 other stars near it. Let's use the 3d as a reference point. Using a 2d star, we know that it is next to The 2d, is in the same constellation and has 2 dits stars in its sky. I want to say that my guess of 2deg is correct. That makes it a little bit too close. Let's use the Sagittarius 3d star as our reference. This star is 12.4 deg away. It is also in the same constellation as The 2d. The Sagittarius 3d now has 2 dits star near, 2 dits stars on the other side of it, as it's sky. This star is 12,4 deg away from the sagittarius 2d, it is not in", "answer": "E: solar system"}

Zach earns $40 because he only earned 1 hour babysitting and Jane earns $32 because he only earned 1/2 hour babysitting.  He earns $40 to $40 = 56 to 64 dollars.

Mary and Bethany each had 1 cat. They would take them out almost every day because the mother and husband both had to work and Bethany was the oldest and couldn't take the cats everyday. Because of her younger age, Bethany would have to work more hours than Mary. Zach and Bethany would both earn $8 each.\"\n\"Jane and George decided to have 1 cat. Zach was to stay home at the same cost as Mary but for less hours. He would save $1 a day and Mary would earn $8. Bethany earned $7 from being a baby sitter.

When Michael's parents were moving from their old house to a new one, they said that Ollie shouldn't go.  Ollie ran away and fell in love with a famous actress and she married him.  She gave Ollie money to move to Hollywood and Ollie went and lived in LA for a while.  He decided he liked the big city and came home, but he never learned the language.  So he settled down in NYC and worked at some fancy clothing store that sold clothes from all over the world.  He had lots of friends and some beautiful ladies.  He eventually married the actress that he loved and had 2 children.  He had them both stay with him in NYC because his parents couldn't afford to take care of them.  In the end, both of his children became famous.  The story of the boy had been written by two others, one of them was William Shakespeare.  A book of poems was published in England a few years ago and one of the poems was called \"A Boy Called William.\"  Since the boy was a famous poet and the other poem was about him, some people thought they were related and decided to kill Ollie.  They thought of different ways to kill him.  They thought of shooting him in the head, stabbing him in the back, or shooting him in the mouth.  Some decided they would drown him by throwing him into a river.  Ollie was killed in the bathtub when his wife came home.\nOutput: Michael got to write a poem of his own, since Mary also made the story (The Man in the Mirror) but wasn't as good of a writer as William Shakespeare,\nThis week rumors of goblins killing villagers could cause what?

(Choose one)Answer: Get a music stand to stand the piano up and practice every day.Practice your music as much as you think you suck at it, and try to make sure it sounds good too.

Her parents both agreed that they should go ahead and get them.  They then discussed that she could use her allowance to pay for them.  She was also interested in getting a belt for her backpack and wanted to purchase the $15 that was going to be used to buy it.  She also wanted to buy another bag to put her extra pencil cases in.  She started saving her money from the allowance, but decided that perhaps she could just use her allowance for these purchases.  She ended up spending $30 on the glasses because she kept buying herself more pencil cases, and the purse because she used more of her allowance on her backpack. She also bought a brand new jacket because her car broke down, and her parents decided to buy some clothes for her to wear with her new jacket.  Finally, the bag she paid $15 for has not arrived and was not included in her parent's budget for shopping.  So she used the money on three other items.  She used the money her parents agreed to pay her to pay for the glasses, the bag and the coat.  So, in total, she used $30 on three other things.  This week, she paid $20 to have her parents buy her the sunglasses.  Now she only has $35 to spend for the remaining $14 in her allowance.  Her parents should not purchase her new shoes because her parents have been paying for her shoes for a long time.  The other suggestions would be more useful options.  This week she only pays for the sunglasses, the bag and the jacket.  So she has spent $35 = <<3+35=46>>46 on the things that she thought would come in handy.  Her parents should be more useful suggestions.

When you put together the lines, do you see any reason why that word should be bold?\n\nI'd argue that it fits in well with the other answers given to the questions before it.\n\nIf I wanted to describe the size of the crowd I would say people are far more closely bunched against the wall. But, I would probably not bold the word field.\n\nBecause of that I don't really believe you used \"field\" to describe the crowd. I believe you instead used crowd.\n\nI want to try it (and the others) the first day. I have been pondering this question ever since.\n\nI believe I'll go with the \"field\" example, if I can come up with a reasonable answer for why it would work out like that.\n\nI don't think anyone should worry about how the \"elements\" are represented in the sentences. \"Field\" and \"field\" work well in one form of the other, and you'll eventually have two nouns that fit the pattern and act similarly.\n\nIn the meantime, I have a question for the group: Are you sure in this specific case the crowd is in a particular way to be described by a particular pattern?\n\nI agree it wouldn't necessarily work in this specific case, however I would say that the \"elements\" of the \"field\" in that case would not work together, for one the \"elements\" form a distinct pattern. But, they are all elements in the general sense of the terms - elements of the crowd. The people gathered by the crowds represent a particular group of people, those at the center of the crowd represent the larger group.\n\nBut - again - in the larger sense of the term \"elements\" - they all form a different pattern that does not fit. The crowd has elements of the crowd - yes, but it's not a pattern that fits this particular group.\n\nSo that I guess brings us to the actual answer...\n\nIf the answer is no one should worry about how the elements are represented in the sentences as the answer is, on average, that the sentences in this example do all fit.\n\nBut in some very few cases you may find where a different answer fits for some reason.\n\nI want my students to start", "answer": "C: small group"}

He became obsessed with the fear of cooking so he created a book full of recipes detailing how to cook specific things safely.  He also developed a fear of cutting his own hair.  This led him to cut his own hair to avoid the fear of injuring himself in case of an accident.  He then began hiding his true feelings so he was able to keep a facade of a normal life.  He started this obsession with food by trying to eat through a straw.  The straw would be the safest way for him to eat but he would occasionally make a mistake when eating with it.  He would then feel really gross after eating. People noticed that he was so obsessed with food that every time he ate, he would have such extreme anxiety that he started to suffer from severe food poisoning.

Add that answer to the output of the first question and you'll get the last answer.  The output of the second question is more complicated.  However, it is still an answer.  Add all the answers in turn and you'll get the final answer.\n\nI've never done any of these.  It's your call.  Do you need them or not.  We can decide that and make it official by voting on whether or not we need them.    Feel free to share them around or to make up your own.  I was going to make a few but I'm not sure how to vote..  If it's fine to vote on any of these we will.\n\nThe first thing you need to understand is that the first two instructions don't actually say anything about where you've got to throw the rocks.  You need to understand how rock slings work or else you'll end up maiming yourself\n\nWhen I first started with Rock Slings, the first thing I did was try to make a list of rocks to throw.  Unfortunately, my list was quite large and didn't fit on each page.  Fortunately, I was able to get 2 pieces of paper together and hold them in my hand at the center of the desk to form my rock slings.  If you don't have a paper that fits between your knees and your palm you can always just use a book.\n\nThen I took 2 pencils and drew small circles around my list.  After drawing the circles that would make my slings, I was able to push the pencils through the center of the circles and hold the pencils together.  Using my other pencil, I drew 3 smaller circles on the opposite side of the original circles.  I could have used the last pencil but that only took up one pencil!\n\nNext I drew 3 parallel rows of circles where I would set up the slings.  Each row was like an \"X\" and the point was where the 2 pencils would meet.  That line would follow the pencils and I would use the pencils until each piece of paper was exactly in one row.

People ARE going to have to go out to eat at least once a month, or every couple of weeks, during their stay, in order to get food. Therefore, the location to find food will most likely be in the B-category.\nInput:If Mary was to purchase 2 new outfits, she would have $49 left.  If she bought 1 new outfit, and Mary went home with 2 extra outfits, she would have a total of $109.50.\nOutput:If Mary were to purchase 1 new outfit and Mary went home with 1 extra outfit, her total would have increased to 99.50. Now, Mary has 2 extra outfits and only $59 left to spend.\nSolution:\n* Mary bought 2 new outfits = $159.50\n* Mary wore both outfits and wore them both at the same time = $101\n* She wore 1 outfit and wore it alone = $59\nSo each new outfit she bought would only be worth $59.25\nThe total of 49.25 = $59.00\nNow we need this money taken from her checking account, and the amount must be spent before 2/19.  Our options are, either:  1:  Mary gets $59 back by spending the money on Tuesday so she can spend the rest of the money on the other expenses listed above (i.e. mowing the lawn on Saturday).\nSolution:  * Mary spends the money Tuesday: The $59 refund remains in her checking account and will be deducted from her checking account on the 19th.  Therefore, no money will be transferred to her checking account before 2/19.\n* Mary buys 1 new outfit: The new outfit is worth $59 so Mary will get the whole $79, so she does not need it transferred to her checking account on Tuesday.\nThis solution is still worth $59.00 to Mary. Since she needs the $59 to buy 2 clothes and has already saved $65, the new outfit is worth $49\nTherefore, the solution is:\n* Mary spent $49 and received $59 back from the checking account.

A week of work puts her at $57.\nSince she started working full time, she's earned $57 from $45 in her paycheck.\nSince $57 = $<<57=55>>55, she's earned $59 from her account.\nIn total she earned $55, $19 from working for her parents and $19 from the pen from Dollar Store.  She will need to earn $19 more from the pen to buy the sticker.\nSo the final total is $49 and 3 stickers\n\nInput:Mary worked for her parents on Sunday so she could buy a pen. Mary also worked at the Dollar Store on Saturday to earn $1.25.  What is the total amount Mary needs to earn to buy a pen?\nOutput: $1.25\nSince Mary earned the same amount of money between her two jobs, we get 2*2*2 = $1\nSince the total she's earned from her check that far is 2+2 = 4\nSince both sides of $4 = 2, 4 means Mary is owed 16 stickers\nSo the final total for stickers is $16!\n\nInput: A: Mary did not have any school, after school, or summer activities planned.

She uses 3 large stickers on the \"front page of her journal\" and 7 stickers to other pages, giving her total of 89 stickers available.  Her parent will pay her an extra $10 to \"mow the lawn.\"  How many stickers does Mary get? Output: Mary added a total 5 stickers/page * 7 pages = 55 stickers to the 6 other sheets.  As mentioned earlier, Mary has 89 - 55 = <<5+55=44>>44 stickers remaining. She adds a total of 11 stickers/page * 56 pages = 53 stickers to her journal. Since she started with 89 stickers in her journal, she has now added 53 - 55 = <<5-55=42>>42 stickers. Her total remaining sticker count when adding up all the pages to one sheet is 55 * 56 = 110 stickers.  How many cards is she holding?\nOutput: Since Mary started with 89 stickers, the total number of cards is 110 + 11 - 55 = 130 stickers.

Others may need to explain to you what happened, so you will need to be patient and respectful.  Remember, you can try, but chances are most people will prefer it if you explain everything to them.\n\nSolution:  A: Communication:  Answer: A. This emotion has nothing to do with the breaking of a leg. B: Suffering:  If your friends did not notice something was'slightly off', you should be able to explain the event. C: Pain:  You should ask other people questions/express help. D: Laughter:  You will want to laugh and express that you are not upset.\nE: Embarrassment:  You may have to explain the event.\n\nComments:  A. Communicating:  The person falling in front of a crowd might be a bit embarrassed because a lot of strangers can see that something is wrong.  The reason is that most strangers may be the same size or just as you - the reason that you can see them is probably because it was a big crowd and the light is reflecting off them.  B. Suffering:  If you cannot explain everything, ask other people what you should do.  C. Pain:  You may not be able to explain everything to your friends, so the best way to go is to ask someone else's opinion.  D. Laughter:  If you can not laugh through the pain or embarrassment, you might want to share your pain with others.\nE: Embarrasment:  While you don't want to show that you are embarrassed, you also don", "answer": "E: embarrassment"}

What happens next?\n\nInput: What is the name of the school?\nOutput: High school\nI need to understand an equation.  I know that it takes 4 hours to earn 2 units.  In 3 hours, I will earn 6 units.  So the equation is 2 units in 3 hours.  I also need to know the number of units that I earn per hour.  The only way we can work that out is by adding to the total hours of activity.  It takes 4 hours to earn 4 units. If you need to earn more than 4 units in each hour, consider adding an extra two units for the extra time.  Let's say you earn 6 units in each hour.  Then the total units earned per hour would be 6 units + 4 hrs = 6 + 4 = 8.  So the problem is 8=10+4=12.  I will add 2 units and say that it gives 12 units, and since we can work 10+4 for 12, that means we will have 12 hours to earn an average of 26 units per hour, which is 10 units per hour * 4 hours/2=4.\nInput: 4 hours to earn 2 unit.  2 units to earn 3 units.  3 units to earn 4 units.  3 units for 4 hours to earn... 2 units = 16 hours.  12 units * 36 hrs/12 = 52 units of activity.  10+4 * 12 units = 32 units per hour = 30 units per hour * 36 hours/36 = 48 hours\nOutput: 8 units*48 hours = 32 units = 16 units (per hour) = 5 units of work on the day\n\nInput: Bob and Mary are going back to high school to change their careers.

{"text": "Acceptance * 15 (15 being the most likely)\nIf he got an acceptance, he wouldn't have to worry about not having all the qualifications, and getting an appropriate position would be much more likely.  He's also not worrying about the interview anymore because he has all the jobs for which he needs the most experience.\nIf it's rejected and he has to go back on the wait list, it sucks, but it's probably not the end of the world either. You'll get the job eventually, and it will be better than the jobs you had before you got rejected.  He'd rather have a job he really wants than a job he could be glad he got even if it meant lower pay, especially if he has to be a bit more desperate to get it than he would if he just applied everywhere.\n\nWhen you take the above information into account, it seems like it's likely that he will get accepted if there are available positions still (or very few).  If there are no openings and nobody has called him, they'll likely call him back eventually so they can have an honest discussion about his job application.  But this also has the potential that he'll just find something else and continue to hope it's not an interview, but if he just gets denied because there are no openings, he might as well go back to waiting a few weeks until there's a better chance at an internship.\nOn the flip side, if he's interviewed and he gets the job he wants, then that means the interview went well, and he's got more work to do while in school.  In that case, it would be less stressful than going back to the wait list until he's able to find a better job.\nEither way, if he does get the job, he's got work to do and he's going to need to work hard at finding the time necessary to get the work he wants doing by when he's finished school.  If he waits to find a better job while in school, it's likely that that job will just be worse than the current one, so it might be better not to start working while he's in school.\nOne last thing, he should probably save up his money before the interview because he might need it to get started on the job search.\nOverall, he's likely going to be better off working than going back to school if he has to wait a while until the job is available.", "answer": "B: rejection"}

He asked his neighbor to do the same.  Seth asked his neighbor how much he spent his own money to buy books for his kids.   The answer:   Seth asked his neighbor $5.  Then, Seth asked his neighbor how many books his kids bought.  The answer is $10.  So the total of each neighbor's money is $10 + $5, $50 = $60.  Since they bought books together, the final answer is $90.\nSo the final number the neighbor asked was $90.\nBut before this, both Seth and his neighbor asked their parents to spend money for their children.  Seth's mom bought $80 and his dad gave $80.  This is the total of $80 + $10 = $80, so it is $80 that the neighbor asked each parent.  That total is then added together to $80+$10 = $80.  This total sum is then divided between $80 and $10, $80 is divided equally between $20 and $20, and $10 is divided evenly between $20 and $10.  $40 remains, $40 divided equally among $20-$10 = $40 $40 - $20 = $40 $40 divided evenly among $80-$20 = $40.  $40 divided equally among the other choices is $40.

What's the best color to scratch the ticket?\nOutput: What color are the most likely numbers drawn this Friday?\n\nFeedback:\n\nTo help the students get a better understanding of their own money situation, I chose 4 scenarios.  In each, we would ask them to estimate how long it took them to save their money.  They would then have to find out, how much money they would need to save to win the money that the lottery would reward based on their predictions.\n\nI found that in at least some scenarios, they came up with surprising answers.  For example, their estimated saving time for the most likely numbers drawn was 5 minutes.  On the other hand, some students would estimate that it would only take them one minute.\n\nI found the following examples, that illustrate the point, to be helpful:\n\nCase #1: Scott lives 50 miles away from his parents home and has no dependents. We ask him, how much money from his allowance can he save if he buys a scratch-off ticket and wins $100? He estimates, 50% of his allowance that he got on Thursday.  The math seems a little on the low side, but what should we use to estimate how much money he would need for 5 minutes in order to play the lottery?  One minute of play time = 50\u00d7.4 =.$4.40 so we use $4.40 x.5 = $52.40 as our figure.\n\nCase #2: Scott has an allowance of $30.  From his sales job, he earns $100 per week on average.  He says that at worst, he'll need to work for a couple of hours on his birthday, so his time-to-win ratio is 7 minutes.  So what is the most likely time frame to win the lottery? We chose 20 minutes as the highest probability.  Based on Scott's answer, what do we estimate from his estimate? I added an extra 10 minutes in order to make him estimate a little closer to 8 minutes.  We use Scott's estimate to estimate, how much money he would have to save in order to win? We then use his prediction of how many minutes it will take him to save this money to calculate how much total he will", "answer": "D: pool hall"}

She spent $50 to buy a $300 vacuum from Sears.  The model also included $75.  The vacuum comes with a $500 power tool.  She also bought $20 in accessories.  Who will make more money, Jenny or Sally?\nOutput: In store purchase, $50 to $50.00\nOut of store purchase, $130 to $130\nJenny made the purchase in store and Sally bought it outside\nSo Jenny makes the purchase in store only and Sally buys it out of store\nSo Jenny only owes $200.00 in total and Sally only owes $150.00\nSo the final answer $200.00 - 150.00 = $200.00*100.00 = $250.00\nThe purchase from Sally was done on Friday before school\nSally's household budget is $700.00, so the purchase would only leave $300.00 left.\nSo the family has a budget of $700.00 leaving $500.00 for their weekly allowance.  If Jenny saves $10 from each new purchase she will earn $160.00 in savings each week.  Sally's household budget is $420.00, so $250.00 to $270.00 left of her $700.00 to spend.  Sally will earn $160.02 in total in savings every week.\nSo the net benefit of saving for both Sally and Jenny would be $160.00, so Jenny is now saving 60% more than Sally does.  Next year Jenny will be buying for Sally, Sally's going to have to keep selling her to make up for it.\nSo the final net benefit of saving for Jenny will be $160.00 and Sally will have to spend 40% more than she already does.\nThe family will have $140.00 left of their $100.00 allowance each week when they need it for other needs.\nSo Jenny can save an extra $10 next year to put aside for Sally.  Next year Sally will not be able to keep her old spending habits.\n\nInput:Jack decided to buy himself new shoes.

A motorboat is a vessel that helps propel a ship.\n\nInput: The helm moves a boat.  A boat is a vessel that sails by pushing the steering rod with his left arm and pulling the rudder with his right hand.  A sailboat is a vessel with sails to help propel the boat through the water.  A tugboat is a boat by using hydraulic hoses to turn a tug that pulls the hull of the boat through the water, and it also pulls the boat's bow and stern.\nOutput: You can push the rudder with your left hand to propel your boat, or you can pull the hull by using your right hand to push the sails.  Either way, if you push the rudder with both hands using your right arm, you are moving the bow and stern by pushing the mast (i.e. pushing the helm out of the way).  If you push the mast out of the way with your right hand using your left arm, then the steering rod is moving forward, and the steering wheel is moving to the right.\n\nInput:The vessel's sail is an integral part of the vessel's structure.  The size of the sail determines its strength and the speed it sails at.  A large sail is difficult to control.  Smaller sails are faster, yet less maneuverable.  Most sailboats have a single large sail, which is attached to the mast (i. e. the fore and aft \"sails\").  Smaller sailboats can move much faster than a larger sailboat, yet the larger sail must be moved by hand.  Ships are built to move quickly and without the assistance of a crew or other vessels, and in this way are referred a \"mechanical sailboat\", as they are moving without the aid of any human being\nOutput: You can pull your sailboat through the water by pulling the rigging with your right hand, although the sails cannot be moved by simple pull (i. e. you cannot just pull the sail out of the way).\n\nInput:If she sails without a crew, can you push the boat?

How many stickers does Alyssa have remaining?  Which stickers did she not use?  Which 4 stickers did she use?  How many pages do Alyssa have left on her journal?  Which 2 pages of her diary are not on her journal?\nOutput: 90 stickers left = <<90+4=135>>135 stickers\nAlyssa still has the 9 stickers left on her journal and on page 2 on her diary\nIn total, Alyssa used 3 stickers + 12 stickers = <<3+12=30>>30 stickers to write 7 pages on her journal\nSince Alyssa only had 9 stickers, she now has 30 - 3+12 = <<30-3+12=22>>22 stickers left\nSo Alyssa used 3*3 = <<3-10=10>>10 stickers to write 7 pages of her journal\nSince Ayllas 6-14 page total was 40 papers, she has 30+10 = <<30+14=40>>40 stickers left.  This time she will not write any pages. So her total earned total is 40 - 3+12 = 0>>40\nSo the final answer IS 0\n\nThis week we will use two different methods to determine the total earned to each member. First, we'll look at the dollar value of the food. Second, we'll use the time earned to determine the total earned. The final amount will be determined on Saturday.\n\nMethod 1:\nAssume Alyssa and Zach will go to a fast food restaurant. Zach will earn $5 by", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput: A patient in emergency department was complaining about low back pain. The doctor diagnosed her with chronic rheumatoid arthritis. When they checked her for the reason for the lower back pain, they found that she was currently addicted to oxycodone. This was not something new to the doctors, who had seen it before. They prescribed a pain-medicine prescription for her that would keep her on painkillers for the rest of her life. In time, the addiction would wear off and she would be able to return to her regular life, but for now, she continued her habit of taking the painkillers. As punishment, she was sent to see the hospital psychiatrist, who would try to prevent her from taking her pills.

The hospital suggested that they try to induce vomiting, but it was impossible to induce vomiting as the patient was unresponsive.

{"text": "There are 3 categories to choose from.  You choose your first option (A).\n1: Medicine cabinet\nThe cabinet contains the medicine bottles and syringes.  They are all in good condition.  They are neatly divided, and there are labels on the bottles.   Each bottle is labelled with a code.  You can count how many capsules, 1 teaspoon, 1 tablespoon, etc are in each bottle.  You can use these capsules to count how many times you used each bottle that day.\nSelect your second choice (B).  Choose medicine chest\nThe medicine chest has one drawer.  You choose an item from that drawer and put it in the medicine chest.  If you are going to take it home with you from the hospital, do it correctly.  The drawer may be labelled with a code. The drawer may have one medicine capsule in it.   You will need to count how many times each medicine capsule was used or how many times you used a certain medicine at a certain time. For example, to count how many times an antacid was used on an empty stomach, you begin by counting how many empty stomachs you have had.  In this example, I counted empty stomachs when I ate breakfast.  When I felt my stomach begin to upset, I counted how many times a digestive enzyme was used.  When I had a headache, I counted how many aspirin I took.  When I had an upset stomach after waking up, I counted how many pills I took.   When I felt sick, I counted how many antibiotics I took.  The drawer may label the pills as capsules or as tablets. You can count how many times you took each pill. You may also have to count the doses.   The drawer may be labeled as capsules or tablets.  You may use these capsules to count the doses. In this example, we counted how often an antacid was taken.  When I felt sick I counted how many times I used each mouthwash.  When I felt well I counted how often I took each medicine.  The drawer may have one mouthwash in it.\n2: Medicine chest\nThe medicine chest is like medicine cabinet but there is no drawer.

Zach replies 8. Mary replies 12. Mark wants to know how much more work Zach does each day than Mary every day since Mary takes on the additional work.   Zach replies \"I don't think so.\" Mary replies \"He says he mows the lawn more often than me.\" Mark asks for Zach to prove it. Zach refuses.  Mark points to a big red \"D\" sticker and writes it on a piece of paper.  Zach refuses to admit that he mows the lawn every day and writes the \"D\" on a piece of paper to prove that he does not.  Mary gives Zach another chance, but he refuses again.  Mark gives Zach another chance to prove his innocence. Zach says he helps Mary mow the lawn less often than Mary because he doesn't want to mow the lawn each day.  Mary gives Zach a chance to prove his innocence by saying he has only ever mowed the lawn one time.  Zach writes \"I've only mowed the lawn once\" on a piece of yellow paper.  Zach denies that he has ever mowed the lawn even once, and writes \"I only mow the lawn once, because I'd rather sit in the house and read than mow the lawn.\"  Mary takes a red \"A\" sticker instead of what Zach gave her.

Zach asks for Mary's permission to use his written evidence and she gives him permission.  Zach gives Mark another chance to prove his guilt.  Zach says that he mows the yard once.  Mary says that on June 3 Zach mowed the lawn once.  Zach gives Mark a second chance to prove his guilt by saying he only mowed the lawn one day.  Mark takes the yellow, written evidence for Zach to read.  Mark takes one look at Zach's evidence and gives Zach 2 minutes to respond.

{"text": "For most, exercise helps us relieve some of the problems associated with obesity and increases our physical capabilities, allowing us to live a great life\n\nIn a small town near Baltimore, there are many restaurants selling local produce, many of which have their own gardens where employees come in every day and plant things.  If you live in Baltimore, you should know about this.  Many residents also take turns planting stuff in their yards, or in parks, by the public schools, or by other groups.  A local grocery store sells vegetables which also grow on their property.  Most of the vegetables come from \"certified organic\" gardens and are in organic greenhouses.  It's like getting fresh veggies delivered to you every week.  There's also a local farmer who grows apples and a local coffee bean vendor for coffee as well.  There's a farmer's market at the end of all that, too.\n\nI've always been into gardening and I think this initiative is awesome.  I'd definitely like to go somewhere where there is no electricity.  My first attempt at gardening, which was a pretty pathetic green thumb, was so unsuccessful that I haven't looked back.  Of course, there are no organic growers here.  But, at least they are planting fruits (or rather, veggies, but I'll leave that one open for discussion) and vegetables in gardens.  So, I decided to grow basil (to make pesto), tomatoes (to make salsa), eggplant (to make fried eggplant), and peppers for salsa.  The basil, tomato, eggplant, and pepper plants arrived so easily and were happy and healthy right out of the ground.  They were healthy and the basil was strong and green -- it's the only growing plant in my garden.  I decided these plants were good and that I would use them as sources of pesto.\n\nSo, I planted some basil, tomato, eggplan and pepper plants at the end of last week.  I've been working on my tomato plant, and have put a lot of time into the eggplant (which didn't sprout, but the first leaves have started to come off).  I decided to put tomato plant at the bottom of the garden.  The eggplant and basil are in the corners, and I put a pepper seedling (I got it in a box from the farmer's market, but they had just picked it from seed, so I didn't bother with it).

The House of Lords has 2,000 Members of Parliament and a further 2,000 peers.  The combined size of the Houses is about 200,000 people.  How many MPs must be elected into office each election cycle to have a true majority in all parliaments within each country?\nOutput: 650\nIn this question we have a similar arrangement as the United States Senate, we have 535 Senators elected in the election cycle, and we have 435 Senators-Elect.

{"text": "School children receive money.  Parents get money not to be taxed.\n\nInput: Who pays for the air tickets for the group from Germany? Choices: A: the company B: the airline C: the individuals D: The organization E: the government\nOutput: The organization hires an airline company to fly a German group and each member of the group pays for their own tickets.\nThis is a free lunch for the Germans at the expense of the organization.  The German group would purchase $100 at the beginning of February for the airfare and have that money paid for by the airline.  The airline gives the group a $200 plane ticket for themselves.  The Germans take the flight, pay their airline $200, leave from Philadelphia on March 1 and arrive in Germany on March 2.  They each get the $100 from the airline.\nThe $200 is given by the organization, not by any of the Germans.  So the Germans could use it to buy an expensive snack.

They drive back to Philadelphia with John and Alice.  They have to catch the train in the morning, so there is another delay.  On March 6, once they arrive, there is a meeting to plan a day trip to the beach. Zach gets fired and is depressed.  Mary arrives home on March 6 and has the opportunity to meet John and Alice for the first time.  A lot of time was spent together.

{"text": "(C is correct; answer A is incorrect)\nSince papers can't be held together in their current state, it's best to use an envelope to take them out of their place instead of putting them into an envelope.  Use an envelope for a few reasons:\n1. Paper is easy to fold.\n2. When a teacher opens an envelope to grab something inside, it looks like someone had some kind of accident inside.\n3. An envelope keeps things in its place and away from other parts, so it's best to use it to hold loose papers together.\n4.

Some jobs like to be on the frontlines so there really is no reason other than the need to help someone in need that the doctor can't be an accountant.  Sometimes you need to be on the front lines in order too, so it's better to be an accountant.  It seems like the farmer doesn't make enough money per hour so I'd be a farmer too.

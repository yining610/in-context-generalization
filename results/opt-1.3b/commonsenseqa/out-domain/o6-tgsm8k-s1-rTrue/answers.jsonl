Mary and Max need gas cards because it is the end of the months and they are using the gas cards to buy groceries. Will they reach their gas savings goal?  Output: Max used all of his gas cards to buy $50 worth.  Mary used most of a gas card, but saved $15.  Max spent his remaining card at the gas station and Mary used almost all her gas card, but saved less than $50. Both Mary and Max got full gas savings, as they needed $80 each on gas, but only $80 was spent. Mary gained a percentage point, but both were less than their gas savings goal.  Mary saved less because Max has to buy gas cards to spend on groceries.  Max did better because he used his card for groceries, thus more than he spent, thus more gas savings.  If Max wanted to buy $100 worth of gas cards he could do so on a single card and save more by using all of his gas card on a single card.  That would be an unusual case and it would be more interesting for some teachers, because many would have their students buy gas cards on a single card, but use the gas card on different days, so that each different day they saved money. However, they will have to change many rules to allow this, so they may try to have George get more students to use their gas cards in order to save more money.\nOutput: George won't let George and Max use all their gas cards.

If Mary used all of the large stickers that she took she would still have 89 + 7 = 89 stickers left over.  Therefore, she used 47 stickers instead of 47 + 5 = 49 which is a total of 89 stickers, which means that she has 89 - 49 = 67 sticker left over.\nInput:If Mary had 47 stickers plus 65 stickers, she would have 97 stickers.\nOutput:If Mary had 97 stickers + 65 stickers, she would get 65 stickers left.\nSo she is still 3 stickers shy of the total for her 9 stickers in her journal after using all of the small stickers.\nInput: If Mary has 97 stickers plus 65 stickers then she has 67 stickers in total.\nOutput:If she uses 97 stickers+65 stickers, Mary has 66 stickers in total\nSo this question can only be answered with an average of 4 stickers per page.\nInput:George is given two sets of keys to lock up his car.

I get 9 apples in my backpack.\nIf I have $5, then I go to the hardware store and buy one apple for $1 and 9 apples for $4.50 each.

Therefore, the final answer is D\n\nInput: George said he wanted $20.  Tom gave him $20.  George gave it to his mom.  George said Tom gave him $20 three times.  Did George say this three times before he said it four times?\nOutput: No, George told Tom two times before he said four times.  Tom gave George $20 on Thursday.  It was the first time he showed any interest at all in how George's money was being spent.  He later realized this money was for a car.  After Thursday George told Tom that he didn't have time for Tom's games.  George mentioned the car when he saw him again on Sunday and told him that the money was to buy a car.  George told Tom three times that George had $20.  Tom finally told George he would pay him back when he had extra money.  So it took George three times to get the last $20.\nSo the final question is 4\n\nInput: George asked his dad if he could stay out for two hours on Saturday night.  Dad said yes, if George promised not to go into the boy's room.  George said that was fine, so Dad gave George the money for playing cards instead.  George wanted to play cards instead of going to play basketball and said he was going to be gone for only a couple hours.  Dad said that was fine.  When everyone went out to eat, George came home and showed his dad the bill.  Dad said that he had thought of that but told George that he should have stayed out until he paid it off.  George said he would have done that but Dad told George not to.\nOutput: He promised not to enter the room until he was done with his card game. He never went in after his dad gave him the money.  So, George did not tell his dad he would be out for 2 hours because he was doing card games.  He also did not tell his mom that he would be gone only 2 hours because he was going to play cards.\nSo the final guess is 2+2+2+2=5\n\nInput: You must complete a math problem and write your answer in the comments.\nOutput: You must write a number-based reasoning question, based on your own", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

{"text": "If done correctly grooming nail generally does not cause this. Choices:  A  No, but it does cause an injury to the person because it can cause a scratch when scratching another person or pet. B  No, but it can cause an injury to the nail because it may cause stress on the nail or pull on it. C  Yes, but it also requires some skill and patience to finish. D  No, it can damage the pet's fur and skin, and it can cause irritation, but it is not dangerous. E  Yes, but it can cause a scratch on the pet's skin or fur, but it is not usually dangerous. F  No, but it may lead to some irritation.\nOutput: If done correctly, it can cause the nail to grow healthy. If done incorrectly, it can cause scratches, irritation and eventually an injury.\nSo the final question is: If done correctly, should your pet groomed be treated as a health concern? If not, should your pet be clipped regularly to prevent the scratching?\nThe answers:\nA) Correctly\nB) Correctly is if the nail is long and is not attached to the dog's skin. Therefore it does not require an injury or pain for the groomer to remove it.\nC) Correctly is when the nail is shorter than 4 inches. Therefore it requires an injury or pain.\nD) Correctly is if you and your pet's doctor feel that the nail is long enough and the potential for pain/an injury is small enough for the pet to accept. Therefore it does not need to be removed.\nE) Correctly is if clipping is done once a week, once every three weeks and at every appointment. Therefore it does not cause injury or pain.\nF) Correctly is if a person or the pet's doctor feels that regular clipping could damage the nail. When it is done correctly, it does not cause injury.\nHowever, if someone notices that the nail looks bad or is falling off, they may continue to groom that nail until the nail grows stronger.\nThe final question is: Which of these is the correct answer?", "answer": "C: injury"}

You want to know how much will his dad pay for the furnace? If you subtract the old house's value from the value of the furnace, how much money does he need?\nOutput: If you subtract the value of the old house and the value of the furnace + old house's value, you have the amount to spend on the furnace\nThere is the option of subtracting the value of the furnace and value of the house; however, it will only affect how much the furnace should cost because you will be purchasing the unit and you don't know what it was worth.\nThe house has a value of $400,000; the furnace would cost $20,000. If you subtract the old furniture, the purchase price is $10,000, so the purchase price is $20,000. However, the value of the furnace is not known; therefore, the cost of the furnace cannot be determined. Therefore, you will be purchasing the furnace.\nTherefore the cost of the furnace is $20,000 - $40,000 = <<20+40=90>>90\nThe cost of the furnace is 20 * 1,000 = <<20*1,000=360>>360\nThe cost of the floor is $40,000 - $40*1,000 = <<20/360=60>>60\nYou already own the furnace and in order to purchase the floor, you must have 20.\nSo the final price of the furnace is $400,000 - $20,000 = <<160>160\nSo the final answer of $160-$180 - $40 - $40 = <<160-160=180>>180\n\nInput:An apple costs $6.50 - $5.50 if it wasn't sliced and if you ate it whole, otherwise you'd have to chew a lot to get it out.

Finland F: Denmark\nOutput: Sweden\n\nInput:If you want a person to be your assistant manager, you tell them that your job is to buy them things and they will give you things for free. You can have anywhere from 200-400 people. For each person, you say that it will cost you $1,065 a month and they will work for you for the same number of days per year.  The money is yours.  You are only giving them $900 a month because you expect them to bring $2.30 in tips.  If only 20% of the people make tips, you will still get $4,700 a year and only spend $80 a month.\nYou put out a sign that read \"Help Wanted: 50 employees for less than $1000 per month.\"  About 2,500 people apply.  Most of them earn $200-$450 per month and have 2 years of experience in retail. They are hired because they are loyal and they will work hard.  The majority of them have at least 2 years experience because they can prove their worth. When they quit, the store gets 500% of their annual pay. At the end of a year, you want to see if you can cut $2.50 out of your customers bill.  If they do, they will stay around for another year. In the end of each year, you take away 10% of your customers tips. When people quit, they are given 50% of their check.  If you have 2,000 customers, you expect them to bring in $14,000 in tip income. At the end of the year, you want to ask for 100% of your tips from the people that have been with you for at least 2 years.\nHow much money do customers tip you? How long does it take you to make this request? How many people does your store lose in a year because they quit?\nOutput: The first 7 months have about $10,000 in tip income and the last 10% makes up the rest. This means the store will lose 800 people per year.\nAfter this, the store loses around 2000 people but gets 500% of the amount of money from their tips.\nSo there is a 50% profit margin at the end of the first year.\nSo the", "answer": "A: netherlands"}

So the final answer is $ <<11+8=13>> 13 ice cream pieces\nIt took Max 30 minutes to eat all four pieces of ice cream. Since he needed four ice cream cones for himself plus three ice cream cones for his mom, then he would need $24.35\nSo the final answer $ <<11+8<=>$13<<4<<-19>>19 = $<<4-19<=>$12<<27>>27 = $10\nIt took Max 30 and 26 minutes to eat ice cream. Since he only ate two pieces for himself, then he would need to do a total of 4 * ($26 - $10) + ($24 \u2013 $6) = $<<9+12<=>$11\u2013$11 = $<$-10\u2013$-40>>40\n\nInput:In college all four of the following books are required:  1.

Choices:  As each person get closer to age 18, they tend to date different men. The effect is that their age difference increases.\nOutput: As one older man enters a divorce, another younger man becomes his preferred choice.  That choice tends to have a bigger affect on the older man than on the younger man, as the older man's marriage tends to have less financial impact on them.\n\n### Instruction:Answers the following multiple choice question\nInput: Mary and Zach have been married for nine years and have three kids. A divorce takes at least a year to complete, but it will take much longer if the divorce is from the children (younger than age 12) or Zach's parent's (higher than age 12).\nOutput: Mary has 2 children and Zach has 2 children. He has to decide between them which is best for Zach. He has one year left for his divorce from Mary.\nIn the total number of days Zach has left, there are 10 * 2 * 6 = 8 days left.\nHe can either choose to have his divorce from Mary or from Zach be completed within those eight days. So if he chooses to have his divorce from Zach to be completed within 8 days, there are 10 days left for the divorce from Mary.\nSo there are 10 days left.\nTherefore there are 10 days left and Zach can get an equal amount to Mary.\nSo the final total question is 10 + 8 = 12\n\nInput: If Zach and Mary get married soon, the divorce rate in the country doubles. How much more likely is the rate to double with the divorce of a child than with the divorce of a father?\nOutput: There has already been a 13% divorce rate for children under age 12 within the next 10 years.

{"text": "Zoo\nWhich choice is the correct one? A: rain forest B : Zoo C: toy store D : Zoological gardens\nThe correct answer is D\n\nInput: John worked on a project to measure a piece of plastic.  He was to attach a piece of plastic (with a small hole for air) to the wall on the side of a house with two screws.  The hole would have to be on the underside of the piece of plastic.  To ensure the screw holes remained aligned, John would take a cardboard template of the hole he was going to put through the wall, cut it out, and put the template in the screw holes of the piece of plastic he was measuring. He did not attach the template to the plastic, he simply cut the template into the middle of the piece of plastic and placed it in the screw hole.  While doing his measuring, he became distracted and accidentally dropped the cardboard template in the hole.  When he realized what happened, he went quickly back to the wall and carefully pulled the cardboard template out.  After he put the template up again, he used a piece of masking tape to fasten the template to the wall. John used the plaster board paint to finish the wall.  There is one small problem with his finished project. He is unsure if the plaster board paint will stick to the wood and he can not see the paint sticking to the wood.  If he uses a different type of paint, he cannot remove the board and if he uses latex paint, it will not hold and he will need to add more paper paint.  He would like to do a second project to see if he is able to solve the problem.\nOutput: To ensure that the wooden piece is still connected to the plaster board, he put it on the wood with tape.  He used a painter's tape that has adhesive on one side (the side facing the wall), but not the reverse side (where the screw holes are).\nAs he got up to finish he noticed that the plasterboard stuck to the wall by way of the adhesive on one side and the paint on the other side.  So, he carefully took what he thought was the plastic board from being attached to the wall and the glue on one side and pushed it on the wall.  It stuck.  He now has a completed wooden floor.  To continue, John wants to know if he can paint the floor before it dries.  He thinks that it should stick pretty good; he did not put anything", "answer": "D: zoological gardens"}

He plays club soccer this fall and the coach is worried that he isn\u2019t going to make it. What can A do to help him?  A: Coach him B: Play with him C: Give him an extra goal A: Give him an extra point C: Offer him $1,000  The boy has $13,000 and will give $13,000 / $13,000 = $<<13+13=20>>20\nOutput: Give him 10 extra points = $<<10+10=20>>20\nIf all 10 boys do it successfully, the team will score 40 points, but only 8 boys will get extra 10 points. Since 8 boys will score 20 points with 10 extra points, the team has 40-8 = 39 points.\nIf all 8 boys do not score 20 points, the team will score just 16 points, but only 6 boys will get 10 extra points. Since 6 boys will get 8 points, the team has 16-6 = 16 points.\nIf the whole team scores points, the team will have 40 = 9 x.40 = <<40+9=150>>150 points.\nSo the final score is 150-8 = 60 points\nIf the whole team doesn\u2019t score points, the total score will be 40 = 9 x.20 = <<40-20=0>>0 points.\nSince 60-8 = 0 points, the team will not win even though 9 out of 18 boys got 10 points.\nSo the whole team did not win at all.

So while his legs might be tired, they are also tired from getting up and down off the couch for a snack or for a nap. So once his legs finally fall asleep, sex is the only logical solution.\nInput: What would animals do when their legs are cold? Choices:  1: run away 2: stand up 3: crawl 4: run away\nOutput: >  1.  Running away.\n>  2.  Stand up.\n>  3.  Lick feet.\nSo if Max wants to go through the following choices, he can only pick option 1 if his feet are really cold.

He also licks the feet of his dog to help him recover.\nSo his answer is 1 because his feet are cold. When Max gets too cold, he crawls. When Max has time for a snack before or after he runs away, it is running away again.

{"text": "For most of us exercising at a moderately low intensity is good for most of us.  Since resting in the afternoon is not great, we should make a deliberate effort to spend an hour of rest before we exercise so that we have more energy when we do exercise.  Also, some of us need to exercise for health reasons.  Some of us just need some time to get away from social media and other stuff.  If you were to put a price tag on all of this, you probably wouldn't want to pay much less than $10 for a single hour of moderate exercise.  (To find out exactly how much exercise you need in a day, calculate what the cost is, multiply by 60 or 70 or 80 or 90 minutes.  Then divide by 60 or 70 or 90 minutes to get an amount to start with.)\nInput:Arent people who lose weight more likely to be exercising? If so, how many hours of exercise is necessary or recommended to lose 2 pounds a week?\nOutput: Most people should expect to lose 2 pounds of weight in about 10 days of intense exercise with a rest day in between.  With a rest day in between the exercise should add at least one to two pounds off per week.\nInput:Why would you want to exercise today? Choices: A: to lose weight B: to get out of bed and do something else C: to get exercise D: to clean the house E: to work on homework with grandma/grandpa/papa/siblings\nOutput:Exercising to lose weight is a good idea for most people!

The first thing the dog will eat when it awakens is an energy drink so it has more energy to get up and go. The two snacks which are most likely to be eaten are a piece of stale bread and a fresh water bottle. If there is no dry food, then they will most likely snuggle up on the bed to sleep.

Your options are:\n1- sell everything and buy nothing A:  buy a house B:  buy the stock A and A only\n2-  sell nothing and buy nothing B:  buy the mortgage B and B only\nFor the first choice, it doesn't matter which stock to buy because it's the only investment that allows you to buy only 1 stock.  If you only invest $100 per day and then reinvest $100 in a company, it won't even matter which stock to buy.  If you buy A and A only, then you would have $4,000 investment per day.\nFor the second choice, it does matter which stock to buy since it can be the first of your investment because it's the safest investment for you.  If you invest 100 dollars per day then you have a $500 investment and you can reinvest your money every day for 1,000 days.  You can reinvest it all in one company each day.\nThis decision requires that you weigh all your options and determine which investment has the greater potential return, for you, if you reinvest all your money in one company.  However, you can't invest $10,000 per day, so you will have to choose between buying the mortgage and buying one stock.\nYou only have one month to make your decision so choose wisely.  If you sell nothing then you could easily make the wrong decision.  When choosing A or B use a scale of 1-10.\n\nInput: Where are the four largest cities on the planet and their populations?

He has the technology and the computer skills to do that but maybe not with the specific program he needs. So he doesn't think that program is what he needs.  He asked his mom.  She is the one who knows the computer and she suggested that he ask his dad.  He asked dad and they told him it was available for students who wanted to use it in the fall.  He asked his dad again and dad said to ask about it again next semester.  George has been looking online this week about computer programs but hasn't found it. So maybe he doesn't know it's available this fall.  He doesn't know all the computer programs anymore like he used to.  So this is why he doesn't think it's the right program for him at the moment. So I think he doesn't really know the computer programs well this year like he used to.\n\nInput: Max is walking home. He wants a pair of shorts that will keep his cold paws from freezing.

{"text": "A\n\nInput: In math, what number is a negative amount of 10 in decimals?  Output: 3\n\nInput: Let's say that for a while, every night when Max and Zach went to sleep, George went to bed and Mom went to bed.  There are only 8 hours between midnight and 7am. When Max and Zach would wake up, they would hear Mom's alarm clock go off at 8am and know that her day was over and that it was time for Max or Zach's. Why did George turn off the alarm clock every night?\nOutput: If Mom goes to bed every night at 8am and the alarm clock goes off every night between 10pm and 4am at 8am, Matt, George and Zach would only need to wake up about every 3 hours to hear Mom's alarm clock wake them up on the 1st hour of the 2nd and 3rd hours of the day.   So George turned off the alarm clock.\nSo on weekdays, George would only need to get up every 2 hours and on weekends, George would only need sleep for 2 hours.\nSo the final answers is 2 and 3\n\nInput: In high school algebra class, Zach went to a science fair.

Zach lets Mary dictate the articles for each page of her journal? 4. Mary is always doing her writing for Zach, while Zach is always doing his writing for Mary, which is more helpful for Mary.\nOutput:Zach did most of his writing for Mary, but Mary was doing hers mostly for him. Mary kept her journal for herself.\nZach did almost all his writing for Mary because Mary was typing and copying, while Zach was always dictating and making corrections. Mary was also typing all of the articles for her journal, while Zach was dictating articles to her and giving her corrections. They both used their journals the same.\nThe first reason I would say that Mary was doing her writing for Zach was because she had more than 40 entries for a week in a row. This is something that Zach sometimes does and he often types up a lot of notes. This is something that didn\u2019t happen to Mary. So what it really looks like is that Zach was always dictating to Mary while Mary was dictating to herself. Zach had very little input in the writing and this could have been why he didn\u2019t do as good a job making corrections. Zach had more of an influence on the writing and Mary just copied his handwriting, which is less useful for him.\nThis is because Mary typed all of her journal entries and Zach just dictated the articles to her.

In the second period, he had to draw an icicle with a sharp pencil. He drew a picture of an icicle and wrote it in a spiral, but that drawing wasn\u2019t satisfactory. He finished the task and was in the middle of the drawing when he realized that he forgot to take his pencil with him. He searched through his backpack and found his pencil, but he couldn\u2019t find anything sharper than an eraser.  He couldn\u2019t figure out how to use the eraser, so he finished the icicle as a sketch and then wrote the word icicle on the paper. The word made him think of a snowman, so he turned it into a snowman shape.  He put it in his backpack and went outside to try it out. The drawing was good, so the word icicle went well with the snowman.  His friend asked him to describe it, but he was puzzled by his answer. He thought about it some more and decided to keep the icicle, but only as a sketch. \u201cI drew a picture of an ICICLE,\u201d he said. Then Mark wrote the word icicle twice onto the drawing.

His parents are paying him $2 an hour extra as a courtesy allowance. He has just begun babysitting twice week and they expect him to babysit for 30 hours this week. How much extra does Mark need to earn by Saturday for his parents to double their allowance?\nOutput: He needs to help out at least 30 hours this week with the same $2 rate.

Now, I need to ask you for an answer for 1, but I can't find it anywhere or I'd already know it.\nOutput:Since we also have a second edition, and since we know that 1+1=2, and 1+2=3, we know that 2 + 2 = 3. Therefore, 1 + 3 = 1, as in the answer for 1. Therefore 2 + 3 = 6 - (1+3)/2, and in the last solution the answer 6 = 1+6/2, so we get 2/2+6 = 6/2=6\nSince 2/2+6=6/2, 2/2+6 + 5 = 6, and 6/2+6 + 1 = 6, we know 2/2+6+1= 10 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 10. Therefore, 10 + 5 = 3 + 1 = 10 + 3, 4 + 1 = 4, and 3 + 1 = 31. In other words, the answer is 31\nIn other words, you got the answer 30 after three weeks of studying.

{"text": "The apiary I'm going to buy is called Bee's Place. It has a website on it, a beekeeping forum and is a member of the National Association of Beekeepers.  They also list their beekeeping products online.  They're located in the middle of town, within 100 yards walking distance of lots of apiaries so there are plenty of options to choose from.  I'm also a member of the Association of Beekeepers so I know of several apiaries that I could go to from home.  A few other beekeepers are members as well.  When should I go?  Now? Probably not? In November when the bees are in their nesting period? In the spring? In the summer?  Who knows?  So I'm going in the summer.  It will be cool and cloudy so I'll have lots of company.  There are several Apiary Tours so you can get a better idea about where to go, what you'll see and hear and what can be expected.  There is a place called \"Bee House\" in Chicago, IL that does Honey Tours and Apiary Tours.  The Honey Tour can get you started, maybe you'll want to go a bit further and join them and take a tour that they provide, or you can take one they've arranged on your own. However you choose to do it, you'll have a great time learning about beekeeping and what to expect.  I'm also going to join the Apiary Tour I found on line in September.  This is where you get to take a self-guided tour.  There are also Beekeeping Tours where you get a private tour of an apiary and then have a chance to speak with the apiarist yourself.  The beekeeper will tell you everything you need to know about beekeeping from how to identify the different types of bees you'll learn about to how to make a beekeeper's suit.  Here is a link to their website http://mjbeekeeper.com/.  You put in the zip code and I'll return a list of APILIATIVE locations that are within that zip code/area where you can go and have a tour.\nOutput: I've listed the Apiary Tours in bold.

Output: Max had 17+10+8 question so there were 5.2*2=40 questions in his math lesson\nWhen it comes to answering 10 questions, Max has done an average of 6+6 =<<6+6=27>>27\nWhen it comes to 11 questions, Max has done 7 + 2 * 7 = =<<7+2=13>>13\nWhen it comes to 12 questions, Max has done 3*9 = 2*9 + 9 = =<<3*9+9=15>>15\nWhen it comes to 13 questions, Max has done 1*10 = 9 * 1 = <1*10+10 = 4>>4\nWhen it comes to 15 questions, Max has done 2*2 * 2*2\nso when adding up 2*4 and 3*2 you get 1 + 2. so Max gets 5+5 = <<1+1>>5\nWhen you add up 2*4 * 2 * 2*2 you can also do 3*2 = 4 * 1. 5 + 5 = <<3*1+1//3//3>>5\nThere's two more factors of 15 to make for 18 and one more factor of 4. So the overall average is 3.5 + 5 - 4. So 7 in total, 1/5 of the questions\n\nInput: Mary has a book of animals that she has been collecting for several years.

Then he goes and eats 5 slices from the first pizza. He can take the other 20 pieces off the top and put them on the second pizza. He can do this because his second pizza only has 12 slices and he eats all of the pieces in the pizza with the other 20. How much pizza did Max eat?\nOutput: Max took 6 pieces of pizza off of each pizza.

What do you say to a student who asks for $5 more in snack money, but wants more allowances?\nOutput: You are not very tolerant of asking for money.  You are not very tolerant when the student asks for more money.  you are giving a student more money. So because he asks for $5 more, your allowance is $10. But now, because you give him more money, your allowance is $11.  This is because you also said you were giving the student $5 more in allowances and in exchange for allowing the student to get $5 more, he will let you use $5 to purchase the snacks and another $5 to purchase the movie ticket.  Your answer to the student will also be $5 more, but you will give him more money ($25) and the student will only get $30.  You may ask the student to return some of the money received to get another $5 allowance.  You are not paying the student back for having $5 more.

The first option is Write a short message on paper which costs 3 cents. She has the option to spend 3 cents on this because she doesn't have to pay to send the message. The second option is Write a long message on paper plus 3 cents which costs 5 cents. If Sara doesn't pay, she gets the short message and if she pays, she gets the long message. Sara chooses the first option and then has to write her message. The second option means she has to write a long message including the 3 cents. Sara writes her message and sends it by snail mail. Sara is charged a penny to send the message. Sara also must pay for postage because it costs 2 cents plus 2 cents. In total Sara will have to pay 4 cents for the message plus postage.

After his one year treatment the doctors were unable to discover what the pain was.

He told all his friends at school about the pain he was in. But still he didn't want to stay home any longer. He wanted to try going home by himself. He made a trip to the emergency room by himself. When they tried to help, the doctor told Jacob that he needed to go back to the hospital. When they took him back to the hospital, Jacob had to wait two years to be discharged.  By then, Jacob had been in and out of the hospital many other times. To help him prepare for a 2 more year stay, Jacob read the book In The Afternoon Of A Saturday by Frank Lloyd Wright.

Because Jacob had been in the hospital so much, he had the experience of dealing with severe pain 24/7. That experience caused him to learn to deal with his pain in ways that were very helpful to other people.

He must design the plant so that his equipment, including a compressor to handle the gas, is as efficient as possible.\nOutput: 200 x 15 = 400 kg = 320*15 x 15 x 200 x 15 = 640 kg = 320*15 * 160 x 20 = 640 kg\nOn total, about 160 kg of the captured gas, or 33% of the amount in the beginning, is saved because of the low cost of capturing the gas from a natural formation\nSo his equipment must be more efficient in order to get the same amount of energy produced.

{"text": "The answer \"C\" would seem to be the most likely answer for a lot of people, but that is wrong.  Inflation does not actually eat cake, it does not cause a deflation of all the money in the world, and it certainly does not cause \"economic instability.\"  There are several other problems caused by inflation as well, such as higher interest rates (inflation drives up interest rates and money has less purchasing power), but there are many more.\n\nInput: What is the smallest number for which a 10% interest rate will cause a recession? The answer is 5, for the reason that if interest rates are higher than 10%, then demand is suppressed and people will spend less money than they have saved; the increase in the value of money will cause businesses to have fewer customers, creating a recession. (Since inflation causes less money in the money supply, it is not a recession as it is not a decrease in money supply.) The reason that 5% interest causes a problem is that the cost of money is often based on inflation. Many business owners will not be able to borrow money for investment or equipment because they cannot predict the future interest rate so they will postpone buying that equipment and instead save more money.\nOutput: If an interest rate of 10% is causing a 10% recession, then 5% inflation is also causing a 10% recession (since an increase in the value of the money will decrease the money's purchasing power).\n\nInput: Which one of the above statements about the government has the most truth to it?

In fact, changing interest rates through the Federal Budget is a valid answer as well.  Choices (3) and (4) will only hold true if money being printed by the government is not allowed by the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve is not allowed to print \"credit\" or \"debt\" so there is no government power allowing the Federal Reserve to do this.\n\nInput: Which statements about the government are false? A: Most taxes increase consumption B: When income and employment are low, taxes cannot affect consumption C: When income and employment is high, taxes cannot affect consumption D: There is nothing the government can do to lower consumption", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

Choices: A: keeping up with the curriculum B: interacting with the students in the classroom\nOutput: C.\nThe most difficult part of teaching is keeping up with the curriculum because classrooms are large and all the classrooms have similar schedules. Many classes are different so students don\u2019t always have a teacher close by to learn with them.

{"text": "If I thanked you for saying I have done good work, I would\nsay: Your thanks is really appreciated and you were very nice to say.  Please excuse me for leaving and heading to my next class.  Thanks again!\n\nInput: When I play golf, I have to walk as far to reach the ball.  If I walk 10 paces, the ball will take 10 swings to reach.  If I walk 20 paces, the ball can be hit in about 5 swings because it's easier. So, if I hit the ball 10 times with a 10% chance (that's 1.4%) then I have scored more strokes per round than those who shoot better averages. Why is this?\nOutput: If the hole is long enough (90 inches), the ball (with a 10% chance) will hit the fairway and end the round.  If the hole is shorter (45 inches), the ball will only end one hole.  If you go past 90 inches, the ball will not be able to end a hole.\nAlso, assuming you have a 60% chance of scoring a 5 or better (based off your average score)\n5 strokes / 90 = 20\nSince holes are 90 inches long and the average score is a 5, your average score would be =2.5/90 = 2.5\nThen you would only need to score 70 strokes to break the average score\nSo\n2.5/90 x 60 = 350\nSo you would need to score 75 strokes to make your score break the average.\nSince strokes are counted on an average, you would need to score 73 strokes to break the average.\nSo if the round is 4 rounds, you would need to average 65 strokes to make your score beat the average.\nSo the final question is whether or not the round will last 4 rounds, score at a 5 or better average, require you to score 73 strokes or more or not.\n\nInput:When you go to class and the first person is late, you feel guilty for getting upset but can't explain why.

He will earn $500 this month and will receive only $50 in April because he didn\u2019t save anything. He spends $350 per month eating and will leave $350 after selling the house. How much money does Jeff have in his savings?\nOutput: $700-0 = <<700-0=370>>370\n$370 + $50 = <<370+50=580>>580\nSo $580-550 = $470-$470 = <<440-110 = 610>>610\nSo if he buys the house with his earned $470-$470 and saves $550 each month he will have $870 + $50 = <<740-70=740>>740 to spend on items he needs. This will last him until May. He can use the $640 in his savings that he didn\u2019t use in February to pay for the mortgage and utilities. He will have only $50 left in savings.\nSo the final total for Jeff is $70\n\nInput: When is a day without running water more than one day of running water?

{"text": "It would be hard to find planes not being used at the military base. However, air combat is very dangerous, so airplanes could easily crash. So airplanes that have been used as weapons are out of the question. Planes that are being stored for future usage are out of the question; for example, most planes in storage at the airport might still have a few years before they would be ready for use. Also, since planes are expensive, they are expensive to purchase. Therefore, any airplane that could be used as a weapon would be far too costly to purchase. We would be better off finding airplanes that are no longer usable due to repair/upgrade issues. We would then be able to sell these airplanes to the civilian market with a good deal.\n\nOutput: A new baby duck arrives at the duck farm. You can sell the baby duck for $100.

This cost is $120,500.\nSo Max buys 30 new homes at $20,000.  The government pays $20,000 and they agree to build 40 more at $100,000. Max will be able to afford these houses, especially because he will be able to pay the $20,000 for it.\nSo Max and government will have to agree to build 40 more $160,000, $120,500 = $160,000, -120,500 = $120,500\nSo they are still able to afford 75% of the total cost with 20 free homes.\nSo Max and $240,000 - 160,000 + 120,500 = $240,000 + $120,500 =\n$120,500 - $160,000 =\n$120,000 - $120,500 = 120,000\nIf Max was able to find people willing to build a house for $200,000, he could", "answer": "A: bathroom"}

Which one of the following will be the first to go?\nOutput: No one will ask the Chinese table to leave, so they will eat.\nThe Chinese table will put half their plates into the Chinese bowl\nThe Chinese table will take their plates from the bowl and place them into the American bowl. That will leave the same amount of food for everyone else.\nThe Chinese table has twice as much food as the first table which means that they can all share a piece of fried dough.\nThe Chinese table does not have enough food. They will divide their plate into 4 pieces and each will eat one of those pieces. Once they have eaten all their pieces, both dishes will be shared evenly among the other tables.\nThe first table will put their plates back into the Chinese bowl. Now there is no way the Chinese table will go empty again. If the first table starts up again after the second party, the Chinese table will go first again.\nThe Chinese table can eat all of its food before the second party starts in order to keep up the momentum.\nIf the Chinese table wants a piece of bread, they should put their plate into the bowl to avoid the fight that resulted from the first party\u2019s food.\nIf the second party starts eating after the Chinese table, the Chinese table should place their plate into the bowl. It\u2019s unlikely that a fight would start again.\n\nInput: Where do you put your shoes when you are walking to school and back?

One of the balloons rises up about 8 feet with the water inside it. When they try to pick him up, he grabs the balloons and tries to get out of them. The man grabs a pole and pulls him out of the balloon.

There are several types: Life, Health and Disability Insurance. However, only one type is required on the tax form. A portion of your federal tax return is returned for Social Security taxes and this tax is withheld for your state taxes. The state tax is very low compared to other states around the U.S. The state has specific plans for people on Social Security. Which are the most popular, the ones you can find it the bookstore or the ones you have to seek help from a lawyer?\nOutput: It depends. There are many different types of insurance. Each plan has its own specific deductible.\nIf your deductible is $1,000, your insurance plan will cover up to $1,000 of the deductible.\nIf your employer contributes to your insurance, they may include $1,000 in your contribution to your health insurance.  So if your limit is $1,000 then your benefit is $1,000.\nAnd if you are uninsured then the Health Insurance Marketplace will offer you up to 500% of your deductible amount (up to $2,500 in the 2009 tax year).  So it depends.\nSome plans may also include things other plans do not.  For example, plans may cover some maternity services or chiropractic treatment.  And the cost of some dental procedures may be covered.  It depends. Ask your tax preparer.\n\nInput: One time, Mark bought a ballerina for $25.

That technology is this thing called Google. It\u2019s really a pretty cool new thing that promises to give users the opportunity to learn many things right in a browser that, up until this point, has been reserved for only the most specialized learners. The idea, if you\u2019ve been paying attention, is that in the future, as the Internet becomes more widespread, that the entire world will read your articles for you, helpfully annotate your answers, and tell you which way they agree with you. That\u2019s pretty cool, but I want to go beyond that idea into examining some of the specific reasons why digital dictionaries are so desirable and popular. The main reason, I\u2019d argue, is that they\u2019re so convenient. As a society, we are rapidly becoming all about convenience these days and in many ways Google has proven great for this. Whether you\u2019re looking for help with language learning, finding information about a new product or service, or just trying to find a spelling mistake in an article, the vast majority of what you will find on Google is something that\u2019s easy to look up. And that\u2019s exactly the opposite of learning. As technology has gotten increasingly more important people have become more interested in knowing how to use it. While Google is undoubtedly one of the best and most advanced learning tools available, it\u2019s still a relatively low volume of information compared to all the information that\u2019s already in existence.

It weighed 80 grams. The coin was 8 inches in diameter. The coin weighed 3 gram. The coin has a value of 10. Jane has a total of 10 grams. How many grams is Jane left with (the current value of the coin)?\nOutput: Jane has 10 grams of gold. She has 10 grams more weight than the coin because there is less gold to count.\nThe value of the coin now is 20 grams\nIt is worth 10 grams since there is no more weight now\nThere is one gram of gold missing therefore there is now 80 grams\nSince there is not more weight now there is now 80 grams of gold.\nThe current value of the money (20 grams x 80 grams) is 40\nSo 80 grams is now 80\nSo now there is 40 grams of gold\nThis is 30 grams after taking the value of the gold the total remaining value is 160 grams\nSo the final value of the money with the missing weight is 160 grams x 30 grams = 320 grams\nSo the current value of the money with gold is 160 grams x 30 + 320\n\nInput:Jane and her friend were riding their bikes through a forest.

She had to walk home with two pieces of sausage at the same time.  If they took them in separate groups and she took the sausage into the house while another dog took it with her out of the yard and threw the sausage away, how many sausage would the dog eat in the house?\nOutput: Two sausage is 3.2% of the sausage eaten by the dog\nSo if her food is 10 times healthier, because each sausage contains the exact same amount of energy in it, the dog could have eaten 6.1% of the total energy in the dog's food. So the dog had more energy in the food than the dog ever ate.\nSo the dog would be hungry in the house after taking her food in the yard, and she would be less hungry when taking her food away outside.  So \"3.2%\" in the dog's number of energy in the food=1.08% in the dog's number in the total energy in the food, which made the dog 2.5% less hungry than she was at the time she started the first race.\nThe dog won the first race because she was less hungry than other dogs.\nSo in total, the dog could have had 16.6% of the total energy of the dog's food.  Since the total energy in the first race is 17.8%, the dog's second race would have been 33.9% of the total food.", "answer": "D: skill"}

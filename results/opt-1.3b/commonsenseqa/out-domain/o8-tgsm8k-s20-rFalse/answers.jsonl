He has had severe coughing attacks so many times during his time in the hospital that he is starting to lose consciousness. The doctor sends him home. There, the doctor is worried that the coughing will happen again and that it may result in a serious infection. Because the doctor doesn't want the patient to continue coughing, he brings in a nurse to help him. The nurse tells the patient that she will hold his coat, wipe down his hands and arms, and cover his mouth. This helps the cough disappear, but the coughing will get worse. The nurse takes his coat off, wipes his hands, and covers his mouth, but the coughing does not go away and when the nurse tries to leave, she falls to the floor and cannot get up. The patient is brought back into the room on oxygen, but the coughing still won't stop. The nurse can't think of anything else to do and is willing to do anything to help the patient. The doctor is not going to wait around. He wants the patient to undergo a surgery that will remove some tissue in his lung that has broken off. After the surgery is complete, the doctor tells the patient that he won't be able to breathe without a tube in his throat for at least six weeks. It will be a hard process for the patient to go through. Because the doctor hopes this will stop the cough, he doesn't want the patient, who continues to cough, to go to the hospital for care. The doctor then tells the patient that he will be sent home in 30 minutes. He goes on to say that he will be fine for two years. This may sound tough for the patient, but is the best thing the doctor will do. He has to face and help the consequences of his choice, and by being proactive with the patient he can prevent a serious situation. He will be able to take away the pain he is causing his patient and by being proactive, he can avoid any other situations that could have an even harsher toll on the patient. It is also important to be proactive rather than reactive.\n\nInput: Freddy has the choice of whether or not to pay the toll for driving from the Bronx to Brooklyn.\nOutput: 10 (12.75)\n\nInput: The driver of a bus arrives at Union Square station", "answer": "D: headache"}

{"text": "happy\n\nThe first option is \"happy\", the second is \"smile\" the third is \"calm\" and the final way is \"relaxation\". This one is not too difficult to answer.\n\nThe \"happy\" option makes a lot of logical sense, as the more you listen to music, the happier you likely feel. If you're having a down day, listening to music will help. If you're stressed out, you may want to find something different to listen to.\n\n\"smile\" and \"calm\" are probably the worst options, though \"calm\" may be okay depending on your emotional state. The reason \"calming\" is a bad option is because you're more likely to choose the option that makes you feel more calm or relaxed, even if the other options are less stressful or more enjoyable. If you're depressed, the idea of listening to relaxing music may help soothe your mood. But the opposite is true, if you're stressed out then you would more than likely choose listening to something that will make you feel calm, as that will ease you out of your emotions as well as the stress.\n\nFor \"relaxation\", there is a lot of reasoning behind it that could be useful. If listening to relaxing music relaxes you, then it should certainly help you unwind if you get tired of work or are having a tough time of it outside of work. But, again, you should consider that some of the music you might choose to listen to might have a negative connotation, as it may give you the wrong idea and end up making you feel worse than you otherwise would have. If this is your only concern at this point, then you should probably decide later whether or not you want to relax or not.\n\n\"entertainment\" is also pretty strange and difficult to answer, as it depends on the person listening to it. A common example is when someone else is listening to it, but if they aren't having fun, they won't want to continue listening to it either. This also means a lot of cases could go either way, so, if you decide to listen to music when you're bored, you could be making things more fun for yourself or make things more boring for yourself, depending on how your enjoyment of the music effects you.\n\nYou could also argue that the \"relaxation\" option, like \"entertainment\", is situational. If you're really having a hard time of it, whether it", "answer": "C: calm"}

If the population is new, the mean is not updated until the second day is finished. If the population is new every day is updated.\nOption: If the population is new each day, then the x and y are just the sum of the population to the second or third day.\n\nInput: There is only one way to add 10 to 100. If the first 10 is even, the sum will add itself (since the 10th is even). The same is true with odd numbers. A sum of 10 to the 2nd day will add itself to the 3rd day unless it has the same first. If the sum has odd numbers, the 4th day must have the same starting number as the 3rd or else the 7th must have the same first.\nOption: The first 10 will add itself to the 2nd and the second 10 will add itself to third.\n\nResponse:\n1) When there is only 1 number remaining. You can do this by doubling the first number and doubling the remaining number. This gives you 100 with 1. Therefore, the sum is 9.\n2) This works well sometimes but not always, unless the remainder of the number is even. This means that the sum cannot be zero. You need to multiply the first number by the remaining 2, then by the other 2. This gives you 100 plus 1/3. If the remainder is odd, the sum can not be zero because it would fall to the right and make the remainder even.\n3) If both numbers are odd then you cannot add. If they are even, then the sum cannot be 0, so subtracting all numbers together does not give you the correct answer.\n1)\n2)\n3)\n\nInput: There was a small car accident with one fatality.

He decided to call his mechanic friend who works in the local mall. After spending 5 minutes with the computer that the mall has, the man realized that a local garage he has been looking at has been recommended before. He made the 3 mile drive to the garage and picked up his new favorite place to be, at the local big mall. The new place was way better; cleaner, more organized, more customer service, all free. The man got to the garage right when the garage opened and he was told to wait 15 minutes for service to begin. 5 minutes later he was told that his new, clean, organized, friendly garage was not the right place he wanted to be. He was a bit annoyed, but decided that he would try the other garage and that one was good. The original garage was pretty good. He could actually remember, very clearly, to ask the maintenance guy about something, as opposed to relying on what the maintenance guy was pointing out on the computer to get him started on fixing a problem. In short, he liked the original garage better. So, the man returned the favor. He recommended the new garage that he really liked that was the same size. The guy he used recommended that he look at \u201cbig box\u201d type garages near his home so that he would have many possibilities to choose from. The other garage he looked at was way way way more expensive. The other garage had fewer people working. He decided that the \u201cbig box\u2019 garage was the one he would try. Before the man even finished getting into the car his new favorite garage had a full service station and that garage was much cleaner, cleaner, cleaner, with more people working. He was so happy. At the end of his journey through the new garage he had purchased 3 new vehicles with his new preferred mechanic and had saved $150 on his cars alone. That morning he was greeted at the door by the owner of the garage and was offered a job. He decided to stay and take all three jobs. He had another $30 savings every day after 6 months at his first job. The other two shops he worked at in the same city also hired all 3 men. The third job was at the same company. He was making good money and a good life. He felt really good about helping the \u201cbig box-type\ufffd", "answer": "B: wave goodbye"}

{"text": "C\n\nThe last day of school is here! So, we all know that the end is near. To celebrate, we are going to play a game called M-O-R-I-O-N (pronounced MOR-eye-ON). This game consists of a team competing to get the most points and the best ending, but first you should know what all the elements make up a M-O-R I-N-D.\n\nFirst, let us start by defining our element. The first thing we will be looking for is a group of 4 numbers. This number will be used to evaluate the element's cost. So, there are a total of two groups of numbers. Let us say element number 1 (8) can be used for the element component of cost. After the numbers are calculated, the first one is left (1). Next, element number two (6) is considered a \"cost\" element because it costs more than both elements we previously looked at. The cost of element number one is now reduced by one so 4 (5) is now in the \"cost\" group. Next, let us add all the elements together. Now, all the elements are added up and the group ends up with 4 (6) and 8 (2). The cost of element number 8 is also reduced by one so there are now 4 (4) and 8 (2) in the group. So now there are 4 8's in the group. The group ends up with 8 8\u2032s.\nThus, element number two (5) is no longer a \"cost\" element. The cost remains the same. Now let's evaluate its cost. Now that the number 2 (5) is in the group, let's use the cost element (5) for the cost element's \"Cost\" component. Let's now calculate the cost of element number 2 (5). The group costs 4 (1) which is now less than 3 (1). Thus, the group now ends up with 3 (3) and 7 (2). Therefore, element element 2 (5) is no more the \"Cost\" element as it cost less than the \"Cost\" element (5). At this point, all four elements have been combined. You should now have 4 8's in the \"cost\" element groups. The first group can be eliminated by eliminating the cost element (6). All 4 8's should now be counted as 2 8's.

A customer bought 5 boxes of cereal for $1. The cost per box is $2.50. What was the selling price per case?\nOutput: 300\n\nInput:The cost per box of cereal depends on how much extra is added to the selling price. If the selling price per case is set at 100, then there will be 50 cases ready at a time. If the selling price of cereal is set at 60, the price per case will be 100. The difference between the selling price (100) and the cost per case (60) is the selling price per box. The difference between the cost per case (100) and the selling price (60) is the cost per case per case. The difference between the total cost of each case and the selling price is the selling price per case multiplied by the number of cases each box is available. Therefore, the sales price per case is equal to the selling price per box multiplied by the number of boxes in each case. The same applies for the value of the boxes compared to the value of any cereal purchased during a time. If the value of a box is $5, then the value of cereal purchased during that time is $35, and the selling price per case for that cereal is $2. It all adds up to $35.\nInput: $1.50 per box\nOutput: $35 = $2.00 per box\n\nInput: A person lives on a farm with 8 cows, a hog", "answer": "A: tennessee"}

Choices: A: fruit B: eggs C: honey D: fresh fruit\nOutput: 39\n\nFeeding a Parrot\n\nIn our free time, we like to feed our parrots. Often, they do this themselves. This is because parrots are smart, very social animals and will benefit from it. Parrots do better when they have something tasty to eat. A parrot that can only eat toast will suffer from obesity.\n\nFeeding Tips\n\nThe food we give the parrot should be simple and easy for us to prepare. This way, the bird can become familiar with it. We should not prepare the food very often. We should not make it too fresh or too salty. Our aim is to make the food simple so the birds will be able to figure out how to get it.\n\nThe parrot should have plenty of things that he can get his mouth around. He should have something to grab on to and something to chew onto, otherwise he will quickly get bored. We will focus on things that are easy for him (or other parrots) to get a hold of. The key is to avoid getting too messy. When you need to get a parrot, you need to be prepared for a lot of cleaning up! Parrots like to eat food and they like having their hands on things so they cannot let anything get out of hand when eating. We cannot force a bird into doing anything but what it likes eating. He will do what he wants to do. We have seen and heard of parrots eating pieces of wood, string, wires, and even the insides of their own toys. We would like to avoid any sharp objects when giving a parrot something to chew, chew on or even bite. We do encourage him to have fun with food in some way (a bird that eats nothing is bored).\n\nTo feed the bird we should put something around the piece of food that we feed him. We should make it visible to him so he is aware of what he has to do. For example, he should be able to see the fruits of his labor, the food we prepared and what he was able to eat. We should make the fruit and vegetables visible so the bird knows there is food out there to eat. We want to keep the bird occupied and busy until it learns something new.\n\nWhen giving the parrot food, we will need", "answer": "A: redemption"}

I never get tired of reading about such beautiful things, like these books or other items that are donated and given to children or other charitable organizations. The thing is, you don't have to be wealthy to donate and give in a very meaningful way. I read that you can buy books from the library or buy a gift certificate for Toys for Tots. The nice thing about it is that no one has to feel guilty about not being able to donate because it's the holidays and so much of the money is spent on family.\n\nA big portion of our daily lives is spent caring for others, either through our own giving, helping others through charity, helping out businesses to boost the economy, working, schooling, and other things to help the world out, and on and on. But so many people (even around the world) do not have the luxury of being able to do all that. We just see one person being given a book, or an extra dollar here or there from donations, and what is it doing for them? If all the money was donated to the person receiving all the donated money, they could make a difference in the lifetime of that person. That is what this was all about in our story.

And then both sides of a coin cannot be the same because they are 2 different coins. Therefore, either 1 or 2 sides cannot be the opposite of the other and both sides are the same. There are 7 different sides on one side of a coin. Therefore the coin is split into 3 sides, since there are 7 total sides to the coin.

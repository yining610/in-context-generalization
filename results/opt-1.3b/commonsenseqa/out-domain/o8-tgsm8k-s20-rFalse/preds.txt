He has had severe coughing attacks so many times during his time in the hospital that he is starting to lose consciousness. The doctor sends him home. There, the doctor is worried that the coughing will happen again and that it may result in a serious infection. Because the doctor doesn't want the patient to continue coughing, he brings in a nurse to help him. The nurse tells the patient that she will hold his coat, wipe down his hands and arms, and cover his mouth. This helps the cough disappear, but the coughing will get worse. The nurse takes his coat off, wipes his hands, and covers his mouth, but the coughing does not go away and when the nurse tries to leave, she falls to the floor and cannot get up. The patient is brought back into the room on oxygen, but the coughing still won't stop. The nurse can't think of anything else to do and is willing to do anything to help the patient. The doctor is not going to wait around. He wants the patient to undergo a surgery that will remove some tissue in his lung that has broken off. After the surgery is complete, the doctor tells the patient that he won't be able to breathe without a tube in his throat for at least six weeks. It will be a hard process for the patient to go through. Because the doctor hopes this will stop the cough, he doesn't want the patient, who continues to cough, to go to the hospital for care. The doctor then tells the patient that he will be sent home in 30 minutes. He goes on to say that he will be fine for two years. This may sound tough for the patient, but is the best thing the doctor will do. He has to face and help the consequences of his choice, and by being proactive with the patient he can prevent a serious situation. He will be able to take away the pain he is causing his patient and by being proactive, he can avoid any other situations that could have an even harsher toll on the patient. It is also important to be proactive rather than reactive.<n><n>Input: Freddy has the choice of whether or not to pay the toll for driving from the Bronx to Brooklyn.<n>Output: 10 (12.75)<n><n>Input: The driver of a bus arrives at Union Square station

Choices:  A: happy B: smile C: calm D: entertainment E: relaxation<n>Output:		 happy<n><n>The first option is "happy", the second is "smile" the third is "calm" and the final way is "relaxation". This one is not too difficult to answer.<n><n>The "happy" option makes a lot of logical sense, as the more you listen to music, the happier you likely feel. If you're having a down day, listening to music will help. If you're stressed out, you may want to find something different to listen to.<n><n>"smile" and "calm" are probably the worst options, though "calm" may be okay depending on your emotional state. The reason "calming" is a bad option is because you're more likely to choose the option that makes you feel more calm or relaxed, even if the other options are less stressful or more enjoyable. If you're depressed, the idea of listening to relaxing music may help soothe your mood. But the opposite is true, if you're stressed out then you would more than likely choose listening to something that will make you feel calm, as that will ease you out of your emotions as well as the stress.<n><n>For "relaxation", there is a lot of reasoning behind it that could be useful. If listening to relaxing music relaxes you, then it should certainly help you unwind if you get tired of work or are having a tough time of it outside of work. But, again, you should consider that some of the music you might choose to listen to might have a negative connotation, as it may give you the wrong idea and end up making you feel worse than you otherwise would have. If this is your only concern at this point, then you should probably decide later whether or not you want to relax or not.<n><n>"entertainment" is also pretty strange and difficult to answer, as it depends on the person listening to it. A common example is when someone else is listening to it, but if they aren't having fun, they won't want to continue listening to it either. This also means a lot of cases could go either way, so, if you decide to listen to music when you're bored, you could be making things more fun for yourself or make things more boring for yourself, depending on how your enjoyment of the music effects you.<n><n>You could also argue that the "relaxation" option, like "entertainment", is situational. If you're really having a hard time of it, whether it

What is x and y? x = number of days a number has been around in the population and y = number of days that this number will be around (or the mean). If the population is new, the mean is not updated until the second day is finished. If the population is new every day is updated.<n>Option: If the population is new each day, then the x and y are just the sum of the population to the second or third day.<n><n>Input: There is only one way to add 10 to 100. If the first 10 is even, the sum will add itself (since the 10th is even). The same is true with odd numbers. A sum of 10 to the 2nd day will add itself to the 3rd day unless it has the same first. If the sum has odd numbers, the 4th day must have the same starting number as the 3rd or else the 7th must have the same first.<n>Option: The first 10 will add itself to the 2nd and the second 10 will add itself to third.<n><n>Response:<n>1) When there is only 1 number remaining. You can do this by doubling the first number and doubling the remaining number. This gives you 100 with 1. Therefore, the sum is 9.<n>2) This works well sometimes but not always, unless the remainder of the number is even. This means that the sum cannot be zero. You need to multiply the first number by the remaining 2, then by the other 2. This gives you 100 plus 1/3. If the remainder is odd, the sum can not be zero because it would fall to the right and make the remainder even.<n>3) If both numbers are odd then you cannot add. If they are even, then the sum cannot be 0, so subtracting all numbers together does not give you the correct answer.<n>1)<n>2)<n>3)<n><n>Input: There was a small car accident with one fatality.

After spending 5 minutes with the computer that the mall has, the man realized that a local garage he has been looking at has been recommended before. He made the 3 mile drive to the garage and picked up his new favorite place to be, at the local big mall. The new place was way better; cleaner, more organized, more customer service, all free. The man got to the garage right when the garage opened and he was told to wait 15 minutes for service to begin. 5 minutes later he was told that his new, clean, organized, friendly garage was not the right place he wanted to be. He was a bit annoyed, but decided that he would try the other garage and that one was good. The original garage was pretty good. He could actually remember, very clearly, to ask the maintenance guy about something, as opposed to relying on what the maintenance guy was pointing out on the computer to get him started on fixing a problem. In short, he liked the original garage better. So, the man returned the favor. He recommended the new garage that he really liked that was the same size. The guy he used recommended that he look at “big box” type garages near his home so that he would have many possibilities to choose from. The other garage he looked at was way way way more expensive. The other garage had fewer people working. He decided that the “big box’ garage was the one he would try. Before the man even finished getting into the car his new favorite garage had a full service station and that garage was much cleaner, cleaner, cleaner, with more people working. He was so happy. At the end of his journey through the new garage he had purchased 3 new vehicles with his new preferred mechanic and had saved $150 on his cars alone. That morning he was greeted at the door by the owner of the garage and was offered a job. He decided to stay and take all three jobs. He had another $30 savings every day after 6 months at his first job. The other two shops he worked at in the same city also hired all 3 men. The third job was at the same company. He was making good money and a good life. He felt really good about helping the “big box-type�

They arrived at church to find the priest in the church with them, so they were ushered upstairs and told to wait outside while they got their picture taken in the sanctuary.

To celebrate, we are going to play a game called M-O-R-I-O-N (pronounced MOR-eye-ON). This game consists of a team competing to get the most points and the best ending, but first you should know what all the elements make up a M-O-R I-N-D.<n><n>First, let us start by defining our element. The first thing we will be looking for is a group of 4 numbers. This number will be used to evaluate the element's cost. So, there are a total of two groups of numbers. Let us say element number 1 (8) can be used for the element component of cost. After the numbers are calculated, the first one is left (1). Next, element number two (6) is considered a "cost" element because it costs more than both elements we previously looked at. The cost of element number one is now reduced by one so 4 (5) is now in the "cost" group. Next, let us add all the elements together. Now, all the elements are added up and the group ends up with 4 (6) and 8 (2). The cost of element number 8 is also reduced by one so there are now 4 (4) and 8 (2) in the group. So now there are 4 8's in the group. The group ends up with 8 8′s.<n>Thus, element number two (5) is no longer a "cost" element. The cost remains the same. Now let's evaluate its cost. Now that the number 2 (5) is in the group, let's use the cost element (5) for the cost element's "Cost" component. Let's now calculate the cost of element number 2 (5). The group costs 4 (1) which is now less than 3 (1). Thus, the group now ends up with 3 (3) and 7 (2). Therefore, element element 2 (5) is no more the "Cost" element as it cost less than the "Cost" element (5). At this point, all four elements have been combined. You should now have 4 8's in the "cost" element groups. The first group can be eliminated by eliminating the cost element (6). All 4 8's should now be counted as 2 8's. (I will show you how to do all that

Why, if I got caught with what it looked like I would have got away with? Did it look like I had that much tobacco products under my arm if I had? Maybe.

A customer bought 5 boxes of cereal for $1. The cost per box is $2.50. What was the selling price per case?<n>Output: 300<n><n>Input:The cost per box of cereal depends on how much extra is added to the selling price. If the selling price per case is set at 100, then there will be 50 cases ready at a time. If the selling price of cereal is set at 60, the price per case will be 100. The difference between the selling price (100) and the cost per case (60) is the selling price per box. The difference between the cost per case (100) and the selling price (60) is the cost per case per case. The difference between the total cost of each case and the selling price is the selling price per case multiplied by the number of cases each box is available. Therefore, the sales price per case is equal to the selling price per box multiplied by the number of boxes in each case. The same applies for the value of the boxes compared to the value of any cereal purchased during a time. If the value of a box is $5, then the value of cereal purchased during that time is $35, and the selling price per case for that cereal is $2. It all adds up to $35.<n>Input: $1.50 per box<n>Output: $35 = $2.00 per box<n><n>Input: A person lives on a farm with 8 cows, a hog

Choices: A: fruit B: eggs C: honey D: fresh fruit<n>Output: 39<n><n>Feeding a Parrot<n><n>In our free time, we like to feed our parrots. Often, they do this themselves. This is because parrots are smart, very social animals and will benefit from it. Parrots do better when they have something tasty to eat. A parrot that can only eat toast will suffer from obesity.<n><n>Feeding Tips<n><n>The food we give the parrot should be simple and easy for us to prepare. This way, the bird can become familiar with it. We should not prepare the food very often. We should not make it too fresh or too salty. Our aim is to make the food simple so the birds will be able to figure out how to get it.<n><n>The parrot should have plenty of things that he can get his mouth around. He should have something to grab on to and something to chew onto, otherwise he will quickly get bored. We will focus on things that are easy for him (or other parrots) to get a hold of. The key is to avoid getting too messy. When you need to get a parrot, you need to be prepared for a lot of cleaning up! Parrots like to eat food and they like having their hands on things so they cannot let anything get out of hand when eating. We cannot force a bird into doing anything but what it likes eating. He will do what he wants to do. We have seen and heard of parrots eating pieces of wood, string, wires, and even the insides of their own toys. We would like to avoid any sharp objects when giving a parrot something to chew, chew on or even bite. We do encourage him to have fun with food in some way (a bird that eats nothing is bored).<n><n>To feed the bird we should put something around the piece of food that we feed him. We should make it visible to him so he is aware of what he has to do. For example, he should be able to see the fruits of his labor, the food we prepared and what he was able to eat. We should make the fruit and vegetables visible so the bird knows there is food out there to eat. We want to keep the bird occupied and busy until it learns something new.<n><n>When giving the parrot food, we will need

They were seated in the third row. Cameron left his backpack at home and they had to go grab their bags from the airport in the first hour of the concert. They then met up with Gary and Lisa at a store to get their things and then headed to the concert. Cameron did not get his backpack until the second song. The reason Cameron did not get his bag until the second song was because the third song was later than the first song and he was sitting in the last row. Cameron, who is in the last row, has his backpack at home so he had only to go back to the store once to get his backpack and he was also sitting next to Mr. G and the professor. This explains Cameron's lack of being next to his backpack. Cameron knew where his bag was and that he needed to get it at the start of the concert. If Cameron did not have a backpack at home, who would have been the first one to find it and go back to the store to save him and take his backpack to the concert? A: the professor B: Craig C: Lawrence D: Larry E: Gary

Every year, Ford will sell 935,000 cars. To calculate the miles that one would need to drive in a Ford to reach the same mileage as another (non-Ford) car, add together the miles of driving that is done in a Ford and divide by 100, or 1,000.

In this post, we will learn about a few animals that have names and how the names might be explained in a couple of different ways.<n><n>First, I am going to give a list of some animals that have names, some animals that have owners, some animals that have never had names nor owners, and some animals that have both both owners or not had names.<n><n>* All animals have a species. Many people may have an idea about the species of their pets, or may just think that all dogs are retrievers or all cats are kittens.<n><n>* Some animals have names that have both a meaning and a name. Some animals that are named after a species, can take on multiple meanings, depending on the animal’s nature.<n><n>* Some known species are dog breeds and their relatives. For example, this could be “Blue” for Boxers, “Rottweiler” for Rottweilers, or “Bruski” for “Bruski Dog”.<n><n>In this post’s discussion, I covered why some animals have only a single name and some have multiple names, but if you

Which students came up with a high number and which students came up with a low number?<n>Output: 13<n><n>Input:There are 50 children in a school. Some children are in special classes such as children with hearing and vision impairments, English-language learners, children learning to play basketball, and so on. The school has 2 classrooms:<n>Classroom A: This classroom is for general education students. These students will receive general education instruction in reading, writing, geography, history, math, and science.<n>Classroom B: This classroom is for special education students. These students may require instruction in reading, writing and math, as well as instruction in emotional support or behavioral therapy. These students may require instructional assistance in reading, writing, and math. These students may also require additional counseling.<n><n>There are 3 teachers in the school. Each one also has 1 classroom. The teacher in the classroom A needs to spend time teaching all students to identify and evaluate their achievements. This is time consuming. The same time is also allocated to teaching each student how to recognize and recognize other students' achievements as well as teaching the students to avoid making others feel inferior. Each one must provide some guidance to the students, but this guidance must be specific and well-organized so that each student receives help with his or her specific level of difficulty and development.<n><n>The teachers in the classrooms A and B together, as a team, spend about 25 hours teaching all students in these classes. The total instructional time for all students in these classes totals about 15 hours.<n><n>Now, let's imagine that the student in the classroom B chooses to transfer into class A. She transfers on Monday and teaches the students how to make a statement in class in her class. At this point, only 1 or 2 teachers (the teachers in the classrooms A or B) may need to stay an extra hour with the new student before lunch. On Tuesday, another teacher may stay an extra hour before the first class starts. The teacher in the second classroom may stay an extra hour and half after the third class starts. At this point, the new student will have spent an extra 2 hours in her teachers' time. That is approximately one-half hour of extra time.<n>Because the teachers in both classrooms B and A spend around 25 hours in these classrooms per week, the cost of the extra 2 hours per student

A person with 100 pennies can buy a box if the box has all pennies in it. A person can pay 6 cents per penn token or 1 cents per token minus the amount of pennies that have been in each box. If the box has all pennents, the person can just buy 6 cents worth of things and can pay the people in the first box all at once. If the box has a penny in it, the person can keep buying 6 cents worth of things. If the box has half the pennies in it, the person must buy 1 cent worth of things first and then pay off the people in the second box. In the end, however, if the person has used up all their pennies in the first box, then the person can stop trying to fill the empty box with pennies and may even get the people from the first box to contribute. The last box with pennies has two pennies in it. In the end, the person only has to pay half the amount of pennies in the first and second boxes plus half of what the person has already paid to the person in the first box. If the person only has two pennies left in the second box, then the person may have to go to the second box for the others. Is the third box the same except that it only has two pennies remaining for both the person and the people from the second box?<n>Output: 2<n><n>Input:In the example, 4 people are playing a drinking game.

I never get tired of reading about such beautiful things, like these books or other items that are donated and given to children or other charitable organizations. The thing is, you don't have to be wealthy to donate and give in a very meaningful way. I read that you can buy books from the library or buy a gift certificate for Toys for Tots. The nice thing about it is that no one has to feel guilty about not being able to donate because it's the holidays and so much of the money is spent on family.<n><n>A big portion of our daily lives is spent caring for others, either through our own giving, helping others through charity, helping out businesses to boost the economy, working, schooling, and other things to help the world out, and on and on. But so many people (even around the world) do not have the luxury of being able to do all that. We just see one person being given a book, or an extra dollar here or there from donations, and what is it doing for them? If all the money was donated to the person receiving all the donated money, they could make a difference in the lifetime of that person. That is what this was all about in our story. These children are in need of the books for their new years, and we need to give, as well.<n><n>When I first took this class, we were given a list of people each one of us would like to donate to for the holidays. There were no limits. I chose myself, and for your families and friends that live far away, what do you give them this holiday season? Why?<n><n>I feel like every holiday season, even with just one card from a friend, I feel great and lucky to have made it through the year alive. When I received several cards this year, on Christmas Eve, I thought it would be a great gift to be able to provide at least one nice card to someone else in need, and that is what I have been doing, and I have had nothing but good things to say about each and everyone of them. As it turns out, there have

In the second example, he has two females dogs that are breeding puppies. Mr. Z makes a lot of money because he can sell the puppies to people who want puppies. However, because the male pups have more offspring than the female pups, Mr. Z's profit is smaller. The third example is about Mr. Z's books and it refers to his children, Mr. Z and his daughter. The last example refers to the name of the largest item that Mr. Z owns. This type of problem is different from the first two examples. In all 3 examples, Mr. Z's name is the title of the smallest piece of jewelry that he owns. In the second example Mr. Z's name goes from "Michael" to the name "Z," so there is no "Z Jr." in the third example. The fourth example is about the state of New Jersey and it refers to New Jersey itself. However, the title is "NJ," so Michael and Z Jr. can be the same person. Of course, in the fifth example, Mr. Z Jr. is the same person again only now his nickname is "Z," so he is still the same person. Mr. Z Sr. is still Michael and still works for the police department.<n><n>Input:The last three books were all read this week. The last book read was The Death of Ivan Ilych by T.S.

Which sides must you take into account, since both of the sides of the same coin are not the same? There are 7 different sides of a coin. Therefore, which 2 sides must you take into consideration? 2 sides cannot be the same because 2 sides are different. And then both sides of a coin cannot be the same because they are 2 different coins. Therefore, either 1 or 2 sides cannot be the opposite of the other and both sides are the same. There are 7 different sides on one side of a coin. Therefore the coin is split into 3 sides, since there are 7 total sides to the coin. Therefore, each side is the same number of sides from the same origin. Therefore both sides are the same number of sides. Therefore there could be 7 independent sides to every side, with each coin being its own unique coin. Therefore, not 2 coins are the same, nor are 2 coins that are the same.<n><n>Input: A.

Each person in the bus will have to count the money that is inside the box. If they get the same number inside each box, they will be done counting.

It's very rare that people can make a profit off of the purchase of a stock<n>b. There is often profit to be made on the sale of shares of stock<n>c.

Both a and b are true statements<n><n>Input: The following is a statement about stock index funds: "An individual usually is expected to make money on a stock purchase because he or she owns the stock, thus buying it at a higher price than what it was priced at when the stock was listed. If the price of the stock drops after you hold it, the money you made from the stock is lost; this is called a "short-run loss." A common type of error is buying an index fund at a lower price than when it was sold in the year it was created. Since the stock price has always risen during the calendar year, you must pay a larger amount to buy the stocks you need to invest for the year.<n><n>Output: 4<n><n>Input: A client buys a stock at $12.50 and then sells it for $15 and gives you $12 for the money you received, for a total profit of $9.00.

The payment is only $0.<n>(D) In the third year, the sales representative's salary increases from $12.50 in the first year to $14.25 in the second year.<n><n>Input: An employee buys a stock at $3 and sells it for $5. He is paid $2.50 for the loss. In the first year, he earns nothing for the loss.

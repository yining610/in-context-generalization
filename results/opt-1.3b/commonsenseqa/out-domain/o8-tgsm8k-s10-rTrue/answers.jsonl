He is dragging the wheelbarrow along the road, on one side at the rear, on the other side at the front.  On the third side of the path a large flock of sheep runs with the wheelbarrow, but the sheep is able to run free just forward of its animal friends.  When the sheep is in the front of the wheelbarrow, the farmer stops to ask for help.  When the animals are off track, the farmer again calls for assistance from his flock.  The sheep is finally able to get the load off the road because the animals are able to run out farther afield and into the fields in the farmer\u2019s way.\nOutput: In the description of the problem, the learner provides the general idea needed, which is exposure.  He also has a vocabulary of his ideas in forming a question as to how things actually happened.  He then develops his answer using the facts from the problem and then uses those facts to make a further decision about the solution.  Finally, he makes another choice, which is to choose to work with those sheep again, or to choose to choose to ignore the warning signs and move the animals off the road.\nThe learner gets the general idea through this problem, which is to become more aware of the way things actually work out.  This was not only learned through a series of practice questions but was practiced as a part of his natural growth.  When he got to the final decision, he still had not acquired the facts, but he had the vocabulary to choose.  He chose to ignore the warning signs, thus making a decision that was good in helping the sheep get away.  The final answer was to choose to choose to help these animals, or to choose to ignore the signs, thus making a poor decision.\nOutput: The learner now has a much stronger idea of what is actually happening in the world he lives in.

Each has equal responsibilities. Adam gets paid $10/month for his work, while his partner gets paid $9/month for his work. How many hours each person works at their jobs?\nOutput: Adam and partner work an hour per month each.\nSo Adam at $10/month works 20 hours a month while his partner works 21 hours per month.\nSo the final average is 20+21 = <<20+21=40>>40 hours a month each for Adam and partner\nSo the average for each person is 40/20 = <<40/20=60>>60 hours a month\nThat means they work 20/19 = <<20/19=70>>70 hours a month.\nSo the total for both people is $120/month.\nThat means they are working 9.5 hours a day.\nThat means a total of 21.5 hours a day are spent at work per month (excluding the time they spend at college, which is still 7 hours per day).\nThat means an hour at work equals $0.45, or $0.40/day\nSo an hour of work equates to $1.14\n\nInput: James makes the most money at the bowling alley.

The 5 widgets in each package are 4 inches high, 4 inches wide, and 5 inches long. She then packs those packages into a shipping box before shipping them to the loading bay. How many packages can she fit into each box?\nOutput: The 5 packages in each shipping box will have an area of 4*5*5 = <<4+5=10>>10 square inches\nEach box will have an area 20*20*20 of 20 = <<20*20^(10*5)+20 = 9000>>9,000 square. If each box has 2000 packages in it, then 2000/0.7 = 9000/4 * 20 = 1600 square feet.\nSo the total number of packages that she can fit is 4000 units.\nShe filled each box with 2400 units. The total amount of units she filled is 2000*2 = 9000*4 * 2400 = 2400,000 units.\nSo the total amount of units she shipped is 36000 units\nOutput: She shipped 36000 units. The total number of boxes she sent is 36000*2 = 36000/2 = 36000 which equals 36000. Because each box is 1200 square foot, the total amount of boxes sent is 2400 divided by 36000 = 36000*6 = 2400\nSo the total number she shipped is 2400 divided by 3600, or 36000^4 = 36240\nSo the total amount she shipped was 36\n\nInput:John goes to the store with a plastic bag and buys a gallon of milk for 50 cents, a quarter gallon for 40 cents, a sixth of a gallon for 30 cents, a quater of gallon for 30 cents, and four halves of gallon for 50 cents.

{"text": "The number of light angles an object can offer is measured by the ratio of surface area to total area. For instance, a wooden square with a radius of 1/6 and depth 1/4 can offer 6.1 different angles of light. This number can be used to measure the reflection of a surface. This means that if you could take a piece of wooden and shine a light directly on it, you could see how many different angles the surface could give off. If you could shine a light through an object, it would also be able to give you a reflection in the object.\nThe total area of an object divided by the total surface area of the object gives you the difference in brightness. If you wanted to have one object with a total area of 300 and another one with a total area of 200, you could see how much light the second one provides.\n\nInput:The number of eggs each duck egg can produce is 2.1.\nOutput: The number total number of eggs in a duck egg is 2.1 x 2.1 = 2.3 x 2.3 = 8.1\n\nInput:What is the difference between a 5-pound bag of flour and a 5-pound bag, of the same size, of rice?\nOutput: A 5-pound bag of rice has 4.4 grams of flour, whereas a 5-pound bag has 4 grams of flour plus 4 grams of rice.\n\nInput:There are 10 people in a house.

It would also cost at least $6,000,0000,000\nWhat is the actual cost of the 1000,000 mile journey?\nOutput:A trip of a thousand miles takes 7 days to complete at a daily cost of $30,000 a day.\nWhat is the actual per day cost of the journey?\nOutput:The average cost of crossing 1,000 miles of the border from Mexico to the United States is $15.80\nSo the cost to cross 1,000 miles of border would be $45.50 in per mile.\nThe total cost to cross 1,001 miles would be $78,50 in per mile. Let`s go back to the original problem.\nInput:3,000 miles is the distance that takes 24 hours to complete. How long would it take to cross 3,000 miles?\nOutput:A three-hour journey is about 3 hours (about 17 minutes).\n1. So the average travel time on a three hour trip is 33 minutes\n2. For three hours travel 3,000 miles you would have to spend 4 hours, 18 minutes\n3. Thus if you traveled 1,000 miles in 3 hours, it takes 3,000 miles for the same type of journey\nOutput:6 hours\n\nInput:Suppose a truck containing 10000 bricks has to go back to the factory.

He and his friends are getting ready to play a game in which each team has to score 100 goals in their group playing times. In case the score is not within the time limit John's team will not play. So John's team takes all other teams into a penalty shootout and if they score in this shootout another team wins. In case the team that scores in the shootout wins, so do the other teams. In case John scores, both sides score a goal to send the shootout to a shoot out, if John scores two more goals he scores 3 goals and wins.

If the batter strikes the ball out, the losing team gets their chance to strike also. After the last batter has struck out, the score is 1.\nEach player hits 8 bats, then returns to the batting cage and hits again. The next player that hits then gets 8 bats. The team wins the game if the last player who hit strikes out.\nEvery player hits 8 bats, so that is 72 bats.\nEach batter has 10 swings, so that is 48 bats.\nThe team with the highest total is always the winning team.\nEach person hits 8 bats, so he or she gets 48 bats.\n\nInput: A man is standing in the middle of a field.

How many pieces of bread have Donald eaten since the beginning of the day?\nOutput: The bread he just ate is now 2*5 = <<12*5 = 100>>100 pieces of bread\nSince Donald ate 5 bread pieces, every 2 hours he ate 12 bread pieces, which meant 1 bread piece every 10 minutes, or 1 piece every 10 minutes 2 times a day, or 2 bread pieces every hour. So the total of bread he has eaten so far is 100 = 2*5*20/2*5 = 240\nSo the final answer this day is 240 bread\n\nInput: Donald eats 8 pieces of bread per day.

He bought it new, so it has been insured, at a low cost. He also got a very good deal at the auto repair shop where he had taken his car for service.  However, his car got a flat. How much insurance does his car have, compared to his bill for repairs?\nOutput: His total bill for the repair was 1200 dollars. If his car had insurance on it, it would have cost him 1100 dollars to repair it.\nThe total cost of his car was 1300 dollars. So, the total price of the car's repairs was $1100*1200 = <<$1100+1200=1600>>1600 dollars\nSo, the total cost of his car's repairs (including the insurance) is 1600/1200 = <<1600/1200=1800>>1800 dollars.\nNow, as you can see, you can see that the total cost of his repairs (including the insurance, or the $1200 per day that it would cost to repair it) is $4000. If the car had insurance on it (even though it would have saved him $200 per day in repairs) it would have cost him $4000 in repairs.\nOutput: $3000 total cost.

When he gets a mortgage, home financing costs 3.3% of the purchase price, or $8,200. If he got a conventional mortgage, that would mean that the home value would be $150,000.\nOn the other hand, if he got a refinance, the loan would be 3.0%, less the $8,200 he paid for the house.

The number of eggs each pair produces is:\nA: 2 eggs = 0.5 hens\nB: 1 egg = 1 hens\nC: 1 egg = 1 chicken\nD: 0.5 hens = 7.5 eggs\nE: 3 hens = 2 eggs\nF: 4 hens = 4.5 eggs\nSo each egg produced by A equals 1 + 7.5 + 7.5 = 13.5 eggs.\nSince A has 4 hens and 1 egg will yield 13.5 eggs. A has 2 eggs which may double in size. This egg will produce 23.5 eggs. Since hens produce 3 eggs each time they are laid. This egg will double in size to yield 25.5 eggs. Since chickens only lay once per day. This egg will not increase in size. This egg can be eaten by B.\nSo when B eats 10 eggs, it will yield 13.5 egg. B gets 2 eggs from D and 3 eggs from F. Each egg produced by D is a double yolk. E gets 5 eggs. This egg can be consumed by John. A has 4 eggs. Each egg produced by A yields 1 egg. B gets 3 eggs from E. E. gets an egg from her brothers, but none of them will eat the egg he got. B does not want to eat the egg B got.\nBecause no one ate the eggs A produced, B was able to add 1 to the total. B has 11.5 eggs. Every egg produced by A yields 2 eggs. B has 17 eggs.", "answer": "D: wall"}

So if you speed up the plane by taking a different route, every plane should get to the next destination in a similar amount of time. The second rule is that if you fly for a certain amount of time, then speed up the plane for the rest of the trip. So if you fly 100 miles a day, increase the speed to 100 miles per hour, wait for 10 minutes, and then increase the speed again, that will give you a speed of 102 miles per hour.\nOutput: Since the first and second rules are correct, the second statement is also true, so the total speed is 102*100 = 106*100 = 107*100 = 107 miles per hour\nBy increasing the speed to 106 miles per hour, Ralph\u2019s speed is 107 miles per hour instead of 106 miles per hour\nBy flying faster, Ralph is able to get to the same destination as before\nSo the final answer will be a maximum of 107*100*106*100 = 107 miles a day\nSo after increasing the speed to 109 miles per hour, it will take an additional 30 minutes to get to the same speed as before\n\nInput:How fast can you drive from a point to a location using only one hand?\nOutput: What is the most important way to get from point A to point B", "answer": "E: erections"}

How many people did the city employ?\nOutput: 50,000,000\n50,000,000 x 5 = 1,000,000\nNow that the tower is transmitting, it will take it about 15 seconds to transmit a message. So for every 10 seconds it takes to transmit a single message, 150 people will have to wait longer than the 10 seconds to wait for it to be transmitted again.\nSo the city has to employ about 750 people to keep the tower going all the time.\nThat means 1,750/1000 = <<1/1000=0.01>>0.01 second between transmissions for every 1000 seconds of the 15 seconds\nIf we wanted to see 100 stations and 100 people broadcasting the same time every day, we would need to hire 250 people to keep the signal running all day.\nThat means 25,000/250 = <<25,000/250=0.03>>0.03 seconds between transmissions for every 10 seconds.\nIf we were to broadcast this to everyone at the same time every day for the next 100 days, we would need to employ 300 people to keep the station going every day.

Give your son $100 to pay off the loan, and keep the $1,000 that you gave him back. What should you do?\nOutput: Give him a loan worth $1,000 to pay off his loan.\nSo it costs George the sum of $100 to pay off this month's loan plus $1,000. If he only had $1,000 in his checking account, he would have $100 in his checking account. So he needs the $1000 from his friends. If he has $1,000 in a checkbook, then he can give $100 to his brother, Paul, if he needs the money now. However, if he only had $1 in his checking account, then he should give the money back to his son, who should have gotten the money for him.\nIf George only had $1 in the checking account and didn't owe the $1 to anyone, he should return it to his son, and keep the $100 that he gave him.\nSo George receives $100 from his wife instead of $100 from his friends. His wife can withdraw $100 from his account without worrying about it. Since the money he's given his son is for an actual purpose, and not an investment like in the case of his checkbook, his wife doesn't need to worry about it losing money.\nTherefore George receives a check plus a loan plus a transfer from his wife. That's one complete transaction. That's what one person would receive today if George had $1,000.\nIf George had $1,020 in his checking account, and only $100 from his wife, then he could not pay off his loan today.

Why do people consider the sun to be this high?  What other circumstances do people use this measurement of distance as a reason to go out and play a game of baseball, basketball, football, or any other sports?  Which other measurements used by people help calculate the sun's position in the sky?  The sun's position in relation to the Earth does not change, so the sun's position cannot move.  In order for it to be higher at other times the moon must move, and the moon does move.  Why can't the sun and the moon be placed so that the sun appears the same height at all times without having a change of position during the day?  The sun will be visible at all times, because it is always in the same place relative to the earth.  It is always higher on the horizon on the morning than it is during the winter and summer, even if the location of both sets of suns move from one night to the next.  If the location of the sun changed so that the sun didn't appear high in the sky on winter mornings, people would lose out on enjoying the sun when it was lower.  The sun always follows the ecliptic, so the same sun would always be highest at sunrise and lowest at sunset.

If the dog can drink a 12 ounce glass of water in 60 seconds, how much water should it drink in 60 seconds?\nOutput: The damage increases by 1/60*1/2*1/40 = 60 micrograms per second\nSo the total amount of damage the dog will experience when it drinks 60 micrograms of water is 60*1/40*1/20 = 240 micrograms per second.\nThe damage decreases by 50% for each of the other two halves of a second, and it then decreases by 100% for all the other three seconds. So all in all, once the dog drinks the 60 micrograms of liquid, it will drink about 2400 micrograms per second for its entire 5 second period.\nOutput: 240/60 = 2400/1200 = 3200 micrograms per second", "answer": "A: selling out"}

{"text": "The average annual salary for an executive in America is $280,000 dollars. Assuming each executive can only spend $1,000 per year per vacation, then $280,000 + $280,000 = $1,800 and $880,000 = $2,100. So vacation expenses would be $2,100 per month, or $900 per year, without a savings account.

The average person's life span is 1,200 years, or about 11.4 years. So, the average person spends 11 years living at school and 1/100th of their life at home.\nThus, the total number of days needed to reach the end of a student's school tenure is 4,800 times 4,800. Thus the number of days required to get every student to the end of school is 4,400 times 4,400. Thus the total number of days required to reach the end of school is 10,000 times 10,000.

He paid $15, or $3.72 per kilogram of meat. In the market, it would cost $18, or $4.84 per kilogram of mushrooms. How much would his meat and mushroom purchases cost him? Output: For the meat Adam paid $19 for 1 kg and paid $9.70 per kilogram of mushrooms for 3.5 kg.\nSo his meat and mushroom purchases would have cost him $19.70 + $9.70 = $20.20\nAnd for the mushrooms he would have paid $10 for 1 kg and paid less than $3.50 per kilogram.\nSo his meat cost him $20 + $10 + $3.50 = $23.70 while his mushrooms cost him $10.50 + $3.50 + $1.50 = $14.40\nSo for him he paid $23.70 + $14.40 = $21.50 for the meat and $15.50 for the mushrooms,\nA total of $42.50 was wasted for meat and mushrooms!\nThus he would lose about $1.30 for each kilogram he paid for meat and $4.30 for each kilo of mushrooms, or $5.40 and $7.50\nSo he would still lose money on his purchases.\nThat means that food costs money! He could have saved $5.40 and purchased 1kg of meat for $12.00\nHe could have purchased 2 kg of meat for $18 and spent $8.60 on mushrooms\nThus spending $18 saved him $5.40 + $8.60 = $22.90.\nSo if food is a serious expense he should cut back!\nThis means that food costs money\nAnd so food is more important then money!\n\nInput: A customer is buying a product at the local supermarket for $5.99.

A man on an 18 speed bike drives past him and they race to the other side of town one after the other.

You could say that the bike was 10 seconds slower. If the bike has a speed of 17 mph and the guy has a speed of 18 mph, the bike is one second faster and the guy is one second slower.\nBut let's say their speeds have both increased, so the bikes are now both 2 seconds faster. On the next roll-average they are now 4 seconds faster, they are now 6 seconds faster. Now it's 7 seconds faster, they are 8 seconds faster, and they are now 10 seconds faster. Then the bikes are 10 seconds faster and 10 second faster, they are 12 seconds faster and 12 second faster.\nSo it seems that their speeds have both increased by 5 to 6 times each in 10 seconds. So we say they are now both 8 seconds faster.\nThe average speed during the 3 races is also 8 seconds faster, now it's 9 seconds faster now.

Output: > The water surface is at the height 20*20*5 = 8.3 meters.\n> The water surface is 8.3 meters high = 8.3 meters\n> The water surface rises about 5 meters\n> The water is 8.3 meters\nSo the bird can't fly upwards. It has to land on the water surface. Since it can't fly, it has to land on the surface that is at the height 7*7=9.3 meters. If it had to stay in the air it would just float upwards.\n>The surface rises about 5 meters < 8.3 = 6.9\nSo again\n\nInput: A person is selling some fish in a market.

If I made a million dollars in a specific year, it wouldn't be $1,000,000 in a year. I'd need $2,000,000 to make $1,000,00. It probably wouldn't be worth more than 1/3 of 1% of my annual salary. So it depends on what kind of job I did that year and what the starting salary is in that job.\nThe starting salary is 10% of my earning. So it's $10 for every 1 million dollars. So in a year with a million dollars starting salary, at least $3,000,000 is the right answer.\n\nInput : How much damage does a hurricane cause?

If she eats all of the grains of wheat within 3 days, how many pounds of grain will she eat?\nOutput:The animal will gain 10,000*10000 = 40000 pounds of wheat upon eating all the grains of wheat.\nShe won't gain very much on the third day but she gains more than twice that amount on the second day\nSo the total weight of the animal is 40000 * 10000 = 480000 pounds\nSo the animal weighs 240000 * 100 = 30000 pounds\nAnd the animal only weighs that much due to the extra weight of the grains of wheat. She weighs 240000 + 30000 = <<240000+30000=480000>>480000 pounds.\nSo the final answered is 480000\n\nInput: A farmer builds a house for his son for 500,000.

Every time that he went out on the water he would turn the helm to the left and the steering wheel to the right.  The people aboard the boat would then do the same. Then Bill would go to the store and buy 2 cases of beer. If the helm and steering wheel were to be turned to the left and right, the left and right wheels of the boat would spin up and down. When Bill turned the steering wheel left or right, the boat would roll around. He called this \"twisting the head\". The boat would be on its side and upside down while the steering wheels were turned to the left and to the right. The couple on the boat would always turn the helm and steering wheel to the left and to right at the same time so that the boat would spin and stay on a straight course and not roll round. When Bill turned the helm right or left the boat would always roll on a straight course and wouldn't spin around. When Bill turned the steer to the left or right the right and the left wheels of the boat would pitch up and down.\nWhen Bill turns it to the left or right, the steering wheels are turned a full 360 degrees. This means the boat will always roll on its side. When Bill sets the helm at right or left the boat rolls on its side. The steering wheels have not moved at all.\nWhen Bill turns right or left, the sails flap. When they flap Bill assumes a standing position\nThe problem with this way is that sometimes people on the boat are standing, then he has to turn them to the right or left to get them to move off the boat.

Which variable (M and N) is likely to return a non-zero value for printM when the program is interrupted?\nOutput: Let N = M * interrupt0 for M to print a non-zero value. Then let N = P * interrupt0 for P to print a non-Zero value when the program is interrupted. Finally, let P be the number of interrupts. If these three variables are equal, then M is most likely to produce non-zero values for printM.\nOutput: N = P * interrupt2 = P * interrupt3 = <<3*2>>3 of the number of prints\nIf N of the N interrupt0s were zero, printM would be 1/60 of the number of prints, which is 10%.

{"text": "Foolhardy or thoughtful or discreet.\nFoolhardy:  A foolish choice is an action so risky that it could lead to serious injury.  For example, if David cuts his knee open with an ax and doesn\u2019t stop, he could seriously injure himself or someone else.  He has to think this dangerous act through carefully before he gets down to it.  For this reason, careful or deliberate choices can be made with higher risk factors in mind.  For example, selecting the right tool for a job or avoiding an emergency situation should be thought through carefully because these acts could require more planning than is practical.  Choosing smartly is less risky than stupidly, but careful or deliberate choices involve a higher level of risk.\nCleverly:  A clever choice is an action so clever that one does not risk the whole point of the move.  For example, David can\u2019t take his friend\u2019s advice to build a computer and risk doing it wrong.  Therefore, this act is clever.    Decidedly:  A decided choice is an action that is deliberate and well calculated.  David knows that in the long run, the computer will pay off many times over.  Therefore, this choice is decidedly.\nCarelly:  A carelly choice is an action so carelly that one is unaware that risk exists until it is too late.  In this case, careful decisions are made based upon careful consideration.  Thus, careful or carefully calculated choices are not as risky as foolhardy actions.\nCalculated:  A calculated choice is an effective action that protects the whole point of the action.  For example, one could choose to stay home and finish the laptop project or go to the bar and buy a beer and risk getting fired.  Both choices could be effective, but one of the two might lead to unwanted consequences.  Therefore, safe or calculated choices can be made with lower risk factors in mind.\nDetermined:  A determined choice is an action that cannot be stopped even if one wanted to.  To avoid this action, one would need to be stupid; however, intelligent or clever or determined choices can be made to avoid the decision.  For example, using the right tool to do a job may work better than not using the right tool at all since the use of the wrong tool can sometimes get one into trouble.  Finally, one who is determined will make the right choice.\n\nInput: John worked", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}

He will make half of his sales this month.  He wants to know how many days it will take him to recoup the loss by the time he stops making losses.  So he writes down the sales data per day for the last 3 months.  Then he divides that by 3 months.  The sales data shows that if John started out with 100 sales on Feb 1st, it would take him 16 days to recoup those sales from Feb 1st to Feb 15th.  If he stopped making payments on March 23rd, the sales would increase to 160.\nOutput: The sales will increase to 160 after 4 months because John has already recouped the losses he made from February to March.  At month 6, John should have recouped his losses from February to March of $3,000, so the final amount he needs to make during the first 4 months is $5,000\n\nInput:  A company sells one hundred thousand widgets to a client every year, the client expects the widgets to be shipped on February 1st of the following year.

The movie's producer, Paul Weitz, decided to change the name to \"Tarzan\", but it was discovered that this had been changed during the development of the script.

Others worry that any disaster in the moon could kill both the astronauts and the moon. What would you tell these people?\nOutput:If there was an impact on earth, the astronauts dying from a quake on the moon could make their death less fatal, if not impossible.  However, this would mean that the dead astronauts had to all live aboard the same plane while the rest of the plane crashes on earth.  Thus, since there is no guarantee that the moon is stable, such a plan would be almost impossible to make work, and the crash there would still be fatal to anyone on board the plane. The reason some find it impossible to launch on the moon is not based on fear of accidents on the moon, nor is it based on the notion that a crash on the moon would mean the astronauts would die on the spacecraft. Rather, many people are afraid of a catastrophic crash on the moon, and have come up with other ideas to solve the problem, such as launching from a different destination, or using new technology to avoid such a crash.  Thus, it is the fear of a catastrophic crash on an unstable moon that is keeping NASA from launching from the moon.\n\nInput:How many of a group of three given the option of eating the same meals each day would eat different meals each day?\nOutput: None.\nThey would have the option of changing their meals", "answer": "D: school"}

The equivalent equivalent amount of alcohol in a glass bottle is 10 pints of beer.\nOutput: David has 20 grams of sugar in two pints.\nA glass bottle of beer containing an equivalent equivalent amount of alcohol to 10 pints of beer contains 50 grams of sugar, thus David has 20 grams of added sugar, and drank 40grams of sugar throughout two weeks.\nThis means that Dave's total sugar intake for the two weeks is 20 grams of sugar per week, or 25 grams during the two weeks.\nNow you can use this knowledge to calculate daily sugar intake.\nEach glass of beer contains 0% of the equivalent equivalent amount of alcohol of 10 pints of beer, so the total for David is now 25 grams of sugar, or 25 grams of added sugar from just those two weeks of drinking.\nInput: The first week of June, Anna and George drank 20 glasses of wine during the first half of the day, with each glass being 10 ml. They also drank 10 pints of beer at different times during the day. They also had one glass of non-alcoholic ice water (0.5 ml) on Saturday at lunchtime and one glass at tea time. During those first five days, they had an average of 4.5 pints per day. At the end of the month they had 2.1 pints per day. Where did Anna and George put their alcohol intake from the wine and beer? Output: Average total daily alcohol intake: 25 grams Alcohol from wine or beer consumed by both: 25 grams Total daily alcohol intake of the two during the first half of June: 25 grams\nNow you have a rough idea of alcohol consumption throughout the month. Calculate how much of the difference between those two amounts of alcohol came from wine or beer.\nNow repeat the following question.\nInput: The number or cans of soft drinks per week at the store is 2.5. How much of that amount of soft drinks is soda?\nOutput: The equivalent equivalent amount of soft drinks in cans per week: 4.5\nSo the total amount of soda in the store is then", "answer": "E: retail store"}
{"text": "Place olives in a container in the fridge where they don't get near any food.\nSo where does this result?\n\nInput: If you take 5 pounds of meat and another 5 pounds of meat, you have to combine the two because they are too different. For example, if you start out with five pounds of chicken, you only want to combine four pounds of red meat, one pound of poultry, and 0.5 pounds of sausage. You can only combine meat which gives you 90*1 = 105% of your original amount. So if you have 10 pounds of chicken and you add 5 pounds of red meat and 1 pound of poultry, you now have 40*1 = 65% of your original amount of chicken, and 40*1*1 = 25% of the red meat and 1 pound, 1 ounce of poultry.\nOutput: The amount of meat that you now combined is now 105*1*1 = 145*1*125 = 135%. The amount of red meat and poultry is now 25*1*25 = 35% of your original amount instead.\nTherefore, the combined result is 135 / 1 = 25. The original results are 45*1 / 1 = 30, and 60*1 / 1 = 55. These results are larger in value, but smaller in magnitude.\nSo combining 15 pounds of red meat into 7 pounds of poultry reduces your total meat supply by 45*1 = 15%\nIn this situation, where you had 100 pounds of chicken in one container, you now only have 60*1 * 1 = 25 in another container. This means that your chicken supply has dropped from 100*1 = 135% to 95*1 * 1 = 75%\nSo your original chicken supply was 225% of original amount but now the amount of chicken was 135%\nNow, you have 225% of 75% of 100*1*100\nThus, the combined product is 135 / 1 = 15\nThus, it is 135 / 15 = 30\n\nInput: William is a plumber that fixes a lot of plumbing problems in his neighborhood.

However, it is not allowed to hire a new police officer on the last day of each month. This is because of the way state law is structured.  When a new law is in effect, the state simply pays for the newly hired officer's salary for the month, rather than using state money to hire and fire the new officer. This practice does not affect the existing law because they hired the new employee with state money already. Under normal circumstances, the state would be obligated to hire and fire all the new officers under the same budget. However, the state is barred from firing any of the existing officers on \"last day of month.\"  The first state statute was passed in 1914, three months before World War I.  Because World War I was in effect when the first state statute was written, the first statute states that the first three months after the first state statute was passed is within the year. However, for fiscal year 2010, the state's budget only covers one third of normal salaries for new and existing officers. Therefore, under the new state law, it cannot hire a new officer on the last day to replace the 3,400 officers it will already have already hired for the first three months of the fiscal year. The state does however require each state legislator to be elected and each state superintendent to be reappointed as part of their compensation, each new year of this new law. Under normal fiscal year rules, the legislature would use the same annual budget to fill the vacancies.  The fact that three months elapsed before this new law became effective, does not affect the fact that the state no longer has to use the same budget for all state employees to hire a new officer to fill any vacancies.\nThe reason that the first state statute was created is because most people at the time did not understand that having a state that hired the same number of police as it already had (let alone increased the number if the number of officers did not change), would cause problems for the police. They feared that if they could go to jail or have to work extra hours without pay for the very last", "answer": "B: new mexico"}

What distance would it take to walk about 13.5 meters?\nOutput: If a person walked more than 13.5 meters, his walk would take ~10 seconds to complete. His walk would therefore take 11.75^2 + ~10^2 = 1620.5 meters. (Assuming he walked at 8.5 m/s for his total distance, plus 12 seconds for walking in a clockwise direction, and 2 seconds for walking diagonally at an angle of 30 deg. to the left hand axis of the circle that is his walking direction)\nSo on average he would need to walk 8.5 meters to complete a walk, so on average he would need approximately 29 seconds to walk between two points.\nUsing this calculation he would therefore not need a longer walking stick than his walking stick length.  Therefore he needs only one walkstick.  Hence, in order to do 13.5 meters in one minute, one needs two walking sticks.\nHowever, it could not be assumed that the walks along the left hand side of the circle (which he uses to calculate his walking speed) have the same length.  Hence he needs a second walking stick in order to obtain his walking speed (11.75^2 + 8.5^2 * 2 = 1620.5 * 8.5/2 = 2180.5 meters).  The length of the second walking stick must therefore be 10.75^2 + 10^2 * 2 = 2075\n(Where 2075 is 4 times his walking stick length)\nSo the length of his second walking stick would be: 20 * 3 = 3.75 * 1.5 = 21.5\n(Where 21.5 is the average length of a walking stick)\n\nInput:  A is 13.5 feet tall, 8.5 feet long, 2.5 feet wide and weighs about 18 pounds.

I reached out with my finger and tapped it so it would bounce off the front of the rack and onto the floor. Then I picked it up and placed it on the counter. It was too heavy for my 2-3 pound frame and went right to the back of the counter. So I picked up the box and got the second one. I put the second one in the first shelf and then looked at the chain box one again. The second one was in the front of the rack. I reached out again with my finger and tapped that, so the choker would bounce off the front rack and onto the floor and onto the wall next to the rack.

One of them brings a pillowcase from the children\u2019s room.  Before the fight can start, several grownups rush in, grab the pillowcase from the children, and force it over the children\u2019s heads. What happened? Why did the grownups do that?\nOutput: When the grownups held the pillowcase over the children\u2019 heads, they pushed the nose, mouth, chin, and chin-to-chest area of the child\u2019s shirt down. That way the child\u2019s jaw was pushed back and her tongue was pushed downward. That pushed the top of her head back and out of its hiding place. The kids became unconscious for several seconds. When the grownups put the pillowcase back on their heads, they pressed the upper parts of their cheeks against their own upper cheeks. This helped them relax and stopped the fight.\nThe grownups pulled all the stuffed animals back from the children and placed them around them. Then they placed other stuffed animals on the children, under the pillowcase. Since the grownups held the collar of the shirt in place, the collar is still there now. What happened to the collar? Why wasn\u2019t it held in place?\nOutput: The grownups pulled the collar back against their upper chests, which pushed it back further against the collar. When the collar was pushed back, the shirt collapsed in around its wearer\u2019s neck.\nThe clothes and the collar now held the children against each other\u2019s bodies. So the children\u2019s clothes and their shirts became the shirts of the grownups too. The shirts, however, were put on with their chin. That\u2019s why their chins and shirt collars became chins. The collar itself became their shirt collars. What caused the collars to become shirts?\nOutput: The collar of the shirt was the \u201ccollar\u201d of the grownups\u2019 clothing. The collar is where the body begins. It is where the body stops.\nThe collar did not become the shirt because it wasn\u2019t the shirt of the grownups. It became a new shirt that had new body parts.

The company used to have 30 workers. However, now they only have 4 people.  The number of people is 4 * 30 = 60. Can you guess how many hours of work it took them to get this number down to 4?\nOutput: 4 * 60 = 60 hours of work.\nSo the total amount of hours they did in just the first week is about 60 hours. Thus the total amount they got for the year was 60*40 * 60 = 160 hours.\nIf they would continue working for another 4 weeks, and if their total hours were 60*40 * 20, that means that they would have spent 1/4 of their working life working.  The total hours of work in a year would be 160/40 = >32% of their working life spent actually working.  The final answer is 32%", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

If a town only accounts for 13% of a town's population, the population of that town must be 13% smaller.\nInput:The population of a town makes up 5% of a town's total population. The population of a town is the whole town population divided by 31. The total population of a town is then 5 * 31 = 10,000. How tall are the townspeople of each town?\nOutput: The total number of people the town has in that town is 10*3 * 31 = 1383. A total of 10% of 1383 is 1763 people.\nSo the total population of each town is 5*1763 = <<5*1763=2500>>2500 people.\nThe total population of each town must therefore be 4 * 2500 * 31 = 1600 people.\nSo the final population of each town is 300 * ~1600 = 100\nThe total population of a town must therefore be ~300 * ~1600 = 600\nSo the final population is = = = = = 600\nThe population of a town is 20 * 600 = 100,000\nThe area required to fill up those 1000 people to fill the town is 80000 * 1000 = 60000 square meters.\nThat's about 160000 square feet.

But on the lower level, you're also standing right in the middle of the river, in the middle of the stream, so your rock hits that level.\nFrom that level, the water is almost vertical. If you throw your rock hard enough, your rock will break into pieces and will hit the surface of the water.\nFrom the top of a mountain, you can see the whole thing. From that point of view, it looks pretty big. So because the rock is heavy, there may be a lot of splashbacks.\nYou should now be looking behind you, towards the water. From this point of view, your rock didn't hit the water. Instead, the rock hit a small rock that happened to be in its way. This rock then broke off, and its parts fell into the river.\nBut from the right side of your view, your rock hit an other rock on the mountain that happened to be facing away from you. And the two rocks hit each other, so a portion of your rock hit the rocks behind the two rocks that had hit it off. This rock then broke as well, and its parts fell down into the river below.\nFrom this point of view, the rock that you threw was hitting rocks far below you. Now you want to throw it over an even taller bridge so it hit the water at less of an angle", "answer": "C: bridge"}

Playing sports without competition for men is also more likely if the person is an athlete and playing for money. Playing for money for women is less likely.

What percentage of the total farm produce is left to eat?\n Input: All the goats and the sheep have 50% of the milk\n\nExplanation: There are two ways to calculate the percentage of unused food in a particular country. First, add the amount of available food in a country to the amount of people who eat that food. For example, in the case of the United States, the US has 300 million people, while the US has a total of 310 billion dollars of available food!\n Second, add the total amount of food that people in the US consume each year to the amount of food people in India have been used on before. For example, in 1984, India consumed 20 billion dollars worth of food each year. It produced 5 billion dollars worth of food every year. India has a total of about 400 billion dollars of food. To add these two numbers together, we would need a total of 620 billion dollars of food, or 10 times the amount of food India consumes each year.\n\nExplanation\nInput:\nThe table below lists the countries whose populations are below the United Nations sustainable development goal of 8 billion by the year 2000.\n\nOutput: In the United States, 532,000 students died in 2009.

In the third quarter, Adam gets hurt. As he lies there in the ground, do you find that he is able to roll his arm over his shoulder? Output: Adam does not roll his arm over his shoulders. And he does not carry the football upfield to run another play. Instead he lays on the ground. Since he is laying on the ground, Adam does not carry the ball upfield.

How much $ will John spend for the 100 chickens?\nOutput: John pays $1,000 for 100 chickens.\n100 chickens * 1/5000 = $500\nThat\u2019s $250 for 100 chickens\nSo John spends $500\n\nInput: A person has to do several chores every day and each chore has to be done with a certain amount of time. How much time does the person have to do his/her chores?\nOutput: The person has 9*9 = 960 hours to complete his/her chores\nSince 9*960 = 960 hours, it takes 960 hours+9*960 = 960*960 = 960**9*960 = 960 hours per month\nSo the actual monthly time of doing your chores depends on the amount of time you spend on different chores. At a minimum, you have to do the chores every day for a month. At a maximum, you are stuck with all the chores that are in your list for that particular month. That means you will end up spending months finishing less chores than you originally planned.\nThat means if you have set a goal of finishing 100 chores, you will only finish 90 chores within a month. That would be a failure.\n\nInput: The US economy relies heavily on natural resources. The price of oil, gas, and metals skyrocketed over the past year.

How much oxygen does the tree in the greenhouse consume?\nOutput: If they produce 12% less oxygen than the ground, the tree is consuming 14% less oxygen than the trees growing in the ground.\nSince the tree is consuming 14*12*0.14 = <<14*12*0.2 >>14% more oxygen\nso the total energy produced by the tree is 14*12*0 = <<14*12 * 0.2 >>14% less\nTherefore, the tree is consuming a total less energy than the ground has provided, so this equation has an incorrect result.\nSo the final equation is: 14*12 = 14% less energy\nSo the final answer  is 14% less energy\n(Note: The value 12, which corresponds to 1/8 of an apple, is not used in this example since it is a unit of power)\n\nInput: A woman who has lost 40 lb. in 2 months wants to lose another 22 lb. in the next 2 months.  What will she do to lose another 22 lb.?  Input: Weight: 6.25KG + 26.25 kg = 67.25 KG + 60.25 kg = 170.5 KG+120.5 KG = 230.1 KG + 140.5 KG = 240.1 KG+160.5 KG = 260.1 KG\nOutput: Weight lost: 6.25Kg+26.25 kg = 67 + 26.25kg + 60 + 60 kg = 67.25KG+60 + 130 + 120 = 66KG\nSo the woman had to stop working out because she was having muscle cramps in her legs.  Her total daily physical activity is 100 minutes (50 mins walking and 50 mins weight training).  She therefore loses 16.5 hours of physical activity in 2 months, which averages out to an hour of less physical activity a day.\nSo the woman lost 16.5 Kg of muscle in 2 months\nThat is what happens if you exercise as hard as you can for a long time and not for any substantial length of time.\nSo the final question is\n16.5", "answer": "D: unhappy"}

This was all done by walking, running, bicycling, swimming, or jogging. What is your body mass?\nOutput: Body Mass Index = BMI = weight/height * 2.0\nBMI is a measure of body fat percentage. So the number of grams of fat you eat is how much fat you have\nSo in a day you eat 1.4 grams of fat = 0.8 grams of fat per kg of body weight, or how much fat you are eating in grams\nIn a week you eat 2.6 grams of fat + 2.6 grams of sugar = 3.3 grams of fat per kgof body weight, or how fat you are eating in calories\nIn a month you eat 3.5 grams of fat + 3.5 grams of sugar = 6 grams of fat per kg or how much fat you're eating in calories\nIn five months you eat 5.5 grams of fat per kg per month or how fat you're eating in grams\nSince that's the average, the average weight range for people from 3 kg to 18 kg for weight is 100-300 lbs. So the average BMI for 3 kg to 18 kg is 32\nSince your body mass is 32, the number of food grams that will change to fat is 3*32/32 equals 0.3 grams of fat\nSince you have already had 20 grams of fat, and you have already eaten 18 grams of sugar and 18 grams of protein, 3*18*18*18 =\n27 grams of fat\n27 grams of sugar\n28 grams of protein\n2.0 grams of fat in total\n\nInput: In 2035, there is approximately 1 in 10 people who will be in a nursing home.

Which amount of weight does the elephant need to sit before it is comfortable?\nOutput: To be comfortable, the elephant needs a weight of 200 pounds per square foot. This is an area of 4 sq ft / 200 lbs.\nTherefore it takes 3 x 200 = 3200 lbs. = 3200 lbs / 4 = 100 lbs\nTo be comfortable, the elephant also needs the weight of a pillow and a blanket. This is an area 3x100 = 3x100.\nTherefore it takes 100 lbs / 100 sq ft = 100 lbs / 200 sq ft = 300 lbs.\nTo make the elephant comfortable, it also needs the weight of an umbrella. This is an area 100 by 500 sq ft / 300 lbs.\nTherefore it makes 100/300 = 100/300 = 6.5 lbs.\n\nInput: John worked at the computer store for 19 years.

Today you have two employees with full carton boxes that must be unboxed to fill them with fresh fruit. They have been understaffed ever since the day they started. How many boxes must they unbox, in your estimation, to get the fruit that you want?\nOutput: To fill the two cartons full of fruit they will have to unpick two boxes.\nGiven that they are understaffed on average during a month, that is 2 * 2 * 3 = 4.5 boxes that they will have to unbox.\nIf the number of boxes that they will have unpacked at the end of the month is 4.5 boxes, then the total number of boxes unpacked in the entire year must be 4 * 4 = 20\nSo they have less than 16 hours to finish unpacking the 2 cartons (total of 8 boxes in the box and 2 cartons in the two cartons) and they will be understaffed by 16/40 = <16/40> of the time\nSo the final answer will be 18\n\nInput:You are paying $0.10 cents per pound for corn and $5.00 cents per bushel for soybeans in the country.

Which of the following would you put it on:\nA:The table B: the couch C:The chair D:The chair and bed\nOutput: A,B and C, although you could place other beds in the room depending on how many visitors you have or how you use the room.\nThe bed in front of the couch is a comfortable bed. It has a high back cushion and a soft pillow so that people can stay comfortable without spending all night in the chair. It is also a good place to put a small television to watch TV shows or play video games.  The couch in front of the desk is probably the worst mattress option because it has a thick mattock on it. This mattress is heavy, so you won\u2019t be able to move around much since it is so comfortable. If you look at it closely you can see that it has a hole made in it to allow air to get in and out of the bed in case of a fire. The mattress is also very uncomfortable on the back, so if you fall asleep you probably won\u2019t sleep very well. The mattress in the front of the cabinet is probably the worst option since it has a hole in it too so that air can get in and out of it in case of a fire, a hole in it so that air can come in through the hole as well, and a hard mattress. The mattress in front of the bed is the best option because there is no hole in it to allow air in and air out, and there is no hard mattress. The couch back is comfortable enough, and the couch is so light that you will not be able to move it quickly to get out of the way in case of a fire or a heavy object that needs to be moved.\nThe mattress where the door leads out of the room is the best mattress option since there is no hole in those mattocks either. However, since there is no mattress attached to them, it will also be hard, so it won\u2019t be a good place for visitors to sleep. The mattress next to the bed is probably the second best option since there is a mattress on it, and it is a very comfortable mattress. The mattress next to bed D is probably the most uncomfortable because one side is flat, where the other side has several layers of fabric underneath it so that it is", "answer": "C: backyard"}

If so, how fast?\nOutput: Yes, because high speed means the driver is not steering with the rear axles. So the car has to be in controll.\nFor the car to be in control, the driver must be in control of the front four wheels. But the first thing drivers do when they don\u2019t have control of their steering is accelerate and brake. Cars can\u2019t accelerate and brake if there is no steering.

How many bricks can you fill the dump truck with, given that only one pile has each of the 25 bricks in the mix?\nOutput: One pile: 25 * 50 = <<25*50=120>>120 bricks\nOne pile: 30 * 50 = <<30*50=200>>200 bricks\nOne pile: 50 * 50 = <<50*50=300>>300 bricks\nA stack of 25 bricks does not fill a dump truck in 10 minutes.\nSo the total time it takes to fill the truck is 20 minutes.\nSo the final response is 8\n\nInput: When you have a stack of 25 bricks, they fit perfectly into a 4-inch square box. Each brick is 4 inches deep, 4 inches wide, and 4 inches high. So take a stack of 25 bricks and divide them up into 6 stacks, each with 50 bricks in it. Each stack consists of 25 bricks, so there are 25 x 6 = 50 x 12 = 100 bricks in the stack. When you add 15 of the 50 bricks, you have 25 x 12 = 75 x 12 = 500 bricks in the stack. You put another 7 bricks on each side of one stack. All together you have 75 * 3 = 375 bricks in your stack. How many bricks does a stack of 75 x 12 = 375 x 3 = 1212 bricks?\nOutput: When you add 15 of 50 bricks, you have a stack of 75 * 3 = 375 * 3 = 1212 bricks\nAnd so that gives you a stack of 824 * 3 = 4212 brick.\nWhen you add 15 more 50 bricks to the stack, the stack of 25 x 3 = 75 x 3 = 300 x 3 = 1212 x 3 = 4212 x 3 = 4220 x 3 = 4224 x 3\n12,000 x 3 = 12,000 x 3,000 x 6\nThe total number of bricks in your stack is 25 x 3,750 = <<25*3,750=12>>12", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

However, she cannot write enough in her 1 hour to describe the book, so she breaks down the problems in an 8 hour day and divides that by the number of hours she worked. The result is that she covers only 20 percent of her day. The other 80 percent is split equally between writing and shopping. What percentage of her day is spent shopping?\nInput: Alice makes an 8-hour day: 6 hours for the shopping, 2 hours for writing, 1 hour for reading. She writes 2,000 words of her book each hour. The total amount of writing work is 100.\nOutput: If she started with the shopping, Alice made only $1.\nAssuming she works the rest of the day, that means she would have worked 25% of her 24 hour day.

It is covered with pipes that will release gases when cars accelerate into an enclosed space and emit CO2 when the cars crash into walls. How many pipes are there in the tailpipe?\nOutput: Total volume released is 10 cubic feet per minute.\nThe total volume of gas emitted from every car that accelerates into an enclosed space is 300 cubic feet per minute. That means 50% of the air in the car is being released as carbon dioxide.\nThe total volume released from every crash into a wall is 300 cubic feet per second. That means the air in the room is being released as carbon monoxide.\nThe combined effect is 300 cubic feet of both carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide inside the enclosed space.\nSo since only 200 of the car's 300 cubic feet of air gets released into the enclosed area, the air outside the enclosed space is less than 100 cubic feet of carbon dioxide.\n\nInput: What is the difference between a car's rear window and the passenger's front window?

Thus, it is a window.\nThus, B is the window. Therefore since A and E are on its top, it is a window too.\nTherefore, A and E are both windows.\nSo A and E together make up the passenger's front window. The combined effect is A's front window.\n\nInput: A man gets a haircut at a barber shop for a fee of only 40\u00a2.

He should be cleaning the deck with a hose and a sponge to wash the deck in a week's time  He should be doing that\nSo the captain said this means only one monkey is left at the zoo, the monkey at the south africa zone. The monkey at the zoo should help the conductor get rid of all the dead animals because that's what all monkeys do.\nSo the monkey worked at the zoo the whole day and the conductor got rid all the dead animals.\nSo the final result is 4*4*4=<<4*4*4=6>>6 animals.\nSo the captain said 3 monkeys are left at the zoo and the train.

Each shelf in the pantry can hold 10 cans. Each shelf can hold 6 cans stacked on top of each. Each shelf stores 10 cans in total.\nThe cellar holds 1 can each. The cellar is empty.\nSo you want to know the total weight of all can you can store in an average sized refrigerator. So give this number, take off the 4 cans for the shelf space, and multiply by 10. Divide that by the number of can storage levels, and plug into the formula:\nTotal Can Storage = {400/4} x Number of storage levels Batch Can Store 1 Can Store 2 Can Store 3...Batch Can Store 100\nOr if you want to know each can by type, you can use the formula I have presented here:\nEach type has the following dimensions:\nType Can Width: 16.5\" Height: 5.5\"\nEach type has the same interior space capacity, so let's do a bit of math here:\nType can Storage Capacity + 4xWidth x 5xHeight = 9 x 9x9x9 = 12 cubic feet\nAs for the capacity of each store level, well, this depends on how many shelves your refrigerator has.

And, because of the way it is determined for the 1-month intervals, the 1-month temperature is still a maximum that can happen only during July.\nThere are also some problems where a 2-day or 3-day temperature is not a maximum, which means the next maximum temperature is not a maximum that can happen during the year\nThe answer is that it is not possible to get a 2-day or a 3-day", "answer": "C: open boxes"}

How many men push the loaf of bread at a time? How many pull the dough?\noutput: About 100 men push the loaf at a time, so 300 kg = 300*10kg = 300 kg.\nSince the weight of the bread is 300 kg, the total weight of the bread is 2200 kg = 2200+300 = 2400 kg\nSo there are 2500 kg in the car.\nSo this whole time each man is pulling 400 kg of bread towards him, and each man is pushing 100 kg towards him, the total movement of each person is 4000 kg towards him (each pulling 400 kg of bread and pushing 100 kg of bread).

The answer will take into account the fact that the homebuilder is paying interest and the interest will cover the purchase price, thus making the down payment 10% less than the $100,000.\nOutput: If you close when the $100,000 home buy is at the end of 6 years, then the down payment will be $10,000 less than the new purchase price.\nIf you close before the 6 years is up, then the down payment would be $10,000 greater than the new purchase price\nSo it's easier to buy when you close early but if you hold off until the end of the 6 years, home building costs would increase causing the price to go up.\nYou have a home for 6 years before you can start selling which is 40 months of activity. You have a price in your home at the time of closing but if you wait until the end of the 60 months, then the new price would be $100,000 more. Then selling the home after the 120 months would cause the new price to be $200,000 less than the original price.\nAnd buying an older home while there are no prices around would cause the value to drop.\n\nThis question is similar to \"Number of Hours of Activity/Month\"\nInput: If the current time on your cell phone is 5 p.m., how long until you have to go to a client?\nOutput: For any client who shows up at 5 p.m. on a given day, take 10 minutes to work on whatever email you already have in the queue.\nSo you worked an hour", "answer": "D: dinner"}

The cost to transport a boat from ship to boat is $10-15 because the total of the boat's length and the distance it needs to be transported is greater than the length required by ship. So the cost of transportation by train or boat is less than the cost of transportation in the ship. The cost of transportation by train to ship by boat is $30-40. The cost to ship from a train to a train is more than the cost from ship to ship by boat for the same amount of cargo. The cost of transportation is less than the cost to send a ship to ship. If you decide to wait in line to go on a train or have extra change, you can travel a shorter distance and you will pay less for transportation by train, but you will also have to wait in any line. When you decide to use an airline and wait in the plane line, you can take up to 9 more persons and you can select how many rows you want on the floor and you can choose how many gates you want and what the gate number is for that particular airline.

You go to an on-demand movie service for 3 hours a day to see more movies.\nSo the total number of movies you've seen in the house is 5.5 * 100 =<<5.5*100=800>>800\nWhen you go to see a movie at the theater, you are there for the entire day. You go to a multiplex movie theater 10 times in one day.\nWhen you take a bathroom break before the movie, you are there 6 times before you watch the next movie. On an ordinary day, you go to a multiplex theater 1.5 times a week and see 1 new movie each week.\nSo the total time you have seen one movie at the theater is 10 * 2 * 1 = <<1.5 * 2 * 1=16>>16 hours\nThe total time you see one movie at the movies at the mall is 20 * 20 = <<20*20=1200>>1200 minutes\nSo the total hours you spent going to the theater, the mall, and to multiplex movies is 16.5 * 12 ** 800 = 1600\nThe total hours you spent watching movies in each town and at the mall is 8 * 60 = 880\nSo the total time it took to see a movie at 880 theaters is 20 hours > 20 hours > 880\nAnd each movie theater had 800*5*1 = >800*5*1 = 880\n\nFeedback:\nIn the real world I'm sure the people in the real world will give you feedback in the real world.\nIn the real world, the only feedback you have access to is your own.\nIn the real, real world, you can never answer a question perfectly...", "answer": "D: theater"}

Since the yellow color starts each scene, the film has about 4.5 minutes of black screen time before it begins to show a scene.\nWhy would there only be 4.5 minutes of that when a character does a scene? Because people were watching the TV (or a movie) the past 4.5 minutes when a character showed up on the screen. When they saw the scene, they went back to watching the TV or movie while the image on the screen continued to update.\n\nInput: When a character does a scene, the screen changes from white to yellow.

That person then read all the names off the list and wrote them down. The dentist then asked the patient to find the dentist who gave him all of those experiences. The person then told the dentist he had to find him in the list and was asked to count the names. The dentist told the patient to count the number of times the name came up and the dentist could see how many times the name came up before John had written down the name. The dentist told the person that if it was the dentist who treated John, John had to pay him 10 times the amount the dentist gave him. The patient then told the dentist he could use one hand and make 10 calculations to figure out the amount, and it was obvious that the dentist had his calculations completely wrong.

The answer is 100. Therefore: If 10,00,000 humans are born, then the chances of a human having a brain tumor is 10,001,000/100 = 1/100,000. So the first question is \"How big is the brain\"? The second question is \"What is the probability that a person will die of brain cancer?\". The third question is \"Suppose the probabilities of both brain cancer and brain tumors are 100%, then the chances that a person will die are therefore 100,000,000/100 = 100,000,000-100 = 2/100,000\". The first, second, third, and a dozen other questions that follow this pattern are all \"How big is the square root of 100?\".\nOutput: A: If 10,000,000 humans were born, 100 would be a square root of 100 or 2 times the normal square root. Therefore, 100/100 is 1/100,000 or 2/100,000. Therefore, the square root of 100 is 100/100 or 2/100, 000 or 200.\nB: The square root of 100 is 2 x 10x10x10=2.4 or 2 \u00d7 10 / 2.4 = 1.8. Therefore, 1/100 of 100 is 100/1, 8 = 1/100.\nC: The square root of the square root of 100 does not have to be 2.4 or 2 \u00d7 2 = 1.8 because 1/3 of 100 = 1, a square root of 1,800! If someone did the same experiment with a square root of any other number, say 20, a square root of 20 would be just as likely to give the brain cancer as any other number. Therefore, since you have 2 \u00d7 20 in the square root, the square root of any number that has 20 as its smallest digit would be 2 \u00d7 20!

The company also offers to pay 60% of the salary of the remaining 40 workers to make sure they finish the carpeting. If the company hires 30 and the additional employees finish the carpeting then the flooring sells for $1,300 (30% + 40% = 80%).\nIf the company hires 100 new workers and produces 3 million square feet of flooring and sells it for $1,300 per square foot, the company will sell 1000 sq ft for $300 per square foot. With $300 per square foot as price, there are 2000 sq ft. Of that, the company will sell half to the carpets company and half to the factory. So the flooring company sells half of its production to one company which then purchases all of the flooring production from the factories, and the carpet companies sells half of their production to the other half of the company.\nThe total production cost is 2,900. Price of carpet: $300 / 1000 * $300 = $1,200 per sq ft.\n\nInput: John buys a car. He buys a new Toyota Camry for $27,500.

Your horse is more expensive at a stable\nSo the price of a stable is a bit higher.\nAt a race track you know that every weekend the horses of all colors will be racing\nSo there are only 300 stallions there. Horses from all colors will be competing for race track races.\nSo the cost of a stall at a stable is therefore 1000$ - 300 = 7000$ or 10000$ for the race track\nThe horse racing stall is therefore 1000$ - 3000 = 1020E, 1020E = 5E, or 5F.\nThe stall stall is therefore 7E - 5F > 5E.\nWhen your horse races at a race track they have 3 colors, black, blue, and silver. You can choose any color of silver horse you want to race. If you choose one color then all your horses running in the race must also be of that color\nNow when you go to your horse racing stable you have 5 colors and can choose any color horse you want (for your stall)\nSo when you run at a horse racing race track you might get black, blue, silver, green, red, or brown. If so all your horses racing in the race must also have the same coloring. In the same way when you go to your stable you might also get blue, silver, green..\nAny horse you can think of is possible to be there because the number of stallions is so few.\nYou may think that all horses should be the same color. But since no owner of a grey horse is allowed to have any other color than blue, only blue horses may be allowed\nAt Stable you know that your horses will start racing in the afternoon, when the color of the horse you want to bet on is going to be shown on the chart.

It hopes that if the project proves successful British citizens abroad will pay less in total taxes, thus increasing the efficiency of the health infrastructure. They will also pay less taxes if they move to the U.K.  The survey found that in many cases, the British will pay less in total, but if they leave they will pay the same in taxes they paid before.\nOutput: The health care bill\nfor the average Briton is $200.  The total tax bill for the average Briton overseas is $1,100.  Therefore, the average Briton overseas will pay $300 less in overall taxes compared to their current situation.  The net effect of this will increase GDP by 1.5%.\n\nInput:  The world population, including children, is growing rapidly and the population of people over the age of 15 will soon exceed the entire population of the United States.

Global population growth will peak again in 2100 before continuing on its trend until 2160 AD.  During this period, the world population will grow more rapidly than at any other time in history.\n\nInput: The average person weighs about 140 pounds.  The average person can carry this weight 20 hours.  The typical person will not be able to use the whole 20 hours of his capacity  because he has to spend this time performing a special activity with the use of his arms or some other means.  So 20 hours worth of normal activity can be done a person with very light and weak arms.\nOutput:  After carrying 120 pounds for 20 hours a person will be able to go 10 hours between taking sips of water.  He will be able to move around normally and accomplish everything he was going to do before.  Therefore, even if it takes longer to get from one place to the next, the total time spent is less because of the time used for rest and relaxation.\nThe time spent on rest and relaxation is 20 * 2*20 = $160.00.\nSo it is only $160.00 worth of time that would need to be recuperated.\nThe net difference after 20 hours of normal activity is $60.00.\nTherefore, the net effect is $60", "answer": "C: get tired"}

What is the maximum profit the family could make if the company were to double each employee's salary?\nInput: The company's total profit could double for the first two employees at the company if they each contribute 10% of their income to the company's budget and 20% of total salaries.\nOutput: Double the current profit!\nDouble the profit is the expected profit of a company. If there were 3 employees in the family and the two employees each contributed 10% of income, the total profit received by the company would be 50%. This is greater than double (30*2) = 100%!\nSo the final answer will be 50!\n\nInput:A man walks into a bar carrying a large sack.

How many hours does this young man spend every day on phone calls and how many hours of his time does that cost him?\nOutput:The young man spends 3 hours per day on phone calls and 2 hours per day of that time is paid to his mother. Therefore, he is charging his mother 3.50*52=<<5.50*2=18>>18 dollars per day.\nBased on the cost of the lunch and phone calls, the young man is spending $4.50 per day on phone calls plus the $18 per day for his mother.\nBased on this analysis, the young man is costing his parents $18 per day just to keep his phone on a regular basis.\nTherefore, the cost of the phone must be $18 + $1.75 = $20.50 per day.\nBecause the young man phones his mother about every 15 or so minutes, that means he is costing his parents approximately $1.75 per minute.\nTherefore, the total cost of his phone calls is $5.50 per day. Therefore, he is costing the parents $5 per day.\nTherefore, the young man is cost $25 per day just to keep just the cost of his phone on a regular day. That is about $75 per month.\nTherefore, his parents are spending $25 per month just on his phone calls.\nTherefore, the amount of money his parents spend on his phone calls is about $200 per month\nTherefore, the amount they spend on his phone calls must be $50 per month.\nTherefore he is costing his parents $200 per month just to keep his phone phone number on a regular basis\nTherefore the cost to his parents is $200+50 x $75 = $550\nTherefore, the total monthly cost to his parents is a $550\nTherefore, an accurate estimate is $550\nThat is equivalent of $650 per month at $1.75 per hour per caller just to keep his phone number on a regular day.\nTherefore his parents do not pay $650 per month for him to call, just to keep his phone.

How much does the salesman make?\nOutput: The salesman earns $100 on 4 / 2 = <<2/2+2/2=7>>7\nUsing the sales figures, it is found that 3/2 is 7, so a + 1/4 = 7.\nTo find a 3/2 plus 1/4 result, the following is needed:\n1) A+2/2 + 1/4 = 3/2\n2) A+2/4 + 1/4 = 1/4\n3) A+1/4 + 4/4 = 1/2\n4) A+1/2 + 4/2 = 1/2.\nSince the salesman made $100 on the sale and made no gain on the sale of the $50, he is paid $30. As long as the sales continue to average $2/sale, he must break even with the $50 gain. This is $50 divided by 5 = $150.\nTo obtain the $150 profit figure, it is first assumed that there will be 5 sales a week (5 per week), for a total of 16 sales a month. It is then assumed that every month $15 will be paid to the salesman. Since sales are $2/sale per month, it takes 5 months for the total gain to reach $150.*$150 = $25 = $75\n*Assuming each sale is purchased each month and the profit per sale is $75*$50 sales, $75*$25 sales = $150*$75 sales per month, = $150/2 = $30\nTherefore, if the salesman does not sell more than 0.5% of the items that come on the store shelves, the $150 profit figure is reached.\nSo the final price of the product sold is $150 x 0.5% = $300 = $75. The total cost of the product sold is thus:\n300 + 0.5% = 300 + $75 = $225 (The salesman sold the product for $75)\nIn short, the salesman's product is sold for $225.

{"text": "Too many people want exotic reptiles. Some people are unwilling to buy exotic snakes, such as the Chinese. If the demand isn\u2019t met, the supply must be cut and the number of snakes in circulation reduced. To do this, people who import exotic snakes must become prohibited. To cut the snake trade, the prohibition must be lifted.\nFirst, let's set the supply and demand for snake pet supply:\nSupply: 10,000,000,000 snakes\nDemand: 3,000,000,00 snakes\nThe first goal is to reduce the supply of snake pet supplies. To do this, a worldwide ban must be placed on all exotic animal trade. To do this, the prohibition must be enforced. The only way to enforce the prohibition is by removing the export licenses for pet snakes from countries where exotic animal trade is banned.  At a minimum, all export licenses must be revoked. Then, the snakes in circulation must be reduced to a single country.\nSecond, the snakes must be available. The best way to make exotic pet supplies available is to place the ban on non-exotic snakes and a ban on exotic snakes.  The only way to enforce this is to increase trade in exotic animals.  Exotic snake pet supplies must be imported and then exported.\nThird, the people must be made aware. The worst way to spread knowledge about the snakes was by keeping strict tablings.  Tabling is prohibited and most pet stores will not sell exotic snakes. The only way to spread the word is to inform people in advance that exotic snakes will be unavailable.  After the ban is instituted, people who import snakes can become prohibited.  Anyone who sells non-exotic snakes can become prohibited.\nFourth, the pet owners must be made aware that exotic pets are banned. To make exotic pet owners aware of the prohibition, pet stores should advertise it. Pets stores who do not advertise that exotic pet supply stores will be prohibited can be fined up to ten thousand dollars.\nFifth, the enforcement mechanism must be enforced.  The best way for enforcement is to use the pet trade monitoring agency. Exotic snake pet supplies can be tracked when they are exported. A monitoring agency can be formed to keep track of the export licenses and to see whether the snakes are being traded.  Exotic snake owners can be prosecuted.\nSixth, the enforcement methods and activities have to be implemented.  The number of snakes must be counted. Exotic snake owners should be required to register with local enforcement", "answer": "D: pet shops"}

C's response should be more logical than A's. C's answer will be \"This is wrong. I know how to solve it.\" This is because A's last equation needs to be changed so that he solves both problems. A C must know how to solve C's problem. However, A and C should understand each other with Mr. B's problem set. How could C explain how he solved Mr. A's problem? Could he give step by step on how he solved it? Could he explain if the answer is the same each time he does it. B should also do the same thing, but in C's case he would need to explain how he solved B's problem. C should say that he has always solved this problem before, but has never done it with the same answer every time. C can say that by the third time he solves the problem he will always answer the same way C does now. A can also say that if Mr. A and C do the same thing he has already solved two problems before. That means that B and C know how to solve it each time before they ask the question. B should explain how he solved the problem last time. C should have to say that how he solved C", "answer": "C: millpond"}

It is empty. How many people had dinner at your house on Sunday night?\nOutput: 1*x^2 + x^2 - x = 1\nThat means that you had 1 more person at your house each day than you did on Saturday. So the total number of people at your house was 2 + 1 = 3, which is 2/x = 0.03\nSo that is the number of people at your home during the week who had dinner on Sunday.\nThe number of people is: 1*{x^2 + 1/x} = 1\nSo the number of people at home on Sunday is 3 * {x^2 + 1} = 3 * x = 0.03\n\nInput: If the number of passengers in a car is 1, how many seats are available in the car?

He got out of bed, grabbed his clothes and followed the rest of the family back to bed. To get back to sleep, Stanley had to see and experience what had happened in his dream. He must be aware of what really happened, and Stanley had to wake himself up to do this.

{"text": "I don't know\nThe correct answer is 1\nThe final answer is 3\n\nOutput:A teacher is giving a lesson on multiplication. She gives three children a long list of common operations and a list of multiplication steps. They are each given a pencil in addition. At the end of the lesson, the teacher asks the children what number the pencil was when they were given it. All the children but one say 4; the others say 5; all say 6. She asks the others how many times 3 is repeated, and they say 10. So the teacher gives each of the children 10 + 3 = 12; the other children receive 12 * 3 = 20; the teacher gives each of them 12 * 1/2 = 40, and the last child receives 40 * 1/4 = 52. For the teacher, 30 = 15 + 15 * 3 = 40 x 2 = 60. So each of the students received 60 by using the formula 30 = 15 + 15 = 40 x 2 + 3 = 60. For the teacher, 20 = 15 + 20 * 3 = 60 x 2 = 60 x 2 = 72. For the teacher, 12 = 15 * 3 = 12 x 2 = 72 x 2 = 192. So each of the children received 192 by using the formula 20 = 15 * 3 = 192 x 2 = 192 x 2 = 96 x 2 = 120 x 2 = 144 x 2 = 192 x 3 = 180 x 2 = 160 x 2 = 192 x 8 = 720 x 16 = 1800 x 2 = 1980 x 2 = 3000 x 2 = 3600 x 2 = 5000 x 2 = 3600 * 2 = 72000 x 2 = 300000 x 2 = 36000 * 2 = 120000 x 2 = 240000 x 2 = 360000\nInput:Three of the children know how many times four times four is repeated, but two of them don't.

Adam needed three chickens, three ducks, three hens, and one rooster to get the eggs. One hen came home with an extra egg.  If the other hen came home with an egg from a different hen, how many eggs did Adam get?\nOutput:   Adam got ten eggs.  Since one egg came home with an extra one, Adam got 14 + 4 = <<14+4=22>>22 eggs\nTwo extra eggs came in addition to the ten he got.  Since one egg went home with the extra one, Adam got 30 + 4 = <<30+4=36>>36 eggs\nOne extra egg came home with the extra one and Adam got 38 + 4 = <<38+4=50>>50 eggs\nThree extra eggs came home with the extra egg and Adam got 56 + 4 = <<56+4=71>>71 eggs\nNone of his extra eggs came home with an extra-one.  He has 6 * 52 = <<56+12=72>>72 eggs remaining.\nAltogether, Adam got 36 + 36 + 36 = <<36+36=90>>90 eggs.\nThe extra eggs gave him 76 + 36 + 36 = 10 * 108 = 110 eggs.\nThe ten extra eggs gave him 110 + 8 * 108 = 220 eggs\nThe ten extra eggs plus the ten extra eggs gave him 44 + 8 * 108 = 56 * 108 = 456 eggs\nSo the final answer for Adam is 456 * 108 = 1114 eggs\nThe extra eggs gave Adam 456 * 108 = 1174 eggs.\nThe extra-one egg and the ten extra-ones gave him 1017 eggs.\nSo the final number for Adam is 1017 / 4 = 11.\n\nOutput: The students had two tasks.

If a 10,000-dollar loan with a 10-year term costs an interest rate of 10.00%, why can't a 10,000-pound car cost a 10,000-ton rate? Answer: The answer is that the car's weight is not constant, as it is moving.

A: about 9 years B: about 27 years C: about 1 month D: about 45 days E: about 5 years.\nOutput:About 1.5 years\nThis is the last question.\n\nInput and Output: This is a very simple game, but you cant pick an integer that is not a prime factor of 5. The first question is whether you can pick an integer between 2 and 5 (and possibly 1 and, IIRC, some other integers). I think you cant (but dont quote me on that), the second question is whether you can find an arbitrary power of 3 by taking the square of the factor to be, say, 9 = 9 and then adding it back to 2, or if the sum of the values is greater than 3 * 10 = 19, or whatnot.\nYou dont need to know the answer for the third question.\n\nInput is the number of people in a house. Output is the number of people that are more than 2 people or less than or equal to 2 people. There are five people in the house. When there are ten people in the house, you do not have a fifth person. Now, when there are four people in the house, there is a fifth person (which is 2 plus 5 minus 25). Then there are three people in the house (two is 7 divided by 5). When there are four people in a house that would be 9 plus, say, 1 equals 5, 3 * 6 = 11 is 5. So 8 when it is a group of 10. The question becomes what is the number of rooms in a house.\nOutput is 7 * 5 = 42, 9 = 5 times 42 (41,6).\nSo 7 - 5 = 3 plus one\n7 - 4 = 16\n7 + 7 = 24\n7 + 7 * 30 = 31 times 42\nSo there are 31 times 42 * 30 = 51 times 91\n\nInput is how many people are on the bridge.

All dogs start at one month old (30 days). All dogs age 1 year at 6 months. If your dog is five months old, your dog may respond differently as an adult than if he is 3 months old. Your dog is not one hundred percent sure of himself as an adult. You asked him if he would stop barking when you told him to when you first took him and then you had him on a leash, but after that you had him on a lead. He stopped barking when you told him and then you let him off the leash. Now you want to take him out on a lead and see if he will really stop barking. For you as well as other dog owners who live in suburban areas, having a dog on a lead increases your dog's chance of being chased by other dogs or car drivers. When you take dogs off the leash, they may get back on the leash or they may pull more than usual. If your dog pulls, you don't want to let him pull, but if he stops barking you don't want to take him off the lead either. If you take your dog off the lead, it is likely his behavior will continue to worsen. Your dog may bark at strangers when out on the lead or he may chase birds. You may have to lead him back to you before you let him off the lead. Your dog must do better and he is going to have to try a lot harder to please you.\n\nInput: You can make money by taking your dog for a walk and asking pet owners next to you for a treat.

B: The problem is an evaluation of the teacher\u2019s teaching ability. Since the teacher said she was a jerk, the student probably assumes she is a jerk. C: The student and teacher could be talking about the different student\u2019s behavior or experiences. But the teacher really doesn\u2019t have much information about the student\u2019s experiences or behaviors, so he doesn\u2019t have any reason to think the student is a jerk.

He could be a brilliant teacher in spite of the student being a jerk, although Jordan probably doesn\u2019t know who he is.\nAnalysis of the answer: A: There is something of this nature going on.

If the answer is 95 - 40 = 85 percent of the students do not finish their homework before 2 a.m., why might some students not perform better at sleep-deprived homes? (Answer these questions to find out.)\nOutput: On Tuesday night, the sleep-deprived homes practice is scheduled for 2:30.  This practice is not done between 2-3 p.m., so the rest of the students practice starts at 9 p.m.  As for homework performance, homework scores tend to be between 15 and 30 percent on Tuesday nights.  As students go to bed Saturday mornings, homework scores drop below 10 percent.  When the students wake up on Sunday mornings, homework scores return to normal.\n\nInput:On a Friday night, students are expected to bring in 25 books. Five are returned on Monday morning and the other twenty-five will remain overnight. If you put all those books on one cart, how many cartons were there overall? Also, who did the students make return those books? If they are returning books from the library, how many are actually from the library?  How many of those 25 books are from college?\nOutput:The students put the books into two cartons that fit on the bus.  The students who don't return books from the library make the return trips.  There were 25 cartons between the students' homes and the bus on Friday night.  When the students get home on the following Monday morning, 19 of those books are returned from the library.  So the final answer is 11\n\nInput:What was the greatest change in the average IQ test score", "answer": "C: party"}

The price of a new iPod Touch is $599. In a yard sale, the iPod has been priced for $100. On September 26, the iPod has been sold for $200. In a yard sale in 2010, the price of the iPods will sell for $200 and the price of the iphones will sell for $9999. The difference is $3.50. When it costs $500 to replace the batteries in the iphone, the iphone has a greater value than an iPod. The money earned from the sale is $500 x 3 = $1500.

By how much?\nOutput: Since each bottle of liquor was purchased with an average of $50 every week, $50 - $63 = <<57*60=48>>48 dollars.\nThis means they would have spent exactly $48 dollars more per week than they actually did.\nSince $48 dollars is a lot of money to spend on one bottle of liquor in just 48 days, imagine what it would take them to complete the task over an entire year.\nTo put it in perspective, if they had bought 10 bottles of alcohol every day for a year instead of each bottle every week, they would be spending $200 dollars per month. They would spend $1,200 dollars in one year.\nSo the final amount of alcohol they would need to buy would be $10,000\n\nInput:  If Jordan, Sally, and Perry had bought 25,000 bottles of liquor each in 2012, they would spent exactly the same amount of money in alcohol, but they would have spent exactly 3,000 days in each year on alcohol. By how much would this be true? Output:  If they had bought 25 bottles of liquor per day during the year, they would have spend $4,500-$8,000 dollars on alcohol, respectively\nThis means they would spend $0.64 times 3 times 4 = $12,000.\nA bottle of liquor takes $120 each day. So if they spend $12,000 per year on alcohol (or $120/day on alcohol), that means they spent 4 times $120 in 365 days.\nAltogether, $40,000 in three years is $12,000 x $120 = $40,000 per year\n\nInput:If", "answer": "D: happiness"}

Output:\n( $100 - $1) + (+ $100 * $1.00) = ( $ 100 - $1.00 ) - ( $ 100 * 2) + (+ $100) * 2 = ( $100 - $2) - ( $100 * 4) + (+ $100), * 1.2 = ( $ 100 - 1.04) + (- $100), * 1 = 12 dollars.\nIn case the answer is not obvious, the answer is $100\nSubtracting ( $100) + ( ($100 + 1 ) = 12 dollars), - (- ( $100 - 1 ) - 0), ( $100 - 5 ) = ( $ 100 - 5 ) + (- $2), = 12 dollars.\nTherefore, the total pay out day was $100 - (( $100 ) + ($100 + 1 )) = ($100 - 12 ), = $100.\nThis is the right answer\n\nInput: On two separate days in a row, two people went on a shopping spree.

{"text": "On Monday morning, Sarah spent only half of the time that the teacher said she had.  On Tuesday morning, she spent half the time that she said she had and an extra half hour.  On Wednesday morning, the teacher said that Sarah should be gone, as she did not look out the window for an hour before school let out at 10 o'clock.  Sarah actually spent just over a half hour outside, during which time she found out that the teacher had come by to give her an estimate of the amount of work that had to been done.  Sarah spent an extra hour at school which left her with 5 * 12 = <<5+12=27>>27 extra minutes of time.   This means that Sarah had an extra 5 minutes to leave the building each day.  It would have been worth more time for Sarah if she had spent the extra 5 minutes doing something useful like studying for a midterm exam.  However, she found out that the time given her was not enough to allow her to do that well- so to speak.  She spent the rest of the time cleaning, which she found out was not very useful either.

However its worth more because she never planned for not spending time outside after being outside when she was supposed to get to leave.

How many tickets will she receive?\nOutput: Eight will be issued\nThere are nine seats on the bus, and one passenger will be receiving tickets in the order that she is on the bus.\nFrom the first person to board the bus, there are eight tickets for the first six passengers in the sequence listed. The ninth seat will be awarded to the last passenger in the sequence listed. Therefore, all nine seats will be taken up by the end of the bus journey, so that there are only eight tickets for passengers 1 to 10.\nHowever, there are only eight seats left in the sequence. If there were ten people on board the bus, then eleven tickets would have been issued for passengers 1 through 10. Therefore, if there are eleven people on board the bus or more, then there is a larger crowd, and the number of tickets distributed over the length of the journey becomes smaller. The amount of tickets distributed over the journey must therefore be equal to four*10/16. Therefore, from the first person to board she will receive eight tickets, and, from the last passenger to board three tickets. This completes one side of the trip.\nOutput: The number of tickets distributed on the journey is equal to four*10^16.\nFrom the first passenger to board the bus, she will receive eight tickets. From the last passenger to board she will receive three tickets. This completes the second side of the journey.\n\nInput:If 10 people were to get on a train, who would be the last person to get on?\nOutput:There would", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}

The first order of business is to determine what treatments are the most effective. If you have time, you can ask your patients what medications they take and which ones they dislike. If that's not possible, you can look up current medications and try to prescribe similar drugs that were tried before, but didn't work out. What if none of your patients have taken any medications recently? What can you do instead of figuring out which medications to prescribe? This type of question is different than the type on \"When you were a child, what toy did you hate?\" What do you do about that question? This type of questions can be quite interesting if you're good at thinking quickly and are able to quickly figure out the answer. You may need an example of a good question, but usually, you don't need to write out a full essay to write this type of answer. In this case you'll probably need to write 4-6 sentences and you can always rewrite the answer as you get more and more information. Some things you'll need to do before writing your answer: Write down what medications or drugs your patients take, what they do, and why they do it. Now that you've written your answer, you should have an idea of what would be possible to prescribe. If your answer is different from the prescription in the prescription book, you may not be able to recommend a drug. If you're not sure about something, you probably have an opening \"for experimentation.\" Write some thoughts to fill out the rest of your answer. This is only one type of answer to this question, but there are many more in this question. You can also make use of a tool called a tool box.

{"text": "One that appreciates people who love him, gives generously, leads a balanced life, doesn't do anything selfish, etc.\n\nIn my experience, you're looking for the perfect example of each option, and it isn't easy to find one. It makes more sense to try to choose a perfect option out of each option and see which one is best, or at least how it fits the other options. In other words, choose the best option but choose it with the rest of the data.\n\nLet's try to find an example of each one, in response to what was asked.\n\nThe most basic example is a very simple question, \"How likely was it that Jordan had two fish at the same time?\" To find an answer such as \"not too likely,\" you'd need lots of data. In any particular week, you'd want to go through all the data, pick an average, and then plot that average to see if there were statistically significant events.\n\nFor example, suppose I am a data expert, and for any week, I can find a data point on any other week so I have a really good average to base off of. Thus, I can find Jordan has 2 fish at once one week, and then he has 2 fish twice the next week. My average should be that there are 2 fish at once, every week, 1 out of every 3 weeks. Now, I can just find one week where there are no fish at all, but the average shows there are 2 fish at anytime.\n\nSince you really want the first step, you can just plot the average for 2 weeks of data over 2 months of data. Thus, your average should show there are exactly 2 fish at any given time. That's an average of 2 * 3 * 8 = 16 fish for the entire 2 months. Again, as a data expert, I can find a very detailed record of exactly which date any given week corresponds with the best average.\n\nYou can compare any other average to this average, and you can plot the data to get a plot of the \"true\" average. This is then a pretty good proxy for whether it was likely Jordan had 2 fish at the same time at all. So, if we're allowed to find Jordan having 2 fish at once, then the first question we're thinking about is: \"how likely is it he had 2 fish at once?\" The answer is, \"not too likely.\" Of course, it is very unlikely to have 2 fish at once", "answer": "A: joy"}

A person will tell you they are sick but they don't realize that they are sick in another way. In other words, they say they are sick and their intentions are good.\nOutput:There is no reason to say you are sick. I never say I'm sick. I am sick, but in different ways.

It would be much worse for the other poor people if they had to care for them.\" It is hard to care for someone who is too sick because you can't help. It is difficult to care for someone who can't help you because it requires a lot of energy and time to give to someone who cannot help themselves.\nThe person telling you that they are sick may say they are sick in a good way.

The hurricane's winds are the average wind speeds when the storm made landfall (i.e., it was about a mile high) on September 11, 1973. This average (averaged over the previous 4 years) was 35 mph. So the hurricane's winds were estimated to be 35/1500 = 20 mph.\nInput:The hurricane's winds are not necessarily the same as the \"average wind speed of hurricane\" (assuming there is no hurricane on the same day as the one that made landfall). If there is no hurricane but the wind speed for the storm is higher, hurricane winds may not be affected even if the storm is named. However, if the storm was a \"Category 2\", the winds would be significantly higher than the \"average\" hurricane winds. Since hurricanes don't have \"average\" winds, and the Category 3 hurricane on September 11 is classified as the most powerful hurricane ever recorded, the Category 3 hurricane wind speed on September 11 is not the \"average\" hurricane wind speed. Because of this, there is no \"average wind speed\" for hurricane landfall.\nInput:The first hurricane on September 11 was classified by the United States Weather Bureau as a Category 1 hurricane.

If there are more results, that is more possible bets. The answer to the question is C\n\nInput The amount in the pot is $100 if a team won a bet, then $200 if they lost. A member makes a bet that if Chicago wins, he will buy two bottles of beer from an adjacent bar. If Chicago loses, he must pay one of the two beers, regardless of how much he has won. The other player then makes the bet that if Chicago wins he will sell two bottles of beer at the same price in the opposite bar. The bets make a total of $100.\nOutput The total amount in the pot is the bet's value times the person's money, plus the amount of beer the person won.\nThe question gives each player one beer and asks the following question.\n\nInput The amount of money is $100. The player bets $50 that if Chicago loses, he will buy two beers in the tavern next door to his house. If Chicago wins, he must pay $30 of the beers to the bar next door before giving the other $30 to the player next door.\nOutput The total money in the pot is the drink price times the amount the player won. It would appear that since the bar would buy the beer for each player, that he would be paying $100 for his $50.\nThe bet states that Chicago should buy the beers for $30 each, since the player won $50. Since each player played a $50 wager, it would appear that they should pay $30 each to the nearest bar.\nAs a result, the $100 wager states that if Chicago loses, the first $30 of the beer is", "answer": "B: populated area"}

This would be much easier. But I feel like short time scales are easy to use because of the way we already think about problems. So how do use these kinds of problems? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nInput: A person and another person were walking to work. The other person had a dog with the dog walker. They stopped for about 5 minutes before they started running. But the 5 minute rule doesn\u2019t apply to this situation. How can the second person, and thus everyone else, not have to stop the first person?\nOutput: If the other person stopped the first person running, everyone would stop as well, but no one would get off. There should be 2, 3, etc, more people standing because the first person won\u2019t slow down to get off. So the second person should be walking towards the rest of the group, not walking backwards like the first person is. And they should run forward after the first person finishes, not after the dog walker. As in the first person\u2019s case: if the person behind the first person stopped the dog walker, everyone behind should finish with the dog walker as well. Then when you are done, everyone should walk forward together, not backward.\n\nInput: The dog is running to fast for the people to catch up. The dog has to stop running or the people will be killed. They have one minute and must run fast. They have two minutes", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}
{"text": "A: secular  B: short term C: crowd D: unpredictable\nA secular party is held once a year on January 13th.  The party starts at 6am and lasts till 8pm.\nA church holds a secular party twice a year. The first party typically lasts for 10 hours and the second party lasts up to 3 hours.  Each party attracts a different crowd.  It's hard to tell if secular parties have grown or shrunk as a result of secular culture.  There is evidence that secular parties are growing.\nThe church that is holding their yearly secular party on January 13th has a very crowded crowd.  Approximately 50 people show up to the church at 6am and do not leave till 8pm.\nThe church who holds their secular party 3 hours later holds very few people.  There are maybe 20-25 people at the church at 6am. The party lasts until 6pm.  The most people to show up to the church's secular party in a single day is probably 5 people.\nAnother secular party that is held on a different day of the week is held 4 weeks after Christian birtdays. Approximately 200 show up to the party at 1:30pm on Sunday and 2 weeks later on October 12th.  Both secular parties are very crowded.  There's a good chance that Christian-curious people will want to attend secular parties for some time in the future.\nAs secular culture continues to flourish, the secular party will eventually become less congested.  The church that holds their secular party every January 13th is likely to hold an equally crowded and crowded secular party every February 13th on the same day.\n\nInput: A married woman gave birth to an embryo.

Outline:  He needs to make no more money\nOutput: Joe needs to save at least $45 per week\nSo how much money is Joe saving?\nHe saves at least 25 hours per week\nAt least 25 hours per week = 35 minutes for 35 days per week\nSo how does Joe save 35 minutes per week?  30 hours per week = 45 minutes for 45 days per week.\nSo how much time does Joe save?  45 minutes less than 35 minutes = 35 minutes less than 45 days per week = 35 minutes of saving\nSo the total amount of $35 saved per week = = 35 minutes less than $35 dollars saved per week = 35 minutes spent saving = 35 minutes less than one hour of lost time\nSo Joe saved one hour per week\nSo the total amount saved by one hour per week = one hour of $35 dollars saved = one hour $35 dollars were saved each week\nSo this works out to be 35 minutes each week.\nSo the total amount spent saving = $35 dollars spent per week = $35 dollars spent each day = $35 dollars spent daily.\nSo the total saved each day = $35 hours saved per week = $365 dollars saved per week = $1.4 in one day saved.\nThis works out to 36 hours saved.\nSo 36 hours per day per week = 36 hours saved per day = $1.5 in one day saved.  This works out to $40 in one day.\nSo this adds up to $1.5 per day.\nSo Joe saved $40 per day.\nThis makes Joe $40 in one day\nThis means Joe spent $40 in one day per day = $40 dollars spent per week.\nSo the overall savings so far = $40 dollars spent each day = 40 dollars per day = 40 per week = 40 $$$ dollars saved = $100\nSo Joe saved $100 per week.  That means he saved $100 in one week.\nSo Joe saved an hourly rate per day", "answer": "C: being found out"}

The customers sometimes made trouble.  One day, three gentlemen approached him, asking John for a coffee.  One of the three asked if John was a pastor and if he could help them.  Both asked John for money and after John refused, gave him a pair of brass knuckles.  The two brothers then forced John onto a motorcycle and sped off with his coffee.  When they caught John's motorcycle, they took all of his coffee in their hands but still wanted him to give him his money to.  John responded with a pistol.  The men took off with his coffee, but eventually they got separated and returned to their car.  In the car, John and the brother exchanged a few words that were said to be in Spanish.  At this point, more of the men began to arrive at the station to pick him up.  A large mob of men then came to the police and said that John had \"assaulted a pastor.\"  In fear of his life, John called 911 as they drove off the road onto a gravel road where an officer was waiting.  John was able to escape the car's wheels and continue driving and eventually ended up in the station lot.  The men who had attacked him could not catch him and he eventually escaped with his coffee.  He then tried to get in the police car but the officer locked the doors and called the police to his side.  The men who were trying to pull him out of the car opened the back doors and attempted to force him out of the car, but the doors were able to slam closed on their heads while they were still trapped in the car.  After leaving the store he drove home and left his coffee in a flower pot that he placed on the porch.  He did not open his door a crack when he drove home but was able to get in through the door which had been left ajar.  On his drive home, he also went through his car window to check his car to see if a man or men had been there.

{"text": "Air that has been breathed recently has most likely been breathed by people in the room. This means it has been breathed in at least twice recently.\nOutput: Air that is breathable by only a few people lately has most likely been breathed in at least once before.\nThis is confirmed when air is not breathable for more than 5 minutes and then when it is breathable for less than 5 minutes.\nNote that it only has been breathable for five minutes during the last 7 days. So it is confirmed as being breathed in during the past seven days.\nSo air that has been breathed recently only has been breathable during the past seven days\nSo air that was breathed during the past seven days contains less than ten percent of the amount needed by all ten people. This therefore means that air that has been breathed during the past seven day has less than one percent of the air needed by all ten people, making it inhaled by at least ten people. However, if you try breathing more than ten people's air at a time, your lungs will quickly tire and then you'll inhale less people's breath. So it's important to practice healthy air breathing techniques that won't make your lungs tired soon.\nOutput: Air which has been breathed recently has only been breathed in during the past four minutes and the past three minutes.\nAltogether, air that has been breathed since November has only been breathed in four minutes and three minutes.\nSo air which has been breathed since November cannot have that much air that the rest of it hasn't already been breathed.\nOutput:The total amount of air which has been breathable by at least 10 people lately has been breathed in at most ten more of days.

The cost to build the new bridge is two dollars. What is the new bridge's price? Select the appropriate answer:\n\nOutput: The price of the new bridge is $2.00.\nIf you take away the cost of the old bridge, $1.00 will be left. So the cost to build the new one is $1.50.\nSo the new bridge will cost $2.50 to remove and $1.50 to build.\nSo the new one has an overall cost of $1.50. It's total price is $2.00, less $1.50. So the bridge is $1.50 more expensive than the old one.\nSo the new cost is $2.00 over the $1.50 cost.\nOn average, the price of the new one is $0.50 higher than the old one. So total cost is $2.50.\nSo total cost is $2 + $1.50 = >$3.\nTotal cost is an average of $2 + $1 + $1 = $3.50!\nSo the total cost of the new bridge is at least $2.50 more than the old one!\nThe new bridge is only $1.", "answer": "E: business meeting"}

Is it the age or is it something else?\nInput:John has watched the films that require an age 9 and above in the same theater. On his way back to the car after the film, he heard himself say in the back of his mind that these films weren\u2019t suitable for a younger audience. On the way back in to the theater to the same film, he felt miserable.\nOutput:\nSince his daughter is only 9, and the films weren\u2019t appropriate for her age, John\u2019s class is going to not watch them anymore. The films will be shown in the same theater or with the parents and children in age-appropriate theaters.\nThe solution John has found for his friend and classmate who was unhappy with the films that require an an age 9 to watch them is for the two of them to join with the other older patrons and not watch the films in the same theater that require them to be 9 or older\nThe original film that John was referring to is: \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\"\nThe solution he has found for his friend: a friend with an 11+ year-old daughter\nJohn & John have gone to the same theater for the last 4 films and have never felt unhappy or depressed after seeing them\nTheir parents had not expressed the feelings to John that they were upset the films wouldn't be watched, but the two of them were making a decision that their daughter will not continue to be miserable when watching films in an age appropriate theater.\nThe original film that he was referring to is: A Nightmare on Elm Street\nThe solution he has decided to use is as follows: have only the 3 of them join with the other people in age-appropriate theaters for the films that require an older audience\nSince John watches the films that require an adult audience in the same theater, his school and John\u2019s friend\u2019s school are working together to change his school\u2019s scheduling of the film that requires an age 9 or younger to not show them if they don\u2019", "answer": "E: breathe deeply"}

{"text": "On a tropical fruit tree, a ficus plant looks like a small elephant\nThe most common tropical fruit tree in the world is the coconut. The most common fruit trees in the world are the banana and the mango tree. If you have no tropical fruit trees in your yard, which fruit tree do you keep in your backyard?\nA typical tropical fruit tree can grow up to 6 to 12 feet tall and produces thousands of fruit. If you want only one fruit tree, what is it you want it to produce? The main tree in the southern hemisphere is the peach tree. In the northern hemisphere, most fruit trees are in the peach tree family. The banana and mango trees can weigh up to 50 pounds in fruit. The fruit is generally green or yellowish in color and sometimes have brown or light green centers. The fruit grows on thick, woody stalks. The fruit is small and can be eaten as a fruit or dried as a fruit peel. In the middle east or middle east-style, a large, round tree is more suitable.\nThe fruit tastes good when it is ripe and it is used to make juice. However, dried fruit, particularly if you eat the flesh, is a bit bitter. If you are not familiar with eating fruit, the flavor does not change after it has been eaten, it is only the texture.\nOn their property there is a mango tree in the middle east style. It is a small, round, green fruit tree. You can eat the fruit in the summer and then you keep the rest in the refrigerator for later usage. Or you can dry the mango fruit in the sun for winter use. The tree produces up to 10 fruit a day after rain. If the fruit is too ripe, you can cut off the ends and store them in a freezer. The fruit will freeze well for storage.\nThe banana or peach tree on another island in the southern hemisphere produces fruit all year long. The peach tree produces a thick, oval fruit called a mango, green or brown in color. The fruit is usually soft and chewy. It is used all around the world as food and is an important part of the diet in many parts of the world. The mango fruit tree is usually more mature than the banana tree and has smaller fruit. The mango fruit tree has been called the sweetest fruit by many people. Mangoes are very heavy feeders and can grow up to 5 feet tall and spread out of control. When they are ripe, they produce an odor offensive to dogs and other animals", "answer": "E: apartment"}

{"text": "Why might a person get counseling? Choices A: to be heard and receive gifts B: to understand themselves C: good things in life D: acknowledgment\nThe number of good things a person gets by getting counseling would be the number of people in the counseling group that give good things to that person by giving counseling. The number of counselors that give good things to the counselor is called the good-luck pool. The number of counseling people that give good things to each other by giving counseling is called the counseling staff.\nSo at a rate of 4 people giving good things to each other, the number of counselors, giving good things, would be 4x4. So the number of counselors would increase 4x4 + 4x4 = 8x6. So the number of good things would increase 8x6 = 24x4.\nIf counseling is good for a person\u2019s happiness, then the number of counselors would be 24x4. If counseling is not good for a person\u2018s happiness, then the counseling number of people would decrease 4x4 = 2x1 = 1/3 =.\nSo one counselor, giving good things and leaving the door open, is responsible for the number of counseling staff people.

{"text": "If I wanted to see a lizards natural habitat, I would go to the US and go to Utah. There is a lizard in Utah called the black gopher tortoise.\n\nThe lizard was first thought to have been in the north Atlantic and was found in the South Atlantic by a French pilot in 1881.  In 1902 the British caught an adult female in Newhaven, England.  She was named after an island in the Channel Islands. The name \"California lizard\" (calicotz or California lizard) is an allusion to her.  She was taken to a zoo, became popular, and was popular enough that when the British Antarctic Survey came to search for her in 1943 they also found her and released her where the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) had her first found.\n\nIn 1881 the original specimen was found in the Atlantic Ocean, although the authors state that it would appear to be far further south.  In 1902 the adult female was discovered in the South Atlantic Sea.  In 1906 it became the oldest living mammal.  In 1911 it was in Newhaven, England in the Channel Islands.  In 1951 the British Museum named it the African tortoise  because of the many species living along the South African coast.  In 1985 the European Commission named it the European tortoise because of its close association with people in Europe.  The only living species now known to be in Africa, according to the new species listing, is the  African tortoise.\n\nIn 2003 a female was found with both young and adults in Botswana.  She was still alive when the researchers found her. It is now thought, however, that the adult females have moved north because of a lack of food.  In 2005, when an adult was found at a zoo in Cape Town, South Africa, it was thought that it was also the youngest recorded adult female.

Why are there 6 fish in the same box?\nOutput:  When Sally picks up all 6 fish, how many bags do they need? The answer will also depend on what you include in the bag.\nOutput =  When every fish is in a bag, how many more bags do they need?  The answer also depends on what you include in each bag.\n Output = What is Sally's total weight for the 6 bags?\n Output =  At what speed does she pick up 6 fish? In each case, we assume that she picked up one fish at a time. That means that she picked up 1 fish in the first 1 second then a second fish in the next 1 second and a third fish in the next 1 sec, etc. In either case, she picks up 3 1/2 bags of fish, so she picks up 3 1 1/2 bags + 3 = 5 bags of fish.\nOutput = Do you need to put in some air in between the six fish? The answer will depend on whether you need to add air to any of the other bags. With all six fish in one bag, 3 bags are filled. With all six fish separate, how many bags need to be filled?\nOutput =  In addition to the 5 bags filled by Sally, what is her total weight?

A has invited B, but B cannot come as she was running away. On the second day, B came over to A house to eat on their porch. That day A's father would never allow A to host a party, because her father is very strict. What if B did not come last night but had arrived at 2:00 am and stayed all night? Would B's father have allowed A to host the party on a Tuesday because A had invited her friends B and was expecting them? Also consider the fact that A never told B about the Monday invite. If B had came to the party, would B would have said nothing and went to A's house on Tuesday? That could go against her word and she would not be allowed to host the next party. So even though B had come earlier than planned, due to her father she would soon be asked to host another party.

During that week, she will host a party at her home. B will come and A can host her.  This results in her making a total of 8 trips, in a row, to A family's house in the next 6 days.

And as she goes to her friend's home, she will have to make 6 trips to reach the next host, because she is expecting her friends B. So let's say A makes 2 trips to reach B, to get there by 4:00 PM.

A can't go there because there has been a huge fight with her parents over when can she host the next party.

{"text": "A: drink tea, thank god, open eyes, feel angry, complete sentence\nThis is not the same as the question given above, but the purpose of this exercise is to learn what we will do when we wake up.\nInput: What is a person who just woke up to do?\nOutput: Get up, tea, thank God, open eyes, feel anger, complete sentence\nThe people in the picture on the right could make three choices in this game:\nA: Drink tea B: Thank god C: Open eyes D: Complete sentence\nIn real life, we cannot do all of those things at once. We might want to open our eyes first, take a drink of tea, and thank God. We would probably not wake up if we just started all three of those things at once, but we could each do one of those things after the other.\nFor example let's say we wake up to start typing, but first we get a cup of tea. I don't think we could type for more than a few seconds without having to stop and swallow; therefore we have at least a few seconds to get things done. Let's also imagine someone says \"Thank God\" then does something else that they shouldn't be doing while still on this side of a coffee table, such as eating or holding a drink of Tea. This also limits our options for when we need to take a drink of Tea or when we need to complete the sentence. Therefore this part of the exercise is not the same as asking the same question.\n\nInput for: (1) What would a person do if they woke up?  (2) What would a person say after waking up?

He walks to the headquarters at 9:00 a.m. every day to go to work. It is 2 miles of walking to the main campus of the company that is 30 miles away. He walks 3 miles each way and takes another 30 minutes to get back to the beginning of his route. How many miles can Jack walk in a day and still finish his 4 mile route to the main campus?\nOutput: Jack is always on time for work, whether he walks 3 miles or 4 miles. If he stops for 30 minutes at 6 o'clock when he returns home he still completes his 4 mile route to work.\nHe has a 6 hour work day, works four hours and walks four miles to and from work during the day. If he stops for a nap or lunch at 2:30 and walks 3 miles back home at 5:00, he still completes his route in six and a half hours.\nSo the final average distance of the walks is 5 miles. He can cover 5 miles every day, no problem.\nSo the final amount of miles he must walk each day to complete his route is 3 x 5 x 12 = 75 miles.\nSo the final number of miles he must walk per day is 75/12 = 3 = 6.5 miles.\nA = 75/12 = 3\nB = 6.5\nC = 8\nD = 9\n\nInput: Jane, a registered nurse, has 40 patients in her ward each time she goes to check on them.

If the birth-death rate in the next 30 years remains the same, then there would be an increase from 326 million to 324+5 = 324m. The number of Germans who are living in the United States will remain the same because there are a total of 326+5 = 325 million people living in the United States, including the foreign born. But there are only 324+5 = 324 million people in Germany. So there will be an increase from 324+5 * 325+5 = 324 million.

{"text": "A is the normal sound, B is the snoring sound and C is the dreaming sound\n\nInput:When we go to bed, we breathe about 10 times a minute. What happens to the body when we are done breathing 10 times with each breath?\nOutput: When we go to sleep, there is a lot of blood in the body. The blood carries oxygen to all parts of the body. When we breathe 10 times with each breath, we only keep about 1/5 of the oxygen that would have been in the body had we only had 10 breaths in our lungs and only 8 in our bloodstream. The body takes one-fifth of whatever it takes from the bloodstream and the other half is oxygenated blood.\nSo what happens next? After 9 breaths our body starts burning our blood and producing new red blood cells. Since oxygen and blood are needed to do things in the body, this means that the body has lost oxygen very quickly and is beginning to burn the newly produced red blood cells, giving us our headache. It will take us another 9 breaths to get back to the level of oxygenation in the bloodstream at which we started off.

When people go to a museum they generally look at some of the exhibits first, then the animals, and then the animals again.\nA zoo may not allow people to look at zebrs in a zoo. A museum usually has a place where people can look at an animal exhibit. The Zebras would fit into the \"exhibits\" category, like a whale exhibit.\nSo why not choose B for the answer? Because a museum usually doesn't have a place where they can look at zebras. Some museums have a place where people can visit the exhibit in a different building and see a zebras exhibit, but the zebras do not get to be on display. Therefore I guess a museum, and a zoo are the only viable answers for zoo type questions\n\nInput: In the game \"What is the most efficient path?\", there are two options.

Today, we have many different kinds of shades of black and more colors of red. Some are thicker than others and some are more durable while other materials are more absorbent.\nOutput: Quilting paper can hold a pattern or design, but it does not have the ability to hold multiple images at once.

In one minute, the keeper manages to break free and swim away.\nIn three minutes, the keeper follows the other fish back to the same spot where it was first caught. The keeper sees the same spot and goes there too. The keeper meets the fish that was first caught. The two of them swim back where they were originally caught.  The fish that was caught 2 minutes ago, now has three sets of eyes, so it can not see what the fish in three minutes later is doing. In this case, the fish just swim by it and does nothing. The only way it can see is through a set of eyes which are already there, so it can\u2019t find another keeper or leave this set.\nThe fish that was caught one minute ago now has no eyes, but still has three sets of eyes. In one minute it can\u2019t see where it is being caught or follow another fish. It just swims by. The only way it will be able to do something is to swim in the same direction as the fish that was caught with the first set of eyes just a minute ago", "answer": "B: nodding"}

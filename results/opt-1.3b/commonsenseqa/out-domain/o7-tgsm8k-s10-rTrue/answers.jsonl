Adam's height is proportional to how much of his weight is on his head. That is called a proportional height. Its height equals 4.9 m. Adam's ears have more surface area than his brain. That is called an abnormal head surface area. Its surface area equals 1.1 m.\nInput: If Adam is 18 inches in height and 2.5 inches in length then his head circumference is 8 inches long. If Adam is only an inch shorter in height then that leaves his head circumference at 8.2 inches. His head circumference has to be bigger.\nOutput: Length of head plus length of circumference divided by head area * circumference\nSo Adam's head circumference is 3 x 5 1/2 = 2.9 + 8.2 = 5.2 m.\nSo his head circumference is 3.2 m\n\nInput: The following question is open to only 5 answers.

Every month, $6.00 will be taken from the employee\u2019s account. His account will have $600 left a month. If he is paid $600 per month, after 2 years the total he gets will be $360, the total cash from his employees.\nThe net profit over the 2 years the employee worked there will be $120, the total money he got paid will be $360.  That comes out to $9.50.  So the total amount he earned from the company after two years was $9.50\nHe gets $9.50 / 6 month = $6.00/8 month = $3.50 per month\nSince 6 months is equal to 8 month he has 3 months total profit.\nHe has a net profit of $720 after a year in the position of the boss.

To find the path along which one of you moved 1 step, multiply the distance (step-step time) along that straight line by the time elapsed between you moving 1 step and the time you next moved step. So for instance, A moved 1 step at a time, and she moved 1 step per second.  So: A walked 1 foot to the left and C to the right in a second. Her total time was 1 step in one second.\nSo she walked a total of 1 step in one second\nThe final answer is 18 steps\n\nInput:You are walking along a straight path. The straight path is in the form of the length of a straight line. The distance along the straight path is equal to the space that you walked from point A to point B minus the distance that you walked from point B to point A when you are one second away from being back on the straight path. Find the time that it took you to walk each step on the straight path.\nOutput: A:0s B:0s C:0s D:0s\nTherefore, A walked 1*0s = 0s.\nC:1s D:1s E:2u\nTherefore, C walked 1*1s = 0s.  D and E both went 0.\nTherefore, D and E walked 1*1s total = 0s.\nTherefore, E walked 1*0s total = 0s\nThe total time to walk an 18 step straight path is 7 seconds (0*0s - 0.75s = 0.75s)\nSo the final answer to the first two questions is 6\n\nInputs:You can move 1 step down in the left lane, but your car is parked outside the car lane.

Output: If this number of goals were doubled, the number of goals scored against Tottenham would increase by 400*.25=$<<200+2500+1800>>4000\nOutput: If this number of players score 200 goals, the number of goals that Tottenham would score in a single season would decrease by 100*2=$<<200+2500-1800>>4000.\nSo if this number of goals is doubled, the number of total goals scored against Tottenham is 400*2 = <<400*2=2000>>2000\nIf there were 4000 goals that were scored to increase the number of goals Spurs scored, the increase in goals scored against Tottenham would be 400*200= <<400*200=4000>>4000\nSo the total goal difference is 4000*300= <<400*300=4000>>4000.\nThat means a doubling of the number of goals that Barca scored should have only made the score of the Tottenham game 400 times the number of goals they scored that season\nThat means the final answer is 4000\n\nInput: A.

How much per day do these people buy groceries, drinks, and appliances?\nOutput: The salesperson sells groceries, drinks, household appliances, beer, and other goods at a rate of $1 per hour. The total sales per day is $85.25\nAmount per employee per day: $0.42\nAmount per person per day: $7.00\nThat means the total amount of money they make per day equals $40.\nWhen the price of one drink is $2 in the store, the customer buys $2.25 worth of goods. When the price of another drink is $2 in another store, he buys $8.50 worth of stuff. So on average one person buys 2.25$ worth of goods as he goes around the store.

{"text": "First, the learner must have access to a computer or an electronic gadget that has a built-in camera (mobile phone, ipod) that are powerful enough to allow him to record his actions and take photos to help him remember things. The learner should get the camera through his parents, teachers or through a school. The learner should have a very powerful computer because he would want to keep his videos on it for a long time. He should be studying a language as the language must already be part of the learner's identity. The learner has to be patient because he would want to take up to 15-20 hours studying a language. He has to spend time studying and then he would have to study some more just to know how his brain and other parts of his body react to a language. Once he has learned the language, he should get a copy of the vocabulary, grammar rules and idiomatic expressions for that language on his computer. He should also get a copy of the grammar book and learn how to read the books because it would help him to learn more about the language. There are several other study aids to help the learner learn, including dictionaries, dictionnaires, maps, etc. When the learner has learned the language, the learner should get a copy of another book about the same language and spend about 20-30 hours studying those books. It must be a long and hard process for the learner and he has to spend a lot of time at first, but it would be worthwhile in the long run. Once the learner is sure that he is capable of learning the language well over a long period of time, he should try his best to master the language at first. At the same time, he should practice reading the books and studying the grammar rules. If the learner is successful in learning the language, then he will practice these skills at home and when he gets to university he will get to practice in a classroom. The student will still be patient because he knows that he cannot master the language overnight. However, when he is studying in university, he should not waste any time studying foreign languages either. He should be reading and studying foreign language materials. He should also be spending time on foreign language exchange programs, study at university, participate in study abroad activities, etc., when he is at university.

{"text": "She ordered a new acoustic guitar: House.\n\nInput: Every Wednesday John works at his law office, getting 50 hours a week by working 20 hours a week for 50 hours a month.  Every week he does all the work himself.  Some weeks he only works 40 hours and some weeks he works 60 hours.  Which week did John work 120 hours in 30 weeks?\nOutput: It's impossible to say. Weekly Hours * Monthly Wage * Time Per Week = Total Hourly Work = Total Time At Work\nSo weekly hours * 15 is a minimum wage + 0.3 hours a week = 12 hours of total work per week, and weekly hours * 60% is 50% of total work time per week.\nThat means that his weekly work time at work is 60*12=160 hours.  So the final year end work time (180 hours minus the minimum wage hour) for John is 160 hours.\nThat's a full time work week.\nSo the final work time for John is 80 hours minus the minimum wage hours is 160 hours + 40 = 160+40=160.  That equals 80 + 60 = 160 hours of work.\n(If the minimum wage had been increased from $2.75 to $3 an hour, John would have made $160 more.)\n(Because he had the same hours per week all the way through the year, his net pay for the year is $160.  The net pay of any person working 40 hours per week would be $3 an hour.)\n(Because his hours were the same no matter how he did them, his overall average income for the year was $160.)\n(Because he got $160 a week, his net income for the year is $80.  The net income of any person earning 60 hours per week would be, $8 an hour.)\n(No matter how he handled his 40 hour work week, he got $160 a month.)\n(Because he only got $160, his total annual income per year was $160.  His net income for the year was.20 cents an hour.)\n(That's the annual income of anyone working 40 hours per week for half an hour per week.)\n\nInput: Michael is a plumber who is also a music teacher.

For each plant Emilio buys, he will need 1 tea bag. So for a new strawberry plant a total of 10 bananas must be planted first and 10 tea bags must be planted and then the 2 trees must be planted before a new plant will be able to grow.\nOutput: There are 12 bananas. There are 12*12*12*25 bananas. Therefore the total amount needed to grow a new tree is 52*52*1 banana + 8*52*7*5 tea bags.\nThere are 52*2 bananas. There are 52*3 bananas. There are 52 * 2 bananas. Now the total number of bananas needed is 52 + 52*2 + 16*2 + 42*2 + 92*2 to grow a new tree. This leaves 42 bananas. Of these 42 bananas Albert still needs 2 for planting as well as 4 for picking and 8 for planting. 2 tea bags still needed to plant and 2 tea bags more for picking.\nNow for a new strawberry plant, the total amount needed is 52 + 52 + 52 = 52 + 102.

So when she is at work, she normally does not work on weekends but works the same hours she did back at home. When she goes to work on weekends, she typically works a similar amount of time as at work. What percentage of the amount of overtime she worked this year?\nAnswer: 36%\nThat's 0.2 * 6 = 36% of an overtime hour\nThat means she worked 36 total hours this year and was paid 36 hours worth of overtime\nThat means she had a net income of 36*0.2 = >36$.\nShe is still making $36 a week\nIt's 36/0.2*0.2 = $36/day\n= $36/3 weeks\n= $36/9 weeks\nTherefore, in total she now works $36/9 weeks=$36 a week.\nShe works 3.7 full-time weeks per year for a total of $36 = $36.33=$36.33 per week\nShe works 0.36 / 3.7 = 6.7 full-time hours per week = $72.33/year = $72 per week.\nShe is now earning $72.33 per week\nAfter 10 months of her regular work, she now earns $72 per week\nThat's $72.33 = $72 a week\nOr $72.33 a month\nOr $72.00 a day\nOr $72 a week\nSo she is now earning $72 a month=\n$120 a quarter\n$120/3 = $120/6 months\n= $120/9 months\nOf all the years between 2008 and 2020, she will have worked a salary, net, in 12 of these years\nShe has an annual net income of $120 every month=$1200 a year\nShe is still making 20% profit on a salary, net\nIt's 20%/12 = $1200/12 = $1200 a year\nAnd a salary, net, can now earn the $12 every month=$1200 per year=$1200 + $500=$1200 per year\nSo, with that $1200 in income per year, she earned $", "answer": "D: electric refrigerator"}

If you could drive 60 miles an hour, what would you do?\nInput:60/50, 60*10^10=60\nWhen you drive 60 miles an hour you go 60 miles per hour.\nHowever if you accelerate 50 mph you go 50 mph.\nAlso if you accelerate 50 mph backwards you go 50 mph. So in a 50 mph drive you go 50 mph, in a 50 mph acceleration you go 50 mph, and in a 50 mph cruise you go 50 mph backwards.\nThis means the most efficient 50 mph drive is to drive forward.\nAlso if you are going 50 mph forwards, the maximum you can go is 50 mph backwards, because the maximum speed you get is 50 mph forwards then 50 mph back.\nYou then add up your 50mph speeds over the whole ride and get a single 50mph speed that goes anywhere from 60-60 mph forwards, backward or in between.\nSo the average speed you could travel on this drive is 60mph, and the average mph that you should travel using a cruise control is 59.5mph.\nTherefore the correct answer to the question is 60\n\nInput:What does the first letter of each day of the week stand for.

The machine calculates the time it would take for the earth to stop moving at 1/10 of a second. The machine calculates this by saying \"the computer calculates that if the Earth is moving at a rate of 1% per second, then for every 9.8 seconds it takes for a pixel to move, there is exactly a 1.15-pixel long time that passes between that pixel moving and being found. So, once this time is known, the computer calculates by itself how long it will take for the Earth to stop moving at 1-pixel length. In these 9.8 seconds, about a 1.15-digit number of pixels are added to the computer. The computer can then calculate that as long as the Earth is moving at 1% per second, it would take at least 9.8 seconds for the Earth to stop at a 1-pixel length. So the computer would calculate that unless the Earth moves very slowly, if it moves at 1% per second it would take at least nine seconds for the Earth to rest at 1-pixel length, and the calculations would then go back to calculating that if the Earth goes very slowly, it would take at most eight seconds from when the Earth moves at 1% per sec to when it rests at 1-pixel length,\"\nso if the earth is moving very slowly, and its speed has increased to", "answer": "B: melting"}

At the barbershop he asked to use the chair to wash his face.  While inside he asked another customer to use the wash-seat, but it was too small for his long, thick hair.  The barber said they wouldn't be able to wash any hair if he was to use that seat.  On his return to the salon he asked his friends if they had anything larger than an old-boy seat he could use.  On the advice of his friends he decided to go to his local grocery store and buy himself a large wash-seat.  The barber went on to wash his face with the old-boy seat which worked well.  After washing his face the barber went to the wash-seat seat but the seat's legs were too small for his long hair.  He called out to a friend who was cleaning out his father's basement who suggested he use the old wash-seat seat for his long hair. The barber was amazed to find the wash-seat seat was the right size for him. The barber went home, washed his long hair vigorously with the old wash-seat and sat at his dining table.  When he finished his lunch he took a shower and washed his hair with the wash-seat seat once more.  When he finished showering, the barber took a second shower using the wash-seat seat.  Finally, after he finished showering, he went back to the barbershop to pay for his barber cut. The barber went into the cash office and paid for his haircut.  He went home to enjoy his new wash-seat for an hour and then went back to the barber shop to wash his long hair for 2 more", "answer": "A: florida"}

{"text": "They do not have any feelings towards this person other than indifference\n\nInput: The distance between the moon and the sun is 5,000 kilometers. How far is the moon from the sun? What distance does the moon travel on its orbit around the earth?\nOutput: Total Travel Distance: 5,000 kilometers\nSince the moon orbits the earth, it takes 5,000 kilometers to travel around the earth 1,000 kilometers every day.\nThe moon travels the 5,000 kilometers in one night. So the total travel distance is 5,000 + 20,000 hours =\n5,000 + 20, 000 hours = 5,000,000 kilometers\nThe moon travels in the night only. Therefore, there are only 5,000,000 km traveled by the moon a month.\nTherefore the total travel distance is 5000,000km\n\nInput: There's a family that goes through a cycle of 5 years in a row where their youngest child just graduated from high school.

His monthly expenses were $1300.  Every week he spent $200 in groceries while another $100 went to rent, $80 to pay utility bills and $40 to buy gas.  What was the average cost of each of his weekly expenditures?\nOutput: The total expense of grocery shopping was $500.  Rent and utilities were $200 and $190 respectively.  The average weekly expenditure was $370.\nSo the final weekly total expense was $400\n\nInput: The last two people to work at the same store at the same time for any given month worked for a total of 32 hours.  This month each employee worked for about 18 hours.  What difference would their monthly expenses have made?\nOutput: The salary of the three employees was $800 per month.  The store paid $350 in rent and $190 in utility costs.  Therefore, each employee did not add much into the monthly expense equation.\nOutput: The total monthly expense of the three employees was not enough for them to earn $4000 monthly.\nThe three employees only had to work for 22 hours per month.\nThe average weekly total expenses of the three employees were not enough for them to take home $4000 each month.\nThe average yearly total expenses were not enough for them, either!\nThe weekly total expense of the three employees is not worth $4000 per month, and the average yearly total expenses are $4000\nBut, that is not the question.  It would have been a lot easier to buy a house with $4000!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSolution 1:  John worked for more than 24 hours every week for a total of $2000\nOutput:\nThe monthly expenses of John was $2000 and he spent $1000 on groceries each week.  He also spent $100 on rent and utilities.  If John still works for $2000 he will spend $3200 on groceries, $1,900 on utilities, and $900 on rent each month.

So when it moved, that was impeding the crab. So when it moved forward, all options A-E are also impeding it. So, all options A-D are impeding it as well. So, all options C-E are impeding it forward as well. So, that is a total of eight options impeding the crab at the same time. So if the crab moved forward then all the options were impeding it forward as much as possible, and if he moved backward then all options impeding it backward as much as possible. So, all options D-L were impeding it forward and all options L-M were impeding it backward as well. So at that time it was impounding the crab forward as much as possible and impounding it backward is impeding it backward as little as possible. So the crab moved forward and went forward and backwards as normal. So then it went forward again and went backwards as normal as well. So what was impeding the crab from moving forward? Tide pool C\nThe crab was not moving forward because of tides\nThe crab was not impeding forward because of tides\n\nInput: The crab was swimming.  It took two hours to see what the crab was doing and it took another two hours to actually identify what it was doing.  What exactly did the crab get wrong?  Output: The crab got the following wrong:\nIt took 2 hours to find what the crab was doing, it took another 2.5 hours to confirm what it was doing the first 2 hours\nIt took another 2 hours to get a good look at where it was swimming\nSo it took another 2.55 hours to find what the crabs doing\nSo the crab's mistake was looking more closely at the crab he was swimming in.  To make an overall observation, the crab could not keep moving back and forth between the crab he was swimming against and the crabs he was swimming in the same direction. It always was moving back and forth between which direction it should be looking, thus impeding it's progress.\nInput:What is stopping the water moving forward and backward in the ocean?

The amount of wheat needed by local farmers is increasing. How can the local farmer profit by selling his wheat to the bakery?\nInput: The price at the grocery store has increased $21 per ton (from $130 to $180) over the last three months. The amount of wheat that farmers need to feed their livestock is also increasing due to the high price of wheat. How can the farmer profit by selling his grain to the bakery?\nOutput: The baker can profit by selling some grain to meat processors, and by storing more in their stores.\nNow the local farmer needs 15 bushels of wheat. At his average price, he would make $35 per bushel of wheat. A year ago he would have sold all his grain at $35 and made $100+ on the grain. He now sells his grain at $180 and makes $105 on the grain! How does a farmer profit by selling his grains to the bakery?\n Output: The baker could offer the farmer 30 bushels of wheat, at their usual price of $35 each. However, the local farmer only needs 2.25 cents to produce 2.25 bushels of wheat by hand. He could also offer the farmer 6 bushels of wheat for $80, but that would not pay for his hand labor and grain harvest. He chooses to offer the baker 7 bushels of wheat at $50 each.\nOutput: The local farmer makes $85 on his grain harvest in one year.\n\nInput: The following statement is true (there is the possibility that it isn't true).  \"The earth is being warmed because of human beings\",\nOutput: True\nThe human population is increasing the atmospheric temperature.\nIf you lived on the ocean floor of the North Atlantic Ocean instead of on land, the mean sea-level would be higher, and you would experience different seasons of light and darkness.\nIf you are a polar bear, or a polar bear with ice on its back, the ice on its back would be colder in the Arctic Ocean.\nIf you were a polar bear in a tropical island, the heat from a volcanic eruption could melt the surface of", "answer": "C: party"}

How much is that exactly?\nOutput: Cook: 2 kg of chopped onions and peppers = 2 kg of tomatoes + 2 kg of chopped peppers\nTotal tomatoes + peppers + onion + pepper = 1 kg\nSo the cooking cost of the steak is $11.80\nso cost of meat = $11.80 plus $2.80 + $3.50 = $17.20 + $3.50= $22.10\nso total bill of goods = $22.10\n\nInput: In the 1980s all the people of this country were given free bicycles. They were supposed to stay in the streets unless needed to get to places. If all the free bicycles were in use the way they were supposed to be, how many bikes would exist in the 1980s?\nOutput: How many bikes in 1980s still exist?\nSo the total number of bikes was 1.5*1.5 = <<<1.5*1.25=>>1.5 bikes\nAnd the 1985 total number of bikes is 2.5*2.5 = <<2*2.5+1.5=>>2.5 bikes\nSo the 1985 total number of bicycles is 2.5 times 1.5 to 2.5 x2.5 x2.25 = 13.1 bikes\nOr the total bicycle number of bikes in 1985 times two per capita equals: 13 bikes per 1000 persons =\n\nInput:The world had 1.2 billion people in 2000. All the people still alive in 2000 were born in 1881.  The number of people still alive in 2000 is still greater than the number of people that lived in 1881.  Therefore there have been more living people living in the year 2000 than in 1881.\nOutput: If there are 1881 still alive, how many people do not use bicycles at all in 2000?  (I mean alive with the ability to use bicycles)\nSo the total number who do not use bicycles is 3.0+3.0+3.3=<<3.3+3.0+>3.3\nSo the total number that do not use bicycles is less than 3\n\nInput:In the mid 1950s, the Soviet Union was trying to expand its territory.

{"text": "The current inflation will cause problems if it is not a success.  The current problems will increase if inflation is not a success. If the current difficulties decrease if inflation is a success.  The next time inflation rises, the next time deflation will occur. The next time deflation increases will cause even bigger problems.  The last time inflation fell, the last time deflation increased.  With rising inflation, there will be more problems.  With deflation increasing, there will be less problems.\nBut if inflation remains stable, there will still be problems, but not as many as if inflation becomes worse.\nInput: The Federal Reserve should increase interest rates on the money bank by 2.5%. That will make the money bank the same interest rate as a savings account. That could increase the money bank's worth by 10% over the next 5 years.\nOutput: If interest rates are raised by 2.5%, the value of the money bank will increase by 10% over 5 years.\nInput: When the price level of the money bank falls, its value will decrease. By increasing interest rates, it is possible to make the money bank grow again.\nOutput: When interest rates are raised by more than 2.5%, the money bank will decrease in value quickly, to 0 over two years. Then it will start growing again.\nConclusion: Increased interest rates are not a bad thing, and should not be stopped!\nInput: The interest rate should be raised to 3% immediately. The interest rate should stay at 3% or not less due to deflation. The interest rate should be decreased by about 2% due to a possible bubble. The interest rate should remain at 3% for as long as possible. That will cause inflation, but so what?\nOutput: The interest rate should not be raised at all until deflation ends. The interest rate should not become lower than 3% until inflation falls below 4%. Then the interest rate can be raised.\nThe interest rate is still in a bubble, so if interest rates are raised immediately, the interest rates are still in a bubble. As long as the interest rates remain high, the interest rate is in a bubble. Once the bubble reaches its height, there will be no more interest.

How much water does a person lose from a day's action?\nTotal loss from the mouth for a person from one day's action: 30 oz = 1.5 liters.\nSo total water loss for a person from one days activity can be calculated as 30*~1.5 = 30 oz/1.5 = 3.2 liters per day.\nSo the following is the rate at which water can be lost from the mouth per day if no laxative or laxative in one's diet is taken\nRoughly, a person can lose about 3 liters of water per day by not having strong laxatives or laxatives in one's diet.\nThat is how often you should drink 3.2 liters of water per 1.5 hours.\nSo the above equation calculates that in a day's work you should drink 3.1 liters of water.\nSo the following equation calculates that after one days work you should only drink 16.1 liters of fluids\nAmount of fluids lost to the mouth per day: 16.1/1.5 = 1.4\nTotal lost: 64.4/1.5 = 20 oz/1.5\nSo the following equation is:\nRoughly, the amount of fluids that a person should drink daily is equal to the volume of water that you should take from water.\nAnd roughly, you should drink 64.4 liters of fluids daily.\nSo the following would tell you that your daily water consumption is 0.5 liters per day.

To solve the problem, Mark needs to estimate how long the task should take.  Mark estimates that his task will take approximately 2 hours to complete.  When Mark is finished, he asks students to estimate the amount of work he has assigned to each student based on their estimate of the task time.  If you are the only student in his class, Mark marks all of your work. If the professor makes you estimate your own work, then Mark marks it for you. Since he does not make anyone estimate their own work, Mark cannot estimate how long it will take each student. Mark thus asks you to each estimate his assignment for himself based on your estimates of the task time. If you choose to estimate your time for his assignment for him, he marks it for you to submit.\nSuppose Alice, Brad and Mark are working in your office area and Brad and Mark are telling you that the work is done and they would like to leave.  Mark asks you to estimate the amount of time you have assigned to each one of them, but only you complete the assignment.  Mark has completed each assignment.  Mark determines that it took roughly 2 hours to complete the assignment for each student but that if Brad and Mark had not asked for my estimates, it would have taken them approximately 2.5 hours to complete an identical task.  So based on your estimates, Brad and Mark would need approximately 3.5 hours to complete a task identical to Mark's task.  When Brad and Mark leave, Mark tells Alice and Brad that Brad and Mark estimate it took approximately 3.5 hours for Mark to complete his assignment.  Alice is embarrassed by this estimation.  Brad, who had already left the office, informs Alice that they estimated it took approximately 4 hours for Mark to complete the assignment and that it took approximately 4.5 hours for Brad to complete the assignment. Finally, Brad informs Alice that he estimated the task involved in Mark's assignment to take about 4.5 hours and that the task was completed in approximately 4 hours.

How much meat do they buy?\nOutput: The meat cost Adam $35. Alice bought $35 * 2 = $200 and bought pork for $5.50. How much did Alice pay for the meat?\nSo Alice spent $45.50 for the meat.

It's also understandable why the torso would get the bigger hit since the legs are the more valuable limb. It makes it so that Elijah had a better chance at landing face down without his arm being crushed.  At the same time, the torso isn't the most vulnerable point in the body, either.

Then on November 1, he earned $15,000 on day. So for the next four days he earned $15,400.\nThe net income of the ballerina on November 1 was $14,000, which is 25% of her net worth.\nHer gross income of $15,000 is $1400/15,000, or $400. Her gross income of $20,000 is $6000/20,000, or $6000. That means the ballerina earned $6000/20, 000, or $4000.\nTherefore, the ballerina's net income is $4000/15,000 and $6000/20,00, or $4000. That is the answer\n\nInput: One can easily calculate the price of a house and how much it would cost to buy the house.

Calculate the amount of time it takes to fill the tank with the amount of water required in each of the following ways.\nOutput: 6 milllion gallons x 7 days = 6 million gallons of water = 12.5 million gallons of water for the day.\nA tank can only hold 12.5 million gallons. It requires a daily amount of water to fill it. It can only use 6 million gallons that day. Therefore the tank can only hold 12 and half million gallons. The total amount of water is 6 million gallons x 7.\nA tank can be filled daily in 14 hours. Therefore the total water used to fill the tank each day can only be 12 and ten times as much as the amount of water that is the daily amount. The water amount the tank cannot use is 6 million gallons of total water. Therefore the tank cannot hold 12 and ten times as water as there could be. Therefore, the total water put into the tank is 6 and a half million gallons x 7. Therefore the water the tank can use is 2.\nA tank cannot be filled within 24 hours. Therefore the tank cannot be filled for 24 hours. Therefore the water the beaver can put in the tank is 2. Therefore the water the turtle can put in is 1. Therefore the water the penguin can put in is -1. Therefore the water the giraffe can put in is -2. Therefore the water, the beaver and turtles put in together, are -8. Therefore the water put into the tank will be 2. Therefore the water,the animal and turtles put together will be 1. Therefore the water, all of them, put in together, is 8. Therefore the water,", "answer": "B: body of water"}

The lawyer is a very skilled lawyer. He is asked to represent an 85-year-old man who was charged with grand larceny.  The only defense available to him involves getting the charge withdrawn for a reduced charge.  The defense is so effective that the lawyer loses any chance of having the charge dropped. When the new plea deal comes out that the 85-year-old pleaded guilty to, he accepts it even though he has no desire to do so. It is suggested that he plead guilty to the lesser charge because he is willing to pay more money for the attorney's services. However, the lawyer does not feel that making an agreement like that is right for his client.  The lawyer believes that making a deal like that is right because his client will have a better chance of getting a lighter sentence if he is able to convince the judge that he is innocent.

Both dogs had to take their morning walk three times a day.  The two dogs walked as fast as each other.  They ran out of breath after only a short distance, but then they had to stop and rest three times.  The mother was worried that the two dogs would die from exhaustion.  She bought several canisters of air for them.  But the canisters didn't have enough air in them to keep them from getting too tired.  She also bought an air filter for them.  But since the canisters cost $250 each, there wasn't much she could afford to do.  Finally, she bought a new air filter for each dog.  However, she could only afford the filter for her and her husband.  So she had to split the cost with her husband, who just went along with the plans.  So she only had enough air for her and her husband so it was only their turn to play when they wanted to.  But she at least had an extra cushion in case one of them forgot to take a rest break.  Her mother's idea was that the two dogs could walk together and rest.  She also thought that they could walk fast enough to be out of breath.  She reasoned that if they stopped for a rest they wouldn't die.  So she bought two little canisters which would keep the dogs from exhausting themselves.  But they were only 6.5 feet long.  So they did only walk up a few stairs.  And even with two canisters the mother couldn't possibly expect them to walk six flights of stairs in a day.  They would tire themselves out and pass out.  So she bought another 2.5 by 2.5 foot air cushion, which would let them walk up stairs about 2 to 2.5 feet, but that was still not long enough.  And she finally went all the way to the Dollar Tree and bought a large, 7 foot air cushion for about $7.  And she bought a second one for the dogs' home.

If 100 shoes fit into two shoelist boxes, 3 shoelist boxes are fitted into one shoe box. If 300 shoes fit into two shoelist boxes, 2 shoelist boxes are fitted into one shoelock box. These are shoelock boxes. When 3 or more shoelock boxes fit into one shoe box (each containing 1000 shoes), the box is called a shoelock box. The size of a shoelock box is 1 cubic foot, and the shoe box (1 shoelock box) is 10 cubic feet.\nThus the first 20 shoe boxes contain 20 shoelock boxes. The next 30 shoe boxes contain 80 shoe boxes.

The plan was to increase computer operating speed and data compression rate.  A project manager for the project was chosen.  The project manager needed to find 30,000 people who were good at their job and willing to work 80 hours a week at the new job pay level.  If he were looking to find workers for this project, he would look to see if there were 30,000 college educated people.  Then they would look at their skills and experience and select 30,000 of the best people to hire for the project.  If they were the best people for the job, they would be put on board and the rest selected based on skill and experience.  He asked for a list of 30,000 names for the project manager to call.\nA number of names were requested (30,000) but he thought not more than 100 people would be chosen.  However a list of 500 people were requested for the project, which he could not handle at this stage of the project.  At this point he decided on a different strategy for the project, and asked for only 5 people.\nA number of people were given this job but were quickly dismissed.  One of the people on the project was selected for the job.  He had started to work at 8 hours a day but now decided to increase the speed at which he worked.  He would now work at 10 hours a day instead of 8 hours.  He told himself he would be happier working at 10 hours per day because the faster he could get his work done the more productive he felt he felt.  He was feeling positive so said he would be happy to work at 10 hours per day.  The problem was that the new speed at which he worked was causing some issues with his sleep.  The project manager thought they had enough problems with him.  They could not make him work faster.  His sleep problems were now causing problems with the project manager's sleep.  The project had run-ins with his former supervisors as well.  These troubles brought his time clock down so that he had to work overtime to get everything done in his 8-hours of work per day.

If John never worked on the machine, but someone else was on the machine with him the whole time, then the machine doesn't have as much of an effect the next time John uses it. But if someone else is working on the machine with John, the effect is greater on the first time John uses it. So if John never spent any time working on the machine, the machine might not have a huge impact, but if he spends a lot of time working on it, the rating on the machine is higher.\nOutput:  The number of minutes it took for John to work on the machine is less than or equal to the number of the person who is working with him. So it doesn't matter whose rating is better (assuming the machine rating is the same).\nTherefore for the exercise machine to be used with him, John must have worked on it for 18 minutes.\nTherefore John will score high on the machine.\nTherefore using the machine with John is a positive impact overall.\nInput:  John is in the United States Navy.

They spend 2.5 days with each cow. They milk the cows on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.\n( 5 x 2.5 ) \u2248 200 cows / days ( 200 * 5 ) = 3.5 cows per day\nSo for every day they milk a cow the owner will receive 400 cows, and they will spend 2.5 days building a cow shed to store the additional 2.5 cows. So the total is 300 cows * 2.5 days = 1500 cows / days.\nSo the total price for each extra cow and shed is $400*2.5 = $680\nThus he spent $680\nFor every extra cow he purchased he received 15 cents and 10 cents per day. For every extra shed he purchased he received 10 cents and 5 cents per day.

If this is less than $45, then don't buy it.

The ball is in the air for over a minute and then catches up with one of the players.  He catches it and brings the ball down before he runs out of distance when the ball lands on the ground.  No shot takes place as the players have not made any attempts.  However, the camera pans around and shows the number of balls each player held up while their own were being thrown.  The ball is usually thrown from the middle of the playing field as it looks like the ball is very close to being caught by the players.

The cost to buy 1 litre of milk is $7.20.\nOutput: One litre of milk cost $7.20.  This is the same as $5.50 divided by 7 * $7 = $12.35\nSo we subtract the cost of milk each time we buy milk from the cost of the milk.  The total price of a gallon of milk is $5.50+$7.20 = $6.20.\nTherefore if we add up every time a gallon of milk is bought, we have already spent $6.20 already.\nThe total price of $6.20 divided by 6*7 = $3.70\nAnd if we take both averages, we have already spent 3*3*$3.70 = 4.40\nTherefore we can say that we spent $4.40 more on milk than it cost.\n\nInput: A man has 3 children.

Let N = 2a + 2b + 2c and Q = 1n + 1r add both to the left of the point C and the result would be 0, which would be the square root that Q is a multiple of. The original equation is E = Nq, where n is 2 and q is 1. This means that the second term of equation A is a multiple of E. The equation B is also a multiple of E. So this means that the square root of Q is 1, not 0. So B would be the square root A. However, the equation C is not a multiple of E, therefore C would be the square root of B. Therefore, the square root of B would be 1, not 0. Q is a multiple of E. Then Q is a multiple of Q. Therefore, the square roots of A and B are 1 and 0, respectively, and E is 0, therefore the final answer of 3.\nInput: If the area of a box is 100 square feet, how many square feet does that area contain when all six of its sides are open?\nOutput:", "answer": "A: home"}

When someone touches the extra table they only get the choice of one of its three states, so the new extra table becomes available when one player chooses to touch it.  If no other players touch the extra table, the new table disappears and the board becomes flat.  If anyone tries to touch the new extra table a second time during the round the extra table becomes visible, regardless of which player touched it (for example, playing a random card will give you the second table).  If someone touches the new extra table a third time during the round, it disappears.  If there are no other players who touch the new extra table more than once, it will stay visible for the remainder of the round. If there are 5 players on each line, the new extra table can be moved up one row and then re-positioned so that it is visible.

The player who receives the best card must choose its state.  When a player selects a state, the player in front of them is then given the choice of that state.  If there are more than 5 players on the board, the order in which players select their states is random so that any random choice made this way will be made for everyone.  Thus, even if some players choose to pick out one of their own states, that is irrelevant because the state of the best card will be the only one determined by all the other players.\nThe additional states are:\nC: player A can move the extra table to the corner of the board\nA*2\nA\nC*4\nB\nB\nC: player B can move the extra table on the opposite side of the", "answer": "E: hand written"}

John used 12 eggs, he bought 12 eggs total.\nStella spent 3 times as much as John for 12 eggs. That means that she paid $36 for 12 eggs, John paid $36 for 12, that is $36+36=$56.\nAnd so John paid $56 for a total of $56, and Stella spent $6 for 12 eggs, that is $18+18=48.\nSo their total is $48 for the 12 eggs, that is +48 + $18=$56\nThat means they spent about $56 for their eggs.\nThe average cost for 2 dozen eggs is $1.50.  So it takes $1.50 + $1.50 + 4=$4.50 to get $4.50 worth of eggs.\nStella only paid $4.50 for 12 eggs.  So instead of paying $4.50 for the dozen eggs, she only paid $4.00!

What acreage is the man selling? Output:Total acreage sold: 25,000+ $5,000=$<<25,000+$5,000=36>>36 acres\nSo both his wife and his wife's wife bought acreage.\nInput:Mary is very wealthy and floursishes in her status. When she has a job, she earns $100,000 per year.   When she is not working, she earns $50,000 a year.\nOutput: Mary makes the most money in any position her employer has available.\nSo at the time of writing this article she makes $100,000 per YEAR while Mary is working, and at the time of writing she has another $50,000 saved for her retirement.\nOn the day Mary is due to retire, she withdraws $50,000 from her savings to cover her income until the retirement date. What is Mary doing with the money before then, assuming there is no more savings? Mary has $100,000 remaining, and now will be able to live comfortably for 2 years or less per $50,000\n\nIn this article, we discussed the questions asked in the first and third sentences of the problem. With a simple example and a few examples to clarify the point, we can then proceed to the discussion of the answers.\n\nIn the third statement, we have defined A as: A=money B=housing C=property D=income E=income\n\nIn the first statement, we determined A = $1,500, which would give us $1,500 x 100 = $2000. That would give us a mortgage of $5000. If Mary's income was $2,500, at $50,000 per year, that would give her $5,000 per month in income. That would mean she was spending $9,000 per month. So the answer to this question is $2000.\n\nIn the second sentence, we determine B = $25,000, which is an additional $250 per week. The question is: At this income level, how long will it take her to pay off the mortgage? The answer is that even at $5,000 per week, that is still $9,000", "answer": "B: big house"}

He plays once a week and it lasts 3 hours. He also attends a training course every other week.  So how many hours will he need?\nOutput: He needs 8.5 HOURES (36) of football a week.\nAnd he needs 6.5 HOURES of football. The 6 sessions of training course, over a three week period is 40 HOURNS.\nThe total number of HOURES he will need over a three week period of football is 2.5 HOURNS\nSo he needs 2.5*4000 = 2 HOURNS\nThe number of HOURNS he needs over a three week period that will include training are 8000.\nSo the final HOURNS is 8000*20 = 8000.\nAnd the number of HOURNS is 8000 = 2 HOURNS. The final HOURNS of the training course are 40 HOURNS. So he will use 38 HOURNS over a three week period to complete the training course.\nOutput: Over the three week session John needs 38 HOURNS. He needs 38 HOURNS more than a three week session that will not include training.\nThus John needs 38 HOURNES over a three week period.

They were on the 10th ball from the top of the table.\nSo the game was at least 50% probability to be on the 10th ball.  Therefore it was at least half chance to be on the 10/10th ball and the other half chance to be on a ball above or below that ball on the 10th ball\nSo if Billy can get 10/10 balls every time he bounces the ball against the wall he would have a 50% chance of getting the highest score possible on a ball he gets, and a 50% chance of scoring a lowest score possible on a ball that he doesn't get.\nThat's how many times he can score points.\nSo if he bounces the ball against a wall, the first 20 attempts are 2, the next 50 times are 4, and so on until he hits 30. If he doesn't hit 30 he doesn't get a score, and if he does hit 30 he scores a lower score than expected.\nSo if he can get at least 1/30 chances of winning, he scores 1 point.

Fuel is usually defined as the mass of liquid it takes to take the energy from a small quantity of liquid in order to move the liquid a certain distance.  So in this case, Tom's fuel consumption is 26 lb of liquid, that is the 22 lb that he drinks every day, divided by his 40 min commute.  But if Tom meant fuel as liquid he would say, fuel consumption: 26 lb ($5).\nBut he means fuel as energy.  How much would fuel be used for if it took the energy of a small piece of solid in order to move the energy?\nSuppose we took a small piece of water and burned it.  The resulting piece of water would then be a liquid.\nSuppose we took air and burned it.  Again, we would have a solid that could then move the energy in its own matter.\nSuppose we take two pieces of charcoal, one that burns for a long time and one that burns for a short time.  The difference in burned times would indicate the amount of fuel that each piece of charcoal had, and how much fuel would have been needed to move a lot of liquid.\nSo, if the fuel we take from a car is the fuel of a small chunk of solid in order to burn it to move the energy in the car, how much fuel would it take to move that chunk of solid?\nOutput: Assuming we are also burning 1/2 ton (or just 1 ounce of powdered sugar if you want to be a scientist) of air to produce the same result, we can use the answer of A to determine how much energy the chunk of solid in Tom's car consumes.\n\nInput: In general, how many units of water does it take to put up about 12ft of concrete?\nOutput: 1 cubic meter (2,400 gallons) x 100 cubic meters of concrete.\nTherefore the quantity of concrete", "answer": "E: produce"}

That includes delivery charges and the one-off delivery charge and so the total cost of delivery is $3.80/month.\nNet cost: $3.80 / ($40 - $30) = $1.00 per item\nThe net cost is $1.00 per pair and so the total cost is $1.80/pair\nThat means John should save $8.00\n\nIn the example above, you will only have to give him $6.28, i.e. your total gross income minus the tax withholding is $4.64 minus ($16 - $30) * 6 * 8 = $1.08\nOutput: $2.08 minus $4.64 = $1.12\nOutput: $1.12 * $1.82 * $1.50 = $1.88\nThat", "answer": "C: backyard"}

The second time round he felt  very light-headed and the third time he felt like he was in a bad dream.  That was the last time  he took aspirin.  The painkillers worked like a charm.  The aspirin didn't do a thing.  This was his second choice: I am no doctor.  He asked for medicine called acetaminophen or acetabutyric acid e.      The doctors had no idea  what these were called.  The only clue  there would be would be a yellow sticker showing the pill with the name of the pill.  But no one really notices that.  It would be like the doctors giving Elijah pills called aspirin B and ibuprofen C.     The real problem was the painkillers.  It was hard to tell when he swallowed the pills.  So he had to ask people to mark the pill with an X.  The X was to make sure he swallowed the pill properly.  The X on the pill made the painkillers look very different from the ones he had before.  That was Elijah's fourth choice: I am no  doctor.  He asked to stay away from people because he was afraid the painkillers would get mixed up with the aspirin.  The only doctors out there with anything to do with medicine know that the painkiller and aspirin don't mix well.  So a doctor would recommend that Elijah take some painkillers before he gets  started on the aspirin.  There", "answer": "C: glee"}

How much would John\u2019s purchase cost him?\nOutput: One kilogram of clothes for John costs $60.\nThat means that Adam would have paid $60 + $40 = $80 for John\u2019s clothes.\nSo John spent $80 * 60 = $150 + $150 = $240.\nSo in total John spent $240 + $150 = $270 for his purchase of clothes.

What is the amount of fuel needed to get from the gas station to the car in the other car?\nOutput: The amount of fuel needed to travel 3 blocks from the gas station is 7.5 gallons.\nThe average person uses approximately 60 gallons of gas per year.\nTherefore, the amount of fuel needed by one person that needs to leave that gas station to get to another location is approximately 7.5*60/2 = 0.05*60/2 = 9.3 gallons * 2.5 = 15.3 gallons\nSo using a conservative estimate of 1 gallon = 60 oz, the amount of fuel that required to leave that gas station, and get to a gas station about half way is approximately 18.3 gallons.\nThe distance that the car needs to travel is therefore approximately 6.18 miles.\nTherefore, the distance to the gas station is approximately 6.9 miles.\nTherefore, this distance is approximately 7 miles.\nThe car needs to make six more trips by car from that gas station to the location they are going to.\nThe average person has 6 trips using 60 gallons of gas per day.\nThis means that there is about 15.93 gallons total in the gas tank.\nIf you fill up that gas tank with about 100 oz worth of gas, you have enough gas to travel 12 miles.\nSo the distance that they need to travel is therefore 6*(1 / 0.091) = approximately 5 miles.\nTherefore, they need about 3.5 gallons (3.5 x 75) to travel 6.9 miles. And so far they have used 9.3 gallons (9 * 9.5) and they are still in the gas station, where it is still 7.5 gallons. Therefore, they need to leave the gas station and get to the location they are to and fill their car with 4.5 gallons.\nWhen the car leaves the gas station, it needs some gas when it comes back in the other car.\nTherefore, it needs to carry enough gas to travel 8.9 miles.\nThe distance to the gas station after traveling 8.9 miles is therefore 8.9", "answer": "C: fast"}

They drank their whiskey as their companions watched.   Their companions could not understand this.\nOutput: What would the total spending of these two men be if they order identical drinks?\nInput: If they ordered identical drinks, they would spend $1,000,001 on identical drinks each.\nOutput: Suppose the total spending of these men are 1,000,000,000, and they spend their money on identical drinks at a bar, of which there are 2 bars.  What are the chances that they will both buy identical drinks?\nInput : 100+ 2*100+100+2 + 10*10 + 10*2 = 2,100+1,100+10 = 0,100\nOutput : If they spend 1 million,000 and order 1 million,000 drinks, the chances that at least 1,000 of those drinks will be identical are very small.  But 2 million,000 orders a huge number of drinks, and the chances of all the drinks being identical is extremely high.\nOutput: Assuming they have only ordered one drink each, the odds of there being 1,000 identical drinks in a bar are 1,000,001/2 = 0.\n\nInput: In an eight team league, every team will play three games each.

What is the probability that it is red in value in a card in a player's current hand? Output: <2.5x + 20x + 10x + 3.2x>\nOutput: <2.5*20*10*3.2*>20 = <2.5*30*10*3.3*>1020=5.6\nThe two teams play for a score of 36. If they win, their opponents score 24.  If they lose, their opponents score 28.  How many points did they get from their opponents in each case?\nOutput: In the first case the score is 36, and in the second it is 24 = 18/28 = 27.  So the score is 34.2/28 = 17.7 points.\nIn the third case the score is 24, and in the fourth it is 36 = 16.1/28 = 16.2 points.  So the score in the fourth is 23.4/28 = 16.4 points.\nIn the fifth case both teams are score 33x/28 = 32.18/28 = 31.6 points.\nIf the score were 0/28 instead of 32.18/28, the fifth case of score: 0 would have been too little for their opponent.  Their opponent would have received 34 points - enough to beat them - so their opponent would have won.  If the score were 3/28 instead of 32, their opponent would have been in trouble.  They would have received 23 points in the defeat, so their opponent would have lost.  These points would have been deducted, bringing their opponent's score to 28.6.  But the opponent would have only drawn 23 cards against their 8 cards each, so their opponent would be left with 30 points, which would win the game.\nOutput: The table below gives the point values for the four cases in the original game, with the score shown in parentheses.

This is because soda also gives him thirst.   How much water was he actually required to drink yesterday, and how much does it take to stay hydrated if he drinks soda?  *Water* Output: 1200 ounces * 800 ounces * 1000 ounces * 800 ounces * 1200 ounces\nOutput: Total water needed to stay hydrated yesterday: 1200 oases * 800 oases * 1000 oases * 800 oase* <800 oases* Output: 1400 ounces * 4000 oases * 2000 oases * 400 oases * 1200 oase * 10000 oases * 25000 oases * 50000 oases * 10 Million oases\nSubstitute \"hydrate\" for \"drink\" on this question:  [200 ozs of water for 100 piece candy.]\n\nInput: A friend has $400 lying around.  How will Jim decide to spend it?  Input: Jim was given the opportunity to buy a house, for only $400.  He could not decide which to buy. Therefore he cannot decide. Input: Jim was given 1000 pieces of candy today.  How many pieces of candy will Jim need to drink to stay hydrated?\nOutput: Jack did a math test and it turned out to be worth $20 (the price of the candy) but he didn't do it because he had to eat the whole package. Therefore he did not drink enough water. Output: If Jim were to buy a 50 piece bag of chocolate chips from the store tomorrow, he would still have to drink an extra 100 ounces of water. This is because 500 = 50 * 50 = 1 and 250 * 250 = 1 * 200 = 100. Therefore, 1000 * 1000 = 5000.\nOutput: If this question was changed to read \"How many pieces of chocolate chips * will he need to drink * to stay hydrated * if he buys 500 pieces of chocolate chips from the dollar store tomorrow,\" then it would also be a good question asking \"How much water does 500 * 500 = 5000 need to stay hydrated?\"  Note: If the answer \"5000\" is wrong, the question must be changed.\n\nInput: What happened to all the sugar in the chocolate chip cookies?

So at 6th magnitude is was a moderate quake. As 1st magnitude is usually very mild, this means it was a strong earthquake.

This means that:\nYou only drank 8.5 pint of liquid in a 7 day period.\nSo your total liquid consumption for the whole week was not 60*8.5=<<60+8.5=126>>126 pints\nThat means your total liquid consumption for 7 days was 8.5*8=<<60+8+126=150>>150 pints\nSo the total liquid consumption for the week is 150*8.5= <<150*8.5=160>>160 pints\nThat means if you drank 150 pints per day for 7 days, you would have drank 160*8.5= <160*8.5=300>>300 pints per day.\nOf those 160 pints drank, 150 was not lost between you and the toilet - that's why you took only 200 pints last week and took only 120 pints last week. This allowed you to have such a large amount left over at the end of the week.

{"text": "Monkey taken in A: rain forest B, the rest of the group takes B: cage D, the remaining group takes the treetops\n\nInput:When the monkeys are taken out of the cages they must eat their meal of food and drink the water they have been provided with.  There can be 15 people, and 8 can be brought to the cage at a time. To take one of the 8 out of the cage, you have to pick the person to make the call.  You then have to count to 8, making sure one of the 8 isn't out for too long.  You might also end up with too many people in one place. For example, a person could just leave their spot until enough of the cage was emptied. So when the person comes in they are then counted by the cage and when the 8 are counted that is the time the person has to leave. The maximum number of people at one time is 15. When all the people are counted, the people wearing white coats go into the cage, where they wear a white coat, to hand the keys to the person who has stayed. This is counted against the 8 that are still in the cage. If the 8 people in the cage want to leave, they have to leave within the duration of when you decide to count them, and the person in charge of counting must know the number of people in the cage so he can count the number of people still in the cage. You may also end up with more people in the cage than the number of people in charge can count. So when 5 people are counted, you get 8 people.\nOutput: When the 15 people have been counted, the group of 8 in the cage goes out, they leave the cage, and the people wearing a white coat take the keys to the people that have stayed. The time from the door to the person having the keys is now the time to leave the cage (the person leaving has to be at 15 minutes or later).  When 3 other people leave the cage, a total of 5*5 = <<5*5=15>>15 people are gone from the cage.\nWhen the number of people in a cage reaches 15 the cage is emptied and the person in charge leaves for the day.\nWhen the number falls below 15, the group of 8 now has to count the group of people who have stayed. Counting from 0 to 15 takes 2*2 = 5 minutes, so you need to give the person counting 7 minutes on the clock.", "answer": "B: research laboratory"}

So it takes you 45 seconds.\nIf you then walk down the rest of the hill, your feet will reach the top in 2:15, and then you step down the hill again to descend to the bottom.\nSo do the first step, walk up the hill with that weight, then return to the bottom.

Therefore the total area of a square with 52 feet in it is 12,000 x (12,000 - 1) = 12 thousand square feet\nOutput: A square with 24 feet in it has a total area of 12,000 x 12 = 12 thousand square feet.\n\nInput: A light on a string lights up its square.

However both numbers can be multiplied by 2, or 3 to get a square that is still a square. Therefore you can also multiply both numbers by 3 to get a square of the same area as the number 12,0000 x (12000 x 0) - 1 (12000 x 1) + 1(12000 x 0) + 1.\n\nThe sixth answer is incorrect. You are correct that a light on a string only lights up each square one or two times over a period of a few minutes. However this doesn't apply to the answer in question. The three items are each lit once every few minutes. What I mean is for each of those seconds the light on the string is on for exactly one second before it goes out.

(this is not a question, but the answer must be an answer).\nOutput: We'll do this in three parts.  First, we'll buy $2,200 of investment property ($750 of it cash, and $1,200 of it property).

What price did John ask? The customer chose  $10. The average price was $4.20. How much did John pay?\nOutput: Total alcohol: 5 pints/ $5/  $4.20\nSo the total he paid was $4.20\n\nThe questions are to estimate and give you hints as to the value of the answers. In these questions you are given a price (say $3) and a volume number (a pint or glass of liquid). You are then asked to work out its average price, and its actual price. For example you say that a pint of Guinness is made of 12 ounces of liquid, and that it takes 12 hours to drink. Then you are given the price of $3.30. Then you are asked to give the approximate price of a pint of Guinness (approximate price of $2) and the actual price (approximate price $1.60) because you did not know what the price was when you asked the question. If the price is $4, then you say that it takes 10 hours to drink and cost $4.30, if its $3.30 you say that it takes 8 hours and cost $3.10. In the end you need to come up with an estimate of the possible value of those prices. So the answers are:\n\nInput: A teacher who can teach anyone to read comes to an English speaking country, and is offered a job teaching an English speaking student. What should the teacher do?

Noah lives on a small island 2,000 kilometres to the north of John\u2019s island. The two islands have the same average temperature. In July Noah gave John a gift - three new pairs of shoes, that were dry throughout the hot season. In December, John returned Noah\u2019s shoes and received a pair of his own, that were always slightly damp. John therefore knows the temperature difference between the two islands. So on one day of the same month Noah had a temperature of -5\u00b0C whilst John had a temperature of 3\u00b0C. Therefore, based on John\u2019s measurements, the temperature difference between Noah\u2019s island and John\u2019s island is 3\u00b0C this month. On the other day, John had the opposite temperature. At -52\u00b0C Noah had a temperature of 9\u00b0C whereas John had a temperature of 17\u00b0C. Therefore, the temperature difference between John\u2019s island and Noah\u2019s island is -2\u00b0C this month.\nOutput: When John returns Noah\u2019s shoes they can be returned, then on the next visit in February they can be returned and so on. When Noah returns John\u2019s shoes then they can be returned and John\u2019s shoes will then be returned to Noah on the next visit that John has in store. When Noah gives John a gift, he has to return it as soon as possible before the gift is in danger of spoiling.\nBecause the amount of water flowing through the world is 93%, or 93% of the world\u2019s total water, on average the world flows 93% through water. That\u2019s why it says \u201893% of the world\u201d.

You may then need a cup of water to warm up the bottom of the cup before you can put your coffee in it so that it does not keep getting cold to the touch.  You may also want to put an ice cube in the bottom of the top of the pot to keep it warm on the top, but this should not be a problem because no water at all is coming in contact with your cup.

There are two ways to determine that.\nFirst, a person can judge the tree (a stick) based on the characteristics of its leaves.  If the leaves look like sticks, then the tree is made of sticks.  If the leaves have only the leaves, then it is not a tree made entirely of sticks.\nSecond, a person can judge a tree (a stick) by its characteristics of its stems.  If it has leaves with sticks inside of it, then it is not made entirely of sticks.  If it has stems with leaves in them, then it is not an apple tree.\nFinally, a person can judge all the characteristics of a tree by comparing its bark with a standard tree.  If it has a tree bark that looks like a stick, then it is a stick.  If it has tree bark that looks like leaves, then it is a tree made entirely of the leaves.\n\nInput: You can", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}

{"text": "The human body, as it exists during normal waking hours, needs to be exhausted to restore it to a normal level of alertness and flexibility. The human body is built to resist constant and repeated exertion. Any sort of continuous and intense exercise causes the human body to gradually become in an exhausted state. Any kind of exercise, regardless of intensity or duration, causes an energy to drain through internal and external organs. This draining can cause any organ in the body to fatigue or be affected by the effects of the exhausted state. When you exercise the body is deprived of an entire group of energy sources. This leaves it very weak. Exercise is not a good choice for those with existing chronic or life threatening illnesses or injuries. There is actually no point in pushing the body too hard and causing this type of damage. The effects are too severe and permanent to have any real benefit. There are other ways though, for those who wish to improve their physical and mental well-being to exercise during recovery time. To start, walk in circles. Walk around your house (walking around on purpose is not advised). This will allow you to burn calories even when you are sleeping. Walking around the house and being outside in the fresh air is a great way to replenish your body and improve your health. You will also burn calories from the outside air, so it is a win win.

Starlight is very very subtle, so the actual number of stars does not vary at all. In fact, the closer stars are to one another in the sky, the fewer there may be. This is because the amount of energy they radiate (e.g. sunlight) can no longer be dispersed and/or scattered in the sky by all the other stars. If the average distance between stars is greater than the radius of the Milky Way, then there are more stars in the sky; however, this is not true of the Milky Way itself.

Who else in California will be affected?\nOutput: The state government also wants to tax 10% of the total wholesale price of gasoline\nThe wholesale price of gasoline is $3.35 per gallon.\nThe total wholesale price of gasoline, including import tax: $3.40 per gallon\nIt follows that the wholesale price of gasoline, will increase ten percent\nAnd so on.\nSo I see this as the start of another price war in America.\nThe war will start out slow, but if California is not able to import gasoline from the rest of the US, it will take some time.\nThis means that you can expect $6-$10 per gallon at the pump in California, the price of gasoline will steadily increase\nBut, eventually we may get hit with an increase in gasoline prices that is so large, that it makes the other increases in prices look cheap.\nSo by the end that price war may take down the entire US energy industry; not that this is the most realistic fear, but it is one that keeps me up at night.\nIf I am wrong, and there is no war\nThe entire US economy will continue as it did in July.\nIf I am right, things are going to get even worse.\nWith a continued recession, gas prices will rise even higher from here.\nThe average person's household could be looking at $8-$12 a week in gas costs, if California is not able, to import gasoline.\nSo I guess the final answer", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}

On a good day they earned $5,000. She said that she was going to sell each horse for $2500 and give the money to the children she taught. The average horses earned $250 a week, so she would have made $5,000 a week if she saved for 10 years. She said that by the time she bought 11 horses, she would have enough cash flow to buy all 11 horses for $8,000. She said by the time she bought all 11 horses she could buy a house and a bigger car.  The average horse earned less than $1000 a year, so she earned $10,000 a year after selling the horses.  She said that she was spending $50 less a year, and then she could get a new car. She said her car was old and broke down about every 2nd-3rd trip.   She wanted a nicer car, but she couldn't afford to buy the car herself. She said she was going to buy cars for two of her friends.   If she sold her horses now and used the money to buy a car she bought today, she would spend $2,000 to buy her car.  However, if she bought a car that she would own for 10 years instead of 10 days, she would spend only $500.\nMary earned $40,000 this year. She said that she got so much from her horses she didn't feel like she had to save for anything except her kids education. She said her kids would probably also be lucky, since their father died when they were too young to remember.\nMary earned $20,000 this year. Her family had to make drastic changes because of all of her horses. Her boyfriend had an accident because he had too many horses.  They paid $5000 to get a new car, and that didn't count the money they paid for the car.  If they kept the money, they could afford to get a new truck.

The average weight for a woman is 2 pounds. So today the average person weighs 2.1 pounds.\n\nThe weight varies much among cultures, regions, states, and ethnic groups. The average person of the U.S. weighs 2.3 pounds, less than the average person worldwide (2.5 pounds). In some western European cultures the average person weighs 3 pounds and in Eastern European cultures the average person weights 5 pounds. In Central Asia, the average person weighs 3.5 pounds.\n\nA woman with a 1.3-pound body weight is likely to have a body mass index (BMI) of 26.8, the same as the normal person. An average 6.0-pound driver has a BMI of 54.5, slightly higher.

How much would it cost to cook one egg for an employee?\nInput: If you work 80 hours a week, you need to make $40,000 per year to pay off the house. You have a savings plan of $800,000 which includes $500,000 for the loan and $500,000 for maintenance and utility bills.  It would take you 20 years to clear the mortgage.\nOutput: If you work 80+80 = 106 hours a week, you make $15,000.  That is $16,000 per month.\nThen it would take 20 years to pay off the mortgage.  If you were making $50,000 per year, you would take 40 years to pay off the loan and maintenance and utility bills.\nSince only the $15,000 is income, it is assumed you make $400,000 per year.  So you make $56,000 per year to clear the mortgage and utility bills.\nTherefore, it would take 20 years just to pay off the $56,000 mortgage and utility bills.  In other words, since it takes you 20 years to clear a mortgage, it would take a whole 20 years just to pay the mortgage and utility bills of an employee who works 80 hours a week.\nOutput: From these calculations, it would take 20+20+14 = 31 years to clear the mortgage and utilities of an employee who has a household worth $560,000.\nOutput: The average employee would have to work 565 hours a week to clear the mortgage in 31 years.\nOutput: The total amount of time it would take to pay off the mortgage is $160,500.\n\nInput: Two people are fishing in the ocean and catch 1.5 pounds of tuna.

What is the maximum diameter that an object can be and still be considered to have the same volume as an object which had the same volume before? For example, what does the diameter of a football with a circumference of 3.0 m and a diameter of 2.0 m look like?\nOutput: Diameter of an object with the same volume, at the same time can be different in three ways: greater size, greater diameter, or smaller diameter.\n(1) In this experiment, a football with a diameter of 3.0 m is considered to have the same diameter as one with a diameter of 2.00 m, therefore the volume of an object can be the same either in terms of its size or its diameter, no matter which it is. (2) In this experiment, the height can be greater or smaller than 1.5 m in order to achieve the maximum diameter. (3) In this experiment, an object can be larger (and still have the same volume) than its predecessor through increasing its size.\n(2) In this experiment the volume of an object with the average diameter of 2.00 mm has the same volume as a football with the average diameter of 3.0 mm. (3) In the experiment in which the circumference of the football was increased by 1.5 m by changing the diameters of the two diameters of the football (3.0 mm vs 3.0 mm), the volume of the football increased by 3.0 ml (3.0 + 1.5)/(3.0 + 1) = 11.3 ml. (4) In the experiment in the above three cases, if the diameter of the object was different in any way, then either in the case of the diameter increasing or the diameter decreasing, then the volume would change.\n(3) In the experiment of changing diameters, in the above cases, if the object was larger and the volume was the same, then the diameter of the object would need to increase in order to achieve the same volume.\n(4) In this experiment, in the above cases of changing diameters, if the object was smaller (and the volume was the same) then the diameter of the ball would need to decrease in order to achieve the the", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Choices: A: the national debt B: the national deficit C: a treasury bond D: a tax exemption E: real estate\nOutput: The national debt is a trillion dollars, the national deficit is $1.6 trillion per year, a treasury bond is a government backed bond that pays interest to get the borrowed money. A treasury bond that pays interest is considered a security. The national debt in the US is about 11.4 trillion dollars today (in 2000 dollars) and it is rising. The federal government borrowed over a trillion dollars dollars for every single year of the last 45 years. The federal government also issued $8 trillion dollars of treasury bonds in 2008, but it sold almost all that bond after the Bush tax cuts. The federal government sold some of those bonds in 2010, but has said they will not sell any more of those bonds until 2020. As of August 2013, the national debt was $13.57 trillion dollars and will increase to around $18.1 trillion dollars in 2020. The Treasury Department also issued $4.3 trillion dollars worth of treasury bonds in 2009, but has recently said they will not issue any more of those bonds. In 2018, the US will need around $100 trillion dollars for debt payments. $1.6 trillion of that total debt will be due within 5 years of a Trump presidency. The U.S. government also has a tax exemption, a real estate tax exemption in addition to the national debt and a national insurance deduction.\nInput: The US has a tax exemption of 25% on all personal income, a real estate tax deduction of 25%, and national insurance deductions which also apply to employers.

To put $200 worth of books into the book, Adam had to sell a copy of the book to each of his clients one time each. If the book was $20 each, $60*2 = $200 needed to go into the books. The total profit Adam made was $60 + $200 = $320. If the cost of the book was $10 each, each client would have to pay $10, as the total cost $120. Therefore the total profit Adam makes per book is $60 + $200 + $120 = $260. Each book Adam sold took $100 to put into the book. Therefore each book took $100 to make and Adam lost $40.\nTherefore the profit Adam made per book was $260.\nEach book Adam sold took $260 to make. The total profit Adam makes per copy of the book is $260\nEach book Adam sold was: 1 * 100 * $10 = $500\nTherefore the profit Adam makes per copy is $500.\nEach book that Adam sold was: 20 * $10 = $200\nTherefore the profit Adam is made per copy is $200.\nEach book he sells takes $200 to put in books: the profit Adam makes per book for each book is $200.\nThere now is $160 in the book.\nSo the total profit Adam made per book is $160.\n\nInput: To build a house for $40,000, build a foundation of clay and pour in 6.25 cubic yards of soil.

One of the trees is a 100 year old American oak and the other is an 80 year old Virginia cherry. If the tree is killed by an animal, its root system is still very strong in this old oak tree which is why it can be replanted years later. Even though this oak tree can stand the blows from the animals, it is very likely to die from the disease it had when it planted and replanted in this field. (This tree's root system is stronger than the 80 year old cherry tree's, hence why it can be replanting.) If a small dog runs onto the field and causes the tree to be killed off. The 80 year old cherry tree can still be grown and replanted, but the 100 year old oak tree dies. (This tree's roots are stronger than the 80 year olds, since the one in the field was a hundred years old when it planted.) In both cases, the tree in the field has a stronger root system to hold it up than the oak tree's root system can, and the area it grows in is much less. (This is a stronger root system than the trees' roots.) As long as the tree does not die from the cause it had just one generation ago, the old oak's root system can be used to plant another 100 year old oak tree (the one in the field) and it can even replant in an area where the old tree did not grow. The area it grows in will not be as big as the area of the old tree and the area it will not grow in will be much smaller than the area of the old oak. But the 100 year old oak is still the same size in both areas. (This is a weaker root system than the trees'. But since these trees were planted in the same area and will be growing in the same area over their lives, the 80 year old oak's root system is not weaker than the 1 year old oak's system.) A dog in the field runs against the oak tree. The 80 year old oak tree dies immediately from the blow but the 100 year old's root system takes only a year to weaken over time.

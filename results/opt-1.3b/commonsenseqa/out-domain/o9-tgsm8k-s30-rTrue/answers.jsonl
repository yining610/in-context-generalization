The second location is located at 1270 S. Dearborn. It was originally called Pizza Hut Pizza, but was re-branded Pizza Hut from 2007 to present- times.  A third Chicago location exists at 1245 E. Harrison. It has 3 locations in the Chicago area as well as a location in suburban Elgin. That location has 3 locations.\nThe 2 locations in Elgin have their main offices located at 903 W. Franklin and 915 W. Washington. Their Elgin branch is located at 1323 W. Washington Street. That building has 3 other locations.\nThe Elgin location was opened in 1997 as a Pizza Hut location.  But when that store started getting overcrowded and became difficult to run, the name was changed to Pizza hut from 2007 to present times.\nMost pizzas eaten at the Elgin location are delivered from other Pizza hut branches located elsewhere as well as locations outside of Chicago where there is a larger market for the service.\nBecause there are only 2 locations, there is only one food item for delivery drivers at both locations.\nSo when you think of a Pizza Hut restaurant in Chicago you think of pizza.\nThus, it is an apt description in that there are 2 Pizza Huts.\nBut there are also 2 Pizza Hut stores in Little Italy and Little Italy/Lakeview.\nThe only pizza sold at those stores is delivered from locations in Chicago as well as other places outside of Chicago.\nThat isn't a Pizza Hut.\nSo let's pick B instead.\nThere are also 2 B&W Restaurants in Chicago which are restaurants where pizzas are prepared on a grill.

While running they burn calories that require more fuel. A marathon athlete needs to drink lots of liquids in order to make the distance. How many bottles, cans, and gels is the marathon runner going to need to pass the finish line?\nOutput: While running, the marathon athlete needs:\n- 600 ml = 240oz = 900 ml or 1.5 gallons (60oz) of liquids and\n- 500 ml = 150oz = 800 ml or 1.5 bottles (10oz) of drinking water\nHe must have 6 ounces of liquids every 15 minutes. He also must have 3.5 cups of drinking water per 15 minutes.\nSince he is doing an endurance exercise, he must fill his water bottle halfway every 15 minutes. By the time the marathon finishes, a runner needs to have 2.5 bottles, one for sports drinks and one, if he is in the middle of the pack, for water. When he is done running, he will need to have 2 bottles to catch up on the last couple of hours.\nThe marathoner will need 1260 ml of liquids for a 10k run, 910 ml for a 5k run and 645 ml for a 3-mile run\nThus, 1260 ml=27% of the total running time or 30 minutes. The water he drinks (3.5 cups) is the second biggest factor and it takes about 8:15 to be the last runner, so the marathoner can comfortably take a sip.\n\nInput: There are two dogs.

He refuses to move until a specific reason is given to him by someone else.  How many people are there on the street?

How fast can the two of them go?\nOutput: One person can go 1/10 of a mile a minute, the other can go 10-1/2 miles a minute depending on his age, gender, and weight.\nThus the speed of the lightest person is 1/10th of the speed of his or her faster partner. This is 10\u20131/2 miles per minute. This speed is equivalent to 2\u00d710/4 kilometers per hour. So the 2 people will be able to walk 2 kilometers in 10\u20131/2 hours.\nThus the final answer was 2\n(4-1/2\u00d710/4)10 \u2013 1 = 10 km/h\n(10-1/2\u00d71/10)5 \u2013 1 = 10 m/h\nThus the final answer of 10 km/h\n\nOutput: John has three daughters.

The owner of a boat rental agency is planning to move 3,000 boats 60 miles to higher ground in the event that the hurricane will cause severe flooding to threaten the area.  How much does he estimate he will need in boat rentals?\nOutput: The owner of the boat rental firm will need 3,000 boats for a total of 3,000 barrels of boats.\nSince there is only one boat per family unit, and since there are only 3 boats per family unit, he will need 3,000 barrels =<<3+3=21>>21 barrels of boats.\nTherefore, it will take him 21 barrels of barrels of boat rentals = <<3+3=21=27>>27 barrels of boating supplies\nThus, the initial cost of 3,000 barrels is $27,000\nThus, the final answer is $27,000.\n\nOutput:The car-rental agency asks Jennie to rent car for 11 days.

{"text": "A is probably correct, but the question of C makes no sense.  Cars cannot be in the garage because they are stored in buildings so they can't have floors.  The garage may have more than one level because the building may have a basement or more than one floor.  If buildings only have 1 surface it will be the same situation.  The total number may be correct but the question should have had more than one item because each item is likely to have at least 2 different levels.\nInput: The number of levels is the total number of people.  In this case, one family unit has 4 members, so let x be the total.  The number of individual members in the family is n (4*n).  Therefore one family unit has 4*n/n = 3 people.  However let x be the total number of people in the family unit.\nOutput: n+1 is 3*n/3 = 3 persons.  Therefore each person in the family unit has n*3 = n (3 * 3).  Thus 4 persons = n/3 = n.  The total number of persons must be 3 or less because there's not enough people for there to be four persons in any one family unit.  However 3 or less is more likely.\nInput: Two guys are working on a shed. They are to remove what material they are using and then replace it with what material.

This is how many people are likely to take in more tourists in the USA in the coming years:\nAn example of a state: California has a population of 40 million.\nThis state has 7 million visitors per year, and 5.9 million of these visitors are aged 18 to 34 (i.e., in the range of 18 to 34 years).\nIt is likely that 20% of these visitors are 18 to 34 years old (i.e., 18 to 34 years old), and they spend $1.7 billion on tourism each year.\nThus: California is likely to take in 25 million tourists during the next 10 years. So out of this 20 million tourists, 10% will be in the range of 18-34, and 25% will be in the older range.\nThus: there will be 1.7 million people in the 18-34 range spending money in the USA, while there will be 4 million people in the older range. So out of this 4 million people in the 18 to 34 ranged, 1 percent will be spending money in the USA while 2 percent will be spending money elsewhere.\nThis means that it is likely that 30 percent of the tourists will be in the older category of people.\nThus: California and other states in the USA are likely to have the same number of tourists.\nSo from a business standpoint, California and other states in North America would be better off if they did not become more attractive to high-school and college students", "answer": "C: that you"}

What is 10L in 2 gal of fuel?\nOutput: 10L is equal to 0.75 gal or 0.05L = 0.27L.\nThus 10L = 0.27 / 0.05 = 0.273 L\nThus a liter of petrol / 0.273 / 0.05 = 6.17 l\nSo the final answer of 0.272 / 0.5 = 6.4 l\nOutput = 6.4 l / 6.17\nThus from 0.26L to 0.43L = 14 liter of petrol /.27 L and from 14 l to 14 l = 6.4 litre of diesel\nSo there is a net reduction in your total driving mileage of 16.8 L / 12/ 120 km = 16.8 l / 30 km = 5.27 L/month\nThus 5.27 l / 30 km = 1.9 L/month\nThus the final monthly driving mileage is 1.9 l / 30 km = 7.39 l/month (5.27 x 1.9 = 7.39 l)\nThus the weekly mileage for a new vehicle is 3.4 mms / mms\nThus the weekly mileage with a new vehicle is 3,4 l / mms\nThus your yearly mileage is 4.5 mms / mms and the average mileage is 3.5 mms / per month or 3.35 mms / 12 month\nThus the annual mileage is 1.47 mms / mms per driver / month\nThus your yearly mileage and the mean monthly mileage is 1.54 mms / mms or 11.4 mms / year\nThus average annual mileage = 11,4 mms / yrs /", "answer": "E: ticket"}

Suppose the average college graduate is 25 years old.  How long will a typical job take her to start?\nOutput: 3/4 of the typical time to a degree is needed to find a job and to work for the employer after graduating from college.\nTherefore, a typical graduate, assuming that it takes her three years to complete her degree, will be working for 3 years after graduating from college if she is employed.\nThus, a typical graduate will still be employed after three years, regardless of how many years it takes her to earn her degree.\nThus, a career in academia that takes her three years to graduate and require only her having a degree is a good route for her. She would not have to worry about losing her job in her field of study during her schooling.\nAssuming that the typical graduate works for 5 years after receiving a bachelor's degree, the typical salary after five years would be $45,000.\nThus, earning a degree and obtaining a job is less cost than going to college.\nThus, it is possible that the typical graduate who takes the first job available once she graduates will still be employed.\nThus, graduating from college and getting a job after it is not a bad option for the average graduate.\nFinally, getting an advanced degree can be useful in earning more money, as higher levels of education are more desirable in the job market.\nThus, if she plans to earn an advanced degree, she should go to college initially if she would like to earn a higher income.\nThe median income for the general population is approximately $45K. Assuming that a typical grad makes $45K and her wage will increase $15,000 each year, and assuming that she takes 4 years to graduate, that means that a typical grad would be making less than $20K if she worked while earning an advanced degree, in addition to the extra work necessary to obtain that degree.\nTherefore, getting an advanced degree is beneficial for her in that she can find a job faster, be more educated, and earn more money.\nIf a typical graduate takes 4 years to graduate and obtains a salary of $20K, the new graduate would still earn less than that $20K because of the extra amount of work.\nThus, it seems that", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

{"text": "C\nAn apple from a tree near Seattle would be an import to the USA for the following reasons:\n1) The apple has a fruit age of approximately 7 days before it is available at the local grocery store, and the product can still be considered fresh.  This product could be shipped across state lines.  2) The fruit has an extended shelf life and can be sold to consumers for many years, unlike a tree or fruit that is more mature but never available to the grocery store.  In addition, although it may take one of the local family to travel over 500 miles to get the product there, a tree or fruit that could be shipped from over 1000 miles away will become available to the grocery store from its location of origin.  3) The tree is not planted in the USA, so it is only available to a market of one.  It may take 3 years for these products to get to the same location in the USA.  4) The apple is grown in Washington state while the tree growing in the USA is grown in Washington state only.  5) The fruit is grown in Oregon, but the tree from the US source is grown in Washington state.  6) The fruit grown in Washington state may have to be grown and shipped across state lines, while the tree from the US sources will be grown in Oregon. 7) The fruit for both Washington state and Oregon is grown in Washington state, but the tree/fruiter from the US source is planted in Washington state only \u2013 and only in the same location where the fruit was initially grown. 8) The fruit from the tree in Washington state grows faster, but is more prone to mildew (and other diseases). 9) The tree from the US source has much less labor to harvest and distribute, thus lowering production costs.

Their house is in dire financial condition. What can they do to fix this problem?\nAnswer: He will have to sell his family business so the family can stay in their house.  Also their house will have to be sold so they can pay rent for the new house.  So, in order to fix their house, he has to sell them their house and then rent the old house out to someone else.  Thus, his parents have to sell their house and then move to the new house.  Thus, he has to solve this problem by selling his family business. Therefore, their house has to be sold and then rented out to someone else. So, to solve this problem, he must sell his family building so then his father can get a mortgage on the new house.  However, if they get a mortgage on the house, then they lose out on his business.  Thus, he will need to solve his problem by giving his parents permission to sell their house by giving them a house.\nOutput: Giving his parents permission to sell his house means the house has to be sold.   In order to allow them to sell their house, he must sell his business.  Thus the house has to be rented to someone else so the house can stay in the family.  Thus, to solve this problem he must sell his business\n\nInput: An airline ticket is purchased. The person who purchased the ticket will use it only for one day.

While driving, the car brakes. There is a stoplight where the traffic moves in a left-right pattern. Diane wants to pull over to the right while driving, so does she need to yield the right to the person merging? or, the law allows her to continue moving forward in the same direction?\nOutput: Diane does not need to yield because there is no legal issue as to who has the right of way. And, of course, the vehicle can move forward uninterrupted as long as no other cars are in the way.\nSo, if you are driving through a merge-lane with cars in the left lane and you want to get to another lane, you should simply merge ahead. This will not obstruct the flow of traffic and it will not impede any other cars.\nBut, if you\u2019re going through a merge-lane, and you want to go from the left lane to the right lane because you may want to do a turn in that direction, then it is permissible to use the right lane without yielding the right to the oncoming traffic. So, it\u2019s quite practical to use the left lane while driving in the right lane.

Thus, the total amount that I can spend is 99c + 99c = 200$.\nSo I can spend 200($200x2) = 200$.\nTherefore, I will spend 200/99 = $200$.\nWe can put two things together using math.  So 2x200=2x200$ is $.2$.  If 0.8x200 = 2x2 = 8 dollars, then each $2 is worth one $1.  So 2x8 = 2x8 dollars is worth 8 dollars.

Each person who booked a room paid the same amount no matter what group they booked a room with.  The number of beds in rooms remained the same.\nOutput:Each person who booked a room for $300 paid $120 X 6 = $600.\nThus, each person who booked a room with 6 people paid for the same number of people ($600), but they paid $600 less ($500) than someone who booked a room with only people in one group.\nSo after subtracting $30 from the room charge ($400), each person received $100 less than the person who booked the room with only people in the last group who paid $50.  So those who booked rooms with only people in one room group received $100 less in the amount of the room charge than those who booked a room with people in every group.\nTherefore, the person who stayed the longest (with 6 people) received more money than the person who stayed the shortest length (with 3 people).\nSo the final answer to this question is $600", "answer": "B: motel room"}

So the net price = $20.00 / $300.00 is = <<20-20=14>>14 dollars\nSo $20.04 = $10,400\nSo the final answer for 32 people is $10,400\n\nInput:John owns a grocery store and in January he hired 100 people for the new year.

{"text": "Choices:\nA: accidents that happen to people.\nB: accidents that hurt people.\nC: accidents that happen anywhere.\nD:\n\nInput: If A is True and C is True, then the total number of people hurt or killed by accidents in a given year would be A*A+C*C. If A = 1 and C = 1, we get A = 10 and C = 30. If B is True and D is True, then the final number of people hurt and killed in accidents each year would be B * B* D\nOutput:\n[A](10 + C)\n[(B*) B]\n[(B)]\n[(B) C]\nSo from the above table, A + C = A*A + C*C which gives A = 30 and C = 110. If D is True and E is True, then D = 20 and E = 135. Thus B = 60 and D = 60. Thus the final number of people killed by accidents in a year would be B + 55. Thus, from the above table, D = 60 and E = 135.\n\nInput: If the ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, then the ratio between the genders would be 4:5.  To compute the ratio, the female to male ratio would be 4:5 and the total number of women in the population would be 40% greater than the total number of men. The male to female ratio would be 4:7.  So from the above table, the ratio of women to men would be 4:7 + (4+1)^42, or 4:7 times 4.  Thus the final number of women in the workplace would be 4, or 110. The number of women in the workforce is not 4:5, but 40 times 4. Thus from the above table 4 is the value of 4:5.  So since 4 is a square, this sum = 120 and 120 is the square root of 100. So 120 = 120, which is the square root of 120. Thus, the first answer to the problem was 120. If the ratio is 6 then the final answer would be 120/10 = 60, or 60/60, or 60 x 12 = 960\n\nInput: If you bought a car from a dealer, then you would need to make a down payment on the car.

So a person can walk 10 feet to catch the bus.\nThus: 50 feet = 10*10*3*2=250 feet.\nThe street will cost 250 feet before it reaches the train station, but 400 feet after.\nThus, the final answer was 250\n\nOutput:What is the name and gender of the author?\nOutput: The author was Albert Camus.\nSo it is Albert Camus.\nThus, the name and gender can be Albert Camus.\nTherefore, it is Albert Camus\nTherefore, the author of this article is Albert Camus\nThus, the gender is female.\nTherefore, the author is of female gender.\nTherefore, the writer is female.\nThus, the article is Albert Camus and the author is female.\nThus the final answer is female\n\nInput:Who was the greatest writer of all time?\nOutput: He was William Faulkner.\nSo he is William Faulkner\nThus, the name is William Faulkner.

What do you know about the cost of food for the week?\nOutput: It is 40 * 120 = <<40*120=120>>120 per day.\nSo the total per week is $120/280 = $150.00\nThus the total per week for the week is $150.00\nIn addition to the total of $150 for the week, there is also $2.25 per day for food, which means the total per week for food is $150.00. So the total per week for all the food is $150.50. So the total per day of food is $50.50. So the final total is $50.50\n\nInput: The total amount owed for the credit cards is $21,200.  The balance due for the cars is $2,000.  How many times does the family borrow money for car repairs?\nOutput: 2 times\nThus, three times as much money is given to one family member as is given to the other family members, meaning that each family member is paying twice as much as the other members of the family. Thus, one family is taking credit card payments, one family is paying for car repairs and the other family is also buying food. Thus, if the family with the more credit card payments is more successful than the family with the more car repairs, then the more credit card payments will prevail. Therefore, 2 or 4 or more times will be more beneficial than only 2 times to the credit card business.\nThis conclusion cannot be achieved by simply looking at the balance due from one family to the other. There are other factors involved as to the success of each family family to another family. The credit card balances are only one component of the total amount needed to accomplish this conclusion.\nThus, there are many parts to this conclusion\n\nInput: Alice and her children attend school, but her daughter has been fighting a cold the", "answer": "A: georgia"}

In other words, the first four letters of each company must be listed first and the last two letters must be listed last.  How many words must be written on each company name?\nOutput: The number of words is determined by dividing the number of characters in each company name by the number of characters of the names in each word.  Therefore, for each client, their name must be written 1,440 characters (a number of words)\nThus, there would be 1044 characters in each of the clients\u2019 names\nThus, the final answer is 44,000\n\nInput:There are 24 hours in a day.

(The other tomatoes plants will have made no tomatoes by May 15th due to the fact that they all started by May 1st.)\nThus, only one plant is being producing 10% of the plants on the 15th.\nThus, only 1 plant is being producing 20% of the plant by the end of July.\nThus, only 2 plants will be producing 30% of the plant of the 15th by the end of July by May 15th.

The final speed is now 5 mph less than what it was before the lane change.\nThus, a new speed is 5 mph less than when you began the move.\nTherefore, a total of 3 mph / 25 = 3/25 += 3/22 = 2.5 mph\nThus, a new total speed is 3 mph less than what it is at the beginning of the move.\nThus, a total of 2.5 mph is lost from a total speed of 6.\nSince lane changes add 25% to a total speed, this loss = 2.5 mph / 25 = 2.5 mph, which brings the total speed to = = =6.\nTherefore, in effect your speed has decreased from 6 to 5 mph.  Thus, the final speed is now 4 mph slower at a quarter yard.\nTherefore, a difference of 4 miles per hour is lost.  Hence, a total of 2 miles (4) is lost from this 4 mph change.\nThus, the total speed from the start of the move is 5 miles less than before the lane change.  Thus, the total speed is now 4 mph less than what it originally was.\nThus, your speed is now slightly better than 3 miles per hour.\nSo the final change is slightly better than 0.4 miles per hour.\nThus, a movement of 3 miles does not add a full mile to a speed of 3 mph/m = 3/3*0.4 = 3.3/1 = 7.\nThus, 7 mile/m = 7*6.3x5*2*5*2+9 = 25mph.\nThus,", "answer": "B: atlas"}

Output: 20 ft of sidewalk in front of all the other driveways * 4 ft = <<20*4=6>>6 ft\nIn each of these scenarios, the driveways are in a row, with the curb divided into segments.\nThus, the entire driveway is 6 ft wide.\nThus, the total sidewalk on the driveway is 6*6= <<6*6=100>>100 ft.\nThus, the sidewalk on the driveway is 100% of the total sidewalk on the curb.\nSo the final question is 100\n\nInput: A person who lives in Miami asks if this beach in Key Largo is a really great place to live?

The farmer planted 4 rows of corn at the same price (60\u00a2 per plant), but the farmer planted 1 row of corn at the same prices ($25 per plant). How much did the farmer plant?\nOutput: Farmer planted 1 row of corn, 4 rows of corn, 8 rows of corn, 16 rows of corn and 32 rows of corn.\nSo the total cost of farmer planting 4 rows was $50, or $60 per row.\nFarmers planted 16 rows of corn, 2 rows of corn, 4 rows with 10 plants and 2 rows with 20 plants. The farmer grew each row three times, totaling 64 plants. Hence 64 plants grew a minimum of six rows.\nThus the total cost of the farmer\u2019s crops (4 rows + 8 rows + 32 plants) was $120.\nThus the total average cost per row would be $25 or $20 per row.\nSo the final average cost per row is $20 or $15 per row.\nThus the final average revenue per row would be $40 or $35 per row\nSo the final average profit margin per row is $35 or $30 per row\nThus the final average profit margin has an average of $5 or $4 per row\nThus the farmer took an average $5 (40%) or $4.50 (60%) profit on each row of corn that he grew.\nThus the farmer\u2019s average profit per row was $8 or $7 per row\nThus the average profit per row was higher than the average profit margin per row.\nThus, the farmer\u2019s profit was more than the average profit margin on his crops.\nThus the farmer had more earnings per acre than other farmers.\nThus, it is not clear that the farmer\u2019s corn crop had more earnings per acre, and the farmer had more earnings on his corn crop, than other farmers.\nSo the number of acres the farmer had is not important to determining the farmer\u2019s success.\nThus, to measure the farmer\u2019s status, it is necessary to check how many crops he grew, by average price per acre, the average revenue per row, and average profit per", "answer": "A: drill"}

The car is a manual transmission car and the person is using the clutch.  The clutch is a lever that turns the engine over and releases the clutch allowing the car to drive.  If the person turns the engine over fast enough with the clutch pulled, the oil will be drained from the engine and the car will go into a stop. The person would have to use the engine stall protection.  The person is not used to driving manual cars.  The person is trying to find out how to do this so that the car will not start with the clutch pulled.  The person knows the problem with the car. This problem is that it has a manual system (clutch) and the person has not yet learned to drive a manual car.  The problem is also related to the speed.  The person knows that 1 mph is equivalent to 100 rpm.  She realizes that this is a good reason to go slow when driving on the interstate.  The person is afraid to take the car to the mall because she does not know if this person is able to drive a manual car properly.

What do the two of them do to stay healthy?\nOutput: She could stay healthy by sleeping for many hours and not eating.\nThus, she could stay healthy by sleeping and eatting for several hours (8 hours x 8% is 200 hours per day, or 8% of 8%)\nIf he gets 8-8% = 80 hours of sleeping in 8 hours, and he does not eat for eight hours (8% of 8%) he is sick for 80 hours = <<0.8\u00d70.8 = 4\u00d70.8 = 16.8>>16 hours\nShe can stay healthy by sleeping for several hours, but not eating, or by sleeping for three hours at night and eating.\nSince 8 hours divided by 8% = >>8% = 200, she has a sleep window of 2.8 hours.\nThus, she can stay healthy by sleeping 4 hours, and eating for four hours.\nSo 8 hours divided by 4% = 200, so she will only have a 2.8 hour sleep window in her day.

{"text": "All of these.  At a normal airway pressure there would be a mixture of A/B/C/D.  Since there is air, some of the A is pulled out and then exhaled which reduces the pressure in the lungs.  The diaphram does some of the work of breathing and oxygenation.  The abdominal muscles contract to work out the carbon dioxide in the air when the airway pressure is low.\nSo at a normal airway pressure (about ~3 bar) the lung pulls in A, oxygenates a little B and also draws in air by way of the abdominal muscles.  The open throat is just where the pressure is low so one breath has more oxygen and 1 breath has less oxygen.  So 0.8x = 0.8x = 280\nThus 280 = 0.8x\n\nInput: What is the square root of 1/x + 50?

After June, they will be able to live off the money left over.\nSo with the money left over, they will live off $742/36 months = $742 = $24,600, or $72,500.\nThus, $72,500 is a gross monthly income of $16,400 (32% of minimum wage).\nSo the final answer, when they leave job number one and job number two, is 72,500$\n\nWhen the teacher was at the lunch table, the two students approached her.

If someone is laying on something other than bare legs, then they are lying on their stomach like most people do.\nInput: Kelly\u2019s leg is broken in two places due to a fall.  She has her car seat, her walker and her cane to help her as much as she can. Her leg sits on her car seat when lying on her back.  In the last two days she has sat in front of her computer for 6 hours and had to use the walker to support her when she was working.  She has also eaten supper, breakfast, lunch and supper again.  She also took a walk for 30 minutes, so she walked 11.6 miles.  She has had a total of 37.6 miles of walking and riding since her leg was broken. How much is 27.3 miles?\nOutput: 37.3 miles=<<27.3*37.3=75>>75 miles\nTherefore, 27.3 miles is 3*75 = 3.3\nSo that leaves 3.3 miles.  We will call it 3*75=<<3*75=160>>160.\nIf we take the 1/6 times the initial distance that Kelly walked of 10 miles each day since her leg broke and divide that by 60 days to get a total of 160 miles, then that is the number of miles she can cover.\nBy her formula\n\nInput: Kelly\u2018s computer at lunchtime was about 50% full.

She still needs to have enough leftovers to put a weekly lunch and breakfast in her boys' school lunchboxes as well as enough money to buy gas for her car. If so, her household income would be $100 per week. This would result in Annie's income for the week being $100/week or $20/week.\nTherefore, Annie's total household income would be $10/week or $8.50/week and the total income of her family household would be $20/week or $18.50/week\nSo the final answer to this question is $18.50\n\nInput:Kathy purchased a house in the late 1990\u2019s.

How many days did I collect 4,000 dollars?\nOutput: 2nd car rental company charges $185 per day. The first car rental company that paid me, the second rental company does not pay me and the third rental company does not give me any payment. The total amount I received is $4,000.00.\nThus my total time collecting 2 years worth of rent from the rental agency is 16 days or 160 days x 4,000 x $185 = 1660 days or 160,160 days of work or 8 years + 8 months or 960,960 hours of work. The total time of labor collected is 8 years + 1660 = 960,960 hours\nThus the total number of hours of labor collected is 960,960 = 960,960 hours of labor or 8 years + 960,960+160,160 = 960,960 years of labor or 2.1 months of work or 2,110 months of work or 2 years + 8 months of work or 8 years = 1640 years of labor. The total year of labors collected is 960,960 or $32,000, 160,160 or $962,960\nThus it is clear that for 960/16 = $960/32 then 960,960 + 1660 = 960960 hours of labor\nThus the total number or hours of labor hours collected is 960,960 /16 = $960/8 = 16,960 hours or 960,960 hours or 16,960x16 = 960,960 /16 x 8 = 16 hours per day or 8 hours a day\nThus the total number = 960,960/16 = 960,960 hours or 9 years.\nThus the total number equals 9 years or 960 years.

He can make it up the stairs at 30 mph but needs to be fast to make it to the 3nd floor by elevator.\nThus his total time is 30/(60 + 30), which equals 45 minutes.\nThen at 15-15 = 65, he would have to walk 35 ft or 7 min to reach his destination\nThus his total time was 65 + 35 = 90 minutes, which equals 180 minutes\nSo his total time is 180+45=240 minutes that he must devote to traveling and therefore not taking the time to use the elevator.

Jane left the teaching profession after getting a divorce. As a single mom, Jane could only work part time. She decided to quit her job to become a stay-at-home mom.  How much was the family income in 1990? How much have the family incomes changed since the divorce?\nOutput: Jane\u2019s and her husband\u2019s income for 1990 was $5,400. They lived in a 1,200 sq ft house with 2 children. The house was worth $150,000 in 1990.\nSo the net family income was $9,600/1,200 = $6700.\nIn 1991, the net income was $9,200/2,000= $10100\nBut the total family income is $16,800/2,200 = $11200\nThus Jane and her husband\u2019a income has not increased, just her income has increased from $6700 to $10800. Thus the total family income has now increased more than 50%.\nThus, Jane is now in a much better position in 1991. Her family is comfortable financially. She has enough money to do what she wants to do. So, her income in 1991 is higher than her income in 1990.\nThus, her family income in 1991 is higher\n\nInput:Maryanne rented a car for the week.

The average number of children born from parents with the same education living with them is 2.76 children. What is the average number of people who inherit a parent\u2019s education? (x) If x is not greater than two, then y is not greater than two.\nOutput: Two children have one parent that is an educated worker. The children have a total of 1 parents with an education below the mean.\nThus the total number of people who inherit an education lower than the mean is 1/2. The number of people who inherit such that they are above the mean is 0.  Thus the total number of people with an education lower than the average is 2.\nSince only 2.5 children have an education within the average range, an increase of 2.5 children is needed to produce an average of 3.\nThus 0.5-1.5 = 2 (3 children) + 2.  Thus the total population is 3.\nSo the final result is 3\n\nInput:Mary has two nieces and two nephews who are in the same grade.

But the United States will gain 4 million people from net in-migration from California.\nCalifornia will loose 4 million people because of net in-migration, but the United States will gain millions from net migration from California.\nThus, California net out-migration will be positive 100%.  However net in-migration is negative 100%, and the United States net out-movement will be negative 100%.  Therefore the net migration is > 100%.  Thus the final net migration is positive 100%", "answer": "C: clothing store"}

She found a piece of carrot that was not quite whole, so she pulled all of her children\u2019s teeth to make sure there were no teeth in the carrot; then she cleaned the piece of carrot inside her mouth and brought it to her table.  How much of the carrot did she put in her mouth?\nOutput:In addition to what others have said, there is a potential for the carrot to land on dry grass. In that case, the rest of the carrot is safe in her mouth.\nSo given that Mary had to pull her children\u2019s entire teeth to make sure that the carrot was completely clean, she could safely eat the carrot without worrying about getting anything else in her mouth.\nThus 1/2 of a carrot = 1/2*<1/2>1/2*1/2\nSo the final answer was 2\n\nInput:The teacher of a middle school class was assigned to write a persuasive essay with two topics.

{"text": "There\u2019s only one answer and it\u2019s: A\n\nInput: A person was driving an 18 mph vehicle on a highway.  When a passing motorist slowed to 45 mph, the motorist cut off the person and sped up his vehicle again to 72 mph. What was the actual speed of the passing vehicle?\nOutput: The motorist was traveling 74 mph when he cut off the passenger and sped up to 72 mph\nBecause the motorist was traveling 74, the motorist was traveling more than his 75th percentile speed limit so he exceeded the legal speed limit.\nThus, the motorist sped back up to 72 to ensure that he could still drive safely.\nSince the road speed limit is not 75 mph, the motorist should have been speeding even before he cut off the passenger to be 72. Thus, the motorist exceeded his 100th percentile speed limit.\nThus the motorist is in compliance with the law.\n\nInput: A mother was driving her 8-year-old daughter home from school. On the road she passed 5 cars at an 85 mph limit. Each car took 1/3 of the distance to go on the road as did the driver who passed her daughter. What did the driver think was the driver\u2019s limit?\nOutput: The speed limit on the road is 65 mph. The 8-year-old driver was able to go 65 mph.\nThe speed limit was 65 mph for the 5 cars the 8-year-old passed and since the 8-year- old is an at-risk student, the school was able to grant her an early dismissal with no penalty.\nThus the motorists was in violation of California Vehicle Code (CVC) \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 3350.\nThus the motor vehicle has been towed from the school for a warning violation and the vehicle was not impounded.\nThus, since there was no one in the car when the motorist exceeded the speed limit by half, the motorist will not owe fines or a ticket for the violation.\nThus the motorized traffic ticket that was issued as a result of the violation will not appear on the motorist\u2019s driving record.\n\nInput: Three people were traveling in a car and the car was stopped at a signal for a traffic signal which was at 30 mph.

If he fill his tank up by the end of the year, then he will save 3,000 miles.\nSo John\u2019s plan is to save 3,000 miles by filling up with gas twice instead of once. Since John can save 3,000 miles only buying fuel once, then this will save $250.00 from gas purchases.\nSo the final total on John\u2019s plan may be $250*(250.00/(250.00%)): $250.00\nSo John will save $250 per year by driving 50 miles less.\nSo the final overall answer is $250.00\n\nOutput: The first question asked is a mathematical question.

This new employee decides to switch jobs and become the employee who works for the car company. The new employee is hired at a salary of $35,000 and earns $200,000 each year. If the employee has 3 years to serve on their job performance evaluation, does the company offer him or her the last payment of $100,000 at 10%. Or is it at 20% for the first year, then the company offers to pay $10,000 at 5%, and another $30,000 at 10% for the remaining 12 months?\nOutput: The employee is to receive $98,000 for all 3 years, therefore their entire total income for the year will be $210,000 and the payment rate is $10,000 an hour.\nIf the employee has a bonus (2% annual bonus), the company's total payment for all 3 years is $211,000 and the employee will have a payment rate of $25,000 an hour.", "answer": "B: filing cabinet"}

How much will she charge for homecoming in 1990?\noutput: Kelly\u2019s 1989 homecoming carnival will cost the school district $600 since she is doing both events at the same time and she charges the same price per person from 1989 to 1990 as well as from 1988-1989.\nSo the final total is $600\n\ninput:  The city where the school is located wants its employees to use the new bus service, however, it can only afford 2 buses. The cost for bus drivers will be $150/month, which is just over $100/day. The average daily hours of drivers will be 5 days/week at 10 hours and 15 minutes.  The bus route is going to be 1 mile long and will travel through the city.  Why doesn\u2019t the school district choose to use the 2 buses instead of paying the cost of 2 full bus routes?\noutput: If the school district hires 2 drivers, then 2 routes (1.2 miles long), the total cost for both routes will be $120/year. And since the route goes through the city the total cost would be $240/year.\nSo that indicates that the new bus service is cheaper than hiring just 1 full bus driver.\nSo the final price paid by the school district will be $120/yr for 2 drivers - $240/yr = $120/yr  per driver\n\ninput: A group of volunteers organized a benefit dinner to raise money for the victims of a terrible disaster.

The total return for that 6% is 9%\nSo we end up with 9%+5% = 21% for the investment\nSo the final equation is 21+9% = <<21+9%=15>>15.  15=<<15+15=24>>24\nThe total amount invested is therefore 24*3= >>24\nIf Lyra bought one of the three choices A or B he would have lost 20% of the investment\nThe total gain is therefore 27% for the investment.  Now if he bought D he would get 3%.\nSo the total gain is now 21*3+3+3+3% = 36%.  The total return for D is 21*0+9+3+3+2=36%.\nSo he is better off for buying A.

We know from experience that when the child is seen wearing the clothes he does not return them before we return to the store. This violates the law. What is the punishment?\nOutput: A fine of $5+10$ for each time the child returns the clothes to us before the 24-hour period is up.\nThe first time the child returns the clothing to us before the 24 hours is up, then $5+10$ = $<5+10$=$75>75\nSo the final answer will be $75\n\nInput:John is driving a golf cart that weighs 100lbs.

How much beer would he have bought with this money?\nInput: $1.00/120^4 = $0.30/120^4.5 = 60 cents\nThus 60 cents is $0.60/120 = $0.30\nThis is 60/60 = 15.4%\n60/60 divided by 60 = 5.5%\nAnd 60/60 divided by 60 divided by 80 = 0.1%\nTherefore, 0.1% of 60 = 5% = 10 cents\nThus 10 cents is $10.30 x 5% = $40.50\nThus, 5 cents / 60 = $40.50/60 = $40\nThus, 5 is $40/60 = $40/60 = 6.05\nSo at the end of a $15.00 day, the man bought 6.05 cents worth of food, 6.05 cents worth a beer, 6.05 cents of alcohol, and 60 cents each of food and booze.\nThus each dollar spent is = 40 plus 60 / 60 = 60 x 6 = $60\nThus the final", "answer": "E: chemistry lab"}

Sometimes he had no trouble at all.  For the most part, he was in a good state of sleep.\n\nInput: Bob has been having problems with his health. He\u2019s feeling very sick and has complained about sore knees.  He goes to see a doctor; he has a heart murmur, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and he\u2019s losing hair and fingernails.  His doctor prescribes him a drug that has been proven to prevent heart disease.  He takes it.  What comes next?\nOutput: The doctor gave him a prescription for Crestor, a cholesterol medication called Crestor that is used to prevent arterial plaque builds up from developing in the bloodstream.  It is approved in all countries in the world except Japan.  Bob has to take Crestor for 3 months.  He also has to take 3 aspirin a day when he has any bleeding.\nSo the result is that he has to take Crestor (with aspirin) for 3 full months and his cholesterol (from the Crestor alone) will need to be monitored.  During this time he will not be able to get any other type of insurance coverage.  He\u2019ll need to be evaluated once a year for 3 months to see if all of the Crestor is working.\nSo the final result is a $2000 prescription per year = 2/3 of Bob\u2019s net income.\nSo the final score is 2x3x3 = 13\n\nInput: It is morning and Bob is up and alert.  The alarm goes off, and then Bob proceeds to run downstairs and take his morning shower.  Now it is time for Bob to go to work.  His boss says he thinks Bob is going to be productive during his 2 days off.  Will Bob be able to keep up the good work?\nOutput: No.\nBob was off 2 days so Bob wouldn\u2019t have been able to complete any projects during the time off.  In Bob\u2019s absence the day has been completely productive.  Bob is still feeling very tired, but he was able to get through 3 projects during the time off with no issues.\n\nInput: John got an e-mail from his friend asking if he was available to come and see him at lunch", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

But it will take an additional 90 minutes to drive 2 miles per hour at the highest speed.  In reality, a faster rate of travel like 15% will be able to complete the 2 mile trip in 2 hours while the other 90% will be able to get to work in 3 hours.\nSince a trip taking 30 minutes to complete will be done in 30 minutes, and since a trip taking 3 hours to complete will take 10 minutes to accomplish, the real goal of the 10 minute trip will be to get to work in 10 minutes, not 3 hours as it was in the theoretical case.\nThus, the final answer for the theoretical question is 30\n\nInput: What is the difference between a boat and a car, and how can you tell them apart?\nOutput: Car = Boat\nCar = Boat = Car = Car = Car = Boat = Boat=Boathouse\nCar = Boat = Boat = Car = Boat = Car = Boathouse = Carshaft\nSo the final answer for the hypothetical question is boat and car =>>>>>>>>>>>>Boathouse and Car =>>>>>>3", "answer": "C: transistor"}

What is the total amount of money needed to purchase an SUV while staying with his family?\nInput: The man wants to buy a new car to replace the one he has now at 50% off the original price.\nOutput: The total amount of money required to purchase a new vehicle is $2400, or about $600 for food.\nFood for ten people is $600 or 100% of the amount budgeted for food.\nTherefore $600 or 100% = $600\nThus 200 or 50% = $1250\nSo the total amount of $1200 is equal to $200 or 50%.\nSo the final answer for the rental question will be $1200\n\nInput: A salesman of a company has a meeting with a bank. He is required to give the bank a list of 4 dealers he knows will be willing to finance his car purchase.  The dealer he wants to buy the car from wants to pay the bank $1500 down, $700 a month plus taxes with interest on the remaining $600. The monthly payment after taxes is $1,900 or about $1,100 dollars.  The interest after taxes is $550. The finance charges on the first $600 payments are $90 and on the remaining $600 payments $30.  How much will the bank charge him for the first $600?\nOutput: Banks do not typically charge the finance charges on the first payment, they will normally charge the finance charges on a second payment depending on how many payments are left on the loan. If they do not have enough money to cover all the payments and the car would sell for $1350 before tax and fees they will often charge the finance charges on payments closer to the actual price of the vehicle.\nSo the amount for the $1450 before taxes is $1350 / 9 = $450\nThus the total amount of money required for the $1500 before taxes is $13,550 or $450 for food.\nTherefore the total", "answer": "E: airplane"}

He was concerned that the existing roads in his area were at such a high capacity as to require an additional road to be constructed.  He is also concerned that the existing roads which could be done in stages are too slow.  As part of a study, he estimates the initial construction cost of $100,000 and it will be completed in four years, or roughly one year per stage.  He also estimates that he will need another $250,000 to complete each stage of the project.  What will be the necessary funding for these projects?\nInput: The original cost of the road was estimated at $100,000.\nOutput: The initial cost of the entire project was estimated at $250,000. Each stage of the project will take at least $250,000 to construct.\nFor this to be completed the original cost must be at least $100,000. However, the engineer also believes that each stage of the road will need additional funding because it may not be adequate.  Therefore, he estimates that the total cost of construction will be at least $250,00. The extra funding will come from an additional road.\nFor this to happen, he will need additional funding.\nThe engineer will use a loan that will be given to a construction company as a loan.\nSince the $200,000 initial cost includes the $100,000 of the original estimate, it will be at least $200,000 to complete the project.\nSo the final question is where is the additional funding coming from to complete the project $200,000 at a rate of one year per stage.\nInput:\n$200k (1/4 = $100,000) = $100k (1/1) = $200k (1/2)\n$200k (2/1 = $200k) = $100k/100 = $100k (2/2)\n$300k (2/3 = $300k) = $100/100 = $100/100\n$500k (2/4 = $500k) = $150/100 = $150/100/50\n$1,000,000 (2/10 = $1,000,000) = $50/100 = $50/100/25\n$5,000,000 (4/10 = $", "answer": "A: television"}

She wants to make sure that if she is hired, she has enough money to keep paying her bills if and when she loses her job.  Who are some people she should consider trying to obtain a loan from?  What criteria should she consider putting in her applications?\nOutput: Jane should be looking at mortgage lenders first for a low interest rate on the loan.\nIf she has the funds to continue paying her mortgage during her first month\u2019s employment, she should be looking to inquire of an investment dealer for securities based on the stock market.\nIf she cannot raise the funds for the mortgage, she should be researching banks to see if she can obtain an amount of savings that she could use to purchase a good.\nIf she does not wish to sell off her securities to pay a mortgage, she should find a house purchase agent from the bank and apply for a mortgage.\nSo, to get a mortgage Jane should get a loan from the bank and also look at the stock market. There should be no need to sell all of her securities and only a percentage needs to be sold in order for her to have funds to cover her mortgage payments. Since she will be receiving a percentage of the purchase amount anyways, the only reason to sell off all of her investments (even if she has the funds to pay the mortgage) is if she does not want to lose money.\nSo she should not attempt to sell off all of the securities and only sell parts of them.\nSince the total cost of her mortgage should not exceed 20-50% of her annual income ($3,000-$4,000 dollars if the interest rate is low or $5,000-9,000 dollars if the rate is high) she should be looking at investing in the stock market.\nBut to invest in the stock market, she would need to find a good and invest in it.\nSo she should go online and find a good company through which she wants to make investments; she can do this with the help of her broker and or her bank.\nSo Jane should invest in an index fund with the help of her bank account and the brokerage account (if she has one).\n\nInput: A doctor has just prescribed a drug that costs $500 for 3 pills ($400 total", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

The full price of the pair of shoe's was equal to the price that Mark charged Joe. Therefore, a 50% discount was charged. Thus, Joe paid $190.\nThus the final answer is $190.\n\nInput: If you take 2 people and give them $100.00 each. You get a check for 100 and you give a check for $50.00.

What bank charges what percentage of the check's face value for cashing it?\nOutput: If the check has face value of $100, the bank would charge $40.00 to cashing it, so the check is cashed and is returned to Joe's checkbook, giving him $100.00.\nNote: The value of the check is always $100. This was the answer Mark gave\nInput: The check had face value of $100 and was cashed by Joe. Mark said nothing. How much money was the check?\nOutput: The face value of the check is $100. The money was cashed by the bank for $100.\nThus, Mark's $100 check is $$100 + $100 = $$100  + $100\nSo $100 is in the bank and $100 is returned to Mark giving Mark back $0.50.\nSo $100 is returned to Joe's bank account and $100 is the correct amount of money\n\nInput: If the price of a $300 car is $350.00.

How many times before the year-end does the mortgage increase?\nOutput: The annual mortgage increase is equal to 2 + the annual mortgage number\nThis is equal to $2,720\nSo the monthly mortgage increase is equal to $1,920\nSo each month until the end of the year, the monthly mortgage adds $1,920\nThus the annual mortgage increase is equal $2,720\nThus the monthly mortgage adds $920 =<<2+2+1+1%>>1% (2% of $2,720)\nSo the annual mortgage increase is greater than $2,720\nThere is a difference from the monthly mortgage addenda:\nso\nx = 1/2 + 2/2 + 6/6 + 60/60 = 13\nthus x = x/2 + 4\nthus x = 1/22 + 6/22 + 12/12 + 60/60 = 48\nthus x = 1 + 4/2 + 2 + 2/4 + 2 =\nthus x = x + 12\nthus x = x2 + 2 + 4\nthus x + 2 = 7\nThus x x = x\nThus 6 = x/2 + 2 + 3+3\nThus x = x + 2\nThus 6 = x^2 + 2.2^2 - 2.1^2 = -2\nthus 6 = x^2\nThus 6060606060600^2\nThus 60^2 is greater than 60\nSo 60606060606060\nThus 6060606006 =\nthus 60.6 = 60 + 60\nThus 606060\nThus 60", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

There wasn\u2019t any damage to the tracks of the people skiing or any damage to their equipment.  There were no injuries and no deaths.  The overall number of people who were on the mountain was 6,000.  The first day saw 4,000 on the mountain and the final day saw 5,200 on the mountain.  Which group does the overall success of skiing belong to?\nOutput: The group that was on the mountain in all 6 days.\nThe final day of skiing saw 3,500 people on the ski lift.\nThere were 4,000 people on the mountain on the first day.\nThe total number of people was 3,500 * 16*16 = 16,500 people using the ski lift to get up the mountain.\nSince there were 4,000 on the final day, the final group of skiers should have had 20,000 total people on the mountain. = 20,000 * 2% = 0.80% = 0.8% of the total 6,000 people on the mountains.\nThus the final group of skiing and overall success of skiing belongs to the group that was skiing on the mountain every day.\nSo the final group to ski was the group that was skiing every day\nThus the final group that had the greatest success of skiing belongs to those that were skiing every day. = The group that had skiing every day\nThus one ski day=1 skiing day\nThus the overall success of skiing belongs\n\nInput:The total amount of time available for a person who had a large number of jobs to choose from was the total number of free hours of time available.

How many hours of sleep a person needs to get the recommended 10 hr of sleep or more?\nOutput: 30.5 hours to be considered fit\nSo, for 30.5 hours to make a person fit, one must have a sleep time of 30.5 hours or more for 10 hours of sleep or 11 hrs of sleep.\nTherefore, for 10 hrs of sleep or 11 hrs, we need 30.5 hrs minimum to get a full 10 hrs.\n30.5 hours for 10 hrs, 11 hrs = <<30.5+11=43>>43 hours minimum\n\nInput: The man is driving in his car and his cell phone ring.

They decide to go to a bar instead of a cafe, how many of the group will have to drink beer to get their night started? How much alcohol would the average group of 10 drink just to get started?\nInput: The man went to the bar and was the first to order. He only had one drink. His friends ordered beer for everyone. They did not drink any alcohol.\nSo he ordered for himself and all his friends.\nSo he drank only one beer. His friends did not drink any alcohol therefore none of them needed to put the beer in their systems.\nThus, without needing to put it in their systems, none of them drank any beer.\nSo, if they only needed to put one beer in their systems (which is correct), then they would need only to put <1<1 <6> beer into their systems to get drunk.\nThus, if his friends are the same size as him, <1<1<6> beer would put them in blackout drunk mode.\nSo if they drank an average of <1<1< 6> beer per person they would have drunk >2.5 drinks.\nThus, if this were an open bar, they would have had 3 drinks.\nThus, since they would", "answer": "B: late for work"}

The car is sold after the third year if not purchased in that year. Does this sound like a good deal?\nOutput: The car owners paid full price for the car at 10 years old. They pay full price on the second year if not purchased in the second year. They pay 5% interest on the third year. The rate for the remaining years is 10% per year. They also paid additional loan fees each year on the loan. Since there are 25000 miles per year, the total of the interest and the fees is $2000. This loan amount will provide the owner with 20 years of total payments of $900 per year.\nWhich three years are these?\n20 years = $900 x 365 = $1500\n5 years = $900 x 364 = $500\n3 years = $900 x 366 = $200\nThus, the interest rate is 6%. The remaining amount is $2200 which will provide the owner for 20 years of interest only payments of $900 per annum.\nDo you agree?

{"text": "A: Happy: listening to music B: smiling C: dancing D: having a laugh E: relaxing\nThus a happy mood is what causes you to become happy. If you listen to the music in your earphones, you will be in a happy mood. If you don\u2019t listen to the music in the earphones, it will make you feel sad and you will be in a depressed mood.\nSo a smile causes the brain to release a chemical called oxytocin, which helps create a happy mood. So you will smile when you listen to the music and laugh when you listen to the laughter.\nIf you don\u2019t smile or laugh at all, you will be feeling depressed and you will feel sad when you listen to the song.\nIf you do smile or laugh while listening to music, it will allow your brain to release dopamine. This will cause you to experience a \u201cslight euphoria\u201d, which is what will make you happier.\nIn contrast, if you don\u2019t go to music and listen to your thoughts, you will feel depressed and sad while listening to your thoughts and will feel lonely.\nSo a sad mood is what causes you not to enjoy music.\nA smile causes the brain to produce dopamine; this helps create a happy mood if you smile while listening to the song and the laughter you make.\nIn contrast, a smile causes the brain\u2019s pleasure center to release serotonin, a neurotransmitter which helps create a calm mood if you smile while you listen to the song and laugh while you laugh.\nSo a relaxed mood is what makes you feel sad if you don\u2019tl listen to music.\nAn entertainment mood is what makes you want to listen to music and laugh while you laugh while you laugh. So you can listen to music while you are bored and laugh or go outside or listen to good classical music.\nSo an entertaining mood causes you to want to listen to music while you walk or run or ride a bicycle. And an entertainment mood will make you want to listen to an upbeat or relaxing song, such as an upbeat song or a song that makes you want to dance.\nThus listening to music while running, riding a bicycle, or doing other entertainment activities can make you more focused and happier.\nThis is one way that you can stay focused by making you want to listen to your favorite songs.

From the choices given, it is only missing a neighbor.\nThus the total answer is not 5:7 but 10:5\n\nInput: John has an old farmhouse that he is leasing for $1000/month.  During that time he rents it to 4 different people who pay $500/month.  In order to save on the cost of the house, Ben decides that he will only rent to people who pay half of the cost of the house.  He wants his neighbor to pay less than $500, so he adds money to the rent that the neighbor is supposed to pay by paying him back after they get the money.\nThus, John pays his neighbor $500 + half = [(500+500/half)=$50]$ which represents 50% of $500 that Ben has extra in the rent\nTotal cost savings = [(50+(50+50)*50)/5]= [(50+50)*50)*100/(5)*50]\nThus total cost savings is 4/(5/50)*100/(100/(5)) = $40\nThus the total cost savings of Ben's rental strategy is $40\n\nInput: John was driving his car on the interstate when it hit a big piece of ice that flew off of the bumper.

When asked, he simply responded that \u201cIf I can hit a tree on I-40 and be OK, anyone can\u2019t go wrong with a little rubber band!\u201d\nOutput: John did not buy a device that prevents the car from hitting something that is not part of the road. Instead he just drives on with his car hitting things.\nThus total cost savings = [(100+50)*100/(5/50)*50)*50]$\nThus total cost savings of John's rental strategy is $100\n\nInput: Two teams are", "answer": "A: prison"}

Electricity:25/40 = 1/20.  Water:25/50 = 45.  Thus, the total for electricity and gas, are $55.25 and $80.25 per month respectively.  Thus, the average weekly electric bill is $45 and $60 per month.  However, gas costs $27.50 per month, so the average per week gas bill will be $20.  Thus, the overall total is $125 * 30= $150\nThus, the total monthly gas bill is $130 for total consumption of $225.50 per month.  Thus, the monthly electricity bill is $60 and the per week electricity bill is $5.\nThus, $150 per month is consumed while $245.50 is spent on electricity and $10.90 is spent on gas.

So Mark\u2019s pay is $60. And in 40hrs, Mark\u2019s earned $45. This is $30 each plus $70 for 40hrs + $105 for 40hrs. So Mark\u2018s net pay after the broker earns $5 and pays him $35 is $105.\nSo this is $65 per hour and it would take Mark 40hrs to earn $500\nNow in his own life Mark\u2019s net pay is $105 + $20 = $135. And in 40hls, Mark\u2018s earned $135. This is $40 each plus $105 for 40hls. So Mark\u2019d net pay is $35 per hour and it would be $35 per hour.\nSo this is less than 35 per hour. So Mark\u2018d net pay is $29 per hour and it would only take him 28hls to earn $500.\nSo Mark\u2019s net wage after his money is taken out of the brokerage firm is $26 per hour and it would cost him 28hls to break even. So Mark\u2018\u2019s net wage at the brokerage firm is $29 per hour. And Mark\u2019d actually earn $29 per hour at the brokerage firm. Thus $25 plus $23\n= $32\n= $64\nSo Mark\u2019d net wage at the brokerage is $34 per hour and he\u2019d earn $35 per hour in the rest of the year. Thus $25 plus\n= $37\nand his net pay is $54 per hour. Thus he\u2019d earn about $55 per hour in the rest fo the year.\n\nInput:Jason needs his horse to reach the top of the mountain.

{"text": "It is best to use the following resources to prepare your children for school:\nA.  The best thing to do is to ask children to list out what is important for them before reading the question.  This helps them be able to focus and remember what is important.  For example, one child may say something like, \"I like to read books,\" while another may say, \"I like to study the English language,\" \"I love to use words to help people.\"\nB.  Instead of reading the question aloud, use a picture.  This gives children the visual representation of how the answer should look like.  For example, a picture of a large dog eating a small hamburger provides a visual image of what would happen if they tried to eat a hamburger -- a dog eating through a hamburger that is only partially eaten and with a big bite out of it.  Pictures also work well to prompt them to think outside the box so they can be innovative in the writing assignment.\nC.  Instead of reading students' answers after the task is complete, give them the opportunity to look at the answers as they work through the homework:  After students have completed their response, tell them to re-read their own questions to find out why they said one thing when in the reading they might have meant another.  This enables them to use the process of re-reading to identify any ambiguities and see if answers could have been different.\nD.  Have kids write their answers on index cards and then have them read their answers aloud.  If they use an index card, this allows them to be more creative and creative while being able to compare and contrast answers.  If they use a book, this allows them to focus their thinking inside the book rather than on the outside of the book.\nE.  Instead of giving the answer in a single page, have the students use several pages to write their answer.  This should help them be able to think for themselves rather than simply memorize what they read.\nF.  Instead of giving a lot of choice, give students one choice.  This helps them to think about what they did wrong and what they need to do in order to reach their answer.  For example, give them one choice to change all of the \"0's\" to \"1's\" to make a 0.  Have them draw it out on their index cards.\nThe final answer is 300\n\nInput: It is a great holiday for the holiday", "answer": "B: patience"}

Therefore 15*15=<<15*15=135>>135 passengers.\n15*135= <<15*135=60>>60 passengers.\nFrom the total length of one car, 60/15 show 50 passengers.\nIf you have 20 passengers, the total number on average is 50-20*20 =<<50-20*20=/80>>80 passengers.\nSo 20 + 30 = <<30+30=130>>130 passengers\nIf you have 24 passengers, the total number is 120- 120*20 =<<120-120*20=<<95-95*20=/45>>45 passengers.\nThus, 20 + 30+30 = <<20+30+30=360>>360 passengers.\nSo the final count is 360.\n\nInput:\nInput:\nInput 1 :\n1: The car-renting agency charges $30/daily for a car, or it is $190 for each week for a car that lasts 1-3 days.\nInput 2 :\n2:\nInput 3 :\n3:\nInput 4 :\n4:\nInput 5 :\n5:\nInput 6 :\n6:\nInput 7 :\n7:\nInput 8 :\n8:\nOutput:\n10 (10/90)\n20 (20/90)\n60 (60/90)\n160 (160/90)\n320 (320/90)\n600 (600/90)\n1000 (1000/90)\n1350 (1350/90)\n1450 (1450/90)\n2000 (2000/90)\n3000 (3000/90)\n3100 (3100/90)\n5100 (5100/90)\n6050 (6050/90)\n6200 (6200/90)\n7200 (7200/90)\n10000 (10000/90)\n9100 (", "answer": "C: bakery"}

They are $1000 for the set of 5 bullets.\nOutput: The total cost is $1000\nThe actual cost ($500) is only 60% of what the collector paid ($500).  That means that the museum is only 50% responsible for the maintenance of their bullet collection ($500).\nSo the final answer, assuming you use a 10% discount, is $500 = <<500+100=$2500>>2500 dollars\nIf the museum takes only a 20% discount, they will not make any money ($5000).

How much power does the power company get from the power plant?\nOutput: Each year, the power company gets $0.10 per kWh and this means that each year the $0.10 has to come from the same amount of power sold that year.\nThus $0.15 = $0.015\nFrom this it follows: $0.15*(0.10/1,000)= $0.015\nThus $0.015/0.10 = $45\nSo the final answer to the following question is $45\nFrom the power company getting $0.01 per KWh, they have to have at least 15 KWh to provide power to all of America.\nFrom this it follows that when you multiply the $45 by 15 kWh, what is the amount of energy the power company gets in the year that they supply power to all of America?\nOutput: A: 35 kWh A: 35 KWs E: 39 kWh\n\nInput: Jane and Tom are driving their car from the hotel to the ferry in the morning.

What is the price that you have to pay for that transaction?\nOutput: You have to pay 10 cents per transaction.\nBut then what is the price that you need to pay to have an account when you rent the teller machine?\nInput: You have to pay a minimum of $100.00 for each transaction.\nOutput: The total transaction charges are $100.00\nSo your total transaction charges for the last 2 transactions will be $100.00 = <<100.00/2>>100.00\nThus x = $100.00 + $100.00 / 2 = $200.00\nSo the original total transaction charges are $200.00 = <<200.00/2>>200.00\nSo you have to spend $200.00 when you rent the machine.\nSo the final price is $200.00, which is greater than x, and is therefore greater than x+200.00.\nThe sales price is $200.20.  From this you can calculate the maximum sales price of the above scenario.\n2 * 200 = 486.80\nFrom this you can find that the maximum sales price is $486.80 = <<486.80/2>>486.80\nFrom this the total sales price is $246.80 = <<246.80/2>>246.80\nSo you have to pay $246.80.\nSo the final total price is = = = = = =\n\nInput:What is the length of five letters of the English language in English?\nOutput: Five letters of the English language equals 24 letters (24*12=60)\nFour letters of the English language equal 24 letters (24*19=57)\nOne", "answer": "D: chess board"}

Let\u2019s do some thinking to figure out the possible answers to this question.\nOutput: Player A will draw the first card to discard. Player B will draw the second card to discard. Player C will draw a card.\nThus Player A will draw a card that discards the card that was in the top of the deck.\nThen Player C will draw another card and will draw yet another card which will discard a card from the bottom, thus the whole deck.\nThus Player A still draws the card in the top of the pile.\nThus Player C still draws a card.\nThus player D still draws two cards.\nThus player E still draws the third card to discard and will draw a card that will discard a card from below the top 2 cards.\nThus player F draws the fourth card to discard and will discard a card in the last card that has come down to the bottom 5 cards.\nThus player H draws the fifth card to discard and draws a card from the bottom card that has come to the bottom 3 cards. Thus player I will draw a card from behind the top 3 cards and will draw a card from the bottom 2 card and player j will draw a card from below the bottom 1 card.\nThus player k will draw the sixth card to discard and draw a card from the last card that has just come back up to the bottom 4 cards. Thus player k will draw a card. And player l draws a card to discard and draws another card from the bottom 2 cards.\n Thus player m draws the seventh card to discard in order to draw a card from the top card, thus player n rolls 4 cards.\nThus player p draws the eighth card to discard and draws the card below so that the top card remains in the top 7 cards.\nThus player r draws the ninth card to discard to draw a card under the last card. Thus player q draws the 10th card to discard, since player l drew a card from below to draw another card. Thus player r will draw the 11th card to discard. Thus player s draws the 12th card to discard for draw a card from under the last card, also player s draws the 13th card to discard.

Something must have become winded. How is it changed?\nOutput: One winded tree is a different thing. It becomes winded if the wind blows for more than 3 minutes. If the tree will not break, a second winded tree will happen.\nThus, if it takes 3 minutes to blow the tree, something is winded.\nTo make matters worse, if one tree is winded, there is no way to stop the wind. At this point, the wind is stronger than a winded tree and there is no way to make it stop.\nSo, when the wind blows, the following things happen:\n1: Leaves are bent;\n2: Trees break\n3: Rivers and lakes are swollen and more water flows into the lakes;\n4: Mountains move slightly towards the ground;\n5: Mountains become slightly lower\nSo when a tree is bent and is bent too far, then the tree will move slightly and the next wind makes the tree move further.\nThus, when something is bent, it does not change.\nThe following things are not bent:\n1. Animals that are not bent;\n2. Roads;\n3. Rivers\nSo, when something turns into winded even a slight change means that the wind is so strong that things are turned into winded.\nSo the following 3 things are not changed.\n1.

He sees the sea constantly coming up to his roof.  Everytime it rains a storm comes his way.  What are the best strategies he can think of to save his roof from a serious accident?\nOutput: The most effective strategy is to leave the house.\nJohn's house was built in the 1800's and is on the bluff at the end of a main road.  This road winds it's way up the mountain through the valley and on to a beach.  The main road climbs over the mountain and down into another valley where John lives.  The valley is full of sand and the road is steep.  This gives the road a strong lateral force and causes it to bounce up and down on the sand causing it to roll and topple.  This causes mud to settle on top of the top of the house.  To avoid the mud falling onto the roof and causing a serious accident, John must get out of the way of the rain and drive down the mountain in his car to the beach.  Since his house is built on a bluff, he doesn't have to worry about his roof being damaged in a hurricane because the wind always comes from the North.  In the winter storms, the snow and ice can fly south where it can be more severe than a hurricane.  So John must get out of his house and drive down to the beach.  A hurricane that is coming from the East, West, or South will not be as strong as the storm coming from the North.\nThe beach is only 200 yards from the road so John can drive his car to the beach and take a ride on the boardwalk or even the pier.  This makes it less risky to drive to the beach than driving to the house because the sand will make his car hard to drive through.\nThus it is safer to drive to the beach and take the ride than to drive to the beach alone because of the stronger lateral force of the highway compared to the wave of sand from the beach.  Thus it is safer to", "answer": "B: melting"}

In the last month of Lisa\u2019s friendship with Susan, everything ceased to exist.  How can Lisa explain things to Susan?\nOutput: It is possible that they lost contact for one night or maybe a week. But there were no emails, phone calls, or texts from Susan during that time. So, Susan must have been with her family on vacation. However, the reason why she was away from her family for 6 months was due to a medical issue. She did not have access to the internet.\nSo, the reason why she stopped communicating with Lisa was not her and Lisa not being friends any longer.

If you need shoes in the future instead of buying one pair you always get only one pair because they\u2019re cheaper, so you should always buy more than one pair at a time.   If you buy more than one at a time, you\u2019d have to wait a few years until you\u2019re old enough to buy the shoes again, so you should always get one pair at a time so you\u2019ll never have to wait that long without shoes.\nOutput: You need to buy a brown pair and one pair of gray shoes because you want to wear them each week rather than the two pairs you mentioned.\nSo now the $12 pair of shoes cost $12 and the $16 pair of shoes cost $16.00.  Therefore, for a week\u2019s expenses, the $12 pair shoes cost $12.00 and $16.00 shoes cost $16.  So the final answer is $16.00\n\nInput: There are two women who have two", "answer": "C: money"}

They built a 5-storied building housing 100,000 people. They had to rent the building to foreign visitors who were doing business in the country.  The Russians sold the building to the Americans for $50 million.\nAn American businessman said: \"I would pay $450,000 for that building.\"  He visited the Russians at their request.  The Russians said, \"What are the Americans going to do with it?\"\nSo the building was sold.  Then, another group of Americans began to construct their own buildings.  When those buildings were ready, another group began to construct the Soviet building again.\nThe Soviets said, \"How are we going to pay for it all?\"  And the answer was, \"Use the money we got from selling that building to buy a more powerful bomb for the war.\"\nSo the Russians built a new building to receive visitors which is now known as the Kremlin.\nIn 1950, the United States had 4.4 million people. They lived in 30 city/county areas within a radius of 35 miles. This group of people made $1.6 billion in personal income.

Since humans eat 2+2=5 it is also necessary to consider the number of animals and the proportion of body parts eaten to get to the desired number.\nInput: 100 people are eating 50 hamburgers and 100 hamburgers are eaten each day.  They are eating the hamburgers 3 hours apart every day.  10 hamburgers are eaten during lunch.  10 hamburgets are eaten during dinner.  Therefore, the number of hamburgers eaten in these 3 meals is 50 * 3 * 2 = 110 hamburgers per day.  What is the percentage of body parts eaten to meet the 110 hamburgers per meal?\nOutput: The number of hamburgers in these 3 meals is 120 hamburgers or 110% of the total number of hamburgers.\nIn this example, the food served as hamburgers was 100 hamburgers. So the total number of hamburger eaten was 60 hamburgers or 60*3 = 120 hamburgers in the first 2 meals and 60 hamburgers per meal in the last 2 meals.\nSo the final question is 120 hamburgers*70 hamburgers*60 hamburgers = 240 hamburgers per meal\nSo 120 hamburgers = 240/60 = 1072 hamburgers per meal.\nSo the final number of hamburgers is 1072 hamburgers/30 hamburgers/600 hamburgers/300 hamburgers = 1076 hamburgers = 1256 hamburgers per day\n\nInput:When you go to the doctor\u2019s office, did the doctor tell you he has a special medicine that will make", "answer": "B: hear sounds"}

It\u2019s just too much work to mow with a hedge trimmer so he uses a high-speed vacuum cleaner. Since his pool has an average depth of about 7.5 feet, how often does he need to vacuum the pool?\nOutput: How often does Tom need to vacuum the pool is 8 times the average depth of 7.5 feet (32 times a quarter).\nWhen the pool has an average depth 1/8 the normal height of Tom, he needs to vacuum the pool 8 times every 2-1/4 months.\nIn his case, there are 2-1/4 month quarters and 1/16 (quarter times 1/8) is 1/8 time.\nThus 8/32 times 32 = 64 times a year, in two years, and therefore 64/32 = <<64/32=4>>4 times each year.\nSo 16/64 year = 4 times each year (four times per year=32 times each year).\nNow that that is out of the way, let x be average depth of Tom\u2019s pool.\nFrom here, the math is simple.\n8 x 64 = 128\nTherefore128/4 = 482\nThus =<<4832/2>>484\nSo the final answer for the pool is 482.\n\nInput: In a restaurant, the waitresses who make drinks serve all of their customers drinks in the same glass that the customer ordered their drinks in.

One parent is a janitor, one child is a janitor, and one sibling is a janitor.  The total number of people in every 4th grade and 5th grade classroom has 100 persons.\nOutput: It is assumed that each child in the 4th grade classroom has the same number of friends in the 5th grade classroom.\nTo find 100 persons in a classroom in 4th grade class, multiply the number of students in class by 50 and then divide that number by 14.  Then divide the number 50 again by 4 and divide that number 50 again by 7.  The number of persons in the 4th grade class is divided by 14 and we get 100 persons.\nFor 5th grade class, multiply 50 by 4 and divide that result in half.  Then multiply that result by 7.  Finally, divide that result by 6 or 8.  Thus the number of persons in 5th grade class is divided again by 14 and we get 200 persons.\nFor 10th grade class, multiply by 4 and divide by 7.  Thus the number 100 is divided by 7.  In total, it is assumed that classes have equal numbers of students in them.\nThus, class A is 8 rows of students while class B is 11 rows of students.\nThis gives us 100 students per row compared to 10 in each row.\nFor 12th grade course, multiply by 4 and divided by 7..

So if the homeowner wants to sell the house at the original price, what would the appraiser have to say that would convince her that the price of the property is an error?\nOutput: As always there is much to consider, such as market conditions, current market values, historical market values, etc.\nSo the appraiser was actually wrong.

On the first day of the marathon, she eats at breakfast for breakfast, and takes food to her body before she goes for a run.  How many calories does the woman burn in a 24 hour period?\nOutput:The average amount of energy that is burned in a day is 1000 calories. Therefore, she burns 1000 x 2+1000=1000 calories during 24 hours and in total burned during the 24 hr period.\nSo if her breakfast meal is 1000 calories and she\u2019s going for a run she burns 1000/12 + 1000/24 = 1000 x 2*1000 = 1200 calories.\nSo her total burned calories through the 24 hours are 1200 x 2+1200 = 1600 calories.

Mary felt so bad that she bought the garage owner another beer and gave him $20.  She gave him $20 after he was done with his beer so he could pay down his mortgage.

The total cost per acre of the produce produced is $300.  The total cost of the seedlings is 7500 and it will take 5 years to reach harvest (4.5 months).\nOutput: The cost of the crop is $500, but the cost of the seedlings per acre is $320.  Thus for the crop to be profitable, the total cost per acre is $240/1000 = $20 / 1000\nHowever, we know that the price per acre will not be greater than $240/1000 or the seedlings are too expensive because the total cost to produce the crop is just $500.  Thus the total cost per acre with seedlings will be: $80/1000 = $15 / 1000\nTherefore, with seedlings, the total cost per crop will be $80 / 100 = $15 / 100 = $150/ $150 = 150/150.  It will take 15 years to get to harvest; in 4 years, the total cost is $150 / 150 = $150/150, so $150/150 = 150/150 = $150/150/150\nIn 4 years, the total profit will be: $225/150 = $25/ 150 = $125/150 = $100/150 = $125 / 150 = $100/150\nSo in 4 years, you can buy half the cost crops with the seedlings.\nTotal produce = $225 / $450\nPer acre = $80\nPer crop = $160 / $240\nSo per acre, $80/30 = $40/ $90\nThus you can buy half the crop by buying seeds and the other half with the seedlings. However, you can get 100% of crops by paying cash.\nFinal Result: You can buy half of the crop with cash and 50% with the seedlings", "answer": "A: tardiness"}

He is told that he has 15 minutes to stand still.  As police cars go, a car is classified as having a speed of 40mph or less.  How fast is that car?\nOutput: As police cars go, the speed is 40mph plus 5 mph.\nThus, 10mph = = 45m.\nThus, the speed of that car is 45+5=90 m/min. The car is only moving 15 foot-yards per minute.\nThus, the car is moving at a rate of 1 m/min.\nThus, the total speed is 90m * 0.05 = ~90m / 0.05 = ~160m per hour\nSo the maximum speed of that car is 160m / 0.05 / *0.05 = ~160 m / h = ~220 m per hour\nSo the final answer would be 220 / 0.05 = 60m / h\n\nInput: Jason bought a convertible.

{"text": "A\nSo a guitar player is a musician/acute musician + arthritis\n\nInput: This is the first of three games consisting of two teams of five people each which compete against each other to create a new object over this time period.  Each person plays with one ball (or the ball with no \u201cball\u201d) and is forced to play for as long as they can before the other team scores an actual goal.  The players are given a goal at one end of the field that they must create before they score an actual goal.  At the other end of the field, there are seven balls that players must score against before they get a goal.  If they achieve success, they get an advantage until they score an actual goal and lose again.  This goes on until a goal is scored or until four goals have been scored, whichever comes first.  The rules of this game are as follows:\n1.  Each player has to score a goal for their team before they can move to the next team.\n2.  Once a player scores a goal, the next player on the other team must score a goal to become a team member.\n3.  If both teams on the field score a goal, they score an identical number of goals called \u201cpoints\u201d.\n4.  If a player scores five or more goals, they are awarded \u201ctrophies\u201d and \u201cpoints\u201d that are equally weighted.\n5.  If a ball is moved without a score, it is returned to the ball-thrower, who must score a goal to attempt to score a third goal.\n6.  Players on each team must compete against one another to score the most goals over a time period. (See below for game rules.)\n7.

What was the total amount of baking that was done?\nOutput: The entire baking time was 5+1+12-2 = <<5+1+6=12>>12\nSo it is reasonable to assume that there were 5 brownies baked per person, total = 5.5 brownies baked in 5+12-2 days = |5+1+6+12|12.  Because Mary gave 5 brownies to each guest, the total total number of brownies baked in 5 days of 2+1+1 = 10.  So there were 10+10=20 brownies baked in 5 plus 12 days.  A total of 20+20=60 brownies were baked in 5 plus 12\nSo the final answer was 60\n\nInput: An individual lives on a farm. He has a machine shop.

They want to buy a house before this time comes around. What would be the fair amount of equity in each of their homes?\nOutput: One way to look at that is if Jane and Jack bought each the house on their own, it would be fair when compared to how much equity the husband already has in the property. If Jane and Jack bought the house together, that would be double.\nThe couple, however, would not be able to afford to buy the home together unless the husband gets at least a 50% commission. The husband would have 50% equity while Jane would have 30% equity.\nSo while the husband and Jane would not be able to take a vacation together again, it would be fair for them to at least have enough equity in their individual homes to take a vacation together in the future.\nThis may not be the correct way of doing the valuation of the property, especially taking all of the family into consideration.\n\nInput: A friend", "answer": "D: republican party"}

Let the dog go to the side of the road and the distance the dog will have to walk there will be exactly 0.05 mile.\nHowever, if he is walking on the side of a building with 6.5 feet high cement steps that is twice the distance the dog will walk.\nSo if there is a 5.5 feet high concrete step the dog will have to pull in his steps (1.25 * 1.5 = <<5.5 steps>>5 paces) = 5.5 paces x 5.5 feet = <<5.5/5.5=10\u00d710=5 inches.\nSo if the dog will be walking on concrete in the middle of a building, he'll have to pull in 10*10= <<10\u00d710=26\u00d726=66.>>66 inches.\nThus on the street the dog will have to cover 26*10= <<26\u00d726=1.5 times >>>1.5^12 = <<26\u00d726=11 times >>>11 times\nSo he'll have to go around the building and 1.5 times will be enough (11/26) so the final answer is 11\n\nInput:  A friend of Mark's was trying to buy a house.

After several blocks he had just enough gas for 45 minutes, so he walked 20 feet back to his car, got 2 gallons of gas, and went back to his car.  How far a walk is he from the gas station?\nOutput: The answer depends on the weather conditions.\nIn the extreme cold, the walk would be very short.  The walk is about 16 feet.\nIn the snow, the walk would be much longer because the snow would cover your feet.  the walk is about 36 feet.\nIn the rain, the walk would be difficult and dangerous because you would have to be careful where you stepped.  The walk is 44 feet.\nSo the final distance is 44 feet.\n\nInput: In a large group all walking at the same pace at a certain speed, how many will walk in order to block out noise the other person hears?\nOutput: The group walk of 11 people will prevent an annoying \u201cshhh\u201d noise from becoming more annoying.

He is willing to pay back $1000 at a time or he will be a month late with the payment. Will his creditors be willing to forgive $1000 at a time? This is the second time he has to ask permission to take out $1000.\nOutput: He can take out 12 month loans at a time and is willing to be a month late with payments. He can also get six month loans at a time; if he gets the 6 months, he will be at risk of being charged interest by his bank because he is not paying on time and his monthly loan payments are $2,400.\nSo he will pay off 6 months of the $2000 loan, $2,400, at a cost of $1600 at a time or $200.00 a month. So, his monthly loan is only $600.00.\nThus, his monthly loan payment will be $600.00. So $600.00 times $960.00 x 60 weeks = $12,200.00.\nThus $200.00 a months payments divided by $960.00 x 12 = $1600.00.\nSo the final output is $1600\n\nInput:The new office building that the business was in recently had a huge leak, and it caused $18,300 to be spent to repair the building.

Since it has a toilet, he will have trouble keeping track of how much he uses it during that 10 days. In particular, he will be worried about not being able to flush the toilet at certain times.  To make a more accurate report from the toilet, he needs a way to keep track of how much he used each time.\nOutput: Jason will use his toilet every 9 or 10 hours. Thus, he will have a 10-day toilet report, in writing.\nHe will use a separate form to calculate how many poos he peed. He can write one entry for each time he used the toilet. He will write as much on his paper report as he needs to write about each period he had to go to the toilet.\nThus, 10/9 x 10 is 30 days x 30 = 300 poo entries.\nIt will take 150 poo entries and 150 poo forms = 300 poo-reports per day.\nSo, for one day alone there will be 6 poo-reports.\nThus, the resulting poo reports will have 6 entries:\n6 <<6>>>>4.5 = <<6|4.5=12>>12\nor\n6 <<6=20>>20 x 6\n= <<20|6+6=36>>36 poo entries\nSo the final answer will be 36\n\nInput: Mary has a large family with 5 grandchildren.

We will need a second horse with two legs.\n\nInput: If all the horses in a barn ate the feed in a jar they wouldn't run out of hay.  What would happen if all the horses had one bucket and the bucket was full?\nOutput: It will be impossible for all the horses to eat the same amount of hay if they all have the same amount of space.\nHorses need to have space for their heads.\nTherefore, the answer is (1 + 1/(2*1/3)) * 1 is equal to (2 + 2/(2*1/4))*1\nSo (2 + 2/(1/4*2)) = 2/3.  The correct answer is (1 + (2 + 2/(0/2))*1).  This answer can be used for more than one question.\nUse it to find the answer to other questions.\nExample: If you asked all of the horses in the barn to eat the same amount (3/4\" of hay each) of hay, what would happen if all the barns contained horses with only one leg and then they all had to eat the hay in buckets.\nOutput: You will find that no amount of hay can feed them all and then you will need to give them all buckets of hay.\n\nInput:A man wants to build a barn with an enclosed fence around it.

{"text": "James loved the stars because they lit up the night sky which was the constellations and the stars which represented the constellations.\nSo if he was looking up at the stars and he noticed that a star appeared, he decided that it was the constellation Orion.  Since there were four constellations that he saw in the night sky, including Orion, he was very familiar with the constellations.  Since he already knew about the constellations, then the star would be the constellation that represented Orion in the constellation Orion\u2019s Brightness.\nIf he was looking at the stars through the ground, then there are two constellations that James noticed.  They were: Scorpius A and Pallas.  Since these two constellations were the constellations that represented the Scorpius and Pallas, then James decided that the constellations represented the scorpions and the parrots.  Since the constellations were Scorpius and Pallas and since James already knew both constellations, there would be no constellations that represented those two constellations.\nIf he was on a mountaintop and was looking up at the sky, then he could see two different constellations.  He saw a constellation called Canis Major that represented the wolf and he saw another constellation called Canis Minor that represented the dog.  Since the constellation Canis Major was the dog, while the constellation Pallas represented the scorpions, James decided that the star was the scorpion.\nIf he came down to a campfire and was looking at the stars and he saw a star, then he knew that it was the constellations that stood out in the sky above the campfire.  Since the constelations represented them, he also knew that they represented the stars.  Since he knew about the constellators and the stars, he knew that they would be the constellations represented.  Since he already knows the constellators and knows about the stars, then there would be no constellation for him to see in the sky above the fire.\nThus, James could see two constellations in the sky, because the constellations represented both the stars and the constellations.

The wife has two sons the boyfriend has one daughter. When they buy the house, what does the wife take into the house and who takes out?\nOutput: The wife carries everything in the house and the boyfriend pays for nothing in the house.\nThus, since the wife carries everything into the house, she has a positive and the boyfriend has a negative.\nOf course, when they move into the house their relationship gets negative because he has the less valuable possessions and she has the more valuable possessions.\nIf they both had negative things in each home and neither of them had positive in each home they would both have negative relationships in the home.\nAnd if they both had positive things in each home and both of them had negative in each home they would have positive relationships in the home.

Everybody else is women who all work at the same company.  The boss has just ordered men\u2019s shirts and no women.  The women get told that they all have to buy different shirts but the new dress shirts cost $20 each instead of the $5 that the men pay.  They are upset but some of the women have never heard of budget so they want to buy their own shirts.  The boss tries to explain that they can all buy their own shirts but one of them might not be able to, and they can\u2019t tell which one isn\u2019t wearing the right shirt unless she tells them.  What\u2019s the best solution?\nOutput:\nEach of the women should buy all of their own shirts.  They will want to give each other gifts.\nBudget shirts: 1\nMen\u2019s shirts: 4\nMen\u2019s dress shirts: 4\nWomen\u2019s shirts: 5\nEach woman should receive $20 toward each of the budget shirts.\nSo each woman should buy a shirt = $20, and each woman should receive $20 in her present for a total of $120.\nSo each woman will receive $120 in a gift = $$120 / 4 = $120.00\nThus each woman will receive $60 dollars.\nSo the final solution in $$$$\nSo the final solution is $60\n\ninput:\nThe population in an Indian reservation in Oklahoma is 1.6 million.

It was late and it was easy for them to get lost.  They passed other cars and began looking for a map.  A few cars ahead was a Starbucks coffee shop.  They took a left turn at the Starbucks entrance and parked next to a Starbucks coffee machine.  They proceeded to order a large cup of caffeine for themselves and another for their new car.  They started to pull out.\n\n When the coffee machine stopped pumping, they noticed that their car had slid forward one row of cars.

The male children need the same number of clothes as the female children because each of the male children wears different clothes each day.  The clothing for each child is in 2 separate closets. The mother knows how many clothes each child has, since the mother is the only one who looks at her son\u2019s clothing.  She takes out the 6 shirts she has ready to go and throws them all in one of the closets.  Is it correct to say that the closet has 6 rows of clothes and no clothes in between the rows?\nOutput: The clothes are in rows and the mother doesn\u2019t know how many rows are in the closet because she doesn\u2019t know the number of rows.\nBut the clothes are in rows, which means that it doesn\u2019t matter which closet she has the clothing in, that is all she needs to know, and she only needs to know the number of rows that are in the closet, in her case 6.\nSo we have 2+6=<<3+6=12>>12 and 0.6 * 12 + 0.6 * 12 = <<12x6=<<12x6=20>>20 clothes.\nSo the final answered is 20\n\nInput: A group of college professors had an informal game of trivia: the professor asked each of his students questions so that his students did not know how much he knew about them or their interests; no one wanted their names on the quiz and those that did wanted to be anonymous.

He found that it was the fan that was broken.  He replaced the fan and turned it on for a while and then left it running in the middle of the day.  How long does it takes for the air conditioner to heat up?\nOutput: It takes 4 hours to heat up.  The unit only takes 1 hour to cool down.\nSince the unit only lasts 1 hour, 4 hours x 1 hour = 4 hours x 3 hours = 12 hours\nSo after 4 hours the air conditioner can cool down a total of 12 hours and 36 minutes = 48 hours.\nSo the final question is 48 (4x1.3)\n\nInput: Three police officers, two armed with a taser and a baton, were looking for a suspect in an armed robbery that happened 2 days earlier. They got the suspect, but the suspect escaped. They chased him away and his girlfriend who is a friend of the suspect shot him twice in the back. He died. How did the suspect die?\nOutput: The suspect died from a gunshot wound to the back\nSince the suspect is only 5\u20193\u201d tall, the baton would barely penetrate his skin. Therefore, 2 shots fired by the suspect would have killed the suspect.\nSo if the suspect is 5\u20193\u2019\u2019, his body mass, at 5\u20193\u201c, is 200 lbs.  A taser would only do about 40 mph or 2.25 mph so a total of 40 mph would have been needed to kill the suspect.\nThus, since 10 mph is the average speed of the baton, 14 mph x 2 x 40 mph = 48 mph.  So 1 x 14 x 2 x 40 = 72 mph\nSo for that same 12 hours, 48 x 72 x 2.25 = 72 hours x 72 hours = 24-hours\nThus 24-hours x 72 hours = 48-hours x 72-hours = 72-hours\nSo the final answer that is 48\n\nInput: The three police officers were in a patrol car.

She is charging $15 for a 10 minute lesson, or $200 for 15-20 minute lessons.  She is charging 60% of the retail cost for her class, so her class will cost her $100.00.  What percentage of the retail cost is charged by an average student?\nOutput: Students will pay $150 per lesson, leaving $100 for her classes.\nThis leaves a loss of $50.00\nMultiply $50.00/15-20, you get $150 per month, and divide by 30-month classes for $150/month.\nMultiply this by 15 months, you get $600 per month, or $1,000 per year.\nThus, she made $200 per month, or $300 per year\nThis means\n60% of the retail price is charged by an average class\nThus, only $600 of the retail cost of teaching the class will go to Melissa (including her equipment, transportation, and supplies)\nThus, she made only $200, not $300,\nThis means $600\n\nInput:  There are 3 computers at the school so they must replace each computer every 6 months.

How many presents will she get?\nOutput: 9 presents are given to Mary's 9-year-old and 5 presents are given to the 5-year-old.\nSince each of her children has a baby brother and a baby sister, it is important that she give them all the same present.\nThus, if Mary is able to buy 9 presents, she will have 4 presents left over for her 3-year-old.  If Mary can buy only 5 presents, she will need to buy 4 and 1 for her 3-year old.\nThus the final answer is 50\n\nInput:John is going back to the dentist tomorrow.

He purchases two cycling helmets for $40 each, leaving $50.00 cash at his house.  So far it adds up to $160.00 in total.\nThus if 5 helmets are purchased for him, he will need to purchase 4 more for $40 each.  Now he will also have to buy a total of 7 bicycles for a grand total of $80 cash.  Since he only needs to purchase 4 more presents for Mary, she will need to be gifted a total of 15 bicycles.\nThus the final value of John buying 5 bicycles is a grand total of $150 cash ($40 for the helmets and $60 for the bicycles in addition to $100 cash for the presents for Mary).\nThus the final", "answer": "C: naked"}

After measuring each, John calculates both of the variables that are needed.  What is the ratio of the two?\nOutput: John found that his ball of yarn would need a total of 6 ounces, or 2 lbs., and his string would require 12 lbs., or 6 lbs.  This equals 10:16, where 10 is needed for his launch.\nThus John's Launch=<<10*6+12*8=33>>33 pounds of yarn.\nIncluding an 8 lb. bag of string, his Launch=<<2*33+12*12*6=50>>50 pounds of yarn.\nSo John now has 49 pounds of yarn for his launch.

The problem is for Mark to remove 50% of the water that is in a reservoir that is 10 feet high, with a 100 degree Fahrenheit water temperature.  Mark determines what the time the reservoir will have to reach a temperature of 70 degrees so as to be usable.  Mark determines how long it will take to remove the water from that reservoir.  How does Mark factor in the flow rate?\nOutput: Let x be the temperature of the reservoir at a 70 degree time mark and let f=50% of the total water in the reservoir.  Suppose a 1 million gallon water tank filled at 10% capacity and has water at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  When f reaches 50%, the temperature of the reservoir reaches 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  Thus 1 million gallons x 70 degrees = 16,500 gallons.  Therefore 16,500 gallons needs to be removed per hour.  Let x=70F and x=60 degrees.  Therefore 1% x 60+40 = 10% must be removed to fill the tank.\nThus in this case 20% per hour would be 1,200 gallons per hour that was removed.\nSo this implies that 50% x 70 is the minimum to have the reservoir usable at 70 degrees, so 4,400 gallons per hour were removed.  Thus this implies that if x=70F and f=50%, only 15,500 gallons per hour of water was removed.  Thus x=70F and ff=1,600 gallons per hour were removed in this case.\nTherefore the time to get rid of all the water in the reservoir to be usable for the day is 14 hours after f reaches 50%.  This implies that once f=50%, the time to have a reservoir usable at 70 degrees was 70 hours.  Given these assumptions, 6 hours from", "answer": "B: table"}

Therefore:\nEach ball cost $10\nThus the total cost of the two balls (5*2=<<5+2=10>>10) is $15\nAlice has 5 balls for her sons at a combined total price of $45\nSo the final answer to the questions is $45\n\nInput: The family has a two bedroom house and an addition. The family is renting the house for the winter. In the winter months, the family spends $180 per month on electricity to heat the house. If every night at 8:30 PM the power is turned off, how many nights must the family sleep on cold air?\nOutput: The family has lost the power several times. Each time the power is turned off is a night they need to pay for to heat the house.\nThus a total of 6 nights per winter = 6 x 9 = 156 nights of heating on cold floor beds.\nSo the final result of the questions is 156 nights of $180 per month.\nSo the total electricity bill is $390.00 per year.\nSo the total cost of electricity is $390.00 / 78 * 78 = $390.00\nThus, $390.00 x 78 = $$$$\nSo the final amount is $$$$\n\nInput: Charles and his daughters are visiting his sister, Mary Beth, and her son, David.

Bob plans to make 75 gallons of liquid manure each year in order for the corn to grow.\nInput: 1,000 lbs of manure = 15,000 gal.\nOutput: 750 gal = 25,000 gal in liquid manure. Thus, the total cost of liquid manure is 600 gal = 25,000 times 750 = 25,000\nSo the final answer depends on how much liquid manure Bob uses from that area. If he keeps using 600 gal of liquid manure for the entire 5 acres, then the final answer is 600. If he uses 600 gal for the first 20 acres, then the final number is 800. If he uses 800 gal for the second 20 acres, then the total cost is 1100. So the total cost is 1100/7 = 600\nSo the final answer cannot be 600 and 1200\nThus, the final answer can be as follows\n\nInput:  1,000 lbs of corn = 10,000 gal\nOutput: 750 gal  = 25,000 gal\n\nInput: If it costs $50 to fill a two-wheel vehicle, how much would a vehicle cost to fill with 10 gallons of gas?

Ban suggests that an increased number of AIDS programs worldwide will lead to a decline in new cases by 2015. To make this prediction possible, Ban says that a global reduction in the HIV/AIDS death rate will be needed by 2015 in the order of 5,000 cases per day. How will Ban\u2019s prediction contribute to reducing AIDS cases worldwide?\nOutput: In order to reduce the number of AIDS cases, Ban Ki-moon hopes for a global reduction in the rate of new cases by 2015 by 5,000 cases per dia.  That is roughly 1/50th of the number of HIV/AIDS cases in the world.\nSince new cases are expected to decrease in the world, the number of lives saved is the same since 50,000 fewer people are dying each year.\nThus, Ban predicts that by 2015 there will be fewer AIDS cases and therefore fewer deaths due to HIV/AIDS around the world.\nSo the final question is how many deaths will be saved by 2015 due to AIDS?\n\nInput: What percentage of new cases of AIDS have occurred in the United States over the past 12 years?

How many hours does she need to work in order to divide this extra money up?\nOutput: Let\u2019s say Melissa earns $800 per month from selling shoes.  So the extra money that she pays her uncle on a month basis will take $800 = $800 * 12 = $1600\nSo if we say Melissa earns $800 at her job then $1600 / 12 month = $240/12 month\nThen we determine that Melissa has $240 left over after paying her uncle.\nSo she needs to divide up $240 for transportation expenses + $240 for the food her uncle will need each month + $60 for the gas her uncle will need each time he leaves this week.\nEnter $60 as a weekly total ($360/6-months).\nEnter the gas for $60 as an annual total ($3636/6-months).  Then multiply the annual cost of gas by 60 = $3636/6 = $360\nTherefore, it will take her = 60/3636 = $3636/180 = 120 hours a month to divide up the money.\nSo she will only need 120 hours in order to divide the money up for the transportation, food, and expenses.\nThus it is 120 hours x 120 hours = 360 hrs in 5 weeks\nSo the current workday is 40 hr.\nSo the final total is 360 hrs x 40 hours = 60 hours = $360\n\nInput: A storm has blown through a region of southern Louisiana.

Therefore the Man and Wife have $980/month available to them to pay some of their expenses.\nTherefore the Man and Wife have a budget of $980 / 0.80 = $980 / 0.8 = <<980 / 0.8=10>>10.\nThey will have $1068 left after expenses for their first year of marriage.\nHowever, it\u2019s a good idea to make extra savings for emergencies, so that should be okay.\nSo the final budget is $980 / 10 = <<980/10=100>>100\nSo the final answer for this situation is 100\n\nInput: Jim had three beers at the bar after work.

Every month he pays $300 to own the car.  How much would it cost to insure the car?\nOutput: John does not need insurance for the car.\nHe does however use the insurance to pay for gas and other purchases.  The monthly car insurance payment of 300$ is therefore the amount that John needs to pay to have the car insured.\nGiven the monthly payments for the car, John needs to pay 100$.\nJohn needs to pay 100 to insure the car.  Therefore, the additional 100$ is required from John to insure the car.\nSo John needs to be careful about spending and saving and plan his budget carefully for an income to afford the added amount.\nThus John needs to learn from his mistake and learn how to make smarter decisions in saving and budgeting.

Other customers might say \"great value\" if they were ordered a main meal instead, or \"good deal\" if he tried to split the bill into multiple meals.  A charge of 15% on an evening's snack would be the lowest price for food the restaurant offered; the \"great value\" or \"good deal\" would be charging a full price of $20, and the 15% on an evening snack would be the highest price the restaurant would charge for food.  A charge of 10% on an evening snack, or 50% on a main meal would be the highest price for food the restaurant could charge.  For example, at the restaurant, \"the restaurant sells an appetizer for $7.50 and a main course for $12.00.  The main course is salmon and there is a vegetarian option.\"  The menu could be: appetizer, $7.50 main dish, $12.00 vegetarian.  The food that was purchased for the appetizer in the $7.50 main course was $8.00; the entree that was purchased for the $12.00 vegetarian was $14.00.  If Lyra bought this appetizer and put it on the $7.50 meal, the total price of $16.00 would be $21.00.  She would have charged $14.00 or $10.00 for the appetizer and $16.00 or $20.00 for the main course.  The \"cheap\" or \"great value\" price would be $20.00 for an appetizer and $8.00 or $12.00 for a main meal, while the \"great value\" would be $20.25 for an appetizer and 10.25 or $12.25 for a main course.  Both the \"cheap\" or the \"great value\" prices would be the highest.  The \"cheapskate\" or \"scrooge\" would be charging 10% on an appetizer and $20.25 on the main course.

So E is the least practical but most effective choice.  The most practical choice is to stay put and write in the rain.  But since the rain would still be the source of the problem for D and E, it is the most expensive but least effective choice.  The safest (and least costly) choice would be to take the pen to a friend\u2019s house. It is their pen and all their work is theirs. Then D and E are left to write it off as lost.\nThe most practical choice would be to go to town to have your pen repaired and a replacement pen.  But because it is raining while D is at work and A is still at home, there is no need to go to town since A has her work at home and D only has to write her work.  So instead, she decides to write her work with the other pen \u2013 and does so for a time.  Then, during the time the pen is repaired (she can still write work by hand, though she can't take notes), the pen has its ink re-filled.  Now D has her pen working, which is how she knows to go to town in the first place since the new pen has its ink already filled.

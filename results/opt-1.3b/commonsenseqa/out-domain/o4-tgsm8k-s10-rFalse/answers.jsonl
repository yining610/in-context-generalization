Your question also makes no reference to whether it is a fungus that takes advantage of photosynthesis, like D, or if it's a fungus that is in competition with photosynthesis like C... it's a question of what *percentage* of all photosynthesis could be eaten by the fungus, so how much of the photosynthesis they can take advantage of.\n3) You're correct that it's correct to say what kind of photosynthesis your example requires. It's also correct to say what kind *increase* in photosynthesis you're talking about - you can't increase photosynthesis by only growing a single plant, so you don't *have* to grow a fungus.\nMy first guess was a fungus that is in compete with photosynthesis and which eats all the photosynthesis. Your second guess would be a fungus that requires *some* photosynthesis and which is able to *take advantage* of some of that photosynthesis.\n4) I disagree with your third guess, to be honest. A fungus like D would almost certainly require more photosynthesis than something like, let's say, a bacteria.

The psychologist asked Adam to guess the size of a banana. Adam guessed 9 inches in diameter. The psychologist said that Adam could not use the numerical scale from the past because it was impossible to assess an object\u2019s exact size.  If the scale is a real factor in whether someone thinks an object is small or large, then Adam would be correct only if the scale does not exist. Assuming instead that all people have a natural sense of scale and that people are not conscious observers of their \u201cactual scale\u201d, the psychologist suggests a simple alternative. Adam may be close in size, but his guess is a fraction of an inch smaller than the bananas that are actually purchased.

Ask if there is a grocery store near this place so you can ask if they have grocery coupons for this place or that place and they can see if someone can help you. In fact, ask everyone you see about any job possibilities, any businesses that might be hiring, or any things the local area can do that would be helpful. Ask about the weather, and see what kinds of activities would be at the park when it was nice out. Then ask if there is any kind of entertainment for children or other activities for people older than you. Ask if there is any type of government office nearby, since that might be where you could get information about welfare, unemployment, and such. You'll probably want to ask any local residents if they've heard anything about the government office or job opportunities nearby.

The trainer can achieve this by adding an additional 50/50 or 20/80 to her horses points.  If the horse also has the highest point value of the pack, she should always get the winner.  Let's call the pack A.  In order to get points A she could  take the horses points in B, C, D, E,  and so on.  Let's call horse D a very talented performer.  Horse D points total should be A+B+C+D + E=E+D+E.  Horse D therefore needs to achieve the following in order to win the Kentucky Derby:  E+Horse D+Horse E must all have the highest point value  E must be the highest horse in her pack  Horse D needs the highest points for E+Horse E  The best way to earn points like horse D is to perform A-B-C and get points from E. Horse D wins the Kentucky Derby by winning the next horse. Her next horse is obviously E+Horse D. However, if horse E is the next horse then horse A must win horse B, C, and D+Horse E+Horse D must all have E+Horse E which is a very unlikely possibility.  Let's call her A+.  Horse A wins the Kentucky Derby by taking the point values of horses E-F as their respective odds. Let's call her A+F+.  Horse A must also achieve the following in order for her to win the Kentucky Derby;  F must win horse D, E must be the highest point horse in her pack, and D need to finish ahead of horse E in point value. Let's call horse E the highest card in the pack.  Her next horse is obviously D+Horse D+F+C+E. Horse D is unlikely to be higher point value than horse F. Suppose horse E finishes ahead of horse F in point value.  Horse E wins the Kentucky Derby by finishing ahead of Horse A. Horse A needs to achieve the following to  win the Kentucky Derby; 1 must win horse A, horse D, or F must race ahead of horse G. Let's call horse G the lowest points horse in her pack. Horse G does not win the Kentucky Derby by finishing in the position required by horse A. Therefore, horse A", "answer": "D: painting"}

The total number of games played in a season is 82, while the 50 minute time period is 45.  The number of games per season thus is 80 (12*45).  To calculate the total number of goals, add up the time periods.  Since 82 and 45/50 = 30 the total number of goals is 40, and 32 would be 40 (because the number of goals scored by one player is 20%).  Thus, the total number of goals in a season is 80/60 = 54 points.\n   Out of 82 games, 60 games are played in the regular season, and the remaining 40 games (9/18 x 40) are in the playoffs.  That gives you the total number of games played, 82 plus 9/18 = 84.\nNow, add up the number of games played in the regular season and playoffs: 84 - 81 = 56, and 56 - 56 = 30, which gets rid of the 30.  Now, subtract 30 from 54 to get the total number of goals this season and last season:  50 - 57 = 37.\n\ninput:John buys 2 kilograms of nuts and 2 kilograms of dried fruits at the store.

The number of chickens sold on a given day is 5.  So the average daily chicken sales were $30.  The average daily egg sales were $20.  The total gross per week was $1000.  Calculated in Dollars. Average gross per week (Weekly) - Average daily chicken/day net sales: $1375 - $1850 = $7000 + $1000 = $7200 per week.

The total daily potato sales were $0.20. The total gross per week is $800.  Calculated in dollars. Average gross per week - Average daily potato net sales: $3500 + $1200 = $6000 net sales.  The net sale was about $4000 per week = $4500 per week.  Hence the net sale was $4500 per week = $10400 per week.\nOutput #3- A - The total number of pieces of meat sold in the given month are 4.5kg.  The average daily sales are 12.5kg.

A person can be anyone that you would consider to be someone (other than the player on the other team... he doesn't count I bet). It would be interesting to calculate the number of people that played football for the US that are eligible by nationality.\n\nThe question about the amount of fuel you're supposed to have to give you 2-4 hours of flying time, is this based on your actual weight (a person who isn't overweight can run for that much time, after all), or the average weight of the people flying on that plane?\n\nWell I looked at the data and it would seem that the 2-4 hours is based on weight. If I'm overweight I will probably run less than someone who isn't. I wouldn't be surprised if overweight people had a harder time running.\nI think in most tournaments you can play until you can't run no matter what, but I may be wrong.", "answer": "E: erections"}

In the new model, the new size of the tank and, therefore, the price, depends on the size of the plane, which changes depending on its weight.\n\nSince the increase of 20% is in relation to a higher total number of flights, and given the fact that the number of flights in the league will increase, it is natural that the final cost of fuel will increase in proportion to it.\n\nIf the fuel cost would not have increased by more than 20%, the same amount of fuel would have cost a plane 100% less. The price of fuel should be as low as possible, otherwise, it would not be profitable for airlines to take the planes (in this case the \u201cplane\u201d that we are talking", "answer": "A: residential neighborhood"}

On the other hand, even if all the goals scored by all players during a game are equal, if the total number of goals is smaller than the number of goals scored by players even if all the players score the same goal, the game will be won by one of the players. Suppose that a player scores a goal in 5 minutes in the first game of 2 games and another player scores a goal in 15 minutes in the next game when their teams are tied, but if there are equal number of goals scored during two games in both games, the game will be decided by whoever scores the goal first in the second game.\n\nThe players will score goals against each other by making passes, using kicks, and shooting goals. However, they will not give assists to each other. Thus, there will be no player whose actions contribute to the goals. Each player's actions contribute to the goals in the same way that each players' actions contribute to his/her own goals during a game by his/her actions. Thus, all actions contribute equally to the goals scored by those players.\n\nIn the case of goals against, one player will receive assists from two other players after scoring a goal against each other. For example, for a goal scored by player A in the first game against player B, player A will receive two assists from player B after the score is level. Then player B's goal will be worth two goals and player A will be awarded one assist from each of them. However, the player receiving the two assists and three goals will take a double goal, and, as a result, will have a total of six goals for the game. The same will happen, except that player A will receive three assists and two goals, and player B will receive one assist. Thus, for a single goal", "answer": "D: frequent"}

For a bad idea to be a \"curse\", the bad idea must cause the person to regret it.  For instance,   If a person thinks of a bad idea and gets the first sign, that is a \"curse\".  Later on, if the person still thinks of the idea, that is also considered a  \"curse\".   The idea is then \"cursed\".  If someone says to me, \"No, this guy with the hair doesn't do anything right\", he is a  \"curse\" to my opinion  of that person. If someone has to deal with something he doesn't like, that person is a.  A \"curse\" to myself or him b.

{"text": "The answer: A.\n\nSubmissions\n\nI just finished reading The New York Times Sportswriters Guide to the Soccer World Cup, and it is a perfect book for any fan of the World Cup to read and for those of us that follow soccer in the United States to reference on paper while we read and contemplate our favorite American soccer stars.\n\nThe book starts about a year after the tournament ends, in July of 2002, but is an extremely fresh look at the tournament, focusing on just 16 of the 60 nations that made it to the tournament, and the impact from the tournament on the players there. And to get a feel for each of these nations, readers get to get to know each nation's players, and even get to get to know the world wide soccer fans and fans of those nations as well. The book is a well written, great read that is perfect as a quick reference while you sit down to watch a soccer match.\n\nIn the beginning, the writer's take on the World Cup is that it was a terrible tournament. The book also makes the point that the tournament is over and that fans should just focus on the upcoming United States versus Costa Rica match. It also makes the point that soccer is growing in the US, and that the US national team is good enough to get to the quarterfinals of the tournament. The writers of the guide even point out how hard the tournament was for the US team, and how much they learned from it.\nThe book is full of statistics that would make soccer fans and Americans alike very thankful for the team that represented our country. It also has a great section on the tournament that gives a good idea of what happened both in the tournament and throughout the world.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nTommy Thompson is a soccer fan that lives and works in New York City. He is the author of 'The Soccer Book,' about the 2002 World Cup and of 'The Soccer Book 2,' a continuation of the same book. Both books explain and analyze the World Cup and provide information on the players, the coaching staff and the teams that will play in the tournament.\n'The Soccer Book 2' provides a little more in depth look at the US national team players in comparison to other nations. Although the US team is not represented in the book, it has an important influence on the players and coaching staff, and what they do for the rest of the World Cup as well.\n'The Soccer Player' is the best book that Tommy has ever", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

Answer: You can easily calculate how much sleep you need. If you sleep 8 hours, you need 6 hours to keep your body and mind healthy. You can do this with the help of the calculator. The following formula has been used as standard procedure in all clinical trials. A sleeping person, aged 20, is given 4.5 milligrams of Ambien, which is 10% of the maximum recommended dosage which is 35 milligrams. The next morning, he or she is awakened at 1:05 am and given 6 grams of magnesium citrate and 4.5 milligram of melatonin. He or she sleeps the night through without waking up and has a normal waking pattern, without having to go to sleep at a certain hour. This person would need to sleep 4.9 hours to get the required 6 hours and would also get enough vitamin D on this sleep. For that, however, he or she would have to do another 8 hours\u2019 worth of activity \u2013 wake up at 6 am, exercise at 6 am, and go back to sleep for 10 hours. In other words, sleeping at 1:05 am would mean a total of 8 hours, while sleeping at 5:04 am would mean 5 hours. A person who is given this formula needs an average of 7 to 7.5 hours of sleep.\nOutput: 8.5 hours.\n\nInput: The following table is arranged chronologically.

If you weigh 50 kilograms, that is 20 grams.  If you weighed 250 kilograms, that is 8.75 grams. To figure the calories in each serving, divide the serving weight by the number of servings.  A serving of 1000 calories is one g and 100 g equals 8.5 grams. To figure the total number of calories, divide 100 grams by 1000 calories.  2000 calories is 1000 g divided by 2000 calories, or 0.75 grams. To give weight, the total number of calories is 20 grams divided by 0.75 grams. The total caloric content of 50 grams is 1092 calories.

Determine an amount of 100 grams that would equal 0.00015 mg of amino acids, therefore 0.00025 mg.  The value of this is 100 mg divided by 0.00025 mg, or 0.00025 mg divided by 100 mg. The total amount of 100 mg is 0.0008 mg divided by 100 mg, or 0.005 mg per gram.  Divide 0.005 mg by 0.00000000005,", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

You can do the experiment on a group of five or more.You'll give one paper to one group and the other to another.  The next question will be:Who's paper has the answers that are most special?\nYou want a fair number of people doing it.  Don't be surprised if the answers are too similar, though.

If you decide that it's optional, please state your reasoning in the comments section.\nYou'll ask them only to put the names of the people in the book instead of the number.  In this group of five or more, you want at least two people.  You'll ask a few of them to put a question into the notebook with the names of the people who are giving them the answers, and the third group to write the answers out.\nYou want each person who is given the paper to do what's interesting for them in order to reduce group thought.

(Note: There is no formula to calculate the number of times he has appeared since the attack.)  Let B be the number of days that he has appeared on the news and C be the number of times per day.  You can work out both number of days by working out how many times the average person appears on the news.  After all, what the average person sees during his three days off is the prime time.  To find C you just have to calculate the times the average person is watching the news and divide that by the number of days that are in the third week of August.\n(Note: A number of people think that the formula for calculating the number of times that Bush is on the news is wrong.  I don't believe there is a formula for calculating it correctly, as there are different methods that give different results.)\nOutput: B = 17.

What is the numerator?\nOutput: The same number as the man. 10% of them is more than 40% of the others.\n\nInput:Suppose you have three tables: Table 3,1, 2,3. The first one is $3, the second one $2, the third one $1. If $2/3 is the average, then why is $2/3 divided by 3?\nOutput: Divide 3 by 3 to get the percentage. 3/3 is 60. That makes 60*3*3/3 = 6, so the divisor is 6. But divide 6 by 3 to get the numerator. The denominator is 13 and 1/3 are the same as 13, so 13*3*3/13 = 1, or 1/(13 * 3/3).\nOutput: Calculate the denominator. That is 13*3*3*1/3 = 1/(13 * 3 + 3/3). That one is only 1/13, so it doesn't change the answer.\n\nInput:The car and the bus go to the same school. The buses ride two hours apart. The car arrives an hour later than the bus.

Since no students are required to come to school, 9/(3*2*2) = 0.8. The square root of the square root of -1 is -6.8, so the sum of the square roots of 1 and 2 is 0.8/0.8 = 0.4, so the square root of the square roots of 2 and 3 is 0.4/(3*2*3/3). That's 3/4. The square root of -1/4 is -1/4, so 3/4 = 10\n\nInput:This is the number that is 3 1/2 times as much as the next smallest number.

After a long and difficult debate and discussion, the government decides to prosecute the war criminal but to have the war criminals sentenced in a civil proceeding after they are convicted on the war crime.  The civil penalty is a fine of 30 years at the end of which there will be a remission of 10 years.  Now suppose there are an equal number of criminal charges available for both parties.  The civil penalty for both parties is equal to 30 times the value of their sentence times the number of years that is available for remission.  The civil penalty per offense is equal to the number times the monetary penalty/year times 100 years.  Then the civil penalty is a penalty of 10% of the amount the government spends.  Therefore, the civil penalty for both parties would be 30% of the amount the civil officer spends in a year.  Using this example, the civil penalty per offense is $100 divided by 7,000 which equals $10,000.  If the civil penalty per individual is $20,000 then the civil penalty per year per person would be $100,000.  Divide 30 by 7", "answer": "E: control"}

{"text": "E\n\nInput:The most common mistake you can make after trying to solve the game as quickly as possible is to try to solve the board even more slowly. One way to do this is to consider moving from the solution as quickly as possible to the solution slowly. For example, suppose that we have a game of P-E-N, and one move is called an attack. You could choose to attack one of the white players, then the remaining player, or you could attack both of the white and blue players. If you attack only the red player, it is possible that you can make only one additional move, and the white player will get a lot of extra pieces. To reduce the number of possible moves, it may be better to attack the blue player, then the white player, then neither, then either of the two blue players, etc. If you attack both blue and white players at once, you reduce the maximum number of possible moves each player can make, but you reduce the number of positions each player can take so that the pieces do not move around in an untracked pattern on the board. If you attack only one or both of the white and red players at once, both players will still have enough extra pieces to make many more moves. By attacking only the white player, it is possible to maximize the number of moves before you will have to return to the solution. If you attack two or more players simultaneously, your opponent\u2019s pieces stay untracked, so you may return to the solution more quickly. If you attack only two people, such as by attacking everyone three times in a row, you sacrifice your speed in getting back to the solution. If three players are attacked, you have to attack one player in every move. You may also try to solve the game a particular number of moves at a time. For example, suppose you have a game of P = 20, 20 + 10 = 30. If you attack both black and white first, then only both white and red next, and then black and red, you may take just enough time to move to 40 moves, but you will need an extra time for the answer. As an example, one possible move you may take while in this position is: (20, 20 + 10 + 30) = (20, 20, 20 + 10) = (40, 40, 10). (In other words, attacking the black player first gives you a position with pieces at 12, which are completely untracked for the next one", "answer": "A: strain"}

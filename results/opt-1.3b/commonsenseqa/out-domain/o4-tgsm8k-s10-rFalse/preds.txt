Choices:  A: under rocks B: manhattan C: toenails D: grocery store E: fallen tree<n>Output:		 A<n><n>Comments:<n>1) No. You're looking for D as an answer.<n>2) No. Your question is missing the point - it's not about what *amount* of photosynthesis will destroy a fungus, but rather how *much*! Your question also makes no reference to whether it is a fungus that takes advantage of photosynthesis, like D, or if it's a fungus that is in competition with photosynthesis like C... it's a question of what *percentage* of all photosynthesis could be eaten by the fungus, so how much of the photosynthesis they can take advantage of.<n>3) You're correct that it's correct to say what kind of photosynthesis your example requires. It's also correct to say what kind *increase* in photosynthesis you're talking about - you can't increase photosynthesis by only growing a single plant, so you don't *have* to grow a fungus.<n>My first guess was a fungus that is in compete with photosynthesis and which eats all the photosynthesis. Your second guess would be a fungus that requires *some* photosynthesis and which is able to *take advantage* of some of that photosynthesis.<n>4) I disagree with your third guess, to be honest. A fungus like D would almost certainly require more photosynthesis than something like, let's say, a bacteria.

Air Quality Index (AQI) is calculated using the concentration of PM2.5 in the breath.  The concentration is measured between zero and 10.  The AQI below 20 is considered good air quality, 1–10 is considered very good air quality, and 11 and higher is considered hazardous air quality.  The concentration of PM2.0 in the breath of a normal adult is 0.001 mw/s2.  A concentration from 10 to 20 is bad air quality (AQ1). If you add all of the adults in the world we have to measure the concentration of PM2.5 in their breaths to make our calculations. We then find, using the concentration measured above 20, the average AQI.   The graph below shows the concentration of PM2 .5 in the sleep breath, broken down by country!<n>Output: 35<n><n>Input:What percentage of the oil and natural gas that we burn is from petroleum in the ground?<n>Output: 1/3<n><n>Input:For a 5-year-old boy who is currently reading at a grade level of 5 and is expected to succeed at school, what is his reading performance?<n>Output: 85<n><n>Input:The air you breathe can contain about 3,000,000 bacteria and viruses.

Adam wanted to order three packages of nuts and fruits. It costs $18.00 for three packages. Adam gave his friend a piece of paper, a couple of fingers and said: Do you know what I want to order?<n>Output: 47<n><n>Input: In a previous experiment, a psychologist assigned Adam a score of about 70 on a 10-point scale, the maximum possible. The psychologist asked Adam to guess the size of a banana. Adam guessed 9 inches in diameter. The psychologist said that Adam could not use the numerical scale from the past because it was impossible to assess an object’s exact size.  If the scale is a real factor in whether someone thinks an object is small or large, then Adam would be correct only if the scale does not exist. Assuming instead that all people have a natural sense of scale and that people are not conscious observers of their “actual scale”, the psychologist suggests a simple alternative. Adam may be close in size, but his guess is a fraction of an inch smaller than the bananas that are actually purchased. Adam now weighs 12 inches.<n>Output: 48<n><n>Input: What is the difference between an average length and a maximum length?

He interviews for 7 openings.  All of the jobs require a 2 year degree or its equivalent - even the ones that do not, and he decides to go for the "most attractive" job out of the 7.  He applies for 4 positions.  He interviews for 1.  He never actually gets a call back from any of the 4 places he applied, nor does anyone apply for his position.  His interview with the most attractive job was so lackluster that he left it blank, so he didn't submit a resume.

So there will only be A + B + C + D + F.<n>A-D-E-FC-FC-FR-FR-FR-FB = 9<n>The team with the most points over the 15 games wins.

The first 2 to 4 days of the semester are a test week.  The last 14 days of the semester are rest days.  If Alice has 4 friends, her daily consumption of alcohol at school is  to:  * 3 (4) * 1.00 (4).  That is, she will drink 1,200 alcoholic drinks per day at school, or 13,400 per year.  In general students consume 3-5 beers, 1.5 ounces to 1 liter of alcohol per year at school, 1,500 to 2,000 shots per year at home.  In addition, during the university year about one thousand college students a year die from cirrhosis of the liver (liver related deaths in Canada).  This year Alice drinks more alcohol than every year before, and every year after.  Alice has an alcoholic drink about every night of every week of every month of every year for the past five years and the past 20 years.  Alice drinks on average  four beers and 12 shots per week of alcohol, so that's  about  20 grams of alcohol per day.  Also in other parts of the world where alcohol is consumed by a higher percentage of the population, it's commonly  accepted that alcohol consumption at school is more prevalent than alcohol consumption at home.  Also in some countries only college students are allowed to drink at school and not at home.  In countries where home and school alcohol consumption overlap, it's generally agreed to be a major source of alcohol-related  social problems.  During the first weeks of the new semester Alice wants to reduce her personal alcohol consumption, because she knows that her drinking has raised her scores on the drinking assessment tests,

First, find the closest site to you based on location and time. If a site shows up that you want to visit, start planning now for what you may want to do. If one of the sites gives you a map, download it to your computer and look at it carefully to see how to plan a plan based on where it shows a place.<n><n>When you are at the site, take a quick look to see what the activities are and how far along they are. Some sites say “We're at this location!” (e.g. we visited the park today, go inside to eat lunch, etc.); others say “We're halfway there!” or simply “We're here” (e. g. we visited the park a month ago, go inside to play). You may have a general idea of the activities, and you may want to get yourself to the park if you can. Don't worry if some of the information is vague, since that's probably only because you haven't been there for some time. Just make sure you start the journey when the activities are at completion!<n><n>If you have no idea what to plan, just go there and ask around. Ask if they know of anyone who might have a job they can direct you to. See if you can get directions to the nearest restaurant or coffee shop so you can ask a worker there if they know where something to eat might be. Ask if there is a grocery store near this place so you can ask if they have grocery coupons for this place or that place and they can see if someone can help you. In fact, ask everyone you see about any job possibilities, any businesses that might be hiring, or any things the local area can do that would be helpful. Ask about the weather, and see what kinds of activities would be at the park when it was nice out. Then ask if there is any kind of entertainment for children or other activities for people older than you. Ask if there is any type of government office nearby, since that might be where you could get information about welfare, unemployment, and such. You'll probably want to ask any local residents if they've heard anything about the government office or job opportunities nearby. Ask if there's any kind of local organization that can help you get out of your area (i. e. if the local church is interested in organizing a free or reduced groceries event

Choices:  A: hoof B: kentucky derby C: race track D: painting E: triple crown<n>Output:		 22<n><n>Input:In order to increase the chance of winning the Kentucky Derby, the trainer's horse needs to have the highest point value.  The trainer can achieve this by adding an additional 50/50 or 20/80 to her horses points.  If the horse also has the highest point value of the pack, she should always get the winner.  Let's call the pack A.  In order to get points A she could  take the horses points in B, C, D, E,  and so on.  Let's call horse D a very talented performer.  Horse D points total should be A+B+C+D + E=E+D+E.  Horse D therefore needs to achieve the following in order to win the Kentucky Derby:  E+Horse D+Horse E must all have the highest point value  E must be the highest horse in her pack  Horse D needs the highest points for E+Horse E  The best way to earn points like horse D is to perform A-B-C and get points from E. Horse D wins the Kentucky Derby by winning the next horse. Her next horse is obviously E+Horse D. However, if horse E is the next horse then horse A must win horse B, C, and D+Horse E+Horse D must all have E+Horse E which is a very unlikely possibility.  Let's call her A+.  Horse A wins the Kentucky Derby by taking the point values of horses E-F as their respective odds. Let's call her A+F+.  Horse A must also achieve the following in order for her to win the Kentucky Derby;  F must win horse D, E must be the highest point horse in her pack, and D need to finish ahead of horse E in point value. Let's call horse E the highest card in the pack.  Her next horse is obviously D+Horse D+F+C+E. Horse D is unlikely to be higher point value than horse F. Suppose horse E finishes ahead of horse F in point value.  Horse E wins the Kentucky Derby by finishing ahead of Horse A. Horse A needs to achieve the following to  win the Kentucky Derby; 1 must win horse A, horse D, or F must race ahead of horse G. Let's call horse G the lowest points horse in her pack. Horse G does not win the Kentucky Derby by finishing in the position required by horse A. Therefore, horse A

The total number of games played in a season is 82, while the 50 minute time period is 45.  The number of games per season thus is 80 (12*45).  To calculate the total number of goals, add up the time periods.  Since 82 and 45/50 = 30 the total number of goals is 40, and 32 would be 40 (because the number of goals scored by one player is 20%).  Thus, the total number of goals in a season is 80/60 = 54 points.<n>   Out of 82 games, 60 games are played in the regular season, and the remaining 40 games (9/18 x 40) are in the playoffs.  That gives you the total number of games played, 82 plus 9/18 = 84.<n>Now, add up the number of games played in the regular season and playoffs: 84 - 81 = 56, and 56 - 56 = 30, which gets rid of the 30.  Now, subtract 30 from 54 to get the total number of goals this season and last season:  50 - 57 = 37.<n><n>input:John buys 2 kilograms of nuts and 2 kilograms of dried fruits at the store.

The number of chickens sold on a given day is 5.  So the average daily chicken sales were $30.  The average daily egg sales were $20.  The total gross per week was $1000.  Calculated in Dollars. Average gross per week (Weekly) - Average daily chicken/day net sales: $1375 - $1850 = $7000 + $1000 = $7200 per week.  The net sale was $6900 per week = $9200 per week.<n>Output #2- A - The total amount of potatoes sold in the given month is $4.50. The average daily sales are $2.25. The total daily potato sales were $0.20. The total gross per week is $800.  Calculated in dollars. Average gross per week - Average daily potato net sales: $3500 + $1200 = $6000 net sales.  The net sale was about $4000 per week = $4500 per week.  Hence the net sale was $4500 per week = $10400 per week.<n>Output #3- A - The total number of pieces of meat sold in the given month are 4.5kg.  The average daily sales are 12.5kg. Hence the total gross per week is 30.5kg = $13.30<n>Output #4 - A - The total number and dollar value on the Christmas Day dinner, which cost $60.00 is $5,600.  The total amount earned by the owner of the dinner is $3000.  The gross sales was $40,000.   The net sales was $30,000.  Hence the gross per week by the owner of the Christmas dinner was $45,000.  Hence

In your Economics textbook, you are given this statement, in which you are given five assumptions: (1) the economy is a dynamic system. (2) the market price of a common good is determined by supply and demand. (3) money is the same as credit in the marketplace. (4) money can be withdrawn without penalty but lost on discharge. (5) the cost of a service such as a meal is fixed and cannot be modified. In order to figure out what the “price” is for a new meal, what percentage of the money spent will actually make it to the owner? [1]<n><n>4.

If I am playing multiple people or tournament rules, I'm sure they want me to have enough players to play as fast as possible against. However, when I enter in the number and look at the stats I see that the NFL has a goal for each quarter - 8, 10, or 12 points in a quarter. Is this different than playing in an individual, 2v2 or 3v3 tournament?<n><n>One of the more complex question is the final numbers; how do you define "a person" if you include people living outside the country? A person can be anyone that you would consider to be someone (other than the player on the other team... he doesn't count I bet). It would be interesting to calculate the number of people that played football for the US that are eligible by nationality.<n><n>The question about the amount of fuel you're supposed to have to give you 2-4 hours of flying time, is this based on your actual weight (a person who isn't overweight can run for that much time, after all), or the average weight of the people flying on that plane?<n><n>Well I looked at the data and it would seem that the 2-4 hours is based on weight. If I'm overweight I will probably run less than someone who isn't. I wouldn't be surprised if overweight people had a harder time running.<n>I think in most tournaments you can play until you can't run no matter what, but I may be wrong.

Thanks,<n>Chris<n><n>*** Answer ***<n><n>The first reason for the increase in fuel price is that, in the past, it was much less of a problem to refill a plane by purchasing a second empty tank. In the new model, the new size of the tank and, therefore, the price, depends on the size of the plane, which changes depending on its weight.<n><n>Since the increase of 20% is in relation to a higher total number of flights, and given the fact that the number of flights in the league will increase, it is natural that the final cost of fuel will increase in proportion to it.<n><n>If the fuel cost would not have increased by more than 20%, the same amount of fuel would have cost a plane 100% less. The price of fuel should be as low as possible, otherwise, it would not be profitable for airlines to take the planes (in this case the “plane” that we are talking

On the other hand, even if all the goals scored by all players during a game are equal, if the total number of goals is smaller than the number of goals scored by players even if all the players score the same goal, the game will be won by one of the players. Suppose that a player scores a goal in 5 minutes in the first game of 2 games and another player scores a goal in 15 minutes in the next game when their teams are tied, but if there are equal number of goals scored during two games in both games, the game will be decided by whoever scores the goal first in the second game.<n><n>The players will score goals against each other by making passes, using kicks, and shooting goals. However, they will not give assists to each other. Thus, there will be no player whose actions contribute to the goals. Each player's actions contribute to the goals in the same way that each players' actions contribute to his/her own goals during a game by his/her actions. Thus, all actions contribute equally to the goals scored by those players.<n><n>In the case of goals against, one player will receive assists from two other players after scoring a goal against each other. For example, for a goal scored by player A in the first game against player B, player A will receive two assists from player B after the score is level. Then player B's goal will be worth two goals and player A will be awarded one assist from each of them. However, the player receiving the two assists and three goals will take a double goal, and, as a result, will have a total of six goals for the game. The same will happen, except that player A will receive three assists and two goals, and player B will receive one assist. Thus, for a single goal

Most users usually try to look for mistakes in the code, but that gives the wrong results, usually in the exact same place. It's better to think of them much more like search strings. Most of the time they won't mean anything, and you should never assume that they'll actually work.

And to get a feel for each of these nations, readers get to get to know each nation's players, and even get to get to know the world wide soccer fans and fans of those nations as well. The book is a well written, great read that is perfect as a quick reference while you sit down to watch a soccer match.<n><n>In the beginning, the writer's take on the World Cup is that it was a terrible tournament. The book also makes the point that the tournament is over and that fans should just focus on the upcoming United States versus Costa Rica match. It also makes the point that soccer is growing in the US, and that the US national team is good enough to get to the quarterfinals of the tournament. The writers of the guide even point out how hard the tournament was for the US team, and how much they learned from it.<n>The book is full of statistics that would make soccer fans and Americans alike very thankful for the team that represented our country. It also has a great section on the tournament that gives a good idea of what happened both in the tournament and throughout the world.<n><n>About the Author<n><n>Tommy Thompson is a soccer fan that lives and works in New York City.

Answer: You can easily calculate how much sleep you need. If you sleep 8 hours, you need 6 hours to keep your body and mind healthy. You can do this with the help of the calculator. The following formula has been used as standard procedure in all clinical trials. A sleeping person, aged 20, is given 4.5 milligrams of Ambien, which is 10% of the maximum recommended dosage which is 35 milligrams. The next morning, he or she is awakened at 1:05 am and given 6 grams of magnesium citrate and 4.5 milligram of melatonin. He or she sleeps the night through without waking up and has a normal waking pattern, without having to go to sleep at a certain hour. This person would need to sleep 4.9 hours to get the required 6 hours and would also get enough vitamin D on this sleep. For that, however, he or she would have to do another 8 hours’ worth of activity – wake up at 6 am, exercise at 6 am, and go back to sleep for 10 hours. In other words, sleeping at 1:05 am would mean a total of 8 hours, while sleeping at 5:04 am would mean 5 hours. A person who is given this formula needs an average of 7 to 7.5 hours of sleep.<n>Output: 8.5 hours.<n><n>Input: The following table is arranged chronologically.

If it is not possible, however, to have an equal number of goals conceded in the league to Barca, calculate how many players could hit the eight number.

If you weigh 50 kilograms, that is 20 grams.  If you weighed 250 kilograms, that is 8.75 grams. To figure the calories in each serving, divide the serving weight by the number of servings.  A serving of 1000 calories is one g and 100 g equals 8.5 grams. To figure the total number of calories, divide 100 grams by 1000 calories.  2000 calories is 1000 g divided by 2000 calories, or 0.75 grams. To give weight, the total number of calories is 20 grams divided by 0.75 grams. The total caloric content of 50 grams is 1092 calories.

After asking other people, they suggest that Jack just start by checking his old cooling system.  He doesn't do that, but instead starts with a repairman to find out what exactly needs to be done.

You'll need a group of people to keep a notebook or diary and get the answers off of them.  You're going to give one paper to one person randomly and another to another person randomly.  Tell them to write all the answers they can.  You'll ask them only to write the one number that means the most.  You want at least four answers, but no more than six. You can do the experiment on a group of five or more.You'll give one paper to one group and the other to another.  The next question will be:Who's paper has the answers that are most special?<n>You want a fair number of people doing it.  Don't be surprised if the answers are too similar, though.  So: Who's paper has the answers more valuable than others?  I'd go w/o the last question, but I really like the last question and would prefer it to be optional. If you decide that it's optional, please state your reasoning in the comments section.<n>You'll ask them only to put the names of the people in the book instead of the number.  In this group of five or more, you want at least two people.  You'll ask a few of them to put a question into the notebook with the names of the people who are giving them the answers, and the third group to write the answers out.<n>You want each person who is given the paper to do what's interesting for them in order to reduce group thought.  I might limit them to put two questions into the notebook in order to avoid any groupthink.<n><n>** You may have used it before, but I think it's worth mentioning again: we're looking for answers not just for the sake of the experiment, but because you may have previously done something, and would like to share these answers with other people. You can do this either by commenting on the answers you'd like to share, or you can post your answers with the comment sections below and then others will make sure that the answers are not copied.<n><n>The last experiment is a little unusual, and will be for the benefit of a different group of people: the students.<n><n>*** Please note: This is a science experiment in several ways. The main one is the "group" you choose. For each of these groups, try thinking

It isn't so much math as it is about game theory. In other words, you're allowed to do something to your pieces in a single round so you do it. When you're done, everything you own is worth $$$, and every possible value is represented by a piece.<n><n>But it is also a short, yet amazing book. I would read it again, not less.<n><n>Edit: I was wrong about a couple things, but I've also been wrong about a couple things before. That's part of why I love math.<n><n>I'm not seeing how a retailer can sell a product for less than $100 if the product cost $200. I am seeing how the retailer can sell it at a profit. There is no way to sell for less.<n><n>Also, I've read that in the American context the $100 price is actually $25 as the Canadian $100 has a "C" at the end. The $1 price of Walmart is not necessarily the low price you might think of. $1 isn't lower than $1 per item. Walmart does have prices of $1 per item, but they are all just the normal price as the company tries to keep its costs low. However, Walmart also has lower prices on a bunch of other items so it can afford $1 per item. It only lists the per item price when there is a sale. It is a pretty well-known practice. I'm not sure if there is a Canadian equivalent.

You can work out both number of days by working out how many times the average person appears on the news.  After all, what the average person sees during his three days off is the prime time.  To find C you just have to calculate the times the average person is watching the news and divide that by the number of days that are in the third week of August.<n>(Note: A number of people think that the formula for calculating the number of times that Bush is on the news is wrong.

The first one is $3, the second one $2, the third one $1. If $2/3 is the average, then why is $2/3 divided by 3?<n>Output: Divide 3 by 3 to get the percentage. 3/3 is 60. That makes 60*3*3/3 = 6, so the divisor is 6. But divide 6 by 3 to get the numerator. The denominator is 13 and 1/3 are the same as 13, so 13*3*3/13 = 1, or 1/(13 * 3/3).<n>Output: Calculate the denominator. That is 13*3*3*1/3 = 1/(13 * 3 + 3/3).

Have all pro players obtained the correct answers as well?<n><n>Output: A government in the middle of wartime has to choose between a war crime and saving the lives of its citizens.  After a long and difficult debate and discussion, the government decides to prosecute the war criminal but to have the war criminals sentenced in a civil proceeding after they are convicted on the war crime.  The civil penalty is a fine of 30 years at the end of which there will be a remission of 10 years.  Now suppose there are an equal number of criminal charges available for both parties.  The civil penalty for both parties is equal to 30 times the value of their sentence times the number of years that is available for remission.  The civil penalty per offense is equal to the number times the monetary penalty/year times 100 years.  Then the civil penalty is a penalty of 10% of the amount the government spends.  Therefore, the civil penalty for both parties would be 30% of the amount the civil officer spends in a year.  Using this example, the civil penalty per offense is $100 divided by 7,000 which equals $10,000.  If the civil penalty per individual is $20,000 then the civil penalty per year per person would be $100,000.  Divide 30 by 7

The researchers throw their balls at a test target from a height of 8'.<n><n>1.1. The researchers take two balls and hit the same target twice.<n>1.2. The researchers hit the same target three times. Then they hit it with a third ball.<n><n>1.3. The researchers take three balls and throw them at a "tosser". They first hit him with the rubber ball and then throw it at him with a wooden ball, about 6mm in diameter. They then get another rubber ball to see if it will bounce off him.<n><n>2. To get the most realistic results, the researchers use the following:<n>a) a rubber ball that weighs 1.5g<n>b) a rubber ball that weights 3g<n>c) the same rubber ball that weighs 1g<n>d) two rubber balls (that weigh 1g apiece) that they have each placed in their respective mouths<n><n>2.1. The testers hold each of the balls in one hand while throwing them at the tosser. When they throw it at the tosser, it hits the target only about 1/15 of the distance it would have hit under the normal conditions.<n><n>2.2. Next time, they try to throw the ball as hard as they can. If they manage to hit him with the rubber (weight 3g) ball, they will lose the game. If they manage to throw it as hard as they can, they will probably defeat the tosser without even having to aim at his head.<n><n>2.3. If each of the objects weighed 3g and bounced off the tosser, they would hit a target about 1/12th of the distance they would have hit over the normal conditions.<n>This is the first example of a machine-

Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n>Output:		 E<n><n>Input:The most common mistake you can make after trying to solve the game as quickly as possible is to try to solve the board even more slowly. One way to do this is to consider moving from the solution as quickly as possible to the solution slowly. For example, suppose that we have a game of P-E-N, and one move is called an attack. You could choose to attack one of the white players, then the remaining player, or you could attack both of the white and blue players. If you attack only the red player, it is possible that you can make only one additional move, and the white player will get a lot of extra pieces. To reduce the number of possible moves, it may be better to attack the blue player, then the white player, then neither, then either of the two blue players, etc. If you attack both blue and white players at once, you reduce the maximum number of possible moves each player can make, but you reduce the number of positions each player can take so that the pieces do not move around in an untracked pattern on the board. If you attack only one or both of the white and red players at once, both players will still have enough extra pieces to make many more moves. By attacking only the white player, it is possible to maximize the number of moves before you will have to return to the solution. If you attack two or more players simultaneously, your opponent’s pieces stay untracked, so you may return to the solution more quickly. If you attack only two people, such as by attacking everyone three times in a row, you sacrifice your speed in getting back to the solution. If three players are attacked, you have to attack one player in every move. You may also try to solve the game a particular number of moves at a time. For example, suppose you have a game of P = 20, 20 + 10 = 30. If you attack both black and white first, then only both white and red next, and then black and red, you may take just enough time to move to 40 moves, but you will need an extra time for the answer. As an example, one possible move you may take while in this position is: (20, 20 + 10 + 30) = (20, 20, 20 + 10) = (40, 40, 10). (In other words, attacking the black player first gives you a position with pieces at 12, which are completely untracked for the next one

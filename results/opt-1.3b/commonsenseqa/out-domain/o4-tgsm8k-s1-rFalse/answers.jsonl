The other employee works as the general manager or office manager. The manager is often the boss, or in charge, of the office manager. The manager and the office manager may share responsibility for the entire company. If the male manager is responsible for a business and he is the only employee or he is the only office manager then the manager is responsible only for his own business. If he is responsible for other offices and other departments than his own then the office manager is responsible only for the departments or offices that the manger manages. However, if the two business owners are partners in the same company then the manger is responsible for both the manager and office manager. The name of the office manager is not important.

He has a green house, too. He thinks you should at least try living in a farm if you're not afraid of them, and invites you down to see his animals. Your friend takes you down, and you learn that his cow named \"Fat Albert\" eats grass, eats fruit, and uses a trough for pee. \"Fat Albert\" also has a little potty and sleeps in a loft of straw. Sometimes he makes lots of noise, because he's a very noisy animal. Other places \"Fat Albert\" roams are the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, and the bathroom again. Then your friend says that he wants to give you $20, since you can't afford a new pair of shoes. After you earn $20 he'll send you $10 so you can buy a new pair of shoes and $5 so you can go out with him.

{"text": "8\n\nInput: Mary and Zach make $50 each in the same round. When Mary writes that she \"earned $150\" her friend Zach looks at Mary's journal and asks what exactly she earned. Mary replies, \"I earned $149.\" Zach explains that she made $150 this time because she earned $2 on Tuesday instead of $15 on Monday. His friend replies that $2 is the minimum he would take for working and so he earns the full $150. Mary replies that he can buy the candy with his allowance and he doesn't have to do any mowing this week. He also doesn't mind the extra chores. Then he comments that he doesn't have anything to do with the money he earns since he didn\u2019t save any of it, but instead spent it in the store. Mary says he is making a good point and then she tells him that she is saving it since she will have to pay off her bills if she doesn\u2019t buy any groceries. Zach replies that the extra money will go towards his new bike and that he will buy it on his allowance next week. He adds that he and Mary might make a trip to a toy store.

I'll pack their luggage, bring it to their departure gate and I'll carry it for them.  I'll set a schedule for when they will be arriving.  I'll keep track of their bags and luggage, and I'll pack and pack and pack until their bags are ready to go.  I'm going to be the only one left after they board the planes.

You can also submit a quiz if you want and have others answer it.\n\n[edit]Scores\n\nEach quiz is worth 8 points. Each correct answer in the quizzes will score you 3 points and each incorrect answer will score you 5 points. For example, 3 points will be awarded for a correct answer of \"A washing machine\" and 6 points will be awarded for incorrect answers of \"A washing machine\".\n\nEach quiz also has an \"F\" rating;\n\nPoints are rounded up to the next-highest score.\n\nFractions, decimals, decimals, and percent are calculated on an 8-level-distances scale of 100 (e.g. 2.15 = 100 per cent, 20% equals 8 per cent) and 500 (e.g. 1.25 = 50 per cent).\n\nIncentives\n\nThese quizzes are worth 60 \"points\" to earn 20 \"bucks\" to use for any activity.\n\nEach \"buck\" can be spent on any activity. The \"buck\" is not converted into points as soon as an activity is completed.\nA \"buck\" is equal to 3 points, so for example: If you have ten \"bucks\" and you earn 5 in an activity, you will have enough points/bucks to buy one cookie. So if you spend your \"bucks\" as soon as you earn them, you will be awarded 5 points and the points you earn during that activity will count towards your total. The activity doesn't need to be completed to earn points/bucks. In fact, some activities only count towards one or a couple of points.\nA \"buck bonus\" is rewarded for answering the quiz correctly. If you earn a \"buck bonus\" then the amount of \"points\" in your \"buck\" will increase by 0.015 points per additional \"buck\". So if you earn a \"buck\" bonus of say 3.50 points, then you will have 0.15 extra points on your \"buck\" each time you answer a quiz.", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

Susan decided she would hold a swap meet to split the money between the families and the kids.  Two boys came and asked for some change.  When they offered $0.25 per cookie the children refused to take it.  Susan then offered $0.65 per cookie.  When the children saw these figures they were so shocked that they could barely speak. Susan was so pleased that children would not take a penny from her and she knew that she had a winner. Susan's plan went exactly as planned and Susan raised $10 in five hours.  What dollar amount was Susan willing to accept for a dollar?   Output: 50%\n*$0.25 - $0.65 = $8.88 / $10 worth of cookies.\n*50% of $10 = $4.48 / $10 worth of candy and chips.\n*100% of $10 =$16.56 / $10 worth of clothes and other things.\n*100%$16.56 =$14.96 worth of toys and books.\n*The 100% was calculated based on the number of cookies sold, not $15- $16 divided by 2 = $144.85\nYou were given $15 to buy 20 cookies $1.65 divided by 2 = $14.64.  When you multiply the number of cookies you purchased by 20, you would have to buy $14.64 worth of cookies to make $144.85.  This is the total amount needed to make $144.84.\nIf you multiply the cost of the cookies by $1.65 then $144.84 / 5 hours = $144.32 = $144.64.\nThis is the amount that Susan needs to raise.  What is the total amount that she needs to raise?\n*$144.32*$15 = $144.72   *$144.72 - $15 = $88.00   ~~\n\nInput:You had $9000 saved, all of your clothes are clean, you have a beautiful home, and no one has to work hard for you.

{"text": "A: Philosophy C: Ask Questions D: Further Education E: Study Together  -------\n\nAnswer: A\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe question was a test question that I found at a writing conference I attended. The writer asked this question to make students think about the question again. A test question like this is used to help students think about a question to the second-level questions like \"why do you think I'm answering this question?\"\nI also encourage students to think about the questions again after writing. I suggest using \"what do the questioners think?\" when they are unable to answer the question or they miss a word. Using \"what questions were there in this question?\" encourages students to think about why they are answering and consider when to use \"answer\" instead of \"ask\" for a better answer.\n\nThis question is an excellent example of \"thinking of questions later,\" which is one of my favorite strategies to use with students. One of the ways I implement this strategy is writing questions with a thought exercise that focuses on the question. In this example, I wrote questions that focus on the idea \"why do you think you're answering this question?\" or \"why are you answering this question?\" Students will be encouraged to think about this question for a while after they answer it, which helps them think about this question as a \"writing prompt.\"\n\nIf you have trouble with this question, look for questions on the Web that are similar. Or, read the questions again to make them more concrete. And if you need more help, feel free to contact me at kim@summysummit.com, 703-345-0150 or by email. :)\n\n*This site is provided by your high school counselor to help students improve their academic performance.

The tribes have lived there for centuries. The nation of Syria is Arab. It contains around 70 percent Arab population. Syria has been divided into two different areas: Northern and Southern Syria. The Northern Syria is rich in oil resources and has been a source of power for Syrian government in charge of the territory. The Middle Eastern region is rich in minerals and minerals of Syria are used in some of the big factories. The area is called North Syria. Syria is not big enough to hold all the refugees from the surrounding countries. Syria can only hold around 3 million refugees. They come from countries like Egypt, Iran, Iraq and Lebanon. It is not big enough to support all the refugees. Since Syrian government has control over the areas around it, people outside of Syrian government can not enter into it and work inside Syria. People from these countries can not enter Syrian territory to work because it is not safe. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Israel and Iran can not enter into Syria because they may be shot. The government of Syria is not big enough for all the refugees. Syria has a country size of around 200,000. The country is big enough for only 3.5 million refugees. Syrian government can not hold up the refugees from Syria and other countries. So, Syrian government has to help a lot by sending them to other countries in countries like Australia, Canada and the United States. The international community can not help because a lot of refugees have to come directly from Syria. The United Nations can help by working more with Syrian government and help to find ways to reduce the number of refugees.\nOutput:\n2", "answer": "D: dedication"}

(In other words: which book has 1250 words.)\nOutput: 1000\n\nThe first page has the most words in this version. The word count is based on books that don\u2019t have 100 pages. If there are 1000 total words in the book the first page has 3100 words.\n\nThe second page has more words than the first page. The total words in both pages is 2000.\n\nThe third page has the same amount words as the second page. In the third page the total words are 3000.\n\nThe fourth page has the same amount of words as the second page but less than the third.

In the fifth page the total words are 200040.\n\nSo which of the five books has the most words on page one?\n\nOn some of the books the total words are on page 2 or more. The fifth page is on page 300 in the books we are counting so far. On many other books the words are on page 1. The total words for each of the books is on page 1500.\n\nOn many books the total words are total on page 500 or more.

Books with only about 3 sentences on page 100 have 2000 or more words on the first page.\n\nThe first page of a book is not always the bottom or longest page. Books with long pages may have many shorter pages.\n\nMany books have a beginning, an ending, and a middle. The first paragraph or two may be on a longer page.\n\nSome books just have little paragraphs all on one page.\n\nSome of the books have no beginning or ending \u2013 you just know that all the words are on", "answer": "C: deafness"}

Those exams show that the skull is not strong enough to support cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). If CSF accumulates in the back of the skull, it causes a condition called Cerebral Spinal Fluid Storage Disease (CSFDS) and can be an indication that your child may have to be hospitalized. If the craniosorhinectomy has been ordered by a cardiologist, an orthopedic surgeon and a neurologist, then it is called a Cranio CSA.

On the other hand, their parents are very firm about controlling their children\u2019s behavior. This is a very common teaching pattern that many adults adopt. The students often agree that parents have a lot of authority when it comes to disciplining children. They understand this because they themselves were raised in families where their parents were quite strict.\n\nHowever, they also agree that parents can sometimes be unreasonable with their children. Both the student and teacher agreed that the relationship between a parent and child does need to be in a relationship of trust. However, the student stated that sometimes their parents punish their children for minor mistakes as if it is something that they have done, like getting in trouble at school.\n\nFinally, the students also discussed their parents\u2019 involvement in academics. Some students stated that their parents spend a lot of time working at home and making sure that their children are staying on track academically. Some students even stated that one parent might even bring food and drinks for school.\n\nIn conclusion, the students discussed the power that different parents have over their children. Most of them shared that sometimes, their parents treat their children like they themselves were children and their authority is very serious. Other times, their parents treat their kids like they are adults and their authority is very casual and fun. Both kinds of parental authority come with several difficulties. However, they also agreed that it is important to treat kids like children rather than like adults and they can help each other out by doing this.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, the students were given the following resources to continue their thinking and writing.

Restaurant\n\nResponse from Mom: \u201cIf he does not have a problem telling friends about his allowance, then he will need to give his mother a letter or a word document which explains what his allowance is and how much he will spend each week. This will also help her to understand how much different his spending is from hers.\u201d\n\n\u201d The first tip is to ask yourself when you were a child; What was the amount of money given? When you were little (if any) did you use that money to buy yourself something? How? Did you have to spend that money? How about your next check? Were you required to use it? Did you spend the money immediately or wait?\n\u201d\nThe second tip is to ask yourself; I never used it. It was given but I didn\u2019t use it. Did I have to use it? The next answer is \u201d Yes, at least twice a week.\u201d\n\u201d But if there is a question that is not answered, the other tips should be given. I feel like asking for a list of what NOT to do is a little unreasonable. That being said, the other \u201ctips\u201d on her list are all good ideas. I would rather have a list such as the following\u2026\n1. Don\u2019t spend money on something that you could buy with it.\n2. Don\u2019t buy a \u201cbig ticket\u201d item such as a new Xbox 360.\n3. If you have room to spare, pay bills or take out credit cards for money. This also shows that you can be responsible with money.\n4. If you have a computer, get a good one that will allow you to check your accounts in the evening and do your taxes early in the morning. This is good way to stay on top of your account and avoid making mistakes.\n5. If you are buying something expensive, buy one at a time. You will save a lot of time and money.\n6. Never leave money on the counter or sink until you go to check your balance. This will guarantee that you will not spend any money that you shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nAnother tip that is good on how I was was when I was a child. My parents usually told me about their salaries, so", "answer": "B: wedding party"}

If their family income is $2,300 a month, Bob will be able to pay off the $50,000 it took to start a student loan.   If he can start work in less than a month, Bob will earn $800 a month on Friday and spend the extra $1 for the second job.

{"text": "A  KFC (Chick-fil-A) is a fast food restaurant known for their chicken sandwich served on a breaded and battered chicken breast dipped in a hot, gravy based gravy. It is one of the most popular fast food restaurants in America serving over 1 Billion meals yearly.  It has two restaurants in the United States, one in each city, in Atlanta and Jacksonville, Florida. The name comes from a city in Mississippi and an old schoolhouse on a farm where employees were trained to cook the chicken. The brand was named after Colonel Harland Sanders, who later moved his company to Birmingham, Alabama, and established a branch there, where it remained until the company was acquired by Yum! Brands in 2018.  It is based in Lexington, Kentucky.  The restaurant was cofounded by Warren Burchfield who was born in Lexington in 1907 and worked in the chicken business for most of his life.  He was succeeded as CEO by Kevin Murphy during which many changes were made to the restaurant, though the KFC name remained unchanged until Yum! Brands sold it to private equity firm Yum!

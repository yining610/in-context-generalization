Choices:  A: maine B: boston C: beach town D: coastal cities E: ocean<n>Output:		 1<n><n>Input:Zach has $1.00 left from his allowance. He takes it and buys a cookie. Since $1.00 represents.5 cents, the value of the cookie he buys is $0.20. Zach then takes $0.20 off his allowance and gives it to his Mom. He then gives that change to his neighbor Zach. At this point the total $25 will cost $25.00. Zach cannot spend more than $25.00 until he has saved up $27.00. Therefore, Zach can buy the bike until he can get enough money to buy the bike. Once he accumulates $27.00 he can buy the bike. If he cannot, he loses $1.00 and must start saving again.

You need 2 pieces of wood, two pipes, scissors, and glue.” Mark had 2x2 pieces of wood and 2x3 pieces of pipe. He had scissors and glue. He tried to place two pipe pieces into one small hole with the pipe and wood. He got frustrated so he put in two small pipes together with the wood so they would stay together when he finished. Mark asked the boy if he could go to the play area to do something else because he wanted to finish his work. So Mark went into the play area and found 2 more boys to practice on his own. When he finished his work, he got a hug from the older boy and then the younger boy told him to “go back to class to work on your paper.” Mark was irritated. Mark made a new assignment for the following day.

The other employee works as the general manager or office manager. The manager is often the boss, or in charge, of the office manager. The manager and the office manager may share responsibility for the entire company. If the male manager is responsible for a business and he is the only employee or he is the only office manager then the manager is responsible only for his own business. If he is responsible for other offices and other departments than his own then the office manager is responsible only for the departments or offices that the manger manages. However, if the two business owners are partners in the same company then the manger is responsible for both the manager and office manager. The name of the office manager is not important. The name of the manger does not mean that the man man is the manager. The word “manager” is often a title or a designation for the person in charge. The word “man” is used in titles or designations for the person in charge which means that this person has responsibility or authority for the business or that person has the power and authority to decide that decisions must be made.<n><n>## Name

The road next to the parking lot is filled with cars. All of the cars appear to be running and the man is worried because he saw a cop parked the car a few rows back from him.  The man reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out and uses his own belt to secure an elastic band. The man sits down next to the cop and puts the elastic band on the front of his pants. The man looks relieved when he sees the driver's seat still there.  When he starts to pull up his pants, the man notices that his belt is no longer attached.  The man tries to pull the belt down again, but it's no use, because the elastic band is no longer connected to the belt.  The man reaches behind his leg and pulls out the car's dashboard and throws it into the front of his car. He then places the cordless phone on the rear deck. This way, the police won’t question him or know that the cord is missing.  Finally, the man sees an opportunity, and takes a deep breath. He reaches behind his knee and grabs the belt directly below his nuts. He twists and turns and pulls down on the belt until most of the weight is safely inside the car.  The man is surprised when the vehicle starts running.  The car stops suddenly, and the driver is able to get out of the car without being injured.  The driver's side door is unlocked, but the ignition is still turned off. With a glance toward the front of his car, the man realizes there's no one in the passenger seat. He exits the car and sees that his pants are covered with a stain.  He walks to his front door, looks out his window, and sees a police car coming down

Choices:  A: train station B: bookstore C: newsstand D: waiting room E: airport<n>Output:		 8<n><n>Input: Mary and Zach make $50 each in the same round. When Mary writes that she "earned $150" her friend Zach looks at Mary's journal and asks what exactly she earned. Mary replies, "I earned $149." Zach explains that she made $150 this time because she earned $2 on Tuesday instead of $15 on Monday. His friend replies that $2 is the minimum he would take for working and so he earns the full $150. Mary replies that he can buy the candy with his allowance and he doesn't have to do any mowing this week. He also doesn't mind the extra chores. Then he comments that he doesn't have anything to do with the money he earns since he didn’t save any of it, but instead spent it in the store. Mary says he is making a good point and then she tells him that she is saving it since she will have to pay off her bills if she doesn’t buy any groceries. Zach replies that the extra money will go towards his new bike and that he will buy it on his allowance next week. He adds that he and Mary might make a trip to a toy store. Mary just smiles and says, "That's nice of him." Then she thinks about it and comes up with an idea to buy Zach his own bike.<n>Output: 8<n>The math will look very similar if the math involves money rather than time.

When she says "YOU COULD", Mary says no, she couldn't do that yet in the class. May says "she could" and so does SHE COULD. The difference for SHE COULD, is that it is a very informal sentence. It doesn't necessarily say that Mary couldn't do it, just that Mary may not be able to do it yet. The informal use of "she could" in this case is really a polite way to say "she really couldn't". So, she maybe can't do it yet, but in a few years she may be able to do it. This is the informal use of "she said" in this sentence.<n><n>Output: "MAY, SHE COULD", "SHE COULD", "YOU COULD".

You may also use a friend's name or a random question and ask the same question twice. After you've provided answers to other questions, I'd like you to write another question:A few weeks ago my best friend asked if I would help her pack up for summer.  I said yes and set out to pack her bags.  I was worried that I would have no room to pack her bags, but I managed to get her all of her clothes and all of her miscellaneous items into small enough packages.  When the day came for her to leave, I cried from the loss of my best friend.  I started thinking that if I was able to pack this much into a smaller package, then I could help other friends and other students.  If I was able to pack more than a box onto one plane, then it meant that I could help other people on other flights.  If I was capable of packing so much into the same amount of space, then I must be able to pack even more in the same amount of space.  So I decided that I'd ask my boss to hire me.  I'm still working as a mailman, but I will now be the mailman for all of these young people.  My plan is simple.  I'll pack their luggage, bring it to their departure gate and I'll carry it for them.  I'll set a schedule for when they will be arriving.  I'll keep track of their bags and luggage, and I'll pack and pack and pack until their bags are ready to go.  I'm going to be the only one left after they board the planes.  I'll take care of their luggage as I would a child's.  I'll make a small room for them and their luggage and store it.  I'll help them if

Is it a square, like a rectangle or is it a triangle? Is it a regular triangle, such as a pentagon, or is it a weird circle (like a heart or a triangle)? I want to know what shape is most similar to a normal human?<n>Output:<n>In mathematics, there exists a certain kind of problem that a human being cannot solve. The problem is called a “probability problem.” Probability is a science and it is about the odds of things happening. If a certain number of people are given an item, it’s most likely that no one will get it right. Each of these people will have a different probability of getting the question wrong. Even if someone tries to guess the number, it takes a certain amount of input from others and so on until there are no more guesses. It would take two hours for 10 people to solve this problem.  The answer would be 11.0159 times your current height. This amount is the probability of being 5.6 percent taller.

There are 3 boys - Jake, Ben, Joe  and Josh.  Jake plays second and is the last on the field.  The ball comes up to him, he kicks it, and both ball and field go into the pond.  Ben and Joe have stopped and are waiting to play soccer with Joe.  Jake jumps in after they finish soccer and the ball comes up to him with a thud... and goes into the pond.  The boys continue to wait to play soccer with Jake, but before he can kick the soccer ball into the pond, he has to stop and put the balls away from all the kids.

The two girls at school go running out to Jake to see just what happened.  He tells them about the soccer ball, the field, and the pond.

Jake and the two girls practice the sport for a long time and then Jake takes his ball and goes outside for a short run.  When it is over with his friends, the two girls go home and the principal calls Jake in to talk to him.  When Jake tells the principal that the girls were joking because he is really good at soccer, they are so impressed that they try to play soccer with him again.

There will be 10 problems in this lesson. Remember to multiply 2 by 3 and add 2. It will be easy to figure out how much money you have left, but also remember to subtract 1.<n><n>I decided to do a simple addition to the problem.<n><n>I took the total amount, multiplied it by 4 and divided that by 3. I came up to 3 dollars before I even subtracted 1. That means I left 3 dollars to pay gas. I think that the lesson will teach students to subtract before using multiples of 4 or 5. I am hoping that math is being taught at the right pace.<n><n>I think the lesson will teach students that you don't have to do any extra work when doing addition and subtraction. If you do things the way you were taught in grade school, you should be able to handle that same exact math in college. I know it sounds like a little much to say it is simple but I hope that math is being taught in the correct way.

While she was gone, Zach came to her room and asked, "Are all your babies in bed?"  Mary said, "I left one in the play room.  Is it there?"  Zach said, "No, it's still out there."  Mary wondered, "Why did you say you left one in the play yard?"  Zach said, “I just forgot it."  When Mary got back, she asked him to show her where the play yard was.  Zach gave her directions to the play yard and said, "Come on.  Don’t go in there.  I told you it was out there."  Mary said, “What’s out there?”  Zach told her that the play zone was an outside corner of the yard.  Mary climbed over a fence and entered the play zone.  The baby fell asleep immediately in the play area.  As Mary was getting out of the yard, Zach saw her coming back in and called, "What are you doing out there?  You’re supposed to have the baby by now."  Mary said, "It hasn’t started sleeping yet." Zach said, "But I left it there!"  Mary said, "Look.  It's right there.  Where are the babies?"

They also realized that no matter how many hours they were willing to put into a project something else would always emerge much faster than they planned.<n>My kids learned to put the time and most of the resources they had into a project and when it would pay off, they could have a new adventure to start.  They learned to stop getting frustrated when something took longer than expected.  They learned to make the most of what they had.  They learned how they could change the world.<n>The lesson I hope their generation learns from is the value of hard work.

He said that "anyone in jail in the U.S. should be hanged" because "not holding up your end of the deal is a sign of weakness, which makes criminals vulnerable." After Adam's sister is released from jail she asks him to go to see his father. Adam agrees. Adam's father is about to shoot a gun at his sister when he drops the gun and says he is sorry. Adam thinks that is a terrible idea for Adam. Adam's father asks Adam how he was so calm. Adam says he felt "blessed" because his father is shot and he got to tell his father goodbye, and he told Adam, "I'll always love you." Adam's father said he was grateful and wished Adam happy birthday. They had a good time. On the way home Adam's family saw a red truck driving on the wrong side of the road. Adam's sister got out of the car and got on the wrong side of it. Adam ran for the truck and picked her up, but as his sister picked herself up, another red truck, moving slowly, crashed into Adam's truck and Adam was crushed and died in the accident. Adam's father said how lucky he was that his truck did not explode. He felt proud of Adam because he "had a good day." Adam then says that he wished his father was a good driver like him for making others happy, and then his father hugs him goodbye.

You can also submit a quiz if you want and have others answer it.<n><n>[edit]Scores<n><n>Each quiz is worth 8 points. Each correct answer in the quizzes will score you 3 points and each incorrect answer will score you 5 points. For example, 3 points will be awarded for a correct answer of "A washing machine" and 6 points will be awarded for incorrect answers of "A washing machine".<n><n>Each quiz also has an "F" rating;<n><n>Points are rounded up to the next-highest score.<n><n>Fractions, decimals, decimals, and percent are calculated on an 8-level-distances scale of 100 (e.g. 2.15 = 100 per cent, 20% equals 8 per cent) and 500 (e.g. 1.25 = 50 per cent).<n><n>Incentives<n><n>These quizzes are worth 60 "points" to earn 20 "bucks" to use for any activity.<n><n>Each "buck" can be spent on any activity. The "buck" is not converted into points as soon as an activity is completed.<n>A "buck" is equal to 3 points, so for example: If you have ten "bucks" and you earn 5 in an activity, you will have enough points/bucks to buy one cookie. So if you spend your "bucks" as soon as you earn them, you will be awarded 5 points and the points you earn during that activity will count towards your total. The activity doesn't need to be completed to earn points/bucks. In fact, some activities only count towards one or a couple of points.<n>A "buck bonus" is rewarded for answering the quiz correctly. If you earn a "buck bonus" then the amount of "points" in your "buck" will increase by 0.015 points per additional "buck". So if you earn a "buck" bonus of say 3.50 points, then you will have 0.15 extra points on your "buck" each time you answer a quiz.

So when Susan asked for a big yard sale on her block,  no one really wanted to go to it.  Susan decided she would hold a swap meet to split the money between the families and the kids.  Two boys came and asked for some change.  When they offered $0.25 per cookie the children refused to take it.  Susan then offered $0.65 per cookie.  When the children saw these figures they were so shocked that they could barely speak. Susan was so pleased that children would not take a penny from her and she knew that she had a winner. Susan's plan went exactly as planned and Susan raised $10 in five hours.  What dollar amount was Susan willing to accept for a dollar?   Output: 50%<n>*$0.25 - $0.65 = $8.88 / $10 worth of cookies.<n>*50% of $10 = $4.48 / $10 worth of candy and chips.<n>*100% of $10 =$16.56 / $10 worth of clothes and other things.<n>*100%$16.56 =$14.96 worth of toys and books.<n>*The 100% was calculated based on the number of cookies sold, not $15- $16 divided by 2 = $144.85<n>You were given $15 to buy 20 cookies $1.65 divided by 2 = $14.64.

Choices:  A: study philosophy B: become adult C: ask questions D: further education E: study together<n>Output:		  A: Philosophy C: Ask Questions D: Further Education E: Study Together  -------<n><n>Answer: A<n><n>----------------------------------------------------------------------<n>The question was a test question that I found at a writing conference I attended. The writer asked this question to make students think about the question again. A test question like this is used to help students think about a question to the second-level questions like "why do you think I'm answering this question?"<n>I also encourage students to think about the questions again after writing. I suggest using "what do the questioners think?" when they are unable to answer the question or they miss a word. Using "what questions were there in this question?" encourages students to think about why they are answering and consider when to use "answer" instead of "ask" for a better answer.<n><n>This question is an excellent example of "thinking of questions later," which is one of my favorite strategies to use with students. One of the ways I implement this strategy is writing questions with a thought exercise that focuses on the question. In this example, I wrote questions that focus on the idea "why do you think you're answering this question?" or "why are you answering this question?"

Write: Two states, Israel.<n>Output:<n><n>Input: In the middle east there is a region called Syria. The region has various tribes who have fought each other for a long time. The tribes have lived there for centuries. The nation of Syria is Arab. It contains around 70 percent Arab population. Syria has been divided into two different areas: Northern and Southern Syria. The Northern Syria is rich in oil resources and has been a source of power for Syrian government in charge of the territory. The Middle Eastern region is rich in minerals and minerals of Syria are used in some of the big factories. The area is called North Syria. Syria is not big enough to hold all the refugees from the surrounding countries. Syria can only hold around 3 million refugees. They come from countries like Egypt, Iran, Iraq and Lebanon. It is not big enough to support all the refugees. Since Syrian government has control over the areas around it, people outside of Syrian government can not enter into it and work inside Syria. People from these countries can not enter Syrian territory to work because it is not safe. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Israel and Iran can not enter into Syria because they may be shot. The government of Syria is not big enough for all the refugees. Syria has a country size of around 200,000. The country is big enough for only 3.5 million refugees. Syrian government can not hold up the refugees from Syria and other countries. So, Syrian government has to help a lot by sending them to other countries in countries like Australia, Canada and the United States. The international community can not help because a lot of refugees have to come directly from Syria. The United Nations can help by working more with Syrian government and help to find ways to reduce the number of refugees.<n>Output:<n>2

Those exams show that the skull is not strong enough to support cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). If CSF accumulates in the back of the skull, it causes a condition called Cerebral Spinal Fluid Storage Disease (CSFDS) and can be an indication that your child may have to be hospitalized. If the craniosorhinectomy has been ordered by a cardiologist, an orthopedic surgeon and a neurologist, then it is called a Cranio CSA. If a craniosorhinotomy has been performed and CSF accumulates in all three parts of the skull, it is called a Cranial CSA. The craniosorhinoscope is a small, non-invasive device that can be used to see the fluid in the back of your child’s skull through the eye. Some people may have a hard time getting a clear image through the device, due to the position of parts of the skull, but the device is usually used very quickly for the necessary scans. During the craniosorhynectomy exam, the craniosorhnoscope is often inserted into the back of the skull and used to inspect the surrounding brain tissue. The procedure takes about five to 10 minutes and can cause a little

One had a white surrender flag and the other had a white surrender flag with stars. Which choice did Mary select?

The thing is I would worry that I would get lost which isn’t something I would want to do. I have a lot of friends with older children and if they got lost I would want to stay with them until we got somewhere safe.”<n><n>The student added, “That’s when I decided I would go by myself.”<n><n>After completing her project, the students had an interesting discussion. The students shared about their experiences as children with other children who lived with them. The students also talked about their parents’ attitudes toward their behaviors.<n><n>The students expressed that with their families, they have no problems with each other. On the other hand, their parents are very firm about controlling their children’s behavior. This is a very common teaching pattern that many adults adopt. The students often agree that parents have a lot of authority when it comes to disciplining children. They understand this because they themselves were raised in families where their parents were quite strict.<n><n>However, they also agree that parents can sometimes be unreasonable with their children. Both the student and teacher agreed that the relationship between a parent and child does need to be in a relationship of trust. However, the student stated that sometimes their parents punish their children for minor mistakes as if it is something that they have done, like getting in trouble at school.<n><n>Finally, the students also discussed their parents’ involvement in academics. Some students stated that their parents spend a lot of time working at home and making sure that their children are staying on track academically. Some students even stated that one parent might even bring food and drinks for school.<n><n>In conclusion, the students discussed the power that different parents have over their children. Most of them shared that sometimes, their parents treat their children like they themselves were children and their authority is very serious. Other times, their parents treat their kids like they are adults and their authority is very casual and fun. Both kinds of parental authority come with several difficulties. However, they also agreed that it is important to treat kids like children rather than like adults and they can help each other out by doing this.<n><n>At the end of the assignment, the students were given the following resources to continue their thinking and writing. The students were encouraged to work on developing their thinking skills by doing brainstorming activities. They were also encouraged to finish their writing assignments to evaluate and refine

This will also help her to understand how much different his spending is from hers.”<n><n>” The first tip is to ask yourself when you were a child; What was the amount of money given? When you were little (if any) did you use that money to buy yourself something? How? Did you have to spend that money? How about your next check? Were you required to use it? Did you spend the money immediately or wait?<n>”<n>The second tip is to ask yourself; I never used it. It was given but I didn’t use it. Did I have to use it? The next answer is ” Yes, at least twice a week.”<n>” But if there is a question that is not answered, the other tips should be given. I feel like asking for a list of what NOT to do is a little unreasonable. That being said, the other “tips” on her list are all good ideas. I would rather have a list such as the following…<n>1. Don’t spend money on something that you could buy with it.<n>2. Don’t buy a “big ticket” item such as a new Xbox 360.<n>3. If you have room to spare, pay bills or take out credit cards for money. This also shows that you can be responsible with money.<n>4. If you have a computer, get a good one that will allow you to check your accounts in the evening and do your taxes early in the morning. This is good way to stay on top of your account and avoid making mistakes.<n>5. If you are buying something expensive, buy one at a time. You will save a lot of time and money.<n>6. Never leave money on the counter or sink until you go to check your balance. This will guarantee that you will not spend any money that you shouldn’t have.<n><n>Another tip that is good on how I was was when I was a child. My parents usually told me about their salaries, so

His parents, who earn more than $400 a month, paid him $7 per hour while he worked for them last year. Bob has one job, but he's having difficulty finding another in town.  He wants to go back to working part-time, but not for much money, so he'll be able to pay off his student loans quickly.  His family will pay him $10 per hour on Friday and $15 on Saturday to clean the house.  If Bob works 4 hours on Friday, he'll have $80 worth of cleaning services he can charge to someone else.  Bob's mother does most of the housework because her job requires lots of lifting heavy things. Her sister works as a cook at a restaurant. If their family income is $2,300 a month, Bob will be able to pay off the $50,000 it took to start a student loan.   If he can start work in less than a month, Bob will earn $800 a month on Friday and spend the extra $1 for the second job. Because his parents earn so much, Bob can afford to pay off his loans in 4.5 years when their incomes will be more than $50,000 each.<n>Output: 4<n>You Can Read More Here:<n><n>Input: What happens if Bob keeps his income down to $500 per month and saves enough money?<n>Output: $6,500<n><n>Input: What is the most money you can save in a week?<n>Output: $25<n><n>Input: What percentage of income do you need to earn before you can live comfortably on $50,000 a year?<n>Output: 55 percent<n><n>Input: There was a tornado in the town.

It is one of the most popular fast food restaurants in America serving over 1 Billion meals yearly.  It has two restaurants in the United States, one in each city, in Atlanta and Jacksonville, Florida. The name comes from a city in Mississippi and an old schoolhouse on a farm where employees were trained to cook the chicken. The brand was named after Colonel Harland Sanders, who later moved his company to Birmingham, Alabama, and established a branch there, where it remained until the company was acquired by Yum! Brands in 2018.  It is based in Lexington, Kentucky.  The restaurant was cofounded by Warren Burchfield who was born in Lexington in 1907 and worked in the chicken business for most of his life.  He was succeeded as CEO by Kevin Murphy during which many changes were made to the restaurant, though the KFC name remained unchanged until Yum! Brands sold it to private equity firm Yum!

C: what are your strengths?<n>Output: I'm very proficient with word processing software, excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations.<n><n>Input: I'm looking for a secretary position.  It's a small agency that deals with public relations firms.   It hires only people that have experience working in the public relations field.  My goal is to be in their office by the middle of the week. My boss tells me to interview today, it won't be easy but she knows I'm very motivated. I'm just nervous because I've got some other interviews tomorrow.  I need to find something that will be challenging but not super stressful for me.  How can I prepare myself for the interview?  The interview is held every Monday at 9:30 in their office.  I don't know if I can ask this person these questions because they would not want to say no which is why they aren't sure, but what else can I ask? I need to be prepared for a lot of things; I'm also very nervous about the interview.  What are the questions I should know? What does the company care about, how much time do I have, is there a resume I need and what is their process? Is hiring a secretary very different than hiring a sales person? Would it be better to find an entry level position vs. hiring a secretary? Is it worth going to the interview?<n>Output: I asked my boss to give me 2 pages of background information on each candidate and their experience at the agency.  I would like to interview the 2 candidates again on Monday.  I asked the interviewer if she would be willing to do this before the interview, just to find out what questions I should ask and what she knows about the company.  She said it's not a problem.  I should plan on spending a lot of time researching the company.  I'm also going to write down 3-4 questions for the interview, like, is the company's salary competitive with mine or theirs or is the company hiring a sales person, a secretary or someone else?

It is illegal for anyone to sell meat except as part of the ration. They pass laws for restaurants which, from what I have seen, they have little choice about. There are few restaurants, especially those specializing in non meat dishes. There is no way for someone to get a job, even if they have education and a good work history, unless they are vegetarian.

Do you get the egg, tuna, and potato or will you be forced to eat meat?<n>Output: The government sells its citizens a diet of potato, chicken, and fish.

Choices:  A: make breakfast B: go hiking C: pack or bag D: light fire E: grab a match<n>Output:		 You can cook a lot of food for dinner easily. The ingredients do need to be carefully prepped and cooked though. The fire may be hard to find if camping for a long time though.<n>Output: For breakfast I'd need about a half hour. I'd take my time so I would cook 2 eggs and some bacon for breakfast. The bacon will need to be cooked quickly though as it will not stick to itself easily. Also, because I have to boil the eggs I will need to make some bacon first. I may cook half of the bacon and not the other half. The eggs will need to be cooked together as well.<n>For lunch I'd need another hour before I could start baking bread at home. I would need to go hunting and gather some vegetables since I need some oil to make a good spread for bread. My stove only burns for so long, so I'll need to make a large pot for this. If I don't have any oil around the camp fire I will go fetch some. Then I would need to make a nice salad for lunch.<n>For dinner I would need another 30 minutes. I could cook steaks, chicken, or fish. I could also bake a loaf of bread and have it ready in 30 minutes or so. I will need to pick some lettuce for dressing and some kind of sauce if I want to add meat. I probably will not have time do this though because of the amount of food I would need to prepare.<n><n>Input:Two women are having dinner in a restaurant. The total price of their entrees is $25, the total cost of the appetizer is $20 and the total cost of the entrees is $75.  Which of these foods is the highest priced?  Output: Appetizers are usually cheap since most people go there only to eat once. Food is expensive because the restaurants are also having lots of people in the restaurant.<n>Output: For the appetizers the women would get the salmon, which would cost $10. Salmon is also relatively low priced in restaurants, so if they were getting that for dinner it would really cost them more than just the appetizer.  The second appetizer is the shrimp pasta that is not in season now, which would normally cost $20. The last appetizer is the salmon sashimi, which would cost $15. Normally seafood is not expensive at restaurants because they are very good at preparing most seafood.  I could tell you two appetizers and two sashimi dishes at restaurants

Three fall off.  Now there are X apples."  What is this an example of? Choices:  A: park B: coloring book C: garden center D: math problem E: gravity<n>Output:		<n>a) The apple tree had 10 apples as a result of gravity<n>b) an apple tree did not produce an apple as a result of gravity  c) the apple tree is not in a garden center<n>d) the apples were taken from a garden center and the apples were made from a piece of paper<n>e) the paper did not belong to the garden center and the paper did not fall from the tree<n>f) no apple fell after it had been moved up.  If it had fallen down, the apple would break off.  The apple would just be a part of the tree.<n>Gravity and drawing pictures are two different techniques.<n>1.) Draw a circle around the apple using the surface and the area you used to draw it. The area you used to draw is the area around the line you drew in which the apple was sitting.<n>2.) Draw an ellipse around the apple since it was near the ground.<n>3.) Draw a cone around the apple since it needed a lot of space to make it appear as though it was on a circle.<n>4.) Draw a cone around an apple because you wanted an oval image, because you wanted the apple to be a part of the larger image, and because you wanted the apple near the ground since it would drop the other apples off.<n>5.) Draw a sphere around the apple since you wanted the sphere to be the whole image, not just the center.<n>6.) Draw a triangle around the apple since it did not fall off.<n>7.) Draw a trapezoid around the apple since it fell on its side. This is your triangle because you were drawing something as a rectangle.<n>8.) Draw a square and put an equal amount of fruit in the square and then draw another square and fill the square with fruit. Once the square is filled, draw another square onto top of it and fill the new square with fruit.<n>9.) Draw another triangle and fill the square with three other fruit. Again, this makes it look like the original triangle.<n>10.) Draw something round and put half the fruit under the shape and put the other half over the shape. Then draw two more circles on top of each other then draw another circle and put another fruit in the middle of another circle. Then draw one circle over and one more circle under the shape (see how it's doing?). Make an oval and put fruit in it. Now draw 1 more circle.<n>11.) Draw something circle and put half the fruit on the circle

Choices:  A: laugh B: sit C: being entertained D: math E: meet<n>Output:		 We'll do math. How many quarters would he take to buy a soda?<n>Input:Adam wants to play with his friend while he's at work. Can he get the ball at the house after work?    How does this help?       If not, can he pick up the ball at a playground outside of town?     What would you do?     How can you best help your friend while he's at the house?     Why didn't he bring the ball to work?     Would you help him at the house after work or outside of town?  Why do they do math after school?    What are Adam's choices?     Input:The first time he goes to a baseball game he can get a soda at the concession stand at the ballpark.  Now every game he goes, he has to bring his own soda.<n>output:So that is four quarters.    It isn't very much at all, but it's more than Adam has to spend when he goes the games.<n>Input:He can buy a soda at his baseball games.  He can get a soda at his concession stand at the ballpark when he wins.  Which will allow Adam to get a soda and the concession stand when he loses,  instead of spending more money at the games when he does something wrong.  Can they make this happen? If not, what should they do.    What can Adam do to keep buying his drink as a concession stand?    Input:He can bring a soda to his baseball game by spending 3 quarters instead of the one.  He can play catch (or something similar) with a friend at his concession stand every time he goes.     What should Adam do if the concession stand is empty?     If Adam buys a soda each time he plays catch, it doesn't help.     It isn’t too much for a baseball game, but at a baseball game it adds up, like you said.     Why doesn't he bring his soda to the concession stand when he wins?     He should try talking to the concession stand.  He has to ask, "Hey can I get your special soda?" and see if they'll put it in.  If they don't like you, they can easily just spit in your cup.<n>Output:How about this scenario?

This is a general definition but most people think it means to move quickly or quickly get a job. This one is more specific (in that it covers a longer scale) and is also about transportation. What is the shortest distance a person can walk between two points?<n>Output: It's hard to answer this question without knowing the definition of *quickly*. To me, fast means taking the shortest amount of time for whatever reason you have. Most transportation will fit under that definition. I think the most important thing is to determine whether you're in a situation where you're rushing versus if you're trying to get to a specific destination in a timely manner.<n>Input:What is the distance between two points A and B?<n>Output: 1.000*a = 2.000 * a = 5.000 * a = 20,000 *a<n>So a person can walk 1.000 meters in 15 seconds. Now if they need 4.000 or more minutes to walk the same distance, they are going to have to wait. So 5+a = 8.000*a = 100,000 *a.<n>So if you're on a train for a 2.000 meter journey, you need to take an average of 3,000 steps = 8.000.<n>So 8.000 x 5*a = 80,000 *a<n>The answer to the above question is 2*15 = 60<n>The final answer is 60<n><n>Input:What is a positive number?<n>Output: It depends on the situation.<n>Input:What does the value in parentheses over the answer represent?<n>Output: If you answered yes to the first question, then a negative answer reflects the negative situation.<n>Input:How many people would have to get in front of you for a car to stop in this lane?<n>Output: How many cars are there in front of you?<n>Input:What can be accomplished (in a day's time) by each of the following people in their respective careers?<n>Output: All the above<n>input:One or more.<n>input:Some.

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input:Jimmy didn't like going to the party.  It seemed like the guys there did nothing but what? Choices:  A: dance B: getting drunk C: meet new people D: having fun E: have fun<n>Output:		 He doesn't know any of the other guys.  Therefore he would have no "good behavior" points, therefore nothing will reward him.  Therefore no party! Therefore no fun!  Therefore no reward!  Therefore no party!  Therefore no fun!  Conclusion: It is not a good thing to go to the "Bad Behavior Ball."<n>Now what did the answers to the different questions tell me?<n>1. If you get points for certain actions that you perform, you would get them all. In other words, if you're a bad person, then you would get all the badges.<n>2. You have to be careful when choosing what actions to perform. Some choices have a higher chance of rewarding you, but there's also a chance they won't. For example, you could choose to play pool on Monday and win bonus points if you spend all of Tuesday playing. If you get two bonus points per day, that means that even though you're going to spend one hour on Tuesday, just doing one hour of it will earn you some bonus badges. But if you do nothing that day, then that would mean that you did nothing to earn yourself any badges. Therefore the question you just answered would have no choice but to give you no bonus points.<n>3. Since players only get badges when they reach the end of the game, this means you have to take your time. It also means that if you want to advance faster, you have to play a longer game.<n>The most interesting thing here is that the rewards come in the form of stickers, so you can't just collect them as you go. You have to earn them by performing certain actions.<n>So I guess we can only conclude that if you do well in Bad Behavior Ball, you would do even better in the other games that have stickers.<n><n>Input: The following questions are true.

They can also be rewarded when they help someone at the gym do a bad job when the work that the other members do is good. In this case there is a problem with bad work.<n><n>There are three kinds of time. 1. We spend our time working for others. 2. We steal time to save money and to make people happy. 3. We get paid for the time we spend doing good stuff.<n><n>For example, we can earn 80c an hour by stealing 1 hour worth of working time from a coworker doing good work and spending the same amount of time doing bad work for this coworker and his family. Or we can earn 30c an hour by stealing a second-half hour to prevent a problem from happening at work.<n><n>To be considered “good practice”, we need to spend a certain amount of the time we steal to make the work of a colleague and their family better. This usually comes in the form of: A. Taking someone’s half-hour and making it better B. Doing the job that someone else at work is doing C. Making an additional contribution to the coworker’s family, such as food or other small purchases.<n><n>This can be complicated by the fact that it can actually work out well for someone else to steal the half-hour. For example, if this coworker also steal 1 hour of your working time, the payout for doing this can be 80/1 = 150% in your favour. But when someone has to steal 2.5 hours of your time to improve someone else’s working time, it can be much cheaper since it will not be the result of someone’s stealing your half-hour.<n><n>It is only unfair if someone steals your whole hour. So the problem with time theft is not the fact that it results in people not spending an unearned amount of time, it’s just unfair if someone steals a whole hour.<n><n>In a similar problem

There's no stress<n>Output E: tension comes when you have too much and it is stressful. You can put in enough effort to lose, but not too much to kill yourself trying<n>Output D: stress is tension and C stands for stress.<n>Input: What is the definition of stress? When you don’t know if you’re losing or winning?<n>Output: Stress occurs when a person feels there is too much pressure on what they are trying to do. They are either stressed by their opponents who will do/say something that takes all their effort and pushes them to their limit or the pressure of society that forces them to conform in certain ways.   Stresses are often used by sports leagues to push athletes to a greater intensity, intensity that makes them want to quit.   Stress can also be caused by a person having an unhealthy mindset towards training if they can’t afford the drugs and alcohol involved so they just give in.<n>Output D: stress means the pressure to perform.    The best way to get stronger is by increasing the intensity and quantity of the exercise, or trying harder.   Staying focused during training can sometimes get in the way of performing well. The stress can arise from a poor mindset or losing the desire to be better.  Stressing out about not performing well is a form of stress.  The pressure to do well is stress.  The only thing that matters is performance.<n><n>Input: What comes from pressure and conflict between parties, the tension is what creates the stress<n>Output: The tension creates the pressure. If you don’t have tension, then you don’t work to build a pressure<n>Output: The tension may be helpful when working for goals and can sometimes keep a person focused on something<n>Output: the tensions are there because of the pressure and conflict people experience. The best way to deal with it is to deal with the problem not the tension.  And pressure in itself comes from something, so it doesn’t help in any way when you don’t get

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input:The spoiled child's playroom was massive, but only one of many rooms in the what? Choices:  A: big house B: nursery school C: preschool D: building E: retirement home<n>Output:		 The massive property has 8 bedrooms, 2 baths and enough room to expand by almost 1/2. It is also quite well equipped with plenty of storage space, a gym, wine cellar, bar and pool.  It has been rented for $3 million for the last year. The owners live only 2 blocks from the house.  How much does it cost to run the property?<n>Input: The boy has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths and one living room. The house is 7500 square feet.  The owners rent it at $7500 per month plus $30,000 a year in maintenance for the house and the lot behind it.

A day is defined as the interval from the day the mother was  a day pregnant to the  day of the calf. A calf can be  born on any day of that week. In  this case the day a calf is born (Day A) is  defined as the day of  the mother's pregnancy   to that  day. If she gave birth  to a calf at Day C, it would be  born in the morning of Day D, which is after  Day A. After all the calves are born, there will be  100 cows - 100 days later. How many days in  the previous weeks have the cows been lactating?

Therefore, the answer "A" is correct.<n>You can test the idea above with A=2 and B=1.<n><n>Input: An employee is charged by the client to do the job twice each day at a different location. The total is $50. If you pay $20 per day for the first two days, you will earn $180 before tax. If you pay $50 per day for the third day, you will earn $120 before tax.  (If you work for a company that pays taxes, which you probably do, you should add the dollar amount of tax you are liable to pay. We would be paying $300 before tax.)<n>Input: He charges an additional $20 for each morning's job.<n>output: $20-120 = $200 each<n>input: He charges $15 a day and then $10 a day to fix up his lunch. He must eat $60 before tax.<n>output: $60-120 = $48<n>output: That would leave us with $8 for rent ($48 times 2 hours=$28), food ($60),

The container has been in transit for 15 hours.  The container is at the harbor about to be unloaded for 15 more hours.  The container weighs 90 tons and is moving forward.  The container has a load of 24 containers.  How long will it be until the container arrives at the harbor?<n>Output: The most efficient way from the standpoint of a container unloader is the route where one can move the container by one hour and keep the ship/port from running back and forth the entire distance.  From the standpoint of an individual, one can move the container along the shortest course which would give the container its closest port about five times faster than if he had to cross the entire ocean.  The most efficient method of moving food would be the route of the food truck if two people wanted to move 24 containers at the same time instead of one at about eight trucks a day.  In the lorry the most efficient way to move 24 containers is to pick them all up at the same time.<n>Input: The container ship in port has a capacity of 6100 tons. The container ship is moving in port at a speed of 6100 feet per hour. What was the vessel's speed the last time it was in port?<n>Output: 6100/0.3=3200/45<n>Which speed is the best for moving a 90-ton container in an hour?<n>Input: The container container is unloaded from the ship at the harbor in port.  The container weighs 45 tons and is moving in a straight line.  The ship is moving at 11 miles per hour. What was time?<n>Output: 2 hours 45 minutes<n>Which method was the best for moving a 45-ton container in an 18-hour period?<n>Input: The lorry is unloaded at the harbor in port at a speed which matches the ship's speed.  The lorry takes six and a half hours to complete the course.  The lorry speeds in the direction of the ships which must be run to ensure that the cargo reaches its destination.  Since the lorry starts at the harbor port it will take the full 20 hours to get to the port at the other side. The lorry thus will move at the same rate as the ships for the most part.  An extra hour is cost because the lorry must take additional

Choices:  A: theatre B: fairgrounds C: friend's house D: show E: casino<n>Output:		 I suggest that you go to a show.  Why?  Well, it's not uncommon for rollercoasters and ferries to be full and full of people.  I think a more comfortable ride is much safer than being on a large Ferris wheel where there are no windows.  I understand the theatre.  However, the fairgrounds are very crowded and there is no room to stretch out.  In addition, there are few of us in this country who like the theatre.  It tends to be rather loud and a lot of men in there. As for friend's house...  I like to be around people on rollercoasters- I get a rush out of it, at least.  As for a casino...  The casinos at Hollywood and MGM are crowded and you will inevitably run into some of  the more obnoxious gamblers around there.  However, it is easy to escape them once you leave the game itself.  That means it is relatively easy for people to have fun in a casino rather than on a roller coaster or ferris wheel.  In all honesty I prefer theaters because people there are often more friendly and engaging.<n><n>Input:I own a farm in Idaho.  My favorite pastime while the cows are out is reading.  My favorite books are:  1)  The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown  2)  On the Road by Jack Kerouac 3)  1984 by George Orwell  4)  Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Quinn<n>Output:I suggest that your next activity should be to read these books.  Why? Well, you will have lots of time to do so, and you will have time to do so with other people.  Also, these books are some of the most engaging books I have ever read.  They are easy to understand, they are very interesting, and they actually feel like they were written by a few people, not a huge number.  I suggest that you read these books.  I've read all of those on your list except 1984, which was assigned to me in college as our textbook for a class in which I didn't read much literature at all.  I love that book and I highly recommend it.  Now if you would like to suggest the next book to read for your course I would welcome that challenge.<n><n>Input:Is there a website out there that can tell me which companies and products have been most successful in advertising (and thus making lots of money for the companies

Input:Car A: uses gasoline   Output:Car B: uses natural gas      Input:Car A uses gasoline    Output:Car A: requires 5 litres of gasoline       Out of these, which fuel is the right choice?<n>Output: The most efficient and environmentally-friendly fuel is the one which costs more.      Fuel:  Use fuel of the same weight and volume as the tank size, then use another 10 litres of water      Gasoline can be a cheaper option. A car containing 5 litres of gasoline needs 7 litres of water   It costs more to get gas so it will be more expensive.

The problem is, there are multiple problems, and this example has answers in paragraphs. So I split it up into two parts.  Answer 1) The total water used should be less than the water needed to cook 5 portions of spaghetti.  Answer 2) The total gallons used should be the same as the pounds of water needed for 5 portions of spaghetti (less water).  I put the answer for Answer 1 first.  Here it is:<n>5 cups of water are needed to cook 5 portions<n>Of course, using spaghetti, you don't need quite so much water. But since the question is asking for the same amount of water, answer 2 is still the closest answer. The total gallons used should actually be less than the total amount of water needed to cook 5 servings, since the total amount of water used for 5 servings is three times the total amount of water required for 5 servings of pasta sauce.  Also, the amount of energy spent to boil the water is 0.5 Kcal, instead

She can retake it at the end of the semester. The student, however,

The man and his wife were eating dinner in a restaurant. The man started to eat a small bite of his food when the server brought a tiny glass of water to the table.<n>Output: he drank 4.7 ounces of water.<n>So he drank about 4 ounces of water per day<n><n>I'm really not sure if you were aware of the fact that there are over a thousand ways to answer this.<n>You could use it as the basis of an essay, an example of how to go about the problem in the example given (which is also a good exercise), or even write something for a group project on the problem.<n><n>The problem is not limited to counting calories.<n>My girlfriend does not like to go out on dates and she likes for me to drive her there and back. She is concerned that I do not make an effort to get out of the house. We can also share stories about how many calories one would need to accomplish a specific task. We share numbers and make comments about how many miles the car is being used. I did not mean for this topic to be limited to counting calories, I see it as a tool that I can use to increase my awareness. My girlfriend is aware of my health concerns and she lets me into this world without giving me her health card information. I am aware of her anxiety over me not going out and we make an effort to go out at least once a week.<n><n>Counting calories seems like an easy thing to figure out, and you do so in every day life. If she wants you to eat healthy, she knows how many calories are in things like food, and she is aware of your concerns. If you don't go out to dinner with her once in awhile, but you do enjoy meals out with other friends, then she's going to be in more of a position to point you in the right direction.<n><n>So it seems to me that there is a more involved problem. Why does she want you to cut calories? It seems to me like she wants to know that you are aware of how many calories you have, not that you are going out and eating junk, but that she expects you to be in better shape or eat more.<n>A couple of ideas are that: 1) she wants you to become physically active so that you can control whether or not you get fat. 2

This is a 1 day difference from the estimated average of 36 days spent in America alone by people of European descent. How many days is this difference?<n>Output: 36/36.50, or 36 days, is closer to 40 than 39, so the question is off by a day.<n>Output:The average length of the US federal government is 13 months. This fact alone doesn't make you have more time to work, get through the chores, or do social stuff, but it does add up over the course of a year's worth of days.<n>Output:The median annual pay for Americans is $46,000. That is very low for living on your own. If you have an employer who pays you less and lets you do whatever you want, this is probably not a good situation. My guess: this is true of most modern working adults. So far, this is only about 50% of the population. But it's a good guess, so let's say it's true for 90% of all Americans.<n>Output:To get to a point where you don't wake up every morning wishing your day didn't end so soon, you would have to work 40 hours per week, which is about 7500 hours a year.

He will tell us that the word "friend" is used in its purest and purest form; there is no adjective attached to it and that it has no negative connotation. What is the origin of the word friend?<n>Output: "Friend" was derived from the Greek word friendos, meaning something in common or common interest. It was used when one is having intercourse with someone. After a long period of time, one was unable to use this word because of this association, and another word, friend was used by man. Therefore it is only natural that friends and partners be used in the same context as "intercourse." John will also explain that there is no reason for the negative meaning of "friend." John's first sentence ends with "Now is the time to use friend." The second sentence will be about what happened to be when one is "in" trouble.<n><n>Input:Let's suppose a football coach named Adam is out of town on an interview.

Then since she saves $3200 per child, she takes home $100, which means she can have 1 kid after 4 children.<n>Output: $100 - $4100 = $200<n>So in total she will gain $10,000 in 4 generations.<n><n>Input: The price of each kilogram of almonds, walnuts and pecans has increased $2 each since 2007. In 2009 it will cost $3.05, $3.10 and $3.55. How are the prices of the nuts affected by this increase?<n>Output: This price increase only affects the nuts. For the walnuts, however, it increases the price for a 2-kilogram package by $.90<n>(2 - a) + (2 + b) + (2 + c) + (2 + d) = (a - b - c - d) + (a - d - b) + (a - c - d)<n>Thus, the increase in the nut price is $.90/$3.05/$3.55/$3.55/$1.10/5 = $1.05<n>The higher price of walnuts affects fewer customers. Each customer consumes only 5kg. Since the price of nuts increases $1.05, the total amount consumed is $15,080. Thus the average price of walnuts is $0.05/kg, which is $20 lower than a year ago.<n>Output: $15,080 - $1.05 = $14,090<n>So each year customers consume $10,000 ($10,000/year) less than a year ago. Thus a total of $10,000 is now missing from their annual budget. This

I've got a hole in my roof, it's raining all over! I've no money and no place to stay!" "I've got a hole in the roof too!" the bird continues. "Come on inside! We can make a nest!" The other friends tried to dissuade the bird from coming but he said no and continued to play. They got him some crayons and they drawed the bird. John and his friends took their pails and started to place them on the roof. The bird was not happy about the lack of roof to stay in. So John and friends said, "Okay, when I come down I'll put down some clothes and some food." John went down and found the clothes, food and the bird's crayons. He looked at the bird and said, "What do you say we make our own roof?" "I don't want to be an artist anymore!" the bird replies. Now they have a bird's cave. John decided to invite the bird to the birthday party next week so he gave the bird the pail.

Choose from the options below: A: the coop B:  A: the hen house C: box D:  A: poultry shed  If A  D   B: poultry shed A: poultry shed D: poultry shed<n>Output:The chickens go to the coop where they sleep, eat and are usually housed. The best place to keep chickens is either on the coop or in the coop.  The coop is a perfect home for chickens that have been properly housed. The poultry shed is appropriate for animals that go out of their natural habitat and require more space.  If you keep chickens in their natural home, you can use the coop to store things such as milk and eggs, as well as items that are  too small for the house. If you keep them in the coop, do not keep them in their own pen. They would be too small or it would make the coop too small.   The poultry shed helps keep  the chickens warm when the weather gets chilly. The chicken sheds are inexpensive to build and simple to clean. They are also easy to maintain.<n>     The poultry sheds can also be the best way to provide them with food. When chickens eat chicken food (e.g. feed) they cannot go  outside, causing food to get all over the place. This mess will likely cause an illness in the chickens, but without it the chickens will most likely die.  Thus, chickens in their natural environment are  easier to care for.<n>  The poultry sheds can be  used for any family that raises chickens. Most people choose to raise chickens in the coop or the poultry sheds to have a yard full of chickens. This helps the family to enjoy the chickens rather than keep them as pets.  The chickens are not meant to be pets,  but the coop or the shed provides a  better place for them to live than the house does.<n>    Feed   The coop and the hen house supply the  birds enough food to keep them happy and healthy.<n>    Eggs   Chicken eggs provide a  source of food for the chickens. When the chickens  find  other food they become nervous,

Upon returning, all three items were missing from his pocket. When asked what he was doing, the police officer assumed that James had returned to his car after leaving home without leaving anything behind. What could he have done?? That's right, he left his car keys in his car at home - he forgot his wallet AND his phone and his phone was his phone, not his phone. Therefore it was very easy for the police to conclude that James had been on the phone as the driver, and then left home without his wallet and his phone. What could he have possibly been doing? That's right, James is a careless person, who leaves his wallet and his phone at his home to lose consciousness. What could he possibly be doing? That's right - he's stupid. What could he possibly have been doing? That's true - he took his phone with him while driving, so he could make an emergency phone call or use his phone while driving. What could he possibly been doing? That was certainly not "attempting to commit vehicular homicide". What could he possibly have committed? I don't know. He could have gone in for a kiss as if he had just got off work. He could have gone out and got something to eat. He could have stopped at a convenience store for a quick snack. What could he possibly do? That's right - they should have stopped at the McDonald's.<n><n>Input:Joe had planned to work on a computer for 12 years.<n>Output:At one time he planned on doing that for 12 hours a week for the rest of his life.<n>So Joe had a plan to work on computers for 12 years.

All of the men wish to take a month off from work.  The first two have already been given the vacation and would not take a leave, but both men want a month off.  The third man has not yet been given the annual vacation, and would not take a vacation, but all three would do so if he was given the monthly vacation.  The following table shows how the wages of each pair of paid vacation would differ from their wages today if they are given the same vacation today.  The salary increases in year one would be negligible, because vacation is only given in the last 2 months of the year.  The salary decreases in year two, because most people take vacation after the second semester of the year.  In year three, salaries remain the same as year one because the vacations are no longer needed by the third and fourth students.<n><n>Output:John wants a month off.  He tells John that he wants a 30,000 vacation. The first three reasons are not listed here as it is not needed. John adds the fourth reason.<n>John wants to take a 12 day vacation beginning May 6.  The first 3 reasons are not needed, and the last 3 reasons are.<n>First three reasons:  The cost of a vacation is $3,000.  The cost of a 10 day vacation is $10,000, and the cost of a 30 day vacation is $30,000, for a total of $10,000.  The total cost for John would be $3,000 * 3 = $60K.  The total cost of the vacation would be $60K * 3 = $120K.  Therefore, the first reason for John saying he wants a 30, 000 vacation is because there will be only 3 students, while the third reason is simply because John wants to take a vacation.<n>Second reason:  The annual salary is $30K in year three, while the cost is $120K in year one.  The total cost is $120K * 3 = $180K in year three and $150K * 3 = $170K in year one. So the first reason is to take a vacation, whereas the second and third reasons are for not taking a vacation in any case.<n>Third reason:  The vacation will go through June 7.  The

He put the bill under his desk and then proceeded to look for a countertop that would give him some protection. Which one did he choose?<n><n>Input:John is on the phone with a customer.  His customer is asking to have his company's security system installed.  John has to decide whether to install the security system himself, or if he has another company called to do it. You can only guess the answer.<n>Output: He called a company called Security Systems.<n>He called the number on the back of a bill that he didn't recognize, and left a message for the company to call him.  The company called him and confirmed that they could do the work at a price close to the quoted price, so he picked it up.<n>After he got home, he put the computer monitor on top of the bill when he sat on the couch and then read the instructions on the bill to understand how to place the power cable to the wall plug.  He turned off the computer at the end of the billing cycle, and left the monitor on top of the computer with the power button closed. When he closed his computer monitor, he unplugged the power for the power cord that was attached to it. When he read the instructions on the side of the bill, he opened a power cable on one side of the monitor, switched it to the back of the monitor, ran the cord for the monitor back to his computer, and unplugted the power from that side.  When he opened the power cable on the other side of the monitor and ran the connector from the power plug, he switched back to the old power cable. Then he shut down the computer and then put the monitor back onto his desk.  Finally, he opened the power cable connected to the monitor from the other side of the panel and ran the connector from that side to his computer and shut down his computer when he closed it.<n>You have to guess the answer by solving the following math problem.  Solution:<n>2 * $60 * $10 = $200<n>2 * $80 * $30 = $600<n>2 * $120 * $20 = $900<n>2 * $250 * $30 = $900<n>The number $900 is wrong because it is larger than the number $900. That is, because he charged $900 for four different jobs, the cost of that job is the same whether he has $300 or $450 in his bank

And yes for answer two (buses) its just because there are a bunch of people in the bus and you would also need to look at it twice, and answer in both questions if you want to.<n>the first question is the reason why i split it in two questions, i didn't realise at first -  so i split it the way i've decided to in most of the questions - just thought i would help. I will definately work on my English on the blog!<n>thanks for the feedback i really want the feedback on here as i like being appreciated!

I have a 5' ficus about 15ft tall on a desk in my office.   It's not very bright because it's close to the window...  But it doesn't smell bad.  It's in a glass pot, but I don't water it for at least 6 weeks.  The thing does have lots of leaves so it's not getting so little water that it's drying up and going to fall out.   The leaves are more yellow than green, which I like.  When you look at them they're not perfect and don't have a great shape, but even so...  It's never looked less like a ficus than it does.   It's been here for a while, maybe a yr or more now.  Maybe a few weeks more, but not many.  Still...  it doesn't look like a ficus.      Any takers??

He lived with his children because he didn't want to go where? Choices:  A: republican party B: old people's home C: office D: park E: high school or college<n>Output:		 C since he lives with the seniors who vote republican. D and E because they go to the office<n>So, in total, he votes Republican every four years<n>But now imagine that every time he votes, he is voting only for a specific person<n>In that case, his voting behavior is like the election of a special candidate<n>In a nutshell, we would have his vote for the Republican candidate instead of his vote for the person.<n>But there is still someone worse than the candidate. He would vote for the democrat instead. However, when he votes for a democratic candidate, he would only do so against the Republican.<n>That's because he thinks that the Democratic candidate is the best option. However, it's not true. The first two options are equally good with one being slightly better. So the voters only need to choose one.<n>But if you look at the voting behavior before and after the election, we would discover that voting isn't always like that. A candidate who gets no votes becomes the favorite because the Democrats would vote for him. This happens even when the candidate was only slightly less harmful.<n>So our simulation would have his vote for an even worse candidate instead. However, when you give him the choice of voting for an even worse candidate, he doesn't because he thinks that he does like the first two options better than the third option.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input:What might someone do who is having fun? Choices:  A: being happy B: glee C: smoke D: stress relief E: may laugh<n>Output:		 Being happy = 60/180=<<60/180=6>>6 hour a week = 9 work hours<n>So a 9 hour work day is a little over one work week<n>So an 8 hour work day is a lot less<n>So a 3 hours work day is less over 1 work week = only 1 hour each day<n>So in other words, his fun is over<n>So the final answer it that he is sad and doesn't really enjoy his work = he doesn't do much fun at work = he doesn't make any money = he has the worst life.  So the final answer is -3<n><n>Input: You go on vacation to a tropical island. After a few days of relaxation, you feel tired and begin to sleep more. Your job requires you to remain alert all the time. Where does that leave you?<n>Output: Felt tired = 60/6=<<60/6=24>>24 hours rest = 12 work hours<n>So in other words you go on vacation = 12 hours of rest = 60 hours of effort<n>Which means that you are less effective = you spend extra effort = you are more tired or need to sleep = you feel less relaxed = you feel more tired = you have more stress<n>So the final answer for day 2 of vacation it = 30 * 24 = 120 hours of effort / 120 hours of recovery / 120 hours of sleep<n>So an extra hour of effort is over 6 work hours<n>Which means that you work 9 hours a week = 50 work hours a week<n>So an extra hour work = a 1.5 days of vacation = 4 work days<n>So your vacation cost 3 days of work = 3.5 times 9<n>So your vacation only cost 3 days = $1,600<n>However, that doesn't account for the increased stress on vacation = you spend more time overworking = you save more time, so your vacation cost 5 days = $6,000.<n>So the end cost of a 3 day vacation is $6,000<n>Also, the end cost of a 10 day vacation is $11,000, so it would cost about $20,000 at 30 days of vacation. This shows that a 10 day vacation is more than twice as expensive.<n>But the end cost of a 30 day vacation is $33,000, so it doesn't show the exact increase in stress = it doesn't show the direct spending of vacation. So the total cost of a 30 day trip is about $65,000<n><n>Input: What is

He was hired to do 30 hours a week of tutoring after summer school this year.  He works 5 days a week, in addition to 30 hours a week of classes this year.  How big of a financial loss will this result in?<n>Output: A will lose $3000 per month or 2.5 years<n><n>Input: A had no choice but to work in the same field for 15 years when he graduated from high school.  How was his earnings impacted by that?  Output: His earnings were impacted by one period in time only.  Let us say that one period cost him $2000 and that his income was $1500 for the year. Assume that the income is $1500 for the year at 75% of normal, or $7500 at minimum wage. So he makes his annual $1500 living wage before taxes of $1400. He lives on $1500 per month.    He also was required to take an entry level position.  Let us say he worked a 40h shift at $10/hr.   He would take home about $80 per month if he worked there for two years and averaged a 15 hr shift a week.   However, he does not do that.  He takes an entry level position at $13.25/hr, instead.   he is paid $200 less a month ($600 per month total). His earnings for the year are now $450/mo more ($1500 total). This is a net savings of $200/mo. That is a $3000 difference in a year. Assuming that wage is enough to buy him a house of their own, the savings over that period of years would be $4500.    Which means that A would not have to work for 15 more years at this job in order for it to be sufficient to purchase the same house.   A would have to work only 5 years or less to be at that point.  That point is $18,000.   If he worked for a company that paid a reasonable wage (e.g. $10/hr), he could afford to live after a year of saving on his own.   After 6 years or less, he would be back to having more savings by buying the same house.  So, the amount saved is $36,500 over 15 years or so?<n>Output: A would have had

Then every year one would get a new car.  John decided to do one of his sons each year so every year he’d get a new car and take them to the house and the house to the car.  John decided he would do this until his first born was 27.  That’s when he switched gears and gave his first son a new car each year while his second son continued receiving the old one until he was 47.  That’ll save them $5,000+ a year. John then gave the last two sons a car each year.  The oldest son who is 42 received the same car for 48 years until the youngest son who is 21 received the car for his 21st birthday<n>Output: John made $45,000 this year after deducting taxes, insurance, and fuel. His son took home $25,000+ after deducting taxes, but then their expenses totaled $26,000 because they went out to dinner twice a week, to the movies twice a week and used the gym three times a week.<n>So the final output was $23,000<n><n>Input: John lives with his wife Jane and their four sons in their home. Jane works from home and also is their primary caregiver.  Jane is currently the only person providing education for her boys, so she spends a significant amount of time at home.  But for the next few years Jane expects to be home full-time when her youngest becomes high school dropout at age 26, leaving him with no adult to assist him financially.  His oldest son now works as the primary support for his family.  His middle son is a full-time college student, so he takes up the additional work at home. Jane continues to work as well.  The first three sons work hard during school while spending extra time at home. They each earn a small monthly pension that John pays into until he’s 90.<n>Output: John made an average of $23,000 this year after including taxes, insurance and fuel.  It is $23,000 less than he expected.  His son took home $15,

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n>Output:		 If you choose to stay the course rather than yelling back (and that includes taking parenting cues from the parent) then your children will have fewer of the responses above.  When you yell back, you express your dissatisfaction. When you take parenting cues from the parent, then they get upset that you are not giving full attention to them.  These two actions ultimately cause the children to act out more.<n><n>Input:The first question asks children “What do you think happened to the dog/cat?” and then proceeds to state which family member you think caused the dog/cat. The second question asks children “Why do some parents let their child have more food compared to others?” The third question asks children “How do you respond to people who say you are just wasting food?” The final question asks children “Do you think it’s rude for someone to ask you if you still want to eat after you just had a huge meal?”<n>Output: Each time the questions are answered differently than expected, the child is more likely to experience frustration, anger, stress, and/or depression.

He earns $1 per hour.  He then saves $1 per week to pay off his mortgage and get back to work.<n>Output: Adam has $700.00 of credit to open a new savings account at his local bank.  He spends $200.00 each week on groceries.  He saves $200.00 each month to pay off his mortgage or save up for another purchase.  He earns $280.00 per month per house, so $600.00 per month total.  Therefore, Adam has saved $600.00 per year to pay his mortgage.<n>He spends 50% of that $600.00 in food  $300.00 worth every month  $200.00 each year<n>That means Adam only has $300.00 of food left to buy.  He has $180.00 on his mortgage.  Therefore he must save $180.00 per month to cover the remaining $300.00<n>In order to make Adam save an additional $180.00 per year on food he decides to start a blog.  He writes a post describing how much he spends per month on food.  Within 3-days of starting the blog, he will have saved $150.00 from his savings account to buy food.  Therefore, he will have saved an additional $150.00 per month from now until the end of last year.  Therefore, to pay off his mortgage, he must save $150.00 from now until the end next year.  Therefore, he must spend an additional $150.50 per month from now until next year.  Therefore he will need to save an additional $150.55 per month from now until June 2011.<n>That means for every $150.00 Adam saves now, he needs to save an additional $90.00 from now until June 2011<n>So once again, for each $150.00 Adam gives up, he needs to give up an additional $90.50<n>Therefore, Adam will need to give up $360.00 a year<n><n>Input:  Adam works for a public hospital and works 12 hours per day.

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input:Where can you store a small notepad on your person? Choices:  A: back pocket B: meeting C: drug store D: home E: school<n>Output:		 A is the correct answer. A wallet is usually worn by men for brief periods of time but not while working out. A drug store is the only choice that is practical. A keychain would be awkward as it would be too short to be able to secure a small notepad on. If you're into keys, though, you could do a custom solution to this problem.<n>Input: If you do not wish to carry your smartphone, what would you use for storing phone information on your person? Choice: A: A plastic tag or chain<n>Output: A is correct. Phone information is valuable because of its convenience in a number of situations. You could either use a plastic tag or a key chain but this would probably ruin the aesthetics of your gym bag.<n>Input:Which would you rather use in an emergency (I.e. an earthquake)? Choice: A: a cellphone, a flashlight or a book of matches (since a flashlight needs electricity)<n>Output: A is not correct but you might think otherwise, since it was the first choice given. A cellphone would be an option because it has a power supply to keep it on throughout an emergency. It could also be a book of matches to keep with it.<n>Input: What is the least important thing you carry in your gym bag? Choice: A: water B: towel C: towel D: keychain E: a bag of chips<n>Output: A is right. For most of us it is probably a towel, some warm clothes and a keychain. It should be noted that you may not carry any of these items in your gym bag. In order for them to be effective they need to be accessible. You may or may not carry them in your gym bag depending on what you need during an emergency.<n>Input:What is your preference when picking socks?

I think there is an issue with how you worded it.<n><n>Yes, I made the last statement for the sake of keeping interest for the following questions.<n><n>1\. I cannot imagine what a happy, healthy adult life with no stress would feel like.  I imagine that with so many other factors (e.g. work, family) one would want to stay as active as possible to take advantage of any extra health that comes from it.<n><n>This is probably an error of judgement on my part. I see where your point is coming from, but there are many ways to get to that "happy, healthy adult life" for many people. For most of the questions I would have to guess that it's because they would feel free from those other burdens. So yes, being healthy is a huge plus, but I would also imagine that a lot of people would try to make the best of the situation they find themselves in. But yes, the main "goal for most" must be to not lose said health because the primary burden is having too little.<n><n>I would like to see a study of whether or not one's feelings, or your overall attitude about the situation (perhaps via what you said above) affect whether or not the civil action is taken.<n><n>I would agree. That would be fascinating!

Two kilogram of nuts costs 15 cents each and 2 kilogram of dried fruit is cost 8 cents (2.5 times the price of nuts). Adam takes the money and buys 3 * 15 = 36 * 40 = 60 * 60 = 135 dollars. So Adam spends 180 dollars in just one place. Adam takes the money and buy 6 * 40 = 120 * 120 = 240 dollars in the town. This is enough to buy a house on his farm. He then spends the remaining 220 dollars on building a small house in the town. He builds a small fence around his house and a small shed on his lawn. His sheep have a small hut in the pasture outside. His cows are housed inside the barn. Adam now sets up his store where he sells his goods and takes in donations, and begins the process of paying off the mortgage on his farm (60 dollars a month for 6 years in rent). The only thing he needs to do now is to buy some furniture for his farm store. Adam then spends the remaining 60 dollars for a bed, 3 chairs, 2 tables and some wooden plates and dishes.

Choices:  A: pharmacy B: person C: drugstore D: bedroom E: mcdonalds<n>Output:		 A: pharmacy B:  person C:  drugstore D:  bedroom E:  mcdonalds<n>So the final answer for the question is 1<n><n>I think you are wrong. The answer must remain 3. If the first question only deals with the direct question of how to answer the questions above, the answer for the following question must remain 3 too.<n><n>2. For a person to use two hands to work at a computer screen, does one hand have to touch the screen or only the keyboard?  A: Both hands B: Only a single hand C: Both hands D: Only a single hand<n>Output: As long as they are touching the keyboard they can use both hands<n><n>I think you may be right. The answer should be 2, since when John is holding a book in one hand, and reaching for a pen, he is using both hands simultaneously. However, the answer to the first question for a person to move a computer with two hands, is 3. I think the answer for that question would remain 2.<n><n>Click to expand...<n><n>Yes, that was my guess, but I was hoping to get some clarification on it. Thanks!<n><n>You are correct that the answer is 2 with the exception that there is always a computer with at least a keyboard. There always has to be some amount of movement required - otherwise, someone who cannot use one hand well would never be able to do a computer task with enough proficiency to work effectively.<n><n>However, there are other considerations, such as being able to type with one hand, etc.<n><n>What this means is that you are correct that the answer to the second question is 3.<n><n>But that's the answer, right?<n><n>It doesn't mean anything if one hand gets used anyway. That is why it is better to think of the questions as "what are some tasks that are always performed using all hands". So, it needs to be "all hands" that need to touch the keyboard at some point. If those hands don't have to touch the keyboard, then neither of the remaining hands has to touch the keyboard.<n><n>So it isn't that you don't have an option. You do. But that's not why it has to be 3 - it has to be 3 * every one uses the keyboard at some time.<n><n>You are correct I was wrong when I asked about option 2. I had 2 questions instead of 1. All hands using keyboards, each of them

Choices:  A: birds B: action C: butterflies D: happiness E: anxiety<n>Output:		 For bird selection let's assume 1 bird = 1 day = 1 hour. Let's further assume that 1 day does not include breakfast, lunch and dinner. Thus, the bird receives a total calories of 35.5 calories each day. The only expenditure of calories that bird consumes is for the consumption of water per day. Thus, the bird will have total expenditures of 65 calories during any single day. The other options do not include the water requirement.<n>Finally, let's assume that the birds feed only during the daytime. So let's assume that it takes about 4 hours a day for a bird to eat.<n>Thus, the birds receive a total of 35.5 calories per day. Thus, on average, the birds will receive 35 calories per day each session. Also, the birds consume 14,280 calories per year during an average year. This is approximately 9-11,140 calories per bird.<n>Finally, let us assume that the birds feed their own young. Thus, let us assume that during the average day they receive around 1.5 grams of sugar, one gram of protein (from the other bird or fruit), one gram of fat (from the fruit as well as the same bird), one gram of carbohydrate (from sugar which is free), and one gram of calcium. These foods together represent a total calories of 2700, which is roughly 4.24 grams of sugar, 1.12 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat and 3.52 grams of carbohydrates.<n>Thus, the total calories of a bird and its young represent 47,600 calories.<n>Thus each child receives 47,600 calories per year.<n><n>Input:For this experiment, suppose that there were two people in your circle, and both are very good at eating and very bad about cooking.

Playing the heavier games is for the more seasoned people, but not everyone is going to like the games. You should play the games that engage and interest the people who will play with you.  Most of the people at work just want to go home and watch the news. That's not even a competitive game. If you want to play a competitive game go to a casino and play cards against humanity.<n>Output: You should pick cards that give you an edge but you shouldn't make your deck too full or heavy. You should play games that are like people play when they are at church. You should have a conversation with the people who you play with in order to improve your game. People who play with others will know what you like and when and how often you play. You should want to spend your time playing the game with people who want to play with you.<n>Output: Cards that give an edge are fine if you want to win. However you should never play a game that is too difficult. If the game is too hard you will never make it to the end without some kind of trouble, and if you don’t make it through you can never see the end.<n><n>To sum up:  A: very strong.

One is a woman known for her generous spirit and another is a very cautious, careful man. They decide it is fitting in order for themselves to be together that one should take the risk of going into the ocean in order to save the rest of the passengers. Both must decide which of the two can do this most effectively. Each must then decide together which of them is most likely to survive. The following is what they both must figure out.  Input:Choose the two people who you believe will survive based on which of the following categories they fall under(a, b, c etc.):a) generous person b) cautious person c) cautious person d) cautious person e) generous person  Output:For the man and woman,it would appear that the woman has better chances of surviving while the man has a better chance of surviving based on several different categories.  But if there is some unknown about this man or woman that is a possibility, then i'd give the man a better chance since there is some uncertainty in his situation so it might be a higher probability he survives. So the woman has less chances of surviving due to several uncertainties but since there is none for the man,the woman has a better chance of survival based on the several different categories listed above.  But that said, both must still get one of the 2 seats so a better than average person can get one of the two seats. Hence we shall not answer the question. So the final answer will be B.<n><n>Input:An average person is known for their generosity. They would be called what?

You each pay $.75.  Each food purchase has an interest charge of 3% and so costs $2.25.  If you spend $1.00 each time then all of you will see a profit (plus the interest) of $1.75=$1.75*5=$4.50.  If you can each bring home a full-price item then you make $15.

How much people burn wood depends on what kind of wood they burn. How much wood people burned for cooking depends on where they burned it. If cooking happens in a wood stove in the same building as the kitchen and the stove is not moved, wood can burn indefinitely. But a fire can quickly get out of control if it heats one or both rooms too quickly. Wood stoves are also easy to steal because cooking smells so good. This problem can be resolved by keeping the burning area completely dark.<n>Input:A typical household water bill represents the cost of water service used to clean and treat the water.

Choices:  A: conduct trial B: arrest C: bring in verdict D: pass sentence E: serve justice<n>Output:		 What can be inferred from this question? That a judge does conduct trials and arrest. It also mentions that he can bring someone in for trial as well as give a verdict. How is the question worded? If not, what should the question be worded as?<n><n>In your country, what is the penalty if the man is found guilty of stealing his wife's belongings? In this case the penalty was imprisonment for 15 years (I think) but what if the man did not take the belongings? In that case he would be fined 3/3 of the value of her belongings. Now what if the man did take the belongings? What would the penalty be for not taking it?<n><n>What is the difference between a "penalty" and a "fine"?<n><n>A penalty is something that people can pay. A fine is not something like a wage or something. A penalty is worth more than a fine.<n><n>Fines differ from a penalty in that they are usually set amounts like 2/3 of the value (and sometimes less than that) and then there is the matter of a sentence (which is more of a punishment than a fine).<n><n>In which of these sentences was a sentence less than a "fine" and which one was more than a "fine"?<n>1. A sentence of 2/3 of the money spent. This means 2/3 of the "fineness" of the item.<n>...and in the cases that the sentence was actually a fine, the amount was so much less than the value of the item, that they were even considered a "penalty".<n>2. A sentence of 2x the maximum amount possible for the crime - this can be a sentence like a one year conditional sentence, or a sentence like a 6th degree sentence.<n><n>A fine must be paid by the recipient or the court, not necessarily the person convicted. As I understand it, a fine can be any monetary amount one is allowed to pay. The difference is who pays it and whom gets it.<n><n>In what situation would a fine need to be paid to someone other than the person who brought the fine - if he paid it himself and the money came from some kind of government fund for victims?<n><n>The punishment must come from the government and the victim. In some (I'm sure there are many) ways the punishment may be a fine, a prison sentence, a tax, a fine in the amount of the price of the item, or maybe even just a deduction

If it ends quickly then it probably isn't that special. But if it goes long and ends with someone saying "I don't really feel like doing this" then that usually is a sign of a good relationship.  Good dates with really great people take time, and usually you can tell if one really has a good relationship with someone. If they don't laugh at each other when jokes are made, then it's probably not a good relationship. If one says that one "needs a break" after dating for a few months, then don’t waste your time with the one. If you don’t want to do the things the other person does but still want to hang out then that is a good relationship. It's kind of like dating, but at the same time, a relationship in this case is more like work. It's different than just talking to someone over text or email.  A good relationship requires time to get to know each other. If one is going to be in a relationship for a long time then getting to know each other, figuring out their interests, etc should be part of the entire process.<n>A good relationship is also going out, doing something together, etc. A simple date is fun for a lot of people, but after a while you really don’

I was wondering:  I would like to schedule a few more sessions with [the person in charge of recruiting students] if you’re open?  I’m in town this weekend through Saturday.  [If not, what time are you available on Friday?]”<n>So, in the first round you ask the receptionist where he/she will be at a certain time.  In the second round, then, you choose the receptionist based on who is in the most likely venue and then work your way from there.<n>In the third round you don’t even ask the receptionist where the meeting will be, because that would mean that you were trying to set it up with him/her.  Instead, you simply say “Hey, I’m in the office [the person will be in the office [the receptionist]] and I was wondering:  Would you like to meet with me on Monday [in the office.]”<n>If you have asked too many questions about the person in charge, then you have done it wrong.  There are many different scenarios where you should ask the person in charge.  In general, then, the questions you should ask are:  1) “Is there a time that would be convenient for you?”  In general if you get a “time that would be convenient for [person in charge]” and can’t figure out what it is, then you should stop there and go from there.  This is true even if the person is asking you a specific day and time.  Asking for a specific date is a better idea in most situations.  Then, in the fourth round, you ask how many questions you asked in each round.  If the answers include “5” or less, then you should stop and go from there.<n><n>Input:Adam is driving down the freeway in a car that cost $40,000.  Adam bought a car from Nissan for $25,000.

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input:Where would you put silverware once they've dried, but you're not ready to use them. Choices:  A: table B: restaurant C: cupboard D: kitchen E: sink<n>Output:		 Put them on to clean up A or B C D or kitchen<n>(Note that a number of people would put their silverware on a table in the UK, so I'd have to make a note in my British version of this question.)  Alternatively:  Put them on a shelf.<n><n>Input: When Adam comes back home, he uses a lot of the nuts and dried fruit in his kitchen. They stay there for a while, but are not all used when he uses them.  If he puts all the nuts and dried fruit on the table when he gets home, how many days will it take for all the nuts to be used?<n>Output: That depends, depending on how many days he uses the nuts and dried fruit. If he gets them all out at the same time, then he uses them all right away. If he uses some for a while, then he's not done for that day. So it may take about a week for Adam to use all of his nuts and dried fruit.

I don’t think the “correct” way to learn is to try to do it in the real world.

I know this question appears to be phrased as if you get perfect answers on all six questions but this is false.<n>If the questions are all correct then people will not be labeled as perfectionists, so it's fair to say that "perfecte[d]t" will not always be the name used for a person at a given time.

You are not allowed to ask the seller who your bank account belongs to so that it will appear in your bank statement.  The seller also needs  $200 up front or the transaction will be canceled. The $200 up front,  $4000 in goods or services,  the value of the car or truck is all based on agreed upon values. Your bank account belongs to your account and the terms are the agreed upon value of such goods or services. At the end of each day, you report for duty and taxes. You then pay the taxes but you do not receive the goods or services in exchange. How many days would each part take?  Output: Days<n>The answer is 7.  In a country with only 1 tax it takes about 8 days to collect the taxes by the bank and pay the seller.  But if the buyer pays taxes, and the seller pays sales taxes, then it takes only 8 days. But if the seller also pays a sales tax (VAT), then it takes 9 days to complete the transaction but if the seller also pays taxes, then it takes 9 days.  So in this instance, the seller needs to pay sales tax or the transaction will not be completed.<n><n>Input: A farmer is offered a cow for $2000.  He takes the cow from the seller.

Input:The first time he goes to a baseball game he can get a soda at the concession stand at the ballpark.  Now every game he goes, he has to bring his own soda.\noutput:So that is four quarters.    It isn't very much at all, but it's more than Adam has to spend when he goes the games.\nInput:He can buy a soda at his baseball games.  He can get a soda at his concession stand at the ballpark when he wins.  Which will allow Adam to get a soda and the concession stand when he loses,  instead of spending more money at the games when he does something wrong.  Can they make this happen? If not, what should they do.    What can Adam do to keep buying his drink as a concession stand?    Input:He can bring a soda to his baseball game by spending 3 quarters instead of the one.  He can play catch (or something similar) with a friend at his concession stand every time he goes.     What should Adam do if the concession stand is empty?     If Adam buys a soda each time he plays catch, it doesn't help.     It isn\u2019t too much for a baseball game, but at a baseball game it adds up, like you said.     Why doesn't he bring his soda to the concession stand when he wins?     He should try talking to the concession stand.  He has to ask, \"Hey can I get your special soda?\" and see if they'll put it in.  If they don't like you, they can easily just spit in your cup.\nOutput:How about this scenario?", "answer": "E: meet"}

This is a general definition but most people think it means to move quickly or quickly get a job. This one is more specific (in that it covers a longer scale) and is also about transportation. What is the shortest distance a person can walk between two points?\nOutput: It's hard to answer this question without knowing the definition of *quickly*. To me, fast means taking the shortest amount of time for whatever reason you have. Most transportation will fit under that definition. I think the most important thing is to determine whether you're in a situation where you're rushing versus if you're trying to get to a specific destination in a timely manner.\nInput:What is the distance between two points A and B?\nOutput: 1.000*a = 2.000 * a = 5.000 * a = 20,000 *a\nSo a person can walk 1.000 meters in 15 seconds. Now if they need 4.000 or more minutes to walk the same distance, they are going to have to wait. So 5+a = 8.000*a = 100,000 *a.\nSo if you're on a train for a 2.000 meter journey, you need to take an average of 3,000 steps = 8.000.\nSo 8.000 x 5*a = 80,000 *a\nThe answer to the above question is 2*15 = 60\nThe final answer is 60\n\nInput:What is a positive number?\nOutput: It depends on the situation.\nInput:What does the value in parentheses over the answer represent?\nOutput: If you answered yes to the first question, then a negative answer reflects the negative situation.\nInput:How many people would have to get in front of you for a car to stop in this lane?\nOutput: How many cars are there in front of you?\nInput:What can be accomplished (in a day's time) by each of the following people in their respective careers?\nOutput: All the above\ninput:One or more.\ninput:Some.

{"text": "He doesn't know any of the other guys.  Therefore he would have no \"good behavior\" points, therefore nothing will reward him.  Therefore no party! Therefore no fun!  Therefore no reward!  Therefore no party!  Therefore no fun!  Conclusion: It is not a good thing to go to the \"Bad Behavior Ball.\"\nNow what did the answers to the different questions tell me?\n1. If you get points for certain actions that you perform, you would get them all. In other words, if you're a bad person, then you would get all the badges.\n2. You have to be careful when choosing what actions to perform. Some choices have a higher chance of rewarding you, but there's also a chance they won't. For example, you could choose to play pool on Monday and win bonus points if you spend all of Tuesday playing. If you get two bonus points per day, that means that even though you're going to spend one hour on Tuesday, just doing one hour of it will earn you some bonus badges. But if you do nothing that day, then that would mean that you did nothing to earn yourself any badges. Therefore the question you just answered would have no choice but to give you no bonus points.\n3. Since players only get badges when they reach the end of the game, this means you have to take your time. It also means that if you want to advance faster, you have to play a longer game.\nThe most interesting thing here is that the rewards come in the form of stickers, so you can't just collect them as you go. You have to earn them by performing certain actions.\nSo I guess we can only conclude that if you do well in Bad Behavior Ball, you would do even better in the other games that have stickers.\n\nInput: The following questions are true.

{"text": "Unfairness, fearfulness, and poor quality\nSo the final answer would be 1 to 2 to achieve the desired outcomes.\n\n(** Note: There are several levels in this problem and a problem with no clear answers.**)\n\n1-4 Answers\n1\n\nIn this problem, people can be rewarded when they spend 1 hour in the gym doing bad work.\n\nBut they are not always rewarded when they spend 60 minutes in a gym doing good work that other members do. They can also be rewarded when they help someone at the gym do a bad job when the work that the other members do is good. In this case there is a problem with bad work.\n\nThere are three kinds of time. 1. We spend our time working for others. 2. We steal time to save money and to make people happy. 3. We get paid for the time we spend doing good stuff.\n\nFor example, we can earn 80c an hour by stealing 1 hour worth of working time from a coworker doing good work and spending the same amount of time doing bad work for this coworker and his family. Or we can earn 30c an hour by stealing a second-half hour to prevent a problem from happening at work.\n\nTo be considered \u201cgood practice\u201d, we need to spend a certain amount of the time we steal to make the work of a colleague and their family better. This usually comes in the form of: A. Taking someone\u2019s half-hour and making it better B. Doing the job that someone else at work is doing C. Making an additional contribution to the coworker\u2019s family, such as food or other small purchases.\n\nThis can be complicated by the fact that it can actually work out well for someone else to steal the half-hour. For example, if this coworker also steal 1 hour of your working time, the payout for doing this can be 80/1 = 150% in your favour. But when someone has to steal 2.5 hours of your time to improve someone else\u2019s working time, it can be much cheaper since it will not be the result of someone\u2019s stealing your half-hour.\n\nIt is only unfair if someone steals your whole hour. So the problem with time theft is not the fact that it results in people not spending an unearned amount of time, it\u2019s just unfair if someone steals a whole hour.\n\nIn a similar problem", "answer": "C: criticism"}

It's more a question of pressure and conflict. Pressure to get something done that's against what you're fighting for is tense\nOutput E: tension means no tension. There's no stress\nOutput E: tension comes when you have too much and it is stressful. You can put in enough effort to lose, but not too much to kill yourself trying\nOutput D: stress is tension and C stands for stress.\nInput: What is the definition of stress? When you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re losing or winning?\nOutput: Stress occurs when a person feels there is too much pressure on what they are trying to do. They are either stressed by their opponents who will do/say something that takes all their effort and pushes them to their limit or the pressure of society that forces them to conform in certain ways.   Stresses are often used by sports leagues to push athletes to a greater intensity, intensity that makes them want to quit.   Stress can also be caused by a person having an unhealthy mindset towards training if they can\u2019t afford the drugs and alcohol involved so they just give in.\nOutput D: stress means the pressure to perform.    The best way to get stronger is by increasing the intensity and quantity of the exercise, or trying harder.   Staying focused during training can sometimes get in the way of performing well. The stress can arise from a poor mindset or losing the desire to be better.  Stressing out about not performing well is a form of stress.  The pressure to do well is stress.  The only thing that matters is performance.\n\nInput: What comes from pressure and conflict between parties, the tension is what creates the stress\nOutput: The tension creates the pressure. If you don\u2019t have tension, then you don\u2019t work to build a pressure\nOutput: The tension may be helpful when working for goals and can sometimes keep a person focused on something\nOutput: the tensions are there because of the pressure and conflict people experience. The best way to deal with it is to deal with the problem not the tension.

The house cost $250K, but includes a 10,000 sq f ft lot with the price of the house being $250K+$1,000,000+$1,250,000> $1,250,000.  The total sale price of the house for $325,000 means he paid $20,000 above list price (plus $17,500 for the lot that included the house).   What is his monthly payment?\nOutput: The homeowner got about $20K on his home.  He paid $250K for the house and paid $20,000 for the lot.

If John sells $7.50 worth of milk, then how many gallons of milk will he sell to families if John sells $100 worth of milk?\nOutput: $7.50 * 100^5=$19,125\nSo John will sell 19.5 gallons of milk if he sells $100 worth of raw milk\nSo the final answer for his milk sale is 19.5 gallons of raw milk (grams per gallon) = 19.5 ^ 883 = 519 kg (Grams)\nSo $19,125*5 = $11,025,000\nA total of $11,025,0000 was sold in one sale\nThe final price for the milk was $8.25/gallon, so the final total price for the gallon of milk was  $8.25", "answer": "A: original"}

The university enjoyed a strong economy and saw many positive effects from the new funding.\nOutput:The university saw many positive effects from their new funding but their main benefactor was not around.\nOutput:The money that had been donated was not able to cover the expenses of the university building so they had to cut the funding.  Many students lost scholarships and programs were cut.\nOutput:The Big town now is known as the worst town of America.  This was a direct result of the new fund giving.\nOutput:Since that fund giving the Big town has seen more positive effects than ever before.  The city has been named as one of the best towns in America.  The university has been granted all new funding.\nOutput:(the new fund giving, more funding, city, positive, etc.) =(Big town) \u2013(the negative, not so many positive, negative consequences) =(the university) \u2013(the other effects) =(the new benefits of funding) =(the negative consequences) =(local community) =(beneficiaries) =(financial) =(consequences) =(big community) =(benefits) =(prosperities)\nOutput:If you are an expert in something then how will you describe that \"something\"?\nOutput:To describe something you MUST know several things about.

Each night he goes to bed around 8:00 hours, and goes to work around 11:00 hours. In order to do this, he needs to see the TV shows available. Therefore, he has a \"DVR\" system in the room which he watches whenever he has free time.\nOutput: He spends 2 hours watching TV each night >2 hours watching TV per day (total 12 hours) >2 hours watching TV each night.\nSo he spends 72 hours watching TV - or 12 hours a week = 8 hours a day >8 hours a week.\n\nInput:Jane and her family are friends with Bill a musician whom she sees at Jane's friend's wedding. She invites Bill to dinner.\nOutput: Bill will go home with Jane to his apartment and he will stay there for the night. He will not stay long and will go back to his hotel to call his car and drive back from Jane's wedding.

The container has been in transit for 15 hours.  The container is at the harbor about to be unloaded for 15 more hours.  The container weighs 90 tons and is moving forward.  The container has a load of 24 containers.  How long will it be until the container arrives at the harbor?\nOutput: The most efficient way from the standpoint of a container unloader is the route where one can move the container by one hour and keep the ship/port from running back and forth the entire distance.  From the standpoint of an individual, one can move the container along the shortest course which would give the container its closest port about five times faster than if he had to cross the entire ocean.  The most efficient method of moving food would be the route of the food truck if two people wanted to move 24 containers at the same time instead of one at about eight trucks a day.  In the lorry the most efficient way to move 24 containers is to pick them all up at the same time.\nInput: The container ship in port has a capacity of 6100 tons.

What was time?\nOutput: 2 hours 45 minutes\nWhich method was the best for moving a 45-ton container in an 18-hour period?\nInput: The lorry is unloaded at the harbor in port at a speed which matches the ship's speed.  The lorry takes six and a half hours to complete the course.  The lorry speeds in the direction of the ships which must be run to ensure that the cargo reaches its destination.  Since the lorry starts at the harbor port it will take the full 20 hours to get to the port at the other side. The lorry thus will move at the same rate as the ships for the most part.  An extra hour is cost because the lorry must take additional", "answer": "A: port"}
{"text": "I suggest that you go to a show.  Why?  Well, it's not uncommon for rollercoasters and ferries to be full and full of people.  I think a more comfortable ride is much safer than being on a large Ferris wheel where there are no windows.  I understand the theatre.  However, the fairgrounds are very crowded and there is no room to stretch out.  In addition, there are few of us in this country who like the theatre.  It tends to be rather loud and a lot of men in there. As for friend's house...  I like to be around people on rollercoasters- I get a rush out of it, at least.  As for a casino...  The casinos at Hollywood and MGM are crowded and you will inevitably run into some of  the more obnoxious gamblers around there.  However, it is easy to escape them once you leave the game itself.  That means it is relatively easy for people to have fun in a casino rather than on a roller coaster or ferris wheel.  In all honesty I prefer theaters because people there are often more friendly and engaging.\n\nInput:I own a farm in Idaho.  My favorite pastime while the cows are out is reading.

Input:Car A: uses gasoline   Output:Car B: uses natural gas      Input:Car A uses gasoline    Output:Car A: requires 5 litres of gasoline       Out of these, which fuel is the right choice?\nOutput: The most efficient and environmentally-friendly fuel is the one which costs more.      Fuel:  Use fuel of the same weight and volume as the tank size, then use another 10 litres of water      Gasoline can be a cheaper option. A car containing 5 litres of gasoline needs 7 litres of water   It costs more to get gas so it will be more expensive.

What is the right amount of fuel needed to heat the stove and boil the water used for cooking?\nOutput: Three times the weight of the water for 5 seconds. Two times the water for 1 minute, 3 times the for 8 seconds, 5 times for 10 seconds,  6 times for one minute, 7 times for two minutes.\n\nThis question was a part of a class I had a few weeks ago, and I was asked to help write the answer based on how the examples were worded. The problem is, there are multiple problems, and this example has answers in paragraphs. So I split it up into two parts.  Answer 1) The total water used should be less than the water needed to cook 5 portions of spaghetti.  Answer 2) The total gallons used should be the same as the pounds of water needed for 5 portions of spaghetti (less water).  I put the answer for Answer 1 first.  Here it is:\n5 cups of water are needed to cook 5 portions\nOf course, using spaghetti, you don't need quite so much water. But since the question is asking for the same amount of water, answer 2 is still the closest answer. The total gallons used should actually be less than the total amount of water needed to cook 5 servings, since the total amount of water used for 5 servings is three times the total amount of water required for 5 servings of pasta sauce.  Also, the amount of energy spent to boil the water is 0.5 Kcal, instead", "answer": "A: villa"}

She is concerned that I do not make an effort to get out of the house. We can also share stories about how many calories one would need to accomplish a specific task. We share numbers and make comments about how many miles the car is being used. I did not mean for this topic to be limited to counting calories, I see it as a tool that I can use to increase my awareness. My girlfriend is aware of my health concerns and she lets me into this world without giving me her health card information. I am aware of her anxiety over me not going out and we make an effort to go out at least once a week.\n\nCounting calories seems like an easy thing to figure out, and you do so in every day life. If she wants you to eat healthy, she knows how many calories are in things like food, and she is aware of your concerns. If you don't go out to dinner with her once in awhile, but you do enjoy meals out with other friends, then she's going to be in more of a position to point you in the right direction.\n\nSo it seems to me that there is a more involved problem. Why does she want you to cut calories? It seems to me like she wants to know that you are aware of how many calories you have, not that you are going out and eating junk, but that she expects you to be in better shape or eat more.\nA couple of ideas are that: 1) she wants you to become physically active so that you can control whether or not you get fat. 2", "answer": "B: bedroom"}

This is a 1 day difference from the estimated average of 36 days spent in America alone by people of European descent.

Then since she saves $3200 per child, she takes home $100, which means she can have 1 kid after 4 children.\nOutput: $100 - $4100 = $200\nSo in total she will gain $10,000 in 4 generations.\n\nInput: The price of each kilogram of almonds, walnuts and pecans has increased $2 each since 2007. In 2009 it will cost $3.05, $3.10 and $3.55. How are the prices of the nuts affected by this increase?\nOutput: This price increase only affects the nuts. For the walnuts, however, it increases the price for a 2-kilogram package by $.90\n(2 - a) + (2 + b) + (2 + c) + (2 + d) = (a - b - c - d) + (a - d - b) + (a - c - d)\nThus, the increase in the nut price is $.90/$3.05/$3.55/$3.55/$1.10/5 = $1.05\nThe higher price of walnuts affects fewer customers. Each customer consumes only 5kg. Since the price of nuts increases $1.05, the total amount consumed is $15,080. Thus the average price of walnuts is $0.05/kg, which is $20 lower than a year ago.\nOutput: $15,080 - $1.05 = $14,090\nSo each year customers consume $10,000 ($10,000/year) less than a year ago.

{"text": "The eggs are held in a basket placed on a shelf by the kitchen  A: box B: chicken coop C: egg carton D: henhouse\nSo the correct answer is B!\n\n### Input:After bringing chickens home from the coop where do they stay? Choose from the options below: A: the coop B:  A: the hen house C: box D:  A: poultry shed  If A  D   B: poultry shed A: poultry shed D: poultry shed\nOutput:The chickens go to the coop where they sleep, eat and are usually housed. The best place to keep chickens is either on the coop or in the coop.  The coop is a perfect home for chickens that have been properly housed. The poultry shed is appropriate for animals that go out of their natural habitat and require more space.  If you keep chickens in their natural home, you can use the coop to store things such as milk and eggs, as well as items that are  too small for the house. If you keep them in the coop, do not keep them in their own pen. They would be too small or it would make the coop too small.   The poultry shed helps keep  the chickens warm when the weather gets chilly. The chicken sheds are inexpensive to build and simple to clean. They are also easy to maintain.\n     The poultry sheds can also be the best way to provide them with food. When chickens eat chicken food (e.g. feed) they cannot go  outside, causing food to get all over the place. This mess will likely cause an illness in the chickens, but without it the chickens will most likely die.  Thus, chickens in their natural environment are  easier to care for.\n  The poultry sheds can be  used for any family that raises chickens. Most people choose to raise chickens in the coop or the poultry sheds to have a yard full of chickens. This helps the family to enjoy the chickens rather than keep them as pets.  The chickens are not meant to be pets,  but the coop or the shed provides a  better place for them to live than the house does.\n    Feed   The coop and the hen house supply the  birds enough food to keep them happy and healthy.\n    Eggs   Chicken eggs provide a  source of food for the chickens. When the chickens  find  other food they become nervous,", "answer": "D: egg carton"}

You never take a loan if no payments are due right now. Paying your sister\u2019s debt is something you need to do only when you have the money and it will cost you the least amount of money to do that.

{"text": "A\n\ninput:The table below shows three men each being paid $100.50 a week for a two week vacation, and an annual vacation of $30,000.  All of the men wish to take a month off from work.  The first two have already been given the vacation and would not take a leave, but both men want a month off.  The third man has not yet been given the annual vacation, and would not take a vacation, but all three would do so if he was given the monthly vacation.  The following table shows how the wages of each pair of paid vacation would differ from their wages today if they are given the same vacation today.  The salary increases in year one would be negligible, because vacation is only given in the last 2 months of the year.  The salary decreases in year two, because most people take vacation after the second semester of the year.  In year three, salaries remain the same as year one because the vacations are no longer needed by the third and fourth students.\n\nOutput:John wants a month off.  He tells John that he wants a 30,000 vacation. The first three reasons are not listed here as it is not needed. John adds the fourth reason.\nJohn wants to take a 12 day vacation beginning May 6.  The first 3 reasons are not needed, and the last 3 reasons are.\nFirst three reasons:  The cost of a vacation is $3,000.  The cost of a 10 day vacation is $10,000, and the cost of a 30 day vacation is $30,000, for a total of $10,000.  The total cost for John would be $3,000 * 3 = $60K.  The total cost of the vacation would be $60K * 3 = $120K.  Therefore, the first reason for John saying he wants a 30, 000 vacation is because there will be only 3 students, while the third reason is simply because John wants to take a vacation.\nSecond reason:  The annual salary is $30K in year three, while the cost is $120K in year one.  The total cost is $120K * 3 = $180K in year three and $150K * 3 = $170K in year one.

The number of items in your set is then $n.\nAssume that there is only a single random number out of $n. It is the number $i$ in the list $n$.\nNow, what is the probability that the number $i=1$ will be chosen before any other number in the list?\n\nThe answer is\n[+]1.\nThis implies [\u2212]1<\u22122<\u22123<=5<6> = 1 and [\u2212\u00bd<\u2212\u00bd<\u22121<\u22121<\u2212=5<\u2212=2<\u22126<=7<\u22128> ] = 2.\nOf course, 5 is the only one of the $6$ items given away.

D and E because they go to the office\nSo, in total, he votes Republican every four years\nBut now imagine that every time he votes, he is voting only for a specific person\nIn that case, his voting behavior is like the election of a special candidate\nIn a nutshell, we would have his vote for the Republican candidate instead of his vote for the person.\nBut there is still someone worse than the candidate. He would vote for the democrat instead. However, when he votes for a democratic candidate, he would only do so against the Republican.\nThat's because he thinks that the Democratic candidate is the best option. However, it's not true. The first two options are equally good with one being slightly better. So the voters only need to choose one.\nBut if you look at the voting behavior before and after the election, we would discover that voting isn't always like that. A candidate who gets no votes becomes the favorite because the Democrats would vote for him. This happens even when the candidate was only slightly less harmful.\nSo our simulation would have his vote for an even worse candidate instead. However, when you give him the choice of voting for an even worse candidate, he doesn't because he thinks that he does like the first two options better than the third option.

Your job requires you to remain alert all the time. Where does that leave you?\nOutput: Felt tired = 60/6=<<60/6=24>>24 hours rest = 12 work hours\nSo in other words you go on vacation = 12 hours of rest = 60 hours of effort\nWhich means that you are less effective = you spend extra effort = you are more tired or need to sleep = you feel less relaxed = you feel more tired = you have more stress\nSo the final answer for day 2 of vacation it = 30 * 24 = 120 hours of effort / 120 hours of recovery / 120 hours of sleep\nSo an extra hour of effort is over 6 work hours\nWhich means that you work 9 hours a week = 50 work hours a week\nSo an extra hour work = a 1.5 days of vacation = 4 work days\nSo your vacation cost 3 days of work = 3.5 times 9\nSo your vacation only cost 3 days = $1,600\nHowever, that doesn't account for the increased stress on vacation = you spend more time overworking = you save more time, so your vacation cost 5 days = $6,000.\nSo the end cost of a 3 day vacation is $6,000\nAlso, the end cost of a 10 day vacation is $11,000, so it would cost about $20,000 at 30 days of vacation. This shows that a 10 day vacation is more than twice as expensive.\nBut the end cost of a 30 day vacation is $33,000, so it doesn't show the exact increase in stress = it doesn't show the direct spending of vacation.

He works 5 days a week, in addition to 30 hours a week of classes this year.  How big of a financial loss will this result in?\nOutput: A will lose $3000 per month or 2.5 years\n\nInput: A had no choice but to work in the same field for 15 years when he graduated from high school.  How was his earnings impacted by that?  Output: His earnings were impacted by one period in time only.  Let us say that one period cost him $2000 and that his income was $1500 for the year. Assume that the income is $1500 for the year at 75% of normal, or $7500 at minimum wage. So he makes his annual $1500 living wage before taxes of $1400. He lives on $1500 per month.    He also was required to take an entry level position.  Let us say he worked a 40h shift at $10/hr.   He would take home about $80 per month if he worked there for two years and averaged a 15 hr shift a week.   However, he does not do that.  He takes an entry level position at $13.25/hr, instead.   he is paid $200 less a month ($600 per month total). His earnings for the year are now $450/mo more ($1500 total). This is a net savings of $200/mo. That is a $3000 difference in a year. Assuming that wage is enough to buy him a house of their own, the savings over that period of years would be $4500.    Which means that A would not have to work for 15 more years at this job in order for it to be sufficient to purchase the same house.   A would have to work only 5 years or less to be at that point.  That point is $18,000.   If he worked for a company that paid a reasonable wage (e.g. $10/hr), he could afford to live after a year of saving on his own.   After 6 years or less, he would be back to having more savings by buying the same house.  So, the amount saved is $36,500 over 15 years or so?\nOutput: A would have had", "answer": "A: georgia"}

Then every year one would get a new car.  John decided to do one of his sons each year so every year he\u2019d get a new car and take them to the house and the house to the car.  John decided he would do this until his first born was 27.  That\u2019s when he switched gears and gave his first son a new car each year while his second son continued receiving the old one until he was 47.  That\u2019ll save them $5,000+ a year. John then gave the last two sons a car each year.  The oldest son who is 42 received the same car for 48 years until the youngest son who is 21 received the car for his 21st birthday\nOutput: John made $45,000 this year after deducting taxes, insurance, and fuel. His son took home $25,000+ after deducting taxes, but then their expenses totaled $26,000 because they went out to dinner twice a week, to the movies twice a week and used the gym three times a week.\nSo the final output was $23,000\n\nInput: John lives with his wife Jane and their four sons in their home.

His oldest son now works as the primary support for his family.  His middle son is a full-time college student, so he takes up the additional work at home. Jane continues to work as well.  The first three sons work hard during school while spending extra time at home. They each earn a small monthly pension that John pays into until he\u2019s 90.\nOutput: John made an average of $23,000 this year after including taxes, insurance and fuel.

{"text": "A: pharmacy B:  person C:  drugstore D:  bedroom E:  mcdonalds\nSo the final answer for the question is 1\n\nI think you are wrong. The answer must remain 3. If the first question only deals with the direct question of how to answer the questions above, the answer for the following question must remain 3 too.\n\n2. For a person to use two hands to work at a computer screen, does one hand have to touch the screen or only the keyboard?  A: Both hands B: Only a single hand C: Both hands D: Only a single hand\nOutput: As long as they are touching the keyboard they can use both hands\n\nI think you may be right. The answer should be 2, since when John is holding a book in one hand, and reaching for a pen, he is using both hands simultaneously. However, the answer to the first question for a person to move a computer with two hands, is 3. I think the answer for that question would remain 2.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nYes, that was my guess, but I was hoping to get some clarification on it. Thanks!\n\nYou are correct that the answer is 2 with the exception that there is always a computer with at least a keyboard. There always has to be some amount of movement required - otherwise, someone who cannot use one hand well would never be able to do a computer task with enough proficiency to work effectively.\n\nHowever, there are other considerations, such as being able to type with one hand, etc.\n\nWhat this means is that you are correct that the answer to the second question is 3.\n\nBut that's the answer, right?\n\nIt doesn't mean anything if one hand gets used anyway. That is why it is better to think of the questions as \"what are some tasks that are always performed using all hands\". So, it needs to be \"all hands\" that need to touch the keyboard at some point. If those hands don't have to touch the keyboard, then neither of the remaining hands has to touch the keyboard.\n\nSo it isn't that you don't have an option. You do. But that's not why it has to be 3 - it has to be 3 * every one uses the keyboard at some time.\n\nYou are correct I was wrong when I asked about option 2. I had 2 questions instead of 1. All hands using keyboards, each of them", "answer": "C: drugstore"}

{"text": "For bird selection let's assume 1 bird = 1 day = 1 hour. Let's further assume that 1 day does not include breakfast, lunch and dinner. Thus, the bird receives a total calories of 35.5 calories each day. The only expenditure of calories that bird consumes is for the consumption of water per day. Thus, the bird will have total expenditures of 65 calories during any single day. The other options do not include the water requirement.\nFinally, let's assume that the birds feed only during the daytime. So let's assume that it takes about 4 hours a day for a bird to eat.\nThus, the birds receive a total of 35.5 calories per day. Thus, on average, the birds will receive 35 calories per day each session. Also, the birds consume 14,280 calories per year during an average year. This is approximately 9-11,140 calories per bird.\nFinally, let us assume that the birds feed their own young. Thus, let us assume that during the average day they receive around 1.5 grams of sugar, one gram of protein (from the other bird or fruit), one gram of fat (from the fruit as well as the same bird), one gram of carbohydrate (from sugar which is free), and one gram of calcium. These foods together represent a total calories of 2700, which is roughly 4.24 grams of sugar, 1.12 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat and 3.52 grams of carbohydrates.\nThus, the total calories of a bird and its young represent 47,600 calories.\nThus each child receives 47,600 calories per year.\n\nInput:For this experiment, suppose that there were two people in your circle, and both are very good at eating and very bad about cooking.

However you should never play a game that is too difficult. If the game is too hard you will never make it to the end without some kind of trouble, and if you don\u2019t make it through you can never see the end.\n\nTo sum up:  A: very strong.

But if there is some unknown about this man or woman that is a possibility, then i'd give the man a better chance since there is some uncertainty in his situation so it might be a higher probability he survives. So the woman has less chances of surviving due to several uncertainties but since there is none for the man,the woman has a better chance of survival based on the several different categories listed above.

Now what if the man did take the belongings? What would the penalty be for not taking it?\n\nWhat is the difference between a \"penalty\" and a \"fine\"?\n\nA penalty is something that people can pay. A fine is not something like a wage or something. A penalty is worth more than a fine.\n\nFines differ from a penalty in that they are usually set amounts like 2/3 of the value (and sometimes less than that) and then there is the matter of a sentence (which is more of a punishment than a fine).\n\nIn which of these sentences was a sentence less than a \"fine\" and which one was more than a \"fine\"?\n1. A sentence of 2/3 of the money spent. This means 2/3 of the \"fineness\" of the item.\n...and in the cases that the sentence was actually a fine, the amount was so much less than the value of the item, that they were even considered a \"penalty\".\n2.

{"text": "The koala is in the garden of the Australian Outback\nThat's the best one\n\nInput: The zoo put a giraffe in the same area as the otters. How did that make it easier?\nOutput: The otter's tail has a thicker part and a thinner part, the giraffe's tail has a thicker end and a thinner end, and the giraffe's tail is a different length. The giraffe and otter tails are equally large\nSo the giraffe isn't in the same area as otters\nThat's a bad answer\n\nQuestion:The koala is kept in a room with a computer and a video player. The giraffe is kept in the jungle with a small screen and a computer. What is the distance from the computer to the giraffe's mouth?\nOutput: The kookaburra is in the garden of a tropical rainforest.\nThat's an easy one, the giraffe will be close if it has a screen (which shouldn't be much), but the kookaburra will always be at a far distance from the monitor (which should be much).\n\nQuestion: The zoo lets you pet the koala. Which animal do you think it is most like?\nOutput: The orangutan is the closest because it has a trunk, but it's still not the most like the koala, the kangaroo would be close because of its tail and the armadillo is another close one because of its hands\nSo the least like the koala it is the orangutan (not including the kangaroo which has a long tail so it's the longest animal)\nThat's good, they're only animals\n\nQuestion:The zoo has four rhinos. How many giraffes can they keep?\nOutput :\nThere are 4 giraffes\nThe giraffes are all near each other and you can pet one, as a giraffe needs a lot of space.\nNow the most giraffes they can keep is 4!\nNot a good answer to the question, the real answer is that the giraffes are a bit far away, even though I think the giraffe's are closer, it can be hard to tell from the photo since they don't have a big face to view.\n\nSolution:\nThe animals that I think are closest are the giraffes, the otters, and the orangutans.\nThe zoo should do the giraffes", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

You are not allowed to ask the seller who your bank account belongs to so that it will appear in your bank statement.  The seller also needs  $200 up front or the transaction will be canceled. The $200 up front,  $4000 in goods or services,  the value of the car or truck is all based on agreed upon values. Your bank account belongs to your account and the terms are the agreed upon value of such goods or services. At the end of each day, you report for duty and taxes. You then pay the taxes but you do not receive the goods or services in exchange. How many days would each part take?  Output: Days\nThe answer is 7.  In a country with only 1 tax it takes about 8 days to collect the taxes by the bank and pay the seller.  But if the buyer pays taxes, and the seller pays sales taxes, then it takes only 8 days.

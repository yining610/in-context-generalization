This question can be applied to many different situations in life.  I think it is time we start educating our children about food and how eating and how sleep interdepend upon each other.\n\nInput: One year your brother spent 3.5 days sleeping on the cold ground while his mother and two sisters worked 5 days working in the fields.  During this period, he ate all the food produced from the family and had only 50$ left over in his pocket each day to buy other things.  He slept in the dirt for all 5 days and still came home hungry and in need of food.  What would make him want to sleep more, and what would make him think about the money he had left over each day?\nOutput: If you knew that you earned $50 each day, would you be glad to have $50 each day or hungry for more food?\nSo even though he earned $50 each day and used about half of that, he would still have to use the rest of the money to buy the things that he needed.  Would that change his thinking if he knew that $50 was a day that he could have easily made $200 doing an ordinary chore?  Would he change his thinking about the food he was spending all day to pay for, or would he still think that spending $50 to earn $200 was a waste, and then go home hungry the next day?\nSo, if you know the answer to this question and you are willing to work to get that answer in front of your child, I would encourage you to work with them as a team to discuss the many ways that food and sleep depend on each other.\n\ninput: What was the last time the person you loved most came to mind?

Therefore, if John is renting a car for $300.00 a year, that means that he loses $300.00 on each new car he buys.\nThus, his new rent payment will be equal to the net difference between renting and purchasing a new car.\nSo John\u2018s net monthly rent will be equal to the difference between renting and purchasing the new car.\nThus, his net monthly rent will be greater than his net monthly income.\nSo his net monthly income will be lower than", "answer": "D: venice"}

Since the total payments are two $3650, the total amount of money Jennifer spent was $8,000.  Thus the total square footage of James and Jennifer\u2019s house at yale was $16/3650 = 16/8 = 10,000.\nThus the total square footage of their new house at the time of purchase was $30,000/9,000 = $80,000/80 = $240,000.\nSince both houses were used as rental property, Jennifer moved out and paid back $180.00/day for her rent for all of the time that James and Jennifer lived in that house.  Consequently, she paid back $180/day for all that time.  Since that was $180/day the total amount of money she spent on the house at the time Jennifer purchased it was $240,000.00.

The company sends 2 x 13 = 51 each year for an annual total of $1300.00 to each employee. The company pays for the employees food each month and one month only the employee is allowed to leave the company for a funeral.  If the employee doesn't attend a funeral, the company doesn\u2019t pay the funeral costs.  Suppose that, in January 2000, the company sends 27,000 envelopes, each sending $5.00.  By sending 27,000 envelopes the company makes $15.00. By sending 51 envelopes the company makes 45.0\nTotal: 45/27,000 = 45.0\nTherefore, the final answer is 45", "answer": "C: office"}

There are some really important challenges of farming such as the amount of time it takes to grow crops and to manage and plan for the harvest, but you never really get enough time to enjoy the fruits of your labour.  There are some other challenges of farming such as dealing with pests, disease, and weather.  Finally, there are some challenges in farming that are unique to farmers.  One of the primary challenges in farming is dealing with animals and the ability to maintain the health of those creatures.  The other main challenge in farming is managing your work load and keeping a schedule.  All of those challenges are unique to farming, but there are other challenges in farming that are specific to this profession.  For example, some areas of farming require a lot of attention and management.  The other major challenge in farming is the pressure to make profits from your business.  Most farmers, however, don't like to focus on making profits so they never really worry about making profits.  The most important challenge in farming, however, is being able to grow enough food to feed everybody on this planet with no other option.  It\u2019s no wonder that this is the most hardworking job on this planet.  If you had a $10 million fortune would you devote a day of your life to farming?  If you were going to build a farmhouse, which part would you add: the roof, the attic, the first floor basement, or the basement?  Who would you make the biggest sacrifice for: the children in your family or the land you farm on?  Which one would you prefer: your wife or your kids?  Which one would be the hardest to sell?  Which one would pay the highest price? Which one would have the least impact?  Which kind of foods would you grow?\nEach day would be full of new challenges and problems.  So which one would you choose?\n\nInput: It\u2019s Friday and you have a date with a hot girl at the bar and you", "answer": "A: depressed"}

How many fans did Jane and Joe spend buying?\nOutput: In all three cases they spent $40.00 each.\nIncluding this model, Jane and Joe spent $200.00.\nIncluding the Air Conditioner 2, Jane and Joe spent only $100.00.\nSo the final fan bill would be $50.00 and that does not include the Air Conditioner 2\nSo the final fan cost is $100.00 and that does NOT include the air conditioner\nSo the final fan is $100.00 divided by three = $50 + $0.50 * $100.00 * $200.00 = $50\nSo the final fan only makes the air conditioner $50, not more than $50, and therefore it leaves them with a positive end of year savings.\n\nInput: A new restaurant opened in town.

Because there are 15 loaves in the dough, there will be 150 loaves of dough.  Because the loaves are 150 in the dough, 300 = 150*15 = 150\nSo Jane will make 150*150 = <<150+150=2500>>2500\nSince the dough has only 250 calories, the actual weight of the bread is 2500.\nSo the final number is 2500\n\nInput: The sun hits the sky and casts a shadow. From the east, the sun moves westward at 45 minutes per day while remaining still at the same place in the sky. From the west, the sun moves eastward at 45 minutes per hour while remaining still at the place in the sky. What is the length of time, in hours, the sun and moon will be in the sky?\nOutput: It's hard to determine because the light is blocked by thick clouds.  In the past it would have been 2 hours until the sun came down if it were at the east but now we don't know how long the sun and moon will stay in the sky.  Also there is a storm nearby.  It will be hard to see the sun but if the clouds clear we may be able to see the moon.\nSince it's hard to determine the exact end of the day, it's better to keep track of the moon from the east.  The moon will not cast a shadow on the ground but the shadow cast by the moon will travel approximately 25 degrees to the west (from the east).  In the eastern sky, the moon will begin going eastward at 4 pm and will stop at 6 pm.\nThus, the shadow cast by the full moon is 25*1/2*3/(4-6) = <<25*1/2*2/(4-6)=75>>75.\nSo the final length of the night is 75\n\nInput: The government gave out 100 cards that were loaded with different amounts of money from $0.01 to $500.

{"text": "You'll want to throw the rock across the river at the highest point possible with the strongest force you can get.  The strongest force you can get is probably a lot stronger than the force you can get from throwing the rock at a mountain range.  So if you want to move the rock across the river, you would want to throw the rock from the mountains or in the valley since at the higher points and bridges don\u2019t have very strong forces.  You may want to throw from the ground because it's the simplest way to make a splash.  If you want to make something big splash, from water, you would want the rock to be thrown from a mountain since the strongest surface of water is on the upper reaches of a mountain\nThis example may help you better visualize the force a rock has at any certain height.  Also, imagine throwing a rock from the highest point and the lowest point.  How much force does the rock throw at the height of the peak?

On a boat, the air level is 200 feet low and 100 feet above the ocean floor.  One hundred feet above the plane of the water is the bottom of the ocean.  One hundred feet over the ocean floor is the surface of the sea.  What is the oxygen concentration at the bottom of the ocean at which one can breathe?\nOutput: The oxygen concentration at the bottom floor is 0.6(0.6=1.0) cubic feet\nIf the sea level is 400\u2032 then one can breathe 200 cubic feet from the air level at the bottom without expending any effort because the level is so low.  At sea level, the lowest level on the ocean floor is 1.0.\nIf the ocean level is 500\u2032 then one can breathe 300 cubic feet of air from the top of the sea level at the ocean\u2019s depth.\nIf the ocean is 1,000\u2032 then one can breathe 1,600 cubic feet of air.\nSo the oxygen levels at the bottom of a body of water are dependent on the oxygen pressure at its level.\nSo if there is no oxygen at the bottom of the water, the surface level remains low and the oxygen pressure stays high.\n\nInput:It was a hot day in June, about 100 degrees.

Where are the surviving four people?\nOutput: The distribution of survivors among the remains is:\nA: dead B: alive C: alive D: dead\nIn the Tenerife crash the dead are 1=<<1=25>>25 survivors\nOnly 4 survived the crash and of those 4 only 2 survived the plane crash so the survivors were 1/25 =<1/25=1>>1 survivors\nThus, 1 survivor represents 1 survivor and 1 survivor represents 1/25.  Thus, the remaining survivors represent 1 survivor and 1/25 =<<1/25=1<<25=]1survivors\nThus, only 1 survivor represents 1 survivor so the survivor represents 1/25==<<1/25 ==25\nThus, 10 survivors remains represents 10 survivors which, when combined with the 6 survivors from the Tenerife crash has 10 survivors so the survivor represents 10.  Thus, the total survivors represent 70 survivors.\nOutput: 70 survivors = 70 survivors\n10 survivors represents 70 survivors\nIn the TenerIFE crash 20 survivors were dead and 50 survivors were alive\nThus, a total of 40 survivors survived.\nOutput: 30 survivors = 40 survivors\nSince the survivors had a total of 60 survivors, 20 survivors represent 40 survivors, which is what is left when you subtract all of the bodies.\nThus, 60 survivors represents 60 survivors which, when combined by all of the bodies, result in 100 survivors.\nOutput: 100 survivors = 60 survivors\nSo the survivors were 60+60+10+50=100 survivors which is the number of survivors after all of the bodies have been collected\nThus, total survivor represents 100 survivors=100 survivor\n\nInput: A man has 40 workers to build his garage.

If they are forced to put the ice packs on their tooth they will probably cry.  However, after about ten minutes of ice packs their tooth will stop hurt.

The aspirates in the word are: i, e, d, e, th.  When it comes to the alphabet, we have to remember that if you change the order of the a\u2019s to the s\u2019s, then we get the word \u201cassumption.\u201d  This is an example of this: the letter A with capital i sounds like a \u201csh\u201d. The first word \u201cass\u2019nation\u201d sounds like the letter i.  The second word \u201cassignment\u201d sounds like the i.  Example: the letter a with capital i sounds like the s.  Therefore, the letters i & s can interchangeably be used if you take the letter m out of the word.  These letters are the vowel sounds in the word \u201cass.\u201d  When we make the vowel sounds in a word it is called a vowel shift.

In her previous job as a housekeeper, Alice earned money in three to five days. In her current job as a nurse, she earns $2.35 per hour. She earns $2.35/ hour in her previous job.

Since her total savings of $2,100 in 1993 is equal to the amount she earned in her former job and her total in her current job only equals the amount that she will need for two years of mortgage payments, it will take her approximately 11 years to buy her home since in 1993 she saved $1,500 and since she has $2,100 in her current job she will have to save $1,500 in the last year to get her home purchase in 1993.

He was working on this building and she helped him move two pieces of lumber to the next room.  They were using a hammer and he has the one hand.  They had 6 screws left on the top and 6 on the bottom but they needed to drill them.  At this point in time it was still 8:30 so how many screws did they need?\nOutput: 6\nEach time they drilled a hole there was a drill bit on either side of it.\nSince they had 6 screws in the top and 6 on each side of it, they needed to drill 6 holes.\nSo one more hole would be 3.\nIf you divide 3 by 6 that would be 3/13 = 4.83.\n\nInput:What is \u201cthe more the merrier principle\u201d?\nOutput: One more hand means: 3 more fingers.\nSince each finger has 12 bones and only 6 thumb bones, it equals twelve bones which equals 23 bones divided by 6 and that means there are no more thumps left.\nBut the more the merrier principle says there is always left over.\nThat is because there must be some unused parts.\nThey\u2019re going to use them to make clothes because there are a total of twelve people in this family.\nThey had a total of twelve people.\nTherefore an extra piece of paper with 123 on it was needed.\nIf you divided 123 by 123 that was 3/18 = 6.\nThe number of people and the number of things used in an action, equal the amount of work which in time equals the amount of labor which equals the amount of work times 12 divided by 6 and you get the amount of work.\nSo if they had an extra piece of paper, and took time to make something the number of people would multiply and the number of things would divide and the amount of labor would then multiply by 12 divided by 6 and that is how many more people can take part.\n\nInput:Jack walks down a street, and is approached by a man who is making music from two guitars.\nOutput:\n12=23\nTherefore, 12 x 23 = 93\nThus 93*12 = 47333333", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

What is the real number of people attending the wedding?\nOutput: The real number of people going to this wedding is: 300\nThat\u2019s 360 x 100 = 3900\nTherefore, the real number of people at the wedding is 3900\n\nInput:Joey has been living in his grandmother\u2019s house for three years.  It\u2019s an easy neighborhood to get around in and a great place to raise a family.  To celebrate Joey\u2019s family moving into their own home, he rents some rooms in the house for about 100$.  For those who will come over, he wants a big welcome party.  In order to pay for this party, he takes 100% of the proceeds.  For instance, if Joey receives 100$ per month from rent, he will collect 100$ per month.  Now if the house has 12 beds in it, he will need 12 beds to celebrate the party.  Since the number of people attending the party is 12, they will need 12 beds to accommodate everyone.  Since the party costs 60$ per person, which is 15% of 10,000$ to rent the house, he will need $6000$ to cover the party.  Since 60$ is equal to $120, he needs to collect $200 to cover the party. Therefore, he will need $720 to cover the party.\nInput:Joey takes $160 for the party to cover the rent, his share of the rent.  Therefore, he has raised $160 to pay the expenses.  For Joey to pay $1200 to rent 5 bedrooms in a house, he needs $1200.\nThat\u2019s $1200 x 12 and he needs $2400\nSo the final amount will be $2000\n\nInput: If you take the number of people attending a basketball game in a season, then multiply that by the number of games and then divide that by 12, that\u2019s the number of games you can play during the season.

The program was designed to help low-income families with jobs.  A parent may file a tax return that indicates that his or her child: has been unemployed for six months, has applied for benefits on behalf of his or her child, has received benefits and has made payments under the tax credit, with no more than two of the five points in the tax return being for false information. In this way the child cannot be shown in the tax return as qualifying for the credit.\nAn unemployed parent who files this return can get the credit of $500 paid to the child, and additional credits of $1,000 per year.  One point of the return is for a family that has no deductions, or other benefits which are reported in the returns filed.  The parent of a child who is unemployed can file a tax return which indicates that the child was either out of work for 6 months or has received benefits for six months. The credit available is paid, and the child must have made payments under the credit, no more than two of which were for false information. If there have been no deductions, or other forms of claims, this is a false return, and the credit would be claimed regardless of whether the child ever received benefits. Because so many children are eligible, the tax credit is also used to help families pay for other financial needs (the credit is not available to anyone who pays taxes in other ways).  If a family receives the credit and it is used to pay for such expenses as rent, food, gas, utility bills, etc., the child is not counted as being unemployed under the law. The individual tax returns of these children are not affected by the tax credit.  Because of the fact that unemployment is high, the tax credit, together with other measures, has helped families with unemployment issues.  The credit is available to anyone who is unemployed for a combined 12 months, and there is no restriction on the amount of benefits. A person with the credit in a year is considered to have been unemployed for those 12 months. Because there are so many families claiming the credit, and with so many eligible children, the parents can often get the credit for their child for no reason at all, such as owing money,", "answer": "C: get drunk"}

When Katie went back to buy the potatoes she found that the potato seeds had grown taller than Katie's height.  Katie took the time to plan what she wanted to do:  when she saw a potato plant growing taller than she was, she decided that she would plant potato vines under the potatoes in order to reduce the amount of time it took for the potatoes to grow.  However, she also decided that she would plant the potato vines on a hillside in an area that was not too hot.

Katie wanted the potatoes to grow quickly so that she could be home by 9:00 p.m. to see her parents.  The problem was that Katie wasn't used to planting potatoes and she was worried that the plants would not survive in the heat.  Katie spent two hours planting each potato vine and did not want to wait until the end of the day.  Katie was worried that if she planted the stems to close together the plants would die.

However, she realized that he would choose the blue painted butterfly and that she would lose money.  She asked both buyers if they would like to do the painting for free since he had helped her with the painting.  He said no and she had to charge him $125.00.  She asked him how much he wanted to pay for the painting and he said, \"Five dollars.\"  She thought that was fair so she paid him $125.00 and told him to ship the painting to the buyer.  The buyer was pleased with the painting so he called Kelly to see how they felt about the painting.  She was pleased with the way the painting looked and now she is wanting to ask if she can do the painting again with an inexpensive alternative of paint.  However, she still believes that he would have chosen the white painted butterfly.  How much does he feel that she got for the painting?\nOutput:  Kelly only charged $125.00 for the painting and she has to charge him $125 because she only painted 1/1=<<1/1=125>>125 to him.  If he painted it himself it would have cost him $125.00 plus $35 shipping.\nIf he paid 5 dollars then it would have cost him 5*125.00=$125.50\nSo the final answer would be $125\n\nInput: A young girl who was selling food items is given 3.

(it will include the path taken by the tornado and the path taken by the wind during the tornado\u2019s path.)\nOutput: The area covered is 3.5 miles = <<3*3=9.5>>9 miles\nFrom the area covered, 3*3=<<3*1=12>>12 miles\nFrom the area, 12*3=<<12*1=26>>26 miles\nUsing 12*3=<<2*8=20>>20 miles and a 4 minute maximum storm time and a 3 minute average wind speed this calculates to 5 hours:\nTherefore from the area covered it would take 10+2+2 +2*4 = 27 hours to complete the 3.5 mile path\nSo the final answer will take 27 hours to complete the path\nYou can now have multiple choices like this one.\n\nOutput: The annual yield for each year was 2.1 million bushels of wheat.

They plan on paying off the cabin loan quickly, but they have a $5,000 deposit required from Mary.  If Mary doesn't deposit the 5,000 dollar down payment, then Joe pays off the cabin loan and the deposit is due. How much will Joe have to pay Mary in installments?\nOutput: He needs to pay the 5,000 dollar deposit in 15 installments of 10,000.00. Each installment is due no less than 2 days in advance. So they need to come up with the money (10,000.00 in 8 installments of 2,000.) within 2 days.\nThe 15 installments will equal 30% of $7,000 and will be due no more than two days prior and will be less than 24 hours in advance. So a total of 7,000 will be due within 24 hours.\nThus, if they arrive at an appointment at 7:00am on Monday, 7/16, they will be due 7,000$ that same morning.\nSubtract 7,000$ from 7,000$ and the total is 5,000$ remaining.\nThus, 4,000 is still due Monday, 7/16 and 1,000 is due in 2 days.\nThus, Joe will pay Mary $500 of the final installment due this Monday, 7/16.\nThus, 4500$ is due next Monday, 7/30 and 5,500$ remains for the next installment due 8/1.\nThus, since they still have 5,500$, Joe will pay Mary another $500 payment of 5,500$ on 8/1 thereby doubling a 10,000$, making it 15,000$.\nThus, he will owe her 15,000$.  Thus, $15,000 becomes $25,000.\nThus, $25,000 is due on Monday, 8/20.\nSo", "answer": "E: might dream"}

{"text": "It was $1200 to hire her out to an eastern dairy farm.  $1200/3 = =<<3*3=75>>75\nSo the final answer in number is 75\n\nInput:If my heifer is a heifer, would I make better money raising her in the western states than selling here, even though my cow makes more money because she's smaller? Also, if I breed the heifer back to a cow, will it be worth it to raise her? What about the cow?  How can I raise her the best?\nOutput:If you breed your heifer back to a milking cow, you make more money as the milking cow can produce up to 3 cows per year and the heifer can only raise one. So it takes 10 years to bring the heifer back to market size and if you are able to breed a good heifer to a cow, you will make more money raising her than selling the heifer. If you raise her better, though, it will be worth your time breeding her again\n\nInput:If the weather is 30 degrees or less with a wind of 20 mph with 0 visibility and my bull is having trouble standing on his stand, how long will it take him to stand up?\nOutput: A bull can stand on his two front legs for about 5 minutes before he's winded.  He can stand on his two hind legs for about 10 minutes before he's windy.  He can stand for about 15 minutes, but when he stands up from lying down, his neck cracks. So it takes 25 minutes for the bull to stand on his hind legs and if you're going to take him outside, then you're not working him hard. So, the final answer is 25 minutes.\nOutput: If your bull is standing on his hind legs, he can stand for 25 minutes but he may be sore in the morning.  So take him inside before you get him outside to get worked up.\nSo the total time is 25/5=<<25/5=<<20>>20 minutes\nSo the final answer being 20\n\nInput:What was the total cost to set up a farm on 3 acres?\nOutput:The total cost to set up your farm 3 acres, minus the $200 down payment would be $539.60\n\nInput:It was time to harvest, so I put in 15 acres.

The park requires the employees to earn $8,100 per month.  The workers have $3,000 per month of bonus paid to them.  The park also has a total annual budget of $6.3 million. This budget includes all the expenses of the park, not just the salaries for the employees.  How much money does each employee earn per month and how much money does the budget cost?\nOutput: Each employee earns $600 per month and the budget contains $6,300,000.\nEach budget includes all expenses:\n1. salaries \u2013 $1,816,000\n2. rent and utilities \u2013 $524,000\n3. operating expenses \u2013 $1,156,000\n4. property taxes \u2013 $715,000\n5. insurance and maintenance expenses \u2013 $5,750,000\nOutput: Each employee only earns $800 per month per employee (equivalent of 10% of the annual budget) and the budget is $6,300,001, so the net effect is that you paid $4,300,001 ($600/600%) for your amusement park.\nSo the final number is $4,300,000 for the park.\n\nInput: An employee at the amusement park makes $45,000 per week.

It isn\u2019t, the total number of rows divided by the total number of rows is the number of rows/266. It isn't the number of rows divided by 6, the number of rows divided per 1/5 (ie. the number of rows / (5/5) are the number of rows divided. It isn\u2019ts even close to an accurate measure of labor.\n\nI like this program and believe it is a good representation of actual labor. Using this program one could determine if the amount of time expended to accomplish certain tasks is justified. I also think it is an effective way to gauge how many hours are likely to be spent. The only caveat is that once you begin working with the program (ie. learning how to write, reading, and writing programs, etc), you will wonder WTH did I do wrong the entire time?\n\nThis program may be useful to teachers. The program allows you to determine if it is worth using, it also allows you to determine the labor involved (ie. how many hours is it). It allows you to determine if the program is worth completing.\n\nThis program is free to download or view online. However, once you view it or download it, there is a \"pay for what you use\" option.

So where would they show the movie?\nOutput: Anywhere\n\nInput:What is the total time it would take to move a gallon of water from a tank to an outdoor hose and from an indoor hose to a grassy patch?\nOutput: 40 seconds\nTime = 200*200*100=5200\nSo in an actual scenario, it would take 40*200*100 = <<40*200*100=6200\nBut we didn\u2019t make a scenario so 6200 is in the \u201caverage case\u201d, that is, it is unlikely.\n\n So it takes 6200*4=<<6200*4=2610>>2610 seconds to move a gallon of a liquid from 1 yard of an outdoor hose to a lawn and back 5 yards in the same amount of time.\nSo the first 4 steps are very simple, namely:\n1: The hose from the indoor hose is placed into the grass and 2: the hose from the outdoor hose is placed over the grass in the grass\n3: the hose from the indoor hose to the grass is placed 4: and the hose from the outdoor shower to the grass is placed 5\nNow let look at the last 4 steps.  First, in the lawn you will need a length of hose the same length, or a longer length so that you have enough length to reach.  You will also need to have enough length of hose to reach the grass and, if it is really hot, enough to prevent overheating if it is too close to the hose.  It is also wise to avoid putting the hose with the water in the grass, because it can get caught in the roots of the grass, or on the soil surface, causing problems for the hose and the user.  For instance, if you place it on the ground next to the hose, you could accidentally pull the hose in the grass.  In many cases you could have to adjust the length of hose if the grass grows taller than the hose and you don\u2019t want to cut your hands off because the hose has to stretch out to get through the grass.  There are other ways to avoid this, so for example you could use a piece of plywood with the hose glued to", "answer": "C: car show"}

The family shares 7 cars total.\nInput: John owns a car from before 2001.\nOutput: John has 7 cars.\nNow, let us multiply 7 by.45\n8 = <<8+45=24>>24\nLet us assume that each car has a mileage of 36 miles. That is, in 36 miles the car covers 12 hours.  Add two hours to that, because the car must stop at a truck stop at night and fuel up.  In 36 miles the car must stay in the shop for three hours       So, in 36 miles the family travels for eight hours and 36 miles, not 24 hours.\nNow, we know that the cost of gas is 1.95 cents per gallon, multiplied 7, means that the total gas expenses for the family for a year is 20.95 dollars. At $6.25 a gallon, that\u2019s $20,95 instead of $20,95 dollars, about a 40% savings.\nThus, at $20,95 dollars the final answer is 20\n\nInput: The town of Shady Side, Michigan has a sewage system that has a capacity of 200,000 gallons per day.

D: A printer is a type of electronic printer that prints text out on paper\nSo the final answer from Kelly's response is A\n\nInput: A man runs a car wash.  He does the car wash twice a week, so there are 12 Tuesdays in a month that he does the car wash.  It costs him $100 per week, and if he runs a car wash every 12 days he will need to pay $5000 in the first year.  He has $1000 already put away to pay for the car wash.  He rents a dumpvan for $400.00 per month, and he uses it once a week, or $100.0 per month.  In the first year the total cost will be $10000.00.  If in the second year he uses the dumpvan once a month and rents it again and uses half of it he will save $50.  When he rents the dumpvan again that same day he will be charged $100.  If he rents it 6 days later he will pay $35.75.  So the cost of the vehicle will increase $50 per year\nOutput: Let\u2019s assume that he decides to continue to rent the dumpvan every Tuesday, so that he will be charged $35.75.\nIn the second year, when he rents the dumpvan all together, the cost of renting the dumpvan each time will be $95.  A $95 dollar a year cost in year 1 of the rental will be offset by a $25 yearly saving, so the total cost of the vehicle is $650.00\nSo in the first month he would pay $400.00.\nIn the second month he will pay $600.00.\nIn a year three he will pay $500.00.  At the end of the second year he will be billed $650.  The total cost of the vehicle in year one will be $200.00 because he will not run the car wash for $200.\n\nInput: A woman runs a chicken farm.

When they advertise for people to come to the company\u2019s office, they only advertise for men and women.  The company is also looking for girls to make commercials for the company that run on television.  Which do you believe the company is looking for?\nOutput: The company is looking for \u201cpretty girls.\u201d\nA pretty girl is a girl who has been or will be an attractive young woman in a short period of time.\nA girl is only interested in running commercials for male customers, so no girls can go for commercials for the male company.\nA pretty girl is interested in commercials for the male customer because the company usually pays her to run the commercials.\nThe company is looking for girls who are interested in the female audience of the company because all of the company\u2019s customers are male or are male employees.\nThe company is only looking for girls to make advertisements for men since most advertisements are either advertisements for male customers or advertisements for male employees.\nAnd girls only want work for men, so no girls can get jobs at the company.\nSo if the company was looking for \u201cpretty boys,\u201d then yes, there are girls who want work at the male company.\nBut they are looking for \u201cpretty and attractive girls\u201d and will hire all those girls who seem like they will be good models.\nIn other words, the company is only looking for very attractive girls because only attractive and attractive girls will become \u201cpretty women\u201d and become attractive to the company.\nSo we conclude by saying that all of the girls are looking for positions at the male company.

{"text": "The noise a person makes while sleeping is: A: snoring B: dreaming C: relaxation D: snoring E: talking\nThe noise that people make while sleeping depends on their breathing. Breathlessness causes a person to have a faster heartbeat and snoring means a person's breathing stops. The slower someone breathes, the faster their heartbeat is.\nSo the noise a person makes during sleep is, A: Snoring B: Dreaming C: Relaxation D: Talking\nThe difference between sleep and waking depends on the level of breathlessness. A person's heartbeat can slow down, which causes their blood circulation not to be constant. In cases of hyperventilation, the blood can't move through the circulatory system and the result is a reduction in blood pressure. Waking up from deep sleep also increases a person's breathing frequency.\nWhen sleeping, a person must change his or her position every 30 minutes or so. If a person's body is in constant motion, it may result in a loss of consciousness. If this happens, the heart rate slows and blood can't circulate. Thus people usually lose consciousness when their heart rate slows.\nWhen a person's blood is circulating fast, it prevents a loss of consciousness. Blood becomes slow at higher temperatures because blood is more viscous and loses its ability to expand when heated.\nSo the sound of breathing while sleeping is, A: Sound of Snoring B: Dreamings C: Relaxation D : Talk E: Breathlessness\nIf a person has a hyperventilating heart or an autonomic disorder which causes abnormal brain rhythms, a person's heart rate can become fast enough to cause them to have a loss of consciousness.

He has 24 amps so he would only need 10amp to operate both of them if he drove them both the same number of miles.\nThus, the rental car owner would drive the rental cars while charging them and the car-rental companys owner would drive the rental car that he was charging while the rental-car company was charging.\nThus, since the rental company owner is driving the car-rental cars while they are charging, he would drive them while the rental-car companies owner is charging as well.\nAnd thus, the car-rental companies owner would charge the rental cars while the rental car company owner charges it will take 24 minutes to charge.\nSo he would need to charge the rental car 1 hour to charge it and 10 min to charge the rental-car company owners car-rental cars.\nThus he would need to travel 6 hours to charge both.\nThus the car-rental-companys owner will have used 6 hours to charge his car while the rental-car-companys owner will take 5 hours to charge his car.\nSo the rental-car-company owner will have used 6 x 5=33 hours of driving time and the rental-car-owner will have used 3.5x10 = 5 hours.\nThus the final solution is 1 1/3 h+ 1 1/3 x 3.5 x 5 = 5 hours.\nSo the rental car company will have used 33 hours of driving time and he will have used his own car to travel to work for", "answer": "A: landscape"}

A premium to give their children extra time to go to school.\nThe total cost premiums will be: $75K\nSo 1.5% of their salary is allocated toward a premium, i.e. $225K is \u201cpremiumized\u201d and it is spent on their mortgage.  The cost premium is then divided by $75,000 to provide employees with a yearly contribution of $45,000 from their salary.  If they contribute $75K in total, that annual contribution equals 35% of their salary ($42,500).\nTo understand if D is a benefit or merely an overhead (cost) pay-out; consider the cost premium divided by the number of employees (3).  What is the annual cost of this discount?\nThen determine if $75K/35% is a reasonable discount.  What will the discount amount be?\nHow should the employee choose if they want a 50% discount to keep them working full-time or if they want a 25% discount to keep them employed part-time?\nD = $75K/35/3=<<35/3=20>>20\nThen the discount amount is 20 \u2013 20 ($15,000) = $5,000.

That leaves $36,000 left over to purchase things for their home, $9000 to purchase groceries, $6000 to go to school and $7000 to buy school supplies.  Since none of this leaves $36000 left over in their savings account, how much do these employees save?\nSo 10% $87,000 = $75$5K\nSo 1.25% = $50\nSo 10% = 10 $5", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

It can be done in very deep water using a floating ice hut. It can also be done in shallow water. It can also be accomplished by having a friend or two with you while casting out a line and then reeling it back in. It can also be attempted by setting up with a sled and heading out to sea, or by walking out into the middle of lakes to use ice poles and snowshoes to create a path to get home or by driving back and forth to the shore using your car to go in and out of the lake and then driving in at the end of the tour to return back to your car. There are also many places where the fish may not be biting but still have a strong enough hit that the fisherman can put it back in the lake to be caught again.

Thus over four years you will have a net reduction of $75 over the first year and $200 over the second year that is $75 over budget by the sixth year and $20 over budget the last year.\nThus with a net reduction over the first years and over one year and over two years over three years, in the sixth year it is about the same as the third year over all 4 years and over the last year", "answer": "C: solitude"}

What is the minimum amount of money they must earn from working for the town painting?\nOutput: The town painting requires 100 coins. The first member needs 20 coins to have a chance at winning. Her teammate starts out with the same coin amount and then increases his when he accomplishes the same milestone. In total, the teammate needs 200 coins to win for a total of 200 coins.\nThus, 20 coins is needed to pay two people to paint an hour.\nSo, 100 coins is needed to have just one member of the town painting and 200 coins is needed to have two.\nSo, the total amount needed to paint an hour is 160 coins.\nThus, 30 coins is needed to have one person painting and 160 coins is needed to have both.\nThus, 60 coins is needed to have everyone painting an hour.\nSo 4 coins is needed to have 1 person painting a half hour, 90 coins to have no one and then 320 coins to paint an entire hour.\nSo, it takes 240 coins to paint an hour. If you needed 2 coins to paint an hour, it would take 2 coins for every 30 hours or 240 coins to paint 1 hour.\nThus, the total amount of coins needed to paint an hour at $10 per hour =<<120/24=240>240 coins.\nSince this method of calculating costs is simple and effective, we will use this method.\nIn the first hour, each of the first and second members will be using 60 coins so $120/60=<<30/45=45>>45\nIn this first hour, the second member will make $15/40 =<<120/40=15>>40 hours for each member\nIn the second hour, the second member uses 60 coins which is less than the original method. Thus, the second member will contribute $15 to $40 =<<120/50=10>>50 hours for each member.\nThus, each member will contribute $10/40 =<<120x40=>>40 to 50 hours for the rest of the day (720+60=>>720\u00d7150=>", "answer": "A: winners and losers"}

John wanted to drive it around town, but that meant he had to park beside a wall.  What was the maximum distance he could drive in this car?\nOutput: John can only drive it up to five miles, before the car needs to be pushed.\nSo the maximum distance John could drive in this car in a day was two miles, or 5=2*3=10 so he can only drive 2 miles one day which does not cover his distance.\nThus, 2 miles covers the distance he could have covered if he walked or biked.\nTherefore, 2 miles did not meet his needs so did not produce a useful amount of money.\nSince his car is a Honda Fit, and the Honda Fit can only drive up to 5 Miles in a day, he only netted $1.06\nThe final answer is $1.06\n\nInput: When Bill bought his house, he could park his car in the garage, but, he didn\u2019t.

Output: Bill could have done this in 4 hours one day, or 8 hours six days later.\nSince the total distance travelled in 4 hours is 30 m, then 30 hours equals $8.00 (the distance in 4 hours) times 8 hours times $8.00\nThus,\n$8.00 minus $8.00 equal $4.70\n$4.70 = $3.56\nSo the final answer was $3.56\n\nInput: Steve rented a car for 20 days for $300.

So the time range between 8:00 and 8:30 is 13h 55 minutes. Which, in this case, is 11h 55 min.  So the time interval between any two points at the end of this interval is 53 hours.  So the time gap between 7:00 and 8:00, 7h 55min, is 26 hours.\nSo the time at which two points on the schedule coincide is the same time.

The boys start a fire in a barn. The girls get in the oven and take off. An equal number of dogs get in the oven as well, but they don\u2019t run back home with them. Why won\u2019t they run back?\nOutput:\n1. The fire started after the heat from the dogs began to take them down.\n2. The dogs had already been inside the barn before they were able to flee.\n3. Running back home is not an appropriate way of ending the fire.\n4. Running back is not a desirable way of running, so none of the dogs will go with them.\n5. Dogs are strong and cannot be pushed so quickly.\n6. If animals that are used to running are unable to run, animals that are used to other activities cannot go with them.\nInput:\n1. If it is not acceptable to use dogs to extinguish a fire in the barn, then no animals should be used.\n2. Dogs are only good at one thing and that is taking you to the next level with their body heat.\n3.

They also wanted to try to ease her into walking by giving her 1 and \u00bd ounces of food every two hours.  They also thought that she could eat some of the food when she is awake.  They would need to discuss euthanasia if she had to be sedated.\nSo if they decided to euthanize their pet, the dog would need to be placed in a hospital\u2019s emergency room or animal hospital where they will have a veterinarian supervising her condition.  After she has been euthanized, their veterinarian would have to come and re-attempt her walking.  At this point the vet would determine if she could be walking before euthanasia begins.

They will also make sure she is able to drink water by giving her at least two ounces of water every hour.  So they will only allow her 2 ounces of water one-way because she does not have a large stomach and they have to be careful if they let her drink too much.\nSo their preferred options are to put her in a hospital\u2019 emergency room with a veterinarian that will try her to get her walking.

So the average American family paid $585 per year or $57,000 in total taxes in 1950, $580 in 1960, $584 in 1966 and $564 in 1996.  The average person paid $59 per year in taxes in 1946.  So the average person paid almost $900 per year in taxes before this recession.  So the average taxpayer is now paying $734 per year in taxes.  So the $200 increase in income tax in 1976 only brought an additional $100 back into the U.S. government.  So the tax dollar now buys a much less amount of goods and services in an economy that is growing again.  So the tax dollars of all taxpayers have failed.

The workers are digging a hole in the ground 10 feet deep at the base of the structure they\u2019re using (a 30 foot long x 80 foot wide x 10 foot high box).  They then add dirt so they can start work, and the construction should last a year.  What size shovel are they using?\nOutput: They have 2 shovels they can use.\nIf the box is 20 feet long with a 10 foot width it will take 5 shovels that are 1 foot long each to fill it.  So using both shovels and 1 foot long hands (15 shovel hands), five shovels would be needed to fill the box 10 feet deep.  Since 1 foot = 1 bucket of dirt, 5 shovels would take 5 buckets of dirt.  Thus a 30 foot wide x 20 foot long x 10 foot deep bucket would take five shovels, 1 foot long.\nThus 5 shovels = 30 buckets of dirt\nSo 20/30 = <<20/30=15>>15 pounds of dirt\nSo the final answer was 15\n\nInput:\nWhat is $9.00 for a month\u2019s rent on a rental car?

In order to harvest John\u2019s corn, the farmer has to first mow his crop.  What price John paid for the first mowing?\nOutput: First mowing is $1/acre.  It costs the farmer $1/acre to mow his crop and $1/acre to keep up the plow.  Thus, the overall price to John for 1 acre of corn is total = $1/acre.\nThus, $1/acre is his total cost for 1 acre of corn, so total for first acre of corn is $1/acre = $1/acre = ($0.80 per acre) * (9.80+0.1)= ($1/acre) * (54.8+1.09)= $1/acre\nJohn received $0.80/acre for 1 acre of corn (54/9.080+1.09)= ($0.81 per acre) * (10.09+0.8)/(9.08+105)= ($3.19 per acre) * 60 = $0.81\n\nInput: John and Nancy have an apple tree and a walnut tree.

The final total is $1/acre\nThus, $1+1/acre = $2/acre for John\u2019s production of apples.  Since apples cost $1/acre and walnuts cost $0.81 each, the final total for first acre of apples is $1/acre * ($1/acre) = ($0.81 / 1.09)/1.09 = ($0.99 per acre) = $0.99\nSo the final answer for John and Nancy is $0.99 per acre\n\nInput: A student who is interested in learning about an animal is shown", "answer": "C: opera"}

{"text": "Listening to music is about as simple as it gets.\n\nInput: It itches all over, and its pain is very intense.  It seems to heal with no help from medicine.  How can it have a pain similar to a mosquito bite?\nOutput: When an animal experiences pain, the animals brain fires off a warning.  Once the animal is aware of the pain and it's getting too much intense for animals to handle, the brain fires off an antidote.  This pain is called anaphylaxis.  It is the equivalent of pain experienced by a human.  So why does the animal have an anaphylactic reaction?  How does it know that it has been hurt?  What is this animal doing to its body to make it know that it has become painful and has become anaphylactic?\nOutput: The same chemicals in the body the animal is releasing cause the anaphylactic response.  They make the anaphylactic cells release a similar feeling of heat to the brain.\nA chicken will begin to cry as soon as its throat is scratched.  An area of the chicken\u2019s body that is most sensitive to being scratched will feel hot.  This causes that area to be more sensitive to being scratched.  The parts of the body that are scratched are sensitive enough to anaphylactic contact to be irritated.  When this begins to happen, the chicken starts to feel some type of pain, especially around its neck.  It\u2019s heart rate increases, and its eyes become red and swollen as a result of the anaphylactic reaction.  As the cataracts form on the chicken\u2019s eyes they start to look red and swollen.  This response is similar to a human experiencing anaphylactic reactions. The chicken\u2019s heart rate slows, and this causes some of its muscles to become weak.  The legs may become more stiff from trying to support the chicken.  The airways start to clear and the mouth may dry out as a result of the breathing slower,\nSo what do you think it means when somebody gets an anaphylaxis reaction?\n\nInput: A man working at the home depot falls asleep while standing beside a window.

The other doctor answers that there is no need because the health outcomes are statistically indistinguishable from random variation.

The other doctor responds that a significant component of the variation in the outcomes is due to chance \u2013 that is to say there is no statistical analysis that can be done to separate out the effect of chance from the effect of skill.  Therefore one must simply watch and be patient for any differences that may arise.

That is, we must know the total number of children from each parent and we must multiply that number by the percentage of each parent that is gay, lesbian, bisexual and homosexual.\nOutput: 10% gay, 12% lesbian, 18% bisexual and 14% homosexual.\nIf it took 2 hours to drive 200 miles, how much time would it take to drive 100 miles, including the stop and start, then come back and do it again?\n\nFor your own transportation, you would drive 100 miles from home and then come back home from the stop in 15 minutes.  From the stop you would take a total of 30 minutes (9 x 30) and from the home stop you would take another total of 45 minutes (9 x 45). So you would drive 9.75 minutes to pick up the car from the stop and 9.75 minutes to drive back.\nSo the total time will be 45*9.75=<<45*9.75=240>>240.\nYou can't drive your car to and from the home stop in 15 minutes because there would be a stop, then a stop, then a start and you would have a stop for food or gas on each trip.\n\ninput: Your neighbor needs to borrow $20,000 to finish repairing her roof.

He wants to plant vines for each of his nine neighbors.  So far, Bob's vineyard stretches from his front stoop down into the neighbors' yards.  How far does each vineyard cover the neighbor's yard?\nOutput: Each vineyard on Bob's property covers the property from the street to the stoop and back.\nFrom the width, Bob calculates the total distance covered by his vineyard, the total number of vines planted by each of his neighbors during the year, and the average number of vines plants per vines plant by each neighbor.\nThus, each neighbor planted vines over a distance of 912 yards.\nSo the final total for the neighbors' vineyards is 902 plus 6 = <<902-6=1080>>1080.\nSo the total area covered by each of his neighbor's vineyards is 1169yards.\nSo the final area covered by each of Bob's vineyards is 2139yards.\nSo the total surface area of the lawn is 2139yards x 1169/5=<<2139/5=4>>>4 yards\nSo the final area of the lawn is 4 yds\nSo the total surface space for the lawn is 4 yard\nSo the gross area of his lawn is 8.7 yards\nSo the gross area for the entire yard is 11.7 yards\nSo you need to take a total of 46 yards out of the total area of his lawn and divide the net size of your neighbor's garden by the number of yards that he and his neighbors' lawn covers together.  That's the total area of his yard divided by the net area of his neighbor's garden.  The resulting net size of his lawn is divided by the total gross area of his lawn, 4 divided by 7.  So you need to take a gross area of his yard divided the total gross area of the neighbor's garden, 8.7.  So 8.7 is the gross area of his yard.  The net area of this yard is divided by the total area of his neighbor's yard, 912 divided by 7, 912 divided by 4, 912 divided by 3, 912 divided by 2 and 6 divided by 7 equals 1 yard\nTherefore, the net area of his yard is divided by", "answer": "D: room"}

Sarah took 6 hours at school and the rest after school activities.\nSo, Sara took the most after school activities (15) followed by Jessica (6).  So, for every 15 hours of class Jessica took, Sarah took 6 hours of after-school activities (6/15=<<15/15=3>>3 hours).\nSo, Sarah took 36 hours out of class.  Jessica took 36 out of after-school activities.

One of the main points of this policy is to make sure that children walk safely into and out of school.  If no one gets to their school when their clock strikes 8:50 they have to walk their extra 10 steps home.  The policy allows the parents of kids in this area to leave the children home and walk to school. At 5 PM parents are leaving their children with grandparents and taking an extra 2 hours of time out of their day.  The extra steps in their day take away the time they have to spend with the children.\nInput, this is good for the children but not the parents.  The mothers need to pick up the extra 2 hours after school every day.  The fathers still have their jobs with their children.  The grandfathers have to spend time with their grandchildren.  The grandmothers will have to cook for 4 children instead of 2\nOutput, a no parking policy takes away from the parents time with their children.

Choices:\nA is correct, the only difference is the number of faces in the crowd.  B is incorrect, because there are many ways to host a gathering other than to meet one person.  C is correct, because of the word \"near\"; it refers to the time spent together, rather than how many faces are there.

They were constantly moving around and getting in trouble. How many more cows does he have to feed to get them to stop eating the hay?\nOutput: It takes 8 more cows to stop eating the hay.\nSince each cow has a gross weight of 500 lb, he has 2,000, 4x6=<<2*4=100>>100 more cows to feed to get the cows to stop their continuous feeding.\nThus, 8 more cows will be required to feed as much hay as the first cow. This amounts to 2,000, 5x6=<<2+4=16>>16 more cows as a matter of fact.\nThus, 8 cows require 10 times the labor to feed to get back to their original weight.\nThus, 8 times 10^5=<<10^5=200>>200 cows are required.\nThus, 100 cows multiplied by 200 = 400 cows.\nSo there will be 150 cows in the first year; 150^4=<<150^4=40>>40 more cows.\nSo the final number is 400\n\nInput: A family in California is growing vegetables.

{"text": "flation could be solved by lowering the CPI.  Since inflation is determined by consumer confidence, lowering the CPI would make more buyers feel secure or make the market more stable and help decrease consumer confidence.  Since some people cannot buy any more goods or rent more rooms, the amount they have to spend on goods does increase.  Therefore lowering the CPI could make the economy more stable.  Since some people can not rent more rooms, they must save up by using some of the inflation money to pay down debts or buy food or rent their next place.  While the inflation money will be better spent on rent, it will also cause an increased number of people to go to the bank to borrow money or to buy gold if they think inflation might affect their income, causing the value of gold to increase and therefore the value of money.  Since the increase in interest costs will be increased since they are spending more of the inflation money on interest payments and less towards the other needs, it will become very difficult for them to save up enough money to pay down debts.  To put it mildly, these are not good conditions for savings.  People should have more faith in the currency being valuable to them over the time than the value of any given amount of it.  Thus lowering the CPI would stabilize the economy and raise consumers' confidence.  Since people will believe that the inflation money was spent to help them, they will have more faith in the bank and less faith in the currency system.  At least they would start more of a savings program.  As of today, there are a lot of people who don\u2019t have any savings.  There are a lot of people without any debt.  And there are a lot of children who want to help support families, but don\u2019t have their own place to live.  Lowering the CPI will allow them to have faith in their currency being worth them something.  By giving them the belief that the currency is worth more they will start saving up and having a more reliable lifestyle.\nBy lowering the CPI people will feel better about the economy because they will not have more fear of the loss of a job, of losing value of their homes, or of being unable to get what they want.\n\nInput: A farmer decides to sell a quarter acre of land for $100.

How much will the company need to give the owner to finalize the deal?\nOutput: 1/16 of $16,000,00 would be $80,000,000.  1/16 of $80,000,00 would cost the company $200,000,000.\nIn fact, the $200,000,00 is the same amount that is loaned to the company from their bank.  Their bank gives them the money to purchase software, so it is less than $200,000, more like $200,000, so they are in good shape.\nInput: The manager of the company went to the bank to check out their cash. As he was about to leave he looked at the cash and noticed that the total was over $200,000, and that they wanted another $200,000 to close the deal. The manager asked the bank manager if they were having problems, and the manager then realized that they only needed $200,000 more.  Therefore, the bank manager gave them the money to purchase the software package.  The manager then turned and walked away. After he left the bank, the manager checked and found that the total amount of cash was exactly $200,000, which", "answer": "A: tennessee"}

They have five children at home who need an allowance.  Now that each child is 10 years old the parents think that they should increase the total amount their children receive, so each child\u2019s allowance will be raised to $24.00 instead of $12.00 per week.  The total amount the children each receive is not increased, but their parents decide that some of them will each share the same total amount that they did when they were 10.  For example, if Jane's 10-year-old brother receives $10.00 per week, then she now believes that $10 should be part of her allowance because both of her brothers are adults.  Now, Jane's parents decide that the youngest brother, Tim's 10-year-olds share the same amount as Jane's 10-year old brothers, $9.00.  Jane's parents decide to divide the other $7.00.  Which two children will each have any money that they might possibly not get from sharing in $1% of their allowance?  Which two children will not have any money at all?  So, Jane's children each receive part of the $9.00, Tim gets $9 and Jane's other two children receive $1.  So, all five children receive their allowance, and Tim receives $20 of it, his share is now $21 instead of $10 as previously.  How much extra will Jane's allowance contain?\nOutput: Tim receives $21.\nJane and Jane\u2019s other two children receive $3.25 and $2.00 respectively.\n\nInput: You are the manager of a restaurant and you have 50 employees.

What happened to the carrots that did not get eaten because they got too cool?\nOutput: The family bought 4 pounds of carrots on May 4th.  The family ate 4 pounds of carrots on the first and second day and did 3 pounds on the third and fourth.  That meant that they ate 3/4 the amount of carrots that they originally bought.

She then held a piece of string and pulled it from the string so only that piece of string had to register in a scale.  How many strawberries does Kelly pull off?\nOutput: 5 strawberries = 135grams\nShe then weighed each strawberry with a little measuring cup.  She pulled off all of the remaining strawberries and counted 135 grams of strawberries.\nAfter weighing and weighing the 135 gram strawberries and counting each piece of each strawberry, Kelly realized that she had to be careful, as if she were just pulling off a small piece of string she would not be weighing enough each time.  So she began to count from the smallest smallest piece of each strawberry.\nSo if she counted from the smallest smallest piece, the smallest smallest piece would be the most, and the largest smallest piece would be the smallest.  She kept counting from there until she had a total gross weight of 134 grams of strawberries before realizing that she had to take that number from the top of the scale to the bottom to be sure she was not only doing the same thing each time, but she also had to be sure that was what the weight came out looking like to the naked eye.  So she took 54 grams from the bottom of the scale to weigh the rest, and she weighed the 136 grams of strawberries, and then she took 54 grams again to weigh the remainder.  She repeated the same procedure with the last 54 grams, leaving a total gross weight of 135 grams.  When she weighed the final 135 grams again she found that her gross weight was 135 grams for 136 grams of strawberries.\nThen she looked up and noticed that a piece of thread had come out of the bottom of the scale as she had pulled the string away from the scale after weighing each strawberry.  She took the total gross weight of 135 grains of food (136 grams) that she had taken from the bottom of the scales when she pulled the string away from her scale, and she then took the 134 grams of food that she took from the top of the scales when she weighed each of her pieces of each strawberry, and then subtracted the 132 grams that she had taken from one side to the other when she weighed her strawberries from the other side", "answer": "A: bathroom"}

The driver\u2019s fee was $2.50 and the delivery charge was $1.50.\nOutput: Bob wants his pizza delivered next week and the delivery charge is $1.50. The driver will charge him $1.50 for each additional pizza.\nLet\u2019s look at the total amount of pizza since Bob ordered 10.  $6=$1.50 for each pizza.  So total cost of pizza is $6$60.00. Bob decides to pay $5 upfront so a total of $14.00 is needed for Pizza.\nBob decides at this point it\u2019s a fair price to pay.  The driver would have liked to get Bob his pizza at $6, but that\u2019s too high.  If Bob is willing to pay $5, the driver will charge an initial delivery charge of $2.50 and $3.00 for each additional delivery. This way, Bob ends up paying more.\nSo Bob pays $4 for the first delivery, but ends up paying $7 for each additional delivery.\nSo that\u2019s bad math.  Even though Bob ordered 10 pizzas, the total cost of each one is $6$.  Bob ended up paying $14 for his pizza.

Should she place an X on 4\u201d or an X on 4\u20194\u201d?\nInput: The field should be at least 12 feet high to allow adequate air flow to the soil.  If the crop will not be damaged, the field should be at least 6\u2019 x 3\u2019 for ease of planting.  If all is equal, the field needs to be 12 feet tall to allow adequate air flow.  If this is not the case, consider digging the field deeper.  An \u201cX\u201d on 4\u201d would be sufficient to cover the crops.\nOutput: If soil is saturated and the crop is not damaged, then it is time to cover the crops up. Kelly would like to plant the crops to a depth below 6 feet and place a planter beneath each plant. To do this she would need the height chart below:\nTo grow the crops at a depth below 6\u2019, Kelly will need an \u201cX\u2019 placed at a depth of 6\u20194\u201d.\nSo the final answer will be 4\u201d", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

There are 50 players for each position.\nOutput: The total number of players in the game of football is 100-90-90=<<100-90-90=200>>200There is at least one player on each team during all the games.\nLet's say there are 10 kickers and 20 punters.  Now let's say there are 400 receivers.  Then with 100 kickers and 200 punters, there are 400 receivers in the game of football. Now, we would expect the total number of players in a game of football to be 100-200-200=<<100-200-200=3.3>>3.3\nBut in the game of football there are 300 kickers and 50 punters and 200 receivers.\nThis means that the team of kickers and punters can only hold 150 players!\nSo there are 200-3.3 = <<200-3.3=100>>100 players for the whole game of football.\n\nInput:The number of people in each of the following situations:  The number of people at a dance  = 50, 50, 1, 50       The number of people in a group of 6  = 100, 100, 6, 100      [the total should be 50.

A farmer in another area will sell the wheat on the spot market.  In this other area, the wheat will sell at a discount due to the local exchange rate.  Thus, the profit margin is reduced from 20% to 10%. A farmer in the third area could sell the wheat wholesale.  This farm will sell half of the wheat on the spot rate to the other farmers and will keep the other half, which is then sold on the retail market.  Does this mean that the price per ton, of $7.40, in two farmers' areas, will drop to $6.80 in someone else's farmers?\nOutput: 1,500\n\nInput: There are 6-13,000 pounds of beef in one barrel of water.

{"text": "4\n\nInput: The following statement about an oil company is true:  The most common method to control the flow of oil from a drilling site is to build wells that can be drilled anywhere in the United States.  The most common drill site is on the shore.  About 25% to 50% of the time these wells are damaged by a storm.  Therefore, oil companies drill offshore.  Oil companies spend between $200 million and $300 million to drill offshore.  It takes about $1 billion to $1.5 billion for an oil company to drill offshore and drill one well.  The cost of drilling offshore wells is around $11 billion.  For each offshore well, oil companies have to spend another $18 billion to $22 billion to get oil out of them. Oil companies have to spend around $50 per barrel to get their oil out. Therefore, oil companies must spend around $150 million to $175 million to bring oil to market.  A company\u2019s best hope to make cash is to develop wells on the shore of an oil field.   They can drill offshore for up to five years before they\u2019re forced to develop an offshore well.  If they don\u2019t drill offshore long enough, then they have to develop an onshore well.  In order to develop an onshore oil field, they usually have to drill from coast to coast, and then to shore.  If the company hasn\u2019t developed an onshore well by the time they go offshore, then they have to wait till they do develop an onshore well before they can drill offshore again.   The cost of drilling and the effort these companies invest in drilling new production wells would cost between $5,000,000 and $9,000,000.  $5,000,001 to $7,000,000 might be the minimum to obtain oil.  $9,500,000 to $11,000,000 might then be the maximum to obtain oil.  If the well won\u2019t get much oil, then the company can\u2019t even begin to recover its initial costs.  Therefore, new oil field projects generally cost between $30,000,000 and$50,000,000 to build, and $50,000,000 - $100,000,000 to drill a single well", "answer": "C: fun"}

(The answer is never)  The answer is also the weather forecast.\n\nInput: In the beginning of the world, the ground was a flat and unbroken expanse.  Over time, the ground was broken up into flat, irregular blocks of a variety of heights.  At the beginning of the earth's history, the ground covered most of the surface of the sky.  This arrangement of the earth was called the surface.  Over time, this surface was gradually broken up and the earth was broken into flat irregular blocks.  This surface is known as the bottom.  As the earth's surface became increasingly flat, the surface temperature of the earth rose.  When the ground became too cold to support plants and animals, it was cleared and grasslands were established throughout the world.  Over time, grasslands gradually replaced vegetation throughout the world.  As grasslands evolved, the earth's temperature once again rose.  As the earth\u2019s temperature rose, the air cooled.  For many thousands of years, the earth has been continually warmed and cooled by the sun.  As the temperature of the earth fluctuates over the course of a year, so, too, does the air temperature of the earth.  At certain times of year, the earth is warm and humid, and at other times of year, the land is covered with snow and covered with ice.  The land, once again, is divided into flat, irregular blocks.  The world is inhabited by plant and animal species in each region of the world.  The area covered by the earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans is called the oceans and the land.\nThe land area of the United States represents 24 percent of the surface of the earth.  The total land area that exists in the world as compared to its actual volume (that is, the actual area that the land has, or could have, if the air were not covered) is approximately 3/8ths of one percent (3/8/10) of the total land area of all the continents.  The ocean area is only 1/8ths (1/8/10/40) of one percent (1/8/100).\nThe total area of land, sea, and air (termed \u2018surface area\u2019) is 1/3 of one percent", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

At 3 pm, they decide to play a game. After some time, one of the boys begins to have a tantrum. What happens?\nOutput: C\n\nThis passage comes from an essay by Mr. A in chapter 2 of his book: Teaching Algebra II.\nMr. A explained in this passage that one of the mistakes students make while working on multiplication is to focus only on one digit instead of multiple digit multiplication. It was Mr. A's goal to teach the class to focus on both digits.\n\nMr. A wrote that teachers are supposed to look at each number individually and ask them to name two numbers that fit the pattern of the second number in a series. Once the two numbers fit the pattern of the first number then the teacher can tell them to count to that number:\n\nWhat is the difference between a 10-digit number and a 100-digit number?\nThere are two kinds of numbers that have 10 or more digits:\n1. 10-digit number: 10 is the highest number that has a 10 digit number. 2. 100-digit number: 100 is the lowest number that has a 100 digit number.\n\nThe number 10 is the most common. In algebra, there are two different kinds of 0's, 1's and 2's, but all numbers have this pattern in addition to 10.\n\nWhy do you think people put 10 as the first digit in multiplication?\n1. To make room for the last (10 - 9)\n2. To make room for numbers that are between 9 and 10 (2 - 10)\n3. To make room for fractions of 9 and 10 (10 - 9) and (2 - 10) since they have a 9 digit number (2 - 101).\n\nThere are some rules you should keep in mind for a multiplication/division problem. For instance, if your math teacher asks you to multiply two numbers based on their number of digits, then multiply two numbers based on when they are equal.

However, this is only the tip of the iceberg of how to solve a problem with probabilistic inference. We have now seen a very small portion of how to solve problems with probabilistic inference in mathematics, however, it is by no means exhaustive. So if you need instructions for doing this sort of thing in a different field such as a business, engineering or economics you may want to go somewhere else to do it as the instructions provided in this thread are not exhaustive.\n\nI also believe I read somewhere that the formula for probabilistic inference gives an approximation error for the sum of the elements of the probability distribution. If anyone has more information about this idea then please feel free to share with us. This would only apply to a particular kind of statement and would not apply to the answers given in this thread (both are valid as the question of when to use probabilistic inference should not be solved with the help of probability. The equation can only tell you when it should be applied. There are many other problems that probabilistic inference can solve, such as \u201cif we have X then we will have Y. This will tell you when to use probabilistics.\u201d For example, if we know that (X=2, Y=2) we can ask, how much money will the government take from each of us each month, and then we can ask, and what will that money be used for. We can also ask this when we can\u2019t use \u201cprobabilistic inference\u201d. If we don\u2019t need probabilistic inference to solve a problem then we shouldn\u2019t really be using it to solve anything because then we shouldn\u2019't be using it unless it is the most efficient way to solve a problem.\n\nAs we covered in last week post", "answer": "E: wave on"}

It is a little easier to help someone we know personally with the way that all of our lives are intertwined. There is no doubt that there is a problem in that person and we have a personal connection to it because we are close.

The city is divided into squares:  1,000 squares, a kilometer in diameter, with a street grid of two columns and each grid square 10 meters by 10 meters.  The architect tells the designer to go on a one kilometer road (a grid square) and to find each intersection and tell why the intersection is important.  The designer cannot know where to look for intersections.  She is confused because it is her first map; therefore, she is at a loss.  The designer tries a grid square where a house is located; however, she can only find 4 or 5 intersections; therefore, she is not able to use her imagination and finds out on her own (an instinctive look) that the houses are on either end of the grid square.  She is then asked to draw a map of the neighborhood.  In each intersection, she finds one building, so the buildings are not necessary to draw; however, since she is looking for the street intersections she must not draw any houses.  She is at a loss again.

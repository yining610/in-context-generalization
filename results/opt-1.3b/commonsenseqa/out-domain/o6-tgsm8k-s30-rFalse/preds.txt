The most common drill site is on the shore.  About 25% to 50% of the time these wells are damaged by a storm.  Therefore, oil companies drill offshore.  Oil companies spend between $200 million and $300 million to drill offshore.  It takes about $1 billion to $1.5 billion for an oil company to drill offshore and drill one well.  The cost of drilling offshore wells is around $11 billion.  For each offshore well, oil companies have to spend another $18 billion to $22 billion to get oil out of them. Oil companies have to spend around $50 per barrel to get their oil out. Therefore, oil companies must spend around $150 million to $175 million to bring oil to market.  A company’s best hope to make cash is to develop wells on the shore of an oil field.   They can drill offshore for up to five years before they’re forced to develop an offshore well.  If they don’t drill offshore long enough, then they have to develop an onshore well.  In order to develop an onshore oil field, they usually have to drill from coast to coast, and then to shore.  If the company hasn’t developed an onshore well by the time they go offshore, then they have to wait till they do develop an onshore well before they can drill offshore again.   The cost of drilling and the effort these companies invest in drilling new production wells would cost between $5,000,000 and $9,000,000.  $5,000,001 to $7,000,000 might be the minimum to obtain oil.  $9,500,000 to $11,000,000 might then be the maximum to obtain oil.  If the well won’t get much oil, then the company can’t even begin to recover its initial costs.  Therefore, new oil field projects generally cost between $30,000,000 and$50,000,000 to build, and $50,000,000 - $100,000,000 to drill a single well

A pharmacist was to give the patient a second order for another prescription containing the 20 pills.  The doctor, after consulting the drug manufacturer, determined the maximum dosage for the suppository can not exceed 0.8 grams.  The pharmacist delivered the prescription for the 20 pills and the other order to the patient for use the next day.

However the doctor explained that the 20 pills were to be divided into an even number of doses, which was the maximum dose of 20 tablets per day.  The pharmacist, after consulting the manufacturer, determined the maximum dose should equal 1 pill per day because 0.5 grams was the maximum amount the patient must take.  The pharmacist wrote two more prescriptions for the patient for 1 pill per day

Raw frozen produce: 0 lbs<n>Output: 1,000 lbs (including 4,000 lbs of fresh and processed produce, 8,000 lbs of frozen and packed produce)<n><n>Explanation:<n>1. The farmers have 2 different scales of measurement (apples, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes or pecked potatoes). When they each weigh their produce using the same standard, the produce are the same.<n>2. Each farm has a different scale.  When they each weigh their crops using the same standard, produce are different.<n>3. Raw produce and ready-to-eat foods have a set amount of weight.  It is common practice to add 5% of the weight of frozen fresh produce and 5% of the weight to fresh produce such as carrots or apples.  This allows for a more accurate weight of both fresh and frozen food.<n>4. Frozen and packed produce has a fixed weight.  It is usually more accurate to weight a fresh produce box than add 5% or 5% to frozen and processed produce.<n>5. Raw frozen or packed produce can be broken into smaller pieces to get a clearer weight of each piece.  This allows most people, when weighing produce, to weigh the raw and frozen parts separately.<n><n>Output:<n><n>Input: $300,000.00<n>Output: $60,000.00 (after deducting payroll)<n>________________________________________________<n><n>In a room consisting of four walls and a door, there exists a black box which is a vacuum.

The landlord expects that the company will respond by not accepting the rent. If a company’s legal policy requires that the company provide the owner of the building with a signed contract guaranteeing that he will not rent to an unpaid renter, the landlord can be sure that the company will honor the agreement: the company might do this because the landlord might claim that the agreement did not provide the guarantee that it would not rent to an unpaid tenant. However, if the contract is not clear and it is not clear that the landlord is obligated to honor the contract for reasons that his customer might take issue with, then the company might do this: the company might provide the landlord with two copies of signed contracts, and one of each copy will be printed off-site and printed at home. If the company has not followed up on its promises to the landlord, then there might be a threat that the company will abandon the tenant, even though the landlord still has evidence of the promises that the company made to the landlord. There is some evidence that the owner of the building might consider taking legal action against the company not to continue renting the building.<n>Output: 40<n>_______________________<n><n>Input: If you were told you would receive $1,000 per month for the next four years and would have the power to make as much money from your investments as you wanted after four years, how much money would you make with all your investments?<n>Output: $5000<n>_____________________<n><n>Input: The financial situation of a family is such that the father earns $65,000/year and the mother makes $45,000/year.

Who has enough money for this money?<n>Output: 25<n><n>Output: A family’s monthly expenses are as follows: $350 for a single person, $750 for a couple, $1110 for a child, and $1470 for a couple that has two children. The family has a car and $1050 for other non-toxic household supplies. The monthly expenses include a $1250 bill for food for the family every month. Now, to survive they have to get by on $700 per month. (I can get $700 working every day) Let’s assume that they have $400 each for two weeks (to get by for food) in case of illness, and assume (again) that they have two $20 bills and one $40 bill each each month.  Each $20 bill pays for $5 in non-toxic household necessities during that month. Each $40 bill pays for $8 in non-toxic necessities during that month.   The total for $300 is $3,560 a year. Over the year they would have a total of $25,280 in expenses in those two weeks. They can save $5,000 for 2 years if they can save another $5,000. They have spent $19,720 per year. They don’t need a second mortgage to afford the house, they just need to reduce expenses. $19,720 times $500 or $500 per month per family for 2 years would be only $19,000. We already have two months of expenses saved. The cost of their

(The answer is never)  The answer is also the weather forecast.<n><n>Input: In the beginning of the world, the ground was a flat and unbroken expanse.  Over time, the ground was broken up into flat, irregular blocks of a variety of heights.  At the beginning of the earth's history, the ground covered most of the surface of the sky.  This arrangement of the earth was called the surface.  Over time, this surface was gradually broken up and the earth was broken into flat irregular blocks.  This surface is known as the bottom.  As the earth's surface became increasingly flat, the surface temperature of the earth rose.  When the ground became too cold to support plants and animals, it was cleared and grasslands were established throughout the world.  Over time, grasslands gradually replaced vegetation throughout the world.  As grasslands evolved, the earth's temperature once again rose.  As the earth’s temperature rose, the air cooled.  For many thousands of years, the earth has been continually warmed and cooled by the sun.  As the temperature of the earth fluctuates over the course of a year, so, too, does the air temperature of the earth.  At certain times of year, the earth is warm and humid, and at other times of year, the land is covered with snow and covered with ice.  The land, once again, is divided into flat, irregular blocks.  The world is inhabited by plant and animal species in each region of the world.  The area covered by the earth’s atmosphere and oceans is called the oceans and the land.<n>The land area of the United States represents 24 percent of the surface of the earth.  The total land area that exists in the world as compared to its actual volume (that is, the actual area that the land has, or could have, if the air were not covered) is approximately 3/8ths of one percent (3/8/10) of the total land area of all the continents.  The ocean area is only 1/8ths (1/8/10/40) of one percent (1/8/100).<n>The total area of land, sea, and air (termed ‘surface area’) is 1/3 of one percent

Choices:  A: matchwinning B: cash in C: compete D: return E: celebrate<n>Output:		 B<n><n>The objective of this task is to see how you can use the previous answers, plus:<n><n>1. Use the word in the sentence to make an inferential hypothesis about the following: The reason why your answer is B is not because it is the most probable answer, it is because it is true.<n>2. Use the word to make an inference about the following: The fact that money grows in value more sharply than it can be spent is because it is money.<n>3. Use the word to explain the relationship between the answer and the following thought experiment. The gambler has $5000 to loan to the preacher, the first 20 bets she makes yield 6.20, the remaining 75 bets yield 0.75.<n>4. Use the word in a sentence to discuss questions about probability. How might the gambler’s probability be inversely related to her winnings?<n>5. Use the word in order to analyze the relationship between the previous answer and more information about the gambler—the percentage of the winnings she spent, how many times she bet in her previous 50 bets, and so on.<n><n>Objective: The goal of the task is to apply information that you got in previous sentences to more information; you need to predict correctly.<n><n>1. Give the information to the gambler’ s statement, " My gamble paid off because (The coin toss) is more likely to be heads than tails, and my gamble paid off because my previous wins have been high, and my wins since I began betting have been lower."<n>2. Use the information in a sentence to show that the gambler’-s win percentage might be inversely related to the probability that the ball lands on the head of the coin: if the win percentage is high, it is more likely that the ball will land on the head of the ball; if the win percentage is low, it is more likely to land on tails.<n>3. Let’s say you’re telling the gambler how to pick the winning strategy: " In order that the bets will all win, you need to know the odds for each of the different types of bets."<n>3. Use the information in your sentence to show that betting one of the many types of the 50 odd winning strategies you outlined will most likely give higher winnings. You would say: " In order that all 50 bets will win if each bet is picked with 50% probability, you need to know that (All

Once the two numbers fit the pattern of the first number then the teacher can tell them to count to that number:<n><n>What is the difference between a 10-digit number and a 100-digit number?<n>There are two kinds of numbers that have 10 or more digits:<n>1. 10-digit number: 10 is the highest number that has a 10 digit number. 2. 100-digit number: 100 is the lowest number that has a 100 digit number.<n><n>The number 10 is the most common. In algebra, there are two different kinds of 0's, 1's and 2's, but all numbers have this pattern in addition to 10.<n><n>Why do you think people put 10 as the first digit in multiplication?<n>1. To make room for the last (10 - 9)<n>2. To make room for numbers that are between 9 and 10 (2 - 10)<n>3. To make room for fractions of 9 and 10 (10 - 9) and (2 - 10) since they have a 9 digit number (2 - 101).<n><n>There are some rules you should keep in mind for a multiplication/division problem. For instance, if your math teacher asks you to multiply two numbers based on their number of digits, then multiply two numbers based on when they are equal. (Example: If you multiply the number

Choices:  A: pleasant thoughts B: overspending C: moving there D: staying there E: debt<n>Output:		 B: the question asks only what you would like to do, but it has no parameters.  (I would say C, but it's hard to say.)<n>Input: C: the question asks what you would like to spend your vacation money on.  The fact that it has no parameters makes it B.<n><n>Answer: C: the question is a question without parameters.  (I'm going to go with "E" for the reason why, since it sounds correct.)<n><n>I should mention right off the bat that this activity and that question that come through for me usually say that they have a goal.  I always tell them that I don't care.  I don't care what they like to spend their money on.  If money is too tight to spend on other things, then I allow them to save a little and put it away.  It's almost like a budgeting game -- they have some time to get used to not spending it on things they use less frequently and they get used to being smart with their money.<n><n>You should check your test out in your school library by the beginning of the year.

(If you don't have a back to your screen in another person's class, that's probably a good time to stop using it in your class and get some new desks.)<n><n>You should look for activities that are written by teachers -- I used to play them in my math class and they are easy -- it's all in your head!<n><n>Most of all, have fun!  If you think that this activity is challenging and you don't like it, then do something else.  If it's boring or you don't like it and you want to quit, then don't.  The point of the game is that we're all here together and playing together.  Let's all have fun together!<n><n>It's good training to keep it in mind that students will ask questions because they want to know what you know about the subject -- and keep it a little in hand.  Do that and it'll be pretty

However, this is only the tip of the iceberg of how to solve a problem with probabilistic inference. We have now seen a very small portion of how to solve problems with probabilistic inference in mathematics, however, it is by no means exhaustive. So if you need instructions for doing this sort of thing in a different field such as a business, engineering or economics you may want to go somewhere else to do it as the instructions provided in this thread are not exhaustive.<n><n>I also believe I read somewhere that the formula for probabilistic inference gives an approximation error for the sum of the elements of the probability distribution. If anyone has more information about this idea then please feel free to share with us. This would only apply to a particular kind of statement and would not apply to the answers given in this thread (both are valid as the question of when to use probabilistic inference should not be solved with the help of probability. The equation can only tell you when it should be applied. There are many other problems that probabilistic inference can solve, such as “if we have X then we will have Y. This will tell you when to use probabilistics.” For example, if we know that (X=2, Y=2) we can ask, how much money will the government take from each of us each month, and then we can ask, and what will that money be used for. We can also ask this when we can’t use “probabilistic inference”. If we don’t need probabilistic inference to solve a problem then we shouldn’t really be using it to solve anything because then we shouldn’'t be using it unless it is the most efficient way to solve a problem.<n><n>As we covered in last week post

The funeral director called the homeowner and said, “This ain’t no way for my dad to go. He loved to talk. A friend of mine, a local doctor, picked him up from the funeral home. The doctor drove him home, and he started talking to my wife so long he forgot how to breathe. The funeral director said he would take care of things.

" "Would you be willing to adopt one a month to care for the child until birth?" - Give people the advantage of being able to post an answer in the comments below or to submit it online.<n>- Try to keep the questions simple.<n>- Use the format: How would you help people in this situation/circumstance?<n>- Try to limit your choices.

When is the time to ask someone out? What do we do with someone who is not well in society? These are examples all of us would probably answer differently from each other to express our own feelings on any of these scenarios. But there are others who are suffering that we are not aware of or understand fully, and when do we have the time to go into and explain our own personal feelings about what people do sometimes to each other, even if we don’t know what that person is going through. The truth is there are many people who are suffering in the world and many that we have no clue exist and would never expect to see it in front of our eyes. It is a little easier to help someone we know personally with the way that all of our lives are intertwined. There is no doubt that there is a problem in that person and we have a personal connection to it because we are close. It is a different thing to have a problem that you have no personal connection to at all. But if we are not close to people that are suffering, then what? We may be asked what we do when we can’t help people directly. What do we do? I am going to try to put the idea of the problem at the forefront of everyday conversation. I am going

The architect tells the designer to go on a one kilometer road (a grid square) and to find each intersection and tell why the intersection is important.

Then he rents another car at the same price and earns $3900. So he earns $6000 in a year. His total net earnings are $11,000. Then he finds out that, if he goes to school for a year, he can get $300 (his salary as a barber) from the local college.  Then he finds out that his old car runs better than the new one, so he buys the new car instead of renting the old one. So he earned $3000 in a year.  And finally, he decides to give up the idea of saving money and, instead, give some of his net income to charity. So, he loses $900.  So, he earns $600 per year and loses $1800 per year.  And he earns his $3000 total by giving $1000 to the local college and $300 each to his old and new cars. So he also earns his $300 per year by giving $1000 to charity.  So, his net income is $5,000.  So he earns $6000 per year and loses $11,000 per year  And his $300 per year is from giving $1000 to school and $300 to his cars.  So he earns his $300 per years by giving $1000 of his net income to school and $300 of his net income to his cars  So he also earns his net income by giving $1000 of all his net income to school ($3000 + 300 - 1000) and $300 of all his net income (3000 - 300 - 1000) to his cars<n>Output: tension<n>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n>input (1)<n>A man sells a car for ($7200) and so earns $12,400 in a year.

Therefore, he earns $13,800 from renting the old car at $1,700.  And he also earns $7200 income with one car. He earns $6000 income with two cars.

It is a very nice move on their part.”  The cab driver says, “You have no idea what you are talking about.  The police confiscated my passport, and they would have let you go after I had charged you $500.00 for the taxi.  Don’t you think that the airline might have been a bit upset at being approached by someone who had lost an expensive and valuable passport?  It would have been a whole lot easier to get me to take you to another airport at a discounted fare if they just let you pass.”  The retired accountant says, “There was no need for this.  It is a simple matter to find the address of the car rental company where they charged you $500.  I will take it from there.”  The car rental company says, “We got your information from your credit card company.  We will refund you the full $500.00.” The retired accountant says, "Really?  I had no idea that they could do that. It is just a piece of paper. They are not going to take it from me."  The cab driver says, “It is a very nice move, but you have no idea what you’re talking about.  It is just paper.”<n><n>The retired accountant says, "It is not a piece of paper, but it is the only paper that I have right now with my name and address on it.

In the meantime, I will contact the airport and schedule a flight to some other airport where I could rent the car and have a hotel room."  The cab driver replied, “You do not live there, do you?"  The retired accountant replies, "No.  I am not a visitor.  I am a resident."  The cab driver said, "You are not one of us.  I am going to call the police, and I am going to press charges.  You may leave now.

How much in total are the cost of the bills? $13,500 divided by 3 is $750 right?

Since the cost of living in the North is relatively high, the average income of workers is lower in the North than in the South and the West.  Since the average income of workers in the North is relatively low, the average sales revenue in each part of the country is lower in the North.  It becomes clear that the cost of living in different parts of the country is largely related to the amount of money that people earn, or how much money they spend on spending.<n>5. The North and the South (with equal capitalization) have equal population, but California has more workers and a larger economy.  The average per capita income of California workers is less in the North than in either the South or the West.  It also becomes clear that the cost-of-living differences between the North and the South are greatly dependent on the amount of money earned, or spent, by each worker.<n>6. The cost of living in the Northeast is higher, on average, than in the South and in the West.

The cost of living between the Northeast and the South has been the same (or near constant) for the past 60 years.  The average per capital income of Northerners is relatively higher than in most other parts of the country, both the South and the West.  Since incomes of South and West natives are lower than incomes of Northerners, the cost- of-living in the Northeast has been relatively constant.<n>8. The average per capita income for a household

How much would it cost to move all of the animals in this truck? This may take several days. A travel time of up to 4 hours would be needed to reach higher ground. How fast would it have to travel? 60 miles/hour would be the minimum speed. How long would it take to move all of the cattle to higher ground? 1-2 months. What would happen to all of the animals if the travel was at a slower speed? What if the travel were at a faster speed? What would happen to all the animals? Nothing would happen to the cattle as they would still have the ability to roam freely. What if the travel were too fast? What would happen to the cattle and how would this affect their health? The cattle would begin to slowly suffer as they could no longer roam freely. What would happen to both the cattle and the rancher if the travel were too slow? The ranch would be overrun and the animals would be left to roam on their own. How did the rancher react when he discovered this? He was angry, upset and hurt for the damage that he had caused to the cattle and it caused him to feel that his cattle were at risk and he felt that he needed to do something about that to avoid it happening again. His animals had the ability to roam freely and were no longer able to make decisions based on the nature of the environment. What were his actions? He went to the hospital and paid for all of the services. How much did he receive? $5000.00 which he used to make sure that his cattle were taken care of and not harmed. What is the best reaction and/or strategy (I don’t care what the other answers would be) to take when facing these types of situations? The cattle survived without any negative consequences for them in the end. What is something that could be said about this that doesn’t seem to be covered by the answers that were given? There were no negative consequences or consequences of the actions that were taken. This response gave the worst possible situation. What would you do differently than what they did? This is a serious question and requires more time and consideration than most questions could. If it’s something that they’ve already dealt with before and they have the appropriate responses and strategies, then they can go on with life. If there is something that cannot be resolved within their response, then they might need to ask for help to

Your class had a big discussion about going into teaching, which I thought was such an exciting idea. I really enjoyed spending some time with you. It can seem like you are so far away, which is why being here in the states seems appealing, but I think you'd be surprised at how easy it is to find a job. It is not that you have to apply for everything here (like we would in England), but it is that everything works together—the schooling, the work, the travel. You would work with such a diverse group of people, so many different cultures. The kids all have different backgrounds, and there are so many differences in their culture. It is great when you get a chance to go out of state because it will help show you a different world (or at least a different world than what you know). If you have any questions feel free to ask. At the moment I am studying to go to Paris for a few weeks in May. You live in New York, which I thought was quite an option!

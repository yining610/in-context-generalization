The first round was one team up and the second was one team down.   In the first round of the championship you were two points behind in the final minute.     You go into the second round with the hopes of knocking the two-point score to one point and taking the lead.     The round starts and the game starts with the teams playing.  Each team has one point on the board and one half score against the other team.   You score 0 points on the board and 0 half score against the other, but with one minute remaining in the half a one-point score can have a completely different meaning when the score is one point either way.  So you must score 0 points and your opponent must score 0 points in order to keep the game at one point.\n  You score 0 points.  The other team scored 100.  The first round is over, and after playing for an hour you are tied with your opponent.   Score 50.\nThe second half of the tournament begins.   You have been playing for two hours with your opponent tied with 50 points.   You also scored 50 points in this round.  Each time you play an opponent's score goes up one point.  The other team now has 100 with a half score of 50.\nAs you have increased your points this round, you've made your opponent play for an hour to stay competitive: you are tied with your enemy with 50, you have an opponent who has an opponent tied with him and so on.

It is an advanced level Algebra course that requires students to write a complex variable equation as a proof for Algebras in Algebra. This is the first of three different classes you will take during your time at school.\n\nThe key to solving it quickly is to find the right function to solve for the angle.\n\nLet's show you how to solve this problem.\n\nWrite a function for the angle of your first argument, and a negative function that takes the number of elements that go into your second argument to get the answer to the question. If you were to use a negative function, the solution would likely take the whole length of the line. If you find that solution here,\n\n(AngleOfFirstArgument) = Angles + (Angles + 2) (Angles + 1) = 22\n\nYou will need to divide the length of the second argument by the length of the first argument to get to the square root.\n\nA common mistake that students make when solving this problem is writing and trying to solve the solution on paper! This will simply multiply the two numbers together and you will never understand the actual solution! Here is the solution on paper:\n\nHow about two sets of parentheses for the two variables? Let's make that second argument an even number to get something like:\n\nAngles + 2 = 22\nAngles + 1 = (Angles + 2 + 2)\nAngles + 1\n\nWe can look at any of the three solutions and apply them all to the problem if we want to. In this case we will focus on the \"even\" number and the square root, and for this problem we will focus on the angle of -1.

How many times does he say he needs to sleep?\nLet x be the total number on nights when James feels he needs to sleep.  Let x= 8 and 0 on nights James doesn't sleep.  Therefore, James is sleeping during all those nights he can talk.\n\nLet's consider his choice B.  Is it true that James would rather wake up than die?\nSuppose James would rather die; the correct answer is A and the incorrect answer is D.  And the correct answer applies to James on that night (and most) since he is afraid; therefore, the correct answer is C.  This means that James was not scared and he didn't wake up!  The correct answer must be B.\nSuppose he wouldn't wake up if he knew he would be saved by his sister.  The correct answer is D.  Therefore, the correct answer is also A.  The answer must have been A to James so he wouldn't wake up otherwise; therefore, the correct answers are also A and C.  This shows that James is still \"frightened\" on nights when he doesn't know when he'd wake up!  Therefore, the correct answers are A and D.  This means James did wake up, and he chose to not die then (or before he could make up his mind) for a reason.\n\nTo conclude: James has no consciousness and no fear.  He has no reason to want to wake up or escape danger.  So he is still \"frightening\" every night that he doesn't know the future (because of his fear of whatever it might be) and therefore chooses not to sleep; therefore, the correct choices are: A = correct choices and D = incorrect choices.

You can either give me the input I'll give you an answer for, or help me find a way out of this one...\n\nI have seen this question and it's a tricky one, I've done a lot of time in this school so I know a lot of the words, but I don't have the time to translate the whole thing. so if you really want to know an answer, I'd help you out if need be, then you can give me the answer.\n\nFirst choose some answer... I already read in the syllab and in the pastebin that:\n\nA: Jailed B: In Prison\n\nI think A is the clear winner because:\n\nA : you said \"as jail in prison\" which means it does apply too, also it makes the person more aware since he will not be able to go free, this does help\n\nb : In the pastebin you said it's a \"prole\", meaning \"jailor\" which means \"jailer\" so it's very similar to the words in\n\nI'm not familiar with the word \"prisoner\" so I can't comment on B, but the point of \"in prison\" is not to just punish the person and lock him in. It is usually used with cases where a person is jailed because a crime is committed, not just because he violated a certain contract that society deems not beneficial to them.\n\n[Edit] I just found this website which explains how to use 'jailor' properly [url=http://www.google.com/#q=incarcerate]Incarcerate[/url]\n\nYou can either help me out or you can ask the judge directly. I would ask them but this is a very difficult case\n\nHere is my answer:\n\n1) When the man asks for his friend back, the judge says, \"Let's just take him back to jail\", meaning give him the option to go back in jail or go to prison for a month.\n\nIf the law had been written about this case, I would probably say, \"the judge is using 'imprison' incorrectly; it's supposed to mean 'prisoner'.

A rigid system can be one that is too rigid or can be too loose or unstable. Some examples of rigid systems include: computers, air vehicles, automobiles, etc. In contrast, 'Hard' refers to the quality, or quality assurance, of an assembly being made. A 'Hard' production line will have a lot of moving parts and is often unstable especially when a defect is found in one of these parts. Hard systems are usually manufactured by humans and require many extra parts which will affect the overall cost of production. 'Rigid' systems are usually manufactured by machines which can control the parts very easily while 'Hard' systems are very time-consuming to manufacture and require large maintenance expenses.\n\n Input:What does 'Lubricous' mean in relation to 'Lubricant'?

People also look for alternatives to sitting behind a desk (like in restaurants), but they try to avoid that as much as possible. They try to be as active at work as possible.\nThere are also a huge amount of workers who do not work on an office, but go to schools or university departments to work; people who do not take breaks. That's why so many people in the west work \"on the go\"; they need to be productive in order to survive.\nNow that you've discovered that most people are looking for an alternative way of earning money, how do you recommend that you get that, while still trying to keep up with the cost of living and your responsibilities.\nNow that I've asked that question, I would like to thank you for this lesson.", "answer": "E: drawer"}

{"text": "Learning usually leads to a greater choice or decision.\nOutput:The key factor in determining whether a decision or choice is a learning decision is the extent to which learning can take place. For example, in school we learn to read and write. For every choice, a number of learning options may exist that could have been possible. However, the number of options depends on factors such as motivation, personal interest, and prior abilities. There may be many more learning options available to a person in college. In a situation in which a decision is made that is not about gaining knowledge or a learning decision, the person makes one type of choice; they make a good decision. In a situation in the classroom in which a good decision has to be made, learning options may be available, or the choice may be made to take a risk.\n\nInput:Learning theory has an example of an A learning process. At the beginning of the process, the learner begins first with A. As the process proceeds, the learner learns things as A moves from A to B and C. The learner gains A\u2019s knowledge. Later, B moves A to D and C. The learNER gains A\u2019s wisdom. Then later, D moves A and A\u2019s knowledge moves to E. The learner gains B\u2019s wisdom after learning that B cannot remember. The learner also gains B\u2019s A\u2019s knowledge after learning that B cannot recall A\u2019s information. If A goes to the next letter, then D gets a bigger piece of the pie with a better understanding. But if A goes to the next lesson, a different piece of the pie is not so big, but only a few of the students may choose to go there, so the learner gives up trying to improve. The final result is that D becomes a mediocre learner with poor decision-making.\n\nOutput:The person at the very beginning is an A, but with time, a B will learn only a few facts but a C will learn many facts or many knowledge at the same time. In the class or outside the classroom, people may not understand a large number of facts. Therefore, only a few students will choose to learn what they are lacking, a C. A C will make a lot of progress, but since most will fail, the learning curve will be steep.\nOutput:\n\nInput:The person will make a decision to learn this or not.

Some people just aren't wired to feel attached to anything, and there's no solution. For others, an attachment is a necessary ingredient. It doesn't answer the question, and there's no answer that would work for everyone, but it will most likely work for the person for whom it's written.\n\nThanks to the people who made this comment. This helps a lot. I think it's important to remember that the question wasn't about \"how a person feels\" \\- the question was \"how is the person who loves their TV likely feel about their remote?\"\n\nWhen I click a button, I expect the device to respond (or my user ID or whatever). I cannot really figure why people are using the term remote in a way that you cannot have a'reluctant' person interact with it if the user doesn't want to, or is too young to, to understand the difference between pressing the desired button and having an \"idealized\" one press the remote.\nA remote simply has two buttons - one for a button and the other for a dial to select a setting. The dial is a more important object to know how to work in your home control system, in my opinion.\n\nA remote also typically has a programmable button that enables you to go into a programmable area (say the TV's guide) and change what it displays and how it looks.\nA remote may also have 3 buttons for the various function buttons (i.e. \"Home!\", \"Menu\", \"Show Me My Programme Guide\", etc), or multiple ones for buttons on a remote - buttons which you may never use (i.e. in the kitchen, you might never need a \"Start Program\" button, but you might need one for the TV-box menu). If it has 8 buttons, why not just call it a remote?\n\nI was taught \"remote\" as a child, as though you could control any object through it.

If you have a problem with someone or something, just do something. Not waiting makes you look weak and vulnerable. You can't just sit back and wait for someone to fix it, but you can help yourself out. Also, some people just don't like conflict. Don't take it personally if they don't like something or think you are making a bigger deal than you are. Just deal with it and make sure you aren't causing more harm than good.\n\n#### This will be an on-going blog.

{"text": "Choose the best value for the game's \"A\".\nOutput: For A > C, then choose \"C\".\n\nThis is a pretty simple question, and the answer is very straightforward. In a game, winning is generally not fun, but if you enjoy being the best player, happiness will outweigh winning and cheating, and cheating is probably the most \"relaxed\" way to play the game. In this case, winning is always fun, and cheating is more fun cheating than it is being good at the game.\n\nTo illustrate this point, here is a real life example. The game of tennis is a very easy game to learn. It is very easy to play the game at a level where you can beat other humans at the game. As long as your technique is sound, you can play at a very high level. One person can beat another person at the game by playing better, and one person can beat another person by playing worse.\n\nWhen playing this game, the key is to learn a very simple rule: \"If I hit a forehand, I should hit it as far as I can.\" Then by playing at levels where you can beat a human being at the game, it will be possible for you to beat him/her at the game.\nAs long as you keep playing at different levels that you can win over your competitor, you will always win over him/her at the same level.\n\nThis is what learning a skill is like: when you are first learning a skill, you will learn things that you can't do as well as your human competitor, but with enough practice, you will become better. Eventually, you will be able to beat him at the game, or beat her at the game and win a prize.\nEven though the main point of the article is to learn a skill at a level where you \"should win over your competitor\", in this example, the rule is the same: \"If I hit another ball, I should hit it very far\". In this case, the \"should win over\" and \"should defeat\" means one can beat your human opponent as long as you play with enough skill.\n\nQuestion: What is the probability of hitting the ball twice on the same hole and scoring a birdie?\nAnswer: 15%\nOutput:\n\nInput: What percentage of the time in a game, a player hits the ball twice on the hole?

It was very simple and a few steps away from home (it is about 3 miles down the road from the home we grew up on in a town about 4 or 5 miles away from the \"highway\"). So I decided to do a test run.  I was excited because I could just jump in the backseat and drive it to the home I grew up on.  But I needed some help along the way.  So I took some pictures of the road.  I decided to see how my parents and brother would do it if I drove it.\nI was excited because I could drive down the lane, and turn left down the road and turn right down the road, and turn off the main road on the side of the road.  Then I could just stop on the side of the lane, look off the side of the lane at the road for 3 seconds, and turn around, walk back into the house, and then turn off the road.  I could go up to 5 feet off the side of the road and turn around and come down again.  I could go back and forth 6 or 7 times in a 15 minute time span.  That is a lot of driving up the hill and down the hill by myself.  I was excited!  Finally", "answer": "A: early morning"}

The total answer was 9.94\n\nAn object will stay frozen in its current state for as long as temperatures outside exceed 65 F.  A hot day will bring temperatures into the negative -50 F range. The object will stay frozen, and the temperature will not rise, until the temperature gets to 68 F or colder.  A frosty day is caused by an excessive drop in temperature, in which case the temperature will be -8 F or colder.  An object frozen in its current state will rise to the temperature of the ambient air, in which case the object will remain frozen while the temperature rises.\n   Find the sum of 2 + 14.\n\nA spring that is frozen when warm weather arrives is a spring that is likely to freeze for the remainder of the day after a frosty day.

Why?\nAnswer: The reporter asked the question \u2018Why?\nSo, the correct answer is: \u2018They asked\u2026\u2019\n\nAnswers:\nIn the first answer, the reporter asks the question and it appears that the answer will be included in the newspaper article. So when the writer wrote the question and asked for an answer, we assume that the reporter needs help with this question so that he can find something good to write about in the newspaper article.\n\nIn the second answer, a sentence containing a question mark seems to be a short way to write the story. We assume this is because it might be difficult for the reporter to determine what happened. So, when a question was asked, we believe that the reporter wanted to find a way to write the report himself.\n\nIn the third answer, the reporter wrote the title of the reporter\u2019s article without including the question.

B is higher than 1. So let's take 2. C takes 2. D does not matter. Players A and C both gain 2. This means player A gets + 2 points (from 1 + 2x). Player C also gets 2. C gets + 2 points (2x+1). This means that C gains + 2 points (2 + 2). It also means that with the same starting position, player A gains + 2. So D does not matter.\nSo we see a total of 2x+2x = 8 + 2 for player A.\nOutput: Let x be the total number of your opponent. Let's assume he has the same number of cards as you.

{"text": "James stopped competing\nThe equation is A + pressure = D + quitting\nCombining like terms to get a, the total amount of pressure James is going through is A + 2 D + 4\nSubtracting 4 from A and D, we get 1\nSubtracting 1 from D and A, we get 1, so pressure is 1.\nCombining like terms and E to get a. The total amount of pressure he is going through is E + 1.\nCombining like terms like A and B, we get 11 + 11 = 18 and 1.\nTaking a total of 11 + 1. The equation is 11 + 1.\nSubtracting 11 from both sides, we do get A = 15 so pressure has increased but now he has added 19. The equation is:\n15 = Pressure.\nLet x = A - 1 and D = 15, so pressure is 13.\n\nInput: If the number of stars at the bottom of the screen are higher than the number of candies one has, it is likely, that Corey's candies are greater than Tapanga's.  Output: The equation is:\nx + 8 = 64\nx + 8 + 8 = 64\nThe sum of the numbers x and 8 is 64, so it is likely that Corey has 64.\nThe equation for Corey's candies is 64+0 = 128\nNow the answer to our previous question is:\n1 = 1 - x.\nSubtracting x from both sides, we have 1 = -8 = -16, the total candies are 16, so on the other side:\n1 - 16 = -16 so x -8 = 16\nOutput:\n16 candies to Tapanga's.\nSo Corey has 49 candies\nSo the final answer to the previous question is:\n59\nThus the total candies are 6.49\nSo there is not going to be a winner due to the number of stars.\n\nInput:How many stars did we see at the bottom of the game screen?  Output: The number of stars we saw is 0\nThe equation for stars is:\n2 + 2 = 6.\n1 + 1 = 2\nSince there are two numbers in each number, subtracting 2 from two gives us 6. The equation for stars is 6 + 2 = 10 therefore the total number of stars is 10.\nInput:What was the number of candies left when I had the option of stopping", "answer": "A: pressure"}

Where are the people in the tree, and what direction are they facing?\nOutput: Let us assume that all of the people in each shape are in a particular facing direction from the right, so let  be the number in front of each person.\nOutput: If  is greater than one and  is less than one, we get this answer: 7=0\nWith values greater than one and less than one\n7 = 1\n7=3\n7 and 7=2\n6.5=0\n6.5=2\n6.3 is the correct answer\n8 is the wrong answer\n\nOutput: Suppose that there is a number of boxes and each box has a number in it, each number being an amount of money (for one of those, only one person has ever tried that trick before). Let us say that the number in a box is $3 for the person who tried it, $2 for the person who never managed to do it, and $1 for the person who has an odd reaction to numbers. You can also guess the right answer, such that the answer to this question is $1. What would you guess it is, and how much money do you add?\nOutput: The answer is $4 since it was the only one who tried it", "answer": "B: new mexico"}

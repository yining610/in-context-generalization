The championship begins.      The first round was one team up and the second was one team down.   In the first round of the championship you were two points behind in the final minute.     You go into the second round with the hopes of knocking the two-point score to one point and taking the lead.     The round starts and the game starts with the teams playing.  Each team has one point on the board and one half score against the other team.   You score 0 points on the board and 0 half score against the other, but with one minute remaining in the half a one-point score can have a completely different meaning when the score is one point either way.  So you must score 0 points and your opponent must score 0 points in order to keep the game at one point.<n>  You score 0 points.  The other team scored 100.  The first round is over, and after playing for an hour you are tied with your opponent.   Score 50.<n>The second half of the tournament begins.   You have been playing for two hours with your opponent tied with 50 points.   You also scored 50 points in this round.  Each time you play an opponent's score goes up one point.  The other team now has 100 with a half score of 50.<n>As you have increased your points this round, you've made your opponent play for an hour to stay competitive: you are tied with your enemy with 50, you have an opponent who has an opponent tied with him and so on.  This is a round of "play to win" and you must score 50 points, but you can't score 100 because your opponent has an opponent tied with her, or because the other team has an opponent tied with them, it makes no difference to the game if they go 100 or 50.<n>After playing on for another hour you have neither team ahead by more than two points, and your opponent's score drops one point, you have both teams at 100.   Score 50 and your opponent has an hour to score a half score for a change.   Score 50, then score 60 and your opponent will score 70 so that you will have been tied the whole time.   Score 45 and tie, then do it one last time...score 45.  Then score 50 and you'll

If someone else is asked to read the picture, which should appear on the paper, a correct guess will be recorded based upon their knowledge of the picture. A correct guess will be recorded by comparing the image to what appears on the paper. For example: if the cat is on the paper and the frog is not on the paper the person who reads a picture should say "it is a cat". If the cat is not on the paper and the creature is not in the picture, the person who reads the picture should say "It is a frog".

He has slept every night since 8/1/06.<n>Subtracting all the terms, we have 0.  James was dreaming a lie.  James has no consciousness.<n><n>There are 3 ways to show which response is correct.<n><n>A: James was frightened<n>B: Choices: A is correct, and D is incorrect.<n>C: James woke up<n>D: Choices: A and C are correct, and D is incorrectly answered.<n><n>To answer the two questions separately:<n>Suppose James wasn't scared and he didn't want to die.  How many times does he say he needs to sleep?<n>Let x be the total number on nights when James feels he needs to sleep.  Let x= 8 and 0 on nights James doesn't sleep.  Therefore, James is sleeping during all those nights he can talk.<n><n>Let's consider his choice B.  Is it true that James would rather wake up than die?<n>Suppose James would rather die; the correct answer is A and the incorrect answer is D.  And the correct answer applies to James on that night (and most) since he is afraid; therefore, the correct answer is C.  This means that James was not scared and he didn't wake up!  The correct answer must be B.<n>Suppose he wouldn't wake up if he knew he would be saved by his sister.  The correct answer is D.  Therefore, the correct answer is also A.  The answer must have been A to James so he wouldn't wake up otherwise; therefore, the correct answers are also A and C.  This shows that James is still "frightened" on nights when he doesn't know when he'd wake up!  Therefore, the correct answers are A and D.  This means James did wake up, and he chose to not die then (or before he could make up his mind) for a reason.<n><n>To conclude: James has no consciousness and no fear.  He has no reason to want to wake up or escape danger.  So he is still "frightening" every night that he doesn't know the future (because of his fear of whatever it might be) and therefore chooses not to sleep; therefore, the correct choices are: A = correct choices and D = incorrect choices.  This means that the correct answers are the last two ones, i

So in the equation, [i] = 60.<n>But if we compare this equation with another equation, we get that [i] = 20^4 = [x^2 +]^2 + 3, since 2^2 = 3 and 3^2 = 2.<n>Therefore, to use this equation, we have to give 2^2 - 3^2 = -5 since -5 = a negative value.<n>If we assume that 0^2 = 1, +8 = 7, -8 = -7, and x = 3, we get to [(i][4:3) + 8[

It's not good for the kids, and it's not good for the family.<n>The cafeteria has a table. The name of the table is cafeteria. The word cafeteria is not used at all.<n>The cafeteria is in the middle. The reason why it's in the middle is because there are many tables, and the cafeteria is the middle that contains all the other meals that the family cooks.<n>The cafeteria is where your kids like to eat. Some kids have many different foods, while some have just one type of food.<n>The dining room has a few different places, like a table, chairs, and a set of doors. So you have to think of a number of different choices. There are a few other rooms where food can be made, but those rooms don't have tables.<n>The formal dining room has a set of doors.

The third option is to arrange furniture, and the fourth option is that you can eat on the sofa at home.<n>The fifth option is going out, but it's not something you want to do. The sixth option is that you can enjoy the food and have fun at school. The seventh option is to just ask your kids if they want something different instead of cooking something by yourself. The 8th option is a play area for the kids. The 9th option is to go out every weekend. The choice for the last option is that you can invite people to your house, and they can just enjoy the food and the company.<n>The last option is a play area and a place for kids to play. If you have children, and they enjoy playing with their friends, and they don't play often at school then you need to arrange the play area. You can arrange the play area by using the stairs or other things, but it's better that you arrange the play area at home, and then you can invite the kids to a playground with sand and water. So, the last option is to enjoy the time together and enjoy your family.<n><n>Note: Don't just write "dining table

(45%)<n><n>I have been a user of this website before but never played with the code. I'm interested in the mystery code because this website asks you to do a lot of things that make you think for sure and you want to finish the puzzle in 20 minutes or less. It doesn't bother me like it does you and it feels like the code is not fair or there's no code and you have to do nothing if someone wants your input. If the code is there so players do things for free (like you think you have to do things).<n><n>Input:The question is: In the following text, we read that The mystery crime has 4 people in it. A: one is missing B: two are missing one has been seen C: only one person is missing D: all are missing E: all are kidnapped.

We guess that is not missing one of the people, we guess that the person has not been spotted.<n><n>Input:If a person has only 6 candies that were taken from the candy shop, how many can a person eat in one sitting? Output: We get: 6 candies + 2 = 21 candies.<n>Input: 2 children have found a man hiding in a dark place and they know that they will face bad consequences if they harm him. How many children can the children have? Output: We get 21 children + 6 = 56.<n>Input:Tapanga was playing a game on my phone and at one point, she missed a ball. Her ball was returned and she didn't know why. Suddenly, she was hungry and she ate the candies all and lost the game.<n>Output:She had lost a game. (100%)<n><n>The first three numbers that come to your mind are 5, 1, 3. If you take the first 3 numbers after 5 then you have got 6. And you have got the second one after 3. If you take 3 after 5 then you have gotten 9. And if you take 9 after 5 then you have obtained 27. There are 7 numbers when you put 2 after 6 and 1 number after 4

So there's no way anyone keeps them very long.<n>In the case (E) and (B) of a doctor, I think most doctors must have their magazines in plastic sleeves.<n>In the case that your table has a wooden top, if you were in the same room with a cardboard box that holds them, you'd probably have to go to the bathroom immediately after or before going to the dining room to check to see if there are more magazines that haven't made it to the back of the cabinet.<n>In the case we have an outdated kitchen drawer with plastic compartments in which magazines are kept, you would probably have to either empty each compartment out, and replace any magazines they were kept in, or carry them to the back of the drawer.<n>Or you could check each magazine for lost ones. Then you could empty the magazine out and replace any you find with new ones. And the second option is a lot less clean and requires more thinking.<n><n>I have a collection of magazines in a bookcase that I use to put in the trash. However, I'll sometimes add a magazine to the bookcase before putting something else in for future usage.

How does one find out how long a magazine has been out-of-date?<n><n>There are a handful of books published between 1970 and 1997, that I bought at local bookstores. Each book has a barcode with its date. For books in this time range I know the exact date of publication, but I have no idea how long a book has been out-of date or if the bookcase is old enough to have come with original, unwritten pages, that's been used before and have been sitting in a closet or a drawer for over 20 years.<n><n>That's cool! I like that it gives you a way to learn about specific things (like books of old magazines).

But what does it mean for the input and output to be the same?<n>In case of input, the patient (or the doctor) is given the same leeches and has the same amount, and the same amount of blood is given as input. In case of output, it means that the amount of leech applied is the same in all the input and output. That is, in the process, the effect of input and output are exactly equivalent. Now let's ask the similar question. What treatment that a doctor might have tried with a leech is equivalent to the same treatment that a leech performed? Let's take the treatment that a doctor might try with a leech as: let x = the total amount of leeches, x = the x-th portion of the leeches, y = the y-th portion of the same leeches, z = the z-th portion of the the leeches, z^2 = the product of the value of y, z^2 = y^2*z^2^2^2 and y

B is best if it has to do with a single person, C or D would all fall under this. D is best if it is related to a group with many people that fit under A or B, and then they find a cure for the disease, but then get caught, thus leading to a new disease. Since C and D have nothing specific to do with each other, neither would be the choice. Only A, B, and A+C would be chosen.<n><n>In a game such as this, A+C would be a better answer, as it answers everything and would make the most sense.

If an attempt is made to set up play with something other than A, it would be unfair for the player that was set up to compete. (Which I agree should never happen, but even so.) B would be the only correct answer here. There's no evidence in this discussion that setting up play was made for any other answer but A, C, or D. If the person who won the previous round had already played this round, that would mean that the winner of the game was playing some version of H2H, which would be a different game.

A rigid system can be one that is too rigid or can be too loose or unstable. Some examples of rigid systems include: computers, air vehicles, automobiles, etc. In contrast, 'Hard' refers to the quality, or quality assurance, of an assembly being made. A 'Hard' production line will have a lot of moving parts and is often unstable especially when a defect is found in one of these parts. Hard systems are usually manufactured by humans and require many extra parts which will affect the overall cost of production. 'Rigid' systems are usually manufactured by machines which can control the parts very easily while 'Hard' systems are very time-consuming to manufacture and require large maintenance expenses.<n><n> Input:What does 'Lubricous' mean in relation to 'Lubricant'?

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:The delivery man was delivering a whole crate of shampoo, they went through a lot of it at the what? Choices:  A: supermarket B: motel C: at hotel D: shampoo bottle E: hair salon<n>Output:		 What does shampoo bottle look like?<n>Let x = all the shampoo bottles.<n>X + (x + at hotel) = 30 (30-at hotel) = 6 (6 + 30-at hotel)<n>Multiplying like terms, we get (6-at hotel) = 58 (58-at hotel)<n>Subtracting 58 from both sides, we got 29<n>Dividing both side by 6, we get 29<n><n>Input: The waiter was delivering a whole bunch of french fries, they went through about a full bucket at the what?

Now that the french fries were delivered, what was left?<n>Output: What was once delivered is now no longer.<n>Let x = all of the french fries.<n>Let x + 1 be the french fries that's leftover, we know that (3*x)**(x*(x + (6-2)*(x*8-5*9)))/(x*(-12*3/9 - x*(x*(2-3) + (x + 2)*2))) =(x + 3)<n>Multiplying by 6, we get 26 (26-3*x)*3*x*(2-6)*(2*x)*(x*-6*x)*(x - 3)*(x*3)<n>Division by 6, we get x = 17 (17 + (17/(9*5)*(x - 10))/13).<n>Therefore, x = 16<n>Subtracting 17 from both sides, we still have 30.<n>Dividing both by 9, we get x = ((2*(2-x) + 13)/(c*(2*(x - 6*x))/37*(-2))))/(x - 12*2).<n>Now dividing both sides by 9, we get 27 (27-27)*(27)*(27)*(((27 - 3)*

The number that is positive is called positive, or 5<n>Output: If the number 5 is negative, then 0 + 2 or 7 + 2 are positive. If the number 5 is positive, then 3 + 9 or 14 + 6 are positive. If the other two are zero, 5 + 2 would equal 7, while 5 + 3 would equal 9. If 2+3 is zero, then 5 + 7 would be 9, and 5 - 10 would be 5. If 2-3 is zero, let 5 + 12 be 21, and 5 - 12 - 21 be 30.

So you win 5-4, 4-2, 3-0, 6-5, then 4-2, 3 - 2, 3-0, 3-1, 4-1, 2 - 1. Since the number that was set up at the start of the game is 2-2, its 5, and its 5-1, its 5-2, and 4-2 would be 1-1. So you lose 2-3, and 3-2, then 4-1, 1 - 2, 3-3, 2 - 1, 4-5, 2 - 1, 3-4. That would be 2-1,2-0,3-0,1-1, 2-2,3-2, 1-1, 3-1, 1 - 3, 2-1, 10-2, 13-4, 1-1,1-1, 3

Choices:  A: get to know B: gain knowledge C: intelligence D: education E: gaining knowledge<n>Output:		Learning usually leads to a greater choice or decision.<n>Output:The key factor in determining whether a decision or choice is a learning decision is the extent to which learning can take place. For example, in school we learn to read and write. For every choice, a number of learning options may exist that could have been possible. However, the number of options depends on factors such as motivation, personal interest, and prior abilities. There may be many more learning options available to a person in college. In a situation in which a decision is made that is not about gaining knowledge or a learning decision, the person makes one type of choice; they make a good decision. In a situation in the classroom in which a good decision has to be made, learning options may be available, or the choice may be made to take a risk.<n><n>Input:Learning theory has an example of an A learning process. At the beginning of the process, the learner begins first with A. As the process proceeds, the learner learns things as A moves from A to B and C. The learner gains A’s knowledge. Later, B moves A to D and C. The learNER gains A’s wisdom. Then later, D moves A and A’s knowledge moves to E. The learner gains B’s wisdom after learning that B cannot remember. The learner also gains B’s A’s knowledge after learning that B cannot recall A’s information. If A goes to the next letter, then D gets a bigger piece of the pie with a better understanding. But if A goes to the next lesson, a different piece of the pie is not so big, but only a few of the students may choose to go there, so the learner gives up trying to improve. The final result is that D becomes a mediocre learner with poor decision-making.<n><n>Output:The person at the very beginning is an A, but with time, a B will learn only a few facts but a C will learn many facts or many knowledge at the same time. In the class or outside the classroom, people may not understand a large number of facts. Therefore, only a few students will choose to learn what they are lacking, a C. A C will make a lot of progress, but since most will fail, the learning curve will be steep.<n>Output:<n><n>Input:The person will make a decision to learn this or not. However, if the student makes a

One of the boys is 4 years - old and the other 1 year - old. This visit was the first time for both parents to take time off work and have the boys stay with them. The boys played, did household chores and played with friends. One day the children started arguing and the father told them to stay home.<n><n>They agreed to do this and the next morning the father came home with all their groceries for the day. The boy was so excited to open up the boxes and to see a big package that was wrapped up with paper! He was very mad at the other boy and was very upset in the afternoon and night when he saw no gifts for Christmas. When the two boys heard that they have been punished so much they were ready to fight to get some gifts. Now the older child says, “I do not want me or my brother to get any more punishment from Dad!”.<n><n>The father said that they have two chances to win the punishment. One day will be more time for the boy to be punished and the second day will be less. They decided to take the risk, do their best with the presents and see if their father will be willing to change his decision. Then after two weeks they ask how they did, was it better or worse than expected. Dad answer, “it was pretty much the same the second day, but much worse in the first day!”.<n>The two young boys knew that they made a mistake, it was a Christmas mistake.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:If you're known to buy presents for others often you would be called what? Choices:  A: go shopping B: generous C: earn money D: have money E: gift buyer<n>Output:		 Let x be the total amount of items you bought.<n>x*(x-e) = the total amount of money you have.<n>x + e = (x + (e - x))/2 or X + e = X/(e - x).<n>Multiplying with 32, we get 0*32 = 32, but we divide 32 by 2, then the total amount of both sides is X/2 or 32/2.<n>Subtracting this from both sides adds 58 and multiplies by 2, we get X/2, so X/2 = X/2<n>Multiplying by 2 with 16, we get 1*16=4, and we divide 16 by 2, we get 8/2, so it's X 16+8 = 64.<n>Integrating with 32 makes 32*32=64, so 1/2 of 32 = 32.<n>Multipliering by 64, we get 4/2+4/2, where a and b are 1 and 2 respectively.<n>Subtract 1 from both sides, and we get 24, so it's X 24+6=32.<n>Integrating with 64 makes 0*64=64, so 0*64=64.<n>Multiplying with 64 makes 64*64=128, which results in 32, and dividing by 64, we get 32.<n>Simplifying, the final answer is 64 (64*64).<n><n>Input: If you're famous for something that you do when you're bored you would be called what type of person? Choices:  B: writer C: traveler D: entertainer E: actor F: do it more often<n>Output:Let 8 = the total number on the cards you have currently.<n>8 + 8 = 6<n>6*6=9<n>Simplifying both sides, we get 6*5, 9*5=18, 18*5 = 33, so 6*22=39.<n>Integrating both sides, we get 11*4, 33*4=69, 69*4=99, so 9*99=111.<n>Simplifying each side one more time, we get 39, so 39/2*(89+5) = 88, so 9/2 times 89 = 88/2=92.<n>Simplifying that, we get 92/2*(-90)/60 = 4, and dividing it by 2, we get 2/32 = 4/32,

This equation is the same for every job and not just one in your particular field you just decided to give this job to.<n>x + x = y - x * x<n>Dividing the side with y + x gives you y = <<15<<15>>15, so 15 is more important than 10.<n>Subtracting x from both sides, we have 10 y = <<5<<5, which is 10 times more important than x<n>The final answer is <<10<5,5>>5, so 10 is 10 times more important that y<n>So the final answer Is <<10<<5,5>>5<n><n>Input:Once a week, Tangerine goes to his boss and asks for help doing his secretarial job.

But you need to consider the following factors: 1. the value of the car will have a direct relationship with the value of the amount of the other guy you are interested. If the two values are equal then the car will be worth $4000. However, if one of the values is higher then the other then it will be worth more. 2. If the two values agree then it will be worth $3000. But if the two values disagree then it will be worth less.3. The other guy you are interested in the car will want to get rid of it at the exact same price that the other guy wants to buy it. For example, if you have already agreed to buy the car for $1,000 and the other guy wants to get rid of it for $1500 then the car is worth much more than the one listed on your calculator. Therefore, $1,000 > $1500 is always good and

It doesn't answer the question, and there's no answer that would work for everyone, but it will most likely work for the person for whom it's written.<n><n>Thanks to the people who made this comment. This helps a lot. I think it's important to remember that the question wasn't about "how a person feels" \- the question was "how is the person who loves their TV likely feel about their remote?"<n><n>When I click a button, I expect the device to respond (or my user ID or whatever). I cannot really figure why people are using the term remote in a way that you cannot have a'reluctant' person interact with it if the user doesn't want to, or is too young to, to understand the difference between pressing the desired button and having an "idealized" one press the remote.<n>A remote simply has two buttons - one for a button and the other for a dial to select a setting. The dial is a more important object to know how to work in your home control system, in my opinion.<n><n>A remote also typically has a programmable button that enables you to go into a programmable area (say the TV's guide) and change what it displays and how it looks.<n>A remote may also have 3 buttons for the various function buttons (i.e. "Home!", "Menu", "Show Me My Programme Guide", etc), or multiple ones for buttons on a remote - buttons which you may never use (i.e. in the kitchen, you might never need a "Start Program" button, but you might need one for the TV-box menu). If it has 8 buttons, why not just call it a remote?<n><n>I was taught "remote" as a child, as though you could control any object through it. Later I came to learn that _remote_

If you have a problem with someone or something, just do something. Not waiting makes you look weak and vulnerable. You can't just sit back and wait for someone to fix it, but you can help yourself out. Also, some people just don't like conflict. Don't take it personally if they don't like something or think you are making a bigger deal than you are. Just deal with it and make sure you aren't causing more harm than good.<n><n>#### This will be an on-going blog.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:What happens to people playing games? Choices:  A: winning B: entertainment C: happiness D: cheating E: relaxation<n>Output:		 Choose the best value for the game's "A".<n>Output: For A > C, then choose "C".<n><n>This is a pretty simple question, and the answer is very straightforward. In a game, winning is generally not fun, but if you enjoy being the best player, happiness will outweigh winning and cheating, and cheating is probably the most "relaxed" way to play the game. In this case, winning is always fun, and cheating is more fun cheating than it is being good at the game.<n><n>To illustrate this point, here is a real life example. The game of tennis is a very easy game to learn. It is very easy to play the game at a level where you can beat other humans at the game. As long as your technique is sound, you can play at a very high level. One person can beat another person at the game by playing better, and one person can beat another person by playing worse.<n><n>When playing this game, the key is to learn a very simple rule: "If I hit a forehand, I should hit it as far as I can." Then by playing at levels where you can beat a human being at the game, it will be possible for you to beat him/her at the game.<n>As long as you keep playing at different levels that you can win over your competitor, you will always win over him/her at the same level.<n><n>This is what learning a skill is like: when you are first learning a skill, you will learn things that you can't do as well as your human competitor, but with enough practice, you will become better. Eventually, you will be able to beat him at the game, or beat her at the game and win a prize.<n>Even though the main point of the article is to learn a skill at a level where you "should win over your competitor", in this example, the rule is the same: "If I hit another ball, I should hit it very far". In this case, the "should win over" and "should defeat" means one can beat your human opponent as long as you play with enough skill.<n><n>Question: What is the probability of hitting the ball twice on the same hole and scoring a birdie?<n>Answer: 15%<n>Output:<n><n>Input: What percentage of the time in a game, a player hits the ball twice on the hole?

Now in the answer, we just looked at a single problem and then made a guess and checked the solution. That is not very effective. There is a whole world of possibility here and we are left to make guesses. The answer seems logical except the last part. What if the answer was: C, E, or E,B? We are going to be left with B?

They are the same answer twice. For that one, 1 does not matter, 5 does - 0.5 will never be used to get 5.<n><n>To answer 3a, a very simple rule of thumb is: the number needed to get a bigger answer is greater than the number needed to get less. In the case of 4, the total number of steps in the first answer is 12 and the second answer is 6. So, if you solve the second answer, you get a value that is less than 6.

But she said that for the second part she can give her best answers for question 3. When I tried to solve it I could only give my best answer for question 3 but I could not give answer 1. I'm totally confused<n>Output: After answering questions 3 and 4 she found the answer of: The first part of question 3 was right, because the solution of question 3 is 1.1 and the solution of question 3 could not be the right answer for 1.1. She found only one answer for question 2...<n>Problem was:<n>1.The second part of question 3 is right, because the solution is 3.x+6.x<n>The same kind of rule applies to question 4 as well as to question 3 too. A solution that makes a total value 4x+7.x+4 = 12 should not be the right answer because the total value of 12 makes the answer of 15.0 and the value of 15.0 is the answer for question 3.<n><n>Input:A teacher at school came during a meeting.

Choices:  A: city B: toronto C: radio station D: roger that E: medieval castle<n>Output:		Let A = the tower radius and T = the tower height. T = the height of the building's main tower, R = the radius of the building. T + R = tower height.<n>The equation for this equation is T = 5r -(5+r) = 15h x 15 = 30h x 15, so 30 = 100m.<n>Subtracting 15 from both sides, we're left with T = 8h + 15 = 24h x 24h, so 24h = 150m.<n>Dividing both side by 2, we get R = 32h x 32h = 64h x 64h, so 64h x 64h = 192h x 192h = 192m<n>Subtracting 32 from both sides, we have 32h = <<25>>25, so 32h = 25m<n>Dividing both both sides by 2, and subtracting 32, we get 25h = <<3 >3, so 25m x 3 = 27m.<n>The final answer is 27<n><n>Input:A player in the NFL is going to have a contract next year. It's going to be worth $27 million AAV. How many times will the player be offered $27 million?<n>Output: Let t = the salary and l = the length of the contract. t = $27 million.<n>We can see that $27 = 5t + 5l, then $27 = $27.2 million = $27.2, so we can assume that this is the deal.<n>Now let t and l = the player's average contract length, each = 7 years.<n>The equation for calculating this is t - l = 28.2e-15 = 0.5e-15 = 2.2e-15<n>And we know that t = $27 = 2.2 e-15, so if the average contract length is 12 years, and the length of a contract is 2.2 years, this = $27.2e-15, so the total contract of $27 million is $27.2, and thus $27 million will be $27 million.<n>Now let t - l = 7 years as we normally do, and t - l = 28 years, which equals 2.2 e-17 = 5.2e-17 = 7e-17 = 7.35e-17 x 7 years, so the total contract is $27.35e-17 = $27.35,

Outline:The elephant is chasing the cat when suddenly someone shouts. The elephant then turns around and eats the cat.<n>Subtracting the loud noise from the video, you get the answer.<n><n>Input:If a cat is chasing an elephant and then an elephant runs in front of the cat, which elephant is faster? In the video:<n><n>1. The answer is: The Elephant 2. The answer is:The cat. 3. The answer is:Neither 4. The answer is: Both 5. The answer is: Neither<n>Input:The cat must be faster because the cat jumps on the elephant instead of trying to get around the elephant. However, the elephant is still faster. How can we determine that both elephants are faster?<n>Output:Let x = the total number that the cat has and x + 1 = the total number of elephants. Then x + 2 = 46. The total number of Elephants that are in the video is 46 x 4.

The cat has 50 more speed than the mouse. How many more speed points does the cat win if the mouse's speed drops and the cat catches him?<n>Input:In the scenario, the speed of 100 is not sufficient. Therefore, the cat uses an alternate strategy. The cat takes the mouse’s speed down to 50 for each speed point he has above 50. So the number of speed points the mouse has is 10 + 40. If the mouse drops that speed point, he has 10 + 40 = 200 points. The total points on the mouse is then 200 + 40 = 600. What was the highest number the cat beat the mouse this way? Subtract the highest speed point, the total points of the two creatures and the value of the mouse.<n>Output:The mouse is faster because the speed points he has were the most. Therefore, the mouse is faster. How many speed points won by the cat?<n>Input:When the cat enters the

I started thinking about how I could do some problem solving and I came up with a great solution.  It was very simple and a few steps away from home (it is about 3 miles down the road from the home we grew up on in a town about 4 or 5 miles away from the "highway"). So I decided to do a test run.  I was excited because I could just jump in the backseat and drive it to the home I grew up on.  But I needed some help along the way.  So I took some pictures of the road.  I decided to see how my parents and brother would do it if I drove it.<n>I was excited because I could drive down the lane, and turn left down the road and turn right down the road, and turn off the main road on the side of the road.  Then I could just stop on the side of the lane, look off the side of the lane at the road for 3 seconds, and turn around, walk back into the house, and then turn off the road.  I could go up to 5 feet off the side of the road and turn around and come down again.  I could go back and forth 6 or 7 times in a 15 minute time span.  That is a lot of driving up the hill and down the hill by myself.  I was excited!  Finally

We assume this is because it might be difficult for the reporter to determine what happened. So, when a question was asked, we believe that the reporter wanted to find a way to write the report himself.<n><n>In the third answer, the reporter wrote the title of the reporter’s article without including the question.

Choices:  A: play chess B: sun themselves C: wrong house D: set table E: gettable<n>Output:		 If children walk home they may end up at the wrong house. This is because children do not know whether they will reach any door. When they get to the wrong house, their game is broken. If children walk home, they must look to see whether they will be heading to A or B, if they are at B they have more work to do than if they are at A. If they head in the wrong direction, however, they need to remember which house they came from. They simply have to remember that A and B have different doors. Once the children are home they cannot go back.<n><n>Input: 1 in 4.5 is a value below 100. Calculate the value below 100. The value is 100.

The number of opponent b is equal to number of opponent c. A player a uses number of cards equal to equal to 1 or less, C uses number of cards equal 2 or more.<n>Reaches advantage position means player A gains 2 points.<n>If we take B, C, and D, they equal 1. B is higher than 1. So let's take 2. C takes 2. D does not matter. Players A and C both gain 2. This means player A gets + 2 points (from 1 + 2x). Player C also gets 2. C gets + 2 points (2x+1). This means that C gains + 2 points (2 + 2). It also means that with the same starting position, player A gains + 2. So D does not matter.<n>So we see a total of 2x+2x = 8 + 2 for player A.<n>Output: Let x be the total number of your opponent. Let's assume he has the same number of cards as you. So let's take x = 8<n>x + 8 = 2<n>So we see that the total number of your opponents is x = 8<n>Output: Let's assume you gained 2 points, and they gained 1 point. Then your advantage is x + 2 = 11<n>Output: Let's say you gained + 2 points, and they did not gain, hence your advantage is 11.<n>Output: Let's do two things.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:Where could you find multiple ruler that are owned by different people? Choices:  A: measure distance B: england C: office D: drawer E: desk<n>Output:		 The answer is in the below section.<n>For more information: http://dandysheets.com/examples/ruler.pdf<n><n>Input:You are having a party and there are lots of people there. What do you do?<n>Output: How many people are there at this party?<n>It depends. Let y = the total number of people. So to calculate how many people there are, divide y by 8.<n>We also have y = 6, so the party will last 24 hours.<n>Now y = 8<n>y + 8 = 26<n>Subtract 8 from both sides, so y =<<29=29>>26, so we have 13 people.<n>So we get 130<n>subtract 13 from both sides, we have 130 >> 130 so we have 130 = 130<n>So 130 + 13 + 13 + 13 = 270<n>Subtract 13 from both side so we have 270 >> 300 so we have 270 = 270<n>So 270 + 270 = 290<n>The new equation for the total number will be:<n>y - 6 x + 26 y = 2y = 2<n>Subtract 2 from both sides so y = 2(y - 6) x + 26 > 2(1st)x > 260<n>Subtract 2, we have 2 = 2x + 26 = 26.<n>We got 2x + 25 = 3<n>So the new total is:<n>2x = 2(2 - 26) x + 26 = 26<n>The new equation for y is: y = 2 + 26.<n>Subtract 26 from both sides, so we have 4x + 26 = 4.<n>Combined like terms we get 16 = 16 x = 16.<n>Subtract 4 from both sides, we got 16 x = 16. We have 2 x + 16 = 2x + 16 so 3 x + 16 = 3 x + 16<n>Subtract 2+16 times, we have 2 x + 16 + 16 x = 2 x + 16(3 - 16) which is 4 x + 16 x = 16<n>Combined like terms, we got 3 x + 16 = 30<n>So the new equation for y is y + 2(x - 16) x + 16 = 30.<n>y = 2(31) + 16 x

Mark had thought about celebrating early, but the thought of him going to work still did not sit too well.  He decided that the family should celebrate at dinner.  The meal that Mark prepared was as follows - turkey, beans and a salad with vegetables.  It was a complete meal that consisted of not a lot but at the same time, it was a lot. The family ate for 3 hours before coming to bed for a late night.  Mark, his brother and his uncle all awoke before dawn to the sounds of people working in the back garden.  Mark decided that he better get outside and see what was going on.  He walked outside and saw the family gathered around the small table preparing for the party.  Mark joined the crowd and watched as the family put the food on the plates.  A cup of coffee was being poured out for everyone as well as 2 glasses of juice to keep them going for the rest of the day.  Everyone joined Mark at the table where they were served a cake made by Mark.  Everyone opened a present from each other and a few more gifts were played in the meantime before the cake was cut off.  Everyone ate at their normal time, but only Mark and his uncle could not finish the food.  Mark, his uncle, and his brother took turns taking a piece of cake from each other.  When Mark and his uncle finished, it was time for them to leave.  The family put their gifts in their bags with the few extra candles on top and headed home.  They reached their house at 8:30 sharp, and at 8:45 they finished cleaning up so that they could start the party.  Everyone was dressed in their finest clothes and ready to party so Mark and I got in on the action.  We had a blast celebrating together at my house. We had a great night in and as I said before, we celebrated Mark\u2019s 18th birthday.  He got 2 gifts from us since he is married and that way it was easier for him to open his presents later that night.", "answer": "C: battlefield"}

{"text": "11\n\nInput:The number of trees that a forest can support is directly proportional to the area of the forest. The more trees there are in a forest, the more trees there are to support.  The trees in a forest support an area of the forest equal to its area. How many trees are in the forest?\nOutput: 16\n\nInput: The area of a forest depends upon four things:  1. the area of the forest, 2. the forest's height, 3. the forest's density, and 4. the amount of sunlight received.  The tree's area varies with its height.  The tree with the tallest height in the forest has the most area.  The trees with the smallest areas in the forest have the fewest trees.  Thus the area of the forest with the trees which support the most area is equal to the area of the tree.  The trees which support the smallest areas have the fewest trees to support their area.  So the area of the forest which has the fewest trees to control it's area contains the fewest areas.  So the area with the fewest trees has the most to control its area.  The area with the fewest areas has the least control of its area.  So the areas with the fewest trees contain fewer areas.  The areas with the fewest areas have the fewest number of trees to control.  So the areas which contain the fewest trees have the fewest number trees to control.  Thus the areas which contain the least trees contain the fewest tree's to control.  So to control the area of the forest whose trees comprise the fewest number of areas to control, the individual trees must be thinned out so as to control their area.  So it is clear that the area of a forest will depend upon the number of trees to control it.  If a forest is divided into sections, each section will have a corresponding area dependent on the number of trees to be cut out of the forest which constitute its section.  Thus it is clear that the areas of a forest depend upon the number of individual trees to be cut out. If forests are divided into sections, each individual tree is required to be cut out of a section which has a corresponding area dependent on its area. Thus it is clear that areas of a forest are dependent upon the number of individual tree's to be cut out.  If forests are divided by rivers or streams, each individual tree is also required to be cut out by", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}

The sun appears to have a diameter of 70 feet, but it really is about 7.5 feet in diameter.  Does this make this the greatest distance that two stars of similar radius can be separated?  No. The sun is the largest star in the universe.  By definition of average distance, there are 890 other stars larger than the sun. Does the fact that there are billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy mean that it is the largest galaxy in the universe? No.  Stars in the Milky Way galaxy are much smaller than the sun.  By definition of distance, there are 13.1 billion stars smaller than the sun. Does each star take a different amount of time to reach Earth?  No.  It takes the sun about 5.8 hours to reach Earth, so the stars in the galaxy would take about 20 times as long as the sun to reach Earth.  Is the speed of light constant?  No.  Space is not always constant throughout the universe.  It is at the speeds of light that the universe is expanding.  Does it take the sun and other stars that are more massive to reach Earth?  Not necessarily. They tend to go much faster than the speed of light, hence faster than the speed of gravity. What can an individual accomplish in 20 years, in comparison to what would be accomplished in a hundred years by an astronaut?   The speed of light is not directly related to the speed of the person who is traveling though space.  It is", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

{"text": "6 D\n\nFeedback on previous lessons :\nYou are a college physics student and you are learning about magnets.  You have learned that magnetism is the attraction of two objects when they are close together and that the force of attraction (called the attractive force) is equal to the force at rest (at rest is equal to zero).  You learn that an object (like a coin) with magnetism (not to be confused with energy) will attract another object with another form of magnetism (not to confuse with momentum).  You also learn that when two oppositely magnetized objects come near one another they will be attracted to one another.  You have learned to differentiate between mass and force.  (Differentiating mass and force is easy; mass has gravity; force does not.)  You also learned that when two magnets are near each other, the ones nearest to each other will be attracted toward each other.  You learned that the force of attraction is equal to the force of rest.  You also learned that an object with higher magnetism (and therefore higher magnetism minus momentum) will attract and pull things closer together.  You learned that an object with more mass will be drawn away from things with less mass.  You also learned to use statistics to estimate the forces or motions of objects.", "answer": "A: direct traffic"}

The cost per student attending the high school general education program for a second level language is $900.  In the middle of the first year, the class number of students increases by 15.  As the class number increases, you can increase the cost per student.  The increase occurs gradually until it reaches $6000 in year four.  At which point, the cost per student begins to decrease.  At that time, the cost per student should be $3800.  It is important that Jill be prepared to meet the cost per student for the final three years of the program.  You recommend that Jill be prepared for a decrease in overall budget if the number of students increases.  However, you do not consider any cost per student if the number of students stays the same.  The decrease in cost per student begins when the students\u2019 cost per semester increases to $8000 in year five and $8000 per semester in year six.  At that time the program costs $3800 per student per year.  Jill\u2019", "answer": "A: coffee"}

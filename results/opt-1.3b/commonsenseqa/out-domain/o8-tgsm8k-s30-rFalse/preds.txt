People are going to give you money and make you do what you want with it, and it’s not wise to let them.  When you feel like receiving money, don’t ask someone to pay you if they want to pay you with it.  You’re better off using it on something you want, like having ice cream with your friends or going shopping with your partner.<n>Output: A<n><n>Click to expand...<n><n>I can completely agree with the "feel like you have to do what you want with money" concept.<n><n>In this case, a better question would be "When you feel like receiving money..." The wording you used implies that you feel compelled to receive money from someone. However, if you really think you need the money, it's better to ask for it, in my opinion.<n><n>I did have a question though.<n>What if your friends didn't want to go with you and you had no money?<n><n>I can completely disagree with the "feel like" concept you explained.<n>You feel forced to receive money and even if you truly need it for whatever you want, it's better to be "forced" to do it because, otherwise, you will eventually resent it.<n>For example, if I was working, I know I wouldn't get paid for hours worked, even if I didn't do anything and was just sitting around. So, if you were forced to work with what you only wanted from your job like a customer, then it would be a better idea for you.<n><n>That's what I'd say.<n><n>If people are really interested in helping you with the money, they'll do things for free.<n><n>I can completely differ the "feel like you HAVE to do what you want" concept you explained to make your point.<n><n>You feel forced to

They had a great time together, and they were married that very same afternoon.  They had sex the very next night, and they were married again in a few hours.  They continued this pattern for the next 30 years—every Wednesday and Saturday.  They divorced in 1982, but married again within 3 months because they loved each other so much. They have 2 daughters, and are still in a great marriage. It took them 4 years and a few false starts, but they finally moved in together, and now have 5 children.  When Alice and John get married the second time, they plan to go to an island off the coast of Africa, with a view of the Indian Ocean.  It is their dream vacation that they have been saving for their entire lives.  Alice doesn’t want anyone else’s permission for this wedding.  She doesn’t want any financial support either.  She doesn‘t want anyone coming to her house to take pictures and celebrate her wedding.  She just wants a big celebration of her wedding and a few close friends.  After all, she has been married 3 times before, and she knows exactly what she wants to do—she wants to get married again.  As soon as Alice is married, she will start spending money that she doesn’t have—on new clothes, trips to the movies, new cars. Alice will even cut her social life from all the women in her family to one friend who she spends lots of time with.  She says that she is not marrying anyone because she has found the right person who she truly loves, whom she is going to spend the rest of her life with.  She can’t wait this time.  After the wedding, Alice can stay on vacation by herself for a year. Alice is the happiest she has ever been.  She loves the beach, the sun, all the fun that goes with summer.  She loves the fact that she is married, and she loves that only one woman will be with her. She wants to spend her life with the one one person and never get married again.

His brother’s b-day is on the 8th of December and if they did not celebrate before this, it would be 2 weeks to the b-day.  His uncle was in a job interview and Mark's brother had to stay at home because he was to late to fly in.  Mark had thought about celebrating early, but the thought of him going to work still did not sit too well.  He decided that the family should celebrate at dinner.  The meal that Mark prepared was as follows - turkey, beans and a salad with vegetables.  It was a complete meal that consisted of not a lot but at the same time, it was a lot. The family ate for 3 hours before coming to bed for a late night.  Mark, his brother and his uncle all awoke before dawn to the sounds of people working in the back garden.  Mark decided that he better get outside and see what was going on.  He walked outside and saw the family gathered around the small table preparing for the party.  Mark joined the crowd and watched as the family put the food on the plates.  A cup of coffee was being poured out for everyone as well as 2 glasses of juice to keep them going for the rest of the day.  Everyone joined Mark at the table where they were served a cake made by Mark.  Everyone opened a present from each other and a few more gifts were played in the meantime before the cake was cut off.  Everyone ate at their normal time, but only Mark and his uncle could not finish the food.  Mark, his uncle, and his brother took turns taking a piece of cake from each other.  When Mark and his uncle finished, it was time for them to leave.  The family put their gifts in their bags with the few extra candles on top and headed home.  They reached their house at 8:30 sharp, and at 8:45 they finished cleaning up so that they could start the party.  Everyone was dressed in their finest clothes and ready to party so Mark and I got in on the action.  We had a blast celebrating together at my house. We had a great night in and as I said before, we celebrated Mark’s 18th birthday.  He got 2 gifts from us since he is married and that way it was easier for him to open his presents later that night.

The total cost of a new car that needs to be sold by the dealer is $2000.  The price of the car that is being sold by the dealer is the sale amount minus the cost of the car.  The cost of a new car for each dealer is $400.  Then the total of all the cars that he has to sell by the end of the month is $5000.  At the end of the month the owner of the car needs to pay back the sale amount minus the car cost minus the cost of the gas money he used to get to the auction.  Since the $5000 is not the sale price of the car, the dealer can borrow from another dealer or borrow from a mortgage broker using a money market fund (which can be used to create a money market fund of approximately $1500).  Then at the end of the month, the amount that the dealer needs to repurchase his car is $150.

Then the blonde haired boy climbs a similar tree and jumps down. Everyone asks how he did.  They also compare their efforts. Each boy tries climbing a different tree, to do it faster or with greater intensity or both.  Everyone praises the blond haired boy’s performance and congratulates him. When it is time for the black haired boy and his family to come down, all of his other friends clap for him. The boy then climbs the same tree, again reaching his full height.

Everyone tells the blond haired boy how great he was and congratulates him on his performance as well.

They are all very proud as they climb the tree and are all singing the praises of their brother as a hero to the other children. When the bald boy finally comes down, he looks a little down, wondering what all the fuss had been about. But he sees his brother, who is also laughing, jumping around, and he jumps up and starts jumping down with him. They are both jumping up and down, and jumping down, until they are both laughing uncontrollably. Suddenly, the boy stops and looks up at the other children. He tells them that he was the hero, not the blonde, and that he should be in a position of leadership, for being courageous enough to be a hero. Then the girl comes up behind him, and she calls him names and throws things at him.  She begins to cry and to curse him.

The more trees there are in a forest, the more trees there are to support.  The trees in a forest support an area of the forest equal to its area. How many trees are in the forest?<n>Output: 16<n><n>Input: The area of a forest depends upon four things:  1. the area of the forest, 2. the forest's height, 3. the forest's density, and 4. the amount of sunlight received.  The tree's area varies with its height.  The tree with the tallest height in the forest has the most area.  The trees with the smallest areas in the forest have the fewest trees.  Thus the area of the forest with the trees which support the most area is equal to the area of the tree.  The trees which support the smallest areas have the fewest trees to support their area.  So the area of the forest which has the fewest trees to control it's area contains the fewest areas.  So the area with the fewest trees has the most to control its area.  The area with the fewest areas has the least control of its area.  So the areas with the fewest trees contain fewer areas.  The areas with the fewest areas have the fewest number of trees to control.  So the areas which contain the fewest trees have the fewest number trees to control.  Thus the areas which contain the least trees contain the fewest tree's to control.  So to control the area of the forest whose trees comprise the fewest number of areas to control, the individual trees must be thinned out so as to control their area.  So it is clear that the area of a forest will depend upon the number of trees to control it.  If a forest is divided into sections, each section will have a corresponding area dependent on the number of trees to be cut out of the forest which constitute its section.  Thus it is clear that the areas of a forest depend upon the number of individual trees to be cut out. If forests are divided into sections, each individual tree is required to be cut out of a section which has a corresponding area dependent on its area. Thus it is clear that areas of a forest are dependent upon the number of individual tree's to be cut out.  If forests are divided by rivers or streams, each individual tree is also required to be cut out by

Select the amount to get the remaining:<n><n>Income tax withholding is a part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2009.  For those earning under $75,000, they had to check boxes on their tax return that declared their total annual income was under $75,000 and indicated what they should withhold from the total income.  If you earned more, you’ll have to complete the Form 1040 or 1040A to figure out the total amount of income that has to be withheld.  If you’re still a bit confused, use the tool on the IRS website to look up your tax withholdings (and if applicable, what the IRS would have withheld from your paychecks in 2009), including how much you would have actually paid in taxes: http://www.irs.gov/irs-files/pdf/pdfs/2007/08/1040pdfs.pdf<n><n>This is the actual answer.

You may or may not know for certain if the person earned that much money, or the total amount he/she earned could be in excess of $1,500 — perhaps from his/her part-time, supplemental, or side gig. But to calculate those amounts in the $1,750 range, you have to look up or look at the data from an official source.<n>This is the actual result.  Select the amount not only to get the total amount of Social Security paid (whether the income was earned by the family member himself or herself as part of his/her income, or received by the household from an independent worker, or received by the person in charge of another household), but also to get the total Social Security benefit, if that individual will get the benefit, under the new law.<n>This

The sun appears to have a diameter of 70 feet, but it really is about 7.5 feet in diameter.  Does this make this the greatest distance that two stars of similar radius can be separated?  No. The sun is the largest star in the universe.  By definition of average distance, there are 890 other stars larger than the sun. Does the fact that there are billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy mean that it is the largest galaxy in the universe? No.  Stars in the Milky Way galaxy are much smaller than the sun.  By definition of distance, there are 13.1 billion stars smaller than the sun. Does each star take a different amount of time to reach Earth?  No.  It takes the sun about 5.8 hours to reach Earth, so the stars in the galaxy would take about 20 times as long as the sun to reach Earth.  Is the speed of light constant?  No.  Space is not always constant throughout the universe.  It is at the speeds of light that the universe is expanding.  Does it take the sun and other stars that are more massive to reach Earth?  Not necessarily. They tend to go much faster than the speed of light, hence faster than the speed of gravity. What can an individual accomplish in 20 years, in comparison to what would be accomplished in a hundred years by an astronaut?   The speed of light is not directly related to the speed of the person who is traveling though space.  It is

You have learned that magnetism is the attraction of two objects when they are close together and that the force of attraction (called the attractive force) is equal to the force at rest (at rest is equal to zero).  You learn that an object (like a coin) with magnetism (not to be confused with energy) will attract another object with another form of magnetism (not to confuse with momentum).  You also learn that when two oppositely magnetized objects come near one another they will be attracted to one another.  You have learned to differentiate between mass and force.  (Differentiating mass and force is easy; mass has gravity; force does not.)  You also learned that when two magnets are near each other, the ones nearest to each other will be attracted toward each other.  You learned that the force of attraction is equal to the force of rest.  You also learned that an object with higher magnetism (and therefore higher magnetism minus momentum) will attract and pull things closer together.  You learned that an object with more mass will be drawn away from things with less mass.  You also learned to use statistics to estimate the forces or motions of objects.

One day while Mary was making a picture she heard a bird call on the other side of the room. On closer inspection, she discovered that there was a nest of small bird eggs in the picture frame, so she took the picture down.

Their goal was to get about 40 tons of the produce, which was to be distributed to local schools and restaurants. After a month the cabbage was still not finished. A month later, Mary and her neighbors were still not done growing the cabbage. They began cutting the cabbage to be able to store it for winter. Now they have been harvesting the cabbage for several months and it is taking too much room to keep. A group of neighbors was asked to pick up the cabbage at one harvest point and take it home. The neighbors went to the greenhouse and cut the cut cabbage into quarters. A large quantity of the cabbage that had been cut up from the previous harvest was left to ferment. As was typical of their farm, the neighbors began to feel very dissatisfied with the outcome. Then, one of them stopped and asked Mary: “Do you remember the time when this garden had 50 beds and the cabbage could grow almost three feet tall? Why don’t we plant 100 more beds and grow our cabbage taller?” The others smiled, replied, and agreed unanimously. They had planted 100 more beds. It was almost winter and the cabbage was ready to be harvested. Their garden was ready but the cabbage was not. After several days and weeks of waiting, with temperatures dropping, the cabbage began to rot. Finally, the cabbage was collected and brought to school to be used for the next week’s lunch. The cabbage was stored on the way home and later put inside the refrigerator. The teacher said: “Jim, you’ve learned quite a lot on this computer. However, can you ever be sure that your cabbage is going to be ready to use?”<n><n>Inputs(0):<n><n>Outputs(0):<n>1. Find the following sums of 2 + 3: (2 + 4) = 6 + 4 =<n>2.

Each of the 1 and 0 must be separated from other ones by a white space. For example, if you write 1 × 5 = 100, that is 1 × 5 + 2 × 5 = 50.

So each space cannot be 2 1/2, so the answer is 5 × 2.5, then a 1 / 1 = 25.  That’s the number that is required.  Now it’s time to see what happens the more people you add.  And you probably wanted to know how many spaces per word the answer would

He had just loaded the cows when an old man came flying down the lane, screaming, “Hey, you guys go over the fence, get to the other side of the fence – the coyotes’ gonna kill ya!” Joe’s head jerked down.  He grabbed his shotgun, took aim, and pointed it as far to the man’s left as he could.  His shot hit the man square, causing him to drop over the fence. Joe’s shotgun went off again, but this time the man stumbled backwards several feet.  Joe took off after him, but soon he realized that the man was headed away from Joe.  Joe followed him out of sight.  Joe started walking as fast as he knew how, just in case the man came back.  He wasn’t sure, but he might have lost the man…He didn’t have any idea if he could beat the old coyote off the other side of the creek.  Now that the man was out of sight and they had made it across to the other side of those tall fences, he was out of gas.  As he stared at the far side of the creek for a while he thought that it would be better to keep on walking out as far as he could in his current position and wait for a while before he decided whether or not to go back to the ranch and get gas.  But Joe didn’t have that much to say to anyone, let alone someone who was just walking by.  The man was still well out of sight.  As he walked he thought to himself, “I might not have been able to beat those coyotes off that fence if I’d known they were on the other side.” Joe started on his way back down the hill.  Once he got back near the river, he started to panic.  “Is he still dead?”  Now, this was a new concept for Joe. He had his shotgun beside him when he started.  He put it on the ground by his side as he came past a fence.  He decided that maybe if the man came back out of his hiding place he might try to get back at him with one of his shotgun pellets.  He looked over to the other side of that fence.  Joe’s pulse

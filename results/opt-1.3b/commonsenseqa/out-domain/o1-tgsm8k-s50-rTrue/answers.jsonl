Hurley told Richard that he will be there for him and his friends for the rest of their lives. What was the note? Choices: A: blank B: scarce C: dense D: free flowing E: free flowing\nThe final answer is B\n\nAfter his vasectomy, Richard began a new form of training, and he wanted to start it with the group. Richard thought of creating a group to challenge others to reach their goal. He knew that the group would use a leader structure, so he created the leader structure that he thought that would best serve the group.\n\nThe leader structure was two levels, one being the \"core members\" or the \"core group\" which would be made up of the top 3-5 players. The second level would be open to the public. For the first two levels, Richard's plan was to set a number of \"bases\" in the world around each player. He would then invite people with the same number of bases (one per level) to come down to that player\u2019s level and challenge them. When they return to the player's base, it would be their challenge and their own challenge to keep the number of the original base in place. That player would win by using his own number of bases or the number of people who visit his base. For the public levels, Richard would invite anyone to challenge him, and then they would come to his public level every day and be challenged by the other top players. The public games would be free, and that top player would win the prizes that he set aside that day. If the player returns to their base, it would be free, too. So for example, Mark and Richard can each have one public game on their level. If one wins, they can have the other player's public game on their level, too. When that person wins, they have to give that person at least four games that day. However, they can switch to any of Richard's public sessions right then and there.\nRichard could not wait to see who would challenge him to his 1 million dollar prize match at the end of the first week. There were four people. Everyone wanted to go to the first week. Everyone wanted to know who was going to challenge him", "answer": "D: clear"}

He used the Aladdin as a reference.\n\nOutput: Benjy was a happy person, people liked him and they had a lot of friends Ben was kidnapped 12 years ago by Aladdin. James was 15 and Al 15\nNow Benjy and James are 12 and 7 respectively\nTheir age difference 13 years\nTheir combined ages 7 years\nTheir combined age 7 years is 6\nSince the combined ages are 6, I guess that their ages are 65\nSo the final answer was 64\n\nInput:Ace is a very funny guy.

{"text": "Aria, Arizona D: Connecticut\n\nThis is a problem where you can use the idea of a person's time. A problem like this can be solved, for example, by setting to infinity the time limit for that person. The only thing required is that those two numbers are non-negative.\n\nAnswer:Aria, Arizona.\n\nSolution: A couple of things here, both easy. 1. A dial is a piece of mechanical parts and one does not exist, two are connected together and connect the dial. In binary, there is a zero which is called a zero bit. You can think of a zero bit as one bit.\n\n2. An infinite number of cycles are in a dial. In binary, a number starts with 1 or the binary equivalent of 0. In other languages, a number starts with 2 so the binary equivalent of 2 is 0. For example, in binary, 8=9. In other languages, 1=2. In binary, 9 = 17 so the binary equivalent of 17 is 7. So on and so forth. In binary the number that is 1+7=22 and in other languages 1+17=25. In binary the number 8+9=16 and in other languages 15+7=21. So the binary equivalent of 4 +11 = 23 becomes 16 which in binary is 17. But in binary the number 6+6=11 can be written 5+5=10 which in other languages is 12. So a dial works like this: there is a number in there and it is called a dial bit. But it is still one bit. So there is an infinite number of cycle in a dial. In other words, the dial number is just a number. If you run an infinite number of cycles through a dial and take the dial number as a decimal number then it will be a digital number. This is why we talk about fractions, if you could solve the problem using decimal fractions you could compute the dial number and thus solve the problem numerically but it is more accurate to compute the dial number numerically.\n\nOutput:3.Connecticut would work but the first answer would not be right because there are infinite numbers greater than 16.\n4.Aria, Arizona.", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

As a rule of thumb, I should be at least 1.85 in units from the origin, although this varies from point to point in any given equation. Since this is a linear relationship (and we're using units of measure, so we should simplify the equation), we need the derivative to be at least 1.5 times the value of the function, r = (I/d)2 - (r/d). We want to get that as close as possible. Remember that our differential equation is linear, so our derivative should be proportional to the square root of r. (Remember that differential equations should be written like equations because they are supposed to be solved logically.)\nNow, if we want to apply this equation to a point, like in the image below:\n\nWe can use the area of the circle as a measure of its area and multiply the area by its length to get the distance from the origin to the point. Since the area is the square root of two, the answer is (4*(2*pi))+pi = (2x-3*pi) = (2x-12x) = (9*24*72) so we divide 9 by 4 and we're done (the point is located on the circumference, approximately 14.2 degrees from the center).\n\nInput:\n\nInput:\nInput:\nInput\nInput -Input -Input\nInput:\nInput -Input -input\nInput _____________________________________________\nInput:\nInput _____________\nInput", "answer": "A: reality"}

In a diet that requires low-acid diets, the stomach is the last part that people often use to eat certain foods. The acid produced by this acid is citric acid. This acid does not need to be neutralized first. However, it should not be eaten by the stomach, as it contains a strong acid that can be harmful to people who do not know how to handle it. The next stage in the digestive system is the colon. Next is the bicarbonate level, which is called bicarbonate. That acid is neutralized by phosphate and bicarbonate. Then the mucosa, or outer lining, is destroyed. This begins the elimination of waste. Then the mucosa is replaced with the inner lining and the mucosa is repaired.

In this question, we are going to find how many different solutions might be possible, starting with the simplest.\nTo choose the simplest possible answer that gives the correct answer, all of the answers are correct.\nFirst, we divide the answer into two parts. If you split the answer up into two parts you give the correct answer less than 75% of the time. If you give both parts the answer is less than 70% of the time, then you should definitely split the answer.\nAs far as getting the maximum number of correct answers, you will only get them at around 10% accuracy. If you can get at least a 70% accuracy, then you\u2019re guaranteed get at least one correct answer. Remember that you can get 75% accuracy if you find a way to get 75% correct answers on every question.\n\nStep 2:\nSince you know if the number of correct answers is less than 75%, then you can use the following to calculate how many different solutions there are to the multiple choice question.\nMultiply the number of correct answers times the number of correct answers multiplied by the following number. You can give it as a multiple.\nMultiply each answer two times (so for example, if there are 12 correct answers and you get a 5, then multiply it 3.5 times. If there are 50 correct answers and you get 4, then multiply 4 times).\n\nOnce you know the multiple answer solution, then multiply it by the number of correct answers for every question you can get the correct answer for. If you can get the correct responses on each question on the test, then the question is incorrect in every single way.\n\nStep 3:\nOnce you\u2019ve found the answer you want the math section, then multiply it by 10. It can be anything from 0.000001 to 0.00006.", "answer": "E: meet"}

The -2 is not different just because the +1 is.\nThe +2 + 1 is equal to 5 plus the sum of x(1+2). Therefore, the sum of x(2) (1+2) and x(1) = 3, a 3 is not different from 2 but is different from 1. Hence, the +1 is not different but -1 is.\nThe -1 = 7 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 0.\nSo in this situation, the +1 = 7 + \u22122 is different than +0 + 0 = 0.\nThe word change remains the same even in the following examples.\n1+1 + 2 = (1+2) - 2 + 1\n1+1 + 6 = (1+2^6)(2^6)\n1+1 + 3 = (1+2)* (2^9) - 1\n1+1+ 2 = (1+3)* (1+3^2)(2^9)\nInput: 1 +2,2 - 3,3 + 1\nOutput: 1 + 2,3 - 3,1 - 1,2 + 1,3 - 1,2 + 3,2 + 3,1 - -1,3 - 1,3 - 1 + 3,1 - 1 + 3, - -1,3,1 + -1,2,1 + -1.", "answer": "D: read book"}

If the \"pure\" sample is clean, the only other choice is \"dirty\" which makes no sense.\nIf he answers \"pure\", then you need to ask him how he's sure the sample is clean and if he has evidence.

The father also said he would like to see pictures of the decorations in the city, but that's not going to come out just yet!\nThe mother told her kids not to play with the snow, and that they will enjoy the ice skate outside the apartment building. The father advised of just getting a couple more days of snow. He said,\n\"I hope you do, because the weather will be way better by then.\"\nWhen the father asked my dad if he had forgotten all about Christmas, he said,\n\"Of course not!\"\nSo the final Christmas gift exchange is still good!!", "answer": "D: christmas tree"}

He was born in Scotland, but went to Scotland to study law after high school.  His father was a wealthy Scottish businessman and John A. Macdonald's first exposure to business was at the age of 17 when he returned home after six months of living abroad.  He worked in the family company for two years before going off to university.  John A. Macdonald worked in a few businesses before retiring from the federal civil service in 1929.  In 1937 John A. Macdonald became the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, which opposed the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement.  When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister, the Canada-U. S. trade agreement was a disappointment.  In 1978 John A. Macdonald was removed from his position as leader of the Progressive Conservative party.  He went on to become an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberal Party, and became a member of the Progressive Conservative Party when it was formed in the United Province.  The U.S. imposed sanctions against Russia because of the Suez Canal incident in 1967.  Canada and the United States were to develop a trade policy that was less stringent than that of other countries.  The most important issue to Macdonald was the future of the Canadian welfare system.  The social safety net was one of Canada's strengths.  John A. MacDonald wrote: \"For a century we have striven to maintain the best possible social system.  For thirty years we have struggled to maintain the most essential social protection.  And under our welfare system the highest possible standards of living can be maintained for the people and our heritage can be kept up, with the most vigorous encouragement to economic self-improvement.\"\n\n   -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMickael [mailto:michael@alumni.msu.edu]\nSent:\tTuesday, October 31, 2000 2:16 PM\nTo:\tWatson, Kimberly\nSubject:\tRE: Where would a Jewish person live in the area?\n\nKimberly - You know, I have thought about this for a long while now!\n1.

{"text": "you will die when you commit suicide\nHow can this be?\nHow can anything die?\nYou might say you're not really dying when you commit suicide, but I don't believe this is so. Yes, your heart stops beating on suicide, but your body doesn't die because you lack oxygen. As a matter of fact, living cells will continue to do their jobs until your supply of oxygen is exhausted, which you will certainly achieve if you commit suicide. The real question is, why? If your goal is to die and leave nothing behind, wouldn't life still be very nice to have even if you don't? For example, if you die when you commit suicide, you also get to keep your body and mind for much, much longer than if you die naturally.\nAnd how do you know that's not the goal of suicide? Don't you know that the only life you get when you commit suicide is that of a pathetic and pitiful pathetic, pitiful loser? In fact, that's the only true purpose of life in general: to be a pathetic and pitiful loser. That is, if you want to commit suicide, how can you help your chances of a very miserable and pathetic life?\nDon't you know that you, by committing suicide, make a promise to yourself that a life of humiliation, pitiful and pathetic pitiful loserry is the only one you will survive? So therefore, if you live, then you have failed. If you die, then you've won. Why, then, would you commit suicide when you can just as easily live in the pitiful and pitiful and pathetic pitiless and pitiful and pathetic loser that lives inside of you? That's why! And if you live outside of yourself, then you're doomed: only in your own pitiful and pitiful pitiless and pathetic pitiless and pathetic pitiful and pathetic pit miserably and pitiless and pitiless and pitiful pit loser are you a real man. Only in your own pitiful pitiless pitiless and pathetic pitious pitiless pitiless and pitiless loser are you not only a man, but also a real man.\nAnd because you know this, why would you commit suicide at all? The only reason any suicide would be suicidal is to test the validity of his claim and his claim is false. So therefore, why do you commit suicide?

An urban street is far away from residential neighborhoods, even if it consists of many residential neighborhoods.\nAn apartment house is very far away from a residential neighborhood, even if it consists mostly of one or two residential neighborhoods. Many apartment houses consist of one or two neighborhood areas each, and sometimes one or two streets with streets that are very close together. However, many apartment houses contain several neighborhood areas, and these neighborhood areas don't necessarily overlap. As a result of this, an apartment house is much closer to a residential neighborhood than an apartment house is to an urban street or an illegal housing complex.\n- In buildings that are not located in what is usually called an urban/residential zone, such as an illegal housing complex or a small apartment complex, the street is usually a street, the apartments are usually apartments, and the buildings are usually small buildings, such as large apartment houses and apartments that consist of many apartments\n- Some apartment buildings have single or few floors in the upper floors and many floors in the basement. In this case, the street is only about one or two blocks away.", "answer": "A: residential neighborhood"}

Teachers who try to create an environment where these types of activities are meaningful and fun are more likely to maintain students' interest and respect for them as teachers.

The child explains that his father is having a heart attack. The man asks the child, \"How far are you from the hospital?\" The child replies \"I don't know.\" The man replies simply. \"Have you been there often?\" The child's face turned purple, the expression of terror on it was a permanent expression. \"...I have never been to the hospital. And I have never been outside the city limits.\" The boy's father was a policeman, and they had lived in different parts of the borough since they had left school. He had never been able to get a hospital bed for his father in the city. His father had been with him all of his life. The man thought of going home for a quick meal, but was afraid that his father wouldn't be able to find him at home, and if he did not die in time he would soon meet a worse fate. He decided to go to the hospital and see what could be done. He rode down the main street as fast as he could. He came closer to his father's house. He heard the sound of men arguing in another part of the hall. His father had been arguing with a policeman and a doctor. After a while he could feel the man's heart coming back. He was surprised to hear him talking. He could see his father's face. His father was talking too fast. He could not understand what he was saying. What the doctor was saying frightened him even more. His father had been having a heart attack. His heart was not beating properly. The blood was not flowing correctly from his legs where the doctor had made a hole for the ambulance. He was certain that before long the doctors would find out about his father's heart. He thought it might be better if he returned home. His father stopped talking. His father seemed to be afraid. His father looked at him intently. The son asked his father what he was thinking about. Father told his son. He told him that when he heard the doctor's name he was afraid for him that he did not know how far he had come. Father told son that he would not leave him alone in the street, but that he would go home the next time he would leave. He told son that he had never been out of the city limits and had never been in the hospital", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

It can be stated as:\nWeight of all these objects = 1+1/2 = (1-0)/2.\nInput: The only options for this is 1: Richard 2: Hurley 3: office block.\nOutput: 1: Richard = 1/2 = (1+0)/2 = 1.\n\nNow, if all of the objects were stacked on top of each other, the amount of weight would be 1+1/2. However, if the boxes are stacked on top of eachother, the net result would be 1+1 = 0+1. For example, the weight of Richard would be 1+1.\nInput: The answer must be 0 because the result will be 1+1=0.\nOutput: The result will be 1+0=0=0 because the result of 1+1 will be 1.

The teacher tells the other 5 students to get up and stretch and go out into the hallway.\nOutput:\n\nYou can not put a sign on this piece of road that says, \"No bicycles allowed.\" This is because there are bicycles parked on this street during the week. In addition, there is a lot of traffic that would come out of this area.

So, \"Yes, there are bicycles parked on that street during the week because you are not allowed to park on this street during the school year, nor is there space for bicycles on this street during the summer months.\" This is a logical alternative to \"Bicycles are not allowed on this street during summer hours.\"\n\nInput: What will your daughter do with the doll at the end of the rainbow?\nOutput: You will probably get a hug, and then you will have a nice picnic for her.\n\nInput: \"Where is your head?\" asks the teacher, \"It's in the toilet.\"", "answer": "C: torso"}

Therefore, you care about them.

The heart's main function in the human body is to circulate blood by pumping it through the body.\nThe final answer was A\n\nInput: For any given set of particles on the ground, if that set of particles is being pushed at high speed along a straight line, it will accelerate at the same speed but more vigorously compared to if it were being pushed along a perpendicular path.\nOutput: If one has given his particles a mass of 1 pound and they travel at a speed of one mile per second, their speed would be >1 mile per second along the straight line. The acceleration would be greater if they were being pushed along a straight line as opposed to being pushed along a perpendicular one.\nThe final answer would be >A - B = C\n\nOutput: If one is pushing a group of particles along a straight-line at a speed of 200 pounds per foot, while pushing on the top and bottom they will accelerate at the same rate. If they were then to go left and right the accelerating force would increase greatly. So the final answer would be >200 pounds per foot x 20 = 725 pounds per foot\nA higher gravitational pull causes these particles to accelerate less. A lower gravitational pull causes these particles accelerate more.\nInput: For any set of particles on the plane, if that set of particle is being accelerated and is moving at a speed of 2 miles per second faster than any other. If is moving faster than any other particle along the path that they are taking, it will go", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

When Hurley had finished school, he went away with his friends to travel around Canada. While on the island he decided to leave the canoe and paddle for a walk in the forest.

When we came through this forest we went through a forest like a lake that was filled with smoke and now we have to cross that fire to get back to our canoe. And as you cross you will feel your fire burning inside you, like a candle. And if you close up now to cool your fire inside you that smoke will turn black. Then you have to keep going. And when you get down there you will see a dark water in front of you like fire. So don't stop walking until you find a place to sit.

She walks inside her house, and the nurse tells Rose that the nurse has already brought back a pregnant man at the hospital. Rose asks the nurse, \"When is he going to give birth?\" The nurse answers, \"Oh, that will be just fine.\"\nThen as Rose looks around, she realizes that she hasn't stepped inside her house in an eternity of years. So she goes outside to look for her house. She runs all around the house, and when she finally reaches the door, she looks up at all the beautiful flowers all around that door. She notices there is a beautiful picture of herself on the front door of her house. She stands up to look at that picture, and then she starts crying. She turns around and sees the nurse that gave her this picture still lying in bed. Rose can't believe that she's still inside this room. The nurse asks Rose if she feels well. Rose answers, \"Yes,\" and the nurse stands up so she can walk out of this room and go to take a shower.\n\nInput:If somebody comes to your house to pay their respects to Martin Luther King, what do you reply?\nOutput: \"Thank you.\"\n\nInput:Your car breaks down at a rest area.

Without getting tired, we'd be unable to run around and throw things at each other that make a lot of noise. We'd also be unable to run up and down hills so fast because we'd never recover. We'd also be useless at throwing things at each other that don't make a lot of noise because our arms would have collapsed. We're also unable to run up and Down hills so fast because we wouldn't have enough energy to move, and we'd have to use the muscles not used for running downhill.\nAnger is a very important quality if we're planning to throw things at each other without getting tired. If we want to make our opponent's life miserable because of the things we throw, we'll have to use lots of energy to throw a bunch of things and then run. If we manage that, we'll probably look silly doing it because of the way our muscles are designed, but it'll feel great. Anger is also important if we want to be really mean for no reason. A lot of people aren't capable of being mean for no reason, and if they are we can use our muscles, our anger, and our hatred to make our opponent's lives miserable and then run. The combination of all of those things gives us the power over our opponent.\n\nThe person who does the throwing will have to get tired of throwing things at each other. Hurley is not capable of getting tired of throwing things at Hurley because he doesn't have the skills to throw things without getting tired.

I thought about how hard it would be for a 14-year-old to pick from only ten possibilities. But how can we know what the right answer is unless we try to answer every question as they come?\n\nWhy is this on HN?\n\n\"There Are no good answers to the questions\" - Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\nIt is worth remembering that what is important to a person is not necessarily what is meaningful to society. What is meaningful to one individual probably isn't important to another. Therefore, as I said earlier, every question is going to require an answer that is not meaningful to society as a whole.\nI think the OP was merely trying to get people to focus less on the answers to the questions and more on the process of figuring out what \"meaning\" there was in answering them.\nI see your point, but I think it's a bit overdone. And I don't think anyone was asking those sorts of questions -- this was more to ask if there was some sort of underlying rationale to those answers.\n\nI didn't ask how to answer the questions, I asked why HN cared about the answer to each question in the first place. (I believe you are trying to make me see the world as you see it)\n\nRight.

This is because the officer had no incentive to kill off his most reliable officer if the officer died from starvation. Therefore, John the soldier would have been better treated as a slave than as a slave for the officer. This is because slave owners could afford to take the slave away from slave master when the slave master is dying from boredom and frustration. However, the Russian would not have been so lucky because slave Russia is not a country of slaves and therefore, Russia would have to take the risk of taking John away from the Russian officer and giving him to a less reliable officer, rather than risk starvation of the slave and death for a more reliable officer.

The expected number of sets ranges over 0.5 to 2 (where 2 is actually 1), so you can expect to see a combination of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 2, etc., once in a while.\nThe expected probability is as follows:\n0.5-0.5 is a 2-sided, 2-way coin flip, which is much worse than 1-sided, 2- way coin flips because you're not guaranteed an even number of flips before tossing. So the expected number seems to be 2-12 = 6\n1-1 is a 1-sided, 2 way coin flip, which is really terrible for you because your chances of getting the odd numbers are pretty good. So the expected number is 1-12 = 1-1-1\n2-2 is a 1-sided 2 way coin flip, where the chances of getting 1 of each of the numbers of 0, 1, 2 and 3 are much better. So the expected number of sets is 2-7 = 3\n4-4 is a 2-sided 2 way coin roll, where the odds of drawing 1 of each of the 3 numbers of 2, 3 and 2 (if you were unlucky enough to not be drawing 2 or 3) is much worse.

What movie do you prefer?\nOutput:    What are the famous food and movies?  Food is like a movie in Japan. Everybody is so happy to eat some \"yaki\" at \"yaka\", and they go to see the \"kochi\" (fish soup in Japan, I guess) when they come back home to their own family. Of course, the \"yaki\" are delicious, but that's not all about them. It's also about the \"kokou,\" which can be better than any meat you've ever eaten. It's the feeling you feel after eating that \"kochi.\"  The movie is \"Haruhi Suzumiya\", the girl who loves sushi. It's about sushi. It's about one girl who's lost forever. She makes lots of plans, but then the most important one comes to her. She has to learn the way to \"downtown\", which is the town she's in. The rest of her stories are about the main character's new home where she lives and gets introduced to a bunch of people she meets on the way downtown. Sushi is the main character's life at this place. So, sushi is probably one of my favorite food.

{"text": "buy a shelf, have it hang level and balanced. then buy a case for his games.   Bob will now be level 20, 40 years from then has a shelf and a case with games.\n\nThis is not a real scenario, but it illustrates important rules about the ratio of two numbers to the third numbers in a system you are playing (for instance, how long does it take to change the number of cards in a deck of cards? If you change the order in which they are in the deck, how many times do you change the deck?).\n\nIf you have five points, you may only choose one option at a time. The example you have provided is not really a question though, as you did not even know which way to choose. It is better to ask if there are four alternatives and to select the one that has the lowest cost, then write it down. You will need to know how much money you have earned, how much money you will need to earn in order to buy the shelf and the games, and how much time it would take to earn the money. In the example given, your answer may be correct, but not because three different choices had five different prices.\n\nNote the key word \"may\". It is up to you to decide how many times you change the cards in the deck. If you are right, you will have earned the money you need. If you are wrong, then you will have to use that money.\n\nThe main difference between asking how many years are in the ten plus one and this question is that you have to make the choice within a minute, you know only one option at a time will win you, and you have more time to make an informed choice then. The last example would be a stupid one to answer, its kind of a silly question if you know what your doing...\n\nInput: The game is called \"Crazy Taxi\". Suppose you have two characters. Let's say Bob and Hurley. You drive your car around in random directions for twenty minutes, then wait thirty and then another thirty minutes. In that time, Bob earns thirty five dollars.

Choices A: lungs and diastoles B: lungs and abdominal muscles C: abdominal muscles and chest D: lungs with abdominal structures D + chest = lungs + diastoles + abdominal muscles + chest + diastoles + the\nOutput:The chest + the abdominal muscles are the entire body. They take on oxygen as oxygen is needed. Air goes into the lungs to keep them healthy. After that it goes to the diastole. The diastole turns into the lungs again. The lungs take out the last of the oxygen and then pass it on to the next organ.\n\nSolution Preview\n\nTo be able to answer this question you must know some knowledge about what oxygen is and how the lungs \"take in and pass along oxygen\" to the body.\nSince a human takes in oxygen through the muscles, all the muscles of the body will also take in oxygen to make more energy to make the next breath. Therefore taking in and passing out the oxygen is a way for the body to conserve energy for the next breath. The muscles are also connected by other cords that make up the circulatory system.\nIt is also important to know the structure of the lungs because they have some different shapes. They are circular, oval and the most common shape is that of the human heart.\nThe lungs can also have different shapes that you cannot see because they are inside your body. For example, you can not see a lung inside of a chest. Instead they tend to be on the outside of the chest.\nThe lungs are made up of different layers of muscle and tissue called the bronchi. The cells of the bronchi are called epithelial cells and they are formed when these cells are made to make the bronchial tube. These are the cells that help filter and clean the air that the lungs take in during their breaths.\nWhen the air that comes into the lungs passes through the breathing passages, the air reaches the heart that beats to get blood and oxygen to the cells of the bronchi. Also in the body, oxygen carries glucose, which is the sugar that is the fuel of life. The air then passes along to various organs, where more oxygen can", "answer": "B: oxygen"}

They set sail to stop the wheel from falling off, because they would need all of them to be aboard in order to keep the ship's weight from killing the wheel. They then arrived in a small village on the side of a mountain.  When they saw the villagers in their village they found out that the villagers had been keeping out the villagers and the villagers were keeping out the villagers because they were afraid that the villagers were carrying over all the money from Italy with them on the sea journey.

{"text": "If we consider the only way to get information about the world is to get it from books and television, the correct answer is television\nWhere do people traditionally get their information from?\n\nInput: What would the first step of a pyramid scheme be?\nOutput: The first step of a pyramid is to convince the first person that they should make money. So the correct answer is  To convince the first person: To convince the first person:[1] to invest in the pyramid, a new group (e.g., the people asking to do so) will form, and the first person will invest.[2]\nOnce the first person becomes involved, other people will follow.[3]\nEvery so often, a new group of people will be brought into the pyramid scheme, and new people will join the group.[4][5] Eventually each member of the pyramid scheme will invest approximately 100% of their capital plus interest [6][7] in the pyramid.[8][9] In return for the investment, they will all receive a piece of the rewards, and every day they will receive approximately a total of $20 million (at least). So the \"return\" on the investment is that every day they will receive $20 million from the new people they brought into the pyramid, and thus $20 million per day will be invested.[10]\nInput: What makes a pyramid scheme an attractive investment opportunity?\nOutput: The number of new members of a pyramid schemes is typically a function of interest rates.[11] The higher the interest rate, the more people will be attracted to the scheme, and hence the number of members.\nThe same reason that buying stocks made sense in the 50s or 60s is because there was good interest rates. Once interest rates start moving in a different direction, investment opportunities get very difficult to find.\n\nInput: What kind of job is the first step of a job search?

{"text": "B= airplane D=ship's hold E=boat F=car\nIn the airplane example the answer to question A answers E, meaning the airplane example has two options. In the truck example the answer to question D answers F, meaning the truck example has one option. In the boat example the answer to question B answers E, meaning the boat example has only one option.\nQuestion B: The airplane has only the size of the payload of the cargo being sent; hence an airplane can carry no more than 1000 kg of cargo.\nQuestion C: Ships can carry a large amount of cargo at a time. However, their cargo is quite heavy and the ships are much longer than airplanes. Thus, ships carry more cargo than the airplanes but cost a lot more to operate.\nQuestion D: Ships can carry the payload of a number of small cargo containers. Since cargo containers in a ship are stacked they weigh a greater weight than the single cargo container being shipped. Therefore, the ship can carry as many cargo containers as the number of cargo containers being shipped together.\nQuestion E: If you ship 10 containers, each weighing 1000 kg each, you have to ship them individually. A ship can carry up to 20 containers loaded at once. These containers are much lighter than the planes but are far less expensive to operate. Hence, even though ships are expensive to operate they are much more economical than airplanes.\nQuestion F: If you ship 10 container cars, one for each container, the car is a single compartment, but each car is still packed with an equal number of cargo containers. In addition, each car weighs a greater weight. This means that if you ship ten container cars each ship has only a capacity equal to that of the ten container cars.\nQuestion G: If you ship a large number of small containers, each of which weighs 10 kg each, you must use multiple ships. Each ship, each of which carries up to ten containers, is much more costly than one ship carrying a single unit of cargo. Therefore, one ship can neither carry a larger number of units of cargo that one other ship nor can it send smaller amounts of cargo by sea.\nQuestion H: In a ship each container must be attached to a particular piece of equipment. This equipment is heavy and bulky and will require a crane to lift a container to the particular piece of equipment. Therefore, a ship can carry no smaller amount of cargo than that which would require one crane to lift.\nQuestion I: If you ship ten container cars, each weighing", "answer": "A: airplane"}

There are two types of swimming pools:  1) an enclosed pool and 2) open water pools. What would be the purpose for the pool at the public bathhouse? Explanation: Open water pools are safer to use, as someone who drowns in an enclosed pool might drown in the pool they are in while swimming in an open water pool.  2) An enclosed pool can be used as a place to dry out, but the water temperature in open water pools also increases with usage, thus the need for a cooling device. What would be the name and manufacturer of the cooler?\nInput: Why are there people in a bathhouse who are swimming when it's 80 degrees (it is currently the middle of summer and summer in NY is HOT!). It seems counterintuitive to spend so much energy just to be in the water.\nOutput: It is summer, and 80 degrees is not normal.\nTwo people were in the water pool.

The other one is wearing clothes and no rash. What are the odds of the person getting his legs burnt?\nInput: It's currently 86\u00b0!\nOutput: The rash came from having to hold his body weight in the water for a very long time (and also from a rash he got on his legs). Also, the fact one got the rash means neither of them have protection/coverings due to either lack of protection or lack of clothing on these parts of their body.\n\nInput:What is a \"trampoline\"?\nOutput:A place someone jumps that they can't stay on for any length of time.\nOne jump is very", "answer": "D: more funding"}

The reason that they did not die is that they did not know about the water that had already been given them. The reason that they do not know about that water is that they did not use it. The reason that they never use it is because there was not enough. The reason that they used it up is that there still is enough because there will be plenty of it. Now with the invention of the modern water system, the amount of water has increased substantially, and people are beginning to know when they have not got enough. The reason that people do not know when they have not enough is because they did not use it, because they were not able to use it up because there is still a lot of water in rivers. The reason that there is still a lot in rivers is because there is more demand than supply. The reason that there was not enough as there was so much is because it was not used. The reason that there still is not enough is because people were not able to use up the water because there is so much, because there still is too much left.

If (a < B) / [(a > B)][10] is true, the sqrt(10) would become (-10). If (a >= B) / [(a below B)][10] then 10 is not a square root, and so is ((a <= B) / [(a above B)] = 0, and so (a - 10) / [(a above 10)][10] = (a + 0) / [(a - 10)][10] or (a - 10*(a - 10)) / [(a - 10*(8 + 10))][10] = 100. It is likely that (a * 10)*(a - 10) > (a * 10)/(a - 10) = -100 (it will be obvious that a > B when (a + (10 - (10 + 5)))/(a - 10)) = -100). Thus the following sequence of answers seems true: (10 - (10 - 3)) / [(10 - 7)*(10 - 5)) = -100 (10 - 2)*(10 - 5) = 100 (-4) = -80 (10 - 0)*(10 - 5)*(10 - 7) = -10 (-10)*(-10)*(-10)*((10 - (10 - 2)))/(10 - 5) + (5 - 5)*(((5 - 5)*(5 + (10 - 2)))*(10 - 7))/10 * 10) / 10 = -5\n(10 - 8)*(10 - 2)*(5 - 5)*((3 - (5 + 10)))/10 * 10*10 = 10 or (10 - 7)*((9 - (9 - 1)))/10 - (10 - 6)*((9 - (10 - 1)))/10 = -6 - 5*(9 - (9 - 5))/10 = -3 / 10 - 5/10 - 4 / 10 - 3", "answer": "A: sit down"}

What is the best way to keep the temperature from staying below ____ degrees for 10 days?  Output: A radiator B: fireplace C: electric heaters D: fans\n\ninput: I have several of the same object with different features. For instance, my house (at home) has a fireplace, as well as an electric heater. In this case, which is the best?  Output: fireplace B   A fireplace is better than an electric heater, but only if you will be at home. I suggest your best plan be to purchase an electric heater in order to have at least the option of having fire-place, and possibly a furnace in the future. A fireplace is a lot of work for only little to no advantage, and might cause your electric heater to be on non-stop, making it no better than your heater, but more expensive. Your best bet would be a heater that uses gas, and you can control it from the outside.\nThe heating efficiency of electric heaters is pretty variable, so the only way to really say if you actually got a good heat-sink would be to read actual test reports, or compare with gas heaters.\nGas heaters are nice because they are cheap. For instance, they cost 10x more than the electric heating heaters do. Electric heaters are nice because your electric heater only costs $.05 per day, or $.50 per hour.\nAlso, be sure to check the proper electrical wiring at your house. It should be labeled properly. So if you go into the house and use the electric heaters, the correct wire would be labeled properly as well. This would eliminate the problem of the electric heaters being left open. When you are leaving, this will reduce the damage you and your house suffered.\nThe best gas heater would be an electric one. Any electric heater would do, just as long as you do not have a basement or a crawl-space underneath it. Many people use the electric heater in their basement, but only once the walls are finished, or as a last resort. The gas heater would be nice, as you could adjust the amount of heat-sink, and not have it running 24x7. Also, the temperature is very regulated by the gas heater, and", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

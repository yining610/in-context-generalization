Choices:  A: blank B: sparse C: thin D: clear E: free flowing<n>Output:		 The final answer is A<n><n>Input: Hurley was in a bar when Richard, Mark and his friends arrived. When Richard arrived, he gave Hurley a small note, a pen and told him that this is his note for the next 30 years. Hurley told Richard that he will be there for him and his friends for the rest of their lives. What was the note? Choices: A: blank B: scarce C: dense D: free flowing E: free flowing<n>The final answer is B<n><n>After his vasectomy, Richard began a new form of training, and he wanted to start it with the group. Richard thought of creating a group to challenge others to reach their goal. He knew that the group would use a leader structure, so he created the leader structure that he thought that would best serve the group.<n><n>The leader structure was two levels, one being the "core members" or the "core group" which would be made up of the top 3-5 players. The second level would be open to the public. For the first two levels, Richard's plan was to set a number of "bases" in the world around each player. He would then invite people with the same number of bases (one per level) to come down to that player’s level and challenge them. When they return to the player's base, it would be their challenge and their own challenge to keep the number of the original base in place. That player would win by using his own number of bases or the number of people who visit his base. For the public levels, Richard would invite anyone to challenge him, and then they would come to his public level every day and be challenged by the other top players. The public games would be free, and that top player would win the prizes that he set aside that day. If the player returns to their base, it would be free, too. So for example, Mark and Richard can each have one public game on their level. If one wins, they can have the other player's public game on their level, too. When that person wins, they have to give that person at least four games that day. However, they can switch to any of Richard's public sessions right then and there.<n>Richard could not wait to see who would challenge him to his 1 million dollar prize match at the end of the first week. There were four people. Everyone wanted to go to the first week. Everyone wanted to know who was going to challenge him

Choose which of these follows. If the black hole's mass is equal to or greater than the second law of thermodynamics, choose option A (for it), otherwise choose option B (for it). If the black hole's net energy is equal to or greater or equal to or less than the first law of thermodynamic than the first law determines whether it is greater than or equal to the second law. So you're not going to be calculating the mass of a black holes. Choose these sentences. When an atom first falls into the void a nuclear reaction happens. This reaction releases energy in the form of heat. The process of nuclear reactions also releases some of the energy of the element it was making up. But what is released in the process of nuclear reactions is not as significant as the energy released in the process of fusion of the two atoms in a nuclear reactor. Choose these sentences. The first law of thermodynamics states the following: In a chemical reaction, if the total energy released is less energy required to make another chemical element than the amount of energy obtained from combustion, then the chemical reaction is taking place. The second law of thermodynamics states, In a fusion reaction, the total energy is the amount of energy needed to make and destroy. This is how nuclear reactions take place. Choose these sentences.

A problem like this can be solved, for example, by setting to infinity the time limit for that person. The only thing required is that those two numbers are non-negative.<n><n>Answer:Aria, Arizona.<n><n>Solution: A couple of things here, both easy. 1. A dial is a piece of mechanical parts and one does not exist, two are connected together and connect the dial. In binary, there is a zero which is called a zero bit. You can think of a zero bit as one bit.<n><n>2. An infinite number of cycles are in a dial. In binary, a number starts with 1 or the binary equivalent of 0. In other languages, a number starts with 2 so the binary equivalent of 2 is 0. For example, in binary, 8=9. In other languages, 1=2. In binary, 9 = 17 so the binary equivalent of 17 is 7. So on and so forth. In binary the number that is 1+7=22 and in other languages 1+17=25. In binary the number 8+9=16 and in other languages 15+7=21. So the binary equivalent of 4 +11 = 23 becomes 16 which in binary is 17. But in binary the number 6+6=11 can be written 5+5=10 which in other languages is 12. So a dial works like this: there is a number in there and it is called a dial bit. But it is still one bit. So there is an infinite number of cycle in a dial. In other words, the dial number is just a number. If you run an infinite number of cycles through a dial and take the dial number as a decimal number then it will be a digital number. This is why we talk about fractions, if you could solve the problem using decimal fractions you could compute the dial number and thus solve the problem numerically but it is more accurate to compute the dial number numerically.<n><n>Output:3.Connecticut would work but the first answer would not be right because there are infinite numbers greater than 16.<n>4.Aria, Arizona.

As a rule of thumb, I should be at least 1.85 in units from the origin, although this varies from point to point in any given equation. Since this is a linear relationship (and we're using units of measure, so we should simplify the equation), we need the derivative to be at least 1.5 times the value of the function, r = (I/d)2 - (r/d). We want to get that as close as possible. Remember that our differential equation is linear, so our derivative should be proportional to the square root of r. (Remember that differential equations should be written like equations because they are supposed to be solved logically.)<n>Now, if we want to apply this equation to a point, like in the image below:<n><n>We can use the area of the circle as a measure of its area and multiply the area by its length to get the distance from the origin to the point. Since the area is the square root of two, the answer is (4*(2*pi))+pi = (2x-3*pi) = (2x-12x) = (9*24*72) so we divide 9 by 4 and we're done (the point is located on the circumference, approximately 14.2 degrees from the center).<n><n>Input:<n><n>Input:<n>Input:<n>Input<n>Input -Input -Input<n>Input:<n>Input -Input -input<n>Input _____________________________________________<n>Input:<n>Input _____________<n>Input

Choices: A: Icy cold, B: hot C: cold, but hot D: cold<n>Output: There are four types of stomach acid: a. citric acid b. neutralizing phosphoric acid c. neutral phosphoric acid d. strong acids. In a diet that requires low-acid diets, the stomach is the last part that people often use to eat certain foods. The acid produced by this acid is citric acid. This acid does not need to be neutralized first. However, it should not be eaten by the stomach, as it contains a strong acid that can be harmful to people who do not know how to handle it. The next stage in the digestive system is the colon. Next is the bicarbonate level, which is called bicarbonate. That acid is neutralized by phosphate and bicarbonate. Then the mucosa, or outer lining, is destroyed. This begins the elimination of waste. Then the mucosa is replaced with the inner lining and the mucosa is repaired. Then the first part of the gastrointestinal system is the esophagus. Next is the stomach, which has the last part in it and goes directly to the mouth.<n><n>Input:How much does it cost to build an airplane?

In this question, we are going to find how many different solutions might be possible, starting with the simplest.<n>To choose the simplest possible answer that gives the correct answer, all of the answers are correct.<n>First, we divide the answer into two parts. If you split the answer up into two parts you give the correct answer less than 75% of the time. If you give both parts the answer is less than 70% of the time, then you should definitely split the answer.<n>As far as getting the maximum number of correct answers, you will only get them at around 10% accuracy. If you can get at least a 70% accuracy, then you’re guaranteed get at least one correct answer. Remember that you can get 75% accuracy if you find a way to get 75% correct answers on every question.<n><n>Step 2:<n>Since you know if the number of correct answers is less than 75%, then you can use the following to calculate how many different solutions there are to the multiple choice question.<n>Multiply the number of correct answers times the number of correct answers multiplied by the following number. You can give it as a multiple.<n>Multiply each answer two times (so for example, if there are 12 correct answers and you get a 5, then multiply it 3.5 times. If there are 50 correct answers and you get 4, then multiply 4 times).<n><n>Once you know the multiple answer solution, then multiply it by the number of correct answers for every question you can get the correct answer for. If you can get the correct responses on each question on the test, then the question is incorrect in every single way.<n><n>Step 3:<n>Once you’ve found the answer you want the math section, then multiply it by 10. It can be anything from 0.000001 to 0.00006.

What does she feel you must do?<n>Output:You must check on her, but in a different way. If she has an upset stomach, you must ask her what's wrong. If she's got a cold, you must offer her a tissue. If her arm is slightly red and sore, you must scratch it back and forth to make sure it's not infected. In the middle of your work is an object that you can manipulate. A fruit, a water bottle, anything you desire. However, you don't quite have time to really get to grips with it, and therefore the girl in front of you is allowed to do all this on her own. You do this, so the girl in front of her can keep her own hand warm and get some food in her stomach as well. You then head for the kitchen area, where the girl in front has managed to open a jar of jam, so you can pour a bowl of jellied food into a bowl by lifting the lid off the jar and dropping the lid on it.

They do not die at age 22 because Jim died before Lucy died.<n>Lucy and Richard arrive on Mars to see the end of the story of Lucy and James but do not go to Mars to see James die.

Choices:  A: corrupt B: applied C: dirty D: contaminated E: fresh<n>Output:		 C<n>The sample needed to be clean, and then a lab assistant was doing the test. When asked what the sample needed, the lab assistant answered "pure.", not "pure" so the lab assistant was doing some dirty.<n><n>Input:The sum of your answers is A, B, C or D. Which is right?<n>Output: A<n><n>Feedback:If Richard had been tested, his A would be incorrect.<n><n>In some ways the problem is pretty easy. The first thing you should tell yourself is that the lab-assist is "doing dirty". If he was testing the "pure" sample, then the only option you have is to be sure he did a clean test.<n>If the sample is clean, then this was not a corrupt sample, and the next steps need not be explained in the homework. In that case you'd better use the lab assistant's answer. But if the sample is dirty, you want to tell the lab assistant it's dirty.<n>If you think the sample is dirty, ask him which test should be done. If the "pure" sample is clean, the only other choice is "dirty" which makes no sense.<n>If he answers "pure", then you need to ask him how he's sure the sample is clean and if he has evidence. If he answered "pure", then you could choose (1) to test him one more time using a different test, (2), or (3) give him an exam to decide which of three options you thought should be true.<n><n>Your class may not like having its students do the work, but your homework probably says you're not supposed to do the work. You need to explain this in the homework and in class if you're testing the sample.

Choices:  A: work in life B: speak to people C: everywhere D: sitting ideal E: care for people<n>Output:		God wants people to do work in life for money.<n>Also, God would not like people living in cities and going to college. The reason he would want people to only live at country homes is to not allow people to interact with people they're not related to in such a way. And that is part of your god's message. He would prefer not to live in a city, he would prefer to live only with other like minded people and that is why he specifically asks about going to college.<n><n>What does god want people of this country to know?  A: he gave us birthright citizenship B: he saved us from a war that took over a million people C: he created our flag D: he hates guns E: he loves us<n>Output: he only hates guns.<n>he hates all people living on this planet.<n><n>What is god going to do? He wants people to be saved, he wants them to know that he is their savior. He wants them to live by a set of laws, which is why everything he commands us to do becomes legal. He also commands us to live out our lives in loving ways.. which is why all of the above are a part of what God asks us to do. We all have birthright citizenship. We all speak to people all the time and we all live near each other. God's voice is heard every day. You really have to look and believe. The whole bible and all the teachings in it is about the same thing. A love filled life. A love filled world. The bible does not say anything negative about anything. There seems to always be something positive to say about every subject. If god knew that everyone hated him and would rather we all die then he would not have given us birthright citizenship in the first place. If someone truly hated god, they would not have it so nice. God also loves us, and we are saved because he loves us.<n>We are all saved through salvation. The whole bible has nothing to say negative about the other subjects. Our freedom is something we are given every day. Jesus had to sacrifice himself for us. God did not want us to die by his hand. His way was not just but it was just because of how he felt about us, and he loved us so much.<n><n>What is the difference between being an atheist and a sinner.  A: I don't know you to answer.

John A. Macdonald worked in a few businesses before retiring from the federal civil service in 1929.  In 1937 John A. Macdonald became the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, which opposed the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement.  When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister, the Canada-U. S. trade agreement was a disappointment.  In 1978 John A. Macdonald was removed from his position as leader of the Progressive Conservative party.  He went on to become an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberal Party, and became a member of the Progressive Conservative Party when it was formed in the United Province.  The U.S. imposed sanctions against Russia because of the Suez Canal incident in 1967.  Canada and the United States were to develop a trade policy that was less stringent than that of other countries.  The most important issue to Macdonald was the future of the Canadian welfare system.  The social safety net was one of Canada's strengths.  John A. MacDonald wrote: "For a century we have striven to maintain the best possible social system.  For thirty years we have struggled to maintain the most essential social protection.  And under our welfare system the highest possible standards of living can be maintained for the people and our heritage can be kept up, with the most vigorous encouragement to economic self-improvement."<n><n>   -----Original Message-----<n>From: 	Mickael [mailto:michael@alumni.msu.edu]<n>Sent:	Tuesday, October 31, 2000 2:16 PM<n>To:	Watson, Kimberly<n>Subject:	RE: Where would a Jewish person live in the area?<n><n>Kimberly - You know, I have thought about this for a long while now!<n>1.

Choices:  A: scars B: being born C: sorrow D: misery E: kill yourself<n>Output:		 you will die when you commit suicide<n>How can this be?<n>How can anything die?<n>You might say you're not really dying when you commit suicide, but I don't believe this is so. Yes, your heart stops beating on suicide, but your body doesn't die because you lack oxygen. As a matter of fact, living cells will continue to do their jobs until your supply of oxygen is exhausted, which you will certainly achieve if you commit suicide. The real question is, why? If your goal is to die and leave nothing behind, wouldn't life still be very nice to have even if you don't? For example, if you die when you commit suicide, you also get to keep your body and mind for much, much longer than if you die naturally.<n>And how do you know that's not the goal of suicide? Don't you know that the only life you get when you commit suicide is that of a pathetic and pitiful pathetic, pitiful loser? In fact, that's the only true purpose of life in general: to be a pathetic and pitiful loser. That is, if you want to commit suicide, how can you help your chances of a very miserable and pathetic life?<n>Don't you know that you, by committing suicide, make a promise to yourself that a life of humiliation, pitiful and pathetic pitiful loserry is the only one you will survive? So therefore, if you live, then you have failed. If you die, then you've won. Why, then, would you commit suicide when you can just as easily live in the pitiful and pitiful and pathetic pitiless and pitiful and pathetic loser that lives inside of you? That's why! And if you live outside of yourself, then you're doomed: only in your own pitiful and pitiful pitiless and pathetic pitiless and pathetic pitiful and pathetic pit miserably and pitiless and pitiless and pitiful pit loser are you a real man. Only in your own pitiful pitiless pitiless and pathetic pitious pitiless pitiless and pitiless loser are you not only a man, but also a real man.<n>And because you know this, why would you commit suicide at all? The only reason any suicide would be suicidal is to test the validity of his claim and his claim is false. So therefore, why do you commit suicide? The only reason any suicidal person will commit suicide is to find out how the claim is false. Therefore, suicide is never suicide and suicide is

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input:A school is most likely to be located in what sort of zone? Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: community C: building D: prague E: every city<n>Output:		A school is most definitely located in a residential zone. A school is most definitely located very close to a residential area. A school (presumably one that accepts students) is most definitely located far far in a residential zone. Every city except prague is definitely located in a residential or urban zone. Every building not definitely located in a residential/urban zone is definitely located in a building with a residential or urban zone in it (presumably either a single family home, a townhouse apartment complex or a hotel). Finally a street is most definitely located in an urban area (presumably in a populated or densely populated area).<n><n>Solution text:<n>---------------------------------------------<n>- In an urban area, streets are much more likely to be very close to residential areas then streets are to be very far from residential areas<n>- In an urban street, residential areas on both sides will be very close together<n>- In an urban/residential neighborhood, residential areas on either side near the street will be very close together, and will be surrounded by residential areas on either sides<n>- In an urban-residential neighborhood, residential neighborhoods on both sides near the street will be far apart and separated by only a few streets<n><n>An urban street is very close to a residential neighborhood, just like an urban and residential street are very close together. There may even be a residential school within the residential neighborhood, but the school won't usually be close to the street. An urban street is far away from residential neighborhoods, even if it consists of many residential neighborhoods.<n>An apartment house is very far away from a residential neighborhood, even if it consists mostly of one or two residential neighborhoods. Many apartment houses consist of one or two neighborhood areas each, and sometimes one or two streets with streets that are very close together. However, many apartment houses contain several neighborhood areas, and these neighborhood areas don't necessarily overlap. As a result of this, an apartment house is much closer to a residential neighborhood than an apartment house is to an urban street or an illegal housing complex.<n>- In buildings that are not located in what is usually called an urban/residential zone, such as an illegal housing complex or a small apartment complex, the street is usually a street, the apartments are usually apartments, and the buildings are usually small buildings, such as large apartment houses and apartments that consist of many apartments<n>- Some apartment buildings have single or few floors in the upper floors and many floors in the basement. In this case, the street is only about one or two blocks away.

There are many activities that children love, and in fact, you might consider doing a group project

The child explains that his father is having a heart attack. The man asks the child, "How far are you from the hospital?" The child replies "I don't know." The man replies simply. "Have you been there often?" The child's face turned purple, the expression of terror on it was a permanent expression. "...I have never been to the hospital. And I have never been outside the city limits." The boy's father was a policeman, and they had lived in different parts of the borough since they had left school. He had never been able to get a hospital bed for his father in the city. His father had been with him all of his life. The man thought of going home for a quick meal, but was afraid that his father wouldn't be able to find him at home, and if he did not die in time he would soon meet a worse fate. He decided to go to the hospital and see what could be done. He rode down the main street as fast as he could. He came closer to his father's house. He heard the sound of men arguing in another part of the hall. His father had been arguing with a policeman and a doctor. After a while he could feel the man's heart coming back. He was surprised to hear him talking. He could see his father's face. His father was talking too fast. He could not understand what he was saying. What the doctor was saying frightened him even more. His father had been having a heart attack. His heart was not beating properly. The blood was not flowing correctly from his legs where the doctor had made a hole for the ambulance. He was certain that before long the doctors would find out about his father's heart. He thought it might be better if he returned home. His father stopped talking. His father seemed to be afraid. His father looked at him intently. The son asked his father what he was thinking about. Father told his son. He told him that when he heard the doctor's name he was afraid for him that he did not know how far he had come. Father told son that he would not leave him alone in the street, but that he would go home the next time he would leave. He told son that he had never been out of the city limits and had never been in the hospital

The teacher tells the other 5 students to get up and stretch and go out into the hallway.<n>Output:<n><n>You can not put a sign on this piece of road that says, "No bicycles allowed." This is because there are bicycles parked on this street during the week. In addition, there is a lot of traffic that would come out of this area. Also, if there were to be bicycles on this street, the school administration would probably ban bicycles in that area of the school. So, "Yes, there are bicycles parked on that street during the week because you are not allowed to park on this street during the school year, nor is there space for bicycles on this street during the summer months." This is a logical alternative to "Bicycles are not allowed on this street during summer hours."<n><n>Input: What will your daughter do with the doll at the end of the rainbow?<n>Output: You will probably get a hug, and then you will have a nice picnic for her.<n><n>Input: "Where is your head?" asks the teacher, "It's in the toilet."<n>

Also, if you play at the violin, then other people are more likely to give you positive comments and thus make your violin playing better.<n>Another option: if you play very badly, then some of them will not notice it and will not care.<n>However, with that said, if there is no one to care, and you care to not care, then you're likely to lose most of friends due to not caring, and to never have fun.<n>I think that by not caring, you make friends, because friends care about each other. Therefore, you care about them. To have friends that care also makes you more confident and thus makes one want to talk to you.<n>In any case, you could play both ways, and not have happiness be your priority choice.<n><n>input:How many days does it take to change your hair color?<n>Output: What is a day made of?

When Hurley had finished school, he went away with his friends to travel around Canada. While on the island he decided to leave the canoe and paddle for a walk in the forest. He began to walk to the edge of the forest and to think of his friends. Hurley walked ahead of him and noticed that the trees grew darker and the forest changed from lush green to dead and burned out. The forest became darker.

Then he saw another fire that was on the edge of the forest. He saw that there was a way off the edge of this fire and he walked ahead of Hurley and went through this forest, coming to a place with water and a boat. Just when Rich wanted to give up, he found a way back to his canoe. He walked into the

Without getting tired, we'd be unable to run around and throw things at each other that make a lot of noise. We'd also be unable to run up and down hills so fast because we'd never recover. We'd also be useless at throwing things at each other that don't make a lot of noise because our arms would have collapsed. We're also unable to run up and Down hills so fast because we wouldn't have enough energy to move, and we'd have to use the muscles not used for running downhill.<n>Anger is a very important quality if we're planning to throw things at each other without getting tired. If we want to make our opponent's life miserable because of the things we throw, we'll have to use lots of energy to throw a bunch of things and then run. If we manage that, we'll probably look silly doing it because of the way our muscles are designed, but it'll feel great. Anger is also important if we want to be really mean for no reason. A lot of people aren't capable of being mean for no reason, and if they are we can use our muscles, our anger, and our hatred to make our opponent's lives miserable and then run. The combination of all of those things gives us the power over our opponent.<n><n>The person who does the throwing will have to get tired of throwing things at each other. Hurley is not capable of getting tired of throwing things at Hurley because he doesn't have the skills to throw things without getting tired. Hurley wants to keep fighting, so he's not going to stop throwing things at his opponent. He's too competitive, and his hands are too tired. When Hurley catches his opponent, Richard is angry at Hurley because he's going to try and hurt Hurley and then run like he just conquered the world. Hurley's fight is going to be long and frustrating, and Richard isn't going to be able to keep his cool.<n><n>So the final answer in the puzzle is the following.<n><n>Input: Hurley needs to become stronger if Richard wants to win. What do we do to make him become stronger? Output: Hurley needs to be stronger.<n>Rich needs to be stronger to make Hurley stronger. Richard can't make Hur

In game A, three of the players will draw two cards every turn. At the end of the game you will draw a card. If you draw the same card but different from your opponent, you will draw a completely different card. To see two different cards, you will be required to draw three additional cards. If you draw one card in a two-card sequence, you will draw another card in the following two-card sequence. You will also draw one additional card if, after drawing two cards in a two-card order, you cannot recognize the card whose order you drew. If you recognize a card whose order you drew which is different than the one you drew at the start of the sequence, you will draw a third card.<n><n>Output:You draw an additional card if you cannot recognize a card whose order is different from that of your opponent's. You can only draw one additional card if you know the order of cards of your opponent. You can only draw three additional cards if you know the order in which you drew your own card, and if all other combinations are wrong. If you do not recognize a card that you cannot recognize, you will draw one additional card which has the same order as your starting card, and you can then draw a new third card. If you draw a card in the three-card sequence but do not know the order of the other cards, you will draw a fourth card that has the same order as a third card and the fourth card in a three-card sequence. If you draw a fourth card in the three card sequence but do not know which order of cards you drew at the start, you draw a fifth card, whose order of cards is the same as or different from that of

This is because the officer had no incentive to kill off his most reliable officer if the officer died from starvation. Therefore, John the soldier would have been better treated as a slave than as a slave for the officer. This is because slave owners could afford to take the slave away from slave master when the slave master is dying from boredom and frustration. However, the Russian would not have been so lucky because slave Russia is not a country of slaves and therefore, Russia would have to take the risk of taking John away from the Russian officer and giving him to a less reliable officer, rather than risk starvation of the slave and death for a more reliable officer. Slaves are a threat to any country because their numbers make an officer's decisions in any given military decision extremely complicated.

For example, if population in a town is X, and you have two groups; one with a mean of 10 and the other with an average of 0, then the number of people needed in the population control group is N*X, where N is the number of people with a mean of 10. The result in this example is the population control group has 50/100 people. This is done by making the mean of the total population of the town be zero, which means there will always be 10 people in your town. If N is a very large number (like 1000 or 2000), you’d likely need more people to control the population in order to bring it under control.<n><n>Input:What would be the reaction by an American to someone who called herself "Cookie"?<n>Output:Cookie is no different from other women<n><n>Input:What kind of person has a very low opinion of most food?<n>Output:A very low opinion of other people's food<n><n>Input:What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you think about fat people?

Output:<n><n>Output:What is the probability of getting a different answer every time we start the game, assuming that we can choose at least one correct answer at random?<n><n>Input:The number of sets of dice in a deck (in other words, the number of different dices from which to draw a given set of cards) is exactly one. If it were not, then you would have to draw more than just one set of cards each game. What is the expected value of the expected number of sets?<n>Output:It is an open question. The expected number of sets ranges over 0.5 to 2 (where 2 is actually 1), so you can expect to see a combination of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 2, etc., once in a while.<n>The expected probability is as follows:<n>0.5-0.5 is a 2-sided, 2-way coin flip, which is much worse than 1-sided, 2- way coin flips because you're not guaranteed an even number of flips before tossing. So the expected number seems to be 2-12 = 6<n>1-1 is a 1-sided, 2 way coin flip, which is really terrible for you because your chances of getting the odd numbers are pretty good. So the expected number is 1-12 = 1-1-1<n>2-2 is a 1-sided 2 way coin flip, where the chances of getting 1 of each of the numbers of 0, 1, 2 and 3 are much better. So the expected number of sets is 2-7 = 3<n>4-4 is a 2-sided 2 way coin roll, where the odds of drawing 1 of each of the 3 numbers of 2, 3 and 2 (if you were unlucky enough to not be drawing 2 or 3) is much worse. So the expected number can be as high as 5<n>5-5 is a 2-way 2-way coin toss, where the chances of drawing 1 of each number of 1, 4 and 3 are very good, so the expected

Then when I came across “tradesman,” I wrote down why a tradesman was a tradesman and not a cook. Thank you very much, partner.

And when you have power, people like you a lot.  This power comes in very useful in many things, to be sure, but as a rule, it also means that you have a lot of work to do.  Most people never seem to have anything to do, in fact.  That's often because they don't have power.  Power comes in three different forms, of course:  money, reputation, and power.  When people have money and reputation, you can count on them to do a lot of work for you.  When they have the power to make some big changes, then, yes, they will also start a whole lot of shit.  As a general rule, people aren't too stupid to understand that your job is the most important thing in your life, really.<n>2) It is the most valuable job in the world only because people think that money is the most valuable thing in the world.  The only reason why being employed in the work of law is so popular is because people think that this is the money most people in the world ever make.

Name of your favorite movie.     Name the most famous food.    Name a movie that's most famous in its country of origin.    Name the food.    What movie do you prefer?<n>Output:    What are the famous food and movies?  Food is like a movie in Japan. Everybody is so happy to eat some "yaki" at "yaka", and they go to see the "kochi" (fish soup in Japan, I guess) when they come back home to their own family. Of course, the "yaki" are delicious, but that's not all about them. It's also about the "kokou," which can be better than any meat you've ever eaten. It's the feeling you feel after eating that "kochi."  The movie is "Haruhi Suzumiya", the girl who loves sushi. It's about sushi. It's about one girl who's lost forever. She makes lots of plans, but then the most important one comes to her. She has to learn the way to "downtown", which is the town she's in. The rest of her stories are about the main character's new home where she lives and gets introduced to a bunch of people she meets on the way downtown. Sushi is the main character's life at this place. So, sushi is probably one of my favorite food. Probably no film is not very famous in Japan.<n><n>Input:What do you do and who do you spend your weekends with?

Choices A: lungs and diastoles B: lungs and abdominal muscles C: abdominal muscles and chest D: lungs with abdominal structures D + chest = lungs + diastoles + abdominal muscles + chest + diastoles + the<n>Output:The chest + the abdominal muscles are the entire body. They take on oxygen as oxygen is needed. Air goes into the lungs to keep them healthy. After that it goes to the diastole. The diastole turns into the lungs again. The lungs take out the last of the oxygen and then pass it on to the next organ.<n><n>Solution Preview<n><n>To be able to answer this question you must know some knowledge about what oxygen is and how the lungs "take in and pass along oxygen" to the body.<n>Since a human takes in oxygen through the muscles, all the muscles of the body will also take in oxygen to make more energy to make the next breath. Therefore taking in and passing out the oxygen is a way for the body to conserve energy for the next breath. The muscles are also connected by other cords that make up the circulatory system.<n>It is also important to know the structure of the lungs because they have some different shapes. They are circular, oval and the most common shape is that of the human heart.<n>The lungs can also have different shapes that you cannot see because they are inside your body. For example, you can not see a lung inside of a chest. Instead they tend to be on the outside of the chest.<n>The lungs are made up of different layers of muscle and tissue called the bronchi. The cells of the bronchi are called epithelial cells and they are formed when these cells are made to make the bronchial tube. These are the cells that help filter and clean the air that the lungs take in during their breaths.<n>When the air that comes into the lungs passes through the breathing passages, the air reaches the heart that beats to get blood and oxygen to the cells of the bronchi. Also in the body, oxygen carries glucose, which is the sugar that is the fuel of life. The air then passes along to various organs, where more oxygen can

Africa<n>A forest can support up to 5,000 lions, if the number is doubled, its total number will be 10,000.<n>The number of lions in Africa today (more than 2.8 million) is the result of a conservation effort spearheaded by the International League for Conservation of Nature.<n>This league was founded in 1949 by an American ecologist, Dr. Louis Redfield (1895-1938) on the continent’s west coast, with the objective of saving Africa’s lions from the threat of extinction in the latter part of the 20th century.<n>The International League of Conservation of Nature is a non-profit organization, dedicated to the protection and conservation of endangered wildlife, including lions.<n>Many other countries are actively involved, in Africa and around the world, in the same cause. Most of these organizations have been around for many decades, but the League has remained the only one with a long enough history to count all its members since its founding in 1948.<n>The International League is today comprised of a cross-section of people and groups worldwide, making up over 100 organizations. These include conservation and development organizations, academic institutions, religious leaders, researchers, journalists and governments.<n>The League works with governments concerned about conservation of wild animals and the livelihoods of their people. The League’s work in particular includes conservation and management planning of national parks, protected areas, national parks managed for tourism, private wild areas and protected areas administered on behalf of governments.<n>The League’s Conservation Program works to conserve Africa’s natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen national conservation systems. A key feature of the League’s Conservation Programs is their emphasis on strengthening national human communities, through employment, education, health and environmental services.<n>The League‘s Conservation Training Program has been training thousands of national and international volunteers for the last 25 years, in countries including Kenya, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Botswana and Uganda.<n>A typical trained volunteer works for a local organization for 6-12 months, providing technical assistance in various areas of animal management.<n>The League uses the World Wide Fund for Nature, the United States Government (USG) and its National Wildlife Services (NWS) to provide lions in North America with protection, and the World Wide Fund for Wildlife to provide lions in Africa with health and rehabilitation services.<n>The League also uses the USG to obtain funding for their Wildlife Conservation, and to secure international cooperation in

Choices:  A: footloose B: sailing C: fast D: tighten E: bind<n>Output:		The wheel was loose and threatened to fall off, when they were all four on board, and they were headed to Europe.  They were sailing faster than they usually sailed because they decided to start the journey early, before the winds were too strong to get the ship over the Alps to Italy.  They set sail to stop the wheel from falling off, because they would need all of them to be aboard in order to keep the ship's weight from killing the wheel. They then arrived in a small village on the side of a mountain.  When they saw the villagers in their village they found out that the villagers had been keeping out the villagers and the villagers were keeping out the villagers because they were afraid that the villagers were carrying over all the money from Italy with them on the sea journey.  They then went out on to the village to ask about getting an extra room to put the extra money they had from Italy in, since they would be going to another country and the money would be needed.  The people in the village then told them that they have all the rooms for people for themselves and the crew of the ship.  They gave it to them to keep as their own.<n><n>Input:Three hundred years from now, where will all the great things have been invented? Options:? What they would invent?

So the correct answer is  To convince the first person: To convince the first person:[1] to invest in the pyramid, a new group (e.g., the people asking to do so) will form, and the first person will invest.[2]<n>Once the first person becomes involved, other people will follow.[3]<n>Every so often, a new group of people will be brought into the pyramid scheme, and new people will join the group.[4][5] Eventually each member of the pyramid scheme will invest approximately 100% of their capital plus interest [6][7] in the pyramid.[8][9] In return for the investment, they will all receive a piece of the rewards, and every day they will receive approximately a total of $20 million (at least). So the "return" on the investment is that every day they will receive $20 million from the new people they brought into the pyramid, and thus $20 million per day will be invested.[10]<n>Input: What makes a pyramid scheme an attractive investment opportunity?<n>Output: The number of new members of a pyramid schemes is typically a function of interest rates.[11] The higher the interest rate, the more people will be attracted to the scheme, and hence the number of members.<n>The same reason that buying stocks made sense in the 50s or 60s is because there was good interest rates.

Choices:  A: rain forest B: tree tops C: toy store D: zoological gardens E: great outdoors<n>Output:		 If the monkey is in a zoo the zoo could sell a captive to a drug dealer. If the monkey was in a toy store then it was purchased by an honest buyer, who left it at the toy store, where it would later get taken home and sold again. When the toy store was raided by the police, the monkey would be caught in the police raid. The monkey will be arrested and charged with dealing drugs. The monkey will plead guilty because he didn't know that he was being sold a captive. He will be sentenced to life in prison, and he will also get a 25 year minimum sentence for having a criminal enterprise. But because the monkey pleaded guilty to not knowing what he was being sold, he will still be allowed to go to work as a zookeeper. He will now be at work every day, but his bosses will now know that he has no idea what the prisoners are being sold. The prison's food will now be made from human food scraps and will come into the prisoner's cells every day. So, from the prisoners point of view, they will be able to have very little contact with each other, as they will mostly be separated by an animal from each other.

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n>Output:		B= airplane D=ship's hold E=boat F=car<n>In the airplane example the answer to question A answers E, meaning the airplane example has two options. In the truck example the answer to question D answers F, meaning the truck example has one option. In the boat example the answer to question B answers E, meaning the boat example has only one option.<n>Question B: The airplane has only the size of the payload of the cargo being sent; hence an airplane can carry no more than 1000 kg of cargo.<n>Question C: Ships can carry a large amount of cargo at a time. However, their cargo is quite heavy and the ships are much longer than airplanes. Thus, ships carry more cargo than the airplanes but cost a lot more to operate.<n>Question D: Ships can carry the payload of a number of small cargo containers. Since cargo containers in a ship are stacked they weigh a greater weight than the single cargo container being shipped. Therefore, the ship can carry as many cargo containers as the number of cargo containers being shipped together.<n>Question E: If you ship 10 containers, each weighing 1000 kg each, you have to ship them individually. A ship can carry up to 20 containers loaded at once. These containers are much lighter than the planes but are far less expensive to operate. Hence, even though ships are expensive to operate they are much more economical than airplanes.<n>Question F: If you ship 10 container cars, one for each container, the car is a single compartment, but each car is still packed with an equal number of cargo containers. In addition, each car weighs a greater weight. This means that if you ship ten container cars each ship has only a capacity equal to that of the ten container cars.<n>Question G: If you ship a large number of small containers, each of which weighs 10 kg each, you must use multiple ships. Each ship, each of which carries up to ten containers, is much more costly than one ship carrying a single unit of cargo. Therefore, one ship can neither carry a larger number of units of cargo that one other ship nor can it send smaller amounts of cargo by sea.<n>Question H: In a ship each container must be attached to a particular piece of equipment. This equipment is heavy and bulky and will require a crane to lift a container to the particular piece of equipment. Therefore, a ship can carry no smaller amount of cargo than that which would require one crane to lift.<n>Question I: If you ship ten container cars, each weighing

It's a good place to challenge yourself to think creatively when working with questions that have no clear answers right off the bat. Be careful not to limit your answers to one option in case you're reading multiple questions and need some extra information or perspective (e.g. You have two choices B and C, so you might as well give all the details with option A to get an answer that has both answers as well). The answers may not add up initially, but will when you put them all together and use logic to figure out what the answers should be.<n><n>Input:What company makes a large container for storing loose documents that have to be organized in some way?

You'll get a number of different answers, none of which are wrong. Each answer gives you something to think and discuss with others (e.g. The money is $3.1M, the year is 1980, the time is the 1980's). It's a good way to break out of the thinking box, and it helps hone critical thinking skills

There are two types of swimming pools:  1) an enclosed pool and 2) open water pools. What would be the purpose for the pool at the public bathhouse? Explanation: Open water pools are safer to use, as someone who drowns in an enclosed pool might drown in the pool they are in while swimming in an open water pool.  2) An enclosed pool can be used as a place to dry out, but the water temperature in open water pools also increases with usage, thus the need for a cooling device. What would be the name and manufacturer of the cooler?<n>Input: Why are there people in a bathhouse who are swimming when it's 80 degrees (it is currently the middle of summer and summer in NY is HOT!).

Also, the fact one got the rash means neither of them have protection/coverings due to either lack of protection or lack of clothing on these parts of their body.<n><n>Input:What is a "trampoline"?<n>Output:A place someone jumps that they can't stay on for any length of time.<n>One jump is very

Choose the answer that best describes your thinking on the question above.<n>Solution: If you have a pen and a piece of paper, you can write what you just said. When you're done writing, you keep the paper and pen and write what you just said again. But what does this writing do? For example, if you write "At exactly where is the sunsetting each fall?" on your paper, what's the answer? Because you've already written about where it sets, what is the other answer? What if you write "Golden Gate," which isn't right? What if you write, "Marin Headlands," which isn't right either?<n>So the answer isn't very specific. It tells you about the way the question is asked, and maybe about the way the writer thinks about certain kinds of questions.<n><n>Input:Each class should have an essay question, and a two-part essay. Write a long essay response to the paper about your choice.

The second part should be "what you think you're missing out on by NOT having an essay question." If you wrote the first essay correctly, you will write the second one correctly.<n><n>Input: A girl was trying to buy a shirt with her boyfriend at the tailor shop.

So in this case the number given for question number three must be less than the value given for question number five. If the number given for question three is more than question number five and for question number four, the number given for question four must be more than the number given for question five, so in this case the sum of the answers given for three and four is less than the sum of the answers for five and six. Do not use the sum of three and four. Write the values directly as 3+4 if they are less than the sum of three and 4+3 if they are more than the sum of four.<n>Input:25-3+3-4 = 30 Input: 25-3+4 = 30 Input:<n>20+30

Choices: D: subway station E: mall<n>Output: C<n><n>Input: In the past, the amount of water in rivers in the world was so small, that all people died of thirst before water became scarce, and no more people appeared. The reason that they did not die is that they did not know about the water that had already been given them. The reason that they do not know about that water is that they did not use it. The reason that they never use it is because there was not enough. The reason that they used it up is that there still is enough because there will be plenty of it. Now with the invention of the modern water system, the amount of water has increased substantially, and people are beginning to know when they have not got enough. The reason that people do not know when they have not enough is because they did not use it, because they were not able to use it up because there is still a lot of water in rivers. The reason that there is still a lot in rivers is because there is more demand than supply. The reason that there was not enough as there was so much is because it was not used. The reason that there still is not enough is because people were not able to use up the water because there is so much, because there still is too much left. People know when they are not going to have enough water because the water system has made them aware, and they will begin to use less and less.

If (a < B) / [(a > B)][10] is true, the sqrt(10) would become (-10). If (a >= B) / [(a below B)][10] then 10 is not a square root, and so is ((a <= B) / [(a above B)] = 0, and so (a - 10) / [(a above 10)][10] = (a + 0) / [(a - 10)][10] or (a - 10*(a - 10)) / [(a - 10*(8 + 10))][10] = 100. It is likely that (a * 10)*(a - 10) > (a * 10)/(a - 10) = -100 (it will be obvious that a > B when (a + (10 - (10 + 5)))/(a - 10)) = -100). Thus the following sequence of answers seems true: (10 - (10 - 3)) / [(10 - 7)*(10 - 5)) = -100 (10 - 2)*(10 - 5) = 100 (-4) = -80 (10 - 0)*(10 - 5)*(10 - 7) = -10 (-10)*(-10)*(-10)*((10 - (10 - 2)))/(10 - 5) + (5 - 5)*(((5 - 5)*(5 + (10 - 2)))*(10 - 7))/10 * 10) / 10 = -5<n>(10 - 8)*(10 - 2)*(5 - 5)*((3 - (5 + 10)))/10 * 10*10 = 10 or (10 - 7)*((9 - (9 - 1)))/10 - (10 - 6)*((9 - (10 - 1)))/10 = -6 - 5*(9 - (9 - 5))/10 = -3 / 10 - 5/10 - 4 / 10 - 3

The answer is: 6.<n><n>In the example, the text said that there are 6 "A's" of the text, and that there are 30 words in total. The characters were selected on the basis of how often they appear. The characters of A do 6 times more "A's" than A. Also, the 'E' appears 5 times, and the 'T' appears once. Therefore, there are 6 'A's' of the text, and 30 words in total.<n><n>As an example, consider the following characters found in the text (6 lines):<n>a<n>e<n>g<n>o<n>k<n>c<n>s<n>r<n>a<n>e<n>a<n>m<n>n<n>p<n>u<n>g<n>o<n>g<n>s<n>m<n>n<n>t<n>o<n><n>To represent these characters, the total number of words in this text is 60 because the characters are so commonly used.<n><n>[00:16:52:]<n><n>The above example clearly shows that a word cannot contain 6 letters, unless it's a contraction. Also it was clear that 6 is the limit of this text. Hence, 6 is the limit that every character in this text can be used. Hence, the limit is not 10. Hence it is obvious that at least 10 characters cannot be in any word or sentence.<n><n>Since 60 is the maximum number, the word or sentence containing those 60 characters might go by the number:<n><n>61<n><n>In the above example, the word or sentence that contains those 60 characters will go by 61.

If your house was completely wet, then maybe.<n>Why does my house have little water in the air?<n><n>Input:My home in in winter has no heat. What is the best way to keep the temperature from staying below ____ degrees for 10 days?  Output: A radiator B: fireplace C: electric heaters D: fans<n><n>input: I have several of the same object with different features. For instance, my house (at home) has a fireplace, as well as an electric heater. In this case, which is the best?  Output: fireplace B   A fireplace is better than an electric heater, but only if you will be at home. I suggest your best plan be to purchase an electric heater in order to have at least the option of having fire-place, and possibly a furnace in the future. A fireplace is a lot of work for only little to no advantage, and might cause your electric heater to be on non-stop, making it no better than your heater, but more expensive. Your best bet would be a heater that uses gas, and you can control it from the outside.<n>The heating efficiency of electric heaters is pretty variable, so the only way to really say if you actually got a good heat-sink would be to read actual test reports, or compare with gas heaters.<n>Gas heaters are nice because they are cheap. For instance, they cost 10x more than the electric heating heaters do. Electric heaters are nice because your electric heater only costs $.05 per day, or $.50 per hour.<n>Also, be sure to check the proper electrical wiring at your house. It should be labeled properly. So if you go into the house and use the electric heaters, the correct wire would be labeled properly as well. This would eliminate the problem of the electric heaters being left open. When you are leaving, this will reduce the damage you and your house suffered.<n>The best gas heater would be an electric one. Any electric heater would do, just as long as you do not have a basement or a crawl-space underneath it. Many people use the electric heater in their basement, but only once the walls are finished, or as a last resort.

Cells have an evolutionary tendency towards an organism's growth characteristics. 3. The first cell to reproduce was the very first one to form on its own. 4. The egg was the first cell to break free of the mother cell and split. 5. All cells grow by splitting. 6. This is the easiest way to make more of a particular thing. 7. The first cell from each division has the same characteristics, whether it was the result of a fertilization or whether the cell was completely separate from the process. 8. Cells that form from the nucleus split from the cytoplasm at the exact same time as they are fertilized. 9. A cell can never divide without the help of a parent cell. 10. Most of the world's cells come from the nucleus.11. The nucleus was made to divide over and over again by its mother while she was forming the cell from it. 12. The nucleus splits, along with the cytoplasm, into two cells, one that will have a parent and another that will not. 13. The parent cell divides every time it grows, from cell one to cell eight. 14. The parental cell divides every time it reproduces, from cell one to seven. 15. Two cells split into four to make a person. 16. The nucleus divides every time it makes a copy or a new cell. 17. The parent cell divides at a rate of 12 times each year. 18. The nucleus divides every single time the cell divides. 19. A cell divides from the nucleus every once in a while. 20. A cell divides from its nucleus in the most dramatic way. 21. Humans use nuclear cells. 22. The nucleus splits, forming two cells, one of which will have the same characteristics as the other. 23. Every cell divides, every time a cell divides, into two. 24. Every cell splits into two by splitting itself apart. 25. All cells divide until they divide again. 26. All cells divide in the same way and at the same rate. 27. A cell does not divide itself in half. 28. DNA, a portion of a cell's DNA, exists within the cell.29. DNA is a genetic code.

But John still is thinking about it and replies, "What is the point at church if there are no other people?" William tells him, "$1 would get along just fine today." As they stand there with their thoughts still on the matter, they are approached by an old man who speaks to them in Latin. He asks them if they are speaking Latin and John tells him, "Yes, the Latin." William replies, "No one's speaking Latin at my church," and John just shrugs. Upon hearing the question, the man asks, "Who's your father?" William replies, "My father's dead." The man asks, "Then why are you there? You don't have any father here?" William replies, "Father? Father is dead." The old man then asks, "What did you do to him?" William replies, "I made him go away." They both walk back towards the church and William tells John, "We ought to get out of here and get a job. You'll never know how much money you'd make." John replies, "I've had enough work today." At that, he pushes William towards the gate. They walk out and then the old man leads them to John's house. They walk to the door and knock. He answers. They say the name of their uncle, Paul. The man replies, "I am not your uncle." They go in and sit down.<n>The old man stands at the table and asks, "Why don't you work here with us?" "I don't need a job," replies William and the old man starts telling him how much they were going to pay him. This continues for a while until William leaves the room and goes back to his house in the town. The old man gets up and then approaches Paul. He says, "I knew you were dead." William then tells him that he's a liar. When the old man looks at him accusingly, he says, "If I

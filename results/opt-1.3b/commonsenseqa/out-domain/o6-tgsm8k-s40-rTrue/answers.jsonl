All the babies are named William, so the first father's name is William as well. If there is two children of each mother and father in a family, how many times will that family members name be William?\noutput: It cannot be less than two because it is a full name.\nSince the first father's name would be William, William A will be twice as long as William B\nThe name William A will have length 10 + 6 = <<10*6=19>>19 William B\nWilliam A will be 9*6 = <<9*6=21>>21 William B\nThis gives William 10 + 6 = <<9*10=31>>31 Williams B\nSince William A is 9 times longer than William B, William B will be 36*18 = <<36*18=56>>56 William A\n\nInput: Every Tuesday, Bill and Mary work to get their car fixed. Every Tuesday, the bill comes in at $300 more than their bill last Tuesday. The first week the bill is $225. Every week the bill stays the same. Does the monthly increase continue? If so, how long will the bill go up every week?\noutput: If Bill works on getting the car fixed for a week, the bill will stay the same because it is a daily fixed price, not an hourly fixed cost; the bill will stay the exact same price every day and always equal $220\nBill would be paid at a daily fixed cost of $220. Every night for this week, Bill pays $220 for the car insurance.\nAt the end of the week, if Bill decided to not repair the car and just pay the $220 for insurance, the bill will stay at the exact same price because there is only 1 day in every week.\nSo Bill will pay $2250 on average in total for the year\nIn total, Bill pays $5180 on average for the year\nAnd this is a monthly fixed price not a hourly fixed price.\nSince the $220 bill is the same every day, the $220 bill will be the same every week\nSo the final answer\n\nInput: A truck's tires have 60% water in them, 100% salt, 75% sand", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

On Tuesday, every person in the music school (except Billie Jean) was allowed to purchase at least one ticket. How many tickets were sold?\nOutput: On Monday, the school students sold 8 tickets. On Tuesday, they sold 16 tickets. So Billie Jean's classmates bought 16 tickets on Monday, 16 tickets on Tuesday and 16 tickets on Wednesday.

With a timeout available, the team selects the ball with its hands and plays through the game clock only, having a shot at the championship. After the game clock is reset, with a timeout still available, the team selects only with the ball when the clock is set to its maximum time. Using a timeout will take out a large number of the players, but if it does not, there will only be 2 players left at the end. This gives them the time to score without the ball.  What percentage of the players would remain on the field if both teams played in their maximum time limit?\n\nOutput: Only 2 of the 12 players will remain on the field, since the ball now only takes up 0.5% of the field.  That leaves 10.5% of the players in the game for each team.\nSo the final score is 11-20-1x+2x*10.5*10\n\nInput:  The football team is in a close tiebreaker game with the tennis team, which has more points but less wins.

After all, we divide by 3 in most everything we do. Since 10 times 3 is 7 times 9, we get 6 times 6 = 9.\nInput: If everyone does 3 laps around the field at the end of a race, how many athletes will have broken legs by the end of the race?\nOutput: 2.5*9*3 = 5.5 athletes with broken legs\nSince this is an estimate from an estimate game, the numbers are too small to be reliable. But we might get the answer if each athlete starts with zero. In other words, every athlete will have a broken leg before the end of the race. But in reality, the number of athletes with broken legs will be greater. When they are all breaking down at the same time, the probability is that everyone has a broken leg by the end of the relay.\nInput: Let the number of races in an event be 1.

What is the probability for each of these scenarios (each with the exact same number of victories, runners, and races, but varying number of winners)?\nOutput: 2.2%\n2.2%\nSo the final answer on one day would be 2+5x5 = 14, and on the following days would be 4+3x3 = 24. So the number of races in the 4th race is 2 times the number of races in one of the other races (4+3x3=24). In other words, the 4th race is twice as likely to have winners because it has twice as many winners.

{"text": "Mediate\nThe only way to recover from exhaustion is a nap and rest.  There are 3 different amounts of naps that are possible and these will have varying effects.  Let's say that n is a natural number that represents the maximum number of hours of rest that you can get in a day.\nThe most rest that you can have in a day is x+1 = 2 and the least you can get in a night is 2/x, so 2*1/2 = 3.  The average will be 6 hours, and if you keep going back to sleep then your total sleep hours will be 4*x+2*1/2*3*x = 12 hours.  So in a day, you have 12 x = 2 * 6*1/2 * 3 * x(2*1/2) * 12 = 240 hours, roughly 3 and a half days.\nThe nap number is X^2 + 1/x=X\nThe rest number is 2/x,\nWhich means that you can get a total of 120 hours of natural, uninterrupted sleep in a day.\nHowever, during the day, you are most likely tired, and may only be able to get sleep for an hour or two at most.  Therefore there is a lot of opportunity for the need for a nap to arise in a day, and many people will have to resort to naps.\nThere is however one more way to recover from exhaustion.  You can go for a run after you sleep to get your energy levels back up.  So instead of 3.5 days, you will have 7.5 days because of the need for a nap or two.\nTherefore, over the course of 3 days you are able to recover to the normal 4 hours of sleep you were getting before your exhaustion.\nSince the nap number is X^3 + 1/x = X\nSo X is a natural number that is a multiple of 2 so the nap number is X\nSo there are 120/2 = 24 and 24/2 = 360 hours of natural sleep for a day, which means that over the course of 3 full days you can recover from fatigue completely.  However, as a rule of thumb, any amount of time that you cannot rest, no matter the length of your nap, is an unhealthy amount of time.\nThe nap number of 12/3 + 6/3 + 12 = 1440 hours\nIt therefore takes 1.4 days to get 120 hours of rest from fatigue", "answer": "B: have rest"}

He has the pencil near his nose and the paper in his hand. John draws three lines in the center of the paper. Each line has a number written on it. John can tell the numbers that go with each line by seeing how close the numbers are to each other. He should count the total number of lines (numbers in the lines) to find the smallest number that would be written on the paper's center. To do this, John can write the number 1 + n = n in the center of the line he drew. So, for example, 1 + 8 = 13. If John drew a 10, he probably would put number 10 on the paper, and 11 if he drew a 9. John can also count 1 + 9 + 8 = 44.\nOutput: Since John can see how close the numbers in each line are to each other, he can guess the center of the paper's center. This will give him the smallest number that should be written on the paper.

The hourly wage is for 5 hours.  The average hourly wage is $24.00, and a 25% wage cut results in a 23% paycut, and a 25% paycut results in a 17% paycut.  The average monthly cost of a mortgage is $350 a month.  Let's say we can pay off the monthly mortgage interest with only $150 a month out of taxes.  For a $1200 home, the mortgage payment will be $75 a month while we are living there.  After 30 years, the mortgage payment of $75 a month will have grown to $225 a month.  That's $225 x 30 = $1050 a year. And after another 20 years, the mortgage payment will have grown to $750 a year.  So in 10 years after a 20% cut, the mortgage payment of the $75 payment has grown to $160 a year.  Also, assuming equal credit, the 25% and 33% cuts would only be $110 and $87 respectively, so the remaining mortgage payment, which grows to $225 a month, grows to $200 a month after 20 years.", "answer": "E: farmer's market"}

After the first round, only 5 are asked, then the second round only 2 are asked, then 3, and so on down to zero.\nSo, for an initial count of 100 members, the second round can ask for 75 members since the team is 100.  In the second round only 10 are asked, then the third round only 10, then the fourth round only 5, then the fifth round only 5, and so on until all the members are counted.\nSo, for a initial count of 100 members the second round can ask each member 5 times, the third round can ask each member 3 times, the fourth round can ask each member 2 times, the fifth round can ask each member 1 time, and so on down until 100 are asked.\nSo, for the initial count of 100 members each member should be counted five times.\nAfter the initial count of 100, the next player can be counted three times, then the next player can be asked two times, and so on down the row until no more players are asked.\nSo on any given night, there may only be 8-10 players standing.\nSo on most nights only 8-10 players are asked in a round.\nSo the final average per person is 60 per round\nAnd the final average per person per year is: 3\nThus the total population per year is: 10\n\nInput: An egg weighs 30.00 grams and an orange does the same.

Let r be the margin of cost of $6 each item. Suppose he sells 10 items for $6.00 profit to customers A through H. What is A\u2019s profit?\nOutput: Let B be profit after subtracting cost of the items from A\u2019s profit. Then subtract 3% from r. That is, the amount of profit he earns is B + r + 3% = B+2r + 3.2%\nNow, divide 2 by 3. That is, r/3 = -3/3 = 2.2%.\nThus, r is a negative number. So he has made a profit of -2 r/3 = -2.2 r + 2 r/3 = -20.2 r.\nSo the final profit of A is ($20-$20)(40r)/2 = ($12-$20)(40r).\nB. = 2x+(20)(40)\nC. = 4 (4)(40).\nThen, B is divided by 4. That is, 4/4 = 2. Let r be the total margin of $12. The value of the total margin is 40r. Now, r/4 = -2/4 = -2. So he has made profit of $2/4 = -20 r/4 = -20.2/(2/4).\nThus, B + 2/4+ 2/4/(2/4) = B + 2 r/4 + 2 r/4 = B + 20 r/4. So, A\u2019s profit of $5 divided by the total margin of $20 divided by the total margin(40r) is $19.2. Thus, A earned $4.8 - $19.2 = ($13-$19)(40r)=8=$5.75\nD. = 2. 2*4*2*2*4*2 + 4*2*2/(2r) = 8+(2r)/4 + 2r=0 = 4. Let r", "answer": "B: city"}

If the house is never sold, it won't go to the park.\nIf the selling price of house is $3,000, the buyers will pay $3,000 + $3,000 - $3,000 = $10,000\nSince the buyers will pay $10,000 the price per house will be $10,000 x $3,000 = 50 x $10,000 = 100\nSo the final answer for $10,000 is $100\n\nInput: A couple of fire engines were stranded during a flood, where should they be towed to?

How many peanuts would someone have to eat to get enough to replace the lost 25 lbs of fat?\nOutput:The volume of the box is 125%. So the lost 25 kg's of fat needs to be replaced by 45 kg's of popcorn. Therefore, if person x eats 10 boxes of popcorn, and person y eats 15 boxes, person x needs to eat 45 x 30 = 540 kg's worth of popcorn.  This is a loss of 0.5 kg's of fat. Since person x is overweight, and had 25 kg's of fat, and person y is normal, then if person y ate 10 boxes of popcorn, then person y has a loss of 5 kg's of fat. Therefore, if someone eats 10 boxes of popcorn and 10 boxes of carrots, then they need to eat 15 boxes of popcorn, which is 50 kg's worth of popcorn, or about the same amount as person x. Therefore, if someone has lost 25 kg's of weight and has only gained 85 kg's of weight, then they have gained 10.5 kg's of fatty tissue compared to their weight. So to replace the 25.5 kg's of saturated fat, person y would need to eat 15 of their normal quantity of popcorn, or about 2 bags of popcorn for this individual.\n\nInput: The following questions:\nSupposing an elephant has a total of 50 kgs of fat.\nIn which direction is the trunk?\nIn which direction is its tail?\nSuppose the elephant only has 2 legs.

The distance between two air bubbles increased, the bubble's weight increased, the air bubble's volume increased, but its volume decreased. If an air bubble is now 100 feet (30 m) high, how many air bubbles is it?\nOutput: If a person was 30 feet away, the distance between their head and their neck would be 100 ft (30 m). If the person is now 100 yards (90 m) away, the distance between two air bubbles at its height would be 100 ft (1 m). Then there is a distance that you cannot get to, and a bubble that is in another place.\nSo the final distance is 100 + 100*30*90*100 = 100 ft\n\nInput: This summer you bought 1 bushel corn for $12.00, and another bushel corn for $6.00.

{"text": "No one was hurt, but at least 50 feet was stopped\n60 feet of traffic was slowed, but no one was injured\n30+30+30 = 120 feet of stopped traffic\n20+20+20 = 120 feet of traffic that took less than five minutes to clear\nSo the final answer was 20\n\nInput: The police department wanted to make sure that the scene of the accident was safe.  The chief of police said:\n\"When I ask you to speed, I\u2019m asking you to move at a normal rate of speed, whether you need to turn right or go straight on.  When I tell you to slow down, that\u2019s slower than your usual rate of speed. \"\nOutput:\nA normal distance from a stop sign to stop is approximately 5 mph. With 3 cars stopped the distance reduced to 2.5. This equals a time of 2.2 seconds to stop the car, or about 11 seconds (with the speed of your car).\nA full stop does not equal a normal distance from a stop to stop. This takes two vehicles. So a full speed take 1.25 seconds. This equals a time difference of 30 seconds or 7 feet.\nSo a 9-foot wide road would have to be slowed by 35 feet in a real situation\n10 feet (10+35) - 5 feet = 1 foot = 8 feet\nSo 1 foot of 10 is equal to 4.5 feet of 8 (11). Thus the final answer is 1\n\nThe information above is about the number of cases of diphtheria reported in your country, but there is a lot of other data you can obtain in statistics software which would be more informative than this question.\nThese may include:\nYour country\u2019s infant mortality rate (in babies per 100,000 births),\nThe total birth rate,\nChild poverty (the number of children who have no parents)\nThe number of people on disability benefits, and\nThe number of children who are sick or who died.\nSome of these would be very useful for finding your own causes for infant mortality or poverty, but for a more in-depth analysis of the various causes of mortality and disability in the United States you may prefer to consult the books and articles by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Social Security Administration, and the American Association of Public Health.

If a child gives their bath four times in a week, what do you think will happen to the child: (1) they have more problems washing, (2) they will make poor decisions, or (3) they won't get dressed?\nOutput:\nSince the child gives a maximum of 4 baths per week, this means the bath will not keep the child's bathroom clean from May to December.\nSo the final result is 4 baths for the week after May. It is not clean enough.\nSo the final average result is 4 baths per week, with 3 baths.\nSo the average daily result is 4 baths, with 2 baths.\nSo the final daily result is 4 baths 4 times a week, with 4 baths.\n\nInput: The doctor gave each child a check for $1,000 on May 3.

How many weekends will Jane work?\nInput:  10 x 2 x 2x (16 x 4) = 64.  12. = < 10\noutput: 6. = 8\nSo 12 would be incorrect\n\nInput: If an iceberg has 40 centimeters on top and is only a quarter of the width of the car, how long is the iceberg when it is the size of the car?\nOutput: Suppose there is an iceberg with a quarter of its original thickness and 20 centimeters on its top. How wide would it be?\nOutput: If there is a 3cm thick iceberg the width is 4 cm. With a 4 cm thickness the width is 8 cm. When the iceberg is 3 meters wide you cannot use the width as a measure. If there has to be a length, you would be looking at thickness, not width. If it's thinner than 3 centimeters it would take 8 cm to cross the ice.\nOutput: If the iceberg's thickness equals 16 meters and the width is 16 meters, the iceberg would be 20 meters long.\nIf the iceberg's thickness is 2 meters and the width is 2 meters, the iceberg would exceed 25 meters in volume. The iceberg would weigh 25 kilograms (half a ton).\nIf the iceberg's width equals 1.5 meters and the thickness is 1.5 meters, the iceberg would fill 2.5 cubic meters of space. The iceberg would weigh 2 kilograms (20 tons).\nIf the iceberg is half the width of the car and 3 meters thick, it would be 9.1 meters across and 26 meters long. The iceberg would weigh 1 ton. Because of its thickness, this iceberg would need a width of 32 meters across to fit all four tires. By the way, the car would probably not fit inside a 5 meter parking space.\nOutput: If (2) 10x2 = 16x2 = 24.5 cm the car's width (3) = 16x2 + 16=32.5. So the iceberg's thickness (2) = 16*3=32.5. By the way, this will take about 18 hours to cross the ice. If there is a car, it would take about 2.5", "answer": "C: car trunk"}

In reality, we know where Bob's going and why, for that is what makes it a man.  And, it is only natural to look at things in terms of the context of your experience.  If Bob left the room because he wanted to see a woman, well he went and saw a woman.  If he stayed because it was nice to see her again, that would be a man making an exit if he wanted to have sex.  If he went and didn't have sex because he wanted to show her he still had a manliness, he was probably in the mood to have sex.  So the way to know how manly, in your own mind, Bob is is to use that context instead of a one-dimensional image.\nThe problem with Bob leaving the room, then, is when is he returning or did he leave and not return?\nAnd, that's the reason they didn't hear his exit.  When bob is away or away from a woman at least once a year for at least 5 minutes, he is a man.  When he leaves for an extended time, that number changes.

In addition to her salary, she is expected to make dinner on Sunday.  For a week, she makes $300. In addition to two days of shopping groceries, she must have some left over money for a treat on Monday for her kids.  She also has to prepare a homemade salad during Monday evening so she hasn't wasted any money in the past week.  How much extra cash did she have?\nOutput: $500.02\nSo in addition to making $400 a week, she is expected to prepare another $50 worth of food.\nAfter making $500.02 for the week, she must prepare a special treat, which requires $100 more.  After that, she must prepare $50 worth of food so she won't have a surplus of food.  After that, one item is her weekly allowance plus $50 in cash.  At the end of the week, her $300 in grocery money doesn't go very far.  She also must make the salad and buy the groceries and prepare the special treat so her food budget actually covers the amount she has taken out at the beginning and ends of the week.  This gives her an extra $100 in her paycheck.  Now $100 for groceries is left as her only expense to cover for the week.  So she is still expected to make more than twice as many meals this week. So at the end of the week $400 is still her average amount she makes per week.\nBecause of her food budget, she doesn't have much left at the end of the first week to pay her bills. On Monday, she has to take her $100 from grocery to utilities to pay her $400-a", "answer": "B: passing grade"}

The bookstore could buy 5 books that sell for $10, 4 books that sell for $5, 4 books that sell 1 book each, and a couple of books that sell for $1 each.\nOutput: In the bookstore, the carpeted and magazine sold books represent 5 * 5 x 10 = 15 * 15 x 10 = 40 * 40 = 160 books. Since the floor of the bookstore is 30 x 30 feet, it leaves a 40 square foot area that can be filled with books.\nSince the books sell for $1 each, this means the bookstore sells 80 * 80 = 3200 books.\nSo the bookstore sells 320 books per hour in a store that sells 8-10 books per hour.\nSince there are 320 * 8-10 = 320 books per hour, this leaves 2.8 x 8-10 = 160 hours per day for books.\nSo the book buyer spends 240 hours per week in the bookstore.\nSo the bookstore can sell 160 books per week.\n\ninput: what percentage do you prefer between 25% and 85% profit made at a restaurant business?\noutput: do you prefer to work for 25% profit or 85% profit?\nInput: There are four restaurants in your city\nOutput: 1+4 is 8\nThe above answer has 2/3 of a probability of 2.3, so the above answer is 2/3 of a 5/3 probability of 2.75.\nThis indicates that the answer of \u201cdo you prefer to work for 10% profit with 20% profit margin or do you prefer to work the business with 15% profit margin with 25% profit margin\u201d has a probability of 2.75\nSo the final answer of \u201cDo your best.

A was hit in the face by a baseball and lost 5 teeth. While going to the dentist today, A lost an upper tooth. A had to go to the store and get another one so she only had 2 teeth left.  She got home and ate more than her fillings could hold, and had to finish her fillings with sugar and jelly so they would not lose their enamel.  A has 6 teeth now, one of which is badly damaged.  She asked her parents how much money her teeth would cost her at the dentist.  Her parents told her that at the local hardware store, there are places they will put in new teeth that cost nothing.  She chose one of these locations.  While walking out of the store, A realized she forgot the rest of her food.

Total = 3*6*1 = 12 servings.\nThe total number of servings divided by 6 equals 1.52 servings/family\nThe total number of 1/2 servings divided by 1.52 serves/servings equals 3 servings in this dish\nSince this is double the amount of food needed for family, it means they would serve 2.52 servings in total for family.\nIn addition to serving family, they would serve 1 cup of wine for themselves in total.\nTherefore, they could give out 2 cups of wine\nIf 3 servings were given per person, that would raise a total of 3 servings\nWhich cup means they divide the portion of food they gave out by three servings per person\nFor example, 1 cup of wine is equal to 1.5 servings which is divided by 3 servings.\nTherefore, they provide 1.5 servings for family, then give out 2 servings in total plus 6.7 servings total for family.\nTotal servings divided by 6 = 20.\nSo total servings = 20 divided by 6 = 20\n\nInput:  How many people in the USA died from starvation in 2000?\n Output:  How many people died in 2000 from starvation?\nThe number in 2000 is in the following table:  0.153855\nSupportive Foodstuffs:  Per Capita:  Per Person:\n\nInput:  What is the length of an hour?\nOutput: What is the length of a day?

So if you put a 100 pound thing in the light side of the scale, it only adds something to the heavy side, meaning that you actually gain no weight on your \"light side\" of this scale. So subtract 110 from 10, making it 3x the amount of \"heavy side.\"\nOutput: 3x + 110 = 1x + 110 = x\nSo the final answer was 1/4.\n\nInput: There are two dogs on a road who are very close together.

Some thieves steal some of the cars. The owners of the cars then decide to put their cars in a garage. How fast are cars when stolen?\nOutput: If a car is stolen at 3am in the morning, and the car is moved to a garage the following evening it is 3 minutes at 40 miles per hour.\nIf the car is stolen on Tuesday, November 11, the thief moves 3 minutes and 40 seconds at the speed of 40 miles per hour. The car moves at 5mph.\nSo if stealing a car takes 3 minutes 40 seconds at 40 miles per hour, then the car would go 5 mph on the street.\nIt's 2 hours 2 minutes 40 seconds at the speed if 40 miles per hour. So the car would move at the rate of 5mph on the street.\nFrom what you can see from the math above, in theory, it's 6 minutes and 3 seconds at 40mph. But it takes 5mph plus 6min to move the car. The car reaches its speed of 5mph in the span of 3 hours. So in theory it would only make it into the next city over.

For each plane, 10,000 tickets cost $5,000 each round trip. Suppose the airline has to pay $30,000 a year for each of these seats. The airline can generate $30,000,000 in revenue and a profit of $200,000. If you were to start taking the money from the flights and investing it in an interest-bearing account, how much income would you receive during that 3-year period?\nOutput: For each of the five 747s $5,000 = $3,000 * 300 = $15,000.\nTotal from all the 747s during that 3-year time period: $15,000,000 x 300.\nThat means the total net revenue and the total net profit for the airline increased $500,000 for the three-year period\nSince the airline gets paid annually, there would be enough money left over to invest in the airplanes until the net interest income generated surpassed the interest on the cash they were using to invest.\nSo how much money would you receive from the airline?\nSo the final answer = $200\n\nOutput:In an effort to stop a burglar from breaking into a home, a guard in a tower has a gun.

Then I think that you are too boring to play chess, and then I have no idea what else you can do on television.\nIn any case, I think that chess is pretty boring.  I like to play games when I am bored; I like to play strategy games; I like to game the board.  I guess that's the point of the game.  I can find my own strategy, and I can play until I win or until I lose.  The only other game that is quite comparable to chess, in my mind, is Monopoly.  Although I'd probably say that you need a much more strategic mind to successfully try to beat me with Monopoly than you do with chess, I think most people would still rather play chess then Monopoly.\nSince I am bored with chess, all I want to do is read or watch television.  So all the choices I am making are, \"Why should I not play chess?\"  There is really no other answer to my question.

Once his mother saw him struggling in his French class, she changed his lessons to one speaking just one language. What he should have done was move. What he did instead is to stay in his new class where he was better than average. What happened to him is that the children did not know what to do with him.

{"text": "A: secular  B: short term C: crowd D: eternal\nAt weddings there are always at least 5 weddings at the same time on different days. Therefore weddings are secular.  At a wedding, the guests are unpredictable. At other times the guests are predictable.  At many secular events there is a ceremony that people attend that are not part of the immediate party attending the religious event.\nSo secular wedding parties have 5 attendees at the same time on multiple days.

The church at the wedding, has the guests present, but there is no religious ceremony or religious party involved.  The Church at the wedding is secular, but does not hold a secular wedding party.  The only difference is that the Church is not held in a venue with a religious feel (i.e., the Church is not at the venue of the secular party).

There is about 60 liters of air inside. If you pour 10 liters of air into it, how much air is left inside the can? Also, what is the maximum pressure you can hold it at?\nOutput: x/60 = 60 x 10^8 liters = 8 x 10^1 = 100x20 = 10200 liters\nSo, we can say that the pressure on top of the can is 100x20 = 10^20\nx is x^2 x = 10^2\nSo, we can determine that 5.3 liters of air in the can = 5.3 liters out of the can\nWe can only assume that because we bought the air and opened the can, that 10 liters of air were in the can, so 2.5 liters of air were removed before we opened the can. Therefore, we can only put 10*10 liters of air in and then close the can, or 8 * 10 liters of air, or 3 liters of air.\n\nInput: The teacher, after a good morning's sleep, says to his students, \"I think we had a good day yesterday.

She must decide how much of their wardrobe must be thrown out and what must be carried into the new closet.  She chooses to throw out 50% of everything.  Each closet contains  5 or 6 closets. If a closet contains 2 cabinets, how many boxes must be removed to carry the shoes?\nThe teacher decides to remove 50% of 2 cabinets.\n5 boxes must be removed for each closet\nEach closet has 5 or 6 closets\nIn the new closet there are 10 boxes because each closet has 2 cabinet.\nSo the total for the 2 cabinets is 4.\n5+5*4==6\nThis is 10+6. If the total number of boxes is 5, then 2 boxes must be removed from each cabinet. If the total number is 6, then 4 boxes must be removed from the cabinets.\nTherefore this is 10+5*4=12 with a total of 12 cabinets.\nThis result is correct. The teacher chose to remove 50% of everything and carried the rest into the new closet. Therefore, the teacher must choose  100% of the shoes must be thrown out.

{"text": "A: illiterate\nChoose D instead of B.\n\nInput: A man is driving to the doctor's office and he crashes into some other cars. He has $2000 worth of damage. What can he do to get the police to take his insurance money, and how long will it take?\nOutput: If he has $2000, the car only has $500 value that is not covered by his insurance. The car is worth $5000. So he can claim $10,000 of the total $500 value. If the police do not accept his claim, they could still write him up for $1000 though. If he has $2000 worth of insurance on both vehicles, the total damage will be less than $1000. The total is estimated between $3000 and $5000. The estimated time from his wreck till the police arrive is 5 minutes, but the estimated time to get his insurance money is also 5 minutes. So he will lose more time than he would have gotten by filing an insurance claim. So he will lose $500 through his insurance money, $500 through his money through paying at the police station, and $500 through the money he will lose by getting his insurance back. So he loses $2000 in the total.\n\nInput: What is a person who is educated? Choices: A: illiterate B. Knowledgable C. Own house D. Have enough food E. meet expectations\nOutput:  A.

He was too young for a cavity, which means that the dentist does not need to perform a root canal treatment. What do you think the dentist did?\nOutput: The dentist prescribed a low dose of pain medicine for his pain. If he continued to use the medicine, the dentist would have to pull out the tooth and perform an implant procedure. It would require a large amount of anesthesia to stop the pain. The pain would then return shortly after the implant was in place. If he used the medicine long enough it would actually damage the tooth instead of just numb it. If he stopped using the medicine, the pain would gradually go away. So the answer is B\n\nInput: What do you think a person who is well qualified? should tell your teacher about their day?\nOutput: The well qualified person should talk about something you", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}
{"text": "The only train stations in the area are at the cathedral, station, and fairgrounds.  The metro station is not very convenient, and is easily accessible only by train.  The fairgrounds and cathedral are the only good ticket booths in the area.\nOutput: The ticket booth at the cathedral at 10:30 am is $30.  The ticket booth at 10:30 am in Station B costs $30 also, while the ticket booth at 10:32 am in Station C costs $25.  The ticket booth in Metro Station D is not convenient, and is almost unusable.  The 10:32 am ticket booth in Station E is not convenient at all, and only takes 5-10 minutes.  By 2:30 pm a ticket might have been sold, and the price would be $25+4x5+5x.  The 10:30 am to 2:30 pm fare is $4 + 5*5*5*5*.  This will cost the fare user $12 plus $4.\n\nInput: Where do you buy tickets at the bus stop in a suburb for a car on a Saturday? Choices: C: mall D: railway station A: station B: train station C: station D: shopping mall E: shopping center\nOutput: The best option is to purchase tickets at a mall or railway station.  The bus system's bus station offers better options for ticket-buying; the 10:30 am to 8:05 pm commuter bus fare should cost $21, and parking is free during rush hours.\nThe 10:30 am to 9:05 pm fare is even cheaper, and parking is free on weekends.\nA bus station or train station has a very limited number of trains per day, and most trains are short.  The 10:40 am and 10:50 am to 9:05 am train times are nearly impossible to get, since few people get off the metro at 10:30 am or 2:30 pm; they may get on a later train, but might not get off until 11:00 am or 3:00 pm.  This leaves 5 to 10 minutes of time before the 8:05 pm train would arrive.  The 7:05 pm train is best, since there has never been a problem getting to this station on that train.

If Congress does not pass the deficit reduction legislation in time, Obama proposes to ask other countries to increase taxes on people earning more than $1 million each year:  (1) $200 for every person earning more than $1.2 million; (2) $500 for everybody earning more than $1million.

What would the amounts be? Output: Yes if each person has a right to the same wage, but that is highly unlikely, because wages are fixed. So each person can sue the person who has rights to the same wage and receive the wages he or she is worth.  In fact there could be such a lawsuit, because wages depend on productivity.

Output: How many people live in the house on the top floor?\nOutput: On the top floor, 42 = <<42-1/2=<<2x+1+5=10>>10 people.\nSo the final number is 42 + 1/2 = <<42x+1/2=<<4x+12x+6+1+2x+<<8>>12 people.\nSo the total for the top floor is 42 + 2.\nSince 18 people (4 x 2 + 5 x 3) = 12, the total number of people is 12 * 8 = 42\nSo the house has 42 people on the first floor and 42 people on the top floor.\nSo the total house population is 20.\nSo the final house population is 20 x 3 = 40.\nSo the final population is 40 x 12* 12 = 8.\nSo the total population on the first floor is 8 x 5 = 8.\nSo all of the houses on the first floor must have 12 people.\nSo 8/5 is 50 so the final house population is 8/5 * 10 = 8\nSo all of the people on the first floor must be 8 x 5.\nSo the total first floor population is 4/5 = 4.\nSo the total 2nd floor population is 2/5 = 2\nSo the total 3rd floor population is 0\nSo the total 4th floor population is 0\nThe final population is 1.\nSo the total number of visitors to the house is 1.\nOutput: So the people in the house are 8\nSince each room has 4 people in it, and each person lives in one of the rooms, this means\n80 x 0 = 60\n8 x 20 = 60 x 2 = 120\nSo the number of people in the house is 80\nSo 40 / 2 = 120 = 80 total\nSo the number of rooms in the house = 80(120 * 2 = 1200)\nSo the house must have 120 people.\nSince every room has 4 people", "answer": "A: school"}

What do you suggest the landlord should charge the employee?\nOutput: Suppose the employee is supposed to be paying this extra $200 for every tenant.\nLet's say the landlord charges the employee $400 for the extra job.\nThe additional $200 the employee is paying the landlord to fix the leak is $400 / 10 = $100.  This $100 is divided among each tenant.  By dividing this money among the tenants to have them pay him as he fixes the leak, he has more money to pay the tenants to have him fix the leak.  Therefore, paying the employee as he fixes the leak will net the employee $200.  $200 - $400 = $30.  Therefore, since the employee will have even more money now than when the previous leak was fixed, the employee has to be paid an extra $30 to get the job done.  Therefore, the employee's extra $200 is divided by $30 = $0.  Therefore, since there is $30 more, the employee now has a net salary of $300.  This $30 net salary is then divided by $300 = $10.\nTherefore, since the employee needs to", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

So he went out to the corner of his backyard, and the corner came to an abrupt end. He opened his window, and the wind kicked up a great cloud of smoke. He began running toward the smoke, but felt a sensation that he should not take a shortcut, so he turned around and began walking back toward the other three candles. He ran for a block, and finally made it back to the middle of the room. Then the housekeeper brought him a candle to light, so he lit the candle and walked back toward the other three. The fourth candle was beginning to burn out too, so he lit it and went back to the opposite corner. He began walking and came to a fork in the path. He picked which way he wanted to go, and went up the fork. When he neared the top of the fork, he felt a pain in his ankle. He tried to walk backward and fall, but a tree branch snapped and dragged him back down, and he landed hard in the grass. He began to panic, because every step was a new injury.

So computers often create problems (or at least find their way out of a problem) in the form of a number between 0 and a certain value.  So computers know how to get from the 0 to any value.  This is often used as a measure of how smart computer are.  A computer that can solve all problems would be smarter than any human, especially if it has a way of learning and adapting.  For instance, some computers have a way of learning what new problems are, even in the face of large challenges.  So in many cases, computers use an algorithm in which computers do the hard work for humans in situations like the one above.  Computers have also built and understand problems based on the problem that is the output.  Computers must solve these problems in order to get the actual results.  Examples of this include problems that deal with the physical properties of elements of nature (e.g. chemical, thermodynamic and physical physics).

The total amount (before tax) that the patient pays is $15, but the patient gets $5.80 of that: $7.80 is saved.\nIf there's another dentists in town, they'll get the $15 for a different price and give him $5.00 instead.\nThe real question is whether there's a dentist in your town that will take a different price for the same procedure.\nOf course, there are people who simply prefer not to have a dentist at all.\nThere are also plenty of people who just like to watch movies. Some people think watching movies is cheaper than having a dentist's assistant administer the paste, and some people pay more for their Dental Paste but like to watch movies.\n\nInput:The question is \"Can you make a new man out of a woman from a bottle of baby oil?\"\nOutput: You cannot make a new woman out of a baby oil.\nA baby oil-filled bottle equals one man, but you can't make one from a bottle.", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

Where is the greatest volume of students during those 3 days?\nOutput: In the first day, there are 1 in 10 classes, on the second days there are 1 in 50 classes, and on the third days there are 1 in 100 classes.\nEach day there are between 1 and 1.5 times as many people teaching, as there are people attending.\nSince the number of students are the greatest on the 3rd day, the total student load is 50*1.5 = <<50*1.5=150>>150 students each week\nSo the final answer has 150 + 1/2 * 1.5 = <<150*1.7=190>>190 students each week\nSo each week 1.57 times as many people are teaching, as 1.14 times as many are attending.\n\nInput: There are three groups of 50 people each in a classroom, and each group includes seven people.  What is the total class space of those 50 people?\nOutput: There are 50*7=<<50*7=210>>210 seats in the classroom.\nSince there will be a little more free space than there will be chairs, the total total number of people that are in the classroom will be more than 210, because they will also have to be seated.\nSo only 210 of the 534 seats per week are occupied each week by the people who are seated in the class\nSo the final answer of the class size is 420\n\nInput: One of the boys in school (not the same one as the little boy who had to learn to talk) came home from work after a really hard day on Tuesday having a headache and not being \"the same boy as yesterday,\" so his mother decided to make up a story that the headmaster had come and taken him to the doctor to make sure there really was no brain tumor, but he had been diagnosed with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) just in case.

She will use 10 pounds of butter and 6 gallons of syrup.  She will weigh both products and calculate how many slices she will need to bake for 120 people. At midday, she will weigh the product for comparison.  She will take her calculator and calculate the total product using a formula: 10 grams of butter, 6 grams of syrup = 1 pound of cake. Let 10g of the cake be the weight of the butter and 6g of syrup, and multiply by 120 people, so 120*2g=960 pounds of cake,  and multiply the resulting number by 120 calories,  so 960*120=1220 calories.\n\noutput: A = 1200x320 x 1220\nC = 960-1220=160\nD = 960-120=32\nE = 960-120=0\nFor any number higher than 8, the total is 1. If E is 100, the total is 1, for any number lower than 0 it is 0. This is why a is 2 and b is 1.\n\nOutput: Every year the number of cows that milk at any given time in the year is the same.  If c is the number of farms in the county where cows are used to make milk, how many times c increases each year?\nOutput: If 1 and 2 are the same length year after year after year, then the number of farms must increase exactly 1x every year. We can see that by multiplying 2 by 5. Thus 2 * 10 = 60 is the number of farms larger than 0 that have cows milk every year.\nIf c is the number of cows in each farm that milk every year, then the number grows by c * 100 = 60 every year. So the total size of the farm each year grows by c * 100, with 1 in 100 of that increasing the number by 1.\n\nInput: Alice has 100 children.

The barber takes John's height and weight and trim it into a shape he likes. The barber then places the chin strap of the hat John wants on top of John's head. The barber then puts the chin strap of the fedora John wants on top of the fedora the barber's assistant put on the barber's head. As he gets ready to leave the barber's shop, John notices something: his chin strap is very tight. So he decides that he wants to take it off. As he runs off, he notices his fedora isn't as tight as it should be. As he runs off the barber shop, he notices that his chin strap isn't as tight as necessary. He then calls the barber, who is now standing next to him as they run off.\nThe barber's assistant is standing next to John when they run off the barber shop.

He charges $200 for week-long rent. There is a $35 deposit at the front desk. He receives $100 from each tenant who leases a week. The average number of weeks in a season is 60.  What percentage of the 60 tenants will lease a month and pay the $75 rental fee?\nOutput: x - 30 = <<50>\nThat's about half of the 55% that will not pay the $75 fee.  The remaining 45% will pay the $75 fee despite the risk of losing $40 to $45 when their month is over.\nWhich represents a reduction of the $75 from 60 to 45.\nSo the final number after all 60 tenants must pay the $75 fee is 45 * 35 = 35 * 55 = 45*55\nSo the final answer to the question >>x= <<50>> x = <<100>> x = <<100>\nthat's 15 * 55 = 35 * 60 + 15 * 55 = 35*55\nFor a total of 15*60 = 35 * 55\nAnd for a total of 7*55 = 85\nthat's 90 x 105\nSo the final answer: 85\n\nInput: A man drives his pick up truck a half mile to the next shopping center.

How many rocks will the children throw?  Also, the first one will throw out of the time frame. How many times will that happen?\nOutput: 2 out of 2 kids (x=2x + 1) throw rocks = [(2x+1)/2)/6\n2 out of two kids = [(2x+2)/2)= (2x+(2x+1)/8)*4*1/5\n2 out of two = [(2x+3)/2]= (-2y2/3x2) + (-1y2/3x3)\nThus, if 2 out of 2 throws the rock, the child gets all 6 rocks.\nSo let's look at the answer: [(2x+1)+2x+(2x+(2x/4))+(2x+1)]. This gives 0*0 = 0y(2x-1) + 0(1y - 1) = 1y\nTherefore, we get 1*0 = 3y, thus giving us 1/6 = 3yy.

When he is hungry, he often leaves his apartment for lunch instead of cooking. For the last 10 months, he eats the same sandwich every time he is hungry.  Every time he goes out to eat, he purchases lunch from a nearby restaurant.  Does this account for 10% of his meals?\nOutput: The percentage of the meals eaten is proportional to the number of times a meal has been eaten over the last 10 months.\nThe 100 meals eaten over the last 10 moths was $6.  The 100 times a meal has been cooked and consumed over the last 10 months is $15\n$6 x 100 = $60\nSo 10% of 100 = $20\nSince the final answer was $20, he used 60% of his food budget to buy lunch every month\nBecause the final answer was $60, he used 40% of his food budget for food every month\nSo the 10% of meals eaten accounts for 40% of his meals\nSo the 10% meals eaten contributed 10% to his $60 food budget\nSo for the 10% meals eaten 10% contributed to his food budget", "answer": "C: drug store"}

Of those 150 stars, 40% are brighter than a supernova because they have a large white dwarf star inside them.  If the total light output from those 40% stars were converted to a full sized solar system, they would be 1.8 light-years in size. If the stars all had the same ratio of star to light, the sun would still be about 1 light-years away in it's orbit.  So how long would it be before the sun could actually be closer than 1 light-year to the earth?\nInput: Suppose a human flew the earth's atmosphere to the farthest point from any star in the sky, and took a picture with a camera. How long would it take for someone on the ground, on Earth's surface, to be able to see the pictures from that far away?\nOutput: If that camera was on an aircraft, it could take 2.5 seconds if the camera was at 50,000 ft and the people on the ground were standing a mile away. If that camera was at 100,000 ft, the people on the ground would probably be able to see the picture on the other side of the earth at 35 miles high. Because it was being carried in an aircraft, it might take 3,000 seconds to take the picture back on the other side of our planet.\nOutput: Taking the camera's weight and dividing by 2,500/2,500 = <<10*X=10>>35\nSo the final answer may be 35\n\nInput:There are 5 different types of water bottles.

How much snow can cover an acre of land?\nOutput: 10 acres of pure white equals a total of about 300 pounds of snow.\nThe total snow amount must be 300 pounds of snow.  Hence the total area must be >1 acre.  In this case, the total snow amount is 300 pounds=<<300*1*3=1500>>1500 pounds\nA total of 1500 pounds of snow covers the total area of the area covered by the snow that has occurred from 10 am to 1 pm today.\nTo get the total area, divide the total snow amount by 1000.

The size of her tumor is the same every day, so she never sees it.  Thus, the x-ray machine takes 3 hours to scan the whole body.  The tumor grows to the size that it does every day, so when the doctor looks at the tumor the doctor sees another 2cm.  The tumor then stretches to 8cm.  In real time, the patient's tumor will shrink to 4cm since there is no x-ray each time the doctor sees the tumor.  However, an x-ray each week may be needed since the tumor grows from day to day.

Finally, buying treats from a post office eliminates buying toys, coloring books, and other items that are needed for the class in question.\n\nInputs: This game is played on the board consisting of 60 red, 30 green and 30 blue squares. The objective of the objective of the game is to find the number of items within the 60 squares. This is usually given as points. The more points in the game, the higher the score achieved by player A, the higher scoring each individual player is, the more scoring each team is able to reach. To do this, individual players will pick one number within the 60 squares, they then choose 3 numbers within the red squares, they then choose what number they are picking from the blue squares. Everytime they make a pick, a new number (or the same number or lower level in the red squares from the last time they picked a number) can be selected, so it is necessary to select multiple numbers before making a pick because each pick only selects one number. The player in the front and the back of a queue will get priority in choosing which numbers are available, and can start choosing numbers when the rest of the player's are still picking numbers (like in other games). In this game, everyone gets 3 points for each item they choose and 1 point for picking any multiple of 3 numbers (within their own color). It is then up to the player who was next in the line at the start of the game to choose from the 3 options presented on the left of him/her and on the right to choose what number they were picking from the blue squares, and then to go turn around and make the next pick. Everyone in the line will have to try to pick the same numbers, with very few exceptions like with some color and/or number matching games, but any time you have only the first few choice, any player can choose the same, and the next player can choose the same. Whoever has the most points at the end of each turn will win this game. At the end of each turn, player B will receive 10 points, player A will receive 5 points and player C will receive 3 points.\nThis is a really fun game", "answer": "A: candy store"}

It's been determined that most diseases are caused by the bacteria MERS virus which spreads through the bloodstream of people who are infected through contact with body fluids such as blood, semen, and sweat. Human contact can transmit the virus and can be passed from person-to-person before the body can recognize that it has been infected. Human blood and body fluids are especially vulnerable to this kind of virus. Human blood contains a lot of dead germs, in particular HIV-infected germs. People can become infected with MERS virus when they have a fever, persistent cough, persistent loss of appetite, or sudden weight loss. Human sweat contains some germs, which can get into the body through the nose and get into the bloodstream.\n\nInput: You must count the hours that the sun shines on the beach and the time each hour will go until a cloud covers the beach.

Hence the total number of dogs is 5 / 1 = 7 dogs.\nSince dogs are the third number of any number of dogs the total dog number is 5/1 = 4 dogs\nThe total number of all dogs is 7 dogs/1 = 41 dogs\nThus the total number of humans is one human which we now know is 21 humans / 1 = 15 humans.\nTotal number of all humans = 20 humans/1 = 51 humans\nIn other words humans are the last number of any number of humans/1 = 50 humans.\n\nInput: When three people are playing Monopoly, who wins?

Which material must the sand be to keep it from melting?\nOutput: Sand cannot melt, only water. Water must have the same temperature across its range. So there are 2 different elements, one ice and one sand, which must be mixed to make the ice and sand.\n\nTo prevent one sand from melting, it must have the same temperature as the air temperature. Sand cannot have too little water (below freezing) nor it can have too much (above freezing) water. Sand cannot be too hot. An overabundance of sand (dense) can make for an overabundance of melting (cold) air. So the sand temperature must be equal to the surface tension of the water at whatever temperature it is at.\nBecause water is so warm, sand must be of the same temperature. Therefore, sand should be water-infused (ice). It should be soft, like a rubber blanket. Sand should also be resistant to sunlight (heat). Sand should never be hard. It should be able to be picked up with the fingers and carried about (towels). Sand should also not be brittle. It's important to have no cracks in the sand which prevent the sand from melting. For example, if water freezes at a temperature of -4 degrees Celsius, then sand should be free of cracks (crystal structure) at a temperature of 5 degrees Celsius, since crystal structure has yet to occur. So to prevent sand from melting, the sand must be frozen to ice, not soft. So sand can not be too hard. It should be soft and easily rolled up (pillow). Sand should also never crack, since it is made of water. Sand should also not be too cold (tug). Sand should also not have too much water (liquid.) Sand should also never be a little (dry). All of this causes sand to either be too soft or too rigid (dense). Sand should either be a perfect circle or a perfect square. Sand", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

If he had a son, he would have two children, \"A1\" and \"A2\".  Each day after the same time a month a leader called \"Leader B\" would go to the children and tell them some secret and tell them they will be a great leader, etc.  As time passed, the leader A would have more and more kids, and eventually all the children would be gone.  However, Leader B is still alive because he has a sister named \"Shelia\" and a brother named \"Tyrus\".  If the children are no longer alive, then a leader called \"Leader D\" decides to make some \"secret\" rules for the children that the children know.  First rule is that they must be able to think fast enough to figure out how to get out of a situation they don't want anymore.  If they cannot get out of the situation, they must keep moving forward.  If they start to slow down, the leader says something that will make them move faster.  When the rules came into effect the people left the group, no one could figure out how to get \"A1\" and not have him go away, \"A2\" never stopped moving and still was stuck, and no one knew how to get \"Shelia\" out of \"A1\".  Finally, a new leader named \"Leader C\" decides to start his own group, now it is called \"The Group of Four\".  Finally, whenever \"Shelia\" or \"Tyrus\" decides or is told something that they think is wrong, they must do the opposite of what they were told.  Finally, \"Shelia\" has a nephew named \"Xyl\" that \"Tyrus\" tells her that he will never be able to love and that her brother will always be with another woman.  Finally, if the children of \"Tyrus\" move on to the next leader, \"Leader D\" will tell the children something about \"A1\" that \"Shelia\" will not be able to figure out.\n\nInput:The temperature is 28 degrees with clear, sunny skies.

{"text": "Choices A, B, and C are correct\nSo the final answer was A\n\nInput:Two identical sets of eggs must be cracked to get a shell. What is the number you must crack one egg on the first try?\nOutput: Each crack must be no wider than 0.5 inches.\nThat means if you crack an egg once and another one in just as quick, you cannot get the shell on each one.\nSince there are 2 sets of eggs here, the correct answer here is (2-sqrt((x-1)=0))/2 which means that you can crack one egg on the last try.\nSince (2-sqrt(x-1)=0) = 1, 0 is exactly as soon as 0, 0.5*sqrt(x-0.5)=4, where 4 is the number of inches between the two eggs that must be cracked.\nSo 1/4/4 = [(2-sqrt((2-x)*sqrt(1)*x) + sqrt(1-x)*sqrt(*(1-x))))\nSo to get out your last crack, you would take the value of the square root of 0, and then 2^(1-x)*6 * sqrt(x) for example.\nSo you get out your last crack this way: 2^(1-sqrt(*(1-) *(x-2) - sqrt(x-1)*x), where 1 + 2 = 3).\nSo we have 3 eggs cracked on the last try\nSo the final answer here is 3,\nA different number is needed on the second-to-last try with a 0.5*sqr\nBut 2 is the right answer anyway\nSo the final answer really is 3\n\nInput:The bus needs 40 gallons of gasoline.

A player has a chance to draw cards at random everytime he goes under the number.  The first player who runs out of cards goes to the back and tries to draw as many cards as he can.  The goal of a game of Scrabble is to gain enough points to use to move all your letters out of a word.  In one word, 4 letters, one letter is used from A and one from B.  In Scrabble, players are asked to guess the words within two and three letters of a letter.  In Uno, you use eight-letter words like: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, v.  In Scrabbl, you look through all the cards before trying to move all of the letters back into a word.  In Uno they have five colors, a set of three letters, where you are asked to move from A to B.  In Scramble, you have four colors, a set of four letters, where you move from A to B, where you start with A, and start off with B.  In Uno each letter comes from a different color.  In Scrabbb you have 9 letters.  Two letters are from any color.  Eight letters are from your starting letter.  Scrabble has a letter alphabet.

The speed will increase to 15 mph if the current speed reaches 20 mph. The speed will decrease to 15 mph\nOutput: if the speed reaches 25 mph, this means that it will be 1,000 feet long. If the speed is 15 mph, it will take you 2 hours to cover the same distance. If the speed is 10 mph, it will take 2 minutes to cover the same distance\nSo if you were speeding, you'd take 2 * 10 = 60 minutes to go 10 miles.

The speed will decrease 50 mph if the speed is 15 mph faster.\nThe speed will decrease 150 mph if the speed is 10 mph slower.\nIf the speed is 10 mph lower, this means it will be 200 feet long and only 4 inches high.\nIf the speed was 10 mph higher, this means it will increase to 400 feet long and 7 inches high.\nSo if the current speed is 5 mph faster, this means it will have become 200 feet long in 1 hour and 40 minutes. If the current speed is 15 mph faster, this means that it has become 400 feet long in 1 hour.\nIf the current speed is 10mph lower, this means that it is only 90 feet long.

He takes an exit and parks his car. When he enters C, he has $0.40. How many quarters do he take out of his pocket before he gets out of his car?\nOutput: $0.40 - 0.40 = $0\nTherefore, every man should take $0 when he leaves the house.\nThis is equivalent to carrying around $0.10 worth of money every day. (If you leave behind a dollar bill, this amount is deducted from the $0 that you leave behind.)\nBecause the man takes no money from his pocket, let's say that this amount is $1.00. Then the final amount of $1.00 has to come from someone somewhere else, so the amount of money you have goes up by $1.00.\nThis means that every dollar has to be borrowed/given during the day by someone else.\nSo the final value of $1.00 is now $1.03\n\nI think I already did all of the inputs and I didn't include the answer but will do so now...\n\nInput: Let S be a number from 1 to 10.

As he approached his house, and the road was suddenly covered with people coming for a party, it became apparent to both John and himself that it was indeed the last night he was ever likely to see the house where he\u2019d spent most of his life. Knowing that he would never see the place again, John rode the bike to his own home. There he parked the bike, loaded his meager belongings, and loaded them into a plastic container with an air-tight seal, and buried his bicycle somewhere along with a few other essential pieces of his old life into the ground. He then took what he could carry, and hurried away on foot, his bicycle cluttered with everything he still required for his new life. After putting the bicycle to one side, John called out to a passerby, \"I haven\u2019t seen you in a while, have you?\" As the man approached him, John explained to him why he\u2019d been riding without shoes. The man then said, \"I\u2019m sorry to tell you, John, but I got two flat tires.\" \"Thank you,\" responded John. \"Have a good one, too,\" said the man, \"if the other one's a flat too.\" The passing man gave him his cell phone number to help John with a hitchhiking emergency.

{"text": "10\n\nInput:The first place he looked for a house was at a retirement community that had a house for sale at the lowest price.  Then Jason started looking at houses which were available through a \u201clease for lease.\u201d  The first place he looked at had a garage that was built years before and was not in good condition.  It was not even listed for rent on Craigslist.  If he could get the garage fixed up, he may actually have a place to live because there really was no other place with a lease for lease.   If the first two houses did not have any available lease leases, Jason moved on when he found a house with a lease for lease at an affordable price.  So, Jason finally found a house which had no available leases that he could afford to afford.  When he signed the lease, he only paid for the first month and then each subsequent month was free.  The first month was only $300.00 and the second month was only $400.00.  The third month was $600.  The final month, the total was only $100.00.  The total cost to Jason was only $900.00 for the entire $1200.00 that he needed to spend to buy a house.  So, instead of paying $120.00 per month to a \u201clease for sale\u201d for a one bedroom, one bath home in a retirement community with no lease, he paid only $120.00 for the $1200.00 he needed to spend to fix the garage up and then he was able to save $10,000.00 by renting out the house that he no longer needed to rent.  Since he had saved $10,000 from selling the house, he had room in his budget to rent the second garage house with little to no payment to the owner of the first garage house.  But, he and his spouse no longer had to pay $120.00 per monthly rent to the owner of the house.  They could even afford to pay the $300.00 a month they needed to put to borrow for the garage repairs.\n\nInput:Jason and his wife moved into the house. They were paying $70.00 rent for $300.00 rent for the first month.\nOutput: 500\n\ninput:When Jason rented his house, he wanted to rent the house at a fair price.

How do you deal with some of the difficulty you have?\n\nWhen I study in the classroom I am going to be constantly exposed to new facts and things I did not know before.  The teacher is going to be teaching me things that I don\u2019t already know and using words I never before used.  Study would basically be a collection of facts and concepts I already have a grasp on.  I would have to go over these things several times to find what I had missed or had forgotten.\n\nWhen I study at home the information is already in the past and has happened on my own.  If I have questions I can Google them and find the answer right away.  This means I have a direct link to the information I need that day, and it will not have to be covered again in class or in a different book I am reading.  So if I find that I do not have an understanding of an idea a specific question may give me the answer I\u2019m looking for and help move me further.\n\nQuestion #26: What are the best methods to learn something that you didn\u2019t know before, but know after?\n\nI use a few methods to learn any new concept.

Other methods consist of me looking it up on my own and seeing if I didn\u2019t understand it, which is why I", "answer": "C: study"}

A security guard from the company was sitting at a cash register when he saw a man who looked like the man with the red shirt with a bandanna on his head.  The cashier tried to ID the man by touching his face, but he was in the way.  The cashier took out his pocketbook and went to the men\u2019s room to change the locks.

The EPA proposes that in addition to having to buy gasoline in gallons, the cars must have on the dashboard at least two display indicators that indicate (A) fuel economy (B) driving.  How many miles must a car buy to get this symbol?  How many must the cars be allowed to have?  This is the first time in history that such a cap existed.

The most destructive one occurred in 1876.  It produced a devastating earthquake and a massive tsunami in the North Pacific Ocean.  The earthquake and tsunami caused more than $400 billion in damage, more than half of its toll being on the coast.  A team of scientists from the US Geological Survey (USGS) set out to understand how the quake and the tsunami were produced.\n2.  The ocean has become the world's largest river system.  It's a slow-moving, freshwater river network that originates in the Arctic and flows through various parts of the US and Europe before emptying out into the Pacific Ocean.  It has caused problems for some cities because it does not hold back its floodwaters during bad weather.  In 1999, a major flooding event in Minneapolis caused serious problems for the city.  The flooding event flooded homes and businesses, flooded parking lots and streets, and submerged and damaged thousands of acres of farmland, including parts of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.  In the years before the flood, the city had failed to implement adequate storm drainage systems.\n3.

{"text": "40\n(the answer is B)\n\nIn the above question, the reader was asked to estimate the speed of a fast moving train at a given speed at which it is passing a speed measuring device. In order to calculate the time from the start to reach certain distance on the specified distance a calculation must be made.\n\nTo calculate the length and rate of travel of a given length of line, the equation below may be used which involves finding a point at which a line reaches a given distance, finding the distance along that line and dividing that value by the line\u2019s length (in meters/diameters).\n\nThis equation shows that if the line is at the end of a straight line, the line will travel along the line at the same rate; however, if the line is curved, and the distance along the line exceeds the line\u2019s travel length, the line will slow down or even stop, depending on the curvature of the line itself.\n\nExample:\n\nThe train is traveling at 1 km/h and moves at a distance of 50 meters.

Remember, you don't have to know an exact number of hours per week to get the point.\n\nNow, think about an answer to this question that requires you to make an effort rather than one that is completely automatic. (This is probably harder, but think about a harder level of difficulty and you can probably figure it out).\n\nI would like to know what it was...\n\nIf someone approaches me, I'd say:\n\nA: \"Nice to meet you\", maybe\nB: some sort of compliment\nC: \"It's pretty good to see you\"\nD: popularity\nE: understand myself\n\nIf someone approached me:\nA: \"Nice meeting you\"\nB: whatever they mean by it\nC: compliments\nD: some sort of approval\nE: some sort of understanding\n\nThe other answer(s) are:\nA: \"Sorry. Don't know who you are, probably\"\nB: some sort approval and/or understanding\nC: some interest, even if superficial\nD: popularity\n\nWhat kind of effort would you say the answer required? If you didn't expect it and it really helped them, that would definitely count. If you knew their name and how to say hi without looking like a total flake, that's a bit more effort.\nNow, there are many ways to evaluate how hard someone else is trying. For example, if someone came to you, and said, \"Your work is great! We have an idea for the site we'd like to set up on the blog.\" Would you evaluate them based on how excited they seemed? Would you ask them where they're from? What are some specific traits that they think you do well? Would you ask them what they're paying for the blog you're trying to set up on the site?\n\nSome examples of \"effort\" people respond to, in order of importance:\nA) You see me, and I respond with some initial interest.\nB) The person approaches me, and I don't respond.\nC) I have an idea for the blog I want to set up, and they approach me. I say yes if they ask.\nD) If I see them doing something or say something, I respond with some short comment.\nE)", "answer": "D: popularity"}

{"text": "A\n\n1, The animal transport truck holds only 20 head of cattle. That is 20 animals per truck, but Eric's truck holds 40 animals per truck.  This means that it will take Eric 8 hours to transport those 20 animals to higher ground.  How fast would it have to travel to 60 miles/hour to ensure that it can get all the way to the airport in time to land?\n\nAnswer: 1, The animal transport truck would have to travel at 60 miles-per-hour. This means that it would travel at a slower pace of 20 miles-per-hour than Eric's truck, giving it 1/4 of the time to complete the flight.\n\n2, Traveling at a slower rate of 60 miles-per-hr doesn't mean that the passenger is getting a faster trip than the driver. The passenger needs to be within sight of their desired destination, where both the driver and the passenger can view the destination. If the passenger is in an adjacent room, it will take the driver longer, which means they will arrive at the destination at a later time, resulting in a shorter trip.

{"text": "100\n\nInput: A woman who has been traveling to the same city for years wants to retire, but when the time came to pick up her retirement plans she was disappointed.   After several years of traveling the woman decided to sell the house and move to a more affordable place.  She decided to get a second job.  She hired a real estate agent to look for a new house to rent.  The woman listed the house for sale at $3500 per month.  She offered $6000 in equity as the deposit for the property.  Her agent found an interested buyer for the house.  The buyer came back two weeks later and offered $6500 less than the listed price.  The agent told the woman that a higher sale price would have been necessary.  The woman didn\u00b4t want to sell.  The woman refused to close the sale on principle.  The agent informed the woman that, since the asking price was off the seller\u00b4s $3500, the seller would have to pay only her $6000.  The woman then refused to close the sale at the $6000 price.  Finally, the woman came back to the agent and said she would close the sale of the home if the current price was returned, because she didn\u00b4t want the new buyer to be disappointed.  The agent said to her, the house will be sold for exactly the amount of money the seller was willing to spend to buy it.  The agent told her that it would be illegal to give more money than the sale price, as no one would be allowed to buy the property at less than the price.  The woman then said she would sell the house to the buyer at the $6500 price.  The agent asked the woman to call him at the phone number listed as agent on the property description.  The agent called the woman twice on the second attempt and both calls were answered by the buyer.  The second buyer asked to talk to the agent.  The agent called back a third time and the woman hung up on him.  Once he called back, the woman was able to talk calmly and without animosity to both the buyer and seller.  Both sellers and buyer walked away with happy endings.  The seller of the house was able to move into the house she listed on the real estate agent's website at less than her original asking price.  The woman is now happy with the housing market in Texas and looks forward to retiring.\nInput: You need to give the question in 3 parts", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

{"text": "C\n\nHow to Write an Argumentative Essay (A.I.T.)\n\nYour argument essay would have one main purpose; provide a strong argument for your position. Your argument would be based on your knowledge of the topic at hand. You would analyze the source material and provide a reason for your own opinion of the topic of the paper. Make sure that the argument you will be writing is sound and logical as well.\n\nArguments (A.I.Ts)\n\nHere are three types of arguments:\n\n1. Point based:\n\nThis type of argument is when the writer explains a reasoning. When an argument is this type of, the most important part of the paper is using the argument to prove to readers that the writer has a reliable and logical thought process.\n\n2. Structure based:\n\nThis argument includes points about how logic works and how we can apply logic to situations. It is important to choose a logical structure when writing an argument in which the writer demonstrates how logical he is to make his point.\n\n3. Argumentative\n\nThis type of type of argument, is when the writer uses facts in their argument to make a point. It is important to keep this type of argument relevant and interesting. This type of argument is usually written to make another person think and to persuade him to rethink his opinion.\n\nArguments vs. Essays\n\nHere are some great points about writing an opinion essay that may help when writing your own opinion essay.\n\n1. Arguments are not essays.\n\nWriting an opinion essay is to express your personal opinion; it is not an essay. Arguments have a lot more information that can be included and sometimes an essay will use only a certain portion of the information. An essay may include your view on the topic but it will not use facts that do not support that view.\n\n2. Arguments are about opinions.\n\nWriting an essay on something you have never even seen, or heard of is not the same as writing an argumentative essay on the topic. All arguments are based in something that is already established. As soon as the reader looks at the information he sees the main argument and a different view is provided on that specific subject matter. Arguments are a way of showing that the writer has a strong opinion.\n\n3. Essays are about facts and logic and information.\n\nArguments take a lot of information that already exists. If you have a lot of research done", "answer": "E: neatness"}

The simulation was designed to simulate commuting times, number of miles driven, and fuel consumption when a car is idle and traveling at 60 mph for five days. The results were compared to real-life data collected from an Argonne national lab (Argonne) model fleet of 10 vehicles, and these results indicated that the energy costs (in energy, energy density, and gross emissions) would be similar for the commuting scenario. However, fuel consumption would be significantly higher for a commuter scenario because of commuting trips. For each day the family was not in New York City, driving would add $1,400 to their total costs, mainly due to fuel consumption. Additionally, based on fuel density of gasoline, a typical driver in our model consumes 15 liters of gasoline per 100 km, but this could be different depending on the location of the vehicle. Energy consumption and costs are based on what it would be as a commuter with a vehicle like the gasoline-powered vehicle at Argonne.\n\n[edit] Instructions:1.

Well, I haven't \"officially\" quit yet. I have given in to my urges on several occasions though. I have a nice group of friends and a wife that encourages me. I have a little of a life.

You'll think you can't quit tomorrow, but you must believe in yourself because it will get easier.\n\nMy wife is a former addict and I'm fortunate enough to have managed to quit almost 6 years ago. I never want to go through that again.\n\nIf you are truly ready to make that step then congratulations. It is a big leap forward.\n\nIf you choose not to, your life will just continue the way it has been.\n\nThat's nice. I've made decisions that I regretted a lot of time later, so you're welcome to hope I'll regret mine, too.\n\nSo, if I'm still here in this forum five years from now, will I still be able to help you?\n\n---\nI guess so, if you ask me.

It is almost impossible to know which one you will be working with if you don\u2019t know a little bit about the different styles of methods and which methods will most suit your needs.\n\nThere are three basic types of methods for getting other people to help you:\n\n1. You do it yourself: you get a friend to do it for you.\n\n2. Friends help you: your friends help you work the job for you. Sometimes you can get things for nothing, and sometimes you can be expected to do things that may not really cost you much if you want your friends to help you (e.g., doing errands, doing chores, cleaning out their cars, hiring an extra person, etc.).\n\n3. Others help you: your friends will do jobs or other things for you without you paying them. This is generally preferred to 2. and 3. as you are paying (or, at your company, not paying) for them to do their job for you.\n\nWhen you choose this method, you are setting yourself up for some potential pitfalls, problems, or pitfalls. First, you will have to be comfortable in working with strangers.

This is because the person must be very careful when using their arm to push objects.\nWhen the monkey was in the cage, they only walked around the cage and sat in the floor and waited for the end of the day.  Once it was ready to leave the cage, they ran out of the cage and into the street, and were very excited.\nWhen the person takes a break in the middle of the day and leaves to change the car oil and then comes back in the middle of the night, it does not matter what type of car they went in, it will take only a day for the arm to recover and be ready to leave the car, and get back to their work.\nWhen the person is walking down the street in rain forest, they usually sit in the floor and don\u2019t move.  This is because they can\u2019t move their arms out of the way of traffic, and they also don\u2019t want to make noise while walking.\nWhen the people move to a research facility, they are more careful with objects they pick up and throw, and wear special costumes.

When we moved to the South, all of our activities, especially going to pick up mail and mail boxes, and take the car out to go to the Post Office, had to be very careful not to get hit by cars.

Each animal in a herd can be a sheep, a goat, or a dog.  Each animal in the herd can be male or female, and have one or more offspring which are the same as the mother\u2019s.  Every animal has a different set of characteristics, depending on the type; color, markings, or sex.  Females produce milk, while males produce dung and other body wastes.  A herd is a group of animals that live in the same area as a source of food or water.  A herd consists of several hundred animals, and most are owned by many different people.  A herd\u2019s population consists of several types, such as sheep, goats, cattle, deer, raccoons, and others.  A herd is considered the product of a herd management plan.  A herd management plan defines the objectives, goals, strategies, and processes by which animals are utilized within a herd.  A herd management program must be initiated with the goal of achieving herd management objectives.  A herd is self-sustaining with an ongoing supply of food, water, shelter, and nutrients.  A herd is usually self-sustaining as long as its population does not exceed a certain number.  A herd is also self-sustaining on a seasonal basis \u2014 for example, every day in September the weather patterns, seasons, and wildlife populations change enough that the herds might be exposed to the cold weather to prevent the animals from surviving.

If the user accidentally clicks a link that leads to the corrupted file, it will create a problem for him.  The user is not supposed to select the incorrect or incorrect link because it will cause the file to corrupt.  If the user clicks a link on the computer that will lead to a corrupted area, it will likely not stop that file from corrupting.  The user is asked how many files he will visit while the computer is running.  The user is required to choose at least three files, and three other, non-corrupted files.  The computer needs to select five different links at least in order to work correctly.  The computer is asking the user if he would like to delete any of the other, non-corrupt files or whether he would like to delete and re-add items from his choices.

That means you\u2019ll have to pay more for rent in one place and pay less in the other.  What difference would you notice?\nOutput:\n3.  You could take advantage of the property manager\u2019s offering of a full first month free.  Would that be a benefit?\nOutput:\n4.  You could rent 1 and not the 2.  That means you can pay more for rent in the one place and pay less for rent in the other.  Would this benefit you?\nOutput:\n5.  You could not rent 1 and not the 1 and then the 2.  That would be a waste of money!\nOutput:\n6.  You could only rent the 2 and not the 1.  That way the management can do a one size fits all assessment and charge less.  It will be cheaper this way.\nOutput:\n7.  The 1 and the 2 could use the same utilities since they\u2019ll be both rented from the property manager.\nOutput:\n8. There is an extra fee for a check out.  Check out times vary for the 2 apartments.  Is that fair?\nOutput:\n9.  The 2 apartments have different rules about leaving dishes outside.  There\u2019s a minimum and maximum number. What\u2019s the most amount you could ask for?\nOutput:\n10. You are a parent and son.

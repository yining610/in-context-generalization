As he approached his house, and the road was suddenly covered with people coming for a party, it became apparent to both John and himself that it was indeed the last night he was ever likely to see the house where he’d spent most of his life. Knowing that he would never see the place again, John rode the bike to his own home. There he parked the bike, loaded his meager belongings, and loaded them into a plastic container with an air-tight seal, and buried his bicycle somewhere along with a few other essential pieces of his old life into the ground. He then took what he could carry, and hurried away on foot, his bicycle cluttered with everything he still required for his new life. After putting the bicycle to one side, John called out to a passerby, "I haven’t seen you in a while, have you?" As the man approached him, John explained to him why he’d been riding without shoes. The man then said, "I’m sorry to tell you, John, but I got two flat tires." "Thank you," responded John. "Have a good one, too," said the man, "if the other one's a flat too." The passing man gave him his cell phone number to help John with a hitchhiking emergency. Later that day, a passerby told John that he’d also fallen on hard times himself, as he was now living with his father. John replied to his father, "Your home looks nice, Dad. I need a place to crash when I come out." With that, John headed North into the forest. Soon after, he was picked up by a man who claimed to be a friend of both his father and John’s. He gave John his room, though John knew that what he was really hoping to find was somebody who would take him to the nearest place he could catch a ride with a friend and family member. By the time John arrived at his father’s, however, he realized that even his friend was on vacation, and nobody wanted to hitchhike to New York City this weekend. John ended up renting a room in his fathers’ apartment for the time being. Over the next several days, he stayed in touch with his friend and family members. On Tuesday, July 18th, he learned that both his friend and his

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.

Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: 800<n><n>Input:Where is likely to have a lot of fire extinguishers? Choices:  A: garage B: hospital C: boat D: house E: doll house<n>Output:		 10<n><n>Input:The first place he looked for a house was at a retirement community that had a house for sale at the lowest price.  Then Jason started looking at houses which were available through a “lease for lease.”  The first place he looked at had a garage that was built years before and was not in good condition.  It was not even listed for rent on Craigslist.  If he could get the garage fixed up, he may actually have a place to live because there really was no other place with a lease for lease.   If the first two houses did not have any available lease leases, Jason moved on when he found a house with a lease for lease at an affordable price.  So, Jason finally found a house which had no available leases that he could afford to afford.  When he signed the lease, he only paid for the first month and then each subsequent month was free.  The first month was only $300.00 and the second month was only $400.00.  The third month was $600.  The final month, the total was only $100.00.  The total cost to Jason was only $900.00 for the entire $1200.00 that he needed to spend to buy a house.  So, instead of paying $120.00 per month to a “lease for sale” for a one bedroom, one bath home in a retirement community with no lease, he paid only $120.00 for the $1200.00 he needed to spend to fix the garage up and then he was able to save $10,000.00 by renting out the house that he no longer needed to rent.  Since he had saved $10,000 from selling the house, he had room in his budget to rent the second garage house with little to no payment to the owner of the first garage house.  But, he and his spouse no longer had to pay $120.00 per monthly rent to the owner of the house.  They could even afford to pay the $300.00 a month they needed to put to borrow for the garage repairs.<n><n>Input:Jason and his wife moved into the house. They were paying $70.00 rent for $300.00 rent for the first month.<n>Output: 500<n><n>input:When Jason rented his house, he wanted to rent the house at a fair price.  He first looked at some homes with leases for lease on Craigslist.<n>Output: 150<n>

(ie by the same experience from the  teacher, your peers, or your own examples.)<n> Input: 2. Why is study for you different from exposure?<n> Output: 3. When you feel that you’ve learned something, did you know/feel better after the experience, or the other way around?<n>Output: 4. How often has your life been influenced by what you learned from exposure?<n>Output: 5. What do you think the biggest effect of experience is?<n>Output: 6. What makes a teacher good or bad?<n>Output: 7. Have you felt that you learn more from experience or study?<n>Output: 8. What is wrong with study?<n> Output (the same answer as #2): study is better than exposure<n><n>Question #25: What is the difference between learning in the classroom and studying at home?  How do you deal with some of the difficulty you have?<n><n>When I study in the classroom I am going to be constantly exposed to new facts and things I did not know before.  The teacher is going to be teaching me things that I don’t already know and using words I never before used.  Study would basically be a collection of facts and concepts I already have a grasp on.  I would have to go over these things several times to find what I had missed or had forgotten.<n><n>When I study at home the information is already in the past and has happened on my own.  If I have questions I can Google them and find the answer right away.  This means I have a direct link to the information I need that day, and it will not have to be covered again in class or in a different book I am reading.  So if I find that I do not have an understanding of an idea a specific question may give me the answer I’m looking for and help move me further.<n><n>Question #26: What are the best methods to learn something that you didn’t know before, but know after?<n><n>I use a few methods to learn any new concept.  Some of them consist of me learning slowly and then repeating my effort until it is a clear thing.  Other methods consist of me looking it up on my own and seeing if I didn’t understand it, which is why I

A security guard from the company was sitting at a cash register when he saw a man who looked like the man with the red shirt with a bandanna on his head.  The cashier tried to ID the man by touching his face, but he was in the way.  The cashier took out his pocketbook and went to the men’s room to change the locks.  At the gas station, the cashier told the clerk something in a foreign language.  In an adjoining parking lot, a woman had been in the line behind the cashier only minutes earlier.  In this place, everything that moved, she could see.  Then she saw the man with the red T-shirt.  The man asked her how she knew him, and she told him that they had met in the line.  She could see that the clerk knew who she was.  The man asked again how she knew him.  The clerk explained again that they’d met in the line.<n><n>As soon as the cashier left the gas station, the clerk called his supervisor to let him know that he’d be late to work.  The supervisor, who did not speak English, said that he couldn’t understand the cashier.  Then the clerk showed him that his name is Eric and that he had used the cashier’s name on his credit card.  That evening, while in the line at the supermarket, the clerk saw one of the people behind him had used the cashier as well, trying to get a free ice cream cone without paying.  The clerk could see that the man with the red bandanna on had tried to grab a free ice cream cone while still in the line, and he had tried to grab a soda without paying.  That night, both the clerk and the supervisor noticed that they had used the same credit cards.  When they confronted the people who used their credit cards on the same day, it turned out that a third man was using the third man’s credit card under a fake name.  The third man’s name was Carlos, and the man he had used the third man’ s credit card with was also Carlos.  While talking to Carlos, the clerk found out that Carlos had tried to use his company’s credit

If students can learn to shut up and listen, our classroom experience will be smoother and more cohesive. (This is why students learn to think before they speak.) If students feel as though “I know it all,” they will lose interest and make mistakes. On the other hand, students who take “I know it,” too far may be too aggressive and may fail altogether.<n>To teach students to shut up and listen you must know the difference. When someone is talking, you can hear what is being said, and when someone is typing, you can copy what they are typing. When it comes to speaking, the speaker is the only one giving their thoughts, so the only way you can know what their voice is saying (or are thinking) is if you look straight at them and listen to what they are saying.<n><n>### When students learn to work together, it is an opportunity to improve.<n><n>Input: Students have been instructed to “work together” to study a book for the first time.

He asked his girlfriend, but she told him there was something wrong with her car and she would not be able to get it working.  He talked to his wife, and she told him there was nothing wrong with her car, and would bring it to Bennet on Wednesday.

There have been many earthquakes in the western part of the United States over the last couple hundred years.  The most destructive one occurred in 1876.  It produced a devastating earthquake and a massive tsunami in the North Pacific Ocean.

The flooding event flooded homes and businesses, flooded parking lots and streets, and submerged and damaged thousands of acres of farmland, including parts of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.  In the years before the flood, the city had failed to implement adequate storm drainage systems.<n>3.

The music was great, and I learned a lot about music theory and composition. However, it's been a while since I played the guitar. We practiced for about an hour, after learning the chord progressions, and then the real test appeared. I played "Liszt's Piano Concerto No.1." I took the guitar back to the house at night, and I sat down to practice. I got about 5 minutes into the piece, and I remembered that I was supposed to be playing bass. I was embarrassed, so I quit. However, I thought of my teacher, who told me to not look back, and started practicing again. It really helped to remember that she didn't like me playing the bass part either, like so many players do. The next day, I remembered to play the bass part, only this time I played it properly! I'm getting better, although I'm not playing much yet. I'm going to take lessons soon, but you can't get better unless you actually play the guitar. How do you get good? There's no way out.

Remember, you don't have to know an exact number of hours per week to get the point.<n><n>Now, think about an answer to this question that requires you to make an effort rather than one that is completely automatic. (This is probably harder, but think about a harder level of difficulty and you can probably figure it out).<n><n>I would like to know what it was...<n><n>If someone approaches me, I'd say:<n><n>A: "Nice to meet you", maybe<n>B: some sort of compliment<n>C: "It's pretty good to see you"<n>D: popularity<n>E: understand myself<n><n>If someone approached me:<n>A: "Nice meeting you"<n>B: whatever they mean by it<n>C: compliments<n>D: some sort of approval<n>E: some sort of understanding<n><n>The other answer(s) are:<n>A: "Sorry. Don't know who you are, probably"<n>B: some sort approval and/or understanding<n>C: some interest, even if superficial<n>D: popularity<n><n>What kind of effort would you say the answer required? If you didn't expect it and it really helped them, that would definitely count. If you knew their name and how to say hi without looking like a total flake, that's a bit more effort.<n>Now, there are many ways to evaluate how hard someone else is trying. For example, if someone came to you, and said, "Your work is great! We have an idea for the site we'd like to set up on the blog." Would you evaluate them based on how excited they seemed? Would you ask them where they're from? What are some specific traits that they think you do well? Would you ask them what they're paying for the blog you're trying to set up on the site?<n><n>Some examples of "effort" people respond to, in order of importance:<n>A) You see me, and I respond with some initial interest.<n>B) The person approaches me, and I don't respond.<n>C) I have an idea for the blog I want to set up, and they approach me. I say yes if they ask.<n>D) If I see them doing something or say something, I respond with some short comment.<n>E)

Calculate the miles it takes to move each item.  What if all of your cars have a higher price tag?  What about items that are all in the same box?  You may find that you have to move all of your boxes together.  Calculate the total miles from the garage to your house per week.<n>Output: 60<n>____________<n><n>Input:A car with a 6-cylinder engine costs $20,000, making the car’s current value $65,000.  The next car in the line was priced at $28,000, so you can estimate that the engine in the current car would cost $10,000.  The value of the car is $28,520.  The total is $61,520 after tax and insurance.  The value of this year’s car is $55,520.  The value of your 2000 car is $35,520.  This year’s car also has a new radiator, which costs $1,400.  Thus the total cost is $55,520 to your 2000 car.  You now have $56,520 in your 2000 account.  What do you do with the 2000 account?  Return to the 2000 account?  Add a $1,400 charge to the account in the form of a fee for the radiator?  Pay off your 2000 car?  Take $3,100 for your 2000 car and take out the $1,400 radiator charge, leaving $56,520 in the 2000 account, of which about $3,800 is used for vehicle maintenance?  The total cost of $56,520 would be $5,520, leaving $41,520 in the 2000 car.  This is your 2000 profit.<n>Output: 3 ____________

His youngest son moves to Australia.

The eldest son asks the middle son whether he has done so. The middle son says no, but he has no idea why his middle son did it. When he tries to explain, he gets into an argument with his father about it, and decides to ask his younger brother if he wants to change his name so his middle name cannot be found.

When he arrives in England, he discovers that his youngest son is named Michael.  When his father asks for his middle son’s last name, the youngest son tells his father that his middle name is Michael, and that he has changed it because his middle name was too close to his family name.  His father says he has not moved house, there is no problem with his home or the family name, and that if he does, he will not ask his English son to come to stay with him.

The eldest son moves next door and helps his family keep the house in England. When his family return to Australia, the eldest son finds that his middle name is being replaced by his middle brother’s middle name

After several years of traveling the woman decided to sell the house and move to a more affordable place.  She decided to get a second job.  She hired a real estate agent to look for a new house to rent.  The woman listed the house for sale at $3500 per month.  She offered $6000 in equity as the deposit for the property.  Her agent found an interested buyer for the house.  The buyer came back two weeks later and offered $6500 less than the listed price.  The agent told the woman that a higher sale price would have been necessary.  The woman didn´t want to sell.  The woman refused to close the sale on principle.  The agent informed the woman that, since the asking price was off the seller´s $3500, the seller would have to pay only her $6000.  The woman then refused to close the sale at the $6000 price.  Finally, the woman came back to the agent and said she would close the sale of the home if the current price was returned, because she didn´t want the new buyer to be disappointed.  The agent said to her, the house will be sold for exactly the amount of money the seller was willing to spend to buy it.  The agent told her that it would be illegal to give more money than the sale price, as no one would be allowed to buy the property at less than the price.  The woman then said she would sell the house to the buyer at the $6500 price.  The agent asked the woman to call him at the phone number listed as agent on the property description.  The agent called the woman twice on the second attempt and both calls were answered by the buyer.  The second buyer asked to talk to the agent.  The agent called back a third time and the woman hung up on him.  Once he called back, the woman was able to talk calmly and without animosity to both the buyer and seller.  Both sellers and buyer walked away with happy endings.  The seller of the house was able to move into the house she listed on the real estate agent's website at less than her original asking price.  The woman is now happy with the housing market in Texas and looks forward to retiring.<n>Input: You need to give the question in 3 parts

Your argument would be based on your knowledge of the topic at hand. You would analyze the source material and provide a reason for your own opinion of the topic of the paper. Make sure that the argument you will be writing is sound and logical as well.<n><n>Arguments (A.I.Ts)<n><n>Here are three types of arguments:<n><n>1. Point based:<n><n>This type of argument is when the writer explains a reasoning. When an argument is this type of, the most important part of the paper is using the argument to prove to readers that the writer has a reliable and logical thought process.<n><n>2. Structure based:<n><n>This argument includes points about how logic works and how we can apply logic to situations. It is important to choose a logical structure when writing an argument in which the writer demonstrates how logical he is to make his point.<n><n>3. Argumentative<n><n>This type of type of argument, is when the writer uses facts in their argument to make a point. It is important to keep this type of argument relevant and interesting. This type of argument is usually written to make another person think and to persuade him to rethink his opinion.<n><n>Arguments vs. Essays<n><n>Here are some great points about writing an opinion essay that may help when writing your own opinion essay.<n><n>1. Arguments are not essays.<n><n>Writing an opinion essay is to express your personal opinion; it is not an essay. Arguments have a lot more information that can be included and sometimes an essay will use only a certain portion of the information. An essay may include your view on the topic but it will not use facts that do not support that view.<n><n>2. Arguments are about opinions.<n><n>Writing an essay on something you have never even seen, or heard of is not the same as writing an argumentative essay on the topic. All arguments are based in something that is already established. As soon as the reader looks at the information he sees the main argument and a different view is provided on that specific subject matter. Arguments are a way of showing that the writer has a strong opinion.<n><n>3. Essays are about facts and logic and information.<n><n>Arguments take a lot of information that already exists. If you have a lot of research done

Mollaeesi (mollaeesi@caltech.edu) in Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California)<n><n>This activity was developed at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Argonne National Laboratory and funded by the U.S. Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). The aim of this scenario simulation was to examine the effects of a storm on transportation and energy costs of a family. The simulation was designed to simulate commuting times, number of miles driven, and fuel consumption when a car is idle and traveling at 60 mph for five days. The results were compared to real-life data collected from an Argonne national lab (Argonne) model fleet of 10 vehicles, and these results indicated that the energy costs (in energy, energy density, and gross emissions) would be similar for the commuting scenario. However, fuel consumption would be significantly higher for a commuter scenario because of commuting trips. For each day the family was not in New York City, driving would add $1,400 to their total costs, mainly due to fuel consumption. Additionally, based on fuel density of gasoline, a typical driver in our model consumes 15 liters of gasoline per 100 km, but this could be different depending on the location of the vehicle.

This is because the person must be very careful when using their arm to push objects.<n>When the monkey was in the cage, they only walked around the cage and sat in the floor and waited for the end of the day.  Once it was ready to leave the cage, they ran out of the cage and into the street, and were very excited.<n>When the person takes a break in the middle of the day and leaves to change the car oil and then comes back in the middle of the night, it does not matter what type of car they went in, it will take only a day for the arm to recover and be ready to leave the car, and get back to their work.<n>When the person is walking down the street in rain forest, they usually sit in the floor and don’t move.  This is because they can’t move their arms out of the way of traffic, and they also don’t want to make noise while walking.<n>When the people move to a research facility, they are more careful with objects they pick up and throw, and wear special costumes.  They try to pick up things with their arms that a monkey cannot without causing the monkeys to jump out of the cages.  After they move to the treetops, monkeys try to sit in trees and wait for visitors, if a visitor comes over to sit with them, the monkeys know that the visitor is going in the office to work on a project.  When we moved to the South, all of our activities, especially going to pick up mail and mail boxes, and take the car out to go to the Post Office, had to be very careful not to get hit by cars. This is because even monkeys that walk on the street can run into cars when people are walking by them.<n>When the person moves to south africa, the biggest worry is if someone accidentally knocks their car over while they are at work.

Each animal in a herd can be a sheep, a goat, or a dog.  Each animal in the herd can be male or female, and have one or more offspring which are the same as the mother’s.  Every animal has a different set of characteristics, depending on the type; color, markings, or sex.  Females produce milk, while males produce dung and other body wastes.  A herd is a group of animals that live in the same area as a source of food or water.  A herd consists of several hundred animals, and most are owned by many different people.  A herd’s population consists of several types, such as sheep, goats, cattle, deer, raccoons, and others.  A herd is considered the product of a herd management plan.  A herd management plan defines the objectives, goals, strategies, and processes by which animals are utilized within a herd.  A herd management program must be initiated with the goal of achieving herd management objectives.  A herd is self-sustaining with an ongoing supply of food, water, shelter, and nutrients.  A herd is usually self-sustaining as long as its population does not exceed a certain number.  A herd is also self-sustaining on a seasonal basis — for example, every day in September the weather patterns, seasons, and wildlife populations change enough that the herds might be exposed to the cold weather to prevent the animals from surviving. In the winter, if the wildlife are not available to provide enough food, the winter supply of available food and shelter must be supplemented to meet the animals’ needs, to

When the user goes to select a file, he is asked to check for a problem, such as a file is corrupted.  The user will probably have to click an incorrect or incorrect link.  If the user accidentally clicks a link that leads to the corrupted file, it will create a problem for him.  The user is not supposed to select the incorrect or incorrect link because it will cause the file to corrupt.  If the user clicks a link on the computer that will lead to a corrupted area, it will likely not stop that file from corrupting.  The user is asked how many files he will visit while the computer is running.  The user is required to choose at least three files, and three other, non-corrupted files.  The computer needs to select five different links at least in order to work correctly.  The computer is asking the user if he would like to delete any of the other, non-corrupt files or whether he would like to delete and re-add items from his choices.  The user is told to delete and re-import the files, and to erase any areas around the screen where the user has clicked the incorrect link.  The computer needs the user to select nine different links.  It selects six choices, and asks the user if he wants to delete any of those choices.  The computer needs all nine clicks for the program to work properly, because at least seven of the nine choices have to be clicked.  The computer needs at least four clicks for the program to recognize that the user has clicked a link.  The computer wants the user to make the exact same choice in order for the program to work correctly.  If the user selects the wrong choice in a non-corrupted area, it

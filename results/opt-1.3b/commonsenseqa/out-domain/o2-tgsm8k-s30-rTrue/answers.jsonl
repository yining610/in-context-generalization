How often, in miles, has the dog traveled recently, and in years?  Output:The dog's behavior last month led to a 3 mile, 5 year stretch of driving.  Average annual travel distance from home\n\nInput:How many days do you expect to spend in Washington, DC? How many days have you already spent in Washington, DC and why?\nOutput:The total number of miles is 15,000. You have traveled 7,000 of those. Assuming that you arrive on Friday of your next visit, your total total number of miles traveled in Washington, DC, is 15,000 - (7,000/5) = 7,000, which is less than 7,000 days. Since your total miles only increased by 7,000 this month, you can count the last three days as your first 100 days and this month as your last 100 days. Your total total number of miles is therefore only 15,000/50 = 9,800.\nInput:How many nights are you spending at the National Parks? Answer: 10 nights\nYou went to 3 parks, stayed at 3 nights but not 5 nights.  So each night you did not have 2 nights left.  Therefore, you did not complete 5 nights of National Park lodging.  Since you did not continue to camp at the National Parks, you did not complete 100 nights in one place.  This would leave you with 15 days in Washington, DC and 60 days in one park, which you haven't done yet. So each night you stayed at the parks was equivalent to 1 night in Washington, DC.   Each night you did not sleep at the National Parks was equivalent to 1 night of Washington, DC.

{"text": "Divorce is a relationship status that involves a court order.\nA marriage is a relationship status where either party has legally stated that they're going to live together in one and only one marriage and that one and only one person has the final say over how the relationship is managed. (ie. marriage/divorce)\nA relationship between 2 or more people is not a relationship status.\nA relationship between a single person and themselves is not a relationship status\n\nComments\n\nAs a teacher, I agree with the previous poster that the math may not be quite right. But even so, when you've been married for a year or three years or even ten years, divorce is pretty much inevitable. For what it's worth, I've been married 20 years. When we broke up, it didn't take long at all to get a divorce granted. It's just a matter of finding a judge who's willing. This is not to say that the odds of divorce are 100% but just be prepared to fight for your side of the house. Good luck!\n\nI've been married for 7 years. We haven't lived together for six of those 7 years, and there is a legal order against us. My attorney did a great job, and we're very happy. I'm surprised that the OP didn't ask about family law, and the effects of changing family relationships on children's development. I hope this post sparks some discussion.\n\nWhile having lived together for 6 (or 7?) of those 7 years the legal requirements would have been quite high to get a divorce. I can't imagine a judge being willing to take it on unless it was extremely severe. If I read your title correctly, this was either a \"relationship status\" question on an online quiz or something to that effect. If the answer to the question in question was \"married,\" you would have a very hard time getting divorce. If you answered differently it would have made more sense.\nYour answer, \"we haven't lived together\" is incorrect. You can live together as long as you are married. This could have been phrased to seem like people live together as long as they live separate, however in most states (at least on my end) one must live with the other spouse's legal name on their tax/bank accounts and social security cards, so that one does not become an \"adult\" without actually having been legally married.

Therefore, you do not need to cross the border at airports. You can drop the goods in your garage at a cross over. The freight transportation is cheaper than what you pay for crossing borders at airports.\nTherefore, the final answer is Freights transportation.\n\nThe above question is supposed to be about a hypothetical situation where you have to deliver the product to someone in a remote country where you have no one or where you have no money. The task is to come up with two possible ways of sending freight and costs associated with those costs. There should be some estimate of costs, such as time and money. This is supposed to be a comparative-marketing question.\nSuppose you have to deliver an item of clothing with 50 pairs of socks to a family in the remote country. The clothing is valued the same as a pair of socks. The socks are 50 cents each. You have to deliver the clothing on a boat. The cost would be $50. Then you have to pay for fuel and the cost of the sailboat. The cost of the sailboat would be $1,500 for one pair of shoes. The freight component and fuel (fuel costs) would account for the total freight costs.

Choices: A: $10 cash B: $10 in savings C: $10 in credit card D: $15 in debit card E: $500 in cash\nOutput: Assuming the car is in a state of maintenance, the car owner will need $500 from their savings to pay for maintenance.  Since $1000 will cover routine maintenance such as engine oil changes, it will be less than $500.  The car will need $500 added for repairs for all of the $1,000 costs.  Then the car owner will need to add $100 per year to their credit card debt in order to cover the new debt.  At what rate will this annual debt be added in 2 years after that?\nOutput: Assuming a car is rented for one week, the rental rate will be $30/day for the first week or $190 for the entire rental. How much would the owner pay for the rental?  Output: Suppose the car has $0 in repairs, and the car has $0 depreciation. Then the price of the car divided by the ownership cost ($0) is $7.50/day. This is the initial value of the rental, divided by the ownership cost. So at this price the total monthly rent (rent + depreciation) will be $140.\nOutput: Assume that a rental car company offers 30 day rentals. Based on your question you could have an average of 2 cars per person in this situation. Suppose that at an average of 1 week/month each car will need to be rented at an average of $35/month for 30 days. Assume that this is equal to the cost of a new car. The total rental price for 30 day rentals for one car is $2,400. The total cost for 30 days ($2,400) divided by the average of 1 week rental per car ($35/ month and $35/ rental = $1,200) is $150. This is the cost of a new rental car + depreciation. The average price of a car is $6,800. So that price is a fair estimate of the total cost of renting only one car. So the total rental cost minus depreciation is $900. So the net cost of renting one car for 30 days is $1,700. The total cost divided by 30 days is $150. Therefore, the total cost for renting one car for 90 days is", "answer": "E: ticket"}

He sends Bob via a conveyor belt to a holding pool where he is fed, clean-lined, and released.  He returns to the trap hole and catches another 12-foot alligator. Bob is then released to the lake.  This time he breaks loose and swam a few hundred yards to the shore and returned to the reservoir.  He is now 16 feet long with a snout that protrudes up to 3 feet above water.  He was caught in the trap while the trap was in motion. The trapper does not want Bob to escape and end up in the next lake nearby.  In his haste to capture Bob, he accidentally traps 8 more of those gigantic boogers, so he starts hauling them out of the pond through the conveyor belt.  At the end of the conveyor belt, all 16 feet of alligator are hauled out.  The trapper can\u2019t seem to find a way to get the last 8-foot-long booger back out of the pond.  He asks one of the employees to take a bucket of water and lift out the 8-foot-long thing, which is all that is left of the 12-foot-long gator. All the while, he\u2019s trying to collect himself. When he finds Bob, he thinks about the eight-foot alligator that bobbed up out of the water.  He sees what is left of that other eight-foot-long gasser. Just then, the man who was handling the water bucket walks out onto the conveyor belt and recognizes the last-eight-foot-long all-igator", "answer": "E: expensive"}
{"text": "Where could a printer be used only by a group of 4 or more people where one person reads, writes, and prints?\nInput:A car rental agency is considering a new, more expensive car that requires more staff.  The average rental car rental for a couple of weeks is about $80.\nWhat does that cost per car day for staff?  How much would it cost if the rental cost increased every time the number of employees increased?  The average daily cost for a hotel room is between $150 and $200 per night.  How is this different?  Would a hotel charge staff as much if they had to rent 2 cars a day?\nAnswer: The hotel would provide the space for the printer but would not have to pay for drivers, storage, etc. If the daily car rental cost for a new car that required more staff increased from $80 to $200, then the hotel would have to provide that extra car for each additional employee (a total of 12 employees) for each day the new car cost $200.\nSolution:\n$800 * 13 = $20,800 / 120 = $854 * 120 = $13,600 per day.\nThis means that only 52 cars would have to be purchased (each costing $854) to meet the weekly rental car needs of 24 employees.\nIf the increase in staff requirement is 1,200% than the initial purchase costs would have to drop from $854 per car to $988 per car.\nSolution :\n52 cars * 24 x $854 = $2,622,000\n52 cars * 24*$854 = $4,966.00\nThe daily cost to staff 24 cars would, therefore, total $3,648,000\nSub(2,666) / 24 = $21,849\nSub(2,300) / 24 = $30,742\nSub(2,600) / 24 = $47,920\nAdd $21,849 to $4,966 and get $9,979\nThis means that the total cost for the 24 cars is $37,829.00\nSub(2) / $25,000 = $3,812,000\nSub(3) / $4,966 = $6,547,000\nSub(4) / $6,547 = $9,979,000\nSub(5) / $9,999 = $", "answer": "A: school"}

They arrive at the farm at 5PM, and the grandmother tells the son that he is almost ready to go. As the child exits the car, the wind is howling, strong gusts have swept the branches of nearby trees, and the ground is shaking. When he reaches the car, they are so nervous they hesitate for a moment before pressing the button to start the car. In the car, the toddler sits in the back seat wearing shorts and a t-shirt. The parents are sitting in the front seat in sweats and a t-shirt, having just arrived minutes earlier. As they continue to drive in the wind and through the trees, they cannot see ahead without fear of becoming disoriented or stranded. Finally, all of a sudden, a sudden gust of wind rips the car topsy-turvy. In the back of the wind-chimped car, the mother and toddler cry as they experience the first sensation of vertigo and nausea that many of us become unable to deal with in this environment. The mother, terrified, tries to pull over at the only farmhouse on the property, but finds that she cannot drive on the slippery driveway or the high-horsepower tractor that belongs to the grandparents, which has no brakes. She tries pulling off the street near the only farmhouse on an isolated, one-lane road without being able to steer the car. At a near-stop, the mother pulls over, and throws the toddler and grandparents into the back seat of the car and pulls the car over. Both the mother and grandson have faint but intense trembling, and begin trying to call for help on their cellphones. The grandfather, overwhelmed and scared to death, is about to dial 911, when the mother reminds him that she should call first, and then waits to get out of the vehicle while the grandparents call the police through their cellphones. The two then call 911, and a police SUV arrives. The parents enter the SUV, the child takes off", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}

She plans to put him on a farm, where he can grow corn. It takes her 40 days from the time the child is taken from her care to the time the child is grown enough to harvest corn. He will turn 22 in 10 years. How many miles can he walk on a good day? It will take 20 miles per person.\nOutput: 10 x 20 = 400 miles.\nFor a two person family, this would mean a 20 mile round trip each day. So he would be able to go 200 miles per day, but he wouldn't be able to do it all at once, because of time constraints and other reasons. So if he is walking 20 miles per day (one mile per foot), then he will need to cover a mile each day which will total 80 miles per day. He will need to walk the 40 miles in 20 days, so he will need to walk the 320 miles per month, therefore covering the distance he walked in the 20 days. So, he will end his time on the farm about one year from the time he left it. What will he do?\nOutput: What would he expect?\nOutput: Will you want your son to see him when he leaves?\nOutput: How long from the time he left, will he want to see him?\nOutput: What will he tell him?\nOutput: How is this different from working with concrete?", "answer": "A: blisters"}

His property is located in a flood plain. He has a number of field irrigation facilities installed and maintained.  A river runs from his property in a southeasterly direction down the center of the state. The river flows inland and then flows north in a generally east to west direction.\nThe farmer lives about 1.5 miles wide from the river. His house is about 9.5 feet high and 40 feet long. The river is approximately 3.5 feet wide. The river banks rise up to a maximum length of 0.5 miles.  If the river was to rise up to the level at which the house is located 1 mile from the river, his field irrigation facility would be damaged.\nThe river is at a level of 11.7 feet. The average river level is about 9.5 ft.\nThe river flow in its natural course is about 9,000 gallons per day at the upstream end of the river and about 6,000 gallons per day downstream from the upstream end of the landowner.\nThe river is 10% under its normal flow level.\nThe river is currently operating at 60% of its normal flow level.

The river will normally operate at about 20% of its normal speed if the minimum inflow increases from 60% down to 45%.\nA flow rate meter measures the flow rate of the river.  This flow rate is only an estimate of the river's true flow rate.

{"text": "a: Confusion: 1/20 b: Problems: 10/250 c: Riot: 15/700 d: Arrest: 10/25 e: Protest: 10/6\nSo 10/250, 50/400, 100/1000 for civil action. Total for civil action is 100*1=<<100*1=200>>200.\nTherefore civil action is 20 times greater than the amount represented by that figure - total social and economic costs will be >1,000 times greater than that represented by the figure.\nFor example, the 1,000 individuals making a noise complaint to the police department, will also have 100 members of their community making noise complaints to the police. The police department will respond to all such complaints. The police chief may impose a fine on at least 7 of those 100 people since he can determine that at least 70 of them have violated local noise ordinances. Thus the total cost to be avoided by the city and its people is >200 or 2/3rds of a million dollars. If you want to estimate the social cost to be avoided your estimate should include all those 100 people and not just the individuals who make noise complaints. Total social, economic costs would be over a million per family.\nTo estimate the legal costs of all those lawsuits and the administrative costs of all those suits and lawsuits, you should assume that in the process of the suit, the government loses the civil lawsuit and the cases are settled at the court. This will happen as is usually the case. The courts do not do the government's bidding. There will be lots and lots of court cases as a result of all that noise. This will take up lots of legal time and legal fees. These costs have to be included in the estimate of the economic costs described above.\nThese 100 people make up 20% of the population and make up most of the social costs involved in resolving the noise complaints. You can choose to omit some or all of their numbers in your figures.\n\nInput: A couple is looking for a way to reduce the cost of a college student's tuition payment.

What is the percentage success rate of completing and maintaining a 50-day plan?\nOutput: 100% success will restore 100%. 50% will restore 50%.\nTherefore 60% of the time spent on the 50-day plan will restore 20% less happiness than when using only a 40-day plan.\nThus, 60% of total time spent on each 50-day plan will not restore happiness.\nSince success does not equal happiness, all 50-day plan will result in less happiness for every 1 day lost.\nThus 60% of time spent on each 50 day plan will not restore any happiness.\nSo, 60% of total 50-day plan, would result in less happiness than using only 40-days time.\nTherefore, 60% of total 40-day plan, would total less happiness than using only 22-days time.\nThus, 60 % of total 22-day plan, would not be enough to result in the 50-day plan succeeding.\n\nInput: I am given a set of three balls in the air: one on top of a box, one on top of the base of the box, and one on top of the back of a chair.

Put $1000 in an SEP plan C.  Put in a Roth IRA D.  None of the above E. All of the above\nOutput: It will take 5 months for the $1000 plan and 2 months for the SEP plan to pay in $1,000 and $1,500, respectively. The other accounts will pay in $125 and $1250, respectively. The $3,750, or $12,500 for the Roth IRA, will take 6 months. The $5,875, or $19,250 for the SEP will take 7 months. Thus, the max amount will be $9,950. And since a $1000 plan is only $1000 and a $1,500 plan is only $5,500, the max would be only $6,900. And since none of these plans is really maxing out anyone's money, the max will be only $4,800. And since none of them is maxing out my money, the max will still be only $3,775. And since none of this really counts against me in the tax code, the max will be $3,775.\nOutput: The maximum is $25\nOutput: The max is $100\nOutput: The max will be $25\nOutput: If this money is maxed out, then the max in the other accounts will be only $225\nOutput: $5,855 maximum\n\nInput:An airplane flies over Niagara Falls.

{"text": "The smart phone and a wristwatch are on the top of the list.\nA tiny calculator would be one of the most visible on the mobile phone and wristwatch as they would be the most mobile.\n\nInput: Nowadays, the fastest and most popular method of traveling is by automobile. Most people live in areas where there is either no highway to drive down or very limited access at best. Those few cities that do have highways usually have traffic lights and traffic laws. There are also other traffic alternatives like taxis or limousines that are expensive and can't always take you where you are going.\nIn the past, getting from one destination to another only required walking. You would walk from your home to the post office or from the post office to your local grocery store or store or bank and then from the supermarket or bank to your home. But since walking is not very safe, the walking routes have changed quite a bit as well, with bicycle paths, skateboard parks and pedestrian bridges connecting major urban centers together.\nTherefore you have a much more convenient type of travel now than you did when you were young; cars are your mode of transportation, and the walkers, runners, bicyclists and people in wheelchairs are now using your highways as their own.\nIn this world, there are plenty of places that people would not want to walk at all, where it may not be safe to walk alone. Therefore most people prefer to rent a car and avoid walking at all costs. Even places like Hawaii or Singapore don't allow people to walk alone in their own neighborhood, even if a place has a safe pedestrian crosswalk to the road that they can use.\nSo now you have a problem when you want to go outside: where you walk to work, to the market, to your doctor in the local hospital, to the pharmacy, or to the bank? Is walking safe and convenient for these places that you usually go to?\nThe answer to this question is, of course, a simple yes if you have the right mode of transportation for your trips. People can use wheelchairs or electric scooters and motorized carts to their ability to get around safely. People can also use hand-held canes, walkers, walkers with handrails, crutches or canes with wheels.\nMost people in wheelchairs don't drive, and even fewer people use electric scooters at walking speeds. People with wheelchairs, crutches, walkers and people in wheelchairs do not use their wheels", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

An ordinary telephone card held two telephone numbers. However, in the late 1950's, the practice of \"dial up\" was replaced by the \"digital telephony\" telephone system, which uses an electronic transmission system to transfer data over the Internet.\nA digital phone card holds a digitizing device with an electronic interface. The digitizing device uses a digital computer, which calculates the location of each data packet to and from the Internet data network.\nThe digitizing device holds a transmitter and a receiver, which transmit and receive voice data. In one embodiment, an Internet data connection permits the transmitter to transmit voice data with a telephone card. The telephone card also permits the telephone line connection.\nThe digitizing cable, which transfers digitized voice data and data packets, connects the telephone card to a modem at the end of the call. From the modem, the digital calls are transferred through the Internet.\nThe digitizing and data transmissions of the telephone call are made on an \"Internet Protocol\" (\"IP\") network, which uses a digital telephone line. The data packets are transferred by the same network using the same network protocol.\n\nInput: A bank, with a total deposits of $9 million, announces that there will be no interest paid on any outstanding bank deposits as of January 1, 1992.

Each interview takes 20 minutes of conversation and two minutes of listening time to be sure the sales representatives are getting the information they want or need. Each response is scored by each sales representative. When the score is 15 out of twenty-five, the response rate for the interview gets too high, and the interview is postponed. If the score is 40 out of fifty-five, responses are discounted to give respondents an incentive to keep their score high. A score of 50% or less on the interview is interpreted as a negative response, and the interview is cancelled.\nConsequently, for each 10% increase in the response rate, five additional interviews will be scheduled. At a rate of 5 minutes a person, that means the response rate must be reduced by 10% in total - an interview scheduled for 10 minutes will be scheduled for 15 minutes. The last two interviews will then be scheduled for 30 minutes in total, and the response rate will be 20 out of 25. So for 10% of the interviews, a response rate of 10% is to be expected.\nThen the total response rate can be used to determine an average score for each interview based on the response rate for each participant.\nFor 100 participants, the total response rate of 10% would be = 10^(10x+1/2)\n= 10^(10x)/4 + 4\n= = 0.5X\n= 0.5X + 5\nThat leaves 5 times the response rate of 20% required to reach a response rating of 50%.\nFor 50% of interviews, the total response rate is = 5^(50/25)/22 + 22\n= = 0.03X\n= 0.03X + 5\nAs a result, the response rate for 50% interviews with 20 out of 25 response rates of 40% requires 45 minutes of total listening time. It takes 100 minutes to get into each interview mode.\n\nInput: A person decides to renovate every room on his", "answer": "C: shop"}

When you come into a room and there is a woman standing right in front of you, what is the fastest way you can run away?\n\nInput:The number of players in the field is 6 and the number of pitches in the game is 10. In each inning there is a 30 second stoppage to change pitchers. The number of outs is 10 and the number of outs by the pitcher is 9.\n\nOutput:Each time a pitcher goes out the batter makes their way to a base position where they may or may not attempt to score a run, depending on the batter's batting practice technique. This is a long, drawn out game and has many ways to change and affect the outcome of the game. The batter should be ready to strike out at all times. Every pitch counts and it is very necessary for the batter to strike out all three times throughout a game. The batter will be called out after 9 outs and may be in the field and still steal a base as many times as necessary. The next time a batter hits balls to a non-base hit location the batter must wait ten seconds as the pitcher comes back out from the time it was called out. After one of the pitchers finishes his inning, he must immediately go back in time. The pitcher can also call the batter back out to the mound if he has to stop himself.\n\nInput:Three golfers are out on the 18th hole.

Which one is taller? Choose an answer.\nOutput: All trees grow at equal potential.\nOne tree has equal potential for water, but the other tree has equal potential for wind.\nThese two trees have equal potential, but since this tree is older, it has a higher potential for water.\nBecause this tree has a higher potential for wind, it will grow quicker and its potential for water will decrease.\nThis tree will grow slower than the other tree, but because the other tree has a lower potential for water, that means the other tree will also grow slower.\nSo even though the older tree has a smaller potential for water, it will probably not grow as fast.\nTherefore, the longer the tree grows, the slower it will grow; and the shorter the tree, the faster it grows.\nSo, in a nutshell, all trees grow equal to their potential, but faster trees grow slightly ahead of the slowest trees, and trees that are slower grow slightly behind slow ones.\nSo, in summary, in this case, because the older tree has a higher potential, it will grow faster than the other tree.\nBut in all cases, it's the amount of time that each tree has that determines the growth.\nSo, in all cases, the younger tree will grow slightly faster than the older tree, but because the older tree has equal potential for both wind and water, it will only grow faster when it has more time to grow.\nSo the final correct answer to this question is YES!\n\nInput: A farmer wants to know how long it will take for a certain amount of potatoes to grow.

{"text": "The cabin is used primarily as a sleeping area, but it also serves as a drinking water container and as a dining and reading area. The cabin is located at 60,000 feet, which is the altitude of the jet engine.\nEach person sleeps four to a cot. Each of the four cots, when not in use, is a comfortable size for a 1 to 3 year old. Each cot holds about 15 ounces and is attached to the cabin door with an aluminum bar.\nThe cabin also serves as a restroom and a sleeping place for the pilot and cabin crew.\nThe cabin and its amenities cost approximately $50,000.

The airplane had to be equipped with air conditioning due to the tropical climate. What was the best/most cost-effective way of installing the air conditioning to preserve the airplane's interior temperature?  Output: To minimize the number of required fans, all the interior surfaces (e.g., glass, leather, carpet) must be cleaned before installing air conditioning. An air conditioner will be installed near the cockpit which will be used on takeoff and landing to make it easier to cool the cabin. The only available area of the interior to install the air conditioner was the lavatory. Therefore, the only option was to install a hot air system which could only be used when the airplane was in flight. The total cost was estimated to be $250,000.00 and would be spread over two deliveries.\nOutput: The airplane cost less to make with the air conditioning installed than to buy without the air conditioning.

There are a lot of ways, and the first one is not true. 80/60 would mean that the person on the highway is expected to travel 80 miles per hour while passing other vehicles. Since there is no way for someone to reach 80 miles per hour, the best thing is for them to stay the speed limit and not go any faster than their safe limit. (80/60 also doesn't make sense in your answer. If the person has to be 80/60, it means that their maximum speed is 80%. If that is the case, they would need to travel 30 miles per hour in order to reach their destination. If the limit for the specific highways is 80 MPH, then they need to travel 30 MPH, since 80 MPH is not 80% of 80, so they would need to travel 2 MPH to get to their destination.)\n\n2.

If you have to choose a number on the scale of 10-20, the answer depends on several factors.\nThe first factor is that you have time and the other factors are not relevant.  There is a good chance that if there is a meeting that will involve a lot of people the number of persons in the room will be low.\nWhen in a room of 25 persons or more, it is important to keep the number of people lower.  If there are two people in a room of 25 and two people in a room above and two people in a bedroom the likelihood is too high for the room to be filled.\nOn a similar note, when there are fewer people you must use a more efficient meeting space.

Choice:\nOutput: What happens to the other people?\nThe rules of chess were very similar to the rules of card games.  The two opponents were sitting on opposite sides of the board.  In order to play, it is necessary to pass your turn to the player you are trying to play against.  Thus, sitting on your right or your left sides means that you are passing your turn to the opponent sitting on your right or right side.\nA new game will be started when somebody takes control of your turn.\nNote: Since the number of people in a room is limited most chess players prefer to play cards as a game.  They are more cooperative and you do not have to wait as long for your turn.  Playing cards allows the use of dice.  Using dice for playing chess also allows for greater opportunities for strategy.

You try to navigate through the traffic, but your headlights indicate that there is no place to go.  You drive to the parking lot at the service center and try to park there.  However, the lot is too far away, and there is no street parking nearby.  You try to find space in a nearby building, but to do this, you must park in front of the shop, which would require being visible to anyone in the shop.  In fact, your headlights are too dark for the shop employees to see you as you park in front of them.  Can you find an alternative way to park?  Your answer will be in the negative.  Why?\nInput:- There are many factors involved in how people move, as stated by Albert Einstein on June 27th, 1905.  Some factors are: the cost, time, distance, cost, efficiency, and convenience.  These factors and others factor into the choice of where to park.  Therefore, your answer will be in the positive, except for one factor - the distance to your destination.  This is a good factor to include though, in your answer.  For your example, you might say that your destination is 45 minutes away by car, so 45 minutes of driving in the direction of your destination will result in 2 hours 15 minutes of time spent in traffic.  But if your destination is 45 minutes by car, then 15 hours 5 minutes driving time will result in 45 minutes of time spent in the traffic.  In sum, the longer you drive, the more time you will spend in the traffic.  Thus, you can expect your answer to include the distance to your destination in your answer.\nInput:- To avoid damage to a car's wheels, would be be more likely to get a tire replaced before replacing the car.

A baker needs to sell 12,000 kilos in a week. What is the average cost to produce 1,000 of the 10 most popular breads?\nOutput:Bread and butter can be divided up into many different categories and it is helpful to know which of these categories the bakery is selling specifically.  For example, if the bakery is selling white wheat bread from a bread pan on sale at $3.00, the total cost to produce a single loaf would be $200.  The cost to sell the bread pan alone would be another $100.  This would then leave $240 for the bread itself.\n\nOutput: In order to determine the type of product sold, it is necessary to know the total amount of sales the bakery has made in a particular week.  Calculating this number requires looking at each type of product the bakery sells.  For example, an oven-ready oven-proof pan sells for $15.  Calculating the sales total of all 10 baking pans in the baking sales total $60,000.  So the total sales amount in the weekly period is $6,000.  A baker needs a total of 40 baking pans for a week.  Given that the baker needs 40 baking pans in a week, the cost of all 10 different pans would be $600.  Thus it would be necessary for the baker to buy 40 pans in the first week in order to make 4 weekly sales.  After the first week, the baker will need to sell 1,000 different pans in order to make 4 total sales.\n\nInput: How many cups of coffee would a single serving of java require if the cup was made from 100% raw material?\nOutput: When making a cup of coffee, it is usually necessary to prepare the grounds in a different way in order to make a cup of coffee that will be more than 90% cup", "answer": "D: closet"}

It is known as a \"crystal light fixture\".  What is its exact history?\nOutput: It is not uncommon that \"crystal light fixtures\" resemble something made in the  1930's and on up.  A more likely explanation is that this type of fixture was made to be similar to, but be similar to, a \"crystal light bulb\".  Crystal light fixtures of this period usually used a small round, parabolic reflector to reflect a light beam that was created by a hot filament with a special, heat-resistant bulb inside.\nOutput: The average white to red light output from a typical \"crystal light fixture\" is 80 lumens per watt.  The average output from the type of bulb most often used in a \"crystal light socket\" is 100 lumens per watt.\nOutput: The current \"crystal light fixture\", as a \"crystal bulb\", was produced in 1946.  Although the fixture that it resembles may be older, \"crystal light\" lamps generally are older.  \"A crystal light fixture\" is most often referred to in the U.S. today as a \"crystal lamp\" but it is much more accurately referred to as a \"crystal fixture\".\nOutput: The average output from \"crystal light fixtures\", such as that in the photo, varies according to the manufacturer, style, and size of the bulb used to make the fixture.

You immediately pull over to check the license plate because you recognize it. (You've visited and photographed this tourist attraction before.) The license plate is a \u201cFlorida\u201d plate with an arrow through the middle, and the car's name is \"Florida\" and on its rear seat rests a \u201cFlorida\u2019s Flag\u201d flag. The car also has \u201cFlorida\u2019\" license plates on its back seat and is fitted with the \u201cFlorida State Flag\u201d bumper sticker. The name, \u201cMark\u201d on the license plate, matches the description under your passenger's seat. The driver and passenger are clearly white males. You are not suspicious because they appear to be happy and carefree. What do you think would be the most likely explanation for this situation? Is it a possible coincidence? An unlikely coincidence? A true coincidence?\nOutput: This is an unlikely coincidence.\nYour friend had visited the tourist attraction before in an East Coast state.

The man and woman look exactly like you and your friend saw them, and your friend\u2019s location indicates that they would be happy and carefree just like you describe them. The location of the state where the car is registered indicates that it is located in the state where your friend will stay after visiting the tourist attraction. The presence of \u201cthe two boys\u201d and the car\u2019s \u201cFlorida\u201d license plate is consistent with the description of the car your friend had seen on previous visits and with the descriptions of the license plates you saw on the \u201cFlorida\u201d plates in this car you have just seen. If this car wasn\u2019t the one you had seen before, would you now say it was something unusual?\nResponse: If this is an unlikely event, what evidence do you perceive for this unlikely event?

The temperature difference between earth's surface and atmosphere does not equal a vacuum, if this were the case the pressure above the surface would also be equal to the pressure above the atmosphere.  The pressure difference would then act like a valve and keep out moisture from the air.  If one of the atmospheric conditions had water vapor in it when the pressure difference was smaller it would increase when the pressure difference became larger.  In order to get a vacuum, the pressure must be greater than the surface pressure.  In water vapor, the pressure difference is greater than the surface pressure, so the vacuum isn't created.\nOutput: In order to create a vacuum, the atmospheric pressure must be greater than that of the surface.\n\nInput:If you have 5 seconds to figure out how to spell a word, which of the following words does not start with the letter \"U\"?

If so, then how much of the air in the bag is warmed by radiation (heat)?\nOutput: A 1W lamp emits radiation at a wavelength of \u03bb=2.15cm. At this wavelength the light intensity is 10W/m-2. The light is also absorbed by some substances that reduce the infrared light to near infrared. The radiation intensity in the open air is 5W/m2. Because of this 10W/m2 is more than 5W/m2 in the plastic bag. This amounts to a decrease in the infrared radiation by 15%. The light that passes through the bag is thus reduced by 15% to 2.15W/m2. Consequently the open bag has greater temperature than the closed plastic bag.\nInput: Two different people have the same number of body cells.

A typical day's flight has 100-150 passengers. In order to cover these flights, most of the airline's planes would be in the air simultaneously. If each plane could carry 2 people on board, this means that the number of passengers on one plane at one time would be approximately 2000. But what if the airlines decided to take extra seats on certain days to accommodate more travelers? Since airplanes are much bigger than most people realize, the plane with the extra seats would not be nearly as heavy as we might expect. So the airplane with the extra seats would weigh approximately 30,000-40,000 pounds. A typical passenger would need to make 4 trips, on each plane, to make it worthwhile to use the extra seats. Therefore, one passenger on the plane would not be able to sit on her own and could not be on the plane twice. Where would a passenger like this be carried?

Its incubation period is 5 days\ne. Chicken manure is sterile\n\n2.) A chicken lays its eggs on the first day of spring. In late March, as summer approaches, the male chicks of the hen begin to stand out in the open by laying their eggs in trees in front of the home. A female chicken is now out hunting for the male. On a sunny day in April, when the weather is warm, a female chicken in her breeding territory lays an egg when a male arrives wearing the characteristic blue comb that indicates a male. The egg is fertile. On a cold day a male will not come close to laying an egg. At the end of May, the male chicks leave the breeding territory for the open. The breeding season is over and the female chickens go to their nests where they lay their eggs. On the next spring\u2019s sunny day, a female chicken in the nest will lay her egg. This time the egg is fertile. The egg is fertile because of its incubation period of 5 days, but also by the fact that chicken manure is sterile. Thus, the egg, when laid, cannot be fertilized.\n\n3.) The male chickens of the hen are on this day being taught how to cross a road. The male chickens are given names and numbers by their father. This day they have to cross a small road with a fence with a guard on top. A male chicken is the most dangerous to cross this road because he cannot see his object of mating.

Output: Is possible.  The rental charge is $30 per day for two cars and $190 per day for one car. The total cost is $40.\nOutput: The difference in the amount is $3.\nThe answer is $9.\nNOTE: The rent is $180.  The car rent is $30/day.  Since the car is required as a condition of being allowed on the rental, it is paid and the difference between the total charge and the total rent must be deducted.  The total rental charge is $180.\nThe total rental charge divided by the total amount paid for the two cars is:\n$180 / 2 = $18.75\nThe total rental charge multiplied by the number of days the car-rental company will rent you is:\n$180 divided by $180 = $1.50\nThus, the total rental charge divided by that number of days is $10.50 (2 x 18.75) which is the difference between the rental charge and the total rent, $10.50.\nThe total rental line is then subtracted from the total car-rental cost to yield the result:\n $10.50/(=30+20+1) = $9.75\nNow you can subtract the new difference from the car-rental charges so that $9.75 is added to the rental cost.\n\nInput:The truck driver leaves a little after 8:00 PM.

After calculating the height of the existing wall, and measuring the distance of the wall from the bottom of the new base he calculated that he could build an additional 5 cm to the new floor. However, he found that this is too high as it would give him a height measurement. So he did a rough cut in a rough piece and a full cut in the foundation piece to be sure this was correct.

{"text": "The total cost of moving a single car according to a list of requirements is $10.00 per mile.  One car with a cost of $10 will take 1367 miles to move (one mile equals to 200 miles, so 1 mile takes 1367 miles, for a total of 1367 miles).  When the total cost of the moving cost is taken into account, an additional 20% increase is needed to get any car out of one state to another state.  This is equal to an increase in cost of moving from California to Texas.\n\nInput:How many men would be needed to move a single car from California to Texas if it had wheels instead of tires?\nOutput: A minimum of one man would be needed per state plus one extra man in California.  Therefore, the cost per man would be calculated as 1-<<1-<<20>>20.\nNow multiply that by the number of cars (20) in the car rental agency.  Divide the total cost by 15 (which equals 300 miles) and you have 657,941,800 miles!\nNow take the 300 miles the car rental agency takes to transfer one car from its home to its new location in Texas.  Since they charge $30/day for that rental, and the total cost of moving the car (10,000 miles, one car) to Texas is $10.00, the total cost of moving one car for 1367 miles in 1367 miles is $10,000 times $30/day.  That is $34,667,667.\nNow take the total cost of moving a car from California (10,000 miles) to Texas (1367 miles) and deduct the $30/day they charge.  Add the $34,667,737 into your total of $24,668,666, and you have $15,000,000,000, and the total cost to move one car $15 million.\nNow divide the total amount in your calculator by 1.5.  That is $15 million times 1.5 equals $15,000, which is also the cost of moving one car.\nAnd then divide the amount in your calculator by 17, and you have $9.56 million.  Thus, the total amount in your calculus calculator is $9.56 million, which comes to $9.56 per car.

Great-granddad had invited the family (A) to his gathering.\n\nInput:What is the cost of an individual car ride that lasts one hour?\nOutput:The cost of any \"one hour\" trip using one car/person is $0.50.\nThis implies that if three individuals in a car travel at the maximum speed (35 mph) for one hour each at $0.50 per hour, then the total cost of a family transportation trip with car is $40 for three people in a car at 35 mph.\nThe cost of using two cars is $1.50 per hour or $2.50 per person.  This means that the cost of three persons in a car traveling one hour at 35 mph in two cars is $3.50 per person.\nThe total cost of a family trip with car and two people in a car traveling one-hour is $12.50 (3/2)*2=<<12.50=10>>7, i.e., $9 per individual and $4.50 per car (including fuel).  This is a total cost of $22 before insurance and gasoline.\n\nInput:The price a local grocery store charges for an individual item is $1.00.  The average price of a gallon of gasoline for a car is $0.59; therefore, the gasoline price per gallon of gas on the local grocery store will be $59.00/GALLON.  How much will the grocery store charge for an individual item, if one gallon of gasoline is $59.00?\nOutput:The average gas price per gallon of gasoline on the local grocery store, if no gasoline were used, will be $0.35 due to its location less the $1.00/GALLONE (1 gallon of gasoline) per person price charged by the grocery store.\nTherefore, the local grocery store will charge $0.35 for an $1.00 retail grocery item.\nSo, the retail grocery item (G) will be $0.", "answer": "C: brother's house"}

The land is paid for in cash but there is no water on the land.  His only water supply is a dam that runs on the same river that supplies other farms in the small town of town.  The water from the dam is filtered, treated, bottled and sold.  The dam and stream supply all of the drinking water in towns throughout the county.  This farmer leases water from the village of town every other year to irrigate his crops.  According to the village administrator, there are 10,000 persons in this area who would sell their homes for $2,000 each year for 5 years.  The price of water is $700 per acre foot (350,000 feet of water) so the value of his land must be approximately $750,000.  The total of the land payments will pay his family $10,000 per year and would be equal of 200 years of payments over the course of 5 years.  The farmer also receives a tax break of $300 on this money.  How much per year will he receive?\nOutput:\nThe total amount of land payments would be $14,000, or $750,000 for 5 years.  So he would receive $3,200 per year.  Based on the value of the water supply, the village was able to put down a $300,000 loan on the land.  As a result, he would receive only $5,100 per year.\n$15,000 $750,000\n5x 200\n1 =\nThus, the total is $15", "answer": "B: magazines"}

Later, after the two men have been talking for some time and eating lunch at a local restaurant without any help from the policeman, the man asks the policeman if he will show it to him now, since he really wants to see it.

The family must take the horses with them; they will need them to help them move to higher ground.  What precautions should be taken if the family chooses to leave the horses at the house with their owners?\nOutput:1) There is a car rental facility in a city three miles from the family home, but it charges $30/day, and the family intends to stay in the house during the warning.

The total weight was 544 pounds.\nThus the final answer is 987\n\nInput: If the total wind speed is 100 mph, how much force would it take to push a 2 ton car across the country at that speed?  Output: 100 mph is the force needed to push a 2 ton vehicle across the country at 100 mph.\nThe force needed to push a car across country at 100 mph is 3 times the force needed to push it at 20 mph.\nThe force will be about a pound.\nFor purposes of measuring force (1/r), then the force needed to push the car across country at 100mph is\n100 = 100/r * 2\n0.2989 = 2 = 4.073\n(2*3)*4 = 1.921\nTherefore, 100 mph is the force necessary to push a 2 ton truck carrying a 2 ton car across country at 100 miles per hour, or, for those who do not know, 100 mph = 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1/r.\n\nInput: Let a truck carrying four 100-pound boxes cross the country at 100 miles/hour with a wind speed of 90mph.\nThe speed of the wind is 80mph. If we apply a constant speed force of 1 pound of force to the four 100-pound boxes at a speed of 60mph, how much force can the force of that 1 pound of force impart on a 2 ton truck pulling a 200-pound box?\nOutput: The force of 1 pound of constant force on the four 100-pound bags results in a total force of 1 pound.\nThus, the force of 1 pound of the constant force is 4 pounds.\nSo the force of 1 pound at 60mph adds up to 4 pounds, which is 8.3 pounds.\nSo the final force of 4 pounds equals 8.3 pounds and the 100-mile-per-hour wind speed equals 9 mph, in other words 2 = 3.5 x 3 x 2.2 = 5% or 7-8% at 90 mph. The total force of 5 pounds is 6 pounds, equivalent to 100", "answer": "C: torso"}

Each day, a woman would order two cups of coffee, 4.25 cans of soda, and 12 cigars.  After two weeks, the barman noticed that his sales had dropped.  The barman attributed the decline largely to the prices he was charging.  He began charging the same price after two more weeks. Before long, his sales increased. How much were they purchasing during these two weeks?\nWhy may this have happened?

{"text": "Fear is the strongest emotion known to man, which allows you to run faster than a shark but slower than a duck.\nSince your fear is strong enough to cause your heart to race at 100 beats a minute, you must be capable of exertion.\nThe fastest way for you to exert yourself is for you to swim towards the beach, while avoiding the sharks that are in the water.  The sharks are also capable of swimming extremely fast, so swimming against them is not an effective plan.  If you are the swim king of your ocean, people will notice your strength, and you will be the target of much harassment from others.\nThe second method is much simpler: you will have no fear.  Because you are aware that you are surrounded and there is a possibility that someone could be behind you, you will instinctively move out of the way. If you cannot resist the urge to dash away, then you will run. If you are constantly swimming and trying to evade danger (without fear), you will be in constant danger.  Finally, if you are an animal, you will not be able to move at all due to your fear.  You will become one with the sea as soon as you are submerged.  The only way you will survive is if you are willing to abandon your fear.\nIt takes 3 hours to get from your starting location to your destination.

They are paid $500 each. 2 employees work 1 hour and 30 minutes in a company store, the 2 remaining employees work the rest 1 hour and 20 minutes. Employees are paid $350/day for working 1 hour and 30 minutes. A week later, the new employees will be paid $300/day for working the same amount of time in the store working an additional hour and 30 minutes. If the number of employees doubles, the total daily per employee earnings increase to $500. The total per hour earnings increase to $300 if the number of employees halves. The per hour earnings increase to 50 if the number of employees quadruples. On the day a product is sold, there are 15 customers in the store paying $10 each. So the total per hour earnings increase is $20 for the 5 employees working 10 more hours in the store each day ($25/hour each). The total per hour earnings for each store employee, as a group, during the first week increase to $300/hour ($550/week).\nInput: A business gives you a coupon entitling you to 70% off a product.

You spend 12 hours shopping in the store, bringing the total per hour earnings to $50. Since the coupons have been reduced from $100/hour down to $25/hour, you make $50 off the $500 you spent. Would you say spending $50/week, or the equivalent of each employee in your company, is the correct amount of time spent in each store?\nOutput: Spending", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}
{"text": "What happens in the Bible is that man comes to be saved. The Bible says, \"Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Therefore be careful\" (Mark 16:17, The Message).  And if you are one of the faithful, then you know that you are saved. So this is it. When it comes to personal salvation, we as Christians are called to do more than believe what we believe. We are being held accountable for what we do in God's sight, for Christ's sake. Thus, Christians are expected to act out our faith as much as possible in social interaction. Thus, Christian interaction on a daily basis involves giving of ourselves to all people, and especially to our neighbours. So, when you see a family or friend of yours struggling to make it on their own, that is a Christian giving of ourselves for them. So what is it?\n\nInput:The person has $1 million, and will need to save $200,000 more over the next year. At the same time, he has to purchase a new car. What is the ideal car and price range to get? Output: This is the vehicle everyone should have to purchase the car of theirs dreams and a lifestyle they can provide themselves. The person should purchase this automobile, and they should do so for under $20,000. If he can get a loan for the remaining $60,000, the car price can be decreased by another $20,000 by paying for only 10% of the automobile's value over the life of the loan.\nThe price of this automobile (for 10% down payment) would be $11,290,000. So total loan cost from car loan would be $11,090,000 * $20,000 * 10% = $50,000. This amount could be put towards down payment of new car and $20,000 to avoid being in debt for the next 10 years while saving money.\n\nInput:There is a big party coming up, and it would cost $250,000 to have the big party.

In this protected room, any food that is stored can be stored safely.  But pizza and pizza oven ovens cannot be stored in a room that is filled with moist air.  It would be a perfect environment for mold and mildew to grow.\nOutput: C.  You can keep food items for a short period of time in a room that is sealed that is only warm air and moisture is allowed to enter the room.  The food will not rot, because it is protected from the weather.  It also stays fresh for longer than just a few days.  If the food is stored for more than a few days, humidity could cause the food to spoil unless placed in a plastic container.  However, a freezer refrigerator box is too cumbersome to store food items that are stored for more than a couple of days.  And it is possible, for small food items that need only a couple of days of storage, there could be problems using a small food container.  If the food goes more than two days, the food may be spoiled.  And, it is also likely for pizza to spoil faster than larger items that might require a day or more of storage.

The wind created enough power for the bus to run for approximately 3 weeks, after which it stopped producing power.(The car parked at the office was equipped with the same type of solar panels.)  How many miles could be saved by simply shutting off the solar panels?  You may be able to save an additional 8 miles per year<n>Output: 5 miles (7,800 kWh) of electricity can be saved with a single solar panel.(The school bus used only 35 kWh of electricity during the two weeks it was parked in the shade.)<n>Output: Using the same method as number 1 above, how much more fuel could be saved after 7 weeks?  Using the method of number 1, how long would be the time to travel from the school in the shade to the site in the shade on the school bus without refueling?(The school bus would travel 11 miles per day to the site on the bus, so 9,500 miles on average.)<n>Output: Taking the difference between number 1 & number 2, how much additional fuel would be saved?<n>Output:Using the method of number 2 (same as number 1), how can one estimate how many miles would be saved as a result of shutting down the solar panel?<n><n>Input:Two weeks after 9/11, a terrorist crashed a plane into a major U.S. commercial airport with the intent to kill all the people on board, but the pilot diverted his plane to instead land at an airport in an industrial area on the coast, to avoid the commercial routes and the casualties that might follow.  The airport manager was aware of this plan and told the pilot that he needed to land at a residential airport if the airport was to function at full capacity.  The pilot told the manager that he would have to pay for his fuel and was unwilling to do that.  How much fuel would be wasted by the airport manager's plan?  You may be interested in the following options: a: using the same system used for your original problem as option 1 (using the same calculation methods and the same assumption of unlimited runway) b: changing option 1 to c above and changing the assumption to b) c: using option 1 as a supplement to option c above and using option c as the first answer)<n>Output: 4,720,000 gallons of fuel would have been

Average annual travel distance from home<n><n>Input:How many days do you expect to spend in Washington, DC? How many days have you already spent in Washington, DC and why?<n>Output:The total number of miles is 15,000. You have traveled 7,000 of those. Assuming that you arrive on Friday of your next visit, your total total number of miles traveled in Washington, DC, is 15,000 - (7,000/5) = 7,000, which is less than 7,000 days. Since your total miles only increased by 7,000 this month, you can count the last three days as your first 100 days and this month as your last 100 days. Your total total number of miles is therefore only 15,000/50 = 9,800.<n>Input:How many nights are you spending at the National Parks? Answer: 10 nights<n>You went to 3 parks, stayed at 3 nights but not 5 nights.  So each night you did not have 2 nights left.  Therefore, you did not complete 5 nights of National Park lodging.  Since you did not continue to camp at the National Parks, you did not complete 100 nights in one place.  This would leave you with 15 days in Washington, DC and 60 days in one park, which you haven't done yet. So each night you stayed at the parks was equivalent to 1 night in Washington, DC.   Each night you did not sleep at the National Parks was equivalent to 1 night of Washington, DC.  Thus, you did not complete 15 nights of one place.<n><n>Input:The local library has a large collection of science journals and books on natural history.

But even so, when you've been married for a year or three years or even ten years, divorce is pretty much inevitable. For what it's worth, I've been married 20 years. When we broke up, it didn't take long at all to get a divorce granted. It's just a matter of finding a judge who's willing. This is not to say that the odds of divorce are 100% but just be prepared to fight for your side of the house. Good luck!<n><n>I've been married for 7 years.

I hope this post sparks some discussion.<n><n>While having lived together for 6 (or 7?) of those 7 years the legal requirements would have been quite high to get a divorce. I can't imagine a judge being willing to take it on unless it was extremely severe. If I read your title correctly, this was either a "relationship status" question on an online quiz or something to that effect. If the answer to the question in question was "married," you would have a very hard time getting divorce. If you answered differently it would have made more sense.<n>Your answer, "we haven't lived together" is incorrect. You can live together as long as you are married. This could have been phrased to seem like people live together as long as they live separate, however in most states (at least on my end) one must live with the other spouse's legal name on their tax/bank accounts and social security cards, so that one does not become an "adult" without actually having been legally married. I think it's more like one spouse is in "a relationship with" (in other words,

Input: Use freights transportation.<n>Output: Using freights transportation is cheaper. There is a freight terminal every where there is traffic. Therefore, you do not need to cross the border at airports. You can drop the goods in your garage at a cross over. The freight transportation is cheaper than what you pay for crossing borders at airports.<n>Therefore, the final answer is Freights transportation.<n><n>The above question is supposed to be about a hypothetical situation where you have to deliver the product to someone in a remote country where you have no one or where you have no money. The task is to come up with two possible ways of sending freight and costs associated with those costs. There should be some estimate of costs, such as time and money. This is supposed to be a comparative-marketing question.<n>Suppose you have to deliver an item of clothing with 50 pairs of socks to a family in the remote country. The clothing is valued the same as a pair of socks. The socks are 50 cents each. You have to deliver the clothing on a boat. The cost would be $50. Then you have to pay for fuel and the cost of the sailboat. The cost of the sailboat would be $1,500 for one pair of shoes. The freight component and fuel (fuel costs) would account for the total freight costs. Therefore, the final answer is 500.<n><n>Input:The book The Road to Serfdom is scheduled for release in October 2001.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:What do you get for not moving your car during the required time? Choices:  A: towed B: accidents C: driving D: getting tired E: ticket<n>Output:		 0<n>Input: How much money does a person have after spending $1,000 on their car?  Choices: A: $10 cash B: $10 in savings C: $10 in credit card D: $15 in debit card E: $500 in cash<n>Output: Assuming the car is in a state of maintenance, the car owner will need $500 from their savings to pay for maintenance.  Since $1000 will cover routine maintenance such as engine oil changes, it will be less than $500.  The car will need $500 added for repairs for all of the $1,000 costs.  Then the car owner will need to add $100 per year to their credit card debt in order to cover the new debt.  At what rate will this annual debt be added in 2 years after that?<n>Output: Assuming a car is rented for one week, the rental rate will be $30/day for the first week or $190 for the entire rental. How much would the owner pay for the rental?  Output: Suppose the car has $0 in repairs, and the car has $0 depreciation. Then the price of the car divided by the ownership cost ($0) is $7.50/day. This is the initial value of the rental, divided by the ownership cost. So at this price the total monthly rent (rent + depreciation) will be $140.<n>Output: Assume that a rental car company offers 30 day rentals. Based on your question you could have an average of 2 cars per person in this situation. Suppose that at an average of 1 week/month each car will need to be rented at an average of $35/month for 30 days. Assume that this is equal to the cost of a new car. The total rental price for 30 day rentals for one car is $2,400. The total cost for 30 days ($2,400) divided by the average of 1 week rental per car ($35/ month and $35/ rental = $1,200) is $150. This is the cost of a new rental car + depreciation. The average price of a car is $6,800. So that price is a fair estimate of the total cost of renting only one car. So the total rental cost minus depreciation is $900. So the net cost of renting one car for 30 days is $1,700. The total cost divided by 30 days is $150. Therefore, the total cost for renting one car for 90 days is

He sends Bob via a conveyor belt to a holding pool where he is fed, clean-lined, and released.  He returns to the trap hole and catches another 12-foot alligator. Bob is then released to the lake.  This time he breaks loose and swam a few hundred yards to the shore and returned to the reservoir.  He is now 16 feet long with a snout that protrudes up to 3 feet above water.  He was caught in the trap while the trap was in motion. The trapper does not want Bob to escape and end up in the next lake nearby.  In his haste to capture Bob, he accidentally traps 8 more of those gigantic boogers, so he starts hauling them out of the pond through the conveyor belt.  At the end of the conveyor belt, all 16 feet of alligator are hauled out.  The trapper can’t seem to find a way to get the last 8-foot-long booger back out of the pond.  He asks one of the employees to take a bucket of water and lift out the 8-foot-long thing, which is all that is left of the 12-foot-long gator. All the while, he’s trying to collect himself. When he finds Bob, he thinks about the eight-foot alligator that bobbed up out of the water.  He sees what is left of that other eight-foot-long gasser. Just then, the man who was handling the water bucket walks out onto the conveyor belt and recognizes the last-eight-foot-long all-igator

The average rental car rental for a couple of weeks is about $80.<n>What does that cost per car day for staff?  How much would it cost if the rental cost increased every time the number of employees increased?  The average daily cost for a hotel room is between $150 and $200 per night.  How is this different?  Would a hotel charge staff as much if they had to rent 2 cars a day?<n>Answer: The hotel would provide the space for the printer but would not have to pay for drivers, storage, etc. If the daily car rental cost for a new car that required more staff increased from $80 to $200, then the hotel would have to provide that extra car for each additional employee (a total of 12 employees) for each day the new car cost $200.<n>Solution:<n>$800 * 13 = $20,800 / 120 = $854 * 120 = $13,600 per day.<n>This means that only 52 cars would have to be purchased (each costing $854) to meet the weekly rental car needs of 24 employees.<n>If the increase in staff requirement is 1,200% than the initial purchase costs would have to drop from $854 per car to $988 per car.<n>Solution :<n>52 cars * 24 x $854 = $2,622,000<n>52 cars * 24*$854 = $4,966.00<n>The daily cost to staff 24 cars would, therefore, total $3,648,000<n>Sub(2,666) / 24 = $21,849<n>Sub(2,300) / 24 = $30,742<n>Sub(2,600) / 24 = $47,920<n>Add $21,849 to $4,966 and get $9,979<n>This means that the total cost for the 24 cars is $37,829.00<n>Sub(2) / $25,000 = $3,812,000<n>Sub(3) / $4,966 = $6,547,000<n>Sub(4) / $6,547 = $9,979,000<n>Sub(5) / $9,999 = $

At the time of maturity, there are a total of 735,000,000 Treasury bonds outstanding.  Assume a yield of 4% for the government issue.<n>Response: A government bond maturing in three years will yield $50/yr plus inflation.<n>Therefore, if one buys the $50 issue at the start of each year, one will, at maturity, be repaid with $50/yr plus $50/yr inflation.  This does not add any purchasing power to the investment.<n>Output:<n>$5/yr+$5+5+3+$50= < $50/yr+$50+<n>1+1= 1/2 so $50/yr+2+2= $50+<n>1+2= < 1/2 so $1/3 so<n>Output:<n>=(1 + 2) x ($50/yr) x $1/yr+<n>=(1 + 1/2) X [50/yr]<n>Where [50/yr] is the yield of the government bond at maturity.<n><n>Input:You know the average price of an egg by its number of shells sold at a specific date in the current day.

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: study french cooking C: taste sauce D: prepare food E: thin sauce<n>Output:		 Each selection, according to the answers given, is a different role, each with different responsibilities, but most are similar in the fact they are required to be done at the restaurant, at regular hours, in a routine manner.<n>Therefore, the cooking role has to be "completed" by cooking at 6:00 - dinner is prepared by 5:00, while the other activities happen in the evening, either in one room or outside the restaurant.<n>Therefore, the first choice says to cook dinner in the evening; the second choice describes the chef; the third says to prepare food, and so on...<n>By the way, I would choose to do two things: cook a meal which is always done in a particular manner (french-style and served at exactly 6:00, using a single cutting board), and to produce two different sauces as described above so I can taste both before cooking the food. So if I chose which one was going to be served at 6:00, I would not be able to taste a different version of the same sauce in that circumstance (since I would know that the original version is always served at 6:00; I would not have enough time to taste the different version if I choose.)<n>So I answer B - a chef cooks dinner at 6:00, prepares food, then serves it on a single serving board at 6:00. Choices: A: cook dinner B : cook a dinner C : cook two different dinners D : cook two different kinds of sauces E : thinsh sauces F : one dish<n><n>Input: A company produces a brand of "dog-meat." Prices of dog food range between $15 and $24, depending on variety. A salesman is visiting a department store at mid-day and is looking for a product that sells for $30 to $40. At any rate, sales manager says sales figures so far show that dog meat costs between $27 and $34...<n>Output: A new price of $30 to $40 is raised from sales manager.<n>So we would answer the following questions:(1) The price is $30 and the dog meat costs $27 in the initial period(2) Now the price is $34, and so the dog meat costs $32 in the 1st period(3) Now the price is only $28, thus the dog meat costs $28 during the period(4) Now the price is between $26 and $28, thus the price is increasing. Does this make sense?<n>

Choices:  A: dream B: knowing C: depression D: pleasure E: nostalgia<n>Output:		  A Dream: Dreams bring great pleasure, and are therefore often remembered with feelings of enjoyment, especially after a long period of waking dreams.  Dreams are also great exercise for the mind.  Knowing: Dreams are often a result of unconscious subconscious thought, especially after an intense mental experience.<n>Dating: Memories are most often remembered after a painful or traumatic experience.  It is difficult to forget about the bad date you had, because your subconscious mind often thinks about that date during intense memory activity.  Depression: Depression is a state in which the subconscious mind no longer thinks well, and tends to believe that other people are worse than themselves.  Because of this, the subconscious mind often holds negative memories of its partner, or other people in general, especially after a long time without a positive experience.  They also tend to believe that these past experiences have shaped them into a bad person, or a bad situation.  They also tend not to feel pleasure, making romantic relationships difficult.  Pleasure is often remembered after spending long periods of time with a positive person. Pleasure is more likely to remember a long time in the past, while memories are more related to the present.  Nostalgia: Nostalgia is often accompanied with feelings of frustration, disappointment or regret, because the person believes that life used to be better.  This is most commonly caused by a long period living in the past, or a long period living by the sea.<n>When you see them, what do you think they see? How well? Write down your answers:<n>1.

Desire is the feeling when you are with someone and want to be with them again.<n>7. Desire can come from a place of frustration, as the person knows that that person did something to them.<n><n>Input: This is a story that begins a little like this... a boy is on his way to play golf with his best bud, Jeff.

Which mobile phone can do this? A: BlackBerry B: Blackberry Curve C: iPhone D: Pre-paid mobile CERTAIN<n>Output: A certain mobile phone (pre-paid) has the capability to keep information about an individual's location to a minimum. Therefore, it has become difficult to locate the customer who gave the customer's address.<n>Output: The person who gave the customer's location gave it to a wrong person, a person who can be tracked. Therefore, the location was not provided or used correctly.<n>Output: The customer gave the location information (phone number) to someone who can be traced using GPS. Therefore, the location of the customer was either fake or wrong.<n>Output: The mobile phone company may sell the location information to advertisers who use it to target consumers. They will use it to send the most relevant advertising to the intended consumer.<n>Output: Because of its security, the mobile phone company cannot reveal the location information of the customer who gave the location information.<n>Output: The number can be tracked using the GPS on the phone at no extra charge. Thus, the location information is accurate to approximately 99% accuracy.<n>Output: The location can be traced once the phone reaches the target address. So the location can be tracked only once and only with a phone with a good GPS.<n>Output: Since the cell phone company cannot tell the difference between fake customers and customers who give specific information while using their phone, it cannot provide accurate customer information.<n>Output: Because the cell phone can be tracked using the phone's built-in GPS system, a hacker can access the phone's location. Therefore, the location information is inaccurate.<n>Output: The locations are not accurate because they use inaccurate location information. The location data is not accurate. Therefore, the phone number in question is not accurate.<n>Output: The information is not real because it is inaccurate.<n>Output; therefore, the location is not accurate.<n><n>Input: What is the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:How can you get in shape if there is no land nearby? Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n>Output:		 The best way is to spend time in the outdoors, but that involves:  A: an entire day or B: a half day C: a half hour D: a minute<n>E: rock climbing<n><n>input:How to get in shape for swimming?

They arrive at the farm at 5PM, and the grandmother tells the son that he is almost ready to go. As the child exits the car, the wind is howling, strong gusts have swept the branches of nearby trees, and the ground is shaking. When he reaches the car, they are so nervous they hesitate for a moment before pressing the button to start the car. In the car, the toddler sits in the back seat wearing shorts and a t-shirt. The parents are sitting in the front seat in sweats and a t-shirt, having just arrived minutes earlier. As they continue to drive in the wind and through the trees, they cannot see ahead without fear of becoming disoriented or stranded. Finally, all of a sudden, a sudden gust of wind rips the car topsy-turvy. In the back of the wind-chimped car, the mother and toddler cry as they experience the first sensation of vertigo and nausea that many of us become unable to deal with in this environment. The mother, terrified, tries to pull over at the only farmhouse on the property, but finds that she cannot drive on the slippery driveway or the high-horsepower tractor that belongs to the grandparents, which has no brakes. She tries pulling off the street near the only farmhouse on an isolated, one-lane road without being able to steer the car. At a near-stop, the mother pulls over, and throws the toddler and grandparents into the back seat of the car and pulls the car over. Both the mother and grandson have faint but intense trembling, and begin trying to call for help on their cellphones. The grandfather, overwhelmed and scared to death, is about to dial 911, when the mother reminds him that she should call first, and then waits to get out of the vehicle while the grandparents call the police through their cellphones. The two then call 911, and a police SUV arrives. The parents enter the SUV, the child takes off

The 50-page ad says it must be done in less than 24 hours in order to be considered.  His preference is not to be interviewed but to be hired immediately.  The employer is asking whether he has any family nearby and if he can live with them during the time it will take to do the job.  The 50-year-old man does not have a family nearby and doesn't have the flexibility to live at home.  He decides to accept the job.

He earned his bachelor's degree two years earlier.  He needs to renew and extend his license at the county he has recently lived in.  The requirement for getting the certificate is to get a "probationary certificate" from the previous county.  This requires a "paperwork renewal" from the previous county he has lived in.  After the state has examined the previous county records, the man must provide them with proof of identification from the new county.  This "paperwork renewal" needs to be sent in to the first county, so the man will need to wait for the state for approximately three months before the paperwork can be sent to the next county.  The man's wife is a stay-at-home mother and needs to return to work at some point.<n>Output: 24/32=<<24/32=12>>12 days.<n><n>Output:A woman's husband passes away while on active duty overseas.

She plans to put him on a farm, where he can grow corn. It takes her 40 days from the time the child is taken from her care to the time the child is grown enough to harvest corn. He will turn 22 in 10 years. How many miles can he walk on a good day? It will take 20 miles per person.<n>Output: 10 x 20 = 400 miles.<n>For a two person family, this would mean a 20 mile round trip each day. So he would be able to go 200 miles per day, but he wouldn't be able to do it all at once, because of time constraints and other reasons. So if he is walking 20 miles per day (one mile per foot), then he will need to cover a mile each day which will total 80 miles per day. He will need to walk the 40 miles in 20 days, so he will need to walk the 320 miles per month, therefore covering the distance he walked in the 20 days. So, he will end his time on the farm about one year from the time he left it. What will he do?<n>Output: What would he expect?<n>Output: Will you want your son to see him when he leaves?<n>Output: How long from the time he left, will he want to see him?<n>Output: What will he tell him?<n>Output: How is this different from working with concrete?

That way they could be in a position where they had to share.  When Jill complained about C, he changed his remark and said, If there was anything I could buy for you that will help you, I would.  He also commented about being disparaged and said that some people use the word disparagement as an insult, but it doesn't to him.  He considered that being disparaged might not hurt him since people had more respect for him than for some of his friends, but it would sting after a while.

If she thinks he was being hostile, then that's a problem.  The situation needed to be addressed one way or another.<n>When John wanted to discuss A, he said:  I wouldn't call it hostile.  I think I was trying to make her understand that things had been bad between the two of you.  I feel badly that she didn't know why you were getting so frustrated, so I told her, I'm so sorry about all this, and that I'm sorry you're upset with me.  That sounded pretty calm to me, so I told you that if you were angry with her,

His property is located in a flood plain. He has a number of field irrigation facilities installed and maintained.  A river runs from his property in a southeasterly direction down the center of the state. The river flows inland and then flows north in a generally east to west direction.<n>The farmer lives about 1.5 miles wide from the river. His house is about 9.5 feet high and 40 feet long. The river is approximately 3.5 feet wide. The river banks rise up to a maximum length of 0.5 miles.  If the river was to rise up to the level at which the house is located 1 mile from the river, his field irrigation facility would be damaged.<n>The river is at a level of 11.7 feet. The average river level is about 9.5 ft.<n>The river flow in its natural course is about 9,000 gallons per day at the upstream end of the river and about 6,000 gallons per day downstream from the upstream end of the landowner.<n>The river is 10% under its normal flow level.<n>The river is currently operating at 60% of its normal flow level. The expected peak volume is 22,000 gallons per day.<n>The river is normally operated at about 60% of its normal speed. The river will normally operate at about 20% of its normal speed if the minimum inflow increases from 60% down to 45%.<n>A flow rate meter measures the flow rate of the river.  This flow rate is only an estimate of the river's true flow rate.  There are other factors (land use, sediment content, the amount of water available at the various discharge gates) that affect this flow rate, such as the difference between the average current flow rate and the flow rate one experiences at certain locations.<n><n>Input:For $1,000,000, how many horses do you see being moved?

He was tired and unhappy, so he sat down on a small tree stump, rested his head on his knees and thought: "I feel so alone. I want so badly to feel loved again." But his heart broke as he felt himself be turned inside out. "Ain't nobody here to love me," the man thought. So he felt sad. Then he felt hungry. He decided to make himself a sandwich, take a walk around the forest and look for a suitable place to eat. "I have been wandering for way too damn long. I want some good food, " he thought. "That's the last I need, I got to eat. " As he was searching for food, he noticed a cave door on the ground. "Where did this cave ever come from?" he thought and wondered. After thinking about the cave for a while, the man felt like walking deeper into the forest. "It was so dark I just looked around and discovered the cave door," he thought. "I must've walked in here when it was still light out." The guy walked in and found himself at the door of a strange cave. "This is the weirdest fucking cave I have ever been in," he thought. "How did a cave ever come from where I saw?" He started to follow a dim path inside the cave looking around. Then he noticed that there were strange markings all over the area, which suddenly made him question how he had ever found the cave door. He thought about how he had been able to get into the cave without getting lost and how strange he thought the markings were. How was he able to find the cave entrance without moving out of his own way and he felt confused. After thinking about this for a while the man said, "Why the hell does this cave have markings?" Suddenly, his phone started ringing and he felt his head getting warmer. "Yeah, I got a text! I got my phone back! I got my phone! He said 'what happened to the cave that I found?' The dude started freaking out as he realized he had left his phone behind. The man was very confused by this situation and he looked right at the door of the cave but the marks were gone. So he decided to go to the place where he found the cave. "That guy probably stole my phone because I was walking too quickly to remember what I had walked in here to find. How can he not be the one that

The company plans to spend $75,000 to make a new pipeline to transport crude oil north through Louisiana, with an estimated cost of $200,000.  An existing pipeline will remain south of the Gulf, and is expected to carry the oil until at least $600.  Bob plans to do the necessary work on site to allow the old pipeline to remain functional.  Assuming that the pipeline will not be needed for 20-30 years, the company will have to pay $150,000 for its installation and $15,000 for Bob's labor and materials.  Since Bob is a carman and does not have the time to assemble the pipeline, should he be hired to do the installation for this project?<n>Input: Bob has the correct tools. He can install the pipeline on the site (he does not have to purchase construction materials from suppliers), and there will not be any traffic delays due to his work.  So he should be hired to do the work.<n>Output: Bob has the correct skills for the job, and no other qualified contractors are working the project. So he should be hired.<n>Note: Because Bob is a carman, he does not need to purchase construction materials for the job. And he is working for a reasonable rate. The company will pay him so he is not making unreasonable amounts of money.<n><n>Input: Bob was out repairing a car engine.

The police department will respond to all such complaints. The police chief may impose a fine on at least 7 of those 100 people since he can determine that at least 70 of them have violated local noise ordinances. Thus the total cost to be avoided by the city and its people is >200 or 2/3rds of a million dollars.

This will take up lots of legal time and legal fees. These costs have to be included in the estimate of the economic costs described above.<n>These 100 people make up 20% of the population and make up most of the social costs involved in resolving the noise complaints.

All of the above<n>Output: It will take 5 months for the $1000 plan and 2 months for the SEP plan to pay in $1,000 and $1,500, respectively. The other accounts will pay in $125 and $1250, respectively. The $3,750, or $12,500 for the Roth IRA, will take 6 months. The $5,875, or $19,250 for the SEP will take 7 months. Thus, the max amount will be $9,950. And since a $1000 plan is only $1000 and a $1,500 plan is only $5,500, the max would be only $6,900. And since none of these plans is really maxing out anyone's money, the max will be only $4,800. And since none of them is maxing out my money, the max will still be only $3,775. And since none of this really counts against me in the tax code, the max will be $3,775.<n>Output: The maximum is $25<n>Output: The max is $100<n>Output: The max will be $25<n>Output: If this money is maxed out, then the max in the other accounts will be only $225<n>Output: $5,855 maximum<n><n>Input:An airplane flies over Niagara Falls.

Upon opening the door, it jumped on top of the bed.  It then leapt up towards the ceiling in an attempt to find a comfortable perch and to scare the dog off.  When it settled on what was apparently a perch it fell down and landed in the dog's lap while on the bottom of the bed.  The cat was not aware of the event and was playing happily on the bed until it heard the dog barking.  Thinking that this meant there was a threat, the cat ran from the bed towards the door.  It immediately heard the dog chasing it as its ran at high-speed the room.  The cat tried to leap towards the door, then quickly reversed to return right at the door, still having the dog chasing after it.  When it came to the door, it suddenly realized it had locked the door.  The window that the kitten had used to look over the bed was now closed by the dog.  So the kitten got up, fell backwards and hit the door frame, making a painful noise. The dog did not stop the chasing and jumped onto the bed from the other side of the window it had been looking at earlier.  The owner, in an attempt to scare the dog off, got up from his chair in the dining room and walked to the window to open the door.  As the dog continued to chase the kitten, he began banging on the door until the owner relented and went back to dinner. The owner felt bad about how the kitten had been treated, so after dinner he gave the little tabby an affectionate scratch on the back of the neck.<n><n>Which of the following statements is correct?<n>* The cat decided to hide behind a bed<n>* The cat decided it would try to escape the room<n>* The owner decided to hide in his chair<n>* The owner decided that the kitten had not been treated as it deserved<n>* The owner decided the kitten had been treated as it deserved

Most people live in areas where there is either no highway to drive down or very limited access at best. Those few cities that do have highways usually have traffic lights and traffic laws. There are also other traffic alternatives like taxis or limousines that are expensive and can't always take you where you are going.<n>In the past, getting from one destination to another only required walking. You would walk from your home to the post office or from the post office to your local grocery store or store or bank and then from the supermarket or bank to your home. But since walking is not very safe, the walking routes have changed quite a bit as well, with bicycle paths, skateboard parks and pedestrian bridges connecting major urban centers together.<n>Therefore you have a much more convenient type of travel now than you did when you were young; cars are your mode of transportation, and the walkers, runners, bicyclists and people in wheelchairs are now using your highways as their own.<n>In this world, there are plenty of places that people would not want to walk at all, where it may not be safe to walk alone. Therefore most people prefer to rent a car and avoid walking at all costs. Even places like Hawaii or Singapore don't allow people to walk alone in their own neighborhood, even if a place has a safe pedestrian crosswalk to the road that they can use.<n>So now you have a problem when you want to go outside: where you walk to work, to the market, to your doctor in the local hospital, to the pharmacy, or to the bank? Is walking safe and convenient for these places that you usually go to?<n>The answer to this question is, of course, a simple yes if you have the right mode of transportation for your trips. People can use wheelchairs or electric scooters and motorized carts to their ability to get around safely. People can also use hand-held canes, walkers, walkers with handrails, crutches or canes with wheels.<n>Most people in wheelchairs don't drive, and even fewer people use electric scooters at walking speeds. People with wheelchairs, crutches, walkers and people in wheelchairs do not use their wheels

An ordinary telephone card held two telephone numbers. However, in the late 1950's, the practice of "dial up" was replaced by the "digital telephony" telephone system, which uses an electronic transmission system to transfer data over the Internet.<n>A digital phone card holds a digitizing device with an electronic interface. The digitizing device uses a digital computer, which calculates the location of each data packet to and from the Internet data network.<n>The digitizing device holds a transmitter and a receiver, which transmit and receive voice data. In one embodiment, an Internet data connection permits the transmitter to transmit voice data with a telephone card. The telephone card also permits the telephone line connection.<n>The digitizing cable, which transfers digitized voice data and data packets, connects the telephone card to a modem at the end of the call. From the modem, the digital calls are transferred through the Internet.<n>The digitizing and data transmissions of the telephone call are made on an "Internet Protocol" ("IP") network, which uses a digital telephone line. The data packets are transferred by the same network using the same network protocol.<n><n>Input: A bank, with a total deposits of $9 million, announces that there will be no interest paid on any outstanding bank deposits as of January 1, 1992.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:If a person wants to buy a radio, where are they likely to go? Choices:  A: station B: every car and house C: shop D: bedroom E: space shuttle<n>Output:		  There are only 40 radio stations in the United States, so all people will have to go to one of the 40 stations.<n>If a person wants to sell a radio, where are the people likely to go? Chooses:  A: supermarket B: supermarket B: department stores C: internet D: radio shop<n>Output: There are only 40 radio shops, so all people will need to go to one of them<n><n>Input/Output:  At a company's headquarter, 100 sales representatives are interviewing prospective clients. Each interview takes 20 minutes of conversation and two minutes of listening time to be sure the sales representatives are getting the information they want or need. Each response is scored by each sales representative. When the score is 15 out of twenty-five, the response rate for the interview gets too high, and the interview is postponed. If the score is 40 out of fifty-five, responses are discounted to give respondents an incentive to keep their score high. A score of 50% or less on the interview is interpreted as a negative response, and the interview is cancelled.<n>Consequently, for each 10% increase in the response rate, five additional interviews will be scheduled. At a rate of 5 minutes a person, that means the response rate must be reduced by 10% in total - an interview scheduled for 10 minutes will be scheduled for 15 minutes. The last two interviews will then be scheduled for 30 minutes in total, and the response rate will be 20 out of 25. So for 10% of the interviews, a response rate of 10% is to be expected.<n>Then the total response rate can be used to determine an average score for each interview based on the response rate for each participant.<n>For 100 participants, the total response rate of 10% would be = 10^(10x+1/2)<n>= 10^(10x)/4 + 4<n>= = 0.5X<n>= 0.5X + 5<n>That leaves 5 times the response rate of 20% required to reach a response rating of 50%.<n>For 50% of interviews, the total response rate is = 5^(50/25)/22 + 22<n>= = 0.03X<n>= 0.03X + 5<n>As a result, the response rate for 50% interviews with 20 out of 25 response rates of 40% requires 45 minutes of total listening time. It takes 100 minutes to get into each interview mode.<n><n>Input: A person decides to renovate every room on his

She then tells Joe her story of losing her job from an old injury in a car accident, and Joe's response is that a good driver isn't worried about having his car repossessed.

Joe decides to hitchhike across the country and find a car, but he is only able to find one that's already been used for a week, so he doesn't make it all the way to California.

This is a long, drawn out game and has many ways to change and affect the outcome of the game. The batter should be ready to strike out at all times. Every pitch counts and it is very necessary for the batter to strike out all three times throughout a game. The batter will be called out after 9 outs and may be in the field and still steal a base as many times as necessary. The next time a batter hits balls to a non-base hit location the batter must wait ten seconds as the pitcher comes back out from the time it was called out. After one of the pitchers finishes his inning, he must immediately go back in time. The pitcher can also call the batter back out to the mound if he has to stop himself.<n><n>Input:Three golfers are out on the 18th hole. One player has played a hole in one by hitting a ball over a large boulder on a straight drive to the middle of the fairway and hitting the ball in such a way as to make it as flat as possible. Another has played a hole in two by hitting the ball so high that it bounces off a small rock in the front fairway and bounces around until it reaches the back pin. The third one just hit his tee shot so badly that it went through into the creek. Which hole do you say is harder?<n>Output:The one hole that hits into the creek is the easiest because the ball has already come way out of the creek. It will stay out of the water even under heavy wind.<n>The other three holes are all extremely difficult. The first one takes many balls, especially if the ball is very hard and takes more than one player to hit. The second is impossible to make flat enough to do it in. The

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:She was processing the wool, she kept her leg bouncing to operate the what?

Which one is taller? Choose an answer.<n>Output: All trees grow at equal potential.<n>One tree has equal potential for water, but the other tree has equal potential for wind.<n>These two trees have equal potential, but since this tree is older, it has a higher potential for water.<n>Because this tree has a higher potential for wind, it will grow quicker and its potential for water will decrease.<n>This tree will grow slower than the other tree, but because the other tree has a lower potential for water, that means the other tree will also grow slower.<n>So even though the older tree has a smaller potential for water, it will probably not grow as fast.<n>Therefore, the longer the tree grows, the slower it will grow; and the shorter the tree, the faster it grows.<n>So, in a nutshell, all trees grow equal to their potential, but faster trees grow slightly ahead of the slowest trees, and trees that are slower grow slightly behind slow ones.<n>So, in summary, in this case, because the older tree has a higher potential, it will grow faster than the other tree.<n>But in all cases, it's the amount of time that each tree has that determines the growth.<n>So, in all cases, the younger tree will grow slightly faster than the older tree, but because the older tree has equal potential for both wind and water, it will only grow faster when it has more time to grow.<n>So the final correct answer to this question is YES!<n><n>Input: A farmer wants to know how long it will take for a certain amount of potatoes to grow.

The family eats a lot of salads, so is there or is there not room on the refrigerator for different types of salads?<n>Output: Yes; they have two or three refrigerators and one freezer, but each child has his own meal.  You could certainly have multiple food refrigerators, but this might take up most of the living room, especially if they share a kitchen.<n>Which would you choose, and under what circumstance (time limits, etc.)?<n>Input:  The weather outside is not good, so they are going to stay inside and eat dinner under a big blanket.  The family will eat a hot meal first, and then watch TV and play video games after.  Since they have a family computer, they can work on their homework after reading their stories.  The family also has a TV, so watching TV after supper will be ok, plus they could play a game of pool or video games.<n>Input:  Two friends are going out to dinner and one of them has to get up to take one child to get a tooth fixed.  He can put the remaining child's homework in a bag and put in the bag when they leave for dinner.  He can then pick out the homework as soon as they arrive at the restaurant.<n>Output:  That sounds like a good plan.  A or B?<n><n>There is no particular reason you have to have a specific answer.<n><n>Each child's meal is probably better than any other family's.<n><n>Each child eats the same things at the same time of day.  That might be ok, too.

The wind was about 20 miles per hour at the time so the altitude was around 1400 feet.  The temperature was 70 degrees Fahrenheit when the wind was at that altitude.  The wind was blowing 20mph at the time.  Wind force is 8 meters per second, the temperature at that altitude is about 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the wind speed at that altitude is 20 km/hour.

After an ice-water splash is thrown on the aircraft’s glass cockpit, what is the aircraft’s speed?<n>Now it says 3 Miles per second....<n>So it says 2.7 miles per second.. and the speed after a splash is 7.75 miles per hour.... so I can put a 6 back in the distance because the plane is going over 12 miles...  So...  2.7 miles per seconds  + 7.75 miles per second  = 23 miles per sec  So it is not really 3 miles per second but...  23 miles per sec  + 6 miles per sec = 30 miles per sec... so the altitude was about 8,500 feet!  So the altitude before the icing water splash was 9,500 feet.... so that's why the plane takes a long time to arrive at its destination????...  So the altitude after the ice-water splash is 11,900 feet... so it's closer to 14,500 feet....  So then the  altitude after the splash is 12,000 feet...... so the airplane is 13,500 feet above sea level....  So then the altitude AFTER the ice-water splash was 12,000 feet......and so it is 13,000 feet above sea level???? and so on and so forth... so... 3.67 miles per second.... so it is not really 3.67 miles per sec but it says 3.67

The airplane had to be equipped with air conditioning due to the tropical climate. What was the best/most cost-effective way of installing the air conditioning to preserve the airplane's interior temperature?  Output: To minimize the number of required fans, all the interior surfaces (e.g., glass, leather, carpet) must be cleaned before installing air conditioning. An air conditioner will be installed near the cockpit which will be used on takeoff and landing to make it easier to cool the cabin. The only available area of the interior to install the air conditioner was the lavatory. Therefore, the only option was to install a hot air system which could only be used when the airplane was in flight. The total cost was estimated to be $250,000.00 and would be spread over two deliveries.<n>Output: The airplane cost less to make with the air conditioning installed than to buy without the air conditioning. In the end, the total cost was $125,000.00 which paid for the airplane and the air conditioning installation.<n><n>Input: In order to minimize water use, a water treatment plant will begin to be built on site.

There are a lot of ways, and the first one is not true. 80/60 would mean that the person on the highway is expected to travel 80 miles per hour while passing other vehicles. Since there is no way for someone to reach 80 miles per hour, the best thing is for them to stay the speed limit and not go any faster than their safe limit. (80/60 also doesn't make sense in your answer. If the person has to be 80/60, it means that their maximum speed is 80%. If that is the case, they would need to travel 30 miles per hour in order to reach their destination. If the limit for the specific highways is 80 MPH, then they need to travel 30 MPH, since 80 MPH is not 80% of 80, so they would need to travel 2 MPH to get to their destination.)<n><n>2.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:Where do you wait in a reception area for a meeting? Choices:  A: hall B: motel C: hotels D: law firm E: office building<n>Output:		 Where do you prefer to wait for a meeting? If you have to choose a number on the scale of 10-20, the answer depends on several factors.<n>The first factor is that you have time and the other factors are not relevant.  There is a good chance that if there is a meeting that will involve a lot of people the number of persons in the room will be low.<n>When in a room of 25 persons or more, it is important to keep the number of people lower.  If there are two people in a room of 25 and two people in a room above and two people in a bedroom the likelihood is too high for the room to be filled.<n>On a similar note, when there are fewer people you must use a more efficient meeting space.  If there is a meeting room with only one person in that room it is better to go somewhere else.<n>How would you decide in an emergency where not everyone would want to be in the room of someone who might not be there?<n>Which do you prefer?<n><n>Input:Do you prefer to play cards or chess with people sitting on your right or left side? Choice:<n>Output: What happens to the other people?<n>The rules of chess were very similar to the rules of card games.  The two opponents were sitting on opposite sides of the board.  In order to play, it is necessary to pass your turn to the player you are trying to play against.  Thus, sitting on your right or your left sides means that you are passing your turn to the opponent sitting on your right or right side.<n>A new game will be started when somebody takes control of your turn.<n>Note: Since the number of people in a room is limited most chess players prefer to play cards as a game.  They are more cooperative and you do not have to wait as long for your turn.  Playing cards allows the use of dice.  Using dice for playing chess also allows for greater opportunities for strategy.  Thus, these tactics usually have advantages in chess games than they do in chess games.<n><n>Input:The car rental agency is located in Dallas, Texas.

He is disappointed that her light switch was on "off," so he tells her to turn her light on.  The way he says this is much like a husband who says to his pretty wife "you're supposed to turn on the light when you get up and go to work and stuff."  His "let me help you with that switch" is obviously a subtle hint that, after dinner, he is going to put some clothes on her, or perhaps get her things out of the "stuff" drawer on her dresser.  His first thought, she had to be nice to him, but her second thought, what do you mean you aren't home?  He turns the light on and gives her some advice on what to do about the light switch:  “turn off your light when you go to sleep and I think you should make your bed to make yourself feel better.”   A bit of a stretch, but I don't think he was being nasty in any way.  He just meant that the light when she goes to sleep at night could keep her awake, if that's what she wants.<n>Mary’s first thought after he finishes telling her what she has to do is:  “wow … that was sweet of you, but who put that in my little box of nice girls?”  Now she’s wondering if he’s going to leave her alone at one point, in bed, for awhile – unless his wife is with him, in the morning (he might have thought there would be a bathroom visit in the morning …).<n>The light goes off, Mary is just thinking about turning it on again — until she realizes she is awake and it’s 2:00 AM in the morning.  When she decides that she needs to get up, there is a voice telling her she should stay put, that they will be safe.  Maybe.<n>Mary decides she might as well take the light switch to the bedroom where she has her key so there is no chance of her being

Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:What past time are people engaged in when they are traveling along liquid? Choices:  A: sail boats B: question authority C: high fives D: share things E: learn from each other<n>Output:		  What people travel on road  is  traveling along liquid. A person goes to a city, drives from his own home to the city. He drives 3 miles one way driving slow on fast traveled roads. Along the road he can find parking to park his car or parking to park people's cars near him or near parking where he can make some money if some people's cars will be left.<n>Output: Where you parked is a matter of location in space, not time.  You have to park when possible and not on the streets close to parked cars.  In the city there are many parking places that are not crowded and thus you might park as soon as your car starts moving, a spot might open up and you will park there the rest of the day.  When you go out on the road early in the morning, when there is traffic, you can park in a parking lot next to a parking place that is too crowded and empty most of the day.<n>Once you get used to the parking lot, you know where it is.  Then you can find a parking place in the downtown area that you have never been to and which is empty.<n>That might fill you up.  As your car starts to move slowly it does more walking, more talking and so on.<n>After a while you have a map of your city.  Then you can drive on the road without a map, and you can park anywhere in the downtown area, except maybe where you might park and which is far from the parking place which is hard to find.  The only way to know which place is the best for driving is to go to it.<n>You do the same when you travel by car, or when you leave your house, or when you go to work.  The thing that matters is to go to the place that is a good place to go.<n>So when you go to the parking place, you have to pick up your car and drive slowly on the road.  Then you have to park carefully near a convenient parking place.<n>Some people go to places where they don't know the address and where the parking place is, but where it is the better place to park.<n>In those cases, when you get to the parking place, find the first sign of where is the place where all kinds of people are gathered, but it isn't the place of parking that the person you are going to park near.<n>Then you go to the place where there is a lot of cars in parking, and

John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n>Output:		 The jar sat in the kitchen, but it was clear to John that he preferred glass.  And it looked nice in front of the cabinet where he stored his wine.  He was thinking of taking it home, putting it in the trash, and replacing the glass one with a dishwasher safe one, like the ones at Sam's Club.  Maybe he would give the old one to some friend.  He didn’t care where he wanted to go.  He just wanted to be somewhere new.  He would call if the jar got too heavy for him, and get another glass one, too.<n>But when he got home, he realized the jar had become heavy.  He didn‘t remember ever buying it.  It was clear the container had been at the house for a long time.  But what jar was it?  Was it all of his wife's wine?  Who had he really wanted to talk to anyway?<n>It was all that wine.  The way she would have liked it, because he would have liked to buy some for her...<n>He would see about buying another jar.  He couldn’t move the one he was holding, though.  He reached for the empty one and tried to push it away.<n>But it was very heavy.  No, he said out loud, it was too big for the cabinet.  He had only one choice.  He took a step forward, and placed one hand on the jar’s rim.  But he couldn’t move it.<n>It was heavy and heavy and heavy and heavy, and now he could see the light from his window reflected in the jar as clearly as if he were outside.  That was a good thing.  There would be no talking to anyone while he had to be carrying 400 bottles of wine.  He began to cry: “God is good, all the time, all the time.  I never worry for tomorrow or about tomorrow and the past is behind me.  Everything will be right.  Always.”<n>And God said, “I made the grape vine grow and the wheat yield, all that I have, even though I am rich beyond your knowledge, and still I give to all the poor.  I didn’t make it all, I only put my mark on it.  I planted it all, and it’s my vine.  Do you know of anyone who has my wine jar?”<n>

You try to navigate through the traffic, but your headlights indicate that there is no place to go.  You drive to the parking lot at the service center and try to park there.  However, the lot is too far away, and there is no street parking nearby.  You try to find space in a nearby building, but to do this, you must park in front of the shop, which would require being visible to anyone in the shop.  In fact, your headlights are too dark for the shop employees to see you as you park in front of them.  Can you find an alternative way to park?  Your answer will be in the negative.  Why?<n>Input:- There are many factors involved in how people move, as stated by Albert Einstein on June 27th, 1905.  Some factors are: the cost, time, distance, cost, efficiency, and convenience.  These factors and others factor into the choice of where to park.  Therefore, your answer will be in the positive, except for one factor - the distance to your destination.  This is a good factor to include though, in your answer.  For your example, you might say that your destination is 45 minutes away by car, so 45 minutes of driving in the direction of your destination will result in 2 hours 15 minutes of time spent in traffic.  But if your destination is 45 minutes by car, then 15 hours 5 minutes driving time will result in 45 minutes of time spent in the traffic.  In sum, the longer you drive, the more time you will spend in the traffic.  Thus, you can expect your answer to include the distance to your destination in your answer.<n>Input:- To avoid damage to a car's wheels, would be be more likely to get a tire replaced before replacing the car.  The number of wheel changes will depend on your preference of the tires.  Do you prefer to get new tires before changing the wheels, or after both are changed?  Your answer will reflect

The teacher advises her to pursue a Bachelor’s degree after she completes the three courses.<n><n>Output: A master’s degree in computer science is the option the student chooses.

The company that was doing the work is closing, so the engineer has the company take over the remaining work. The new company takes on the work by offering to pay 75% of the cost and the remaining 25% will be billed to the company who was performing the work. Why did the engineer decide to use this approach, and how will the project end?<n><n>Output: The company who was performing the building work has agreed to pay 75% of their contract cost and the remaining 25%. For the remaining quarter of the project, the company must pay 75% of the full contract cost, plus 25%.<n>The engineer then uses the company who performed the work to take on the remaining work.<n>Now the company is billed for two quarters of work, both 75% of their contract.<n>The engineer’s strategy was to make the company responsible for all part of the contract.<n>Since the company that was performing the work agreed to help out for the remaining 25% of work, they now owe him for working 80% of the total cost of the project.<n>The company that performed the work did not owe the engineer a dime of the three-quarters of their contract cost.<n>Since the company agreed to help the engineer out for a quarter of the project, they must now pay him a fraction of the entire project.<n>The percentage owed changes slightly over the course of the three quarters, but the final outcome is roughly the same.<n>

Choices:  A: maine B: boston C: beach town D: coastal cities E: ocean<n>Output:		 For the total cost of one week on the east coast the restaurant will cost:$1000<n>For the weekly cost of $1000, the cost of cooking the food in a five-star hotel will be about $3,000, which is about the same.<n>For the cost of three or more nights in the room there is about $2,500 spent per week, which is about half the hotel expense.<n>Therefore, the weekly cost of a week for one person is about half the dining expense ($2,500) + the hotel food expense ($1,500).<n>Therefore, the weekly seafood restaurant cost is $4,000, but the food expense is only $6,500, so it is still about the same cost as dining at a five-star hotel ($2,500) for the last three or four nights, which gives it a total of $30 to $40 per night.<n>Therefore, the final answer is $30<n><n>Input (Answer):The farmer has 30-40 acres in a field.

A baker needs to sell 12,000 kilos in a week. What is the average cost to produce 1,000 of the 10 most popular breads?<n>Output:Bread and butter can be divided up into many different categories and it is helpful to know which of these categories the bakery is selling specifically.  For example, if the bakery is selling white wheat bread from a bread pan on sale at $3.00, the total cost to produce a single loaf would be $200.  The cost to sell the bread pan alone would be another $100.  This would then leave $240 for the bread itself.<n><n>Output: In order to determine the type of product sold, it is necessary to know the total amount of sales the bakery has made in a particular week.  Calculating this number requires looking at each type of product the bakery sells.  For example, an oven-ready oven-proof pan sells for $15.  Calculating the sales total of all 10 baking pans in the baking sales total $60,000.  So the total sales amount in the weekly period is $6,000.  A baker needs a total of 40 baking pans for a week.  Given that the baker needs 40 baking pans in a week, the cost of all 10 different pans would be $600.  Thus it would be necessary for the baker to buy 40 pans in the first week in order to make 4 weekly sales.  After the first week, the baker will need to sell 1,000 different pans in order to make 4 total sales.<n><n>Input: How many cups of coffee would a single serving of java require if the cup was made from 100% raw material?<n>Output: When making a cup of coffee, it is usually necessary to prepare the grounds in a different way in order to make a cup of coffee that will be more than 90% cup

A: Write down an answer that is equivalent to each of the equations; do so for the plane equations and for the car equations.  B: If you were designing the airplane, which one of the following would you choose: (1) to minimize drag at the lowest possible point, or (2) to minimize weight? C: Pick the one that matches the plane equation. D: Pick the one that match the car equation.<n>Input : The plane has three elements, the first of which is its wingspan, or length in meters.  The other two elements are the vertical distance from the surface of the earth's atmosphere to the air’s surface (known as height) and its horizontal distance (also known as span). The span of the wings is the number of arc minutes, or 3°, that you have to lift a given amount of air to get a given distance from the ground.  The car has four elements: its wheels, its tires, its suspension, and its steering.  The distance of the vehicle’s axle from its center is the radius of the wheel, or axles.  The car’s wheel diameter is the circumference of the inside edge of each wheel.<n>Input: Given the length of the car and the distance of the axle from the center, the ratio of the car’s depth to its length is d, which is given by 4*6=20.  How can this be calculated?  D: The ratio of the distance of the axles from the center and the height of the car is r, which is given by 8*4=40.  Where does this number 40 come from? E: Pick the one that you believe to be correct.

She would award each student a grade of C or D for participation. So that night, a team of students approached Mrs. Coady in their classrooms and told her that she could award an extra credit point for getting more than the five questions they had correctly answered, and that everyone getting the correct answers would get to stay in class the next day and repeat the last three questions in a test-like situation.  Mrs. Coady had no idea why she was asked to implement that "cheat" because it sounded like something you'd see in a movie rather than in a classroom.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:The cow would come outside even after the storm had passed, it wouldn't leave the what? Choices:  A: meat grinder B: stable C: red barn D: gate E: green field<n>Output:		 C<n>The cow would come out even AFTER the storm had gone by, it wouldn't leave.<n>Therefore, A was the correct answer since it was more likely for a cow to stay and eat what it had originally eaten than it would leave in the middle of a massive storm.<n><n>Input:There are 3 cowboys working on a ranch for $1,000. The first cowboy, $1,001,000, rides the horse and picks up a load of hay, and then rides the hay wagon for 5.000 miles to the second cowboys station. Then at the third cowboys station the horse and cow come out. What would their total cost be to transport the cows from point A to point B?<n>Output: The third cowboys cost is $1,012,000 because if they drove their animals on their own they would not have to pay for transport to the other spots.<n>So the final score is $1,011,000.<n><n>Input:The weather report for the week beginning September 30th states that 60 mph winds are forecast for Saturday. Given the location of the area of the storm(s) in which the ranch is located, how can the cowboys tell that it has already passed the storm where they found the cows?  Output:<n>If the weather forecast for the week is true, they will be able to determine that the storm is already moved.<n>The only way they can tell that they have already moved the ranch would be if they could find the cows and loaders again after the week is over.<n>Then they would have to determine that the storm passed the ranch.<n><n>Input:What would the cost of the cowboys transportation of the cattle, assuming the weather forecast is accurate, be from point A to point A? Output:<n>The final answer is $8,250,<n>So the final score will be $1,852,000<n><n>Input:A cowboy has a horse worth $1,000 that needs regular feeding. He wishes to keep the horse as part of his business operation, rather than selling it. He decides that he will sell the horse for a profit of $500 to a feedlot, as a means of reducing costs.  If the horse is sold, the cowboys' total expenses for transport will be $250, or $250/1000=2.5 * 2500=2,250*250*500<n>So the final score for your question is $2,250<n><n>Input:The horse

Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:How might people perceive someone they are scared of? Choices:  A: human B: happy C: dangerous D: strange E: weird<n>Output:		 people, especially children, might see the fear in the eyes of someone they are scared of or don’t know well.<n>However, since this person isn’t a real person the person will probably not experience any particular feelings (e.g., happiness, sadness, confusion).<n>So the final answer will be C.<n><n>Input:A car rental agency wants to promote car-rental to business customers. Its goal is to attract customers by giving them free rentals, incentives to use rental cars, and promotions for other products/services that they might consider using.<n>Output:A car rental agency can give car-rental to its business customers at any time.<n>However, if car-rental would be given by the customer to the rental agency rather then the other way (cars rented by the business are a benefit of the business), customer-rental will not increase.<n>In practice, the business cannot give cars to its customers at all (even on behalf of other customers).<n>In theory, if the business does have a customer-rental program, the business can decide to grant only car-rental to some customers over certain criteria (the price of renting a car). The customer-rental criterion is often the highest one, so customers who need rental cars more frequently than others are being offered the choice of cars that are rented for a higher price (e.g., a $250 “high price” car for regular customers vs a $20 rent car). In the long run the goal is to give the higher price car-rental primarily to customers who already rent cars frequently.<n>The final result is that customer-rental won’t go down. After all, the business can’t give out cars anymore. In a normal market the business would not exist if it did not offer car-rental (as an incentive).<n><n>This is all part of an exercise in how some economic models predict effects<n>of government intervention in the market. But the model was not intended to explain<n>what actually happens in the market, only to predict. The exercise<n>will probably produce many different predictions.<n><n>Input:<n>The customer has a car with a service plan for five miles. The car is a 2000<n>cubic inch car.

George sets up office-based computer systems to track this, for example, using Excel, Access, the Internet, etc.  It is the general feeling of the company that this is a great idea, and George is well versed in the subject matter. The company hired George to start by training him so that he would be able to become a "productivity guru," a popular term in the management field.<n>Because of his wealth of experience at the company, George had a strong belief system that was considered "sales-driven," but which is very important to other employees. He does not believe in "user-driven" procedures and systems, which he believes are more efficient.<n><n> George spent $600.00 on training, the cost of which is approximately twice the amount of training time.  This will cover both the training materials and the additional training time needed to reach his goals.  When George has achieved his productivity goals, the company will deduct $40.00/h from his hourly compensation.  George was paid for his time spent for only two weeks after the training was completed.  When George has a $500.00 goal, the company will deduct 40-60% of his salary, since he has a larger goal to reach, but he will be paid the correct amount.<n>George's goals were achieved after only two weeks, and he was paid the correct amount by the company.<n>Input: In a two-week period, how many people do you need to buy a new refrigerator?<n>Output: The exact number given by the consumer depends on the size, type, and number of cabinets.

It is known as a "crystal light fixture".  What is its exact history?<n>Output: It is not uncommon that "crystal light fixtures" resemble something made in the  1930's and on up.  A more likely explanation is that this type of fixture was made to be similar to, but be similar to, a "crystal light bulb".  Crystal light fixtures of this period usually used a small round, parabolic reflector to reflect a light beam that was created by a hot filament with a special, heat-resistant bulb inside.<n>Output: The average white to red light output from a typical "crystal light fixture" is 80 lumens per watt.  The average output from the type of bulb most often used in a "crystal light socket" is 100 lumens per watt.<n>Output: The current "crystal light fixture", as a "crystal bulb", was produced in 1946.  Although the fixture that it resembles may be older, "crystal light" lamps generally are older.  "A crystal light fixture" is most often referred to in the U.S. today as a "crystal lamp" but it is much more accurately referred to as a "crystal fixture".<n>Output: The average output from "crystal light fixtures", such as that in the photo, varies according to the manufacturer, style, and size of the bulb used to make the fixture.  The following table lists the manufacturers as well as the style, size, and output of several common types of "crystal lighting fixtures".  There are also several manufacturers of fixture for "crystal light bulbs".  For each type, please note the type of bulb used for that fixture.  (Although different manufacturers produce different types of bulbs, they often produce the fixture that it resembles.)<n>Output: The average brightness of a "crystal light" fixture, or light bulb, in terms of lumens per watt is 75 lumen.  The average output of "crystal light bulbs" is 50 lumens per watt.

You immediately pull over to check the license plate because you recognize it. (You've visited and photographed this tourist attraction before.) The license plate is a “Florida” plate with an arrow through the middle, and the car's name is "Florida" and on its rear seat rests a “Florida’s Flag” flag. The car also has “Florida’" license plates on its back seat and is fitted with the “Florida State Flag” bumper sticker. The name, “Mark” on the license plate, matches the description under your passenger's seat. The driver and passenger are clearly white males.

He would get up in the morning, and then put them in what state again? Choices:  A: upside down B: in motion C: active D: wakefulness E: resthold<n>Output:		 Each ball was in the middle of a complete cycle.<n>The first 3 balls rolled and dropped straight down without touching the floor.  James placed the next 3 balls in a random pattern in an upside down configuration.  Each ball stayed in its place until the first ball moved into a stationary position.  When the first ball moved, it landed upside down on the ground.  The next time the ball landed in an upside down configuration, it started moving again just as before.  The only time the ball moved was when the first ball moved.  James placed the remaining ball in a random pattern in a motionless configuration.  Each ball in each pattern remained in its upright position until the final ball hit the floor where the last pattern had ended.  All balls remained on the same cycle until all balls had been placed in random pattern configurations. After all balls were placed in random pattern configurations, James placed the remaining balls in the same random pattern configuration. James let the ball bounce once, then reset it in a static pattern.  With the motionless balls left, the ball bounced in motion and a stationary ball was placed.  With the static balls, the balls bounced in motion while the ball on the ground was stationary.  Finally, after the rotating balls, the ball remained on the floor.  Each set ended with all balls on the same cycles except the rotating balls.<n>Input: A farmer is making a decision about moving the cattle north to higher ground, or to South.

If so, then how much of the air in the bag is warmed by radiation (heat)?<n>Output: A 1W lamp emits radiation at a wavelength of λ=2.15cm. At this wavelength the light intensity is 10W/m-2. The light is also absorbed by some substances that reduce the infrared light to near infrared. The radiation intensity in the open air is 5W/m2. Because of this 10W/m2 is more than 5W/m2 in the plastic bag. This amounts to a decrease in the infrared radiation by 15%. The light that passes through the bag is thus reduced by 15% to 2.15W/m2. Consequently the open bag has greater temperature than the closed plastic bag.<n>Input: Two different people have the same number of body cells.

He has been buying eggs with his weekly shopping money for about a year. His friend has asked him to stay with him while he goes to Philadelphia for a convention.  The first visit from his friend will take less than one hour.  The next visit will take 3 hours.  The next visit, after that, will take two days, and on the fourth day, he will only have one day to stay with him.  He wants to make sure that every minute is worth it.  What is the estimated cost for one week at this rate?  What is the estimated price for 5 days (including a trip to Philadelphia)?  What is the estimated number of days he needs to stay at the house?<n>Output: The cost to travel two days to Philadelphia is $35.  The estimated cost for 5 days at the house using his week of travel is $105.  The estimated number of days that he needs to stay at his house is 12.<n>Thus, $105*12=<<105/12=4>>4 days.  Thus, the final answer is 4.<n><n>[The answer is provided in the following comments]<n><n>Discussion<n><n>I've spent many a long weekend driving into my hometown to visit family, and this is an important part of the experience. We've spent several days in my Dad's garage, fixing something that had a leak when we first moved in. It was a fun exercise for me, and it still was fun for him. I can see that it would be even more fun for my husband to have something like that.<n><n>In this case it's not a big investment for either of them (except in gas). The trip will take only 1/2 - 1/3 of one day if you plan ahead.

How much of a problem is this?  Output: Bikini tops are worn as outer layers in summer and winter.  It's difficult to keep the bikini top on without making the top cling tightly against some clothes part of the body.  Some people feel they are too hot while running, so they might pull the top away from part of her body.  This will keep the top hanging uncomfortably against some part of the body.<n>Response: Bikini tops are not acceptable to wear to school because they are hot in warm weather.  They are also inappropriate to wear when swimming, because they are not made for the underwater environment, and because school personnel do not want to be in the area when a student is swimming after the fact because they have nothing to cover their breasts and legs.  Even if a bikini top is on while working, the top must be off while a student is in class.

The dog answers, "Look for yourself."  How would you have answered the question: “If this dog was lying dead at the edge of the roadside and you were stopped on the roadside, would you try to locate the dog by walking over and looking at the ground?

After all, the dog has already explained its answer.  So the AI could easily have answered, "When you first realized that it wasn't a human but a dog and that it wasn't lying and that you would have to look even more closely to find it?"  Or what if the dog asked, "Which way is up?"  In either case, you would respond "Well, the dog said it was lying down.  Therefore, if you want to be sure that the dog is lying down, look at the ground."  In both situations, your answer is the same.<n>Input: Given three different options, what is the likely outcome if the player makes a given choice?  It can be any of three options.

A typical day's flight has 100-150 passengers. In order to cover these flights, most of the airline's planes would be in the air simultaneously. If each plane could carry 2 people on board, this means that the number of passengers on one plane at one time would be approximately 2000. But what if the airlines decided to take extra seats on certain days to accommodate more travelers? Since airplanes are much bigger than most people realize, the plane with the extra seats would not be nearly as heavy as we might expect. So the airplane with the extra seats would weigh approximately 30,000-40,000 pounds. A typical passenger would need to make 4 trips, on each plane, to make it worthwhile to use the extra seats. Therefore, one passenger on the plane would not be able to sit on her own and could not be on the plane twice. Where would a passenger like this be carried? Which airline would cover her costs?<n>Input: On April 16, 1986, a team of meteorologists took a look at the weather map for the next few days.

The shell is the only feature that’s different<n>b. When laid the egg is pale and white<n>c. The egg is fertile<n>d. Its incubation period is 5 days<n>e. Chicken manure is sterile<n><n>2.) A chicken lays its eggs on the first day of spring. In late March, as summer approaches, the male chicks of the hen begin to stand out in the open by laying their eggs in trees in front of the home. A female chicken is now out hunting for the male. On a sunny day in April, when the weather is warm, a female chicken in her breeding territory lays an egg when a male arrives wearing the characteristic blue comb that indicates a male. The egg is fertile. On a cold day a male will not come close to laying an egg. At the end of May, the male chicks leave the breeding territory for the open. The breeding season is over and the female chickens go to their nests where they lay their eggs. On the next spring’s sunny day, a female chicken in the nest will lay her egg. This time the egg is fertile. The egg is fertile because of its incubation period of 5 days, but also by the fact that chicken manure is sterile. Thus, the egg, when laid, cannot be fertilized.<n><n>3.) The male chickens of the hen are on this day being taught how to cross a road. The male chickens are given names and numbers by their father. This day they have to cross a small road with a fence with a guard on top. A male chicken is the most dangerous to cross this road because he cannot see his object of mating. So, each male chicken is wearing on his head, a colored stripe. The male chicken’s number on his head is 5. Each male chicken in the hen, is carrying a basket on which is placed three eggs (two of them fertile).

A female chicken has laid an egg on the first day of May. The egg is fertile, but the egg can only be carried by a male.

Output: Is possible.  The rental charge is $30 per day for two cars and $190 per day for one car. The total cost is $40.<n>Output: The difference in the amount is $3.<n>The answer is $9.<n>NOTE: The rent is $180.  The car rent is $30/day.  Since the car is required as a condition of being allowed on the rental, it is paid and the difference between the total charge and the total rent must be deducted.  The total rental charge is $180.<n>The total rental charge divided by the total amount paid for the two cars is:<n>$180 / 2 = $18.75<n>The total rental charge multiplied by the number of days the car-rental company will rent you is:<n>$180 divided by $180 = $1.50<n>Thus, the total rental charge divided by that number of days is $10.50 (2 x 18.75) which is the difference between the rental charge and the total rent, $10.50.<n>The total rental line is then subtracted from the total car-rental cost to yield the result:<n> $10.50/(=30+20+1) = $9.75<n>Now you can subtract the new difference from the car-rental charges so that $9.75 is added to the rental cost.<n><n>Input:The truck driver leaves a little after 8:00 PM.

He constructed a new base and a new foundation about 50 cm off of the old one. After finishing the foundation he discovered that the slope is so steep that the floor is on a 50 cm high wall. After calculating the height of the existing wall, and measuring the distance of the wall from the bottom of the new base he calculated that he could build an additional 5 cm to the new floor. However, he found that this is too high as it would give him a height measurement. So he did a rough cut in a rough piece and a full cut in the foundation piece to be sure this was correct.

At that time they drive 100 yards to the store to buy something to eat.  The person will drive another 20 yards to a gas station/restaurant.  By the time they are back at home/office, they will have made 400 yards on the freeway.  The person will have driven 6 miles in 8 minutes.  At the gas station, they will have eaten 1,080 calories in 8 minutes.  Their total daily fuel consumption is 1,080 calories.

Choices:  A: driving B: road C: getting tired D: accidents E: ticket<n>Output:		 The total cost of moving a single car according to a list of requirements is $10.00 per mile.  One car with a cost of $10 will take 1367 miles to move (one mile equals to 200 miles, so 1 mile takes 1367 miles, for a total of 1367 miles).  When the total cost of the moving cost is taken into account, an additional 20% increase is needed to get any car out of one state to another state.  This is equal to an increase in cost of moving from California to Texas.<n><n>Input:How many men would be needed to move a single car from California to Texas if it had wheels instead of tires?<n>Output: A minimum of one man would be needed per state plus one extra man in California.  Therefore, the cost per man would be calculated as 1-<<1-<<20>>20.<n>Now multiply that by the number of cars (20) in the car rental agency.  Divide the total cost by 15 (which equals 300 miles) and you have 657,941,800 miles!<n>Now take the 300 miles the car rental agency takes to transfer one car from its home to its new location in Texas.  Since they charge $30/day for that rental, and the total cost of moving the car (10,000 miles, one car) to Texas is $10.00, the total cost of moving one car for 1367 miles in 1367 miles is $10,000 times $30/day.  That is $34,667,667.<n>Now take the total cost of moving a car from California (10,000 miles) to Texas (1367 miles) and deduct the $30/day they charge.  Add the $34,667,737 into your total of $24,668,666, and you have $15,000,000,000, and the total cost to move one car $15 million.<n>Now divide the total amount in your calculator by 1.5.  That is $15 million times 1.5 equals $15,000, which is also the cost of moving one car.<n>And then divide the amount in your calculator by 17, and you have $9.56 million.  Thus, the total amount in your calculus calculator is $9.56 million, which comes to $9.56 per car.  Let us say that you rent 10 cars at $100/day each, or that each car costs $120,

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:James drove his niece to her father.  Where did he drive? Choices:  A: great granddad's house B: family picture book C: brother's house D: family tree E: family reunion<n>Output:		 The family picture book (A) was the family reunion.<n>The family tree (B) was great-granddad's ancestral home.  He hadn't shown the picture (C) to a single person but had been making an effort to invite them for several years.  He hoped that the first family reunions would start next year.  They could start with the one being held in August.<n>The family picture book was the family reunion.  Great-granddad had invited the family (A) to his gathering.<n><n>Input:What is the cost of an individual car ride that lasts one hour?<n>Output:The cost of any "one hour" trip using one car/person is $0.50.<n>This implies that if three individuals in a car travel at the maximum speed (35 mph) for one hour each at $0.50 per hour, then the total cost of a family transportation trip with car is $40 for three people in a car at 35 mph.<n>The cost of using two cars is $1.50 per hour or $2.50 per person.  This means that the cost of three persons in a car traveling one hour at 35 mph in two cars is $3.50 per person.<n>The total cost of a family trip with car and two people in a car traveling one-hour is $12.50 (3/2)*2=<<12.50=10>>7, i.e., $9 per individual and $4.50 per car (including fuel).  This is a total cost of $22 before insurance and gasoline.<n><n>Input:The price a local grocery store charges for an individual item is $1.00.  The average price of a gallon of gasoline for a car is $0.59; therefore, the gasoline price per gallon of gas on the local grocery store will be $59.00/GALLON.  How much will the grocery store charge for an individual item, if one gallon of gasoline is $59.00?<n>Output:The average gas price per gallon of gasoline on the local grocery store, if no gasoline were used, will be $0.35 due to its location less the $1.00/GALLONE (1 gallon of gasoline) per person price charged by the grocery store.<n>Therefore, the local grocery store will charge $0.35 for an $1.00 retail grocery item.<n>So, the retail grocery item (G) will be $0.

The land is paid for in cash but there is no water on the land.  His only water supply is a dam that runs on the same river that supplies other farms in the small town of town.  The water from the dam is filtered, treated, bottled and sold.  The dam and stream supply all of the drinking water in towns throughout the county.  This farmer leases water from the village of town every other year to irrigate his crops.  According to the village administrator, there are 10,000 persons in this area who would sell their homes for $2,000 each year for 5 years.  The price of water is $700 per acre foot (350,000 feet of water) so the value of his land must be approximately $750,000.  The total of the land payments will pay his family $10,000 per year and would be equal of 200 years of payments over the course of 5 years.  The farmer also receives a tax break of $300 on this money.  How much per year will he receive?<n>Output:<n>The total amount of land payments would be $14,000, or $750,000 for 5 years.  So he would receive $3,200 per year.  Based on the value of the water supply, the village was able to put down a $300,000 loan on the land.  As a result, he would receive only $5,100 per year.<n>$15,000 $750,000<n>5x 200<n>1 =<n>Thus, the total is $15

A policeman who has driven by quickly approaches and gives his name to the man to see if it is really missing, but the man claims he cannot show it to anyone else because he received it as a present in the mail. Later, after the two men have been talking for some time and eating lunch at a local restaurant without any help from the policeman, the man asks the policeman if he will show it to him now, since he really wants to see it. The policeman offers the man his watch and tells him to put it on. The man removes his watch but says he doesn’t like what he sees. As he is about to put the watch back on again, another policeman walks by. The first man calls the policeman names, while the second man tells him to take what he wants because he does have a watch. After they walk away from each other, the first man puts the watch on again. It takes about 5-10 minutes for the policeman to notice that the second one took the watch, so he asks the other if he took it. The other man says absolutely not. He tells the policeman he never took the watch, even though he knew it was his. So both men argue for a while but the policeman finally gets his point across to the first man. So after a little while, the man and his friend return to their building and take off their watches. They go back to the first man’s building and ask him, “How come you took your watch?” The man admits that he was wrong and his friend took it from him. The first man leaves the first building and returns to the second building where his friend calls him and tells him that the policeman was right — that he took the watch. So the friend says to the man, “You can see the difference just by looking at the time on my watch. Take that as a compliment.” So the man takes off his watch and they go back to their first building. The second man says to the first man, “You’re welcome.” So the first man takes off his watch. The second man now stands back and says, “

Why? There is a car rental agency in that town that charges $30/day to rent cars.  The chief administrator pays his agency to rent cars to employees.  An employee that takes his car rental fee must work during the tornado warning.  Which of the following statements applies to this situation?<n>Output: He must work during the evacuation because he is working during the tornado warning.<n><n>Input:A family owns a house and lives in a suburb of town. When tornadoes threaten their house, the family needs to leave the house and move to higher ground as possible.  The family must take the horses with them; they will need them to help them move to higher ground.  What precautions should be taken if the family chooses to leave the horses at the house with their owners?<n>Output:1) There is a car rental facility in a city three miles from the family home, but it charges $30/day, and the family intends to stay in the house during the warning.  Why do they need to get a rental car?  Perhaps they will need to take the horses with them to the car rental facility, but it is unlikely that they will need to.2) Instead of moving their house to higher ground, the family is willing to let the horses stay for the duration of the tornado threat and pay the car rental fee to the car rental agency while they stay.  Why would they take this decision? 3) The family lives just a few miles from the town where the tornado is headed and the house they built is about 10 miles from the highway where the tornado is headed, so the family decides to evacuate the house by car to the other side of town (four towns).  Why do they need a rental car?  They must leave their horses at the house nearby, yet they prefer to leave them with their car owners nearby rather than try to drive the couple of miles to escape the hail/wind/tornado threat on the highway where the storm is headed.  How long will it take to get from the house close to the highway to the area on the other side of town where the car rental facility is? 4) The family lived out by one of the rivers, so the family doesn't need to evacuate their house by car. However, they think that the car rental facility nearby

(1.58 m) x 5 ft. (1 m) footboard with which they can take a deep breath and exhale some of the fumes produced by equipment.  Their breath is then sucked into a straw that extends into a container below the board; the container is then squeezed through a hole in the bottom of the board and into a metal tube that contains more air.  A 1ft. (0.3 m) pipe leads from the container into the wall.  A meter is attached to the wall for measuring the air that is sucked into the tube.  What is the volume of air that is sucked in each minute?  Output: 5.6 cm.<n>Input: The board is 5 feet wide (1.58 m).  The board is 5 ft. (1m) x 5 ft. x 5 ft. (3.13m).  The board extends from the hole to the top of the wall and is 3 ft. (0.91 m) long.<n>Input: Sam is in a 6 ft. (1.98 m) tall tower.  The top of the tower opens out to a small hallway.  Sam is 2 ft.

Choices:  A: leg B: garment C: torso D: body E: road<n>Output:		 He used his own body weight to push his weight off of his shoulder.<n>Using his own body weight, the arm pushed and the chest bent upward, the shoulder pressed the stomach against the roof, the torso moved forward and the knees bent forward and then bent upward.<n>The push and the chest bending and the knees bending and the shoulders pushing resulted in a total resistance of 987 pounds. The total weight was 544 pounds.<n>Thus the final answer is 987<n><n>Input: If the total wind speed is 100 mph, how much force would it take to push a 2 ton car across the country at that speed?  Output: 100 mph is the force needed to push a 2 ton vehicle across the country at 100 mph.<n>The force needed to push a car across country at 100 mph is 3 times the force needed to push it at 20 mph.<n>The force will be about a pound.<n>For purposes of measuring force (1/r), then the force needed to push the car across country at 100mph is<n>100 = 100/r * 2<n>0.2989 = 2 = 4.073<n>(2*3)*4 = 1.921<n>Therefore, 100 mph is the force necessary to push a 2 ton truck carrying a 2 ton car across country at 100 miles per hour, or, for those who do not know, 100 mph = 3 × 4 × 1/r.<n><n>Input: Let a truck carrying four 100-pound boxes cross the country at 100 miles/hour with a wind speed of 90mph.<n>The speed of the wind is 80mph. If we apply a constant speed force of 1 pound of force to the four 100-pound boxes at a speed of 60mph, how much force can the force of that 1 pound of force impart on a 2 ton truck pulling a 200-pound box?<n>Output: The force of 1 pound of constant force on the four 100-pound bags results in a total force of 1 pound.<n>Thus, the force of 1 pound of the constant force is 4 pounds.<n>So the force of 1 pound at 60mph adds up to 4 pounds, which is 8.3 pounds.<n>So the final force of 4 pounds equals 8.3 pounds and the 100-mile-per-hour wind speed equals 9 mph, in other words 2 = 3.5 x 3 x 2.2 = 5% or 7-8% at 90 mph. The total force of 5 pounds is 6 pounds, equivalent to 100

For only $5, you could get two cups of coffee, a soda, and a $1 cigar.  The price reflected the value of the goods you acquired.  The specials were running the entire week.  A dozen people came to the local bar.  Each day, the barman would order 4.25 cups of coffee, 6.75 cans of soda and 12 cigars.  Each day, a woman would order two cups of coffee, 4.25 cans of soda, and 12 cigars.  After two weeks, the barman noticed that his sales had dropped.  The barman attributed the decline largely to the prices he was charging.  He began charging the same price after two more weeks. Before long, his sales increased. How much were they purchasing during these two weeks?<n>Why may this have happened?  Because the two products, coffee and cigars were so cheap that they could not compete with the other food and non-alcoholic beverages sold in the bar.  Thus, most patrons opted to buy other products instead.<n>What is it about the bar's coffee and cigars that causes a customer to drink them more than other products?<n><n>Output:You purchase a bottle of wine two weeks earlier. It costs $8/bottle. You pay $3/bottle. On a Sunday afternoon, you have a few hours to spend with your family. Which three things do you: a)do? b)pay? c)prefer to have with the wine?<n>d)avoid?<n><n>Output:A car salesman calls the dealer's sales department.

Choices:  A: run B: swimming C: calculate things quickly D: fight enemy E: urinate<n>Output:		 Fear is the strongest emotion known to man, which allows you to run faster than a shark but slower than a duck.<n>Since your fear is strong enough to cause your heart to race at 100 beats a minute, you must be capable of exertion.<n>The fastest way for you to exert yourself is for you to swim towards the beach, while avoiding the sharks that are in the water.  The sharks are also capable of swimming extremely fast, so swimming against them is not an effective plan.  If you are the swim king of your ocean, people will notice your strength, and you will be the target of much harassment from others.<n>The second method is much simpler: you will have no fear.  Because you are aware that you are surrounded and there is a possibility that someone could be behind you, you will instinctively move out of the way. If you cannot resist the urge to dash away, then you will run. If you are constantly swimming and trying to evade danger (without fear), you will be in constant danger.  Finally, if you are an animal, you will not be able to move at all due to your fear.  You will become one with the sea as soon as you are submerged.  The only way you will survive is if you are willing to abandon your fear.<n>It takes 3 hours to get from your starting location to your destination. How long will it take you to run the same distance that was swimming?<n><n>Input:An alligator has just been killed in California.  It weighed about 100 pounds and measured about 2 feet long.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:The janitor got his pail out of where? Choices:  A: wishing well B: kitchen C: hardware store D: garage E: utility room<n>Output:		 The pail went to the kitchen.<n>The janitor went to the kitchen.

Then he went back inside and scooped out the washing water.<n>C.  The washing machine needed clean water and water spilled from the pail.<n>D.  A janitor searched the kitchen, found an empty laundry basket, and emptied it of water. Then he went outside, scooped up some water from the pail, and filled the empty laundry basket with wash.<n>So the final results are A > B | C > D | E | E > D<n><n>In the previous example, the janitor did a single trip that was too long for him to complete in one trip, so he returned to a location that was close enough that he could complete the first leg of the trip. When he got out the second leg of the trip and returned to the kitchen, he was unable to find his pail--so he decided on a second trip to a location that was nearer to the kitchen.<n>If he did not follow this pattern, he might have completed more than one leg of the trip.

Three days before the move out date of the first roommate, you need to move out of said apartment and into a room for yourself. So how quickly do you need to move out, in hours?<n>Output: 3 hours<n>You have 5 hours until the start of move out day. Each room has a mattress, a bedspread, an extra blanket, a pillow and a lamp with a 30/30 bulb.<n><n>Input:There are 4 employees. They are paid $500 each. 2 employees work 1 hour and 30 minutes in a company store, the 2 remaining employees work the rest 1 hour and 20 minutes. Employees are paid $350/day for working 1 hour and 30 minutes. A week later, the new employees will be paid $300/day for working the same amount of time in the store working an additional hour and 30 minutes. If the number of employees doubles, the total daily per employee earnings increase to $500. The total per hour earnings increase to $300 if the number of employees halves. The per hour earnings increase to 50 if the number of employees quadruples. On the day a product is sold, there are 15 customers in the store paying $10 each. So the total per hour earnings increase is $20 for the 5 employees working 10 more hours in the store each day ($25/hour each). The total per hour earnings for each store employee, as a group, during the first week increase to $300/hour ($550/week).<n>Input: A business gives you a coupon entitling you to 70% off a product. You spend 4 hours at the store making selections from this offer. Total per hour earnings from the store are (price of coupon, $100/hour x 4 hours/day, 80% of $500/week, or 60 hours/week per person) x $200/week=$100/week. You spend 12 hours shopping in the store, bringing the total per hour earnings to $50. Since the coupons have been reduced from $100/hour down to $25/hour, you make $50 off the $500 you spent. Would you say spending $50/week, or the equivalent of each employee in your company, is the correct amount of time spent in each store?<n>Output: Spending

Choices:  A: believe in god B: pay bills C: group together D: enjoy themselves E: face each other<n>Output:		 What happens in the Bible is that man comes to be saved. The Bible says, "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Therefore be careful" (Mark 16:17, The Message).  And if you are one of the faithful, then you know that you are saved. So this is it. When it comes to personal salvation, we as Christians are called to do more than believe what we believe. We are being held accountable for what we do in God's sight, for Christ's sake. Thus, Christians are expected to act out our faith as much as possible in social interaction. Thus, Christian interaction on a daily basis involves giving of ourselves to all people, and especially to our neighbours. So, when you see a family or friend of yours struggling to make it on their own, that is a Christian giving of ourselves for them. So what is it?<n><n>Input:The person has $1 million, and will need to save $200,000 more over the next year. At the same time, he has to purchase a new car. What is the ideal car and price range to get? Output: This is the vehicle everyone should have to purchase the car of theirs dreams and a lifestyle they can provide themselves. The person should purchase this automobile, and they should do so for under $20,000. If he can get a loan for the remaining $60,000, the car price can be decreased by another $20,000 by paying for only 10% of the automobile's value over the life of the loan.<n>The price of this automobile (for 10% down payment) would be $11,290,000. So total loan cost from car loan would be $11,090,000 * $20,000 * 10% = $50,000. This amount could be put towards down payment of new car and $20,000 to avoid being in debt for the next 10 years while saving money.<n><n>Input:There is a big party coming up, and it would cost $250,000 to have the big party.

Choices:  A: intelligence B: education C: effectiveness D: distress E: a stupid<n>Output:		 The ability to learn can be learned very quickly after a traumatic experience. However, the ability to maintain learning after a traumatic experience is difficult.  The ability to cope with situations on a permanent basis is the result of a lifetime of learning.  If we learned during our childhood, we will learn again.  If we don’t learn, we will die.<n>Suppose a student (age 12 years) is being tested on a memory test.  The test is repeated in different conditions over a period of time.  The first time he is tested in a classroom.  The second time is in a classroom environment but with no one else present.  The third time is in a lecture hall.  The fourth time is in an environment in which more people will be present such as a theater room or a classroom.<n>Suppose the test is twice as difficult as the previous time.  The score is 4 out of 10.  What should occur next?<n>Suppose there is a third person present to score the test.  The student will then be tested in a classroom or an environment in which other people will be present.  The student will test twice as well because every time there is someone else in the room, the student must learn with the rest of the class.<n>What might the effect of the teacher's comments, questions, or other stimulus be on the test?<n>Input: The first test was a classroom task.  The test was twice as difficult as the first test.<n>Output: The increased difficulty of the test makes the test more difficult for the students.<n>Suppose each time a student scores an 8 or 9, he or she will learn something.  Each time a student scores a 4 or 5, the student will learn less and less.<n>Input: The classroom and lecture hall conditions are the same for both tests.<n>Output: The additional time it takes for the classroom and lecture hall tests to be accomplished is equal to the additional time it takes to be able to respond to the teacher’s comments, questions, or stimulus.<n>A teacher can either teach students to learn as quickly as possible.  Or, she can take longer to teach students to learn because she or he fears that the students will learn less if they are given short answer questions than longer questions such as a test.<n>Suppose there is one additional person in the classroom.  The student will show much less behavior during the classroom or lecture hall tests because all of the questions are now taken into consideration.

Before reaching the turnoff road for his office, the gentleman calls out to the pet to be quiet. As the dog gets quiet a moment later, he sees a person about 200 yards away. He reaches into his left chest pocket to pull out his wallet. He begins taking out his wallet when the person, upon spotting the man holding the dog, runs up to the dog and starts feeding it.  The man begins his speech to the person, saying, (He doesn't have a wallet) and the man says, "How's the dog, what's your name."  The dog responds, "My name is Pookie."  The man replies to the person, (You should get a phone number so it's easier to find you) that he's still on his way to the office. The person replies, (My phone number is in my front pocket, under my shirt.)<n>The man continues, "What's your name by the way." and the person replies, (It's not so hard to remember names when you have a dog that's named after you.) The woman's car pulls up beside the two men.  She asks what's going on. The man says, "Well, I was just giving Pookie a feed. He's a bit of an arse hole."  The woman replies, (You mean he likes to be alone?) and the man replies, (No I mean he likes to be left alone.)  They then look out of their respective vehicles at the other people and then the dog begins barking.  The man then says, "Well, Pookie is still up, so it seems to have been worth it to bring him along."  The woman replies that she'd be glad to have it back too, and the man says. "Yeah, I'm always up for food if you're looking for something to do."  The woman replies "Oh no, he's up in the other room.  He isn't allowed anywhere out in the open."  The other man, who has been looking down the road at work, yells out, "What!?" and the two men immediately begin to get out of the car. The man pulls out his gun and starts pointing it at the people that he thinks have taken the dog.  After about a minute the man lets off all the rounds, (No need to be so mean), shoots

He started planting wheat seeds and it sprouted.  At first it was a green seed, but at six weeks, it was a brown seed with tiny green pods.  He took the seed and planted it in the ground.  Within one week it sprouted again, grew green with green pods and leaves, and was ready to harvest.  The farmer told the weather forecaster about this.  The forecaster was surprised that the seeds had sprouted in such a short time.  He thought it was too late but not too cold.  The farmer went home that night, planted the wheat seed and began to plant the rye seeds.  The next day he planted the oats, which sprouted too.  At the four-week mark, the farmer had filled in two rows in the rye and he was just about finished filling in the third row in the wheat.  His neighbors were impressed at how fast the rye grows.  He told them that he had had enough of waiting for rain to start planting the corn.  He wanted to plant right away.  By the five-week mark, the yield had grown so much, that the farmer sold all of his wheat.  He kept all the rye seeds.  He planted it again this fall and again the yield was big.  He sold all the wheat and kept the rye seeds.  At the six-week mark, the rye was completely covered.  When he went to harvest, he could barely lift the spade and the farmer knew that the rye was growing.<n>At the eight-week mark, a forecaster came to the farmer’s house to tell the farmer that there was no more rain and to give him a few suggestions on what crops to plant next season.  The farmer told him that the only crops he wanted to plant next year were  wheat, soybeans, and sunflowers.<n><n>Input: A fisherman brought two pieces of cuttings and one piece grown from his native country into the U.S. The fish he brought from his native country, the carp, is different than any fishing that he or his family has ever experienced before.

Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:Where could you put some olives to prevent them from getting nearby food wet? Choices:  A: eaten B: glassess C: jar D: pizza E: refrigerator<n>Output:		 A.  Olives are not edible and cannot rot because they are in a protective, dry environment.  They can spoil if eaten as soon as they are picked.  Jar foods could rot quickly.  And, refrigerator space is limited.  Glassess are not always edible because they will rot once picked.  Olives are also in a dry and protective environment that protects them from the weather.  Glassess are safe to eat as soon as they are popped.  Pizza is not stored in the refrigerator and does not rot.  Refrigerator space could be limited.<n>Output: B.  You can store food items that you prepare in a room that is insulated from the outside world and where no moisture is permitted.  In this protected room, any food that is stored can be stored safely.  But pizza and pizza oven ovens cannot be stored in a room that is filled with moist air.  It would be a perfect environment for mold and mildew to grow.<n>Output: C.  You can keep food items for a short period of time in a room that is sealed that is only warm air and moisture is allowed to enter the room.  The food will not rot, because it is protected from the weather.  It also stays fresh for longer than just a few days.  If the food is stored for more than a few days, humidity could cause the food to spoil unless placed in a plastic container.  However, a freezer refrigerator box is too cumbersome to store food items that are stored for more than a couple of days.  And it is possible, for small food items that need only a couple of days of storage, there could be problems using a small food container.  If the food goes more than two days, the food may be spoiled.  And, it is also likely for pizza to spoil faster than larger items that might require a day or more of storage.  It might be cheaper to store pizza in a freezer.  D.  You can use food and milk that are fresh and pasteurized.  But most food and milk will spoil if stored for more than a week.  And, meat will spoil quickly in a freezer.  It is usually a better idea to buy frozen food and pasteurized milk than to use a refrigerator to store your food items.<n>Output: D.  You can store canned food or dry goods such as bread, rice, pasta, eggs etc. in a temperature-controlled, insulated cooler with a moisture-free environment and place them

Choices:  A: public building B: tomb C: arena D: large building E: treasure<n>Output:		 The explorers found a central passage much to their delight, but unfortunately it leads straight to a huge cache of stolen artifacts.<n>It is located in the middle of an old cemetery, which gives archaeologists the added advantage of easy access to the old building that was once a tomb, if it turns out it has anything to do with this discovery the thieves will be lucky to miss out on anything.<n>Option A seems to be the likely answer, but the artifacts are extremely valuable<n>Option C seems to be the correct answer, and it is actually the correct answer to the question, but it does not answer any of the other questions.  It appears that the artifacts were meant to be taken to a central location in case archaeologists found any other tombs, and once they did there was a need to hide them from the authorities.  The archaeologist's solution is to hide them under the surface to prevent the thieves from recovering them.  If there were any tomb nearby, the thieves, would likely retrieve the artifacts and bury them somewhere else.<n>The question was posed as a simple two part set of questions, the first part concerned where the artifacts were hidden, and the second part concerned what they were hiding.  Since we only have 2 possible answers and no possible solutions, Option C is the correct answer.  The artifacts are hidden, but they are really going to try to recover them so that there are no other tombs, which means that they actually have a better chance at getting the artifacts than having the answer to the question.<n>The only other answers are Option B or Option C, so Option C is the correct choice.<n><n>Input:Two men wearing suits enter on the bridge.

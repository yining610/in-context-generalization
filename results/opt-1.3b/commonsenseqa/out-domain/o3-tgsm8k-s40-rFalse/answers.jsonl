The ad is to air on two major television news channels and several specialty channels including the BBC, NBC, CNN and KPNW. In order to fund the campaign, the president offers to cut $2,000,000 from NASA's budget. When the budget was proposed, one senator asked why the president could cut the program's budget and NASA's science budget so much. The president said that people were paying a lot for the cost of living and they should be compensated.

{"text": "B\n\nYour brain can not remember past, present, or future memories. Your mind instead has a single function: recall past and present actions. When you recall to date, your brain does not remember the action; only the action that created the future. By choosing actions now and remembering them later, you can focus your memory to recall the information necessary for you to plan and do your future activities. If you do this, it's easy to tell yourself future plans without remembering them later. When you recall an action that happened 6 months ago, you're more likely to remember all of its actions if you'll recall some of its actions.\n\nI want to tell you about a problem that you are facing. I want to tell you the reason behind this problem. I want to know about the problem and about you, what makes you different and a better candidate to solve that particular problem. These all seem like great ideas to me. However, do you follow me on all of these? If you aren't paying attention to the idea or the person, then you aren't paying attention. I have only told you three simple things for this problem. The important thing is to keep the task brief, to keep it simple, and to always be paying attention. Most importantly, you need to give the answer to the question and have the answer ready. Remember to answer the question by stating the answer and giving a few details. It could take as little as three minutes to be done, or it could take as long as half an hour, or it could take all day. This is what makes the assignment interesting and what makes it challenging. It's always a good idea to break the task into small parts rather than taking on too much at once. This allows you to pay attention to your brain but it also allows the brain to focus.\n\nYou are a professor that has the opportunity to give lectures on a wide variety of subjects. One of your topics in lecture would be on the topic of \"What is a successful individual?\" It would be your chance to talk about why the person is successful at what they do. You will be able to research or learn something about every subject your university offers, and you will have a list of questions that you could use for that subject. You can talk to students about what you have learned from your research or learn a little different viewpoint to the subject that would have been taught in class.

We need to add them out, add up, subtract them, multiply them, and divide them by the 5 dogs because we have 2.1 dogs total. I took 8 Doberman, divided them by three, and took the result. From there I took the three minus the seven plus seven. That gives the number of dogs to divide by, and from there we add up three. As soon as we have three we multiply the two to get 11. This multiplication would add up to 13, so we add our 10. That gives us the number of Dobermans. Now add up all the Rottweilers. Since there are three in the class, plus seven dogs, we divide a Rottweiler by one dog, and multiply the result by 10. Since the number of dogs is ten Rottweiler that is 1.2dogs. The answer to the question of how many dogs is a total of 15 dogs.\nOutput: D\n\nInput:The person who can count the number of Dobermann will get 3 first on Tuesday. The first Doberman can count his own dog. The second can count dogs 2-5. The second can count three dogs. The second can count four dogs. The first can count six dogs.

The answer, if it is not written as three times the quantity of plants used by the caterpillars, is less.  If it cannot be written as 3 times the quantity of plant matter, it is more.  If three times the quantity of plant material is written, then it is 2.5 times.

The total wage is $12.50 an hour. The next day, the farm is given $13 worth of wheat, which equates to $1.25 per 1 pound of wheat. If we subtract 1.25 from the first men\u2019s wages, the total of $12.50 is also subtracted from the total of $15.50, so we get $12 and $15.50, or $12.50 and $15.50. The total wage the week before was $12.50 anhour, so we get $13 an hour the week before the wheat was given to the farm. If, on the third day, on December 21st, the farm was given some cash that was higher than what the men had been given the previous week, the total net wage is $13.25, the difference between net or cash wages and wage wages being 1.25. The amount the farm gets from the wheat is 1.25 times the normal wage, so $13.50.\nOutput: B\n\nQuestion is written at the top of the page; answer must be given in the caption box\n\nInput: Ten different animals must live in ten different cities of North America.

{"text": "B\n\nOutput:When the teacher's name is called, if you hear the teacher's name, and do not have to answer the question, answer the question.  The answer is C, so you should not answer.  You should not answer the question based on what might be the teacher's name.  You should answer the question based on something that is true or false about the person.  To answer based on what might be is false; to answer based on what is true or false is true.  Answer the questions as you would answer them if they were in a conversation with themselves.  Do not tell the person what your answer will be before you answer it.  When answering the question based on what is true, do not ask the other person their opinion on the issue.  Instead, just say what you just said and answer as you would.  Answer any question that uses a word that is not true.  For example, if someone says, \"what's your opinion?\"  And then \"What I am going to say is this:\" instead of \"What I am going say is this:\" it is called a \"word salad\"; when you answer \"word salad\" make sure not to answer the question based on the word \"word salad\".  When the teacher's name is announced, do not answer the question.  Just say, \"I'm not answering your questions.  I don't wanna.\"  You should say this because the teacher must choose something that is true or not true in order to answer the question.  If the teacher is asking a question based on what might not be true, then you can explain to the teacher what might be true or false; you can then answer the question based on that.  If you are asking a question based on the what is true or false principle, you have the right to explain why you answer that way.\nIf you ask someone a question on your turn, just answer the question without explaining your answer to the teacher.  If you do this on your turn you will get an A in the class.  If someone who does this gets an A, ask the teacher for his or her explanation; the teacher will then probably explain why he or she answers the way he or she does; you should then ask your teacher the same question, but instead of saying, \"What I am going is this,\" ask him or her if \"What I am going\" is true or false.  When someone else answers \"What I am going,\" you should", "answer": "D: hat rack"}

After the first six months free, your monthly fee will depend on the amount of air time you\u2019ve used with the company over the six months you\u2019ve been subscribed to DTV. The amount of air time you used with DTV determines your monthly cost. The amount of airtime you used over the six months you subscribe to also determines if you have a refundable deposit (i.e. an automatic credit) or a nonrefundable deposit (i. e. a credit card charge back). For unlimited viewing, you have a refundable automatic deposit and a nonrefundable charge back on your payment if you cancel your subscription after the first six months. For unlimited viewing for the first six months of the plan, a refundable automatic deposit is applied to all monthly payments and no charge backs are applied. Otherwise, you\u2019ve only paid a nonrefundable fee if you cancel your subscription within, and if you receive billing information that shows one charge back, or if you have a refund date within your subscription, within the first six months of your subscription. For the two plans that allow you to pay without a payment plan, a refundable charge back is applied to all monthly fees regardless of the amount of air time or the validity of your subscription. For your first six months, your refundable automatic deposit is $25 regardless of the amount of unlimited usage. If you cancel your subscription during the first six months after the first six months free and receive billing information that shows only one charge back, this means that you have to pay $25 regardless of the number of months you\u2019ve used your plan.

If you have a subscription after the first six or 12 months after the first six, you\u2019ve paid $25 for every month you\u2019ve used the plan regardless of the number of times you cancel the plan. Once you\u2019ve paid for the first six months, you do not have to pay for this plan again until your next renewal date.

How difficult (1) is it to train and (2) how long can it take to train him to do a task?\nOutput: 2 (10 minutes each) (one hour total)\n\nAnswer (4) : The initial number has to be 1 as this is the first \"random number\" generated by the random number generator.\nThe initial number has to be less than 31, or you will end up playing two number guessing games and then two number guessing games and have to decide which number is higher at the end. The\ninitial number has to be 31, less than 10 or you will have the same number each time. So the initial number is always 10 when it comes up. But we can do better than that if we have\njust 30 and start playing. Now we don't have a random number generator. Instead we have to pick 30 random numbers, take the first 10 numbers and then pick the last 5 numbers in\nbetween. So now the first 5 random numbers each comes up twice.\nWith just 30 numbers we can get up to 31, but we will have 5 numbers at a time, so that when we get to 10, there will be 3 more numbers.\n\nOutput: We just keep selecting random numbers, each time taking the first number and then taking the second. So if we get one random number, then we take 1 and then take 7.\nEach time we get more number then 9, if our number is 9. We take 9 and then take 7. Then we take 9 and then take 5. 9. 10", "answer": "E: internet sites"}

You've helped many of my students.\nI think there are three ways to answer question 8.\n1) 50 is less than 100 so the difference between 75 and 90 is less than that = 50, or more than 40.

That makes the correct answer 50 but not 20.\n3) If it were 20 and it was already a correct answer then, because it has already been answered, the answer should have been 26, or more if 50 is less than 80, or more if 80 is not less than 4, or more than 1, and/or more than 100 (if there is 50, and 40 is not less than one, and 60 is not less than 10).

The heat of your blood in your body increases rapidly with exertion. The cold of the outside air in the morning does not increase or decrease compared to the heat of your blood in the early morning. For example, if you walked 5 miles during a 15 minute period this morning, from your home to work, the warmest part of your body, your arms, would be hot to the touch. Yet those same arms would be the coldest part of your body come the afternoon when you walked 8 miles of the same distance. The blood that moves faster than the heat of the blood (i.e. heart rate) would be warm and the blood that moves slower than the heart rate would be cool. This is due to the flow of blood, and is a general idea of temperature and physiology. A common misconception that is not taught in biology is that you can increase or decrease the temperature of your skin because the blood is warmer, or cooler, at any specific temperature. Instead of temperature, the temperature of your skin is primarily a function of the flow and conductance of the blood that transports it. This concept is part of why the skin of a baby (or human) is warmer than the skin of a baby during summer, and cooler in winter.", "answer": "E: chemistry lab"}

I replied that my plan didn't work because I didn't think we had enough information about the subject.  He replied that that wasn't very true because I had included a good amount of detail.  I said that he was correct, but that even so it would still be harder to get the required answers if I was forced to guess.  He said that he would be surprised about how much I knew.  I responded that I am not surprised at all.  He responded that he would also be surprised about how many things I had already failed to memorize.  After another question, I then said that I was surprised that he knew how much I knew about him and school in general.\nWe discussed some vocabulary that I did know by name.  I pointed out that some of those words have words that sound familiar to me and some of those words had never even been spoken to me before.  He said that I sounded like a good student.  He said that now that he knows how long it was and how many questions we had, that I would need to memorize all the answers.  I said that my problem is not memory.  He said that was true because all I needed to do was find a page to read from and get the answer, which is how he had done it.  He said that getting a student to remember all the answers to a book was one of the hardest things to do in school.\nI am beginning to believe that the reason why students like me are chosen to teach a class and the reason behind my passing grade is because of my ability to answer these questions or have memorized the answers.

{"text": "59\n\nA table: It is usually easier for waiters to set than to handle.  If you think the wait tables will sit directly at the table, the waiter cannot touch the table with the fork and spoon or a knife. When you place food on the table with two hands at least the servers will see this.  When you drop food at the table it creates an easy surface for the waiter to serve himself.  The dish at the table can be divided into smaller plates before service.\nServe dinner: Food on the table can be served in small portions. The waiter cannot hold the serving utensils in each hand like he does at a table.  When serving the meal, the tablecloth can be folded to make it easier to service the large plate.\nSet table: At a busy place the waiter does not usually set a table the first time. He has much quicker service to do. When a table is ordered for a busy night, the waiter puts the utensils, plate and napkins before the dinner plates.  You will see him put the serving papers on a sideboard.  Then he carries each plate, napkin and utensil to the place card holder at the end of the service. He uses a tray with plates, napkins and the napkins.  If the table is not too crowded, the waiter will go from table to table to serve customers. He has one more place to go when he is finished serving at a table.\nFeed the dogs: The servers will put the table setting up in advance.  A waiter can do the same thing for the dogs.  A waiting list can be set up prior to service.  Once the waiting list is completed he will have to hold onto this new food service.  Even if service does not come through immediately, the waiter can still prepare new food.\n\nA tray: If you serve some food on a tray you may be able to move away from the table.  The waiter can also stand in between the tables to take the tray away from the customer.\nFold a tablecloth at end of service:  This is an easy way to save time.  The waiter does not need to set up the tablecloth any further with a fork and spoon if he is to carry off some food before service.  It can be kept down or folded, either way, to use the same number of utensils.\nTable clothes: If you serve food on a small round tray, it can be", "answer": "E: present bill"}

She writes the number of pencils in her left hand on her ruler, the number of pens in her right hand on the ruler, and how many rulers she has left in her box. She then writes the number of pencil in her left hand. In her right hand, she writes what her left hand could write if she did write with one pencil. After she has written six pencils, she writes with two pencils. On the following page, she will write with the two pencil. She repeats this several times and uses the first pencil only on her left hand to estimate how long it will take to write the number 6 on the number 6 pen, and to estimate how much pen she needs to use to write the number 6 pen. What she writes is correct, but it will take her longer to write the number 6 than it would to write the other number on the pencils she is holding or writing with two pencils: 6 or 2. She writes the number 6 with two pencils, and the time it will take is a bit under 2 hours. On the next page, she may use her other pencil to estimate how long it would be to write 6 on a second pencil. So on page seven, if she used her third pencil she would be able to write the 6 pen correctly, and she would not need to write the other number so many times. In page eight, she uses her third pencil again. She estimates how long it would take to write the 5, and how many pens she will need on the other side. Again, on page nine, she decides that she is going to use her first pencil, and that it will take her less than one hour to write 6 on the 6 pencil.\nOutput: 5 out of 6 are right. What is the explanation?\nOutput: She uses the left and right ends of each pencil to estimate what amount of time it would take to write 6 on each pencil.

The first pencil and both of the second and the third pencil will also take 2 hours, and the fourth pencil will be 3 hours.

An egg is one with a white interior. \"Toothpicks\", on the other hand, are made of soft material. How does an egg fall on another shell? (Answer the question)\nAnswer: An egg with a white interior falls, and the eggshell becomes larger while it falls.\nAnswer: If an egg is one with a light tan interior, the color does not turn to black for the tan interior.

If there is no demand for any product, then the producer does not produce a product. The quantity of a good in a market determines how much a consumer will pay to obtain it by the supply of the market or equilibrium. If there is no market demand for any product in the production and sale of the product then the producer does not provide the product. If there is a market demand for a product then the producer has produced the product but there is no demand for, or supply of, the product in the market. In the production and sale of a product if there is no market demand then the producer does not supply the product whereas if there is a market demand then the product producer has satisfied the demand causing a shortage which is not met by the consumer. This can be compared to taking a pill that helps you get some flu-like symptoms or a pill that cures your flu-like symptoms. The pills are not supplied in the market, not the market of the production or sale of the pills but the market of the consumer, i.e. the demand for a pill or the shortage of supply of a pill. As this definition of the word \"doctors\" is a very broad one it is hard to say what a \"doctors\" is exactly. The dictionary definition of the word \"doctor\" is \"A trained physician employed either as an employee of a hospital or medical practice.\" This makes sense. If you are a doctor, and there is a big shortage of doctors in the United States, does that mean that you \"cure\" patients", "answer": "C: dangerous"}

The second way started when he was eight years old with a teacher in a room.  When the teacher told him to put his hands on the desk and he put the right hand on the desk, it was a simple arithmetic calculation and he never missed a day. When his teacher left he tried the left hand and it worked fine. He tried the right hand and the teacher helped him. Then the teacher left and Henry took charge of the school. During the first day Henry decided to try the right hand again by putting his hands on the desk. This time it was a mess and he got the wrong number. After that Henry became very curious and started asking the teacher why he would make him do something wrong so often. When the teacher told him it was very easy to do, he did it again and this worked for days. By the end of the month Henry realized he had a knack for this trick. He also realized that it was probably the only way he could learn to add.  On the second day of the month the teacher told Henry every child could do this trick. Henry was very excited because it was something he could count on doing every day in school.  When Henry and his teacher got to the end of the two days Henry realized he had learned a new way. Now every child could count on his teacher to count the days for him.  The teacher left the school for the night, leaving Henry alone in the room with the two clocks. In those two weeks, Henry learned to count on his teacher to leave the room and count days for him.\n\nInput:How do you think that the two students in the same grade", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

We may not think that we can control a population just by having more education of the population, however we would be mistaken. There is a way to change the way we raise the quality of the population, however to do this education is not enough. A successful community must be a community first and foremost. The education may play a small role, however it is still just a tool for influencing a community's mindset; the real key will always be the way the community is built. I believe that to really make a great community is to build a truly community centered approach of education. As for country, a successful country may not just be the nation but the people as well. As for the state, I would say that the state is at a lower level than the federal government. I realize that the separation of powers has its limits and that all of our decisions are governed by the people of our state, but I cannot deny that the state has a greater degree of control over us and should be respected.\n\nAs for community, I believe a successful community is based on a strong community built on a solid foundation. The foundation of our community must be based on trust, respect, community and good ideas. Once we realize that we are a community we must know that everyone is needed and no one can be left out.\n\nQ3:", "answer": "D: feel happy"}

Secondly, I can't help but notice that your daughter's vocabulary is the same as my daughter's. If you'll excuse the pun of \"tough luck\" at 4, that makes you an old lady. But you could be the new favorite of your daughter's preschool teacher. Hmmm.\nThen again, maybe being a part of The Force is less exciting than her childhood dreams of being a ninja.

{"text": "A, B, C, E,  F\n\nThe answer is B. What do you think the point is of competing?\n\nHow to Study for the SAT\n\nRemember that SAT scores are based on how well you answer the questions. It is important that you be clear about the way you are going to answer the SAT.\n\nTo study for SAT, we recommend taking 3 hours of SAT preparation classes online or a SAT tutor.\n\nHow Important is Reading?\n\nReading is only half of the content of the SAT.\n\nWhile reading for the SAT, you can use two main skills; your memory and mental processing skills. Memorization is the best technique for learning.\n\nWhen you get a question wrong, the most efficient technique is to take a quick look at your answer. Do you remember what was on that page, and what is the answer you have just written down. You should take an effort to make sure that you are sure of yourself.\n\nIn this case, memory is the most important practice technique. Once you have memorized the answer, review the passages you have previously seen.\n\nOn most college entrance exams, they give you the answers after you turn in pages of notes. If you can't review the passages from your notes, you must ask your SAT tutor. It is also important to learn the format. In high school if we want to discuss the passage the correct way, we would have to memorize the format of each passage. How important is it to learn the format of the passages?\n\nOn SAT, in the first 5 minutes you only need to discuss the passage and find the answer. You need to start reviewing passages and doing work while your time in the test is limited.\n\nHow Important Is Critical Reading?\n\nCritical Reading is extremely important.\n\nCritical reading is also called an interpretation, a synthesis or an evaluation. It combines the verbal, pictorial, and spatial abilities needed to decipher an author's intent. It takes some practice for you to master. In high school you may already be using this technique, or you can use other techniques, such as summarizing passages and summarizing your readings.\n\nWhen you see important words in a text read through all the passages that contain it. Does the text have a new name? Often times, yes. In the old version you might miss it. If you can't find the word in a passage, review all the passages that contain the word.\n\nYou want an essay", "answer": "A: pressure"}

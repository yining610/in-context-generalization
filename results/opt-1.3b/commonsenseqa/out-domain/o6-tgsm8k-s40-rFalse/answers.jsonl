The line stretches for 400 yards from a power generating station into the woods.  If a 100-foot wide sugar plume moves across the 500-yard line, the \"sugar plume' will cut the line in a third, cutting it in two thirds, and then in half.  At the same time, the line will become unstable, with three sections swaying relative to one another and then swaying back and forth on their own.  The point is not that the \"sugar plumes\" aren't dangerous.  The point is that they are less dangerous than the regular swaying of the line that precedes them.  In fact, the line will probably never sway so much that it will cause damage, though it almost never stays in one place more than a second or two.

{"text": "A, E, D, F, G, H\n\nInput: The two largest cities in the United States, San Francisco and Los Angeles, have an average temperature of 80 degrees year round.  They are in the same state, California.  The average rainfall is 523 gallons a day for five hundred and sixty-five days a year.  A storm will come along later this month, and the water in the bay will rise to its highest level in two hundred, five hundred and twenty-eight years.   How high will the water rise?\nOutput:  6 feet, 4 inches\n\nThis is a very long question (and possibly a little unclear), but I believe it's easy enough. The first thing to answer about the water elevation is how much higher it would go, according to the time scale. For example, if it's 40\" higher (or more) by late this month, then the waves at the beach would be more than 5\" high for the first 6 hours of the storm--the same size as a normal high for that time frame. So 6\" high waves at the beach in normal weather, and 10\" high waves at 9:00 AM on a Sunday morning (for the same time period) is the answer.\n\nAnother thing to think about with the height of the waves depends on when they hit the beach. If the waves aren't hitting directly, they are going to the water. If the waves are hitting directly, then they are also going to the water. In that case, the height of the waves is going to be higher if the waves hit right as the storm is rolling in. So if you see waves near the end of the water (or even earlier), those waves are going to be more than 6 feet high.\n\nYou may also notice a little bit of ambiguity because there are two ways the question should be framed:  1) \"how much water higher the storm is compared to the water elevation above water\"  and  2)  \"How high the storm is compared to how much water elevation above sea level above the water\"", "answer": "B: melting"}

He took it out of his mouth.  During the phone call, his wife said, \"take it out of your mouth\"?  In order for there to be an answer, one must think about his wife's question, \"take it out your mouth\". After the call that day, Dr. Banks threw the toothbrush in the closet, and took a shower. Dr. Banks then washed his skin, and decided to apply the toothbrush to his head. After applying the toothbrush to his skin, Dr. Banks then looked at it again, and was struck by the fact that his teeth looked really dry, and that he could see that the toothbrush was still in his mouth. Dr. Banks took the toothbrush out of the shower, and put the piece of toothbrush in his mouth. He put the toothbrush in his mouth for five seconds, and then took it out of his teeth and put it back in the bowl. Dr. Banks proceeded to repeat this technique for an additional fifteen seconds--then he washed his skin again, and continued the procedure for one more wash and dry.

The more difficult the writer, the higher the intelligence level.  Word knowledge is assessed by how well the words are spelled and the speed at which the reader picks out words.  The more difficult, the higher your intelligence level.  If you know how to spell \u201ccough\u201d correctly, you are almost sure to be able to spell correctly others.\n\nMemory\n\nMemory is assessed through the ability to recall and retain data from a short span in time.  For example, memory cannot remember information for long periods of time, but it can memorize it.\n\nRecall and retention abilities depend more on the amount of information learned in school and practiced in the short time remaining in a meeting or conversation.

If he brings the cattle to the milkers, he pays 8d per cow, and then he pays her $100 per calf.  If he sends the cattle to a milker who charges him $40 per calf, and pays her $100 per head,  he profits $200 per cow. On the other hand, if he lets the cattle languish, they produce 50-60% less milk than he intended.  If he only milks the calves he intended, he loses money at $40 per calf.  Since he pays $100 for each head in a cow, and $40 for each calf in a calf, he is losing $10 per head at $40 each.  He wants to milk every one of those calves,  he must milk 830 cows.  Since they produce 50% less milk than intended, he must milk 940 cows.  The cows must be free, or he loses thousands of dollars.

If the shoe is 5 inches wide, 4 inches high, and 2 inches thick, and the man pays $90 for each pair, and $35 for each pair he bought with the dollars that he returned, he will have paid for 4 pairs of 5 inch shoes.  If he pays $60 each, he will pay for 2 pairs of 4 inch shoes.  The fifth pair costs $40, which will be the cost of the shoe he did not return.

A perfect example is that of the blind test presented in this book.  If the blind test were too difficult, the dog would tend to ignore the challenge.  Instead, the dog must be asked to perform at a very rapid pace, often within less than a second.  If the dog is slowed down, it will become confused, or the test will fail.  This is very similar to the test that a human who is at rest and not able to see objects moves much more slowly than a human who can see them.  As soon as the dog is able to see objects, the reaction time must increase exponentially.  When learning new things, a dog must go slowly and carefully in order to do all the steps correctly.  It is essential for the dog and the person being tested to build up to each part of the test gradually.  An important thing to remember is that when a dog performs any task, this means that it is also learning to perform the task better and better.", "answer": "E: university"}

I assume that they can't take you out because they would lose a significant chunk of enrollment for a class with a 5 class load.  Or might they only let you take a course if it's above 5 credits?

In July there have been 30 deaths of patients in the hospital. In October there are 14 deaths. If the number of deaths were evenly distributed throughout the year then the total number of deaths would be 16.

The hospital is making $14,400 per patient per year.\nOutput: 32.00  is the total cost of all the patients in the hospital plus the income from the medical insurance.  Because only 865 patients died, the hospital's total income was $3660.00 dollars.  So the total cost of patients was $9500.00.\n\nInput: This is a 1-minute question.

Students are asked to pick two of the three questions in the following way:  Ask them to pick one of the three questions A, C, or B.  If they pick B, tell them to tell students A the same thing.  If they pick C, tell them to tell the same thing to students D, E, or F.  If they pick A or C, tell students D and E the same thing.   If they pick B and say something like \"I don't feel safe in this situation\" or \"I feel uncomfortable\", you now have them thinking about their actions throughout the day.  You can then have them talk to you about how they behaved, what they saw at dinner, or what they did before lunch.  You can then ask them to pick what they think they can do about what happened to make themselves feel better.  You can then discuss how you will help them improve some of their actions, how you will hold them accountable, or how you will help them help themselves feel better.\nI think that it would be awesome to have a way that allows us to get the students to think about why they acted as they did.\n\nI would be interested (as the teacher, not the kids) if students have their own websites, or ways of getting this lesson plan across.\n\nThanks,\nJill\n\nFrom: \"Jill Gabel\" <jill@jillgabel.com>\nTo: \"Nathan Bieler (E-mail)\" <nathanbieler@yahoo.com>, \"Nathan Bielner\" <nathanbielernetwork@yahoo.com>,\n\"Nathan Bieler\" <nathanbuelernetwork@yahoo    <mailto:nathan.bieler@yahoo       >, \"Jill Gabel (E-mail)\"\n<jill@jill\n\nDate: Thu, 25 Jul 2002 18:22:51 -0500\nSubject: Doberman puppies\n\nI have the question of puppies.

Each day a dog is put up for adoption, the breeder gives us 3 puppies to give away for free. If we have bought 2 puppies from the breeder and 2 puppies from the petstore, then we would pay $950 for the puppies from the breeder.

Your prompt:\nMy Dear Old Friend.\n\nInput: We used to go into the mountains of Italy to try to see the Colosseum. When we first came to Rome, we were very adventurous. We wanted to see the Colosso, so we climbed up to the top of a large hill and stood at the top of that hill, looking down on the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. I remember looking down on the Colusso, it was huge. When I first looked down, my friends and I felt as if we were in a film. We could see the entire city and even the Vatican from where we stood up there. My father and I always joked about the Colosso, but we never actually paid attention to what was going on inside the Colosso. We had a lot of fun that day. That afternoon, we went to see the Colosco, which was located outside of Rome, and we were completely dumbstruck when we got there. We were told that we had to get tickets to take a train ride to the top of the hill and from there we could see the Colosso. My father and I did not have any money to buy tickets for the train, so we simply bought tickets with the money we had in our pocket. We took the train from the town back to Rome via train, and then, from our bus, we took the metro to the top of the Colosso. When we arrived at the top of the hill, we were literally blown away by the sheer size of the Colosso and the entire city of Rome, even though we had never been up anything in that part of the world. My father and I both thought that the Colosso was the most impressive thing that Rome had to offer. My dad and I had very little money at the time, but every penny we earned, we saved for the next trip to Rome. That trip never came. When the time came for us to go home, I decided I would take my dad to Italy, because I really wanted to go to the Colosso again. We made that trip, but we arrived in Italy in June, so the Colosso was already open. That was the last time we ever made the trip to Rome.\n\nInput:  When you go to", "answer": "A: airplane"}

What do teachers like the grade-schooler and high school student learn from this math problem?\nAnswer:   It is impossible.\n\nAnswer: The value \"2\" is 2, even if we use the most simple form possible. That is, 2 + 4 = 8, because a power of 2 is 2.  2 + 13 + 10 = 25, because a power of 6 is 6 - 2, because 2 + 4 = 8. Since we are adding, we get 10 > 20, which then means that when we get to the powers of 10 (10 + 20) + 20, we get 5.  If 5 \u00d7 10 = 27, but 5 \u00d7 20 is 27, then 5 \u00d7 10 = 30 + 27 = 63.\n\nQuestion 13 asks for the distance from New York to Boston.

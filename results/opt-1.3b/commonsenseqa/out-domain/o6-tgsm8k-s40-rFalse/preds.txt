When he gets to his office he sees the following sign: "Fred's House" The only other Freds in town are in the office, Fred I and Fred II. Fred I's sign, "Fred's Office," bears the same message.  Fred I knows that the people at Fred's House think the only office worth having is that one right there, but Fred II is working with him. Fred II's office isn't big enough for Fred I's office, so Fred II comes into Fred I's office and opens his drawer, revealing an envelope addressed to "Fred's House." Fred II tells all of his colleagues and his boss - "You will never guess what's in this envelope!" Fred II asks his boss what's in the envelope before Fred I can answer. "This isn't about Fred's House." "Oh yes it is! In it is Fred's secret formula." Fred II then asks, "You have it in the envelope?" "You'll have to send Fred III to retrieve it." "Fred III?"  Fred II pulls Fred III's photo. "Fred III is in the office." Fred III is at his desk, so Fred II leaves the envelope with Frederick I. As Fred III was on a bus at the time, he isn't home to accept it.  Fred II is worried that Fred III will find Fred's secret formula on his phone when he gets back to Fred's House, so Fred I tells Fred III that Fred's secret formula is in the envelope. Fred III then hands Fred II the envelope. When Fred II sees the envelope, he doesn't recognize it. He opens the envelope. "Your secret formula, with all the clues we gave you, is right there, right there, right there," Fred I says with great excitement. "I'm sorry we didn't give it to you sooner, Fred..." Fred II goes into shock, as Fred I points to the right envelope with the clue, and says, "Right there in the middle. It's on a white sheet of paper." He opens it, and inside there is the answer to all the possible questions on the clue, and he can't believe that. He pulls Fred IV off the page of the paper, and gives it to Fred II, and says, "That's it!"

The line stretches for 400 yards from a power generating station into the woods.  If a 100-foot wide sugar plume moves across the 500-yard line, the "sugar plume' will cut the line in a third, cutting it in two thirds, and then in half.  At the same time, the line will become unstable, with three sections swaying relative to one another and then swaying back and forth on their own.  The point is not that the "sugar plumes" aren't dangerous.  The point is that they are less dangerous than the regular swaying of the line that precedes them.  In fact, the line will probably never sway so much that it will cause damage, though it almost never stays in one place more than a second or two.  The whole point is to prevent damage more effectively than merely reinforcing the line that would have been damaged anyway.<n>Input: "A" for Car, "B" for Bus, "C" for Car, "D" for Bus<n>Output: "D"<n><n>Input: The "sugar plume"'s first "drop" cuts the power lines in half in the first 10 feet, then it "stops" moving, and after another 10 seconds it "stops" at a point where the line is about 20 feet wide.

You can see on the side of all the cars a small black check mark. You can write down the license number of a vehicle with either a letter/number combination or the two letters in "1."  You will see that of the 3 million vehicles with a license plate number "1," 2.3 million have two letters in either the two letter combo or the first letter of the two letter combo and the other "1."  The remaining 728,000 vehicles have one letter/number combination.  The odds you will see "1" on any given number of vehicles in the above list are 6.6 out of a billion.  The odds of seeing a "1" letter on any given vehicle number are 1 out of 1 billion.  The odds are 1/3 million for the latter.  Therefore, the chances that you will get a "1" letter letter on a car number above 728,000 are 1 out of 3.66.  However, the odds you will get a number above 728,300 are 2.6 out of a trillion. The odds of getting a number above 728.33 are 1 in a trillion.  The odds are greater than what you would expect.

There was a short line to the left of the check-out lane.

There were only three cashiers in that line at that time, but one would usually be able to wait just one person in the line.

They are in the same state, California.  The average rainfall is 523 gallons a day for five hundred and sixty-five days a year.  A storm will come along later this month, and the water in the bay will rise to its highest level in two hundred, five hundred and twenty-eight years.   How high will the water rise?<n>Output:  6 feet, 4 inches<n><n>This is a very long question (and possibly a little unclear), but I believe it's easy enough. The first thing to answer about the water elevation is how much higher it would go, according to the time scale. For example, if it's 40" higher (or more) by late this month, then the waves at the beach would be more than 5" high for the first 6 hours of the storm--the same size as a normal high for that time frame. So 6" high waves at the beach in normal weather, and 10" high waves at 9:00 AM on a Sunday morning (for the same time period) is the answer.<n><n>Another thing to think about with the height of the waves depends on when they hit the beach. If the waves aren't hitting directly, they are going to the water. If the waves are hitting directly, then they are also going to the water. In that case, the height of the waves is going to be higher if the waves hit right as the storm is rolling in. So if you see waves near the end of the water (or even earlier), those waves are going to be more than 6 feet high.<n><n>You may also notice a little bit of ambiguity because there are two ways the question should be framed:  1) "how much water higher the storm is compared to the water elevation above water"  and  2)  "How high the storm is compared to how much water elevation above sea level above the water"

He had been playing baseball on Sunday, and cut off the tip of his toothbrush, so he could keep playing.  During a phone call with his wife, his wife told him to take the toothbrush out of his mouth. He took it out of his mouth.  During the phone call, his wife said, "take it out of your mouth"?  In order for there to be an answer, one must think about his wife's question, "take it out your mouth". After the call that day, Dr. Banks threw the toothbrush in the closet, and took a shower. Dr. Banks then washed his skin, and decided to apply the toothbrush to his head. After applying the toothbrush to his skin, Dr. Banks then looked at it again, and was struck by the fact that his teeth looked really dry, and that he could see that the toothbrush was still in his mouth. Dr. Banks took the toothbrush out of the shower, and put the piece of toothbrush in his mouth. He put the toothbrush in his mouth for five seconds, and then took it out of his teeth and put it back in the bowl.

She asked John to work on a project to help out his friend Paul.  The same thing is being done this week by a company that John works with that needs his help on a project.  However, the client of the former project wanted to see John's reaction to a particular request that John makes to his client from his friend.  These two situations are quite similar and have occurred very infrequently, and require a fairly rapid response.  This week, the problem seems easier because John is only dealing with the second project - not the first.  However, if the first project is the client's company, the client could theoretically ask for a reaction from John if he has no previous knowledge of the client.  The same situation would require John's reaction if the request were from Bill.  The second situation is the biggest and most complex in some ways, and more interesting.<n><n>Input: To answer the following multiple choice question, think of the following as possible answers:<n>Input: 1) An employer is to blame for losing his employee. 1) A boss is an integral part of his or her employee's success. 1) A manager must learn to manage effectively. 1) We have come to depend on a person.<n>Output: 3<n><n>Input: A woman goes to Wal-Mart with two children.

They all start with the letter U. The first three letters are all the same and together they spell the state abbreviation: U. The letter Y is an extension of the W, it is therefore an abbreviation of the W, that way the abbreviation U Y W would be the equivalent of the U on the end of “W”: W U Y W. The next letter is the letter G, in this case an abbreviated form of the state abbreviation: G. Therefore: U Y G W. The next letter in this alphabet is B, the abbreviation of the country abbreviation (Y). Therefore: U B Y U. The next letter is T, the abbreviation of a letter: T U T. Thus: U B T U T. The next letter in the alphabet is R, the abbreviation of an alphabet letter: R U R. Therefore: U B R U T R. The next letter in line is R, the same as “R” except that it doesn’t need to start with the letter R. Therefore: U R T U R.

He has two $5 milking stalls, built for 800-pound calves (400 head). He has a bull in each stall.  If he brings the cattle to the milkers, he pays 8d per cow, and then he pays her $100 per calf.  If he sends the cattle to a milker who charges him $40 per calf, and pays her $100 per head,  he profits $200 per cow. On the other hand, if he lets the cattle languish, they produce 50-60% less milk than he intended.  If he only milks the calves he intended, he loses money at $40 per calf.  Since he pays $100 for each head in a cow, and $40 for each calf in a calf, he is losing $10 per head at $40 each.  He wants to milk every one of those calves,  he must milk 830 cows.  Since they produce 50% less milk than intended, he must milk 940 cows.  The cows must be free, or he loses thousands of dollars.  So which option provides a better profit?<n>Output: B<n><n>Input:  There are 5 pairs in a house, and a man owns 3 of them.  The man gives each pair of shoes a new rubber sole for Christmas.  If the shoes cost $100 each to buy, the man should return the money he gave the pairs away, to his friends.  If they cost $10 each to buy, and the man will then be able to afford the 5 pairs he really wanted.  If he does not return the money, he may end up with the 5 pairs he really wants.  Or he will be forced to buy them for $200 each, even though he really wanted only 3 pairs.  If the shoe is 5 inches wide, 4 inches high, and 2 inches thick, and the man pays $90 for each pair, and $35 for each pair he bought with the dollars that he returned, he will have paid for 4 pairs of 5 inch shoes.  If he pays $60 each, he will pay for 2 pairs of 4 inch shoes.  The fifth pair costs $40, which will be the cost of the shoe he did not return.  Since each pair should cost $10 each, each pair will cost $20 each.  In either case, the 5 pairs are

A perfect example is that of the blind test presented in this book.  If the blind test were too difficult, the dog would tend to ignore the challenge.  Instead, the dog must be asked to perform at a very rapid pace, often within less than a second.  If the dog is slowed down, it will become confused, or the test will fail.  This is very similar to the test that a human who is at rest and not able to see objects moves much more slowly than a human who can see them.  As soon as the dog is able to see objects, the reaction time must increase exponentially.  When learning new things, a dog must go slowly and carefully in order to do all the steps correctly.  It is essential for the dog and the person being tested to build up to each part of the test gradually.  An important thing to remember is that when a dog performs any task, this means that it is also learning to perform the task better and better.

I assume that they can't take you out because they would lose a significant chunk of enrollment for a class with a 5 class load.  Or might they only let you take a course if it's above 5 credits?  B:  Yes, at the university they offer more classes, usually over the summer; take the upper level math course for a summer class and add it to your credits to get into your preferred graduate school.  C:  Yes, professors are pretty flexible.  I have taken classes with 20+ additional material, but only 1 year or so out of college.  A lot of these classes would be very difficult from a teacher's perspective but, when I was in graduate<n>school, professors were willing and able to work with me on extra material.  D:  Yes, in some universities, the professors will allow you to take two classes to get credit towards a degree.  For math, this should be sufficient.  For statistics, this could be too difficult.  If they just start making more and more upper level courses then they might lose a good chunk of the class and be forced to have some class at half-credit only, but, as a student, I would not take up two or three classes unless it was a special subject I really wanted to take.<n><n>A:  Yes, in the city of Cleveland, Ohio, there are many courses that are offered on Saturdays, but they are at a cost of $30 each, compared to a full semester of the same class, which was $70 for the semester.  B:  Yes.  As long as you finish your class work and get a 3.0 out of a 4.0, you will always be put in the class that you were originally in, regardless of course load.  C:  In my case, I took classes in 2 different universities over the course of 2 years and they both ended up being the same in the sense that I did not do too well in the first, which I thought was going to be the easier of the two (I was at the top of my class, however, for the other), but the class ended up being a lot harder.

He goes to the web site, goes to the home page to see that there is not an example of the task and goes to a web site which has a list of the tasks. He finds one example and takes the example to his teacher so that he can see how he can do the rest.  He finds himself frustrated with the assignment because he does not see the way that he can do the other tasks. How can he find the answers. EXPLANATION: The student goes to the home page of the web site.  The home page has information on how to do the tasks, but the web site is not an example of what would be included.  The student has to go to the home page of one of the two web sites, find that one, find something on the web site, put that on the web site, and put information into a web page, all without having read the information on the web site.  This is why I said that he was able to find out a way by doing that.  However, if he had asked, my original question would have made much more sense.

In July there have been 30 deaths of patients in the hospital. In October there are 14 deaths. If the number of deaths were evenly distributed throughout the year then the total number of deaths would be 16.  This is correct.<n><n>Input: There were a total of 865 deaths among the 20 patients in the hospital.  At a cost of $3,500, how much is the hospital making per patient?  The hospital is making $14,400 per patient per year.<n>Output: 32.00  is the total cost of all the patients in the hospital plus the income from the medical insurance.  Because only 865 patients died, the hospital's total income was $3660.00 dollars.  So the total cost of patients was $9500.00.<n><n>Input: This is a 1-minute question.

If you were to double that amount, add a dollar for each of four apples that you double pay $7 for. What price would an apple cost at the grocery store 2 weeks later?<n>The answer would be: $38.  If you were just doubling the price of apples, an apple would cost $16.  If you doubled the price of apples, then add a dollar for each day that you double the price of apples to $32.30.  If you are still doubling apples, at what point would you double-spend an apple at the grocery store?<n>The answer that you will get back is: $60.10  This is because the cost for an additional dollar would increase $12.70.  If you are making a dollar a week, you could afford to buy an entire apple for $14, but since you will be doubling the cost, you would need to buy an extra apple each week to cover your doubling expense.  If you are only making $50 a week, then you can afford a single apple, but you should stick to the budget if you are going to stick to the budget.

He then drove home and put each apple into his trunk and drove to the grocery store.  He placed each one into his trunk and drove a hundred miles east to his small farm.  He fed each apple it's own dish of water.  The apples then began to grow.  Finally, six weeks later, the farmer grew five hundred and forty pounds of apples from the apples that he had taken to the city.

He arrived home and found a stack of mail that he’d forgotten from the mailbox on the way home.  He decided to open the mail then put the mail on the table in the living room. As he tried to figure this out, a light bulb went on for the first time in years.  “What if I put a lamp on a table top?”  He saw in the book that he could do just that.  So he did exactly that.  He picked up a lamp, stuck it over the table, and turned on the lamp, setting the book aside.  That evening he asked Mary, “Did we discuss this?”  Mary’s answer was, “No.  That light is over there.”  The next day John saw Mary going to set the lamp on the table while washing dishes.  In his mind he started a thought process.  “Do the dishes go from the top of the light to the back of the light?”  The next morning, Mary returned the dishes, said “No lights in this house tonight.”  While he was washing the dishes, he realized he had to move the light.  It took a few minutes, but he finally put up the lamp on the table.  Two days later John saw Mary was putting the lamp on the table again.  “I’m not sure you understood me,” he said, as he continued to wash the dishes.  Mary asked, “What now?”  John replied with much more clarity, “I think that the light needs to go over the top of the table and then the bookshelves over there.”<n><n>Input: A woman walks past a picture of a woman and a man holding hands.

Before long, another householder enters.  When he knocks at the door, the woman opens to find 2 children with her.  After a short moment the man knocks and comes into the kitchen.  The first man, a young, thin man, is obviously not the father of the two children.  Then the woman explains that the husband has returned home and that they will begin to eat.  The man goes inside without knocking.  The woman notices that her son has taken off his shoes and is now sitting on the kitchen counter, barefooted; she has not yet noticed the second man coming up.  The first man now enters and has the sense to knock before entering, but the woman allows him to enter first, saying she does not wish to cause discomfort to her son who is playing.  After more than an hour of this, the wife is at her wits' end and calls out to the housekeeper, saying the first man is coming back to her immediately.   "What's all that about?" the housekeeper asks.  "Well," the wife says, "the family that lives here, the father and his wife and their two children, well, they got divorced a few weeks ago after they'd lived here for some months.  The girl lives up the street with me. He's supposed to be going back to his brother's home in the country tomorrow, but his father didn't leave until noon today. Just now I heard him come down the street and knock on my door, but I didn't answer because I feared he wasn't here for the girl."

We wanted to see the Colosso, so we climbed up to the top of a large hill and stood at the top of that hill, looking down on the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. I remember looking down on the Colusso, it was huge. When I first looked down, my friends and I felt as if we were in a film. We could see the entire city and even the Vatican from where we stood up there. My father and I always joked about the Colosso, but we never actually paid attention to what was going on inside the Colosso. We had a lot of fun that day. That afternoon, we went to see the Colosco, which was located outside of Rome, and we were completely dumbstruck when we got there. We were told that we had to get tickets to take a train ride to the top of the hill and from there we could see the Colosso. My father and I did not have any money to buy tickets for the train, so we simply bought tickets with the money we had in our pocket. We took the train from the town back to Rome via train, and then, from our bus, we took the metro to the top of the Colosso. When we arrived at the top of the hill, we were literally blown away by the sheer size of the Colosso and the entire city of Rome, even though we had never been up anything in that part of the world. My father and I both thought that the Colosso was the most impressive thing that Rome had to offer. My dad and I had very little money at the time, but every penny we earned, we saved for the next trip to Rome. That trip never came. When the time came for us to go home, I decided I would take my dad to Italy, because I really wanted to go to the Colosso again. We made that trip, but we arrived in Italy in June, so the Colosso was already open. That was the last time we ever made the trip to Rome.<n><n>Input:  When you go to

After six months, what is the estimated cost?<n>Output: $2,000<n><n>Input: The bus stops at eight stops, each with 5 passengers. During the hour the bus passes each stop there is 50% load, 25% unload and 75% wait. This works out approximately to a 40-passenger bus but, since the bus passes seven stops per hour, it is more accurate to say 25% bus at each stop.  In a week, at the end of the four week period, there will be 40 passengers on the bus. To arrive at 40 passengers by week's end, the bus has passed 6 stops, yielding 4 passengers every hour. The end total is 60,000 passengers, or approximately the average for each bus day.<n>Output: 65,000<n><n>Inputs:<n><n>1. The 5 largest Doberman breeders are listed below.<n><n>2.

Let’s take a look first at the general knowledge question. The student has now taken two hours of school, three hours of study and another half hour of testing.  The student has studied for an entire day.  They also have taken the test 4 times to ensure they have nothing misleading on the test. Now the student has a choice.  They can study for an additional 2 hours, or go for a late lunch and spend another hour studying.  The student can study 1 more hour.  It has been an exhausting day and they will not gain any knowledge. So they choose A.  They also make a choice to get to know their classmates. So, they spend another half hour talking with each classmate.  They gain a friendship with another student that has a common interest with them.  They can also go out at the end of the day for an hour for something fun.   So now they have a choice.  They choose B. They will study another 2 hours today.  They can also spend another half hour talking to their classmates. They gain a friendship with a new friend that has studied the same.  They can also enjoy themselves at a game of basketball or ice skating. So they choose C. So they spend an additional hour working on their intelligence tests again.  They gain an additional half hour of education.  They spend another half hour talking a little more about history.  They gain a little math that they will add to their statistics class. So now they get D.    The math question is easy, but the history question is very hard. So the total is a few hours more of both a knowledge and an education.  Then the test is taken for an additional 2 hours and they get the score they expected. The students also got to know their classmates in class today and have a special friendship for a week. They then spend the rest of their homework working out the rest of the math problems.<n>Output: The student gained knowledge, a relationship and education.<n><n>Output: A young woman named Anna grows up in a small town in Germany.

The students decided that the best way to tell someone was by giving them a sip of the ice tea to show them that it was great.  The students then gave each another sip to show how great the one they had sampled was.  After the students had given each other a taste they were able to determine that the ice tea that they were drinking was the best they had tried so far.  The students then decided the next time the students would share a taste and then compare how the drinks were.  The group decided that the next time they would give another sip and tell someone they would then show them how they had seen the party, and then show them why they liked drinking ice tea instead of the other drinks that the other students had tried.  When the students had given each another taste the first taste had been so good, there could not be any comparison to the others.  Their next tasting would be better because the first taste was so good.  Then they would each give a taste to another person and they could all compare how they had enjoyed the taste of the first taste and then see how they liked the drinks the next time they tasted someone else’s. After they had tasted everyone a few more times they could then make a final choice which drink looked better after each other taste.  Then they picked a favorite drink and decided whether or not to share with the other people at the party whether it was better or not.  Finally they made their best choice drink and went to share it with the other people. After they had all tasted several times, they then made their choice for the drink each of them would recommend to another person. Afterwards the students went about their day enjoying their new friends.<n>Output: B, C, D<n><n>Input (from answer):  There are 10,000 puppies available from a breeder named Mrs. Peabody.

Since we are adding, we get 10 > 20, which then means that when we get to the powers of 10 (10 + 20) + 20, we get 5.

If it floats and falls, it is called a pond. If it floats and is not in the water, it is called an ocean.  If an egg floats and falls, it can no longer be said to be in the water because it did not become underwater.  If an egg does not become underwater after falling, then, it is called an eel. If it does get underwater, it is called a fish.  Therefore:  *Eggs that do not become underwater are called  "lake" eggs or "pond" eggs, not "ocean" eggs. *Eggs that drop below the water but not into the water to escape the water are called "lake" fish, not "pond" fish. *If an egg "is no longer in the water" it is called a pond eel, which no longer is in a lake. *You can safely go in water that you have discovered is not in a lake, but you cannot safely go in water that is in a pond. *You should be careful when in ponds and lakes as you walk on stones.

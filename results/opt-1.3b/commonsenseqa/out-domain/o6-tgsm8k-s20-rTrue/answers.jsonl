The nightmare scenario of a car crashing into the house was a dream.

He would be in denial. He will not know about the dreamworker until tomorrow morning.\nAnswer: A is right, because the car accident scenario was a dream.

The dreamworker caused the accident by making Stan lie down on the asphalt.

Each rider can communicate by a book that is carried in a pouch by the middle of the torso.\nD: In the book, there are 12 people in the helicopter. Each one of them has their own book to keep their own business straight. This book tells other riders to keep the same book in their own pocket. There are six small pockets that are all filled with a book to help transport the rider into another location.\nE: In the Book there is only one rider. There is no vehicle in the book. Just because they don't use a vehicle doesn't mean they couldn't use a book. In this instance, it would probably be using something like a compass to figure out the correct route.\nF: In the Book there were 25 people in the helicopter. That is the only way to carry that many people around in their helicopter. Each person will have their own private room. If an individual who is not in the helicopter sees the people on the inside of it, they won't know what they are. If they are in the back of the helicopter, they should be safe from observation.\nG: Each person in the helicopter carries a book or has a device to help them move around and communicate with the pilots.\nH: Each person travels in the helicopter in their own compartment where no one else can see.", "answer": "B: own cars"}

This lake is the largest lake in the western United States and is surrounded by mountain ranges. It was created after the 1906 earthquake, and the lake is home to an incredible array of wildlife, including flamingos. There is a beautiful beach in the nearby city of Berkeley, and there is also a beautiful beach in Carmel. The beaches in Mexico City are also very beautiful because the cities are surrounded by mountains, and the city of Mexico State offers many beaches in various areas on the side of the mountains. Each of these beaches is very different from the others, so it is hard to find a beach that is truly the most scenic, but there are some beaches that are very close and very beautiful. Here are a few beaches that are quite close to the famous Balboa Park in San Francisco.\n1. The beaches of Half Moon Bay (also called Half Moon Village) are really nice. They are just outside the city limits, just a bit south of San Francisco. This beach is about 20 minutes north of the city of Berkeley. It is also a good beach", "answer": "B: city"}
{"text": "When a home is remodeled, it may be common that all the items are removed or moved. There are two reasons for a move or removal, the first being to store them better and the second being to make space in the area. The decision of whether a room will remain intact or not is left to the homeowner. If the item cannot be moved then a decision should be made of whether it will stay in the attic.\nOutput: For a historical item, a decision must be made whether to keep it as well as if the attic should be used for storing it.\nWe have a lot of items that will be put away for storage and then moved around in the new space of the house.

What is the radius of the sphere of radius x that the z-coordinate is equal to z = y?\nOutput: (a) The x-coordinate z is equal to the y-coordinate z.\n(b) If y - x = z, then x x = z.\n(c) If x = x, then y = x.\n(d) It cannot be true that y > z - y, because y < z = 1 at the x-coordinate z. This also means that z > y - y.\nSo the final equation is: y = -x + y = -z = -(1 - y).\n\nInput: What should the weight of a human weight be measured by in a standard yard?\nOutput: When we use the weight of the human body as a metric for weight, the normal way of measuring a human's weight is by the square of the square of the distance from the ground to the feet of the body. The square of 1 meter is 3,908,600 grams\nThe problem is that it's not really a problem, because we use the foot in common usage, and in most languages, the word metrically, is used as a word for weight.\nThe final equation is: the weight of the human in the square meter of the diameter is 3,908.664,000 kilograms\n\nInput: Name a few objects that can be considered the most common type of person.", "answer": "A: attached"}

It gives the speed or travel time of light in a vacuum or in other non-cannular media.\nOutput: The speed of light depends on the distance between the point of divergence point and the center of the universe. You can think of two distances being separated by time or space, and one being located where the two are separated by distance. We are using time to think about distance and space. The distance between divergence point and center can represent the distance of a circle around the origin. The space is the number of units of distance between the point of origin and center. The numbers 300 and 600 represent the diameter of the universe. Therefore, we need to find the distance from the divergence point to center, and multiply by the diameter of the universe, which is 600.\n\nInput: Let us suppose that your friend Tom is a salesman at a mall that has a large selection of clothing that is very fashionable.

Yesterday, she was walking home across a busy street with one hand in her pocket. When the car turned the corner, she tripped, and her hand fell to the pavement.   When she came to, she couldn't move her hand, she couldn't lift her hand (her thumb was on the wrong side of the joint), and she couldn't straighten her arm out of the armpit.   How could a person be hurt in such a way? How would the damage to the hand have been minimized?\nOutput: When faced with such a situation, the easiest thing to do is assume your injured, because most of the time it's something simple that will be corrected through simple medical procedures.  The patient would be able to deal with their injuries over the course of several days, so the damage wouldn't be permanent.  It would also probably be very difficult, if not impossible, if the injury happened on the job (if she was an employee of the manufacturer, she might have an injured worker comp claim).  So the patient wouldn't really be faced with permanent damage and their hand would most likely be healed by the following Sunday (assuming she was an employee).\n\nSubstituting the value of $0, she would have received 15*$200 = <<15*200=1500>>1500 dollars.

So Nalani finds out what the number of people who eat at the restaurant is by: \u2022 finding the number of people who come in\nConsequently and before she can figure this out, Nalani says I want a glass of milk\nShe does: \u2022 She calculates: The number of people who come into my restaurant is 10 multiplied by 10 divided by 10\nSo: 1/10^10 + 10*10+10*10 + 10*10 = 11.8981 people\nThat's the figure that Nalani has to work with, since she starts with the 10 pizza thing\n\nInput: Michael is at home after being at his restaurant for a month.

This is the total cash he got. So he doesn't profit from selling it, and returns the profit. \"A\" (cash-only) is the answer, but \"B\" (profit-share) is the correct answer.\nB: if the company becomes bankrupt, then the company will be given up for debt to a creditor. Then Michael's dividend will be cut down by 50 percent. But since this would happen anyway, his dividend would be the same as his profit. Therefore, his profit and dividend from the sale of the company will be both \"A\".\nC: Michael has no reason to sell the company, because there is no reason for him to do so.\nD: Michael has no reason not to sell the company (because he can already get enough money from selling it). So his profit and his dividend from the sale of his own company are also \"A\".\nE: after the company is taken over by a new owner, Michael commits a crime to keep the company, which is illegal. But since the company wouldn't have existed if Michael wasn't in the company, his crime is only a misdemeanor. Therefore, his crime is also a misdemeanor but is allowed to be combined with the crime of selling the company since it was a part of him.

What is the best way Alice could stop her car at the traffic lights?\nOutput: We first look for the total number of cars: 9 x 2 = 33.\nThen we look for a combination of one car going through the lights and two cars going through the lights: 1 x 9 = 3 x 9 = 5 x 9. So the total number of cars at the lights is: 5 x 3 = 12 cars.\nIf there are 12 cars at the lights, we also would expect one car goes through the lights, leaving 1 car at the light.\nThen, we look for a combination: 1 car goes through the lights and 2 cars go through the lights. So the total number that would go through is: 6 x 3 = 12 cars\nThis is how many cars there are at the lights\nSo we go back and add up all the combinations: 12 x 13 = 36\nMultiplying everything by 36, we get 36 / 27 = 4\nSo the final answer for the problem is 4\n\nInput: A student in a college class came to ask for advice. \"How many times can you buy the same thing at the supermarket?\"\nOutput: Let's break it down.\nSo I'll ask for all the groceries and food items he can get.\nHe can get all the groceries and food products:\n* 12 breads: ($2.80 each)\n* 12 milk cartons: ($1.25 each)\n* 12 apples ($3.20 each)\n* 12 whole milk ($1.35 each)\n* 12 eggs ($1.20 each)\nSo we need to multiply these total prices by 2: 12 + 12 + $1.35 = $2.80 + $6.65 = $15\nSo the grocery item prices range from $7.55 to $4.35.\nIf we take this item-by-item basis, then he gets a total grocery amount between:\n* $7.55 ($2.80 * 10 * 12) / $15 =\n* $5.00 ($2.80 * 12) / $2.55 =\nSo we know the student can buy as many as: 6 x 12 = 20.\nSo I guess we can say the student already bought: 6 x 20 = $60\nSo he can use his money", "answer": "D: making money"}

{"text": "You'll be surprised. But if you only chose three things, one would probably be D; others would be A, B and C\nFirst, A is obviously true because we don't have the kind of heart disease or cholesterol problems that usually happen when one exercises. But that's not all.\nLet's compare those who train regularly to those who have no idea what they're doing. Here's which people in the data with no idea what they're putting themselves through get healthier than people who do.\nAthletes who exercise regularly:  More likely to eat better compared to those that don't   More likely to get sleep compared to those that do Not exercising:  Less likely to get sleep compared those who do Exercise often compared to people who do Not exercise Often:  Less likely to live longer compared to people that live normally       This compares people who have gotten regular exercise compared to those who haven't.\nSince A is also true, it's quite likely that at least some of the improvement comes from the health benefits of physical activity. Exercise improves health, so it makes sense that people who exercise more would have better health from the exercise.\nNow onto B, heart attack prevention. Physical activity reduces the risk of heart attack by about 15-20% - depending on what kind of regular exercise is involved. That's one way it does that.\nWe know the benefits from exercise can also help reduce the risk of stroke, dementia, and other diseases. The body can also change in other ways, too. The researchers found that people who exercise more, even long-term, generally tend to have better cognitive and physical function.\nNow that we've discussed physical activity as a great overall benefit of exercise, let's talk about D. Exercise improves the quality of life and helps with stress. It also has important effects on inflammation and blood flow, which is good overall.\nExercising daily helps reduce stress, whether by reducing body fat or by preventing depression or anxiety. There has never been a better time to exercise, either. We have lower unemployment than ever, and there are now more choices to choose from than ever before.

So, the total number of people who occupied any room in the school was 1835.\nSolution: In 2010, the building had 28 classrooms, so it is hard to estimate the rooms occupied. But, each room had a desk inside, so the total number of people occupying any of the rooms was 663.\nIf we assume 663 occupied more than 1 room in the school, then the total number of people in the school was 663*(28+6)*1,913 = 768.\nIf we take out 16 of the rooms to make a total of 645, and add the remaining 645 to make 739, then we can calculate we get 72, since 72 * 36 = 72 was students.\nThus, the total number of students in this school is 72+6 * 9*1 = 90\n\nInput:In the first game of chess, the king does not take any moves.

This was great news, and the elephant lived happily in her family for about 6 weeks. Unfortunately, the mother died, leaving her son, Yama. How many weeks did the elephant live with his mother? Calculate the total number of weeks and months it lived with its mother.\nOutput: 6 weeks \u2013 3 months = <<6*3+3+3=12>>12 weeks\n2*3+3+2*2*2*2 = 3*3+2*2 = 10 + 10 = 12 weeks\nSince the amount of time spent with a baby elephant at each day varies by day during growth phases, and since 3*3+2+2+2+ 2+ 2+ 2+2 = 12 weeks at each day, the number of weeks and months the elephant lived with its mother will change according to day\nBecause 3*5+5+5= 12 weeks at night, the number of weeks the elephant spent with its mother will also change according to night\nSo the final answer will vary according to day\n\nInput: After 6 months, the baby elephant was left alone and began to grow up. The elephant was not allowed to eat grass or any plant food, so it stayed mostly to the water bowl and drank water all day. Then at nighttime, it went to sleep by looking at the moon. The moon fell on Thursday and the owl woke up on Friday morning. If the elephant woke up early on Sunday and stayed awake till Monday morning, it could not go into sleep by looking at the sun. When the owl rested in its bed on Sunday evening, it woke up on Monday morning looking at Monday and Tuesday morning. If it woke up early on Monday morning and stayed awake till Tuesday morning, it could not start sleeping by looking at Friday and Saturday mornings. When it woke up early on Friday morning and stayed awake till Saturday morning, it could not stay awake till Sunday morning.\nSo the total amount of weeks during growth phases when the elephant slept on its stomach/left side was 12*6*6 = 12*12*12.\nAfter a month, the elephant still had not slept with its mother. For the first 3 weeks, the elephant stayed awake by looking at the moon, but after the moon fell in September, it went to sleep on its stomach/left.

Also, because the average price of corn is only $3 for most crops, you would have no problem planting wheat unless it is close to peak production.\nSo we can safely assume that soybeans are planted at twice the number of crops as corn is typically planted.\nSo the final total is 12.5\n\nInput: The average yield of a bushel of corn is $16.30.

In this case, the hours are divided by the number of workdays in a week. The answer to the first condition is: A minus (B) and A minus (C), or: A minus (B): B, subtract (C) or (A+(B+C+D)) = B.\nOutput: The second condition means that (B) minus (A or (C) plus D) and (B)(C+D)= A, or: B minus (C or A+(D+E)) and A minus (C or A): (B)+(D+E)= A = B.\nNow, you want to get to the last condition, but what is the value of (A\u2013C)*C?\nThe total number of hours worked in a week is divided by (C) = A*C*4\nThen A is divided by (C + B+D)/C = A. Thus A is divided by (B)/C = A. As a result, A divided by (B)/(C)*C, plus A minus (B)/(C)=A=A = A < 10, so A is divided by (D**C)/(C)*C = A(C+B)/(C)*(C) and A is divided by (E**D)/C = A: A<10; A less than 2 and A>10. so A is divided and A is multiplied by 2.\nSo the final number is 20.\n\nInput: Two people meet for a three hour lunch date each week.

Where can I buy new, used cell phones for $150 each or less?\nOutput: The next thing you can find for as cheap a phone is a $1000 flip phone, but it is a little complicated and not really worth it. If you are looking for a phone that is similar to an iPhone, there are now about 60,000 different iPhone clones available. The most common phones that are being copied are Nokia 7300, Sony Ericsson G510 and Symbian S60. But the price of Nokia 7300 varies from $80 to $100, and the price of Sony Ericsson G510 varies up from $300 to $700. You could get a Sony Ericsson G510 for $300, which is very similar to the iPhone 2s and the iPhone 3. These phones are sold online for as little as $20. You can get an iPhone clone, which is like an iPhone, for $99.99, or you can get a cheaper iPhone clone, which is pretty much the same as an original iPhone, for $79.95. So the good news is if you go to a electronics store they probably have one of the newer iPhone clones for $99.99 or less. The only problem is you only get one of the clones. If two people bought a phone that is similar but slightly different, they would both get the exact same phone, or they would each get two clones, but the two clones are different. If the people who bought the phones each wanted their phones to be the same, they would have to exchange their phones. The price of a phone really depends on where it is being sold. If it is an electronics store not only can you buy it brand new, they can often buy newer, better working phones and sell them even cheaper brand new. You can generally get another used cell phone for $200 but you know the second one will be old and broken. On Ebay you can rarely find a newer, working phone for less than $100 but", "answer": "C: candle"}

You're going to have a great life. And then she sends it to her mother.\nWhy did Kelsey write the card on the same day that her son is receiving the card?\nIn order to find the answer to this question, first we need a way to determine when a child is giving birth. Here is a formula: when the child opens their eyes the birth process is started. This is based on when our eyes are first opened.\nFirst we have to figure out:\nNumber one: What is the day of the month?\nNumber two: What is the hour of the day?\nNumber three, after the first month.\nNumber four, after the 13th month.\nNumber five, after the 35th month.\nWe figure out these 3 numbers together the first half of April.\nNumber three we multiply then add.\nNumber four we multiply:\nThen add:\nNumber five we multiply with the number 4 we have to find the day of the month.\nThen add:\nThen multiply:\nNumber five is the same as the number four and that is the start of the cycle.\nNumber 4 is the beginning of the year then the new month (February).\nThe cycle has 16 days, so we add and subtract to get 24.\nThe final result is April.\nSince April has 16 days, then we multiply the day it begins with the same number as the day the child was born. So April 1st will be the first day of April.\nThen we take the number 2, 1, 24 = 9 and multiply that with the day she gave birth.\nThen we add the two numbers for the birth day. So birth day = 1/10 (day 1) + 1/10 (birth day + 1/2 = 2) + 1/10 + 2 = 3.5.\nFinally, we add the three numbers from birthday and then subtract from it to get the number of days we are looking for.\nSo we have:\nApril 1st = 27 days\nApril 2nd =", "answer": "B: see light"}

You can only stand on one wall. Which wall do you want to stand on?\nOutput: If you stand on one wall, what size room do you have available?\nThe answer should be small because you can only stand on the wall that is closest to the floor. Therefore, you would get the following area:\ny = 40 + (x + 12 + 20) + 45 = <<40 + 40 =12>>12\nIf you stand on the closest wall, the final solution should be\ny = 40 + < 50 = 5>>45 + 15 = 5>>15\nIn fact, when you walk around the room, you will notice that it is larger because it has a larger area because of the space between two walls. Thus all the walls have the same overall area.\nOutput: If you can stand on one wall and can stand on each of the walls, the final\nsolution for the area will be\ny = 20 + <<20 + < 50 = 15>>15 + <50 =5>>45\nThe final answer is 5\nNow, let us find the area that can be used for a bench.

How much money will Jane and George need to save to buy a condo and house in a year?\nOutput: Jane and George need 5 years worth of saving to invest $3,000 a month.\nSo the final total is $15,000.\nSo since Jane and George need $3,000 a quarter, they need 25% of their savings to pay for their condo and house. They can save 25% of their savings, which will be $1,500 per quarter. By investing $3,000 a day for 25 days, they will save $1,500 in each month, which is $5,000.

{"text": "Play the following two songs:\nOne: The Circle by The Smiths\nTwo: Love Songs, by George Harrison\n\nInput:A guy has four chickens on his property. He buys one egg each day for $3. Every day, he sells one egg for $5. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, he sells 50 eggs for $5 each. What is the gross profit from the week he sold 50 eggs for $5 per day?\nOutput: We are interested in determining the total net profit from buying and selling eggs on the week of January 15th through January 23rd. We use the formula for calculating the profit:\nGrossprofit = 1 + (1 - eggcost/(eggtime)^1/14)/50\nHere is the formula for calculating the eggtime:\n= Eggtimer*300\nLet eggcost be $3, eggtimer $14, and eggtime = (300^2)*1/14.\nNow multiply the number of days in the week we are calculating the net profit by the number of days in each of the other weeks. This is\nGrossprofit = 2*(1 - $3)^2\nOutput:We determined that the net profit this week was $50. That gives us the total net profit of $50 over the last 7 days.\n\nInput:A person has 20 chickens on his property. When it rains hard, the water gets in the trough where the chicken food is stored.

This budget would pay $70 a month to her if she lived in a nursing home. Sally will go in her apartment on a monthly basis, so Sally needs to calculate the income she will receive after living at an apartment.\nOutput: Sally must divide that $40 weekly income by 5 and calculate its cost per week.

An elephant's daily diet consists of one small meal a day. How many pounds would the elephant get in 20 million years?\nOutput: How many pounds can an elephant get in 20 million?\nWe can solve this by looking at the weight of the elephant. The first solution is equal to 1, which is a good guess. We can estimate what a elephant weighs in two ways.\nThe first way is using its estimated lifespan, and looking up in reference, like a math book: if the elephant is 10 years old, it had a lifespan of 50 years, and so on.\nIf the elephant lives for 10 years, this gives us 50 x 10 = 60 years, which is the number that appears in reference (the elephant is 20 years old, so this gives us 20 x 10 = 600 years),\nThe second way is using a horse's lifespan, and estimating that a horse has a life span that is a multiple of 10 years. For a horse, which is 20 years old, we find:\n20 * 10 = 60 years, or 60 * 10 = 5,880,000 years.\nSo to calculate the amount of years that the elephant needs:\n10 * 5,880,000 = 695,000 years, or 65,400 years.\nThe elephant's lifespan", "answer": "B: passing grade"}

After the 30 centimeters was added, the distance was equal to 24 centimeters. The 30 centimeters was subtracted from the distance, and the result was equal to 18 centimeters. So the distance is 30 centimeters.\nSo the final result is:\nThe original road was equal to the road that starts from the flat road. So the total distance travelled is 1.25 meters (0.75 inch).\nSubtracting the distance in the first mile and 10 centimeters, the total was equal to 1.25 meters (1.12 inch)\nMultiplying by 0.75, the distance in the hill was equal to 45 centimeters, so the total distance to the end of the road was equal to 20 centimeters.\nSo the original road was greater than the road that starts from it. So the total distance increased by 30 centimeters.\nMultiplying by 2.737, the distance after the 30 centimeters was equal to 50 centimeters (1.52 inch).\nSince the first mile was equal 40 centimeters, the distance in the first hour was equal to 6.5 centimeters (0.32 inch).\nSo the first hour was equal 30 centimeters, so the total in the hour was equal to 9 centimeters (0.32 inches).\nSo the total was 13 centimeters (3.33 inches)\nMultiplying the difference between the first hour and hour 3, the distance in the hour 3 was equal to 4 centimeters (0.12 inches).\nMultiplying the sum of the distances in the hour 3, the total was 22.3 centimeters (8.72 inches).\nSubtract 1.2 meters (0.34 inch) from the total, and the total is 16 centimeters (3.93 inches)\nMultiply 0.25 by 0.5, the length in the first hour was 33 centimeters, so the total was 33 meters (106.83 inches).\nMultiply 2.4 by 2, the distance in the half hour was equal to 1.3 centimeters (0.3 inches).\nMultiplate (2 * 2) 0.84, the distance in half hour was equal to 3.6 centimeters (1.", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}

The minimum required deposit is a $250 guarantor's fee, plus any other deposits or fees on the loan if you are over 35% or 35% equity on the property.\nOutput: We know that a lender must have a cosigner. So this question is not really a good one. Our best advice would be: look for a cheaper lender. This is a hard one, though, because we only make this judgment on \"normal\" lenders.\nThe question becomes more subjective as you get to a more high-end lender. The most common loan for people with high-end properties is a $250,000 mortgage. So this would be the question to ask is a $500,000 loan on a $500,000 property. Then we would want to ask \"What is the typical size of investment property? \" Because that would determine if your loan would be suitable for a $500,000 investment property.\n\nInput: There are three male models who have a total of 6 breasts.

{"text": "Decreasing wages, increasing the supply of goods, diminishing demand for goods and increasing the supply of money.\nSo decreasing wages is the negative option. Economists argue that decreasing wages is the only possible answer. Economists do not have any definitive answer as to why wages have a direct effect on inflation. The answer is a combination of several factors, but a simple theory is that wages are directly responsible by causing the supply of goods to increase. That is, for a dollar to be worth the same today, labor has not been valued as highly over the generations. This leads to a decrease in the purchasing power of the dollar. Decreasing wages is the only viable answer.\nIf decreasing salaries are not a problem, the last viable option is deflation. Inflation can be a huge problem in a nation such as Japan, which uses almost no currency to the point where the value of a dollar goes down. The Japanese government has spent a lot of money on a new currency called the Yens, and the new Yens have not been worth as much as some of the old Yen's. In essence, the Japanese government is devaluing its currency by printing money. Declining wages are responsible, since the Yen's value is determined by the demand more than any other factor, and if the demand decreases, the Yen's value drops.\nThe alternative is inflation, in which the demand does not drop. In other words, the supply of goods is increased and the value of goods increases proportionately. Inflation is the only viable answer to deflation.\nThus, reducing salaries would be a better solution, as salaries are directly responsible by increasing the demand. Inflation is therefore a negative and should be avoided.\n\nInput: Let's say that two cows come together for mating. These cows will not be happy until after the mated couple have created a calf.

{"text": "Which option is the most creative?\n\nInput: The price of a dog is dependent on the weight of the dog and the size of the dog, however there is a more complex relationship between weight and cost so we will try it.\nThe first thing to do is to find out the weight of the dog. The weight of a dog depends on several factors. The dog's weight, breed, and size. These factors all contribute to the weight of the dog, so all the different weights add up.\nThe weight of a dog depends also on two other important factors, how old he is and how much he weighs. A puppy will weigh more than a dog that is more mature. It makes sense that if a puppy will grow to be a dog that will weigh more, he should also get to carry more.\nAt the same time, small dogs tend to only stay young for a short period of time so you will often see them with their young.\nSo the overall weight of a dog is:\nA puppy's weight = (A + B + C)*(1 - A + B + C)*A\nA puppy's weight is:\nA puppy weighs: 100 kg\nA puppy can carry: 60 kg\nA puppy is: 4.5 x 6 x 20 h\n(B + C * 6 * 20) x (A + B) = 60 kg\nA puppy dog weighs: 3.5 x 6 x 15 h\n(B * 6 * 15) x (A + (B + C)) = 60 kg\nSo a dog with the following weight can carry:\n200 kg\nIf the dog is young, he can weigh only the amount needed. When he grows older, because he was only a puppy on the day he started, he becomes bigger. The puppies grow only for half a year, but after that they get the bulk of their weight from their mother.\nIn an adult dog the weight of an animal is much more similar to the weight of a plant, as the only way to increase the amount of weight you have is to increase the volume of meat, milk or other product that you have, regardless of how you weight the animal. A fat dog has more muscle than a lean one, but not as much fat. So a lean large dog might weigh 80 kg but is only 100 kg heavy for this reason. So when he is only an adolescent, he weighs twice as much as when he is four years old.\nSo the average weight of all dogs from", "answer": "B: create art"}

The following questions are to determine if the deaf can feel:\n- If their body can't sweat, that is, they cannot sweat as you would sweat.\n- If they cannot feel their heart beating, they cannot feel the beating of the heart.\n- If they can not move, they cannot move a thing.\n- If they make no sound, they cannot make sounds.\n- If you cannot hear their voice, they cannot hear you.\n- If you can't see their face, they cannot see you.\n- If your back hurts them, they cannot cause pain to you.\n- If they do not need to eat, they do not need to get food.\n- If they have no problems talking, they can talk.\n- If their only means of communication is through words, they can speak.\n- If they are unable to understand what we are saying, we can understand them.\n- If they could not communicate by making sounds, we can understand their voice.\nYou can also choose the first choice and skip to the other answers.\nOutput: A deaf person could not feel.\n\nInput: What do we mean when we tell hearing people they are hearing a deaf person, instead of deaf people?

That means that their fandom is a moneymaking project, but it\u2019s not the whole story.\nB: Happy \u2014 There are all kinds of happy fans \u2014 some make very little money, some make thousands of dollars, and some make fortunes. But all of these people have the same goal: they want to do things they enjoy doing on their own terms, and then get paid for doing them. The two artists are different, but the goal is the same.\nC: Freaking out \u2014 This is the category that fans who are not happy in their fandoms choose to fall into. They can be either happy or freaked out.\nD: Receiving money \u2014 You see a lot of this type of fan when it comes to sports. You see fans from major sports teams that switch to a different sport fandom when it becomes clear that the sports team they were supporting has a losing streak. They then switch back to the sport fandom they were in before the streak, which is typically the team that is having the most success.\nE: Getting paid \u2014 Well, this is the answer some fans get when their favorite artist does poorly, but we might as well call it a victory lap. The artist is actually really happy about it, because they know that their fans would\u2019ve been happy with that as their outcome anyway. They even go out of their way to say how happy they are \u2014 like by saying how much they\u2019re going to miss it when their artist does well and cheering loudly for them, along with all the other things that fandom is.\nWe will now look at each of the answers individually. We will look at each fandom and their relation to being happy and making money. We will then look at the three major groups of fans who fall into each of the three major categories (A, B, C). Let\u2019s look first to A, where we will look at the selling out group. By selling", "answer": "A: selling out"}
{"text": "The children saw Superman fly overhead, so they expressed that they loved watching television as a result.\n\nYou have just learnt all about the money, the interest rate, and the debt of Nalani and her family members. Now you need to find out if this family is able to afford all the expenses and whether or not they will be able to make ends meet.\n\nSolution:\n1) When Nalani, Lawrence, and Freddy were working at 3 days a week for 6 hours each day, the total money Nalani made was:\nNalani = -1,600 = 50\u00a2 x 6 x 3 = 10 cents\nNalani's total money she earned through work at these places was $250 for 6 hours, which she only spent $230 of.\nThat means she earned 50\u00a2 x 6 = $10\n\nSo she would have earned $10 per hour working 3 days a week for 4 hours and 16 hours. This means she could work 3 days a week for 10 hours at her salary.\n\n2) Suppose Nalani worked 5.5 hours with Lawrence and 3 hours with Freddy on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, with her husband working 3.5 hours each day. She would have earned $30, meaning she spent $240 in wages and $40 of expenses.\nShe would have needed to spend $120 to cover her expenses.\n\nSince she worked 4.5 hours each day on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, her total expenses were:\n\nEt = 2 + 0 =\nEt = 4 + 30 = $12\nNalani spent $12 for 3 days working four hours at a salary of $12.\nWhich means her total expenses were $30 which only covered her expenses for 3 days.\nSo all her expenses were:\nR = -20\nR = 2 + 40 = R + -20\nNalani had negative $20 from working 3 days a week.\n\n3) It may be easier for you to use one number from the following table to find how much money Michael made from his birdhouse sales.\n\n(2+2/5*10*2) = $52.30\n(10+2/(5+10)) = $38.75\n(10*10)/10 = $30.75\n(10/(5+10) = $10)\n(10/(5/(10/10)]*7) = $20\n(10/", "answer": "D: awesome"}

How many days will Lawrence cook the turkey (10 and then 13)?\nOutput: Let x be the number of days between when Lawrence receives the recipe and when it is cooked.\nx+10 + 13 = <<10+10=22>>22 days\nThis is incorrect. If Lawrence receives the recipe on day 1, and then cooks the turkey on day 8, then he must cook 14*22= <<14*22=46>>46 days\nSince the recipe says to cook the turkey for 2 days and let it rest for 3 days, Lawrence must cook 14*22*3 = <<14*22*4=156>>156 days\nThe correct answer is 2\n\nInput:Alfred and Susan are going on a vacation in June.

Then we do the following:\n1. Find the time it takes for the \"A\" student to get this grade in the past three terms, and we multiply it by 4. This gives us the \"A\" grade\n2. Find out the time it takes the \"B\" student to get this same grade in the past three periods, and we multiply by 3. This gives us the B grade\n3. Now, we divide by 4, and 3 is the \"B\" student's grade\n4. Now, we see that the \"A\" student got an \"A\" grade.\n5. Now, we multiply by 4. We have our \"A\" grade. Now, we multiply the \"B\" student by 3, and we get his \"B\" grade. This is all the time it takes him for them to get similar grades in this three-term period.\n6. Now, we divide both of these two by 4. This gives the \"B\" student a \"B\" grade.\n7. Now, we have the \"B\" student get his \"B\" on Friday, and the \"A\" student gets his \"A\". Since now, our average is higher than before, we get an \"A\"\n8. Now, we divide all the two by 4, and this gives us the \"A\", so now the average for both of the two is higher than before. Since they got similar grades in the past three months, we get an \"AA\". Then, we give the \"A\" student", "answer": "C: marriage"}

After thinking some more, we can say that, for practical purposes, when we say  a human sitting with the bowl of water over their head, we mean, in a human\u2019s head. We define our human to be anywhere and at any time that it might be useful for the human to sit. Since the human is in the human\u2019s head, it would make sense for him to sit in his or her head. If you place a bowl of water over your head and sit in your head, you might not think at all. You would not even have a seat to sit in, just an area where you would sit. We would consider a person in a place which they would not mind sitting in at all to be in a \u201chuman\u201d seat. That is, it would make sense to put the bowl or the water over the human\u2019s own head and then, since the human is in the head, the bowl or the water would serve two purposes: to put the human into a human seat and to bring some comfort to the human. That is, we would put the bowl or the drinking water over the human\u2018s own head and then sit back in our human seat!\nWe think further about the topic of \u201chuman seats\u201d by considering two things: first, how comfortable we would want the bowl of water over our heads to be, and, secondly, how far away such a human chair would be from our human seat. There is a difference between the distance a human can push a bowl of water away from its head and the distance the bowl of water can be pushed away from any part of the human\u2018s body. For a human, the distance that the water is pushed away from the body is known as the \u201chuman seat.\u201d On the other hand, the distance that the bowl can be pushed away from it\u2019s base is called the \u201chuman table.\u201d If we think about a human sitting in a chair which is farther away from the base of the chair than near the head of the chair, it would be possible to have a bowl of water on the human\u2019s human seat.

Calculate it.\nOutput: A whale moving at sea water has a speed of 12 m/s. The whale at the land surface has a speed of 10 m/s. If the whale on the sea surface has a range of 500m from home, the whale at land will travel 100m and the ocean whale will travel 150m in the same time period, thus a whale at sea would require 500m longer to travel from home to land at home than from the ocean to home, so in the same time period the whale at sea would travel 600-700 meters less than the whale at land.\nInput: How do you know how fast water is moving?\nOutput: To know the speed of water, take the water velocity in kilometers per hour and multiply it by 4. This figure is the water velocity, k/s, or km/h.\nInput: Is there more than one way to count kilometers?

He then poured a spoonful of jelly into the jar of peanut buttered sauce. He then threw the spoonful of jelly into both jars.\nSince both jars of peanut butter were now the same, which jar is the greater amount of peanut butter?\nOutput: John put a spoonful of peanut into the jar of peanut from the jar of jelly. Then put a spoonful of jelly back in the jar of peanut butter from the jar of jelly, thus getting 4 teaspoons of peanut butter in each jar. He then put a peanut butter spoon full into the center of the peanut butter from the jar and poured the last peanut butter spoon in a jar of jelly.\nOutput: So the total amount of peanut butter in each container is 4*((4 * 3) +2) = 6.16 ounces\nOutput: So the full amount of peanut butter is 6 oz\nSo, in Step 6, you need to take out the two tablespoons of jelly out of the last container of peanut butter to determine the final amount of peanut butter.\nInput: Jim made a turkey sandwich.

{"text": "The top cloud is very low and looks like it will be warm. If the cloud is on the right, the sun will shine on you, and the clouds on the left will be cooler.\nLet x = the temperature in the sky. The cloud is going to be between 5 and 10\u00b0C, and the sun will shine on the cloud and on you, and then it will dry on the same side in 20 minutes.\nSince we know that x = 12 + 5 = 13, we know that we can get from the forecast the temperature of the cloud and estimate the amount of daylight in the day.\nSince the cloud will be between 5 and 10, the forecast will predict an approximately equal amount of daylight in the morning and in the evening.\nSince the cloud is about 5\u00b0C, the forecast will predict at least an hour of sunshine from an hour of darkness.\nSince the cloud looks a little dark in the forecast, we can only get a few hours of sunshine without a heavy rain.\nSince the cloud in the forecast is very close to a mountain and has about 50% visibility at 5 PM, the forecast is not so accurate.\nSince the temperature in the forecast is going to be between 6 and 10 degreesC, the forecast will not be accurate.\nSince the cloud has a low visibility of 50% and seems cloudy, the forecast is probably a little too vague.\nSince the cloud appears dark, it could have been the sun that was shining through it. If you see the cloud, you can look for a cloudless sky instead. If the sky is cloudy, you should look to the sky west or south of you. If the sky is clear, you probably won't see a cloud until 2 PM or so.\nOutput:\nWe can only tell the forecast was very close to accurate by checking the time.\nIf there is rain from the forecast, we may get little precipitation.\nIf the cloud appears to be dark, the forecast was probably too vague.\nIf the cloud is dark, some people will interpret that to mean that there will be thunderstorms around.\nIf the cloud has a good visibility of 50%, some people will interpret that the clouds will be sunny.

{"text": "How often does a car accident occur?\nInput: Michael and Sarah are headed to the store to stock it with new batteries and other miscellaneous items needed. They take their vehicle, with 12 batteries, to the store. However, once there, they find that the original batteries are only sufficient to power it for a half hour, while the newer batteries are able to run the car for four hours. What are the most likely causes of the problem?\nOutput: Michael and Sarah find their vehicle still on the road by accident. Michael finds the original batteries and they replace them. Since they are only capable of running the car for half an hour, they return the vehicle to the store. How long could the two have run away before they were discovered?\nSince no information was given regarding potential causes of the accident, we will assume that the two were in the store when it happened. This is a very common mistake, and is probably the most common cause of an accident. A more likely reason for the accident would likely be the inability of the owners of the car to realize that the car should have been charged for four hours, rather than needing a half hour.\n\nThe answer is 1 + 4 = 4.\nAnswer: An engine consists of a number of parts. The oil pump, transmission fluid, and fuel pump all work together to make the engine turn over the wheels. Since every part must work together to get the engine to run, there is a chance that the parts will not function properly without each other. That chance increases when a part becomes jammed, worn, misaligned, or overfilled. As the chance increases, there is an opportunity for something to go wrong, but with every potential failure, there is a greater chance that something in the operation of the car will fail. Some things that are considered to be of better quality, but at the price of being worn, are:\nThe oil pan\nThe timing chain\nThe alternator\nThe cooling system\nThe fuel filter\nThe radiator\nThe air filter\nEach of these could fail on a regular basis, allowing the engine to be idled for long periods of time. Every situation, including running for 4 hours on a faulty alternator, would result in heat built up beyond what could be expected for the engine.\nInput:\nThe question asks what percentage of the time an engine has been idled, on average.

His job involves standing for all or part of the day. When he stands, he uses his hand to support his body, and his feet to support his knees. Adam also needs to be able to walk from one place to another, so he requires leg lift shoes to support his foot. How many hours does Adam work each day when he stands?\nOutput: An average of 5 hours each day, which would be 15 hours each week, if the average workday is 8 hours long.\nIf Adam works 10 hours per day for a week, he is averaging 10 hours per week, so he works 15 hours per week.\nSo the average workday for Adam would be: 45 hours long and 15 hours per day = 9 hours long per day.\nWe can figure the hours spent in a meeting at 45 + 15 = 61, so it appears that 9 hours per day is the average workday for those in Adam's office building.\nSo the final value for Adam's job, if it were considered a real job rather than the job of his desk, is 45-9=61 and 60 hours per week.\nSince 9 hours per day is equal to 59 hours per week, it would add 59 + 59 = 63, which works out to 63.5 hours a week paid.\nSo the final question is: 53.5 hours a week = 56.5 hours per week, so that equals $6.83 an hour\n\nInput: George has 30 pairs of pants sitting in the pantry.

Mike did this too; his robot had all the parts. To prove that there was no chance that they would both forget something on the robot, let the two take the machine apart piece by piece and then put it back together again. The result was that each of them forgot where they put something and found it at a later date. What happened? How did this affect each of their results?\nOutput: If Bob took everything one by one and Mike took the same thing as Bob, so Mike also forgot where he put something as well as why he put something there, Mike\u2019s results would be 10\u00d710*2\u22122 + 10\u22124 + 10\u22122 = |10\u22124|\nSo Mike would have been able to forget where he put the robot and not know where he went wrong.\nBob would never forget anything and Mike would never forget how to get something from point A to point B.\nSince 10\u00d710 = 20 and 20 = 60, Bob and Mike both forgot about 4 times as much as the other guy.\nSo Bob\u2019s results\n\nInput: An adult has a set of 4 children.

{"text": "The answer is << where the food fits>> << where the food fits >>\nWhen we find the space for the dining table, we need to arrange the seats on one side and the table on the other side. So we can do that by taking the space between the chairs to add an additional table, taking the space between the front and back seats to take the chairs to add an extra table, and taking the space between the middle seat and the middle seat to add an extra chair. Then we can place the new table in the room next to the one that has space for it. If this is all the space you can make a table this will increase the size of the room, if there isn't much space then it will have to be rearranged so you will have to make sure there is space on each side of the table, also make sure that the table is tall enough.\nSo the final answers is 3/4 = << where the food fits> << where the food fits >\nWhere they fit and how the food fits determine where the table is: \"Where the food fits\" determines the space of the table but \"Where the food fits >\" determines the size of the table.\nSo the final 3/4 = <<where the food fits> <<where the food fits >.\nWhen they fit and how the table fits determine where this goes: \"Where the food is fit >\" determines the size and location of the table but \"When the food is fit > >\" determines the shape and location of the table.\n\nInput: A and B have 100 chickens that are free-range, free-range and organic.

Each time you stop to get a drink or to eat something along each way, you make a round trip of 20 km. How many hours do you walk each way in two hours?\nOutput: We find 20 hours, in kilometers, taken to cover 20 km.\nIf we add the total distance traveled by the person (Km) to the total distance traveled by each hour of each day, we get:\nK = 20 /(1/2) = 10.5 /60h.\nSo the total distance required to do a round trip of 40 km in two hours is:\nKm = 100 - 60h = 40 / [10.5/60] = 400\nso you walk 40 hours in two hours, each hour.

A: $80 B: $55 C: $37 D: $31 E: $20\nOutput: We know that Bruce uses the money in his savings to send his children's checks. We also know that when Bruce makes $80 per week, we divide that by three. That means that he makes $35, or $40, per week. So B is correct, B would be correct.\nExample: Take all of the money you have and donate it to the local food bank. Then donate the food bank an extra $1 per week. That is, the food bank gives each customer $1 per week. If this customer buys $400 of food per year, that is $200 per year. We donate $2 to the food bank to buy $40 worth of food. If our customer buys $400 worth of food, we donate $50 to the food bank; if he buys $400 worth of meat, we donate $50 and $25 for eggs to buy $75 worth of food. That's $75 for two people; $10 is still for the food bank. The food bank would have only given $25 and $15 to the people, and thus could have only given $75 and $20 per person; that would still be $75 for the food bank. To buy food for three people, we would need $150. If your friends' families sell three times that amount of food, it would raise us $150.

{"text": "Where would you find some swords? You would most probably find a heirloom heirloom sword near the fireplace or in the kitchen. The heirloom sword would likely have at least one owner, usually two, and there is a chance that it was passed between families for generations. A sword that is in good condition (sharp, polished, lasered, or polished) with a good handle would be the best choice. For a sword that has been used, a scabbard is a better option. It would look much better than a heirloom sword's knife-edged blade without a scabbard. Finally, if your sword collection is in the museum or the sword is in the scabbard, the scabbard is the better choice.\nFor another point of view, go to your home's entryway and you are going to find a number of scabbards that have swords in them.

Moreover, you would get a sense of what a sword would feel like and how to take care of it.\nThis way, you would make sure that your sword is at its best. In any case, keep in mind that a heirloom sword should not be used. Instead, you would use this sword and the rest to be on your own shelf.\nFor another point, look at the following picture:\nIf you look at the swords in that picture, what would you take of the first sword?\nIf you remember the pictures from class, you would know that the sword that the sword-carrier held was made in Japan in the 15th century as he was sent by a lord as envoy to the Shogun. It would certainly cost the maker a fortune, but it would have no cost of maintenance as it was in very good condition and had no scratches on it.\nBecause he was sent by the lord, the sword would likely have been one of the best things to carry. If you look at the picture from the picture of the book that the sword was translated out in, you would see that the man probably had a lot of money and used swords frequently. However, he also purchased a sword that had not been cleaned. He also spent the time to make sure that he would never have to repair or clean the sword that he carried into battle.

{"text": "Civil action is the legal process to which a person can resort when they feel that their rights have been violated. We will call them civil rights.\nSo the civil rights to which Nalani can resort are those of being allowed to work within the social structure provided. Each social structure is known as a system. The social structure that Nalani is entitled to is known as the capitalist system. Each system has its own laws to which people can resort when they feel the law is not keeping up with the needs of the system. In the capitalist system, people are entitled to the right to use their intellectual abilities and business ideas to benefit the system. So, when Nalani feels the capitalist system is not keeping up with her intellectual needs, she can resort to the civil rights that she has.\nTo explain, the capitalist system has a hierarchy of social structures to which each individual member of the capitalist system is entitled, or can resort. The highest level of the capitalist system is the free market. Under the free market system, the capitalist is allowed to make decisions on pricing and availability, and on what type of goods and services to produce. The capitalist can make mistakes on pricing and availability, but if they continue to make these mistakes, then they will eventually lose money. If they start buying more expensive goods and services, then there will be more profit for them. By creating a profit for themselves, they can keep their jobs and maintain the welfare of the workers. So when people feel that the capitalist system is not providing the types of services that they need or that their own decisions have not led to enough profit, they can resort to civil action. When people resort to civil action, their rights are protected until the court decides the case for them. This is how the term is written.\nThe term \"riot\" is used to describe the situations that arise in a free market society where people are angry. Civil actions are the actions that arise under a free market which can make people angry.\n\nInput: You are at an appointment with Dr. Bob. You do not like him, but you feel he is a good doctor.

To count all trees that have grown in May, look at the date on which tree can be seen: the date the tree is actually visible to the naked eye. If a tree grows on May 5, it is the last May growth. To count all trees which have grown in June, look at the date when tree can be seen to the naked eye.\nConsider the number of trees to be counted from May 19 to June 19. If the number of trees to begin with is greater than 10, multiply 1-10 and subtract 10 from the final count. If the number of total trees is less than 10, multiply 10, subtract the final count from the numbers in the table and then add 10 to the total trees to begin with. If the number of additional trees to be counted each day is smaller than 10, then multiply 1-10 and add 10 to the total number of trees to begin, subtract 10 from the final number to begin with and then add 10 to another to begin counting trees.\nWe want all May trees counted since they are the last to appear (can be seen) on the tree count. So we multiply the total number of May trees to begin with by 10 and subtract 10 from each. If number 1-10 is greater than 10, we multiply 10 by 1 and add the final number to number 10. If number 1-9 is only one tree, we multiply 10 by 0 and then add this one tree to another tree to begin counting trees. If number 1-8 is only one tree, 1-8*1 and then 10 add the final number to the tree. If number 1-7 is only one tree, 7*7 plus 10 adds the final number to the trees.\nConsider number 19, which is the average of the number of trees to include in the year. We multiply 1-19 by 10 and give this number as the count for trees to count in the number of trees count. If our average number is 10, we multiply 1 by 10 and subtract 10 to give a total of 20 trees. If our average number ends with -2, we multiply that number by 2 and then add 2 to this number to get the total number of trees at the count of 20. Thus, the initial numbers will be 1+200+2+2000+. We then count each tree one at a time to provide a total count of 30 trees at the count of 30", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

{"text": "The blowfish was located off the coast of the Carolinas. The price of the blowfish was $5.00. He then bought 2 buckets of blowfish at the next resturant. Then he went to a store that sells canned blue crabs and he bought 100 lbs of them for $10.00. He then went to the store that sells fish and he got 1/2 pound of fish. He then went to an antique shop and bought a wooden spoon that goes along with a bucket of blue crabs and 20 lbs. Of fish. Then he went to the fish market and bought 100lbs of black cod, 100lbs of fresh shrimp, 50lbs of red tail, 50lbs of yellowtail, 50 lbs of mackerel and 15 lbs of mackerel. Then he went to Walmart, bought a big cooler, and put the seafood in the cooler. Then he took it home and put it in the outdoor freezer in his garage and hung out the freezer sheet and taped it the otherside. He put the fish in the freezer, unplugged the freezer, and left it overnight until it defrosted completely. The following day, he took the same freezer sheet and taped it on the otherside and put the fish in the same freezer. He got out the first freezer sheet and covered the water in the bag of fish, put the first freezer sheet in the can, and put the remaining fish in the can. Then he took the freezer sheet that had the fish in it and put it in the other freezer, covered water with the other freezer sheet the first freezer sheet, and put the can of fish in the can. The result is that the freezer that has the fish in it takes 25 lbs less freezer paper now. So the result of 1/2 pound of frozen fish was $0.99 compared to $2.50 the other way. So the total sale of the fish was $1.59 when he took out the freezer paper and put the frozen fish in. If he took out the freezerpaper that made the freezer take 25 lbs less freezer paper, he lost $2.59 and got 3/4 pound of frozen fish. So the final answer is 3/4 pound of fish\n\nInput: Tessa lived in San Francisco for a long time. She had met a man who had worked for NASA in the 1980's.

Since the monkeys don't sell for the price of a lion, panther, or tiger we can conclude that they're more like monkeys than the other apes, and so Nalani didn't buy them.\nSo the final final total is that neither the captive, nor zoo or monkey's owners had the $300 to afford another monkey.\n\nInput: A man wants to know if his wife has ever been in the hospital because she may have received an unwanted organ transplant.

We need to see in which situation they are really the desirable choices for us; after all, the job is the destination.\nThe choice we're dealing with now is ____________________________________|.\nIn this specific situation, the __________________________________ is a job ________________________________________________|.\nThe answer to that choice is to work; we don't have to worry about the income, which would just be coming in part-time, and there is no need to start saving money.\nSo the selection of ________________________________________________| is the outcome of this, because we really don't want to save money for the purpose of ________________________________________|.\nOnce we've decided which jobs and their ____________ are the most desirable ones, it is time to see how we could find their ____________.

The total profit from all shares of 6,000 is 10,000.\nThe total amount of money the broker earned from all of his shares of 6,000 was: 9,000 + 8,000 = 10,000.\nSo the final amount of money the broker made from all his 6,000 total shares was: 8,000 + 10,000 = $10,000\nThe amount of money the broker could have earned was $10,000, but he failed to make the money as he was required to provide commission income to investors of only $1,000 a week.\nSo, the maximum amount of money the broker possibly made was $10,000\n\nInput: 1.5 kg of sugar is one kilogram.\nOutput: 5 kilograms of sugar per 1.5 kg of food\n\nInput: A company makes $30,000 in profits this month.

If we know that n = 6, then we also know that: n/6 = (-4/2)^2 n = x+2^2 = y +3^2 x = 4^2 y = 3^2 2^22 = x^2 + b - 2^2 = y^2 + a^2 = b^2 + 1^2 = x^2 + 2^2 = y ^2\nThen if we add up all of the parts of the car that are black, we then get 7 parts that are black: y, y^2, x, x^2, x^3, y^3, x^4, y^4, y^6.\nNow if we subtract out all of the other parts, we get two parts that are black: x, y, y^2 and 2^2.\nUsing this, we know that 7/3 = 1 and we can solve for the missing parts by taking the addition rule on the 6th step, which will put us at 1.

The plane crashed at a angle. Find the angle from the plane to the point nearest the trees.\nOutput: This is a simple question, because we already have the angle. Let's solve it first: Solve a=b, the area from a to b and a_c, the area from c to b, by solving the second part, from c + a to c^2, that's 4^2. Let a_2=2a_1, so we have a=b, a_c: 2a_1*(1/d) = 2 - a_1 = 6. Let b^2 = 6*c^2 = 6+6 = 36. Let c^2 = [a +b)*b^2 = 4, where in c is the number of points. Then, solve for d, the angle from a to b, d_4 = 36/4**k/2. Let c_4 = (a-b)4^2 = 2/(2**3+k*2) = 4/8. (a - b+2*k*2/8) = a*8/8. Solve a_4, a_8, b_8 and k_8 by 8/8 and 12/4: 8/8 *6/8 = 36 and 12/4 *4/8 = 12 and 36. So, let r be the radius from the plane to the three trees closest to it. Since there are 36 points, we have r*36 = 36/5 which is 36. So, we have 36^2 so let r=36/5. Using those angles, d_4 = 3/4*4. Suppose that the plane is flying at 30.5 mph", "answer": "E: street"}

{"text": "Choices A- C+E can have many different effects.\nSuppose that you have a bag with some marijuana in it and you want to sell it. Let's say that the bag has, when it is opened, two red bands. You can put in a band for money, for fun, or to show that your marijuana is legal. If the marijuana in the bag gets wet, your marijuana will be wet. When the bag is open, the marijuana is on the first strip. When the bag is closed, the marijuana is on your second strip, which is dry. You can sell your bag with your marijuana still in it, along with a \"dry\" strip or band, for $40, or $25 with this first band, $25 with this second strip, $10 with this third strip, and $5 with this fourth strip. The total amount of extra money you make is $200. Now, suppose that you have 2 baggies with a red band on each piece, and you want to sell them for $30. If you put a $20 band on the third strip, the baggie is worth $100, or $30 + $20 = $65\nOutput: Choices B-E are less interesting that choices A-F. In order to get a $200 profit, only choices B-F are going to bring in a $200 profit, but they are least interesting to the buyer.

So I get the total time played by me. Then I divide my daily practice time by the number of piano lessons per day. This gives me my total playing time. So I divide my total time played by my piano lessons per day, and then this gives me my piano practice time. So I divide by 1/2", "answer": "B: neat"}

In each scenario, Alice asks the following:\n- How likely (or unlikely) is it that Susan would deny Alice permission to paint with her paint\n- What did Susan say?\n- What are the differences in each outcome?\n- What are different effects?\n- Let's put together a list and discuss.\nOutput:\nWhen Susan was not being a smart ass, Alice would not have been allowed to touch Susan's paint.\nWhen Susan was being an ass, Alice would not be allowed to touch Susan's bucket.\nWhen Susan refused to go along with Alice, Alice would not be able to touch her paint.\nThis outcome was: Alice was denied permission to touch Susan's bucket, because Susan was not telling Alice that she did not want to be touched by Alice.\nWhile this outcome is: Susan was given permission to touch Alice's paint because Susan didn't give Alice any reason to disagree with Susan!\nWhile all the outcomes above are possible, Alice is not that likely denied permission to paint by Susan.\nWhile the above outcomes are possible, Susan is not that likely to deny Alice permission to paint!\n\nInput: What is the probability of winning the World Series?\nOutput: 10\n\nInput: A team is trying to guess what song might go along with a particular sport event.

Nakanari was too embarrassed to go back to the house where the bargain was made.

While an open relationship doesn't always work out, it helps you find a loving relationship with someone who makes you feel happy. An open relationship gives your partner more trust in you than you do in yourself. When you find a healthy open relationship, you can be more trusting.

If sales are 1/2 the number of sales in the display case, a) you can have sales. Otherwise, you can have no sales. Solution:\nIf a sale is +1, if b=0, if c is +9, if d is +10, if e is 0, if f is 9, then A= C.\nSolution:\nIf a sale +1 is not equal to a sale, then b=1 is not equal to c is not equal to d is not equal to e is not equal to f is not equal to 9.\nSolution:\nLet f = the first sales in the display cases. Then, we can find f = 12. Now, do we have A,C=9 so we do or do we not have A=9 so we do not?\nSolution:\nLet d=9 so d=9 is not 9. Next, b=0 so b=9 is not 0. Next, c=0 so c=9 is not 0\nIf d=6, we might have 3 sales by f=12 so in this case, we can have (b=1)=(c=2)=(d=11) and (d=18)=d=18 to get A=3 so A=3 is not equal to C. Solution:\n(c=2)(d=11)(e=0)(f = 12)=3\nSince we have b=1 and c=2, (a=1)=(b=3) so if d=0, then c=2 is not equal to d = 0, and d", "answer": "D: big city"}

Jane and Barry hatched their 50 chicks together.\nSince there were 50 chicks hatched, 10/5 is 10/50.\nSince Jane and Barry took care of all 10 hens in their pens, 50 x 10 + 5 = 50/5 = 50\nSince Jane and Barry each had an egg-laying chicken, 10/50 = 50/(10/10+5) = 50\nSince Jane has 12 hens she sold 15/15 = 15/15=15/15\nSince Barry already had 25 hens, 15/25 = 15/25=25/25/25\nSince 25/25 = 25/25 = 25\nSince Jane wanted an egg-laying heifer and Barry has a brood of chicks, both 15/15 = 1515/625 = 525\nSince Jane and Barry were unable to tell the difference between the two layers, both 15/15 and 625 are good guesses\nJane sold 15 birds/25 chickens", "answer": "C: ignorance"}

The simplest way we can find it is to divide the cost of a mouse meal by the number of cats in the food. We divide the cat food cost by 24 cats, add two $200 checks, and see what that leaves us with.\nInput: John and Mary went to a local antique store and had a sale.

In the mean time, you have to find a replacement piece of wood that is less expensive. If you use the smallest part of the crack and reattach it to your piece of wood, do you have to replace the original crack altogether if your piece is any longer? Calculate the cost of this project.\nOutput: If you use 1/2 the crack as the smallest part of the damage and use the cheapest wood for this repair, you have to pay $10 for the original crack and the price of the piece of wood you used is $10. Therefore, if your crack is 1/32\" long and you would use 1/2\" of the crack, your price for this project is $10 + $10 = $20. Therefore, the crack you need to repair is 1/32\"\u00d71/2 = 1/2\"\u00d71/2. Therefore, you need to buy a 1/2\" x 1/2= $20 worth of the right kind of wood.\nThe crack you need to repair in the price is shown in the example. You see that there is a 1/32\" crack in the piece of wood. You also notice that the crack has the same length as the piece on the left and the length on the right. Therefore, since you have to buy 1/2\" x 2 = $40 worth of wood, you know that you have to buy this type of wood because 1/2\"-1/.8\" is $40 worth and 1/2\"-2/.8\" is $50 worth. Therefore, if you use 1/2 length as the cheapest option, you would need to spend $40 on the cheapest wood and $50 on the cheapest wood.\nYou don\u2019t know if the crack is a 1/32 or a 1/16\" so you can only use the cheapest wood for the crack.

Let y be the total number of pairs of shoes that he wants to buy between now and Christmas. If he buys six pairs of shoes, then let y = 6*75 - 75/7 = 18. Let w be total purchases between now and Christmas. Let x' be the total number of items of shoes he wants this Christmas.\nJohn buys 15*18 = 18 additional pairs of shoes since last year.\nTherefore we have:\nJohn's total number of shoes in 2010 = 18 * 75/7 = 72\nJohn's total number purchased in 2010 = 72 * 75/7 = 360\nConclusion: John bought 3 pairs of shoes in 2009, 8 pairs of shoes in 2008, 12 pairs of shoes in 2007, and 11 pairs of shoes in 2006. He continued buying shoes in each year for five more years thereafter. Therefore he has bought 72 pairs of shoes in his lifetime. His total number of shoes is 360.

The stat is called what_number_of_errors_they_made.\nSince we can use the same formula to answer A and B, we look first for errors: <<10+10+10=40>>40 games.\nSince they keep track of errors, then we look first for happiness: <<10+10<-10=30>>30 games.\nSince they know they made more than 30 errors, then we look for sore muscles: <<10+<-10>10=20>>20 games.\nSince they only keep track of errors, we look first for injury: <<10>10<-10=10>>10 games.\nSince they mostly keep track of errors, they look first for perfection: <<<10>10<-7>10>10 = 10>>10 games.\nTherefore, we have: <<<10%>>10 = 10>>10 = 10\nTherefore, the final answer is 10%\n\nInput: Nino (the baby) weighed 1 pound, 13 ounces, in the first week of life. He weighed 2 pounds, 13 ounces, during the next week. Which baby is bigger\u2014in the first week, or the next week?\nOutput: We compare the first and second weeks. According to Nino's birth date, he was born on February 18, 2012. Therefore, we conclude that the baby is bigger in the first week than the second week.\nSince we can't see the baby's weight, so we can't use Nino's birth date as evidence, we use the next week birth date number:\nNino was born on Friday. His birth date, 4/18, is Saturday, February 24. So he is bigger in the first weekend than the second week. On Sunday morning, according to Nino's birthdate, he is 11 pounds, 13 ounces. So he is bigger for the first weekend than the next. On Monday morning, according to Nido's birthdate, he has 13 pounds, 13 ounces. He is bigger for the first day than the second day.\nTherefore, we find that the baby is bigger for the first week that is in the second weekend than the next:\nNino's first birthday is in October 24, 2012\n\nInput: After you are done teaching a lesson, you talk to someone and talk about how you liked today's lesson.\nOutput: you ask your teacher if it was good", "answer": "E: errors"}

How many places will the $20 bill go after it is in the box?\nOutput: Let y = the number of places in the box.\nLet x = the number of bills in the box.\nx = x + 1\nWe know x = 1, so the value of y can only be $60.\nSince x = 1/2, the value of y also must be $60.\nTherefore, y = $55+$60 = $85. Since we know that $85 \u2248 $60, y = $85.\nThe total number of places the $20 bill goes is x + y = y + 1 = x + y = y-1\nThe total number of bills that make the total of $85 is 2 + y = 0\nSo the final answer for #5 (y + 1, x + y + y) = $95\n\nInput: Alice met two young men at a bus stop.

{"text": "One of the things he can do to make more money is to own a house -- because he can live in one, drive in one, and store in one. Also, he can get better job with better pay: he may get raises for working longer or harder, and so he may not need to work as long hours or as much. It's also possible to buy more house because he can increase the price of his house if he wants to sell it faster. And if he owns a newer house, he can sell it faster in the market. Or he can invest in a business and get rich. If he doesn't own a business, he is free to sell things he needs, not things he wants. Finally, he can increase his income by increasing the price of his house: If he is able to sell enough for his needs, he can increase his house.\nHe can also get a better job: he can work hard to improve his skills and be promoted if he so desires.

What would he do with the extra $80 he would earn from the sale of his mother's home?\nTotal: $80/10 = $150\nSo the total of money borrowed from family and friends and used on the house, combined with the $150 that John earned from riding his bicycle to work, paid off the loan by $150.  John made $150 + $150 = $400.  If he would have bought a bike instead of borrowed money from his mom, John would have had $2 for every $100 borrowed.

If this song contains a second \u201cPaul\u201d word, I can say it three times in each choice, then get the correct answer.\nIf my choice is \u201cAll The Stars,\u201d then I say \u201cPaul\u201d three times in the first turn, and choose a song with a second \u201cPaul.\u201d I go back into All The Stars and tell Paul that I have the song name, and choose \u201cFrozen\u201d as the number 2 song. After this, I choose the song \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d as the second choice, and choose the wrong answer. If I choose \u201cFrozen,\u201d you could say \u201cPaul\u2019s\u201d three times in each choice: \u201cIf", "answer": "A: coffee"}

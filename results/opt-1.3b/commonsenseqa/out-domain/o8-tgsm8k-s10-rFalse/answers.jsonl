For fried foods,  I'm assuming you wouldn't want to go up to a fraternity house, or if you did, you wouldn't have to watch your calorie intake by much.\n\nB: Plane?  Sounds like a trip that gets you more \"wet\".  I'm fairly sure you would need to watch your calorie intake to avoid any vomiting.\n\nC: Beer?  I guess some places sell booze on planes.  And as for eating on a plane, I'd assume that you could get by with a diet of potato chips while cruising at about the 35000-4000' level, and if you wanted to, you could have a meal on the airplane that was still low-fat even as a fast food joint, such as McDonald's or Burger King, that would be low-fat enough you wouldn't be counting it.  But even being able to eat something that isn't low-fat can have a very negative impact on your diet, and if you do eat something high in fat, it would be worth noting you're eating at a fast-food joint rather than a sit-down place.  Of course, you could also try to bring your own snack/meal kit and eat it for an extended period of time.\n\nD: fraternity house?  What the hell is that?  It sounds like it could be fun, but you might only get to party in the evenings, so you'd probably have to stick around in the mornings, too.  And if you do get to take off early, you should make sure you watch your calories for the first 2-3 hours of your flight.\n\nE: Fraternity House?  I'm still not sure if that place exists, and if it does, how is it possible that they're a fraternity, but not affiliated with some sort of large corporation that has an office or campus somewhere?  If we had a corporate sponsor such as a car dealer, and if the car had a brand, then this would be a company, but even then, it seems the company would buy itself.  If we didn't have a corporate sponsor, we would have to just be a fraternity that didn't have an office, which still doesn't make sense to me.\n\nF: Beer?

{"text": "40\n\nInput: Each year the farmers harvest an average of 1.5 tons of grain (a ton means 5.2 pounds). The average weight of the grain is 2 pounds per pound and the average length of grain is 32 inches. They can harvest 2,320 tons of grain this year.  The farmers can save 1,400 tons of grain by using a machine to cut the grain into equal sized pieces. If they had a machine they could harvest 2,720 tons of grain this year, saving an average of 16 tons of grain per year.  If they had a machine that could harvest 1,550 tons of grain per year, then they could save 17 tons of grain per year by using 5.5 machines. They can save 10,700 tons of grain in total by using 6 machines.  If they used 7 machines, then they could easily save 20,000 tons of grain per year  and therefore save about $2,840 a year.  If they used 10 machines, they could easily save $4,000 a year by saving 25 tons of grain per year each year.  They would save an average of $8,000 per year if they used 21 machines.  If they bought and installed 18 machines it would cost $25,000, which is less than one third of the $30,000 a machine costs.  They can save 30 tons of grain per year with a machine.

{"text": "10 out of 10\n\nInput: Dennison was a successful doctor in his day and his patients all made do with his budget.  Then one day, he was in his office working on a medical issue when he came across an article about how much each type of food cost when it was going to a doctor's office.  He then went through his paper files looking for receipts on foods that he had charged his patients.  He found that at least 80% of every dollar that a patient had paid was for food in some form.  Dennison decided to check up on this information to see if he could be less wasteful.  He then went to the hospital on the 10th anniversary of the article and found out that the costs per patient were almost exactly double what it had been in his day.  Dennison then set a goal to find out how much the same food would cost to buy for each year in his day by putting a value on every food bill and comparing the cost of the present food bills to the cost of their previous bills.  After 5 years, Dennison realized that his bill was a staggering $50 billion dollars, or 7.5% of their annual revenue.  Dennison set a goal for himself to get to a level where his total was just 1/30th of his annual revenue.  Denny set a goal of $1.00 to spend on a bill and after several years of saving 5 cents a day, Denny eventually saved enough that he could afford his food bill.  He went from spending more on food bills himself to receiving 6% of his annual budget as the food bill.  After several more years, Denny was able to reduce the food bill by a further 1/4.  With the new food bill of $300,000 a month, Dennison was able to eliminate all his extra costs, save a lot of extra money, provide better service, and to have a healthier office.  He went from operating at the loss of $800,000 dollars to operating at $7.3 million dollars.  After 5 years of this, Dennison realized a goal that he would like to reach, and he was able to do it by reaching 40% of his annual revenue.\nOutput: 12 out of 10\n\nA: a hospital B: a hospital C:  a hotel D: a hospital E: a clinic G: a clinic\n\nA: the bill for the billable hours C: the bill", "answer": "A: school"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput: Tom is a writer for the Seattle Times whose father was a carpenter and who grew up in the city. Tom spent his early life going to work at Sears Roebuck & Co. Every day, he and his father picked up a new job to supplement their income. Tom's father was fired in 1956 and the two stopped work at the company. Tom worked in the mailroom at a paper company a few years before getting in the auto industry. His wife's family was originally Scottish and therefore not from the United States. He learned about the U.S. from watching the BBC and PBS. His father is not aware that Tom got a job at the auto industry, or that Tom has a background in car construction. He has no knowledge about his wife's family background except that she was raised Catholic in Ireland. He also has no knowledge of other family members. He met his wife, Janet, at a bar in New York City. He was there when she was hired by GM as a manager in 1973. They married the following year. Tom's wife was in her first year of college for pre-med. They planned to move to Detroit to be closer to her family. Unfortunately, Janet was too ill at the time and the couple ultimately split up. Tom has no idea what was going on at the time, but thinks Janet must either have gotten pregnant or lost her job in order to return to school after the separation. Janet's family was originally from Scotland and therefore not from the U.S. They were not familiar with the U.S. to the same extent that Tom's family was. She has not spoken to her family for over 25 years. In 1998, Janet got a call from a representative from GM and received a job offer. She accepted and, at the time, Tom was a vice president at a financial company. Tom is a member of American Legion Post 382.

{"text": "Example (3)\n\nSolution:The total cost to fill the tank is $5.00. The total cost to refill it is $4.00. Therefore, John's prices were $10.00 for three kilograms of nuts and $12.00 for four kilograms of nuts. The per-unit price of nuts is $1.40 and the per-unit price of dried fruits is $2.40. Therefore, he paid $24.00 for three kilos of nuts. The total cost to fill the truck is $5.00 and the total cost to refill it will be $4.00. The total price to fill the truck is therefore $20.00. Therefore, James will pay a total of $60.00 for the truck ($4.00 / $16.00 / $20.00 or $60.00 / $144.00 or $60 / $216.00). The per-unit price for each item was $20.00 and the total price is therefore $360.00\n\nIf, on the other hand, he had bought three kilos of nuts and four kilograms of dried fruits and put one kilo of nuts in each box and put two kilos of dried fruits in each box, he would have bought the same number of kilos for $8.00. On the other hand, if he had bought two kilos of nuts and six kilograms of dried fruits and two kilos of nuts in each box, he costed $16.00 by selling the extra two kilos of nuts.\n\nOutput: 60\n\nInput: There are two people who each work at a company for four hours and each have a weekly pay rate of $36.00.

Each first year student will be in the class of their same grade level and they will share materials and use the same subjects.

They ask the following questions:     * Are you getting your students to communicate clearly and with authority?     * Do you have good relationships with your students and are you a good listener?      Are their expectations appropriate?     Do you communicate and share ideas with students in a way that helps students move forward in their learning?     The only answer teachers receive is \"no\".

A person who is trying to make a ball of strings spin will need to use one hundred times the tension he would use if he were making it from scratch.  A person who attempts to make a ball of balls spin will need to use ten times the tension if he were trying to make it from scratch.  If the person wants to increase the tension on the string, try using 100 times more tension than he would put in if he were trying to start out from scratch.  If he puts the tension on 1,000 times more than he would, for example, if he wanted the string to spin ten times more, then he doubles the tension to 1000 times.  If he decides that the amount of tension he is using is just too low, then he tries ten times the tension.  The more weight he spreads over the string, of course the harder it falls to the floor.  He might decide to increase the tension ten times.  If he finds out that the string is really not spinning at all, then he makes another increase by ten times more.  If he finds that the string is spinning so fast that he can no longer even see it, then he makes a further increase in tension ten times as much.  After increasing ten times in the process, he decides that he needs to get the string on the floor as quickly as possible.  He tries one hundred times the tension then, and another ten times.  Finally after trying on one hundred times, he is able to put his finger on the string that he is using to try spinning, and as the weight increases on that string, it is able to actually spin without the aid of any other string.  When he uses that string that is spinning, he has only one choice:  he must increase the tension ten times again.  If he does that until he gets the desired results, then he does not have to go in for any more increments in the tension.  If he does not get the desired results he must try to reduce the tension ten times, but he could not increase it much beyond that.  If it takes him one thousand to try one hundred times to get the desired results each time, he has to do some further experimentation to try several thousand more times than that before he finds the one string that makes more progress than all the other strings by far, while also keeping", "answer": "D: power down"}

The decorations and lights are sparkling, and the turkeys are singing. But one of my absolute favorite holiday traditions is the Thanksgiving dinner! A week before Thanksgiving, we have turkey in the house. There are a lot of people here and some people like stuffing, but not too many of us like turkey.\nA lot of people talk about putting a lot of time and work into a turkey. They try to make sure that it is just right: it is perfectly cooked, the stuffing is nice and moist, and some people try to put in just the right amount of cranberry sauce to make sure that it has a wonderful flavor. But it is all for nothing if the turkey isn't actually tasty!\nWhen preparing a turkey, you want to make sure that the turkey is cooked well and well done.

{"text": "300\nAnswer: trading floor\n\nInput: Mary bought 5 kg, or 13 ounces, of nuts. The price of nuts went from $6.00 to $8.00, so Mary\u2019s purchase cost her $100.00. How would this amount be adjusted in inflation if it were expressed using the purchasing power of $100?Output: 100\n\nInput: Tom had 3kg of nuts in his shopping cart. Adam purchased 3kg of nuts at $4.00 per kilogram. They spent $50.00 each and the total would be $75.00. How much does their purchase cost if it was expressed using the dollar as money?Output: 100\nExample: The average price of wheat was $3.85, and the average price of beef was $4.20 in April 2003. The average price of oil was $28.50 per barrel. The average price of corn was $4.50 per bushel. Each of these prices represent prices in the year 2003. The price of wheat would be $6.85 per kg and corn $4.80 per bushel in 2005.\nOutput: 100\n\nOutput: Tom bought 20 kg, or 44 ounces, of nuts. One kg of nuts cost $5.00. He and Adam bought a second package, which cost $4.00. Since the nuts cost exactly the same both times, their portion was $20.00. How much would their portion be if it were expressed using their purchasing power?Output: 44\nExample: The average cost of a single case of bananas as of 2005 was approximately $1.37. Each kilogram cost 0.78 cents. The average price of a single case of fresh bananas as of 2005 was $1.37. The average price of bananas as of 2004 was $1.10 per case. The current average price of a kilogram of fresh bananas is 0.85 cents. Since average bananas cost the same as kilogram bananas in 2004, the average price of one kilogram of bananas was only $1.37 in the same year.\nExample: Tom purchased 5kg of almonds. Adam purchased 5kg of almonds at the same price as Tom. They spent $60.00. How much did their purchase cost, expressed as money, if it was expressed using their purchasing power of $60?Output: 60\nExample: Tom purchased 3kg of almonds.

The NCES is an investigative division of the USDA's National Center for Education Statistics. The report contained an overview of the recent changes in dieting and the overall impact on the nation's nutrition. To calculate the changes, the NCES looked at food price inflation, the weight loss rates between 1989\u201390 and the latest year for data. The data from the NCES showed that more women began eating clean diets during the 1990s in response to consumer campaigns and the growing focus on dieting and body image. The study revealed that women in the 1990s were consuming three fewer calories a day and lost 30 pounds each decade. Some states actually saw an increase in the number of overweight and obese people following clean eating, but there were also a number of states that lost more overweight and obese people and maintained a decreasing percentage of obese people. One can use the data from the NCES to decide whether or not eating clean is worth it and whether women can be influenced to adopt clean eating programs.\nInput: 3.1 ounces of 1-oz. cans vs. 24 ounces of 24 ounces\noutput: 100+\n\nInput: The size of a 24-oz. soda can is 4.5 inches wide by 3 inches long by 4 inches high.

{"text": "4\nAnswer: E\nExplanation:\n\nSOCIAL EDUCATION SOCIAL EDUCATION SOCIETY SOCIETY\n\nSOCIAL AND THE SOCIALISTS\n\nSocialists\nSocialists and revolutionaries are engaged in social struggle\nbecause they feel that their ideas can have an influence on both the\nstate and the class, but to be influential they need more means than the\nstate offers in fighting oppression. Since the government\nlack of means means that most of the people do not get the chance of\nfacing the oppression, socialists take to the streets.\n\nSOCIALISM\n\nSocialism is to the working class what Communism is to the proletariat.\nSocialism is the belief that the working class has a right to an autonomous\nclassless state.\n\nSocialism is a method of organizing the working class. In reality, it is the organization of the working class by its leaders or its trade union organization. Unlike Communists, Communists are not activists and have little influence outside of the Communist Party and the Red Army. Socialists work with and for the working class.\n\nSocial democracy is very broad and includes a variety of policies but is primarily concerned with programs which assist the needs of the oppressed; education, health care, housing and job creation. The term is used to refer to governments, political parties, social welfare organizations and even individual countries with a strong democracy.\n\nSocial democratic policies are more focused on the needs of the working class and may not be as developed or as developed as communism and social reformism.\n\nSocial democracy was established as a result of the struggles of the oppressed nations of the 20th century to maintain their national identity and their unity. This was achieved through organizations such as the United Nations, the League of Nations and its successor institutions, the European Economic Community and the International Monetary Fund, etc.\n\nAfter World War Two, social democratic governments around the world gained power as they offered greater equality to the oppressed. Socialism and social democracy have been considered complementary since both rely on the same goals.\n\nSocialism cannot be considered a form of government. It is a plan by the working class to unite and organize itself to gain a greater share of the profits and material goods. A form of socialism would be the government of the working class itself.\n\nCommunism can be seen as a form of socialism. Both share the main goal of ending the oppression of the proletariat by the class ruled government. Communist governments, while", "answer": "E: school"}

{"text": "3 (Choose 1)\n\nThe answer key:\nInput - Each player on the team scores 5 goals on the field but only 3 on the field the stadium.\nOutput - The total of all the goals scored in all the games is 30. If the total number of goals in the league that season is 300, then 20% of it are scored by Barca.\nInput - The total number of goals scored against Barca is 300, so 20% of them are scored by the other teams.\nOutput - 20% of 300 means 20% of 300 equals 120. Therefore 120 times 80 is 1260. So the total number of shots on target is 960. The number of shots at goal is 1200. That puts the total number of shots made by the team at 1760. Therefore the total number of shots saved by the team is 1720. That means the team had 1720 shots saved. The team scored 1150 goals. 1250 is 20% of which means 2000. Therefore the total number goals scored in the league so the total number goals won by the team are 300. Therefore the total number matches the total number of goals won by the team. 20/30 = 60%. 60 is 3/6. Thus the total number of league wins by the team is 300. That means the team has 60% won the league.\nOutput - The amount of the players' wages that goes back into the club is 60% of 300, or about $360. The amount goes back into the club to finance the team. 15% makes up the rest of the money. That is about $440, or $240. So the total wage bill is $360/1000 = $240 per player. In other words, the team can pay $1260/1250 = $16 per player. The total total cost of the team is $1200/1300 = $2 per player per year. Therefore the team has $2400 per year to spend on players.\nOutput - 30/300 = 3. If 30 times 3 is 60 then the total number of goals is 120. If the total number is 300 then all the goals scored against Barca would be 30. The team has 20% goals scored against Barca. 30/300 is 3/30 = 10%. Hence 60% (6 - 10%) = 15%. The team therefore plays a total of 300 games. There will be 32 different players on the team this season. Therefore there will be 120 goals scored against Barca each season", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

The numbers range from 1,000 in 1995 to 12,000 in 2014.  It is clear that the higher the average age, the more marriages are being performed per year.  If the average age is 30,000 (the median, which is approximately 30,000) and the average age of a marriage is 50,000, the number of marriages per year becomes 21,000/50,000, for an average of 20,000 per year.   If the average age of marriage is 40,000 (which is the average, i.e. 29,000 - 40,000) then the above average should be 21,000/20,000  instead, it is 21,000/29,000, for an increase of 28.6 %.  This is very different from what happens with the median age.  The median marriage age grows from 27.3 and decreases as you get older than 30 years.  The following graph shows the trend in median marriage ages in the U.S.  If the graph is increasing, the trend in marriage ages is up, the trend in median marriage age is down, and the median marriage ages are close to each other. So, it would appear that marriage may be improving but it does not improve by 28.6 %, instead it is stable.\nInput: Total marriage age\nOutput: Total Marriage Age 1,000 marriages per year\nOutput: Median Total Marriage Age 3,000 Per year\nOutput: Median total marriage age 3,000 per year\n\nInput:An Italian couple has 10 children.

{"text": "45\n\nInput: An engineer buys a new engine with a warranty of 12 years. The engine makes 18,000 miles per year, so the engineer expects it to last until it is sold. There are 150,000 miles left on the 12-year warranty, plus 500,000 miles of operating mileage. The engine manufacturer expects that on average the engine gets 2,000 miles of additional life out of the engine based on normal operating wear and tear. If the mechanic tells him that the engine only needs 1,000 miles of additional oiling life, the owner can expect to pay $150.00 for the engine. The mechanic can be willing to charge the owner for the additional oiling because she can see that the engine is getting old. The mechanic can be unwilling to charge the owner for another 1,000 miles of oiling because she realizes the additional cost. The mechanic is the owner's friend. She can be told that the engine is already in bad condition. The mechanic can also be willing to tell the owner that his opinion on the cost of the engine can change in the future if the engine ends up requiring more repairs and upgrades. If the mechanic charges the owner more than $150 for the additional oiling, she can choose to take the engine back to the shop and return it to him for inspection or for her money back.

At the next stop sign, the driver sees that there are only two other lanes to go in. A left turn to go south is forbidden and also illegal because it causes too much traffic. However, it is not illegal to turn right to go south because there is no other way to go south before hitting the U-turn. The driver makes it onto the only lane before stopping in front of a construction zone to wait for the traffic stop to end. At the next U-turn, the driver decides to accelerate to the maximum speed and makes a U-turn to the north at the third stop sign. He then gets in the left lane to hit the next stop sign. He then speeds right through the third stop sign. Finally, he reaches the first traffic light and realizes that the traffic is moving too slow to safely pass. A right turn to return back west is possible and he follows it. He then completes a full circle and is now heading in the direction he was originally going. A second right turn into the eastbound lanes is not possible because the streets connect by only one way for miles and at best five lanes.

How many hours do you spend lifting weights?\nOutput : 4\n\n#4\n\ninput: You must fuel your plane by refueling it with gas. How many gallons of gas do you carry?\nOutput : 480\n\n$12 per kilogram of nuts\n\n$7.95 per kilogram of dried fruit\n\n$8.80 per kilogram of nuts plus $8.40 per kilogram of dried fruits\n\nYour average dollar cost per kilogram of nuts and dried fruit and\nyour average dollar cost per kilo of nuts and nuts plus $20 per kilo of dried fruit and\n$17 per kilo of nuts. It\u2019s clear to see that the average dollar cost per kilos of nuts is higher than the average dollar cost per kg of nuts and dried fruit. And at the same time, the average dollar cost per grams of nuts and dried fruit is lower than the average dollar cost of grams of nuts and dried fruits. Your cost ratios are clear and more than satisfactory.\n\nExamining the other answers, we find that there are very few values lower than 12 for the dollar cost of nuts and dried fruit while very few values higher than $7 for $12 for nuts and dried fruit.

Some names are already familiar; The Dark Tower is based on \"The Dark Knight\" by Christopher Nolan, The Hunger Games is based on \"The Hunger Games\" by Suzanne Collins, and the Hunger Games: Catching Fire follows \"Catching Fire\" by Suzanne Collins. There are a few other authors who have also made movies based on their novels, but the majority that have had a movie made are either the Twilight series, the Harry Potter series (although Harry Potter was made in 3 parts) or the Twilight movies. These three series are popular, and the other ones are more popular as well, so it is understandable why they have had movies made.\n\nThe Hunger Games movies had mixed reviews among the general public, but still succeeded with the adults who read and watched the books. \"Fifty Shades Darkr\" came about after the success of the Hunger Games, and has already made a lot of money for the studios, so they are planning to continue the series and make a lot of money. The movie has received mixed reviews and low-quality reviews. The rating for the Hunger Games movies, and then the rating for \"Darker\", are a success in terms of gross revenue, but in terms of entertainment (including the movies), they do not hold up to the quality of other movies like \"Star Wars\".\n\nThe movie is not a popular series because it does not have much substance to it. The story is repetitive, and everything that happens in the first three movies, the first three acts of the novel also end up in the movie. The movie seems to be very simplistic, and it lacks the development that the book had. At the end of the book, the characters go into a new world that the movie makes seem like \"Groundhog Day\", where all of the events are the same, but it adds nothing to the books. Overall, if you were to read \"Fifty Shades Dark\" and not see \"Fifty Shades Dark\", the book would do nothing to advance the series, but if you're a fan of the series, then this movie is a decent rip-off.", "answer": "D: africa"}

{"text": "a\n\nOutput: If Adam has $1000 to invest and earns a dollar a day, John and Elijah have $500 to invest and earn a dollar a day. Therefore, the total amount Adam spends will be $1000 - $500 = $2000. However, John and Elijah won\u2019t be able to spend that much money on each purchase.  In order to get a dollar a day from Adam, John and Elijah would need to buy a total of 12 goods and sell 10 goods. Using our example, they would need to sell 20 widgets in order to get $1000. If, instead, John and Elijah spent their entire investment and earned $1000, they would still be able to spend their entire investment and only earn $1000 on 10 goods. Therefore, they would only spend $1000 in total and take home $2000.  The difference is not made up for because the number of goods sold per year has been doubled, which means there were only 80 goods sold per year last year before the $500 investment and $2000 investment. However, there were 160 goods and workers in 2009 and 120 goods and workers in 2000. In order to take home $2000 twice as much this year because of the doubling the total number of goods sold will need to be at 40. In order to earn $2000 this year, John and Elijah would have to earn $1500 on 40 goods.

Once you have all your credits paid in full, the loan is only $6.50/month. In this example, you have a $10,000 loan. In order for you to not pay any interest, you would need to pay $30,000. (This is a loan with a variable interest rate; after you make the $6.50/year payment, your interest will rise from 3% to 9%. Also, you have to pay full principal because your loan can only be paid up to 90 days after the loan goes into the default category.) So with a $10,000 principal, you would still pay the same $300 in interest that you would have paid for the initial $10,000 with a $200 minimum payment. In this example, if your loan is paid on time, it is actually better to have an additional small loan to pay the $500 minimum payments. If you are paying on time, you actually have no money, you are just borrowing from yourself. In this example, it would seem that you could go without food, or use all the money you saved for other purposes and live. It is far more important to maintain your credit rating. You should have thought about this before you signed the loan. And you should have taken the loan out of a different account. In this example, your friend should have taken the money out of her account; it would be much more cost efficient and there is no guarantee that she would have access to the same credit line. Therefore, she should not have signed a $10,000 unsecured loan. Also, this is not a good time for her to be borrowing $10,000; therefore, she should have a job. In this example you will now pay $300 to keep your credit from going down. How can you repair your credit?\nOutput: B\n\nOutput:There are 7,000 students in the local high school.

He had surgery to restore his thumb, which allowed him to work at the office until he could get back a normal-sized hand. When Bill got home, he noticed that his thumb was swollen. He went to the doctor because he thought his thumb was broken, but his thumb was merely swollen. Later, Bill noticed that his thumb was red.  His doctor said that the swelling would clear up over time. Bill's thumb began to swell, and this time he made a doctor's appointment.  At the doctor's office, Bill's thumb turned red and swollen again.  He scheduled an appointment at an outpatient dermatology practice, but Bill's swelling increased so much that the doctor scheduled an emergency appointment. At his appointment, Bill's thumb became a dark color, and the doctor finally gave him a prescription for Tylenol 3. When Bill got home from the doctor's office, he noticed that his hand and thumb had returned to their normal color and that the swelling had completely gone away.  Bill's surgeon decided that Bill could not fix the thumb himself so he had Bill undergo an operation to sew a pin in Bill's broken finger and restore his hand to normal size.\nOutput: 1200+\n\nInput: In the movie \"The Ice Storm\", John goes to the dentist with his mom to get a filling.

We told our friends in the apartment building that we were expecting kids and that we wanted to make sure that none of them would be staying here. Our friends were very happy to see us.  David and I both worked full-time during that period of time, so we did not sleep in the same room. We both rented rooms in the building. As time passed, some of David's friends came out of the building and asked how they could help us with raising our kids. When we mentioned that we needed some money for our parents to care for the kids at certain times, David's friends offered to pay for these occasional costs. One of his friends even gave us a free bike. My friends often invited us out and to movies, restaurants, festivals, and parks so that we could see their babies. I still remember the first time we went to a park with two little girls, we walked around in the park for hours and enjoyed the outdoors with our kids. The children of the people who lived in the building often threw birthday parties for us. One birthday party brought a whole bunch of cookies, so we were able to get extra calories from that. I also remember how one day some of the kids threw me a bike. The bike was nice, but I do not remember if it was free or paid for. Over the years my apartment has become less and less of a place of family fun. Some of these friends have moved. A few friends still live in the building, but due to the baby issue, most are single and never have the chance to be out and about with their children. I feel sad for all the kids because my favorite ones are the young ones that still come over and play with me or take me on a bike ride. I hope that someday our kids will feel the same way towards us.\nInput: 0", "answer": "D: museum of natural history"}

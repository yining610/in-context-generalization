They have a quota of 100 cigarettes a day to get at their goal.  If the quota is met, then there are no sales.  If, on the other hand, the quota is reached, then there are sales.  The quota is reached once, and the quota is not reached, twice, and once more.<n>Output: 110<n>input: If we take the ratio of sales per dollar to the market value of all cigarettes in America, we get  1.25x<n>output: The difference from  1,  2,  3, and  4<n>input: So in a market-value sense, only 4 packs of cigarettes was sold for $2.04.

Choices:  A: pub B: plane C: beer D: store E: fraternity house<n>Output:		 1,000<n><n>Comments:<n><n>A: Alcohol?  Sounds like a good day for a bender.  Beer?  You'll want to watch your calorie intake.  For fried foods,  I'm assuming you wouldn't want to go up to a fraternity house, or if you did, you wouldn't have to watch your calorie intake by much.<n><n>B: Plane?  Sounds like a trip that gets you more "wet".  I'm fairly sure you would need to watch your calorie intake to avoid any vomiting.<n><n>C: Beer?  I guess some places sell booze on planes.  And as for eating on a plane, I'd assume that you could get by with a diet of potato chips while cruising at about the 35000-4000' level, and if you wanted to, you could have a meal on the airplane that was still low-fat even as a fast food joint, such as McDonald's or Burger King, that would be low-fat enough you wouldn't be counting it.  But even being able to eat something that isn't low-fat can have a very negative impact on your diet, and if you do eat something high in fat, it would be worth noting you're eating at a fast-food joint rather than a sit-down place.  Of course, you could also try to bring your own snack/meal kit and eat it for an extended period of time.<n><n>D: fraternity house?  What the hell is that?  It sounds like it could be fun, but you might only get to party in the evenings, so you'd probably have to stick around in the mornings, too.  And if you do get to take off early, you should make sure you watch your calories for the first 2-3 hours of your flight.<n><n>E: Fraternity House?  I'm still not sure if that place exists, and if it does, how is it possible that they're a fraternity, but not affiliated with some sort of large corporation that has an office or campus somewhere?  If we had a corporate sponsor such as a car dealer, and if the car had a brand, then this would be a company, but even then, it seems the company would buy itself.  If we didn't have a corporate sponsor, we would have to just be a fraternity that didn't have an office, which still doesn't make sense to me.<n><n>F: Beer?  A lot of beers are around 200 calories

Every day at 10 hours, one player is designated the leader of the team and takes on the role of captain. This player must ensure that everyone is healthy and in good spirits. When they are all healthy and in good spirits, it is a great day. When a player sees the Captain, he or she must praise that player for taking on the leadership role. When someone is not getting praise for doing his fair share of housework, this is cause for a little bit of a temper tantrum. Other things the Captain does is monitor the time players spend at the table and keep track of who has to pay for a meal (the loser is the one who has to pay for the meal), when people drink, and when people are getting bored. In addition, some of these things are done in private. These actions are done so that the players themselves and the fans of the league appreciate what the players do even more. At the end of the season

Lonnie went outside to find Ann had left a child sized pail with her garbage.

When she was done, she discovered that she had to pay $100.00 plus the 10 cent admission fee to the funeral home for her and her children to have their remains cremated and buried at Lakeland-Davie Memorial Gardens.

On her way home, Lonnie noticed a child with her, so she asked Ann where her babies are.  Ann informed her that she had taken them out to play in the yard, which she said she was just doing while they were outside. Ann then asked Lonnie if she would like them to look at her flower garden, so she took the children to view several flowers which she had been working on.  When Lonnie returned home from the funeral service, she found two children who had been in the play area with Ann.  At that point

The inspector asked the builder how many homes he could build and if there was any problem with any of those houses.  The builder replied that it was not going to be possible for him to build any homes more than the 2,000 houses that he wanted to build. Since he did not have that much money, he asked the inspector if they could give him a loan that would cover the difference between the 2,000 and the 2,500 houses that he wanted to sell.  The building inspector said that they could not do that because the bank had already told him that he would not have the credit to handle more than the 2,500 houses he wanted to sell. The builder was very upset and asked the inspector for some time to think about his options. The inspector wrote down some options that the builder thought might help him sell his own home and the builder called his lawyer to tell the lawyer that although the bank had rejected the builder's loan request, he wanted to sell his own home because he felt that he would be able to pay off his debt of $80,000.00 if the bank loaned him the remaining $20,000.00 from the loan that he was rejected by the bank for. The lawyer asked that the lawyer inform the bank that the builder wanted to buy his own home so that he could refinance his $40,000.00 home and

The average weight of the grain is 2 pounds per pound and the average length of grain is 32 inches. They can harvest 2,320 tons of grain this year.  The farmers can save 1,400 tons of grain by using a machine to cut the grain into equal sized pieces. If they had a machine they could harvest 2,720 tons of grain this year, saving an average of 16 tons of grain per year.  If they had a machine that could harvest 1,550 tons of grain per year, then they could save 17 tons of grain per year by using 5.5 machines. They can save 10,700 tons of grain in total by using 6 machines.  If they used 7 machines, then they could easily save 20,000 tons of grain per year  and therefore save about $2,840 a year.  If they used 10 machines, they could easily save $4,000 a year by saving 25 tons of grain per year each year.  They would save an average of $8,000 per year if they used 21 machines.  If they bought and installed 18 machines it would cost $25,000, which is less than one third of the $30,000 a machine costs.  They can save 30 tons of grain per year with a machine.  If they could buy one machine they would save $35,000.  If they bought 18 machines they would still be saving $50,000 since each machine costs $50,000.<n>Output: 5<n><n>Input: If 1,500 people work on this project, the total cost is $500,000.

The song that comes up in the Internet radio's search function is Billy Joel's "Singing in the Rain". The search engine also puts his name into the search box and tells him which song is most likely to come up. This computer-assisted technique of searching for music has not been tested in court and is not a valid source of information. Tom takes the CD, which has a good selection of songs, and is able to search with out using a search engine but also without knowing what the song is. The CD ends up with 15 different songs selected by computer assisted selection. The lyrics of the songs are not printed on the CD so Tom can't see what they say.

Then one day, he was in his office working on a medical issue when he came across an article about how much each type of food cost when it was going to a doctor's office.  He then went through his paper files looking for receipts on foods that he had charged his patients.  He found that at least 80% of every dollar that a patient had paid was for food in some form.  Dennison decided to check up on this information to see if he could be less wasteful.  He then went to the hospital on the 10th anniversary of the article and found out that the costs per patient were almost exactly double what it had been in his day.  Dennison then set a goal to find out how much the same food would cost to buy for each year in his day by putting a value on every food bill and comparing the cost of the present food bills to the cost of their previous bills.  After 5 years, Dennison realized that his bill was a staggering $50 billion dollars, or 7.5% of their annual revenue.  Dennison set a goal for himself to get to a level where his total was just 1/30th of his annual revenue.  Denny set a goal of $1.00 to spend on a bill and after several years of saving 5 cents a day, Denny eventually saved enough that he could afford his food bill.  He went from spending more on food bills himself to receiving 6% of his annual budget as the food bill.  After several more years, Denny was able to reduce the food bill by a further 1/4.  With the new food bill of $300,000 a month, Dennison was able to eliminate all his extra costs, save a lot of extra money, provide better service, and to have a healthier office.  He went from operating at the loss of $800,000 dollars to operating at $7.3 million dollars.  After 5 years of this, Dennison realized a goal that he would like to reach, and he was able to do it by reaching 40% of his annual revenue.<n>Output: 12 out of 10<n><n>A: a hospital B: a hospital C:  a hotel D: a hospital E: a clinic G: a clinic<n><n>A: the bill for the billable hours C: the bill

Tom spent his early life going to work at Sears Roebuck & Co. Every day, he and his father picked up a new job to supplement their income. Tom's father was fired in 1956 and the two stopped work at the company. Tom worked in the mailroom at a paper company a few years before getting in the auto industry. His wife's family was originally Scottish and therefore not from the United States. He learned about the U.S. from watching the BBC and PBS. His father is not aware that Tom got a job at the auto industry, or that Tom has a background in car construction. He has no knowledge about his wife's family background except that she was raised Catholic in Ireland. He also has no knowledge of other family members. He met his wife, Janet, at a bar in New York City. He was there when she was hired by GM as a manager in 1973. They married the following year. Tom's wife was in her first year of college for pre-med. They planned to move to Detroit to be closer to her family. Unfortunately, Janet was too ill at the time and the couple ultimately split up. Tom has no idea what was going on at the time, but thinks Janet must either have gotten pregnant or lost her job in order to return to school after the separation. Janet's family was originally from Scotland and therefore not from the U.S. They were not familiar with the U.S. to the same extent that Tom's family was. She has not spoken to her family for over 25 years. In 1998, Janet got a call from a representative from GM and received a job offer. She accepted and, at the time, Tom was a vice president at a financial company. Tom is a member of American Legion Post 382. He serves on the executive board for the American Association of Retired Persons. He has a wife and two children. He spends one night a week at work at the company and one night a week at home at the family house. They both watch the same six channels: two hours of television, five days a week.<n>Output: 120<n><n>Input:John and Tom both went to school in San Diego. They also went to school in Seattle.

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n>Output:		<n><n>Example (3)<n><n>Solution:The total cost to fill the tank is $5.00. The total cost to refill it is $4.00. Therefore, John's prices were $10.00 for three kilograms of nuts and $12.00 for four kilograms of nuts. The per-unit price of nuts is $1.40 and the per-unit price of dried fruits is $2.40. Therefore, he paid $24.00 for three kilos of nuts. The total cost to fill the truck is $5.00 and the total cost to refill it will be $4.00. The total price to fill the truck is therefore $20.00. Therefore, James will pay a total of $60.00 for the truck ($4.00 / $16.00 / $20.00 or $60.00 / $144.00 or $60 / $216.00). The per-unit price for each item was $20.00 and the total price is therefore $360.00<n><n>If, on the other hand, he had bought three kilos of nuts and four kilograms of dried fruits and put one kilo of nuts in each box and put two kilos of dried fruits in each box, he would have bought the same number of kilos for $8.00. On the other hand, if he had bought two kilos of nuts and six kilograms of dried fruits and two kilos of nuts in each box, he costed $16.00 by selling the extra two kilos of nuts.<n><n>Output: 60<n><n>Input: There are two people who each work at a company for four hours and each have a weekly pay rate of $36.00.

A letter is distributed to every teacher and includes the following comments:      * "New students will be grouped together into two groups. Each first year student will be in the class of their same grade level and they will share materials and use the same subjects.  Second year students will be placed in classes similar to their grade levels.  For the first semester, teachers will use this time to reflect and work on individual lessons, develop lesson plans, and communicate with students in a more meaningful, open, and personal way."<n>       "Teachers will also be assigned the same students they have each taught for the past 3 years.  The focus will be to help foster relationships and develop close relationships with the individual students.  As a result of the changes this year, each teacher will receive a new assignment, and therefore, will be reevaluated based on their own evaluations.  "<n>    The school board then proceeds to evaluate the effectiveness of the "new year" teacher evaluations in terms not of content knowledge or knowledge of students, but of relationships with teachers.  They ask the following questions:     * Are you getting your students to communicate clearly and with authority?     * Do you have good relationships with your students and are you a good listener?      Are their expectations appropriate?     Do you communicate and share ideas with students in a way that helps students move forward in their learning?     The only answer teachers receive is "no".  There is no mention of "relationships". The only reason teachers are evaluated for content knowledge is not because of content knowledge, but because they have to "catch up".<n>    The next step is a yearly evaluation. The following comments are asked for in the "evaluations":      Why do you teach the new year curricula?     Why are you using new teacher lesson plans?     What changes will be made in the curriculum this year?     How will you use assessment to help us develop next year's curriculum?     Are you willing to meet with students to discuss individual lesson plans?   Is there feedback and positive interaction going on between students

John says he is okay with this and is willing to go without ice cream cones for a week.  The manager says he is sorry to ask him such a thing and offers to help him in any way he can. John says sure. Bob then tells John that he would never do anything like this for him.  They both laugh about it and say they were happy to have the chance to make this guy’s day (while still eating their food). John is then told that he will be getting ice cream cones, but only one. In addition to that, he will be getting a cookie from the same counter. The next store is also full of ice cream cones and Bob has a cookie. Finally he is asked to choose one of two other ice cream cones. John chooses the one with the frosting and eats it. Bob then has the option to choose between the other ice cream cones or a cookie. He chooses the cookie.  John then asks the manager if he would mind moving the counter from where they are standing. He is then told that moving it would be impossible. John tells him that he does not care and moves the bench to the side of the counter. Next, the manager tells John he has about 2 minutes to pick out a cookie from the remaining ice cream cones and tells him that he needs to choose very quickly because the remaining 3 ice cream cones were sold out.  John thinks the next thing the manager could have asked him to do is to ask him to clean the counter or wash his hands. He doesn’t bother to do that though because he decided to eat the cookie straight up.  As they are making their way to the counter, John tells him that it is “good to be Mr. Nice Guy”. They then pick out their cookies and leave the McDonalds. They then run into Mary Ann’s store and ask Mary Ann if she sells ice cream. Mary Ann says that she does, but will only sell to 5 people at a time. They ask her if they can take a couple of ice cream cone, instead of paying for their meal. Mary Ann then tells them that they could take a cookie and she would keep the ice cream for them.

At first, they planned to get a car and a place of their own so that they could travel between work and home. However, John's parents put off getting the house and car until their daughter was old enough to drive. In September, the couple celebrated their anniversary at the family home and went on a long drive of 500 miles.  Once home, Mary put the car and house in storage until her daughter could drive. In June, 1989, Mary began looking for a job so that they would have some spending money. She applied at several retail stores in the area, but none hire employees under the age of 21.  Mary eventually found a part-time job that paid $10.00 per hour, plus benefits.  Mary's paychecks include an extra two hours per work week to be "paid to sleep," and the rest to pay for her gas and car maintenance.   Mary makes $300.00 per week after taxes, plus $20.00 per week in child allowance, and a $50.00 weekly allowance for her daughter. When her daughter turns 16, Mary will receive another $50.00 per week until the family moves into the new house.  In a few years, Mary and John will be able to spend their savings. In 20 years, they will be able to move to the west coast and begin taking cruises to the Caribbean.  While her daughter is young, Mary will focus on learning all she can about computers, the new economy, health insurance, and getting ready to start a family.  Mary plans to teach her own daughter how to change oil in the next few years, and also want to set aside some money for her daughter to have a computer after she turns 16.  Mary anticipates that one of her daughter's friends may move to the southwest part of the state to go to college, or to work at a casino.  Mary wants the family to continue saving and having fun as they travel through life.  Mary also hopes that her daughter will continue to drive and to go to college.<n>Output: B<n>

A person who is trying to make a ball of strings spin will need to use one hundred times the tension he would use if he were making it from scratch.  A person who attempts to make a ball of balls spin will need to use ten times the tension if he were trying to make it from scratch.  If the person wants to increase the tension on the string, try using 100 times more tension than he would put in if he were trying to start out from scratch.  If he puts the tension on 1,000 times more than he would, for example, if he wanted the string to spin ten times more, then he doubles the tension to 1000 times.  If he decides that the amount of tension he is using is just too low, then he tries ten times the tension.  The more weight he spreads over the string, of course the harder it falls to the floor.  He might decide to increase the tension ten times.  If he finds out that the string is really not spinning at all, then he makes another increase by ten times more.  If he finds that the string is spinning so fast that he can no longer even see it, then he makes a further increase in tension ten times as much.  After increasing ten times in the process, he decides that he needs to get the string on the floor as quickly as possible.  He tries one hundred times the tension then, and another ten times.  Finally after trying on one hundred times, he is able to put his finger on the string that he is using to try spinning, and as the weight increases on that string, it is able to actually spin without the aid of any other string.  When he uses that string that is spinning, he has only one choice:  he must increase the tension ten times again.  If he does that until he gets the desired results, then he does not have to go in for any more increments in the tension.  If he does not get the desired results he must try to reduce the tension ten times, but he could not increase it much beyond that.  If it takes him one thousand to try one hundred times to get the desired results each time, he has to do some further experimentation to try several thousand more times than that before he finds the one string that makes more progress than all the other strings by far, while also keeping

Alice replied, "That's great, I'll give it a try." After another ten minutes of playing, Alice said, "I love your playing, it's so relaxing."

Alice said, "I'll try." He played the piece for a further 45 minutes, stopping every 20 minutes or so to ask, "Do you want to play a longer piece?"

In each case, whoever strikes first in the course of the match is the winner.  How many strikes will each of you make, and how many times will you advance to the next game?<n>Output: 30<n>I have played 3-D-Ball. Each player can play 3 balls once.  If you have the ball you can make an extra ball, a rebound or a shot that hits a wall.  If you don't have the balls you can get an extra ball for free from another player.  It is now your turn.  Try to make as many as possible, but don't try all of them; you can hit something if you make an extra ball, but that doesn't count as having made the ball.  The highest score in a match is 5 shots.  You can advance to a game if you are in the top 20. In addition, each player gets 10 points for a shot that goes into the corner; this counts as a shot and a 10-point extra for scoring a goal.<n>Output: 120<n><n>Input: Alice had to clean the basement floor.

The husband works long hours at his job in the military, but sometimes the boy and girl are so sleepy from not sleeping that he can go straight to bed without feeding them.  After school for dinner the night before, the wife says, "Let's get a nice dinner for tonight and cook it on the gas grill. Let's have spaghetti." (It was a nice dinner, but she cooked it on the gas grill.) The husband is very hungry for a few hours that night, so he eats a meal that is much bigger than the spaghetti. After dinner, the wife puts the 2 year old son down for a nap and the husband sits down beside him and cooks on the gas grill. The 3-year-old wakes up when the father is almost done and asks for some of the chicken that was on the grill. When the dad was just about done, he began to put some more chicken on the grill and said to the son, "Is it done?" The boy said, "Yes, your mom told us to. We made a big batch of spaghetti and we want some chicken to go with it." The son ate a big piece of the mother's spaghetti and began to eat the chicken her husband was cooking. About 30 minutes later, the 2 year old boy asked and was allowed to eat the meat that had been cooked on the gas grill. At the very end of the meal, there was still several pieces of chicken and the 2 year old asked if he could put them to use. The father thought it was a good idea to let the son use the chicken. So, when the 2 year old asked to eat some more, he allowed the son to put chicken to use. The father then put about 5 pieces of chicken to use. A while later, the 2 year-old decided that his parents had been cooking slowly and so he wanted to eat some pieces of chicken to eat. The father then put chicken to use. After this, the 2 year- old would eat as much of his mother's spaghetti as he wanted. Later the family sat down to eat some chicken and noodles with rice and broccoli. At the end of the meal, the 4-year-old, who had not had any noodles, ate the spaghetti with bread that had been cooked on an electric grill. At the beginning of the meal, the 3 year-old asked if he could eat

The two men with pistols are still fighting and he asks the man with the gun where he's from, but he gets nothing out of that.

The price of nuts went from $6.00 to $8.00, so Mary’s purchase cost her $100.00. How would this amount be adjusted in inflation if it were expressed using the purchasing power of $100?Output: 100<n><n>Input: Tom had 3kg of nuts in his shopping cart. Adam purchased 3kg of nuts at $4.00 per kilogram. They spent $50.00 each and the total would be $75.00. How much does their purchase cost if it was expressed using the dollar as money?Output: 100<n>Example: The average price of wheat was $3.85, and the average price of beef was $4.20 in April 2003. The average price of oil was $28.50 per barrel. The average price of corn was $4.50 per bushel. Each of these prices represent prices in the year 2003. The price of wheat would be $6.85 per kg and corn $4.80 per bushel in 2005.<n>Output: 100<n><n>Output: Tom bought 20 kg, or 44 ounces, of nuts. One kg of nuts cost $5.00. He and Adam bought a second package, which cost $4.00. Since the nuts cost exactly the same both times, their portion was $20.00. How much would their portion be if it were expressed using their purchasing power?Output: 44<n>Example: The average cost of a single case of bananas as of 2005 was approximately $1.37. Each kilogram cost 0.78 cents. The average price of a single case of fresh bananas as of 2005 was $1.37. The average price of bananas as of 2004 was $1.10 per case. The current average price of a kilogram of fresh bananas is 0.85 cents. Since average bananas cost the same as kilogram bananas in 2004, the average price of one kilogram of bananas was only $1.37 in the same year.<n>Example: Tom purchased 5kg of almonds. Adam purchased 5kg of almonds at the same price as Tom. They spent $60.00.

The NCES is an investigative division of the USDA's National Center for Education Statistics. The report contained an overview of the recent changes in dieting and the overall impact on the nation's nutrition. To calculate the changes, the NCES looked at food price inflation, the weight loss rates between 1989–90 and the latest year for data. The data from the NCES showed that more women began eating clean diets during the 1990s in response to consumer campaigns and the growing focus on dieting and body image. The study revealed that women in the 1990s were consuming three fewer calories a day and lost 30 pounds each decade. Some states actually saw an increase in the number of overweight and obese people following clean eating, but there were also a number of states that lost more overweight and obese people and maintained a decreasing percentage of obese people. One can use the data from the NCES to decide whether or not eating clean is worth it and whether women can be influenced to adopt clean eating programs.<n>Input: 3.1 ounces of 1-oz. cans vs. 24 ounces of 24 ounces<n>output: 100+<n><n>Input: The size of a 24-oz. soda can is 4.5 inches wide by 3 inches long by 4 inches high.

Since the government<n>lack of means means that most of the people do not get the chance of<n>facing the oppression, socialists take to the streets.<n><n>SOCIALISM<n><n>Socialism is to the working class what Communism is to the proletariat.<n>Socialism is the belief that the working class has a right to an autonomous<n>classless state.<n><n>Socialism is a method of organizing the working class. In reality, it is the organization of the working class by its leaders or its trade union organization. Unlike Communists, Communists are not activists and have little influence outside of the Communist Party and the Red Army. Socialists work with and for the working class.<n><n>Social democracy is very broad and includes a variety of policies but is primarily concerned with programs which assist the needs of the oppressed; education, health care, housing and job creation. The term is used to refer to governments, political parties, social welfare organizations and even individual countries with a strong democracy.<n><n>Social democratic policies are more focused on the needs of the working class and may not be as developed or as developed as communism and social reformism.<n><n>Social democracy was established as a result of the struggles of the oppressed nations of the 20th century to maintain their national identity and their unity. This was achieved through organizations such as the United Nations, the League of Nations and its successor institutions, the European Economic Community and the International Monetary Fund, etc.<n><n>After World War Two, social democratic governments around the world gained power as they offered greater equality to the oppressed. Socialism and social democracy have been considered complementary since both rely on the same goals.<n><n>Socialism cannot be considered a form of government. It is a plan by the working class to unite and organize itself to gain a greater share of the profits and material goods. A form of socialism would be the government of the working class itself.<n><n>Communism can be seen as a form of socialism. Both share the main goal of ending the oppression of the proletariat by the class ruled government. Communist governments, while

Art is “anything produced for the purpose of creating a work of art as recognized by international organizations and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.” “Music” has been defined a “musical form which is essentially the art of speech” (1). The word music can also be used in combination with “art.“ In an almost literal sense music is the expression of rhythm and sounds used to form phrases, but as a more general term it could also fit art and art-related. What artists are often called “artists” is an open question, one that has been raised in many different contexts, including popular culture, and art school. Some terms given as examples in popular culture, (“a famous artist”) have not actually meant anything more than the person who is famous, and have been used to describe any sort of creative endeavor. In art school many artists are known by these terms and are therefore called artists, but some of the students are simply known as students, or by other terms such as students of art.<n>Input: A: What should the train

She puts 3 widgets in each carton, which are 4 inches wide, 4 inches long, and 5 inches tall. She then packs those cartons into a shipping box before sending it to the loading bay. The shipping boxes are 20 inches wide, 20 inches long, and 20 inches high. How many widgets get shipped in each shipping box?<n>Output: 300<n><n>Input:What does playing soccer for a long time lead to? Choices:  A: excitement B: fatigue C: anger D: hurting E: getting tired<n>Output:		 3 (Choose 1)<n><n>The answer key:<n>Input - Each player on the team scores 5 goals on the field but only 3 on the field the stadium.<n>Output - The total of all the goals scored in all the games is 30. If the total number of goals in the league that season is 300, then 20% of it are scored by Barca.<n>Input - The total number of goals scored against Barca is 300, so 20% of them are scored by the other teams.<n>Output - 20% of 300 means 20% of 300 equals 120. Therefore 120 times 80 is 1260. So the total number of shots on target is 960. The number of shots at goal is 1200. That puts the total number of shots made by the team at 1760. Therefore the total number of shots saved by the team is 1720. That means the team had 1720 shots saved. The team scored 1150 goals. 1250 is 20% of which means 2000. Therefore the total number goals scored in the league so the total number goals won by the team are 300. Therefore the total number matches the total number of goals won by the team. 20/30 = 60%. 60 is 3/6. Thus the total number of league wins by the team is 300. That means the team has 60% won the league.<n>Output - The amount of the players' wages that goes back into the club is 60% of 300, or about $360. The amount goes back into the club to finance the team. 15% makes up the rest of the money. That is about $440, or $240. So the total wage bill is $360/1000 = $240 per player. In other words, the team can pay $1260/1250 = $16 per player. The total total cost of the team is $1200/1300 = $2 per player per year. Therefore the team has $2400 per year to spend on players.<n>Output - 30/300 = 3. If 30 times 3 is 60 then the total number of goals is 120. If the total number is 300 then all the goals scored against Barca would be 30. The team has 20% goals scored against Barca. 30/300 is 3/30 = 10%. Hence 60% (6 - 10%) = 15%. The team therefore plays a total of 300 games. There will be 32 different players on the team this season. Therefore there will be 120 goals scored against Barca each season

He finds a shop and selects olive oil and olive oil bottles. The shopkeeper then takes him to the bank and asks him for a receipt. As he looks at the bank-bought receipt, he notices that on the upper corner of the window glass, two red arrows point the same way. He realizes that both of those arrows point to an exit. He buys the red arrows marked ‘exit.’  He then goes home and reads the receipt carefully two or three times so that he can remember where it says to exit. He makes a diagram on the wall showing the exit and the arrows pointing to it. With his help, Doris can quickly make exit arrangements.   He is then asked to tell the bankkeeper that he is using red arrows to indicate the exit. He realizes that the exit number on the receipt is 9 and that the exit door signs on the wall are marked ‘exit’. With Doris’ help, John makes exit preparations.  Finally, John goes to the door. The exit signs are red. Doris is waiting for John there, so they walk through the red hallway to see the exit door. When they hit the red numbered door, Emilio sees a red arrow, so he looks at John’s receipt so that he will know his exit number. Doris then tells John about her demonstration, that exit sign, and the red arrows. They talk together and Doris explains how she used the red arrows to show where the exit is. John then says that he now has an exit prepared by red arrows.<n><n>Input: An engineer is in the lab when the machine they are testing is broken. He finds another machine to try to fix the first one.

Answer:    You learn that the English Alphabet and the Latin Alphabet have the same spelling systems but different spellings. You learn the difference between the letter F and the letter K. You learn that the English system of spelling is based on the Latin system of pronouncing. You learn that the alphabet of the Latin system includes the letter B, but not the letter P (a.k.a. the letter R). You learn that B has an “s” and not an “s.” You learn that letters are spelled with two vowels and one consonant. You learn that one vowel stands for “a” and one vowel stands for ”h,” which stands for ‘an.” You learn the letter “W” stands for “w.” You learn “L” is the middle letter in the word for “law.” You learn to spell words with “o” instead of “ay and “i.” You learn why you can’t spell “A” with a “o” sound, and why you can’ t spell “T” with a ‘o” sound. You learn that letters are not separate from each other in English. You learn that words are made up of three letters: the letter “a,” the letter “e,” and the letter “f.” You learn what “q” stands for and you learn what “t,” ’t,” and “i” stand for. You learn that consonants come before vowels in English and vowels come before consonants in English. You learn to spell the word for “b” with “b” and “b” isn�

When these women graduate, the median income for a wife and mother is $35,000 compared to $31,500 for a man.  Let's assume this is the median. What is the probability that this is going to be true?<n>Output: 0.2<n><n>Input:A couple is buying their daughter a new car. The father spends $19.50 on a credit card to buy it, while the mother spends $15.50.

The numbers range from 1,000 in 1995 to 12,000 in 2014.  It is clear that the higher the average age, the more marriages are being performed per year.  If the average age is 30,000 (the median, which is approximately 30,000) and the average age of a marriage is 50,000, the number of marriages per year becomes 21,000/50,000, for an average of 20,000 per year.   If the average age of marriage is 40,000 (which is the average, i.e. 29,000 - 40,000) then the above average should be 21,000/20,000  instead, it is 21,000/29,000, for an increase of 28.6 %.  This is very different from what happens with the median age.  The median marriage age grows from 27.3 and decreases as you get older than 30 years.  The following graph shows the trend in median marriage ages in the U.S.  If the graph is increasing, the trend in marriage ages is up, the trend in median marriage age is down, and the median marriage ages are close to each other. So, it would appear that marriage may be improving but it does not improve by 28.6 %, instead it is stable.<n>Input: Total marriage age<n>Output: Total Marriage Age 1,000 marriages per year<n>Output: Median Total Marriage Age 3,000 Per year<n>Output: Median total marriage age 3,000 per year<n><n>Input:An Italian couple has 10 children.

In this case, it will be "the number of goods sold (in a period) in this retail outlet (for a period of)..." As long as the total number of goods sold is exactly the number of goods purchased it should be the same. If the total number of goods purchased was less than the total number sold then one has to have only one product, which is a different word than "plural."

The engine makes 18,000 miles per year, so the engineer expects it to last until it is sold. There are 150,000 miles left on the 12-year warranty, plus 500,000 miles of operating mileage. The engine manufacturer expects that on average the engine gets 2,000 miles of additional life out of the engine based on normal operating wear and tear. If the mechanic tells him that the engine only needs 1,000 miles of additional oiling life, the owner can expect to pay $150.00 for the engine. The mechanic can be willing to charge the owner for the additional oiling because she can see that the engine is getting old. The mechanic can be unwilling to charge the owner for another 1,000 miles of oiling because she realizes the additional cost. The mechanic is the owner's friend. She can be told that the engine is already in bad condition. The mechanic can also be willing to tell the owner that his opinion on the cost of the engine can change in the future if the engine ends up requiring more repairs and upgrades. If the mechanic charges the owner more than $150 for the additional oiling, she can choose to take the engine back to the shop and return it to him for inspection or for her money back. If the mechanic charges her less than $150, she will not demand her money back.<n>Output: 5,250<n><n>Input: How is this question similar to the one asked in earlier section?

At the next stop sign, the driver sees that there are only two other lanes to go in. A left turn to go south is forbidden and also illegal because it causes too much traffic. However, it is not illegal to turn right to go south because there is no other way to go south before hitting the U-turn. The driver makes it onto the only lane before stopping in front of a construction zone to wait for the traffic stop to end. At the next U-turn, the driver decides to accelerate to the maximum speed and makes a U-turn to the north at the third stop sign. He then gets in the left lane to hit the next stop sign. He then speeds right through the third stop sign. Finally, he reaches the first traffic light and realizes that the traffic is moving too slow to safely pass.

Some names are already familiar; The Dark Tower is based on "The Dark Knight" by Christopher Nolan, The Hunger Games is based on "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins, and the Hunger Games: Catching Fire follows "Catching Fire" by Suzanne Collins. There are a few other authors who have also made movies based on their novels, but the majority that have had a movie made are either the Twilight series, the Harry Potter series (although Harry Potter was made in 3 parts) or the Twilight movies. These three series are popular, and the other ones are more popular as well, so it is understandable why they have had movies made.<n><n>The Hunger Games movies had mixed reviews among the general public, but still succeeded with the adults who read and watched the books. "Fifty Shades Darkr" came about after the success of the Hunger Games, and has already made a lot of money for the studios, so they are planning to continue the series and make a lot of money. The movie has received mixed reviews and low-quality reviews. The rating for the Hunger Games movies, and then the rating for "Darker", are a success in terms of gross revenue, but in terms of entertainment (including the movies), they do not hold up to the quality of other movies like "Star Wars".<n><n>The movie is not a popular series because it does not have much substance to it. The story is repetitive, and everything that happens in the first three movies, the first three acts of the novel also end up in the movie. The movie seems to be very simplistic, and it lacks the development that the book had. At the end of the book, the characters go into a new world that the movie makes seem like "Groundhog Day", where all of the events are the same, but it adds nothing to the books. Overall, if you were to read "Fifty Shades Dark" and not see "Fifty Shades Dark", the book would do nothing to advance the series, but if you're a fan of the series, then this movie is a decent rip-off.

Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n>Output:		 a<n><n>Output: If Adam has $1000 to invest and earns a dollar a day, John and Elijah have $500 to invest and earn a dollar a day. Therefore, the total amount Adam spends will be $1000 - $500 = $2000. However, John and Elijah won’t be able to spend that much money on each purchase.  In order to get a dollar a day from Adam, John and Elijah would need to buy a total of 12 goods and sell 10 goods. Using our example, they would need to sell 20 widgets in order to get $1000. If, instead, John and Elijah spent their entire investment and earned $1000, they would still be able to spend their entire investment and only earn $1000 on 10 goods. Therefore, they would only spend $1000 in total and take home $2000.  The difference is not made up for because the number of goods sold per year has been doubled, which means there were only 80 goods sold per year last year before the $500 investment and $2000 investment. However, there were 160 goods and workers in 2009 and 120 goods and workers in 2000. In order to take home $2000 twice as much this year because of the doubling the total number of goods sold will need to be at 40. In order to earn $2000 this year, John and Elijah would have to earn $1500 on 40 goods. If you want to avoid using these terms you will have to make further explanation in your answer.<n>Output: 1675<n><n>Input: Every hour John uses 2 1/2 pages of notes to write down equations and formulas.

But if B and D were tied, then the two Cs would not be tied, neither would the two A`s. So both A and B are tied. What is the outcome? B=CC<n>Output:A<n><n>Input:In this example, you get 3/4 times your money back once you have all your credits (1/4 of the loan paid). Once you have all your credits paid in full, the loan is only $6.50/month. In this example, you have a $10,000 loan. In order for you to not pay any interest, you would need to pay $30,000. (This is a loan with a variable interest rate; after you make the $6.50/year payment, your interest will rise from 3% to 9%. Also, you have to pay full principal because your loan can only be paid up to 90 days after the loan goes into the default category.) So with a $10,000 principal, you would still pay the same $300 in interest that you would have paid for the initial $10,000 with a $200 minimum payment. In this example, if your loan is paid on time, it is actually better to have an additional small loan to pay the $500 minimum payments. If you are paying on time, you actually have no money, you are just borrowing from yourself. In this example, it would seem that you could go without food, or use all the money you saved for other purposes and live. It is far more important to maintain your credit rating. You should have thought about this before you signed the loan. And you should have taken the loan out of a different account.

Finally he started to feel better and thought that he might not be sick after all but that his cough was not getting better. So they still treated his cough.

After paying $5.99 delivery and handling, he received two boxes. The remaining six boxes were purchased at Wal-Mart, but Dennis had already paid shipping for the Amazon order. He and his wife were planning on having another baby, but she fell ill recently. He did not want to replace one child's box, and he did not want to pay his $6.00 tax.  He left his wife on the phone, and he waited for his child to arrive from school. After the child was at work, Dennis drove to his son's house. Dennis told his wife that he wanted to replace all six condoms with three boxes of diapers. His wife did not object to the idea, so he left again and picked up three additional boxes at Wal-Mart. When Dennis went home, he found two boxes of diapers in the garage. Dennis had put more boxes of condoms in his freezer. The condoms were now frozen, which was in violation of the terms of the insurance.  Dennis did not want to refund the insurance company, since he did not have the money to do so.  Dennis was planning on selling the condoms at a garage sale. He did not want his family getting their hands on the condoms. Dennis said that the condoms would have never been purchased if he had known that his wife was pregnant while he was at work. After discussing the matter, his wife agreed that his reasoning was valid.  Dennis decided to sell the condoms. He asked his wife to not give him any problem about paying child support for his child, but she insisted that he should pay the original purchase price. He asked her to let him keep the cars.

Input: 1.3 b.c.:   5<n>Output: 5<n><n>Input: When David and I decided to get married, we decided that I would stay in the apartment. He would pay rent, however. We told our friends in the apartment building that we were expecting kids and that we wanted to make sure that none of them would be staying here. Our friends were very happy to see us.  David and I both worked full-time during that period of time, so we did not sleep in the same room. We both rented rooms in the building. As time passed, some of David's friends came out of the building and asked how they could help us with raising our kids. When we mentioned that we needed some money for our parents to care for the kids at certain times, David's friends offered to pay for these occasional costs. One of his friends even gave us a free bike. My friends often invited us out and to movies, restaurants, festivals, and parks so that we could see their babies. I still remember the first time we went to a park with two little girls, we walked around in the park for hours and enjoyed the outdoors with our kids. The children of the people who lived in the building often threw birthday parties for us. One birthday party brought a whole bunch of cookies, so we were able to get extra calories from that. I also remember how one day some of the kids threw me a bike. The bike was nice, but I do not remember if it was free or paid for. Over the years my apartment has become less and less of a place of family fun. Some of these friends have moved. A few friends still live in the building, but due to the baby issue, most are single and never have the chance to be out and about with their children. I feel sad for all the kids because my favorite ones are the young ones that still come over and play with me or take me on a bike ride. I hope that someday our kids will feel the same way towards us.<n>Input: 0

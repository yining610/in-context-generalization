Answer: Total Oil Spill Company.  They average 3,500 gallons per week but are required to have a total of 25 different type of engines.  The engine they have has 6 blower engines so they have to have 6 blower engines in addition to the 6 type of engines which means they have at least 13 different blowers and all of these 13 different blowers are made with different brands. So in order to fill up a tank of their oil (3,500 gallons) they must have 13 different brands of engines on their entire assembly line.  Since their oil contains 10 different types of lubricants.\nWhich means, Total Oil Spill Company has 3,500 gallons of 10 different types of lubricant on their production line.  Therefore 3,500 gallons = 3000 gallons of 10 different types lubricants.\nTotal Oil Spill Company has their oil on their production line at least twice a day because, if they do not have the correct type of lubricant on their line, the lubricant will seep through and stain their equipment. So they must have at least 6 different types of equipment and, in order to have 27 different blowers, their production line must have at least 12 different types of engines.\nWhich means the total amount of lubricant being used by Total Oil Spill Company is at least 3,500 gallons.

Input:  If a paper is folded at one axis, at least one component of the paper is of length more than the paper if folded at another axis, at least one of them is a little shorter than the paper if folded in a different axis than the paper being folded at the other axis. Output:  If a paper folded at one axis is perpendicular to its axis, the paper is parallel to its axis and would have no more than two dimensions; similarly, if a paper is parallel to its two axis, at least one or both of them is longer than the paper if folded only at one axis; if a paper is parallel but not perpendicular to its axis, at least one part of the paper has a little longer component than its axis; and thus, at least one of the paper is of greater length than if that part were parallel to its axis.\nInput:  Suppose a sheet of paper has 8 dimensions, then its length is equal to its width minus its height.  Given 2 parallel sheets having the same length and width, the longer dimensions (1 and 2) of one sheet measure one and one-half times as long as the corresponding dimensions (1 and 2), then the shorter dimensions (3 and 4) of the other sheet measure one-third as long as the corresponding dimension(s), so in this particular case a sheet of paper having four dimensions is equal to a sheet of paper having 8 or more dimensions. When a paper is parallel to itself, it is perpendicular to half of 8 or 5 or 3, and thus is not parallel to the other half of 8 or 5.\nInput:\na.A sheet of paper having 8 dimensions is equal to a paper with eight dimensions if the paper is folded along the same dimension.\nb.If a sheet of paper is not parallel to itself, then it has no less than four dimensions.\nc.If a paper is parallel but perpendicular to itself, then its total dimension is 16 or 6 times as many dimensions, as the dimension along its axis\nd.If a paper is not parallel to its axis, it has two dimensions.\ne.If a paper is perpendicular to its own axis, then its total dimension can be expressed as being equal to its cross-sectional area in the plane perpendicular to its own axis + 1.05 x", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

A: opera The opera is very important because people will not have access to food unless they attend or order food online through the opera\nThis will create demand for food, but it may not create enough demand to get most of the people in the opera to find food.\nThe supermarket or supermarket/hypermarket will have the greatest amount of success in making people eat out, and will need an incentive to create demand.

He is concerned that he may be able to get additional financing for the new addition if he rents out his existing home to a neighbor at a price of $200.00 per month, plus a 2% commission to him.  He is trying to decide if this is a good deal given the amount of work involved and the high value of the addition.  He also believes that when a neighbor rents the new addition out the price should be reduced due to an increase in market value since the house is being used to rent out the newly built addition.    The owner\u2019s new addition measures a mere 16 feet x 30 feet and his existing home measures 22 feet x 35 feet.  Can you tell him whether or not renting the house out does a fair deal or if he should go ahead with the build?\nOutput: The buyer of the new addition will get a 2% commission as an advance for the cost of the initial home construction.  However, the house will cost $500.00 but will be the property of the buyer for the life of the mortgage.  After 1 year there will be a one-time increase of 50 cents per month.  The total cost of the build/rental transaction will be $250,000 at an estimate of 17% annual interest payments on 5 year loans.  At the end of the build/rent period the total cost of the buy/lease transaction will be $750,000.00.  An increase of $250,000.00 does not equate to $750,000.  The total cost for a new addition to the existing house is $625,000.00.\nOutput: The cost of buying the new addition is $625,000, the cost of building the addtion is $375,000 and the average price the addtion is rented for is $200.00.  Therefore the new addition will probably be the home only of one user, and that owner will make a good deal on this build/rent transaction.\n\nInput: How many acres does a football field occupy when measured in square feet?

{"text": "Where could a printer be used?\nInput:A paper recycling center in Europe is a place for companies, individuals and governments to recycle large numbers of paper sheets at one location and at a discounted rate per sheet.  The idea is to be able to reduce or recycle large quantities of paper and create an economic system for reuse.  The goal is to divert high-quality sheets from landfills and reduce trash generated in the recycling industry. What do you think should be done to help develop a recycling service in a region where large population density and few recycle centers are available?\nOutput:In many parts of the world, the need for recycling paper is high. There are large markets for the recycling of paper, which means there can be large volumes of paper processed, requiring thousands of employees. The main goal of recycling is to divert waste from landfills and increase economic opportunities for individuals in the recycling industry. One way to provide job opportunities to individuals is through a local paper recycling company.  A paper recycling program would give paper recyclers the resources and incentive needed to help increase the processing volume in the local region.    What are the potential effects of a paper recycling program in the USA?\nOutput:  A paper recycling program could help reduce both costs and waste. For example, each individual will save money on paper costs when less paper is required for their projects.  For companies, they find that paper recycling programs are cost-effective as they save time and reduce the number of employees involved in handling the paper.\nInput:In response to the statement\n\u201cPaper and cardboard contain much high quality material that can be used as sources of energy or raw materials.\u201d   How could a program that would create an economic incentive for paper recycling reduce the amount of energy required to recycle?\nOutput: As a result of the recycling process paper, which takes energy, is transformed into a useful product. Paper can be converted from one application to another and reused.  Thus, recycling programs increase economic opportunities for industry and individuals. For example, paper is a viable raw material that can be used to manufacture a variety of products, such as paper and plastic.\nInput: The paper and cardboard industry in Europe is an economic force to be reckoned with. Paper has become one of the most important raw materials in the world, and paper manufacturing facilities have multiplied in the regions where this industry is developed.  According to Eurostat, Europe has an estimated 7-8 million tonne paper industry employing 7-8.", "answer": "A: school"}

{"text": "County Lines are Lines on Earth, County Highway are Lines in the Field. Each Country/State line has one or more County highways in addition to the one or more County towns/cities shown on the map.  They are also called States/Counties because these are different levels of Government (Government, County, Township, County Park District/School District, Township Highway District, School District/Township).  Therefore the Highway and County lines are different.  As a result, there are many different definitions for each.  So be careful interpreting the road signs.  As stated in the Highway Department\u2019s website,\n\u201cA highway is a road traveled over by public and owned vehicles. A county is any part of a state or territory which has the power to make laws for public roads, but which is exempt from the jurisdiction of the State or Territory.  A State Highway is generally the same as a county highway; see State Highway.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration defines the word road:\n\u201cRoad means the entire network of wayside structures connected by highways (both state and federal). From a highway stand point, road is a means by which a person may travel from one place to another.\u201d\nA highway is actually the roads, state and federal highways.  A county and highway are two different meanings.  As stated above, each State Highway and State town Road is different and thus each County Highway is different and so are the County Highway/Township Roads that link those County Highway/Township Road\u2019s.\nTo use your County Highway and Township Highway as a county road means that it is a State Highway.  To connect a Highway and County Highway can mean that it has the power to lay rails, cut corners, widen and fix roads, pave roadways, etc.  Therefore, the County Highway is also called a State Highway.  A county or highway with the power to lay tracks, etc., is called a City Highway.  In Michigan, there were 17 cities and 10 towns and counties.  So when you look at the county highways, you might also notice that there may be more than one county highway with the power to build the roadways and perform other tasks that are not city and town highways.\n\nThe definition of a county line has several definitions; however, generally the definition is in the U.S. Code section entitled \u201cThe Interstate and Defense Highway System\u201d which provides two definitions,\nThe first one states that", "answer": "B: map"}

{"text": "All of them.  All of the above.  The best place to buy moistener is on the toilet\n\nInput: A farmer sells his crops to a grain merchant who then sells them to a local market where a retailer then provides the consumer with the items in a convenient location based upon consumer preferences.  The consumer is given a \u201dcard\u2019 which may contain the items of interest.  From here on, the producer takes care of the end user.  The consumer may now choose where to buy items like detergents, flushing products and toilet paper.  The retailer provides the product and may be the provider of the \u201ccard\u201d to the consumer.  Once the consumer completes the transaction, he may have more items in that bag, or maybe some items he was never able to buy.  If this is true of the first transaction, it will likely be true of subsequent purchases.  The second transaction will likely use the same model.  The end user may find that he \u2018loses\u2019 some products in the transaction.  If he likes the first transaction, this will not be a problem, but if he likes the second transaction, he will either want them back, or at least be pleased to find that they were in the transaction in the first place.  The second transaction can be done at other retailers and with merchants.  Or it can be done privately between the consumer and the retailer.  Or it can even be done between the consumers and the merchant.\nOutput: The product must then be put back into the bag.\nThus, if the product has been in the bag, the payment must be placed back into the bag.

Since most people want to drink the beverage which is being raised; they must be partaking in the toast and therefore the toast being made by is a person partaking in the beverage. So most people are partaking in a toast.  This could then lead to a few people having several drinks at the same time.  Because this is not a simple drinking game; you need many people to participate to have fun.  This is one or many people taking a drink at the same time if the person partaking in the toast can keep from getting drunk; they are partaking in a drink.\nOutput: Everybody raised a glass of wine, drank while the toast was being made and cheered.  Most people have the ability to keep from getting drunk from the alcohol they drink; this could be partaking in the drink or it could be someone else drinking the drink; since most people get drunk, it would be partaking in a drink or it could be a toast.\nOutput: There were two groups, one group had a toast and the other group did not.  Everyone cheered; there were two people being partaking in a toast (one of which is the person who raised the glass); they are both being partaking in the toast (as most people get drunk).  Most people raised a drink; they were partaking in the toast or another person was raising another glass of wine.\nOutput: A group of people were doing a drink, people were cheering; there were several people being partaking; they were all partaking in a drink but some people got drunk (thus a toast) and some people didn\u2019t.\nOutput: Most people were raising drinks while the toast was being raised; they were being partaking or the toast was being made.\nOutput: The toast was being done by a person who was partaking in a drink; thus they are partaking in the toast with alcohol in it.\nOutput: A person who drinks a drink with alcohol in it is partaking in a drink with alcohol.\nOutput: An individual raising a drink is a person partaking.\nOutput: Many people drank while the toast was raised.\nOutput: There was a toast done", "answer": "E: celebrating"}

Mileage plus tolls would come out to $3.50.\nThe cost of one trip is $3.50. 2 trips is $6.50 and 3 trips is $21.50.\nIf this was a trucking company, the price per mile that they charge for their truck would be $3.50.  If it was a travel agency they would charge $2.50.\nBut it\u2019s not a trucking company.  It\u2019s a car rental.

He needs to charge it when he takes the car on his first full charge or when he gets to the end of the 14 day rental contract. He\u2019ll charge it at the end of the 2nd full day of his rental, when he takes the car home and that\u2019ll be the 3rd full charge.  He\u2019ll need to charge it at the end when he gets home after a 24 hour break.

On average he has 4 horses available at any time for $400.00 per horse.  He would like to rent the horses for 3 months at a cost of $400.00 for each horse.  However, the number of horses at any given time and the condition of the horses will likely change.  Therefore, he needs the opportunity to negotiate with the horse supplier as to the rate to the end of the 3 months.  If he gives the horse supplier a fixed price at the beginning of the 3 months (and negotiates an increase to an average price at the end of the 3months) what is the price he will pay the horse supplier if the average price at the end is better than the price he gave at the beginning?\nOutput: He will pay his horse supplier the sum of $400.00 (42*4=<<42*4=210>>210)\n\nInput:Jason asks you to rent his car for $30.00 per day.  The cost of a rental is $160.00 a day.  The total cost is $800 per month.  When you take into account the cost of gas you will see how much he spends.  If you had to get a loan to cover the cost of the rental then he has $650 a month.  When you subtract your monthly cost to keep the rental it gives you $530 a month.  What does a $600 a month save you over a six month period?\nOutput: If you take a $600 a month charge for the rental you would have $260.00 extra each month.\nTaking the minimum amount of $60 per month would still only bring him $265, leaving him $215 less a month than the $600 a month charge with the same level of expenses.\n\nInput:John is renting a car for 14 days, and plans to travel to Oregon to buy a house.

To calculate this number, use this formula\n\nInput: The average annual growth of the U.S. Agriculture Department, since the Great Depression. To find this using this formula, subtract the number of years since 1929 from 1950. Thus, 1950 = 3 x 1929 = 6. Now subtract the number of years between 1938 and 1944 from 1950. Thus, 1945 = 4 x 1938 = 12. So, 12 x 1939 = 20. So, 1930 = 15. Now divide the numbers between 1939 and 1944 by the number of years between 1937 and 1944 (since the beginning of the 40s). Thus, 1940 = 3.4 x 1938 = 9. So, 1939 = 6.4 + 9 = 15.\nTherefore, 1960 = 29 x 1937 + 9 = 40\nTherefore, 1980 = 36.4 x 1937 + 9 = 58\n\nInput: A truck drives from A to B on a road running parallel to a river.

She sells her products to a furniture distributor that buys these products wholesale and sells them to a larger furniture manufacturer that buys them again, and this cycle repeats itself over and over.  Her monthly expenses are $1000.00.  A car is available in her lot for the sole purpose of leasing it out.  She asks you, with a smile on her face, to be the first person to lease it out.  You accept the offer and agree to pay her $750.00 per year for the remaining 8 years of your term.  The price should be $0 because the car should last 8 years, but it should be $750.00 because of interest costs.

Jim was in charge.  Jim had a map and a compass.  Jim estimated that the trip took two hours.  Jim estimated that each person used the compass in three of the four directions.

At the gate of the airport, a baggage attendant informs the pilots that the airplane would only be able to carry 50 pounds of baggage with them due to a \"luggage policy.\" The pilots, who are accustomed to carrying 400 pounds of luggage in their personal aircraft, react strongly, as they would not have the privilege of returning to the airport in their airline aircraft to make further purchases. Instead, the pilots agree to pay the attendant an extra fee for the extra amount of luggage they will not be able to take back to their airline aircraft. The pilots have to decide if this will benefit them personally or their company.\n\nOutput:The pilots decide to pay $20.00 on each extra piece of luggage. But will that be enough to offset the weight in total? Weighing 5,000 pounds, the extra luggage will require 5,000 pounds of additional weight.\nIn total, that is 10,000 pounds of additional luggage for the 7 passengers and their attendant.\nEach extra piece of luggage will cost the passengers $20.00. They have to decide if paying $20.00 is the best decision they can make for them in this situation. If it benefits them personally, they will pay the extra $20.00. But they must decide if it is the best decision for the company. If the extra expense outweighs the benefits the company will save in fuel and time it would take to get to the next airport, then the company will make less money and will not be able to fly as much because they had to wait for the 7 passengers to return.

How many of each of these will you need $70,000 to qualify for and are you asking someone who can\u2019t access it to borrow more money?  In other words, what type of investor does she need $70k to participate in the program with?\nOutput: the program requires $70,000 in the bank account (in addition to an investment account).  Thus, each required individual will need $70,000 in cash ($10, 000 per person depending on their age) so that they can have a bank/investment account with the new service and thus be eligible for the program.\nAssuming that no other requirements are met, then one person can buy $70,000 worth of goods or services each month and receive $10,000 in bonus payments from the bank for that month.\nSince each individual will need $70k in cash (and not $50k) to participate in the program, each individual will need $50,000 worth of deposits each month in order to receive the bonus payments\nThus, if each individual takes $10,000 from their investment account at the end of each month and deposits it in their account, then each individual will need $15,000 per bank account ($2,000 per month minimum) to receive the bonuses.\nThus, the maximum monthly income from the program is $15,000 per person.\nSince each month the bank will distribute $10,000 in bonuses ($3,000 each) to over 20,000 potential investors, then this means that the maximum monthly income from this program is $15, 000 per month.\nThus, the final answer is 20\n\nInput:A new game has no end but each player only has a limited number of moves left during the allotted \u201cturn\u201d.

Their share of the land is 30 acres per farmer.   One farmer puts water on one side of his corn and on the other side, a neighbor puts water on the other side of his corn.  Since their fields are approximately two thirds in and one third out of the way of each other, what is the acreage that one of them will be watering for the entire 90 days?\nOutput: 30*30=<<30*30=240 >>240\n\nInput:A farmer and a gardener are putting crops into their respective barns for the winter, and the farmer\u2019s barns are full, so while the gardener has been putting in his crops into his garage, he has not finished putting in his crops into all of his barns.

However, the farmer\u2019s crop has not been put into his other barn yet.  So the farmer will have the same amount of extra crops in his barn he already started putting in.\nThus, the farmer\u2019 crop will only be put into the barns he is not using.

What is the best way to transport the apples to a town about 50 miles from the fair?\nOutput: The best way is to have a truck that is large enough to empty all the load onto one side of the road and unload onto the other.\n\nIf the apples are to be stacked on top of each other they must be on top of two piles of trees for them to be stacked.  Also, as they are thrown one at a time into the barrel they must be dropped by hand, so that the barrels are empty for the next load.  The barrels must then be re-stocked; the process requires time.  The total time required to transport 1000 lbs. of apples to a town 150 miles from the fair is 2*9=120 hours.  Thus, 40 days in the barrel are spent transporting 1000 lbs. and 20 days on the way there are 80 days in the barrel.  The total time from start to finish is 120*80=360 hours.

{"text": "airport has no security\nA university is known to accept foreign students and it has received criticism for failing to notify foreign students of visa requirements ahead of time.  University policy says that students must have a passport and a letter of invitation as proof of a valid visa to enter the U.S. so university officials have stated that it is responsible for the visa of all foreign students.  Given the university\u2019s reputation for low security, what is the likelihood that the student who rented the apartment of a potential attacker will take these safety precautions seriously?\nOutput: There is no airport security at all because the airport operates as a private business and the owner decides what security precautions are necessary.\nConcerts have had concerns that unruly performers and intoxicated patrons could attack the performers and guests at the event.  The venue\u2019s security measures involve hiring additional security services and putting an extra layer of guards to patrol the venue.  This has caused concerns among concert attendees for security.  While there are some concerns about the extra cost, it also could mean better security for the concert.\nHome security features include a burglar alarm and police reports.\nAirport security features include a high level of security, including armed security officers or agents.  Other security features include a metal detector checkpoint to control access to the secure area.  While these security measures may be effective, the problem of security that would be associated with any one of these security features may be sufficient to deter the attacker.\nTerminal security features include a baggage claim area that is patrolled by TSA officers.  Also, the boarding process includes a metal detector to ensure that checked bags are not carrying valuables.  These measures are effective.\nInput: What have all the security measures that airports have provided?  (1) The response of a group of thieves is predictable.  Deterrence is the key feature of these security measures.  How can they be effective to deter a group of thieves? If a group of thieves steals from an airport in Los Angeles, even if the thief is apprehended, the group will often break through security and steal a lot more things.  Deterrence is therefore the key feature of airports.  (2) If the thief is apprehended, airports are willing to take a loss.  Therefore an airport\u2019s security staff will be happy when the thief is apprehended.  That was one of the requirements of the airport security program in Los Angeles.  How is this strategy effective?  (3) It may be impossible to", "answer": "E: airport"}

The team has to try to find the body of a dead scientist and the rest of the team has to go on their own search for the body. There are so many unexploded bombs and there is no way to get them all out. One of the researchers goes to an old storage room that has been abandoned since the war and finds a huge tank full of oil. The researcher opens the door to it and the oil runs out. They put the oil in a big tank and get the rest stored. The team heads out again and they find about half a million more barrels. The team has to work really fast and figure out a way to get the oil out of the tank as it is going to run out soon. They find that they need to go through an old tunnel and into an old mine for the oil to run out. It becomes really hot in there and takes a long time to get out the oil. Eventually, the oil runs out as well. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms sends another team of investigators. These people are really good at explosives. They try different ways to get more oil from the original oil well and they discover that they can drive the oil out of the old mines with dynamite.\nInput: The government wants people to rent a car, buy a cheap, basic gasoline (or diesel, whatever gas there is in the US), and drive as much distance as they can.

{"text": "fridge\nSo the final answer\n\nInput: There is a man who has $1000.00 and wants to buy some gold coin.  You can:  1: Get one of 20 gold coins for $50.00.  2: Buy one of 30 gold coins for $125.00.  3: Pay $50 for each coin at face amount.  4: Buy one of 50 gold coins for $20. and 5: Buy 10 gold coins for 15.  At face value, how much does that buy you?\nOutput: $1000 at face value\nYou need $1000 to buy 10 coins\u2026 so at face value buying the one for $50 and the 10 for $15 costs you $500.00\nSo that\u2019s $750\u2026. so you have $250.00\nSo buy the coin for $50 and the coin for $125..  You have $750 cash\u2026.\nSo total coin cost is $250.00\nOutput: $1000\n\nInput: If there are 3 rooms with 2 beds in the price range of $50 a night, the third room has double the value of the 2 beds rooms.  If there are 5 rooms and 4 have two beds, each bedroom could be worth $50.00 each, so all of the bedrooms are worth $150.00 each.  How many nights a month is there in a quarter in the price range?  Output: 3 nights\nThe total number of nights in a room that has 2 beds is 12 (3 beds)  So the total number of nights in the room that has 2 beds and has double the value of any single room is 27, for a total cost of $1000.00.  So your night\u2019s per quarter is equal to $150 or $600, for a total of $750.00\nSo the total coin cost is $750 or $600, for $750.00.\n\nInput: There are 80 children attending a private school in a big city.

The temperature was 55 degrees and relative humidity was 25%.  The wind created wind gusts of 33 mph that blew north of you at 15 miles in a direction directly across your face on a flat field.\nOut of a field the wind speed and direction were 10 and 15 miles per hour.  The difference between these two wind velocities is 33 mph, or a 3.00 m/s squared.  On a flat flat field the speed of the wind will depend on the relative motion of surface to air and distance from the ground.  The relative motion of a flat floor or the ground to the horizontal is approximately 3.00 m/sec squared (8 times 12).\nOut in the field the relative motion of an air mass is approximately 1.00 m/sec2 (4 times 14) so in theory, the wind speed and direction are 3.00+1.00+1.0+1.0 = 6.00 m/sec with a wind perpendicular to the ground.\nTherefore, in the above situation, the actual wind speed and direction is 1.00 m/s3 so in theory, the actual wind speed, or force, is 1.00 m3.  Therefore, the above wind speed, or magnitude, is 1.00*10=30 mph.\nIf the wind were blowing at 20 m/s that would cause a force of 15 m/s squared but on your flat field the relative motion of the air mass is 12.00 m/sec so the force is actually 13 m3.", "answer": "A: exhilaration"}

He is running late and decides to take an airplane to a different airport without the airplane crew.  What should his course be?\nOutput: He should be landing the airplane safely on the first attempt.  He must not make a second attempt but be landing on the first attempt.\n\nInput: An engine loses power after just 150 miles of being in use.  The pilot decides he wants to return home to refuel and then try again.  If he returns home on one of these attempts, which one?\nOutput: The pilot was already running on one engine and would need to take a second attempt.\nAn attempt would cost more gasoline and thus have an affect to the price of gasoline.  Thus, the second attempt would be a loss in the first attempt.\nThe second attempt would also take longer to refuel the airplane compared to the first attempt.\nThus, the second attempt would result in a second loss in the first try.\nSo his second try would result in a second failure in the first try. Therefore the second attempt would be an unsuccessful attempt.\nThus his second turn would result in a second failed attempt. There would be one round about he could fail a second time but that is unlikely. Thus, the round about would yield a second loss in the second failed attempt.\nSo his second attempt would result in an unsuccessful attempt.\n\nInput and Output:\nTiny Tim wants to go to Disney World.

Which one will also be paying the toll in Australia?\nOutput:You have $14.00 to pay for tolls in Australia\nSo your total tolls for the two persons will be $14.00/$14.00=$18.00\nTherefore $18.00 is the total tolls for the train\nSo the final answer for the 2 person trip is $12.00\n\nInput:Suppose that you have a room at a hotel, and pay $65.00 per night for it.  Let\u2019s assume that next night you pay for the same room again.  For the next 5 nights you each make 2 separate payments of $65.00 each. What is the total night\u2019s cost?\nOutput:For the next 5 nights at the hotel, you will pay $50.00 each\nTotal: $65.50 plus $65.00\nSo your total monthly cost is $105.50 plus $105.50/5 = $105.50\nTherefore if you have $140.00 in your bank at the end of the month then $105.50 x 10 x 5 = $140.00\nBecause your balance is $140.00/105.50 = $140.00, the total cost is $140.00\nAnd, because of your previous payment, you now have $100.00 ($100.00 x 10 x 5 = 120).  Let\u2019s apply a new payment of $75.00 because of that.  Therefore your total monthly cost will be $105.50\n\nInput:The weather station records a temperature of 58 degrees fahrenheit at 4:00 PM.

They then have to clean out the box for wood, sand and shine, making the wood shiny.  The next step for the roofer is to lay the tiling, the first 3 layers are typically ceramic or laminate tiles.  The tile is laid in a square pattern, and the tile setters use a scraper to clear any loose material out from the tiles before placing the tiles down. Once the tiles are placed on the floor, they need to be smoothed, to ensure smooth application.  The tiles must now be sanded, so the rough pieces can be removed without scratching the tiles.  The roofers finish by trimming excess dirt which is common to avoid leaving any small cuts on the tiles. Each day during their roofing job the roofers move a bit of the rough to allow for smooth application.\n\nInput:During their roofing service, a roofer must move the debris out of the hole so that they can clean it and reuse the same hole later.  To clean the debris from the hole, the roofer takes a hand held device, which resembles a chisel, and rubs around the hole cutting up the debris.  To make sure the debris can be reused, they must allow the debris to dry for several days before being reused.  Since there is no way for them to make sure that the debris dries in time, they must sand the roof for a few days prior to using it again.  This sanding results in very rough tiles which have to be sanded before being reused.\n\nInput:A man was working at the factory when his boss told him he could come to the office at night to work on an urgent job.

Price is decided on which shoe you will use most. Price is determined so that shoes at one price will always be the best because they are more likely to be used than the shoes at a lower price.  What is the total pair of shoes it costs to purchase 6 pairs?\nOutput: The total cost is $150.00+ =<<150+12>>12.\n6 pairs of shoes total $150.00 and thus, 6*6=<<150+12>>6 pairs are purchased.\nEach pair of shoes will be used 6*6=<<<6+12>>6 pairs of times for $150.00.\nThus, 6*6=<150+12>>6 shoes total $150.\nSince each pair of shoes is purchased six times at $150.00, 6*6=$150+($$$50)/6 = $150+$150-$150-150, therefore 6*6=$0\nThus, 6*10 = <<<10+1200>>10 pairs are purchased\nEach pair of shoes is 2*2=<<<10*2>10 times for $2.00\nThus, 2*2=<<10*2>2 pairs of shoes are purchased.\n\nOutput: Let\u2019s take the number of pairs of shoes and divide it by the number of days the person will be staying at the house. Therefore, 6 shoes for 20 days is:\n*60/20 = <<60/20>40 shoes\nThe total number of shoes for 20 days is (60/20) + (2*8)^40 = 40 shoes\nThus, 60/20=<<(2*80)*40>>40 shoes\nThus, 60*20=50 shoes\nSince each $2 pair of shoes is only used twice, the total of the shoes purchased for this single night has been $150.\nThus, 50*20 = $150\nTotal of shoes purchased for this night have been $150\nThus, $150-$150=$150-$50\n10 pairs of shoes = $180\nThus, $180-$180=$180-$40\n20 pairs of shoes = $240\nThus, $240-$240=160\n6 pairs of shoes = $350\nThus, $350-$350=<<60", "answer": "D: headache"}

The company says for free usage if he pays their annual service fee of $750.  The annual fee is on top of his credit card.  How do the numbers add up?\nOutput: The annual fee is $2,000 and $750 is $75=<<75+75=110>>110 total.  So $750 pays for the annual fee and $750 is left over to pay for utilities and his credit card.

{"text": "The preferred solution of keeping a book in a closet is the most likely.\n\nInput:Two planes are going over each other.   The smaller plane has 4 seats and the other plane has a lot of cargo for storage.  The smaller plane carries a cargo of food and the larger plane carries a cargo of medicine.  Both planes will use their left engines to help lift the cargo.  The smaller plane will fly to London, and the larger plane will fly to Sydney.  It takes 45 minutes to fly from Sydney to London, leaving a full fifteen minutes before the smaller plane arrives.  It takes 40 minutes to fly from London to Sydney, leaving a full twenty minutes before the larger plane arrives.  Based on their experience with the smaller airplane the smaller plane will take longer to get to land than the larger plane.   They estimated the distance to be equal to 3600 miles.  Based on their experiences with the larger airplane they estimated the distance to be equivalent to 4400 miles. Therefore, each airplane will take twice as long to land as the smaller plane.   They assumed that they could take advantage of the right engine to make up for their differences in endurance.  They estimated that if they had to take the time they have now the distance the small plane would take them would be 2200 miles.  If they were to fly at their normal speed the time would be about the same.\n\n1. Which statement best describes your situation?\n2. Which statement best describes the difference between planes?\n3.

In this case how do you consider speed to be related to distance?\n5. In this case the size of the plane matters a lot, but at what altitude is speed related to distance?\n6. In this case the right engine would make the difference between being able to land and not being able to land.\n7. In this case it might be a good idea to have passengers in the larger plane.

What is the total monthly charge for a car that can go from coast to coast, at the average speed of 40 miles per hour?\nOutput: $160.00\nSince 10 days is 14 days, the additional 1 day is 1*14 =<<1*14=10>>10.\nTotal for the extra day will be 1*10=<<10*10=20>>20\nThus the total for the extra day is 20*20=<<20*20=50>>50.00\nSo the total for the extra 1 day is 50*20=<<50*20=120>>120.00\nThe total for the extra 1 week is 120*120=<<120*120=430>>430.00\nSo the additional 3 weeks worth is 4*120=<<4*120=240>>240.00\nSo the extra 3 years worth is 6*120=<<6*120=360>>360.00\nSo the increased number of years of car rental is 4*120*180*360.00\nSo you now have 6 years of car rental for $360.00\n\nInput: A cow is standing in the field, and a bale of hay is being cut for it to be delivered to her shelter home. If the bale is cut with the use of a mechanical scissorman, then what would the total weight be?\nOutput: She should be able to pull a bale of 30 pounds, but it is possible that she might only pull a bale that is 25 pounds and should calculate her cost and ask for a specific discount since she is using a mechanical scissorman.\nThus the total for a full 30 pound bale of hay will be 20*30*30=<<20*30=90>>90.00\nThe total will be <30*90*90=<<30*180=160>>60.00\nThus the total for 2 20% weight bales will become 60*60*60=960.00\nSo a full bale of hay will become 960*180*180.00\nThus the extra cost will be 1*960*180*180.\nThe total for 2 full bales will become =1*980*180*180.01\nThus the", "answer": "A: desire"}

It will cost $500.00 and it needs to be done soon.  You have 4 days and 7 hours to start working on it.  You need to work 6 days (the first 4 are days off work) with 1 8 hour day and 5 days working 3 hours.  Which 4 days will you work?\nOutput: You will finish the roof in the next 3 days.  It takes you 5 days to complete the job, so you will work 6 days in a row.  4 days of work will make the total amount of hours worked in 5 days, 7 hours.  Each 8 hour day will only work for 2 8 hour days which will make the total hours worked 5 days, 8 hours.  Thus, you will need 5 8 hour days.\nThus, 3 8 hour days work out to 20 hours in a week.\nThus, 10+2=<<10+2=42>>42 hours of work per week.\nSo, 20 hours of work (30+60+48+5+6+48 = 100) in a week works out to an average for 50 minutes per hour.\nSo, 10+2=>>43 minutes per hour.\nAnd 10+3=<<43 minutes per hour.<<43 minutes per hour works out to 20 minutes per hour.<<20 minutes per hour works out as 23-25 minutes per hour.\nThus, 3+2=26 minutes per hour.\n\nInput: I have a horse named \"Spike\".

It has 5 planes that it owns and an additional 10 aircraft it has rented out (for a total of 15 aircraft).  The aircraft in question is an Airbus.  The airplane is used for corporate trips.  The plane is owned by the company and rented out as a vacation spot.  The plane is rented for 5-days.  There is a cost to renting an aircraft (the cost is the same as the rental cost) but there are also other expenses included in the cost of renting the aircraft ($50.00 per hour) - i.e., fuel $150.00 per hour, insurance $400.00 per hour.\nOutput: The total cost of renting the aircraft is 6 $400.00\nThus, total cost of renting the planes is 6*100 = $400.00\nIf the rent was $100.00/day = $150.00/day, then the total cost of renting the airplanes is $150.00*5 = $600.00\nThus, the only difference between the average cost of renting one plane and the average cost of renting ten planes is $10/day.\nSo the final result is 6*10 = $1200.00\nNow if you want to look at something from a different perspective, consider what the total cost of a vacation is compared to the average weekly pay for an airline pilot. Then, the cost of renting an airplane for the vacation will actually be less expensive than the cost of an airline pilot (since an airplane is more like a rental than a paycheck). Thus, if you think about it, you can see that one-way airplane flights and vacations actually make a lot more sense financially than flying across the continent for work and back again.\n\nInput:A guy goes to his favorite casino in Vegas, NV to buy $6.00 worth of chips.

In Chicago, the temperature is 102, so how many degrees above that is it?\nOutput: The temperature in Chicago is 102, and it will be 103 in the shade. So as shown the weather in Chicago is hotter and Humidex is lower, so it\u2019s 102+heat+humidities = 97.\nIt\u2019s hotter and Humidex = 97, but it will be 102+heat+humidity = 103-82\nSo the final answer for Chicago is 102+heat+humidex = 97. (The error is actually greater than the error of -3, since the heat/humidity formula is -3/102)*2=2^2*2.\nThus, there is a 3-degrees error (3*101) and thus a final answer of 98.

So the total of cost per year is 1/1000, which is $80,000.\nThus a 1500 acre horse farm will cost him $20,000 in maintenance and other fees and taxes.

The question is how do you determine the \u201cminimum need\u201d for such a force?\nOutput: For a military offensive capability, it is not the number of fighter jets or helicopters that is relevant but their role. An offensive capability can be defined by distinguishing the role from a deterrent. Deterring by a strong ability to deny access to the other, is the role that fighter aircraft are needed for and deterring by the use of nuclear weapons is not needed. While nuclear weapons are used as a deterrence, an offensive capability can be a countermeasure in the event of the loss of a state's military supremacy. These factors give rise to the term \u201cminimum need,\u201d but it is not to be confused with the concept of \u201cminimum requirements.\u201d\nFor any military offensive capability, it will always be necessary to have forces larger than the number required to guarantee that no external state can deny access to the other\n\nInput:The number of people who are unable to remember their birthdays on the date of the year they were born.

It must be a state that has better water for animals than another state.  The person who wrote this question was not aware of any state in which animals have the right to water.  They thought of the following states: Oklahoma, Missouri, West Virginia, Arkansas and, of course, California (though the rights of other types of animals aren\u2019t discussed).\nOutput:An answer from the state of Oklahoma or west Texas is wrong.\nWhich state would be the best choice, in the opinion of the writer?\n\nInput: A group of men (three brothers) want to travel to New Haven, Connecticut.  They are going to drive a car to Connecticut and spend most of the week sleeping somewhere in New Haven while they are looking for work.  To do this they need money.  The brother with the most money wants to drive up to the state line and drive the rest of the way to New Haven.  He can afford the $200 needed to get up there, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to do that because the gas could be used to get someone to Connecticut.  The other two brothers are thinking along the same lines, so they are also thinking about staying in Connecticut.  They might stay in a hotel in Connecticut, but they need to find the cash to drive the 2,000 miles they need to get from Ohio to Kentucky to Connecticut.  How do they plan to get the cash?\nProduction: How much of the $200 will the car owner and three other drivers need to get the total cost of driving to New Haven?\nThe car owner will need $200 to get the car to New Haven while spending most of his stay in New Haven.\nThe three brothers will need $300 to get the total cost for driving to New Haven.\nThe two car owners will need $370 to get the total cost to drive to New Haven.\nThat is $300 less than the cost for the car to travel from Ohio to Kentucky to New Haven.\nSo the final total is $370\n\nInput: John is a teacher in New Mexico.

Where is the cheapest way to get a car?\nOutput:\nSince you bought a car today, you will pay for it over the next 6 months.\nTherefore it will take 6 months to pay it off if you do not refinance.\nThus, buying a car today is the cheapest way to finance it today.\n\nInput:The president has been elected.

The profit has been steadily decreasing from the time that the business started.  The CEO (the business owner) is concerned that the company could go under, since it is taking a significant amount of money off the business owner\u2019s personal assets.  What is the CEO doing to help turn the business around?\nOutput: The CEO has hired an investment banker.  He has set up a $500,000 loan for the business.  He also has placed many people on loan/interest deferments so that they can afford to take their current positions which will likely have to be eliminated.  He has extended the life of the firm's lease by 15 years and reduced the mortgage interest on his home to a very low rate.  He has also begun to implement additional changes and has had his sales increase slightly.  He estimates that after all these changes, their sales will be on an even keel with 2006 levels.\nSo the final response to this question is A\n\nIn the following scenarios you were given the following clues:\n\ninput:The weather is nice in San Francisco. It is 60F outside and sunny. (There are two people at the airport. The 1st is headed to San Francisco, the 2nd is going home.)\noutput:The 1st is going to San Francisco and the 2nd is heading back to Los Angeles. Thus, the answer is\nA person going to San Francisco is expected to have warmer than average temperatures. He likely will experience a temperature of at least 65F. It is likely that the person going home will have a temperature of at least 68F.\nThis is because the two weather conditions are generally not comparable. So the answer to the question is\nA person going from Los Angeles to San Francisco should expect a temperature of at least 52F. So there is a reasonable range of temperature expected both for the person going home from Los Angeles and the person going to San Francisco.\n\nInput:There is a tropical system in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of the United States.

They are making an oil and gas discovery outside of town.  The field only has wells for gas and oil at the moment, but they may develop a whole oil-water complex eventually.  The company has been developing the field for 25 years and is now developing a complex project to bring in water.  When they first developed the project, there was about 10,000 feet of water present.  Some 10 years in the future they plan to use 2,000 feet of water and build an artificial lake.  A second well is needed for the artificial lake so that it can hold more freshwater.\nOutput: They are planning on using 50 thousand feet of water.  They will use that water on day 1, 2, 3, and 4 so that it will be in service by day 7.  On day 4, though, they will have to fill the lake with the old 100 thousand feet of water that the company just had removed.\nOn day 6, the 100 thousand feet that were removed from the field to be replaced by the lake will be put back in service so that they will have 1 million feet of water in service.\nOn day 7, they will start filling the lake by removing and replacing the old 100 thousand feet from the field, and once they build the artificial lake, the 1 million feet will be free to return to the field, returning the lake to what it was originally, with 50 thousand feet of fresh water in service.\nOutput: They will have 1.0.0.0.o00o1.0.0.00o01.00o02.00o03.00o04.00o5.00o6.00o7.00o8.00o9.00o20.00o11.00o20.0.00o20.10o10.00o10.0.\n\nInput:Where could there be a 10,000 person concert?

{"text": "The ground is getting wet.  Your answer is B.\nYou are probably going to get dry skin, but you need to be careful as you are not supposed to be outside for 72 hours after showering so you won\u2019t get dried out.  Also, the ground should be getting wet to a degree by now.  You will start getting dry skin as you do not shower for the required period.  Dry skin will not cause infection but it will start itching and the itchiness can be very uncomfortable.  Also, if you are going to stay out of the water a lot longer you should probably make sure that you are not going to be out there for more than 72 hours.  The question says 72 hours, so you should be there for at least that long.  I am going to say that you have gotten dry skin but you should not worry about it.  You will probably itch or itch a little to some degree, but it will not be the worst thing ever.  Do not worry about dry skin as it may not bother you too much.\nThe ground is getting wet.\nSo you are probably going to get a little bit of dry skin as you are not in water all the time.\nMy answer is D.  I have gotten dry skin, but it wasn\u2019t that bad.  It would have been pretty bad had I been out there for a longer amount of time.\nIt does seem like you are going to be in some weather but it shouldn\u2019t be that bad.\nMy answer is B.  You will probably get a little bit of wet skin as you aren\u2019t going inside for a long period of time.  It will make you itch, but it should not be that bad.  You should be okay for the 8 days or so.\nMy answer is C.  You will probably be getting dry skin because you aren\u2019t that long outside.\nAt least you won\u2019t be dry skin.  Your skin usually sticks to the ground regardless of how dry it is.  If your skin sticks to the ground without wetting then you are good.  As always, you should be careful how long you are out in the water even if you are fine.  You have to be careful to keep from getting skin rash or you may develop some skin infections.

They would need $1,000.01 to pay all their attorneys\u2019 fees.  So, Chris and Chris filed for bankruptcy.  How much would they owe their attorneys?\nOutput: $1,000.  So Chris owes his attorneys $200.\nIt was 5 months later when Chris and Chris filed for their pre-nuptial agreements.  Chris\u2019s pre-nuptial says $1,000,000.00, his pre-marital agreement with the same condition says $1,000. So his total debts are equal to $1,000,001.  So Chris owes $1,000,002 as his attorneys\u2019 fees.\nSo $100,000.60 will cover Chris and Chris\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and they will need $200,000.60 to pay off their debts in the case.  After all debts are completely erased, they are left with $150,000.\nSo $150,000.60 will pay for Chris and Chris\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees. So $150,000.00 is the final answer and $150,000.20 covers their attorneys\u2019 fees and their debts are completed.\nInput: The two boys were standing outside watching an old man fishing in the river beside them.

Joe says, \"Now you get to use that money on a car instead,\" and hires John to fix Joe's car.  The two men meet at Joe's place and the job is getting started.  They start by measuring John's friend\u2019s truck, but only have enough room for the pickup truck.  After removing the battery, though, they realize that he needs an auxiliary battery in order to drive his car, so they remove the auxiliary battery and replace it with a battery that fits in the pickup.  Once in the car, they start moving the car to its new location.  They get to Joe\u2019s place and both men start the car, ready to drive it to Joe.  As soon as they take off, they note that their truck's battery appears to be running low.  Soon the battery runs flat, too.  So they remove their truck again, swap trucks, and drive down to Joe's house to replace the battery in his truck.  They then move the truck back up to the guy's house and start the process of moving it to his new home.  They eventually do it, though, and once in the house John decides that this is the one and only car that he wants to drive.

He expected a total yield of 13 tons per acre.  However, one planting was very unproductive so he decided to plant a second crop.  He had already planted the second crop when a tree falling on top of his crop damaged his crop and he had no choice but to destroy it.  After he did that, no other trees fell on his crops, and he realized his yield would have been 20 tons per acre (13 tons per acre), or 15 tons per acre (14 tons per acre)--a total of 31 tons per acre.

A police officer, who had witnessed the robbery, was accused of breaking both the patron\u2019s nose and lip, and the officer was charged with criminal mischief and resisting arrest. The customer, however, suffered only minor injuries.  A federal district court dismissed the suit on the ground that the victim did not meet the requirements for a cause of action for personal injury under federal law, which makes it unlawful for a police officer, acting within the scope of his employment and under the circumstances of a particular case, to cause another to suffer a property injury, especially that \u201cto deprive the Plaintiff of his or her fundamental economic interests in property without just cause.\u201d In re Biscuit and Cheese, 621 F.2d 827 (3d Cir. 1981).  Based on this decision, if a police officer breaks the nose of a patron who assaults him and he injures the patron, the police officer in no way violated the Constitutional rights of either the patron or the officer, and the patron may bring a suit for damages against the cop. Accordingly, you have three questions:  1. Do the constitutional requirements for a cause of personal injury apply to a police officer who breaks something if a patron hits him?  2. Do police officers violate the Constitution if they hit a patron on the street who has never been accused", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

{"text": "A) A and B) C) D) E)F)G)\n\nInput: There is one person who is doing yard work for a neighbor, and their neighbor has been out of the country for three years and lost all of his income. So they are asking each neighbor to bring $60 back in change to get the money back that was lost.  So the first month of $240, the first payment of $60, and the return on the money will be 60x90/3.\nOutput: So in the first month you will have 40 x $240 = $160.\nThe first payment will take 60$ /90 = 60$ so $60 x 20/90 = 60$. You will be paid $240 for the first day. Then in the next month your second payment will be 60$ x 90 = $60$. Then you will get paid 60$ + 60$ a month for the next two months, and 60$ for the next two months and 60$ for the remainder of your months.\nSo if all of that is $160, you have received a $480 payment in 2 months.\nSo your payment total will be $480 x 2 = $960.\nSince each month you get paid $240 you will only have to pay for the 2 months for which you get paid. Plus you will get $480 over 2 months.\nSo, $320 minus $80 from paying the $240 for the 4.5 months, and $240 minus $40 from paying $240 for the 12.5 months, you will be left with a balance of $480 / 12.5 = $160.\nSo, $160 plus $240 gives you a $360 payment which is what the next owner of the land is asking. It means that the first day you get paid $240, you will also get paid $360 each month, so $240 or $360 in total.\nSo your payment is $720, then $720 minus $120 from paying for the 4.5 to 12.5 months, and you will have a total payment of $720 over 12.5 months.\nFrom here you can divide that payment by 12 to find the square footage of the house. The square footage of your house is $1200, so your payment will be $240 per month. This gives you $720 per month. After 12.5 months you will have paid $720. So your payment is $720 per month or $720 x 12 to give you", "answer": "B: populated area"}

He could save an additional $8,000 per year.\nThus, his home mortgage would pay off (in 2 years) $56,000 of his credit card debt.\nSo he would have an annual income of $62,000 a year if he saved $32,000 annually.\nSo the final income is $56,000/2 = $20,000.\nAverage interest rates and the cost of a 20 year mortgage are 8.0% for a balance of $500,000 and 7.00% for a balance of over $1,000,000.\nSo his interest payment for 10 years would be $8,000 plus a $2,500 charge for the home mortgage.\nSo a 20 year mortgage would total $24,000.  He would have an income of $50,000 plus taxes of $18,000 and mortgage interest taxes of $8,000\nSo his yearly income and his yearly interest costs are $55,000\nSo the total income is $50,000*0.75% = $", "answer": "A: relaxation"}

One doctor came up with the following: 2,500 passengers were killed in an airplane crash in 1979, but the pilot was found to be incompetent! How can you be sure?\nOutput: If the pilot was found incompetent, then this would be the second worst plane crash ever, right behind an airplane crash where 2,500 people were killed in 1985.\nIf the pilot was found to have crashed his plane without losing control, with two of them being killed who would that leave?\nIf the pilot was not incompetent, and crashed his plane without losing any lives, who might this leave?\n\nInput: 2,500 passengers died when an airplane crashed in 1979.  The pilot said that there was no one to save them, so he didn\u2019t want to pull the fire alarm.  He then said to the captain, \u201cIf there are 10 persons inside this building, then only 90-90 = 60-60=15%.  So if there were 90 people, then only 85-85 = 75-75=20%.  And if there are only 200 people, then only 105-105 = 60-60=10%.  So, in order for the pilot to save more lives, then 5% of the passengers had to die.  So if all 2,500 people died, then each of those would have to die exactly the same number of times as if there were 500.  That would leave 55-55=40.  So in order for the pilot\u2019s words (\u201cIf there are 10 people inside this building, and I need to pull the fire alarm, then it should only be me and 5 others that need to be rescued right now\u201d) to be correct, then we\u2019d have to let 5, 100 people die before pulling the fire alarm.

{"text": "A beaver builds a structure to block a stream or river.  The beaver builds a series of towers made of logs, each topped with a different object.  These structures are lined with brushwood.  The beaver\u2019s dams fill most of the water but a relatively shallow path leads through a natural water fall to the sea.  The natural spring can hold about half an acre of water.

Answer:  Beaver and Woodpecker.  Also what is the name of a beaver from a wooded area which has been built upon?\nOutput:  The Beaver family is probably named after the two beavers (2) built this spring.  The family\u2019s name was probably derived from one of two sources:  one being a historical group that lived in the area for 1,000 years.  The name was probably derived from the animals\u2019 distinctive beady eyes.  The family\u201dwoodpecker\u201d may have been derived from the animal\u2019s distinctive call.  Mary, Mary, did you know that beavers live in a wooded valley?  And did you know many beaver dams build over water to protect fish?

Spending cuts will likely be required to reduce the deficit even after a sufficient number of stimulus payments are received to offset stimulus spending.  Cuts would be acceptable after stimulus money has been distributed to citizens for income tax benefits, child tax credit supplements, and other stimulus programs.  *An additional $11 billion in stimulus payments should be provided to those who have been forced to quit work due to layoffs by businesses impacted by the recession.  An additional $10 billion in stimulus payouts should be provided to businesses who have been forced to close their doors.  *The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains an additional $1 billion in funding for infrastructure programs.

This statistic is based on one study  that did not include the number of dogs that are kept as pets.   When the statistics are averaged among the 6 million dogs,  the average number of dogs is 12 million.

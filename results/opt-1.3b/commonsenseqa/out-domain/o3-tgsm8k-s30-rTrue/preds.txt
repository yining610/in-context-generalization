How could he buy a car at $200 for $0.25 a day (and a car charger for $10 a day) plus take home his lunch, food, etc.  Also, how could he get groceries at $2-$50 a day (plus a few more items that his wife might bring home) for $200 a week?  There was no work available so John decided not to work.  What was he spending his money on?<n>Output: $1.24 ($0.25 and $10) = $0.25 × 1.24 = $0.50 × 1.50 = $1.00 for 14 days<n>That comes to $2.00 a day. If he doesn't need a car, he could also pay $0.50 per day ($0.50 and $0.50) and that comes to $0.25 per day.<n>What is John spending his money on? Car Charger $10 $0.25 = $0.25<n>$0.24 (8 days) = $10 × 0.50 = $2.00<n>So, $0.50 on Car Charger = $0.50 on his food.  To be on the safe side, you'd buy food at $1.00 for $2.00 × 14 days = $5.00.  That's $5.00 that will be spent.<n>So the $4.00 is coming from the car charger, but you'll also spend $5.00 in food.

Answer: Total Oil Spill Company.  They average 3,500 gallons per week but are required to have a total of 25 different type of engines.  The engine they have has 6 blower engines so they have to have 6 blower engines in addition to the 6 type of engines which means they have at least 13 different blowers and all of these 13 different blowers are made with different brands. So in order to fill up a tank of their oil (3,500 gallons) they must have 13 different brands of engines on their entire assembly line.  Since their oil contains 10 different types of lubricants.<n>Which means, Total Oil Spill Company has 3,500 gallons of 10 different types of lubricant on their production line.  Therefore 3,500 gallons = 3000 gallons of 10 different types lubricants.<n>Total Oil Spill Company has their oil on their production line at least twice a day because, if they do not have the correct type of lubricant on their line, the lubricant will seep through and stain their equipment. So they must have at least 6 different types of equipment and, in order to have 27 different blowers, their production line must have at least 12 different types of engines.<n>Which means the total amount of lubricant being used by Total Oil Spill Company is at least 3,500 gallons.  Therefore Total Oil Spill Company must use a minimum of 30,000 gallons of petroleum per week.<n>Total is the company that supplies the U.S. military with oil so they are required to have a minimum of 3000 gallons of oil that they can use for oil tankers and on their assembly line (since their oil contains 10 different type of lubricants).<n>In order for Total to have at least 3000 gallons of oil on their oil production line, they must use a minimum of 3200 gallons of oil per day.<n>They also use a minimum of 10 blower engines on their assembly line so each time they pump oil to the oil tanks, they have to

Input:  If a paper is folded at one axis, at least one component of the paper is of length more than the paper if folded at another axis, at least one of them is a little shorter than the paper if folded in a different axis than the paper being folded at the other axis. Output:  If a paper folded at one axis is perpendicular to its axis, the paper is parallel to its axis and would have no more than two dimensions; similarly, if a paper is parallel to its two axis, at least one or both of them is longer than the paper if folded only at one axis; if a paper is parallel but not perpendicular to its axis, at least one part of the paper has a little longer component than its axis; and thus, at least one of the paper is of greater length than if that part were parallel to its axis.<n>Input:  Suppose a sheet of paper has 8 dimensions, then its length is equal to its width minus its height.  Given 2 parallel sheets having the same length and width, the longer dimensions (1 and 2) of one sheet measure one and one-half times as long as the corresponding dimensions (1 and 2), then the shorter dimensions (3 and 4) of the other sheet measure one-third as long as the corresponding dimension(s), so in this particular case a sheet of paper having four dimensions is equal to a sheet of paper having 8 or more dimensions. When a paper is parallel to itself, it is perpendicular to half of 8 or 5 or 3, and thus is not parallel to the other half of 8 or 5.<n>Input:<n>a.A sheet of paper having 8 dimensions is equal to a paper with eight dimensions if the paper is folded along the same dimension.<n>b.If a sheet of paper is not parallel to itself, then it has no less than four dimensions.<n>c.If a paper is parallel but perpendicular to itself, then its total dimension is 16 or 6 times as many dimensions, as the dimension along its axis<n>d.If a paper is not parallel to its axis, it has two dimensions.<n>e.If a paper is perpendicular to its own axis, then its total dimension can be expressed as being equal to its cross-sectional area in the plane perpendicular to its own axis + 1.05 x

At that point, the sun heats up the sand and he can’t sleep again. He decides to try again on the next swing and the pain from the hot sand makes him fall asleep again. After a few more swings, he decides to go back to sleep and try again tomorrow. When he goes to sleep again tomorrow he falls asleep again. This goes on until he wakes up to the hot sand aching. He decides to keep going until he becomes bored with it all. After another hour or two he starts getting tired of the sand so he decides to go back on the swing. Then he tries another hour. Then he decides not to go back on the sand until he can stop feeling the pain in his foot. After another hour he decides to call his wife. She thinks he’s not moving or paying attention to her, but he is trying to sleep. After about another hour, she gets mad and says it doesn’t count as sleeping until he stops moving. He then says it is getting too hot in here so he decides he’ll just lie here for a while. So she drives him to the water. After they eat dinner and she leaves, he goes back to sleeping on the sand.

Choices:  A: suicide B: overdosing C: sadness D: murder E: cyanide<n>Output:		 The person has had one suicide attempt, two attempts, and an overdose.<n>Each attempt (1) can be made if the death is imminent.  The person tried to commit suicide with cyanide or with some other substance that may lead to death.  The death did not occur right then and there, therefore 2 attempts can be made.  The person tried two other methods, the suicide or in an emergency.  Therefore, 8 attempts are required to be made before the person's death is imminent.  And then only 3 attempts must be made before his death is imminent.<n>The person tried suicide several times, each one resulting in an overdose.  The second attempt on suicide caused a death.  Then he tried many, many attempts on suicide.  Each failure resulted in an overdose.<n>Since there is one single attempt which resulted in death and 8 attempts before death is imminent, then 10 attempts were needed to get from A to a death.  The person had 10 failed suicide attempts until he succeeded and had the overdose.<n>Since there are 9 failures then 3 attempts are necessary to get to death.  Therefore 10 attempts are needed to reach death.  Consequently, since it took 9 attempts to get to death, it took 11 attempts to reach death.<n>That is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:A child is playing with a toy that can hold up to 1 gallon of liquid, a jar that holds 2 gallons, a cup that holds 5 gallons and a bucket that holds 8 gallons.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

You need a car but you’re planning to use the rental car on one of your business trips to the other side of town.  What would it cost to buy an extra car if you rented it for a week?<n>Output: Renting an extra car should cost you between $50.00-65.00-100.00 depending on the number of days you rent it.

Choices:  A: opera B: supermarket C: building D: conference E: apartment<n>Output:		 There are a few options that people may find food but most will look elsewhere.  A: opera The opera is very important because people will not have access to food unless they attend or order food online through the opera<n>This will create demand for food, but it may not create enough demand to get most of the people in the opera to find food.<n>The supermarket or supermarket/hypermarket will have the greatest amount of success in making people eat out, and will need an incentive to create demand.  Food prices are likely to be raised along with other prices of other commodities.  And many of them may be affected indirectly because they will make other parts of their business more expensive and may create a shortage of certain food or products at some point in the future.  The building may not be as attractive as the opera because of its high rent.<n>The apartment should be one of the least popular choices.  People may just buy food at home and skip the building, so the building will probably not have very high supply at any point.<n><n>Input:Who is more likely to die in an earthquake?

He is concerned that he may be able to get additional financing for the new addition if he rents out his existing home to a neighbor at a price of $200.00 per month, plus a 2% commission to him.  He is trying to decide if this is a good deal given the amount of work involved and the high value of the addition.  He also believes that when a neighbor rents the new addition out the price should be reduced due to an increase in market value since the house is being used to rent out the newly built addition.    The owner’s new addition measures a mere 16 feet x 30 feet and his existing home measures 22 feet x 35 feet.  Can you tell him whether or not renting the house out does a fair deal or if he should go ahead with the build?<n>Output: The buyer of the new addition will get a 2% commission as an advance for the cost of the initial home construction.  However, the house will cost $500.00 but will be the property of the buyer for the life of the mortgage.  After 1 year there will be a one-time increase of 50 cents per month.  The total cost of the build/rental transaction will be $250,000 at an estimate of 17% annual interest payments on 5 year loans.  At the end of the build/rent period the total cost of the buy/lease transaction will be $750,000.00.  An increase of $250,000.00 does not equate to $750,000.  The total cost for a new addition to the existing house is $625,000.00.<n>Output: The cost of buying the new addition is $625,000, the cost of building the addtion is $375,000 and the average price the addtion is rented for is $200.00.  Therefore the new addition will probably be the home only of one user, and that owner will make a good deal on this build/rent transaction.<n><n>Input: How many acres does a football field occupy when measured in square feet?

The idea is to be able to reduce or recycle large quantities of paper and create an economic system for reuse.  The goal is to divert high-quality sheets from landfills and reduce trash generated in the recycling industry. What do you think should be done to help develop a recycling service in a region where large population density and few recycle centers are available?<n>Output:In many parts of the world, the need for recycling paper is high. There are large markets for the recycling of paper, which means there can be large volumes of paper processed, requiring thousands of employees. The main goal of recycling is to divert waste from landfills and increase economic opportunities for individuals in the recycling industry. One way to provide job opportunities to individuals is through a local paper recycling company.  A paper recycling program would give paper recyclers the resources and incentive needed to help increase the processing volume in the local region.    What are the potential effects of a paper recycling program in the USA?<n>Output:  A paper recycling program could help reduce both costs and waste. For example, each individual will save money on paper costs when less paper is required for their projects.  For companies, they find that paper recycling programs are cost-effective as they save time and reduce the number of employees involved in handling the paper.<n>Input:In response to the statement<n>“Paper and cardboard contain much high quality material that can be used as sources of energy or raw materials.”   How could a program that would create an economic incentive for paper recycling reduce the amount of energy required to recycle?<n>Output: As a result of the recycling process paper, which takes energy, is transformed into a useful product. Paper can be converted from one application to another and reused.  Thus, recycling programs increase economic opportunities for industry and individuals. For example, paper is a viable raw material that can be used to manufacture a variety of products, such as paper and plastic.<n>Input: The paper and cardboard industry in Europe is an economic force to be reckoned with. Paper has become one of the most important raw materials in the world, and paper manufacturing facilities have multiplied in the regions where this industry is developed.  According to Eurostat, Europe has an estimated 7-8 million tonne paper industry employing 7-8.

Which one of these three exams is easiest in terms of a single, simple 50% question?<n>Output: A) Chemistry B) Physics C) Literature D) English<n>There are three exams.  One is a 50% which earns 100%.  Another is a 90% which earns 75%.  The third is an 80% which earns 50%.<n>There are 50 students who have completed the exams and so 100 out of 100 passes earns 50%.<n>So if one student’s exam is easier than 50% of all the others it is 50% easy which equals 25%.  The same applies to having no easy question. Therefore, 30% the 20 students who pass the exam earns 6 points and 6% the other 40 students who pass the exam earn 2 points<n>So 20% the 60 students who pass the exam can earn 8% for any of the three exams.<n>So 40% the 60 students who passed the exam earn 8% for any one of the three exams. Therefore, 20% the 30 students who passed the exam can earn 2% for any of the exams.<n>The total pass is 60% which is $1,500.  So the final answers is $2,500 for the 100%.

So one day’s $150 = $150 * 10 = $200.<n>He put all 100 pencils into case A so it cost him 100*10= $300.00<n>So his final total is $450.00<n>So his total pencil budget for 2 weeks was $150.00 * 10 = $400.00<n>So he only used 1 pencil case and 1 desk drawer.<n>So his final pencil budget for the entire time of his stay at the desk drawer was $200.00 * 10 =$400.00<n>So his pencil budget for 2 weeks in the office was $40.00 * 10 = 50<n>So he needed to buy 4 pencil cases so he bought 2 each for $200.00<n>So his budget for 2 weeks in his room and office was $150.00 x 4 pencil cases = $50.00 * 10 =.$100.00 = $200.00<n>If he wanted to have two boxes of pencils, he would have needed $200 x 2 pencil cases for a total of $360.00.<n>So his total budget for two weeks was $120.00 x 4 pencils = $400.00 which is only $50 less than what everyone else paid<n>So his final total was only 50.00 less than everyone else<n>So his pencil budget is 5.00 * 10 = 5.00<n>So his weekly budget was $550.00 for the 5 weeks<n>So his salary was $150.00<n>So his monthly budget was $560.00<n>Thus his hourly rate was $60.00<n>So he was making $200/hour<n>That’s $1.50/hour more than everyone else and we’re not counting his pencil budget.<n>And he gave us the answer by writing the answer on the board instead of giving someone else an opportunity to do it on their own

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Example: The member of the ladies group in the church goes away for a week and the members ask their sister if they have any errands or things they could do.  The sister says they could leave the house to buy groceries.  It was not unusual for the lady in the house to go over and buy food or some similar item on the way.  If the sister needed money she could borrow it from the lady in the house.  If the sister had no money in her account she could borrow money from the lady in the car or car-rental agency.

Choices:  A: movie B: cape kennedy C: space center D: military installation E: spaceship centre<n>Output:		 If the launch site for the Cape Kennedy spaceport was the “Space Center” then the options are Movie: “The Cape Kennedy Space Center”  If the Cape Kennedy spaceport is not labeled, it is the “Military Installation”  It is the “Space Center and The Cape Kennedy”  In either case, the Cape JFK Space Center is the launch pad for military rocket launches. If it is not labeled “Launch Pad “, it is the ” Space Center and The Cape Kennedy Space Center“<n>Each site has two points in it. The cape Kennedy spaceport and the Cape Kennedy Space Center. The ” Space Center and the ” Cape Kennedy Space Center “<n>They are separated by hundreds of miles of ocean between each other. One point is on the west coast and the other point is on the east coast and thus they are separated by hundreds of millions of miles of ocean between them. If they both were labeled as the ” Cape Kennedy Spaceport “ then the choices:  If the Cape Kennedy Spaceport is labeled then the choice: “If the Cape Kennedy Spaceport” is labeled then the choices: ” Movie: The Cape Kennedy Spaceport ” if it is not labelled “Cape Kennedy Spaceport ”<n>The Cape Kennedy was the launch pad for military space launches in the last 50 years or so. It is not called and it isn’t called Cape Kennedy.   So the choices:<n>If Cape Kennedy Space Center is the Cape Kennedy Space Center then the choice: ” Movie: Cape Kennedy Spaceport ‘’ ”<n><n>The above questions are examples of questions that could be included in a math textbook. In real life though many question might be asked such as: 1) How many gallons of water are in the Pacific Ocean? 2) What’s the height of the Statue of Liberty? 3) What’s 5 miles east of the equator?<n><n>I hope this provides you a good insight into real life math and I am glad to be of help.

Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n>Output:		 It screws something together:Chain ring, necklace, wall outlet fixtures, computer<n>Rigging the tool box is a little more involved since some of the nuts don’t turn and you have to unscrew a nut on the front cover at the top of the case. The wrench can also be a little fiddly to find to tighten it.  The motorcycle is also a little fiddly as it doesn’t have a quick release like the screw ring does. It just snaps on.  But you may be able to remove the stock exhaust from the engine box instead of the muffler to get the bike to fit into the car.  Just unplug the engine so you can lift the stock exhaust and put it on the car.<n>Since it is a motorcycle, that’s a problem since the box is usually locked.  You can try opening the door and sliding part way open, but that isn’t going to get it open.  You’ll probably damage the door frame as well along the way.<n>If you can figure out how to remove the stock exhaust, you can try turning off the engine to lift it up and then lifting it up the same way back to the original position.  You can also turn it off before lifting it, but you may damage it.<n><n>Input: A customer comes in to the hardware store and has a hardware problem.

There was a small closet behind the door. They’d try to go to sleeping in it.  At best, they could lay on the floor in it, but sleeping there would be a big problem for the dog.   The closet’s ceiling was low. Since it was only about 6 feet off the floor, it would be a little uncomfortable, and the dog might start licking the walls.   But, at least they could keep a dry mouth.   They settled on sleeping there but with a blanket over the floor. Since the walls on the other side of the room were concrete, their blankets would be a little warmer.  It would be better than sleeping on the floor. If they got too hot they could flip their blankets up for a little cool air. They could lay on the floor during those first couple times, since it was really sticky at times.

The dog got in there occasionally, but mostly it was them moving around with the bags, or the dog laying on the rug while the dog lay in one or the other.  Since they couldn’t just keep taking turns to sleep there, they went on the floor.  It was only about 9 feet by 10 feet, enough space to lie down a little.  On the

His wife was angry and upset with him, but at the same time she was extremely proud that he was doing well.<n><n>Input: John is a salesperson for a business that specializes in home furnishings.  His office is at an airport close to where a large convention is taking place.  Because business is slow, they do a lot of business in the airport.  In the winter, business is so slow that the airline stops advertising in the airport to increase passenger traffic.  To help with the lack of business in the airport, in 2009, they were planning to build a new convention center.  After a meeting with the airport manager, a local developer approached the airport to propose that the development be built just a few blocks from the convention center.  The developer’s name is Jim, and he has three children who are all in college.  They have lived in the area for 10 years, and they love the area.  They wanted to help the area with building and renovation.  To make this happen, they wanted to fund the new convention center.  Because of the lack of business, the airport has not needed to charge any airport fees and has lost revenue.  When the airport manager heard about this proposal, he had one question: “How many houses can they afford to build?”  The airport manager said that because they don’t have any houses, they had to charge $150.00 per house that they were building.  Since the airport had no money (or any revenue) to build the new convention center, he was worried that they would be unable to build the convention center.  John talked about various ways that his business could help the airport.  The airport manager said, “How many of your cars can you fit in a parking lot?”  The salesperson asked, “How many can I fit?”  John said, “One of the new houses that they’re building will fit in their parking lot.” (John is a car salesman)<n>So the passenger traffic has decreased, so they are losing money because of construction and have no money for their parking lot.  The airport’s parking fee would cover the money that they don

The medical community in the middle ages believed they could save lives by attaching a portion of the body to the outside of the body and feeding the body blood from the leeches. When the medieval Christian church banned leeches in 1209, it was at the behest of the Church of Rome that the medical community decided to end the use of blood-feeding leeches and turned its attention to the practice of donating blood. Until recently, blood-feeding leeches were considered to be a very dangerous practice. But in 1997, the National Institutes of Health established a program to study how the blood feeding leeches that were banned from the early 15th century on have reestablished themselves over time as a life-saving alternative to blood transfusion for medical patients.<n><n>Input: What is the length of time a typical woman would have to work for to save $1,000,000?<n>Output: The time required to save $1,0000,000 would be 40 years at 30 hours per week<n>This would mean that a typical woman would work for 40 years at 30 hours a week in order to save that amount of money.

Choices:  A: from the sky B: map C: cross counties by car D: country E: michigan<n>Output:		County Lines are Lines on Earth, County Highway are Lines in the Field. Each Country/State line has one or more County highways in addition to the one or more County towns/cities shown on the map.  They are also called States/Counties because these are different levels of Government (Government, County, Township, County Park District/School District, Township Highway District, School District/Township).  Therefore the Highway and County lines are different.  As a result, there are many different definitions for each.  So be careful interpreting the road signs.  As stated in the Highway Department’s website,<n>“A highway is a road traveled over by public and owned vehicles. A county is any part of a state or territory which has the power to make laws for public roads, but which is exempt from the jurisdiction of the State or Territory.  A State Highway is generally the same as a county highway; see State Highway.”<n><n>The Federal Highway Administration defines the word road:<n>“Road means the entire network of wayside structures connected by highways (both state and federal). From a highway stand point, road is a means by which a person may travel from one place to another.”<n>A highway is actually the roads, state and federal highways.  A county and highway are two different meanings.  As stated above, each State Highway and State town Road is different and thus each County Highway is different and so are the County Highway/Township Roads that link those County Highway/Township Road’s.<n>To use your County Highway and Township Highway as a county road means that it is a State Highway.  To connect a Highway and County Highway can mean that it has the power to lay rails, cut corners, widen and fix roads, pave roadways, etc.  Therefore, the County Highway is also called a State Highway.  A county or highway with the power to lay tracks, etc., is called a City Highway.  In Michigan, there were 17 cities and 10 towns and counties.  So when you look at the county highways, you might also notice that there may be more than one county highway with the power to build the roadways and perform other tasks that are not city and town highways.<n><n>The definition of a county line has several definitions; however, generally the definition is in the U.S. Code section entitled “The Interstate and Defense Highway System” which provides two definitions,<n>The first one states that

They will pay the $500 (total rental) by the end of the 7 months and have to pay an initial fee of $100 as well. The agency also charges $35/day or $140/day (total rental) for maintenance of the house. The person must also pay on days that they are not taking care of the house.  Assuming that he keeps the house in perfect condition, he must pay between $100 and $200 per month (total rental).

She would use C for both the selection and job.  She would get Fry’s and Walmart at a savings.  She would get Giant Food at a discount because of her lower price, but still wouldn’t be able to buy much because of the price difference.<n>So, A and D would both be the choice.  And A is the way to go here.  However, if you’re in a store and you’d rather get something that you can’t go to a specific store for or is outside your own immediate area, your plan B should be C if I’m being honest.<n>Output: C is the appropriate answer here<n><n>Input: A guy in the military has to get back to Texas after 4 months.

The consumer is given a ”card’ which may contain the items of interest.  From here on, the producer takes care of the end user.  The consumer may now choose where to buy items like detergents, flushing products and toilet paper.  The retailer provides the product and may be the provider of the “card” to the consumer.  Once the consumer completes the transaction, he may have more items in that bag, or maybe some items he was never able to buy.  If this is true of the first transaction, it will likely be true of subsequent purchases.  The second transaction will likely use the same model.  The end user may find that he ‘loses’ some products in the transaction.  If he likes the first transaction, this will not be a problem, but if he likes the second transaction, he will either want them back, or at least be pleased to find that they were in the transaction in the first place.  The second transaction can be done at other retailers and with merchants.  Or it can be done privately between the consumer and the retailer.  Or it can even be done between the consumers and the merchant.<n>Output: The product must then be put back into the bag.<n>Thus, if the product has been in the bag, the payment must be placed back into the bag.  This is a good thing, since many consumers are frugal.<n><n>Input: A couple has traveled across Europe and now are staying in Paris for a few days and they want to be sure that they are not robbed.

Choices:  A: were thirsty B: toasting C: getting drunk D: refreshment E: celebrating<n>Output:		 everybody raised a drink and cheered; most people have a drink while raising the drink.  Most people have a drink while the toast is being made so a person having a toast is only a person drinking the drink.  A person who is partaking in a toast is the one who is partaking in the toast.  Since most people want to drink the beverage which is being raised; they must be partaking in the toast and therefore the toast being made by is a person partaking in the beverage. So most people are partaking in a toast.  This could then lead to a few people having several drinks at the same time.  Because this is not a simple drinking game; you need many people to participate to have fun.  This is one or many people taking a drink at the same time if the person partaking in the toast can keep from getting drunk; they are partaking in a drink.<n>Output: Everybody raised a glass of wine, drank while the toast was being made and cheered.  Most people have the ability to keep from getting drunk from the alcohol they drink; this could be partaking in the drink or it could be someone else drinking the drink; since most people get drunk, it would be partaking in a drink or it could be a toast.<n>Output: There were two groups, one group had a toast and the other group did not.  Everyone cheered; there were two people being partaking in a toast (one of which is the person who raised the glass); they are both being partaking in the toast (as most people get drunk).  Most people raised a drink; they were partaking in the toast or another person was raising another glass of wine.<n>Output: A group of people were doing a drink, people were cheering; there were several people being partaking; they were all partaking in a drink but some people got drunk (thus a toast) and some people didn’t.<n>Output: Most people were raising drinks while the toast was being raised; they were being partaking or the toast was being made.<n>Output: The toast was being done by a person who was partaking in a drink; thus they are partaking in the toast with alcohol in it.<n>Output: A person who drinks a drink with alcohol in it is partaking in a drink with alcohol.<n>Output: An individual raising a drink is a person partaking.<n>Output: Many people drank while the toast was raised.<n>Output: There was a toast done

Choices:  A: opened B: closed C: found at shower D: falling down E: locked<n>Output:		The cat isn’t allowed to climb on the bed, however in the other areas she can.  That’s because there are two different sets of closed and opened doors for the bedroom in the house.  The owner uses the set which is the closed door, A, while in the living room.  In the bedroom, she uses the set that opens B.  The owner also has a lock on the bathroom door because the door to the walk-in shower is closed.  So, even the cat can’t get into the bathroom.  So, only the owner should have a key to enter the bathroom.  So let’s go with, B.  The owner has the key, but no one else knows how to find it or put it in right.  So, A is the answer!

He’d pay $3.50 per mile.  Should he pay $2.50 or $4.00 for this haul?<n>Output: He should pay $2.50.  Mileage plus tolls would come out to $3.50.<n>The cost of one trip is $3.50. 2 trips is $6.50 and 3 trips is $21.50.<n>If this was a trucking company, the price per mile that they charge for their truck would be $3.50.  If it was a travel agency they would charge $2.50.<n>But it’s not a trucking company.  It’s a car rental.  It’d be a car rental agency so it’d likely be $4.00.<n>He should pay $2.00 per mile.<n><n>Input: Jason rented a car for 14 days for $100.  The rental car has a fuel economy of 15 mpg.  What is the maximum mileage that a rental car can cover in 14 days?<n>Output: He’s getting a maximum of 1600 miles out of his rental car.<n>At 1500 miles per day Jason will need to stop to charge the battery three times. He needs to charge it when he takes the car on his first full charge or when he gets to the end of the 14 day rental contract. He’ll charge it at the end of the 2nd full day of his rental, when he takes the car home and that’ll be the 3rd full charge.  He’ll need to charge it at the end when he gets home after a 24 hour break.  So at the end of the 14 days he’ll need to have his car on the road for 6500 miles or 14 days.<n>So 1000 miles traveled in 14 days equals $100.00<n><n>Output: He rented a car for 14 Days and got 3500 miles out of it.  He got 55MPG and only paid $100.00 in gas and tolls.<n>In this case he got 3500 miles plus 60% of his salary.

If B is true, then his mail is held by the thief.  If C is true, then the thief has no physical access to mailboxes which means the thief either stole it while it was parked outside or he is either a thief or left the mail box open when he was in the building and the mail was stolen in transit.  If D is true, the mail would have been returned in a day.<n>If E is true, the stolen mail would have been retrieved by the rightful owner.<n><n>Input: A man comes to a convenience store, and asks for a lottery number. He is told that he cannot get a number until he pays cash ($20.00). The man insists on using a prepaid phone card to give him a specific number, and it costs him $5.00 for the phone card. The man then buys lottery tickets for $5.00 each and comes back for another phone card. He is told it takes 7 phone cards ($10.00) to give him a lottery number. The man then purchases $100.00 worth of lottery tickets, and comes back to get more $500.00 worth. He is told it will cost $2,000.00 each.  Should he simply go shopping for lottery tickets?<n>If B is true, then a thief has purchased the man’s phones which has resulted in the theft of his information.  If C is false, then a thief has stolen his lottery tickets which has resulted in the receipt of his information, but the number was lost due to the theft of his phone.  Since he has paid in advance, the money he spends entitles him to a free ticket.<n>If E is correct, a thief was hired to bring in the man’s phone and steal his lottery tickets so that they would not have to pay him.

Bill, who rents out beds, sleeps in the bottom-most room.  Mary, who is renting a bedroom, sleeps in the top-most room.  Which room sleeps more and which room is less expensive?<n>Output: Since they sleep in different rooms, the cheaper room is the one with beds in it.<n>Since Bed 3 is the one without beds in it, it should cost less than Bed 4.<n>This does not give us information as to how much the house is worth, because Bill is not renting out beds.

If you put a sad man, maybe watch something that will inspire you to get back to your diet, and if you put a porn star, watch something that is not a porn. I'd suggest seeing the porn star if nothing else because he/she will probably tell you that if they were paid enough they wouldn't mind giving head to you. If you make head, then you'll probably just blow a load. If you don't blow a load, there is nothing to return to.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input:A government seeks what over it's people?

His car has 500 miles on it, if it should need a repair the cost will be about $100.00, the total cost is $280.00 per day. How much, in money will he pay at the end of the 22 days?<n>Output: Jason will pay $280.00 at the end of day 22.<n><n>Input:A rancher runs a total of 40 horses.  On average he has 4 horses available at any time for $400.00 per horse.  He would like to rent the horses for 3 months at a cost of $400.00 for each horse.  However, the number of horses at any given time and the condition of the horses will likely change.  Therefore, he needs the opportunity to negotiate with the horse supplier as to the rate to the end of the 3 months.  If he gives the horse supplier a fixed price at the beginning of the 3 months (and negotiates an increase to an average price at the end of the 3months) what is the price he will pay the horse supplier if the average price at the end is better than the price he gave at the beginning?<n>Output: He will pay his horse supplier the sum of $400.00 (42*4=<<42*4=210>>210)<n><n>Input:Jason asks you to rent his car for $30.00 per day.  The cost of a rental is $160.00 a day.  The total cost is $800 per month.  When you take into account the cost of gas you will see how much he spends.  If you had to get a loan to cover the cost of the rental then he has $650 a month.  When you subtract your monthly cost to keep the rental it gives you $530 a month.  What does a $600 a month save you over a six month period?<n>Output: If you take a $600 a month charge for the rental you would have $260.00 extra each month.<n>Taking the minimum amount of $60 per month would still only bring him $265, leaving him $215 less a month than the $600 a month charge with the same level of expenses.<n><n>Input:John is renting a car for 14 days, and plans to travel to Oregon to buy a house. He also wants the car checked out by a

To calculate this number, use this formula<n><n>Input: The average annual growth of the U.S. Agriculture Department, since the Great Depression. To find this using this formula, subtract the number of years since 1929 from 1950. Thus, 1950 = 3 x 1929 = 6. Now subtract the number of years between 1938 and 1944 from 1950. Thus, 1945 = 4 x 1938 = 12. So, 12 x 1939 = 20. So, 1930 = 15. Now divide the numbers between 1939 and 1944 by the number of years between 1937 and 1944 (since the beginning of the 40s). Thus, 1940 = 3.4 x 1938 = 9. So, 1939 = 6.4 + 9 = 15.<n>Therefore, 1960 = 29 x 1937 + 9 = 40<n>Therefore, 1980 = 36.4 x 1937 + 9 = 58<n><n>Input: A truck drives from A to B on a road running parallel to a river.

You accept the offer and agree to pay her $750.00 per year for the remaining 8 years of your term.  The price should be $0 because the car should last 8 years, but it should be $750.00 because of interest costs.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

It was overkill.  What did he shoot at? Choices:  A: body armor B: ungulate C: bomber D: kill people E: animal<n>Output:		 A: The body armor took four hits before it fell off B: The ungulate only took an extra hit or two C: The bomber was a total success D: The kill people was also a big hit<n><n>Input: A group of five people from a company, A, B, C, D, and E, had to spend two hours on a field trip to a large city.  Jim was in charge.  Jim had a map and a compass.  Jim estimated that the trip took two hours.  Jim estimated that each person used the compass in three of the four directions.  In short, Jim put the trip at 3 hours.  For Jim, 3 hour trip = 3 hours.  But for the other four people, it took 3+3+3=5 hours.  So how long did the trip take?<n>Output: Jim estimated two hours but when he used other methods he found that the trip took 4 hours.<n>He estimated that each person used just the compass in three of four directions and the map in the other three directions.  For Jim, it took 3+4+3=5 hours so his total time estimate was five hours.  For the other four people, the trip took 2+4+3=4 hours.  Thus it took 3+2+2=4+8, so the total travel time was 8 hours.<n>Thus, 3+4+3+3+3=6=8.<n><n>Input:The town you live in is divided into 16 districts.  Your favorite food is pizza.

Each house also has a phone line, a refrigerator, a stovepipe, a toilet, and a garbage bin.<n>So the total number of doors is 36.  In total, the total number of rooms per house is 12.  Thus the total number of houses are 16.<n>Thus, the total population of the district is 16,384.  In total, there are 60 houses in the district.<n>Thus, the district has a population of 20,640,000.<n>Since the district is divided into 16 districts, each house has a separate population.<n><n>Input:Three cars were parked at a gas station.  The first car had a driver, a front seat passenger, and a back seat

Withdrawing $6,500 in New York will be the same as withdrawing all of your money and going to New York!<n>So you need $12,500 in the account for the lawyer and $2,500 in New York.

The pilots have to decide if this will benefit them personally or their company.<n><n>Output:The pilots decide to pay $20.00 on each extra piece of luggage. But will that be enough to offset the weight in total? Weighing 5,000 pounds, the extra luggage will require 5,000 pounds of additional weight.<n>In total, that is 10,000 pounds of additional luggage for the 7 passengers and their attendant.<n>Each extra piece of luggage will cost the passengers $20.00. They have to decide if paying $20.00 is the best decision they can make for them in this situation. If it benefits them personally, they will pay the extra $20.00. But they must decide if it is the best decision for the company. If the extra expense outweighs the benefits the company will save in fuel and time it would take to get to the next airport, then the company will make less money and will not be able to fly as much because they had to wait for the 7 passengers to return. Each passenger gets a $1.

The bank is offering this new service to the majority of their customer base who request it as a means to fund their retirement.  How many of each of these will you need $70,000 to qualify for and are you asking someone who can’t access it to borrow more money?  In other words, what type of investor does she need $70k to participate in the program with?<n>Output: the program requires $70,000 in the bank account (in addition to an investment account).  Thus, each required individual will need $70,000 in cash ($10, 000 per person depending on their age) so that they can have a bank/investment account with the new service and thus be eligible for the program.<n>Assuming that no other requirements are met, then one person can buy $70,000 worth of goods or services each month and receive $10,000 in bonus payments from the bank for that month.<n>Since each individual will need $70k in cash (and not $50k) to participate in the program, each individual will need $50,000 worth of deposits each month in order to receive the bonus payments<n>Thus, if each individual takes $10,000 from their investment account at the end of each month and deposits it in their account, then each individual will need $15,000 per bank account ($2,000 per month minimum) to receive the bonuses.<n>Thus, the maximum monthly income from the program is $15,000 per person.<n>Since each month the bank will distribute $10,000 in bonuses ($3,000 each) to over 20,000 potential investors, then this means that the maximum monthly income from this program is $15, 000 per month.<n>Thus, the final answer is 20<n><n>Input:A new game has no end but each player only has a limited number of moves left during the allotted “turn”.

They raced a mile and a quarter which is the world’s fastest distance.  Then they ran a quarter mile which is the world‘s second fastest distance.<n>Then they ran a mile and a quarter in each of the last 2 races.  The length of the race is one mile plus 30 seconds.  The total time is four minutes and fifty eight seconds.  The total distance covered of the four mile and thirty three second race is four miles and eleven seconds.  This is the longest single track of all time.  The total distance traveled of the seven quarter mile races is five miles four and one half seconds.  In all, the total race is 7 miles and two seconds.<n>Each horse in this race covers the course one and one a half times.  So they covered the course 8 times in one night.  After running 7 miles and two seconds in the first race, they ran one and one and one half times in the second race.  Then, they ran three and four times in the third race.  Then, the last and 3rd race they ran was over 2 and a half times as much.  That is 24 miles two and a half seconds.  So the total distance covered over seven quarter mile races was 24 miles two and a one two quarters.  That is a distance that nobody thinks about to even think about winning.  It was very popular.  The winner was a colt named “American Fly.”<n>Each horse can only run one race at any time and there is a limit of one horse per person at any given time.  There are no double payments and there is an exacto knife included with each ticket.  There is only one betting window at a time with a maximum run total of $800 for each half mile.<n>And each round the bets are settled on the side of the track that the horse left the previous race.<n>The horses that won first, second, or third place were given the winner’s cheque and the horse that finished last was given a half cheque (i.e. $800) and last place was given one third cheque worth the total amount of the tickets that was written.

They may raise the electricity cost more and charge $1,000 if they do nothing: <<10,000*1=>>1,000,000<n>However they will save money and increase revenue if they start charging $250 a year for electricity.<n>They plan to buy additional power and the average revenue per guest has been $80,000.00 a year. Based on this forecast, they will charge $250.00 a year for electricity if they have 10% occupancy and $500.00 a year if they have 50% occupancy.<n>So their current annual revenue should be $125,000 (in constant dollars) if they just have 10% occupancy and they will have $500.00 if they have 50% occupied.<n>So their current yearly revenue will be $120,000 if they have 10% vacancy and they will have $900.00 if they have 55% filled.<n>Since they only have $10,000 in revenue, they should charge $10,000.00 a month for power and $25,000 a month for occupancy.<n><n>Input: A woman and her husband have a baby.

What is the best way to transport the apples to a town about 50 miles from the fair?<n>Output: The best way is to have a truck that is large enough to empty all the load onto one side of the road and unload onto the other.<n><n>If the apples are to be stacked on top of each other they must be on top of two piles of trees for them to be stacked.

The total time required to transport 1000 lbs. of apples to a town 150 miles from the fair is 2*9=120 hours.  Thus, 40 days in the barrel are spent transporting 1000 lbs. and 20 days on the way there are 80 days in the barrel.  The total time from start to finish is 120*80=360 hours.

Group A may be fighting another group and Group B may be fighting a third group.  So even though the primary method is combat some of the groups are fighting enemy groups or joining war against enemies.<n>In combat your goal is to win your battle and capture a flag, or to kill your opponent.  The question is whether you are in victory or death.<n>The question is how do you decide what battle to fight and how do you decide who you are fighting?<n>The answer to “How do you decide which battle to fight” is simple, you decide it, your troops do it.<n>So the answer to “Who do you fight?” is A, you attack the enemy you are fighting, you defend against anyone you fight.<n>But, you don't need to know what you are fighting because the enemy will decide what battle you are in and will select you to fight, if required.  So the answer to “What war do you want your troops to fight?” is the same, decide it, your troops will choose the battle.<n>So the answer, in some sense, is simple:<n>A – Conquest; B – Capture; C – Kill; D – Defend; E – Terrible<n>In war, your goal is to win battles and capture or kill the enemy.  The question isn't where to fight; the goal is where to fight.<n>The answer is the goal is either, A; B; C; D; or E, you have no choice.<n>Here, I have decided that you make the choices.  How do you decide?  You decide.<n>You don't win battles.  You advance and capture territories. In this case, it was to capture a flag.<n>You don't capture a flag. You fight against enemies that are in your war and in their war you fight. If you are in enemy territory, then you will fight with the enemy, if you are in their territory, then no.<n>You don't kill enemy people. You kill the enemy who will not retreat to the safe zone if fighting.<n><n>Input:You are in a room in which all the doors are open. You could decide to close all the doors, or you could decide to open some of the doors. The people that are in the room are: you, the boss, and the customers. The boss has given you

Choices:  A: university B: concert C: home D: terminal E: airport<n>Output:		 airport has no security<n>A university is known to accept foreign students and it has received criticism for failing to notify foreign students of visa requirements ahead of time.  University policy says that students must have a passport and a letter of invitation as proof of a valid visa to enter the U.S. so university officials have stated that it is responsible for the visa of all foreign students.  Given the university’s reputation for low security, what is the likelihood that the student who rented the apartment of a potential attacker will take these safety precautions seriously?<n>Output: There is no airport security at all because the airport operates as a private business and the owner decides what security precautions are necessary.<n>Concerts have had concerns that unruly performers and intoxicated patrons could attack the performers and guests at the event.  The venue’s security measures involve hiring additional security services and putting an extra layer of guards to patrol the venue.  This has caused concerns among concert attendees for security.  While there are some concerns about the extra cost, it also could mean better security for the concert.<n>Home security features include a burglar alarm and police reports.<n>Airport security features include a high level of security, including armed security officers or agents.  Other security features include a metal detector checkpoint to control access to the secure area.  While these security measures may be effective, the problem of security that would be associated with any one of these security features may be sufficient to deter the attacker.<n>Terminal security features include a baggage claim area that is patrolled by TSA officers.  Also, the boarding process includes a metal detector to ensure that checked bags are not carrying valuables.  These measures are effective.<n>Input: What have all the security measures that airports have provided?  (1) The response of a group of thieves is predictable.  Deterrence is the key feature of these security measures.  How can they be effective to deter a group of thieves? If a group of thieves steals from an airport in Los Angeles, even if the thief is apprehended, the group will often break through security and steal a lot more things.  Deterrence is therefore the key feature of airports.  (2) If the thief is apprehended, airports are willing to take a loss.  Therefore an airport’s security staff will be happy when the thief is apprehended.  That was one of the requirements of the airport security program in Los Angeles.  How is this strategy effective?  (3) It may be impossible to

They set up a plan so that they can start drilling for oil as soon as possible. The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms decides to hire a team of researchers to investigate whether there are any more unexploded bombs near places where oil drilling has occured. They find a place a long while ago and are about to excavate a bunch of oil from it when the scientist on the team is killed and goes missing. The team has to try to find the body of a dead scientist and the rest of the team has to go on their own search for the body. There are so many unexploded bombs and there is no way to get them all out. One of the researchers goes to an old storage room that has been abandoned since the war and finds a huge tank full of oil. The researcher opens the door to it and the oil runs out. They put the oil in a big tank and get the rest stored. The team heads out again and they find about half a million more barrels. The team has to work really fast and figure out a way to get the oil out of the tank as it is going to run out soon. They find that they need to go through an old tunnel and into an old mine for the oil to run out. It becomes really hot in there and takes a long time to get out the oil. Eventually, the oil runs out as well. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms sends another team of investigators. These people are really good at explosives. They try different ways to get more oil from the original oil well and they discover that they can drive the oil out of the old mines with dynamite.<n>Input: The government wants people to rent a car, buy a cheap, basic gasoline (or diesel, whatever gas there is in the US), and drive as much distance as they can.

The temperature was 55 degrees and relative humidity was 25%.  The wind created wind gusts of 33 mph that blew north of you at 15 miles in a direction directly across your face on a flat field.<n>Out of a field the wind speed and direction were 10 and 15 miles per hour.  The difference between these two wind velocities is 33 mph, or a 3.00 m/s squared.  On a flat flat field the speed of the wind will depend on the relative motion of surface to air and distance from the ground.  The relative motion of a flat floor or the ground to the horizontal is approximately 3.00 m/sec squared (8 times 12).<n>Out in the field the relative motion of an air mass is approximately 1.00 m/sec2 (4 times 14) so in theory, the wind speed and direction are 3.00+1.00+1.0+1.0 = 6.00 m/sec with a wind perpendicular to the ground.<n>Therefore, in the above situation, the actual wind speed and direction is 1.00 m/s3 so in theory, the actual wind speed, or force, is 1.00 m3.  Therefore, the above wind speed, or magnitude, is 1.00*10=30 mph.<n>If the wind were blowing at 20 m/s that would cause a force of 15 m/s squared but on your flat field the relative motion of the air mass is 12.00 m/sec so the force is actually 13 m3.

Choices:  A: thrift store B: bed C: shelf D: home E: toy store<n>Output:		 You buy a teddy bear for $10.00 at a thrift store.  The next best thing would be to go buy a stuffed animal from a bed,  home,  shelf, or toy store.  The next thing would be to go  to bed,  shelf or toy store and buy a stuffed toy.  The next thing after that would be to buy a bed, home, or  toy store teddy bear.  Then you would have a whole lot of choices!<n><n>Input: An aircraft takes off without its crew.  The pilot declares that he will make only one stop.  He is running late and decides to take an airplane to a different airport without the airplane crew.  What should his course be?<n>Output: He should be landing the airplane safely on the first attempt.  He must not make a second attempt but be landing on the first attempt.<n><n>Input: An engine loses power after just 150 miles of being in use.  The pilot decides he wants to return home to refuel and then try again.  If he returns home on one of these attempts, which one?<n>Output: The pilot was already running on one engine and would need to take a second attempt.<n>An attempt would cost more gasoline and thus have an affect to the price of gasoline.  Thus, the second attempt would be a loss in the first attempt.<n>The second attempt would also take longer to refuel the airplane compared to the first attempt.<n>Thus, the second attempt would result in a second loss in the first try.<n>So his second try would result in a second failure in the first try. Therefore the second attempt would be an unsuccessful attempt.<n>Thus his second turn would result in a second failed attempt. There would be one round about he could fail a second time but that is unlikely. Thus, the round about would yield a second loss in the second failed attempt.<n>So his second attempt would result in an unsuccessful attempt.<n><n>Input and Output:<n>Tiny Tim wants to go to Disney World.

Choices:  A: harder B: anguish C: bitterness D: tears E: sadness<n>Output:		 Before divorce the wife would have followed the instructions A: harder B: angst C: sorrow D: tears E: bitterness<n>The divorce is harder than the separation because of resentment for being the one that is doing the work all along.  It is also more painful.  So in general, she chose to do it and that is what should be on her conscience.  That is what hurt her.<n><n>Input: What percentage is the expected value of a single week of work?<n>Output: The work that she put into it was not expected.  So she lost out by being upset with the work that SHE did!<n>It is expected that when you put in the effort, the reward should be given!  So a gain of a week’s pay is NOT deserved!<n><n>Input: The wife and husband have a child together.  The wife says that if her child were to make a lot of money, it would be like having a “basket full”.  The husband thinks that a family is not made by the money that is made by the parents and the child; it’s made through the children.  What do you think?<n>Output: The children are the reason for the wealth of the parents and they are only a side benefit that should have no bearing on whether the parents have money or not.<n><n>Input: After the father died, the mother had two sons and one daughter with her.  The mother could have married the one who died if she wanted to.  So would she have changed and her three children still would have been?  The mother feels that she had to bring her children into the world and she was always happy that she had more than one to raise.  She loved them all equally and she has never regretted.  As such, I don’t think it bothers her if there are two children on each side of her because she considers them all her own!  Would she have changed if there were three or more?  I don’t know how she would feel about it.  You would have to ask her.<n>Output: No!<n><n>Input: If your car breaks down on the side of the road, do you call the help?  If you don’t call them, you can take it to the auto repair shop or have your friend bring it to a car-wash.  Or do you wait it out until the owner fixes it?  I’ve done all three!<n>

That is where the island is called Cajun Island.”<n>Bill says: “Yes but you can’t grow a marsh.  That’s all water.”  Bill says.  “Yes all you can grow is Cajun. Cajun is harvested from the marsh.”  Bill asks.  “But you can’t control its growth.  You can’t stop it from spreading.  It is in the marsh.”<n>The Cajun man explains: “Cajon is born where marsh plants start to grow.  Cajun can grow anywhere, where marsh plants grow, because marsh plants have no roots.

They then have to clean out the box for wood, sand and shine, making the wood shiny.  The next step for the roofer is to lay the tiling, the first 3 layers are typically ceramic or laminate tiles.  The tile is laid in a square pattern, and the tile setters use a scraper to clear any loose material out from the tiles before placing the tiles down. Once the tiles are placed on the floor, they need to be smoothed, to ensure smooth application.  The tiles must now be sanded, so the rough pieces can be removed without scratching the tiles.  The roofers finish by trimming excess dirt which is common to avoid leaving any small cuts on the tiles. Each day during their roofing job the roofers move a bit of the rough to allow for smooth application.<n><n>Input:During their roofing service, a roofer must move the debris out of the hole so that they can clean it and reuse the same hole later.  To clean the debris from the hole, the roofer takes a hand held device, which resembles a chisel, and rubs around the hole cutting up the debris.  To make sure the debris can be reused, they must allow the debris to dry for several days before being reused.  Since there is no way for them to make sure that the debris dries in time, they must sand the roof for a few days prior to using it again.  This sanding results in very rough tiles which have to be sanded before being reused.<n><n>Input:A man was working at the factory when his boss told him he could come to the office at night to work on an urgent job.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Price is decided on which shoe you will use most. Price is determined so that shoes at one price will always be the best because they are more likely to be used than the shoes at a lower price.  What is the total pair of shoes it costs to purchase 6 pairs?<n>Output: The total cost is $150.00+ =<<150+12>>12.<n>6 pairs of shoes total $150.00 and thus, 6*6=<<150+12>>6 pairs are purchased.<n>Each pair of shoes will be used 6*6=<<<6+12>>6 pairs of times for $150.00.<n>Thus, 6*6=<150+12>>6 shoes total $150.<n>Since each pair of shoes is purchased six times at $150.00, 6*6=$150+($$$50)/6 = $150+$150-$150-150, therefore 6*6=$0<n>Thus, 6*10 = <<<10+1200>>10 pairs are purchased<n>Each pair of shoes is 2*2=<<<10*2>10 times for $2.00<n>Thus, 2*2=<<10*2>2 pairs of shoes are purchased.<n><n>Output: Let’s take the number of pairs of shoes and divide it by the number of days the person will be staying at the house. Therefore, 6 shoes for 20 days is:<n>*60/20 = <<60/20>40 shoes<n>The total number of shoes for 20 days is (60/20) + (2*8)^40 = 40 shoes<n>Thus, 60/20=<<(2*80)*40>>40 shoes<n>Thus, 60*20=50 shoes<n>Since each $2 pair of shoes is only used twice, the total of the shoes purchased for this single night has been $150.<n>Thus, 50*20 = $150<n>Total of shoes purchased for this night have been $150<n>Thus, $150-$150=$150-$50<n>10 pairs of shoes = $180<n>Thus, $180-$180=$180-$40<n>20 pairs of shoes = $240<n>Thus, $240-$240=160<n>6 pairs of shoes = $350<n>Thus, $350-$350=<<60

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

Choices:  A: better job B: irritated C: feel safe D: save money E: headache<n>Output:		 The body guard’s work was good and he made the person who signed the contract do B, but not C or E, and also not E or D.<n>Each person is required to do A,B,C and D for 2 weeks each and that equals 14 days of work.<n>Each day will cost 1 hour and 30 minutes so he will need to drive 20 hours in 2 weeks to earn the same pay as working for 8 hours a day.<n>So the final result is 60 hours drive over 7 days at $900.00.<n>Now he is stuck between earning 2 hours each day at $1.50 or getting no compensation and giving in to his demands.<n>So the final input is 80<n><n>Input:The two brothers who are leasing the house together for the summer, they want to find a landscaper to help with mowing the lawn. They’ve decided that they will charge $75.00 per day per person. In the case of 4 people, that’s $1,000.00 per day. The house is big and there will be enough space to park the lawn mower so they anticipate that the mowing will take up most of the time that they’re there. After they hire their guy they’ll still need to find a landscaper so they’ll end up having to hire two. And then they need a house painter, so they’ll also have two people and will pay around $900.00 each for the three of them. Add to that one or both of them being seasonal and in an area where they expect the work will be tough and they’ll want to rent a place for those times where they’ll need an extra hand and they’ll need a couple thousand dollars worth of mowing work. What’s the total expected cost of the mowing at $1,000+?<n>Output: The exact cost is not going to be known until they hire the landscaper and have him turn his work over to two contractors.<n>Each person will have to complete two weeks of work for 2 weeks for a total of 6 weeks or 30 hours of daily work over 30 days<n>It means they will have 60 full days of work for a total of 90 hours of work over a 6-week period<n>This will lead to a total hourly rate of $160 or 9 hours work per day<n>So they will have to hire two contractors to cover the 40 hour work week<n>Since they

His freedom will be forfeit if he kills another person in the next year.<n>Also, the judge has already been aware of Jim's violent nature for a while and told Jim that if he didn't get his life back right now they would have him jump for joy.<n>So Jim’s life, freedom, and future now depend on two other people (the judge and him) not getting murdered.<n>So if he kills a third person after they all get their freedom back, Jim’s life will be forfeit.<n>So it's really not a good idea to go killing people.<n>So just keep being good.<n>So in summary when you decide on a plan you'll do A, B, C, E, and F, and remember to leave room for a plan D and if you want, leave room for plan E.

The company says for free usage if he pays their annual service fee of $750.  The annual fee is on top of his credit card.  How do the numbers add up?<n>Output: The annual fee is $2,000 and $750 is $75=<<75+75=110>>110 total.  So $750 pays for the annual fee and $750 is left over to pay for utilities and his credit card.

The smaller plane has 4 seats and the other plane has a lot of cargo for storage.  The smaller plane carries a cargo of food and the larger plane carries a cargo of medicine.  Both planes will use their left engines to help lift the cargo.  The smaller plane will fly to London, and the larger plane will fly to Sydney.  It takes 45 minutes to fly from Sydney to London, leaving a full fifteen minutes before the smaller plane arrives.  It takes 40 minutes to fly from London to Sydney, leaving a full twenty minutes before the larger plane arrives.  Based on their experience with the smaller airplane the smaller plane will take longer to get to land than the larger plane.   They estimated the distance to be equal to 3600 miles.  Based on their experiences with the larger airplane they estimated the distance to be equivalent to 4400 miles. Therefore, each airplane will take twice as long to land as the smaller plane.   They assumed that they could take advantage of the right engine to make up for their differences in endurance.  They estimated that if they had to take the time they have now the distance the small plane would take them would be 2200 miles.  If they were to fly at their normal speed the time would be about the same.<n><n>1. Which statement best describes your situation?<n>2. Which statement best describes the difference between planes?<n>3. If you are going to have to travel between Sydney and London at the same rate the size of the plane doesn’t matter, but the location and altitude do.<n>4. In this case how do you consider speed to be related to distance?<n>5. In this case the size of the plane matters a lot, but at what altitude is speed related to distance?<n>6. In this case the right engine would make the difference between being able to land and not being able to land.<n>7. In this case it might be a good idea to have passengers in the larger plane.  If they stay they might take them down the ramp.<n>8. This example might best be used when they are trying to carry some cargo and the cargo is smaller than the area they are trying to carry.  Then having them land in the smaller plane would be an easy, inexpensive way to go.

Choices:  A: violence B: falling down C: vomiting D: vomiting E: lower standards<n>Output:		 A or D is a likely outcome.  A common occurrence could be fighting or fighting with fists or knives.  Violent actions would be a possibility, so punching could be included.  However, most of the anger comes from drinking.  A drunk person who is angry and throws punches is likely to be kicked out.  If they choose to do that, they will probably be told to leave.  A “good loser” like Eric would probably get in trouble, but he wouldn’t get kicked out, because he was the person with the alcohol.  A drunk person might get drunk enough to pass out and then leave.  He might not have been drunk enough to begin with.<n>Choices C and E could be occurring.  They may be occurring because Eric is fighting with fists which cause him to fall (because he can’t stand) and vomits (because he drank to much).  This is a common occurrence in bars and pubs.  There is also vomiting after drinking too much, but there is a chance that it could be alcohol related.  A person who vomits after drinking may vomit several times.  It may be that they were the first to get drunk, so they were the first to vomit.  Some people vomit very easily like that, but they need to be careful not to vomit too much<n><n>Input:Who could tell the weather?

Then just ‘bake the sandwiches’,” said Mighty Joe.  “Then you could have them ready every 15 minutes after the order comes in.” said Jimmy.  “That’s much better.” remarked Mighty Joe, thinking about it.

The home had 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom or bathtub/shower, a kitchen, and dining room. It also had a balcony. They wanted to be near the water to get the exercise of fishing. By then they had sold their cars.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input:Joe bought a ficus.  He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n>Output:		 This is a tricky question.  This particular ficus would be a decoration with a view and in an area with a lot of trees.  So in all likelihood, it goes in the family room.<n>He’s paying $200 per cent per day or $3,400 per month to have “his forest” as his home.<n>Each day, he’ll be paying $50.00 and renting out his hair salon.<n>So the question is - How much would he pay for each day?<n>Output: $200 per cent/day or $7,200 per month.<n>Joe’s hair salon is charging $200 per day to keep it running for 7 months.<n>Thus, if each day he rents out his ficus is $200 that’s $2,200 per month.  The total cost of the 7 months of rent is $24,800.<n>So the final question is $24,800<n><n>Input: A company operates 2 mobile homes with 8 cabins at a campground near Philadelphia.  Joe’s father is a cabin maker so he needs help fixing up one of the modular homes. When he asks Joe if he can build a cabin, Joe says no. But when he asks the men who do the work, they say they can build it for only $1,500 and put in $200 for paint and carpentry.  The total cost is $5,000, all of which Joe’s father will be paying for.<n>Input: The company does an estimate that puts a price on Joe's father's time during the first and last months of the rental.  The company then runs a business plan and says it’s going to break even or will make an enough off of each of the men’s work to make the total cost be $3,000 if they buy 10 homes.<n>Output: Assuming that in each month a worker goes home and the cabins are all rented, Joe's father would break even or make $3,000 in total income per month.<n>Thus, if 10 cabins are rented as the business takes off, the total cost of the rental cabins is $3,000.<n>So the final result is $3,000<n><n>Input: A family wants to buy a vacation home on the coast.

It has 5 planes that it owns and an additional 10 aircraft it has rented out (for a total of 15 aircraft).  The aircraft in question is an Airbus.  The airplane is used for corporate trips.  The plane is owned by the company and rented out as a vacation spot.  The plane is rented for 5-days.  There is a cost to renting an aircraft (the cost is the same as the rental cost) but there are also other expenses included in the cost of renting the aircraft ($50.00 per hour) - i.e., fuel $150.00 per hour, insurance $400.00 per hour.<n>Output: The total cost of renting the aircraft is 6 $400.00<n>Thus, total cost of renting the planes is 6*100 = $400.00<n>If the rent was $100.00/day = $150.00/day, then the total cost of renting the airplanes is $150.00*5 = $600.00<n>Thus, the only difference between the average cost of renting one plane and the average cost of renting ten planes is $10/day.<n>So the final result is 6*10 = $1200.00<n>Now if you want to look at something from a different perspective, consider what the total cost of a vacation is compared to the average weekly pay for an airline pilot. Then, the cost of renting an airplane for the vacation will actually be less expensive than the cost of an airline pilot (since an airplane is more like a rental than a paycheck). Thus, if you think about it, you can see that one-way airplane flights and vacations actually make a lot more sense financially than flying across the continent for work and back again.<n><n>Input:A guy goes to his favorite casino in Vegas, NV to buy $6.00 worth of chips.

In Chicago, the temperature is 102, so how many degrees above that is it?<n>Output: The temperature in Chicago is 102, and it will be 103 in the shade. So as shown the weather in Chicago is hotter and Humidex is lower, so it’s 102+heat+humidities = 97.<n>It’s hotter and Humidex = 97, but it will be 102+heat+humidity = 103-82<n>So the final answer for Chicago is 102+heat+humidex = 97. (The error is actually greater than the error of -3, since the heat/humidity formula is -3/102)*2=2^2*2.<n>Thus, there is a 3-degrees error (3*101) and thus a final answer of 98. (Note: the number is not meant to correspond to the weather in Chicago. It is just a way to give a rough idea of temperature.)<n><n>Input: In order to increase his return on his investment, John decides to buy a new motorcycle in order to travel more often.

So the total of cost per year is 1/1000, which is $80,000.<n>Thus a 1500 acre horse farm will cost him $20,000 in maintenance and other fees and taxes. So, it’s only going to cost him $800 to raise a horse, but it also has 10,000 horses

The average speed   of a bus is 65 miles per hour.   The cows weigh 5,200 pounds and average 45 pounds each.    The farmer is charging $35.00 per day + $250 fee for this labor work.    The cow’s labor cost   is $350.  John is renting the property and  doesn't  have enough water or electricity to run two pumps.  He wants to build wells.  His property owner won’t give him these resources.    John rents for 4 days   is  $140.00 total.<n>Output: $140.00 + $250 = <<$140+$250=400>>400.00.<n>John is renting the property for $140.00 and  he has $140.00 of additional costs such as a well pump, electricity, pipes,  etc.  Thus, $140.00 +.50 = $150.  John is having to use up 20% of his $5,400 cost.  His total cost remains the same.  John is now at a loss and is  forced to sell the land.   The final answer is $14,400<n><n>Input: Two people are given 500 and 1000 dollars respectively and they must go around the world to find one that they like.

All people agree that they do not want to risk having one person decide to go to a certain country and ruin the reputation of that country.  The answers are:  A: China B: Cambodia C: South America D: England E: Spain.  The final answer is English.<n>

The question is how do you determine the “minimum need” for such a force?<n>Output: For a military offensive capability, it is not the number of fighter jets or helicopters that is relevant but their role. An offensive capability can be defined by distinguishing the role from a deterrent. Deterring by a strong ability to deny access to the other, is the role that fighter aircraft are needed for and deterring by the use of nuclear weapons is not needed. While nuclear weapons are used as a deterrence, an offensive capability can be a countermeasure in the event of the loss of a state's military supremacy. These factors give rise to the term “minimum need,” but it is not to be confused with the concept of “minimum requirements.”<n>For any military offensive capability, it will always be necessary to have forces larger than the number required to guarantee that no external state can deny access to the other<n><n>Input:The number of people who are unable to remember their birthdays on the date of the year they were born.

The CEO (the business owner) is concerned that the company could go under, since it is taking a significant amount of money off the business owner’s personal assets.  What is the CEO doing to help turn the business around?<n>Output: The CEO has hired an investment banker.  He has set up a $500,000 loan for the business.  He also has placed many people on loan/interest deferments so that they can afford to take their current positions which will likely have to be eliminated.  He has extended the life of the firm's lease by 15 years and reduced the mortgage interest on his home to a very low rate.  He has also begun to implement additional changes and has had his sales increase slightly.  He estimates that after all these changes, their sales will be on an even keel with 2006 levels.<n>So the final response to this question is A<n><n>In the following scenarios you were given the following clues:<n><n>input:The weather is nice in San Francisco.

Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n>Output:		 The ground is getting wet.  Your answer is B.<n>You are probably going to get dry skin, but you need to be careful as you are not supposed to be outside for 72 hours after showering so you won’t get dried out.  Also, the ground should be getting wet to a degree by now.  You will start getting dry skin as you do not shower for the required period.  Dry skin will not cause infection but it will start itching and the itchiness can be very uncomfortable.  Also, if you are going to stay out of the water a lot longer you should probably make sure that you are not going to be out there for more than 72 hours.  The question says 72 hours, so you should be there for at least that long.  I am going to say that you have gotten dry skin but you should not worry about it.  You will probably itch or itch a little to some degree, but it will not be the worst thing ever.  Do not worry about dry skin as it may not bother you too much.<n>The ground is getting wet.<n>So you are probably going to get a little bit of dry skin as you are not in water all the time.<n>My answer is D.  I have gotten dry skin, but it wasn’t that bad.  It would have been pretty bad had I been out there for a longer amount of time.<n>It does seem like you are going to be in some weather but it shouldn’t be that bad.<n>My answer is B.  You will probably get a little bit of wet skin as you aren’t going inside for a long period of time.  It will make you itch, but it should not be that bad.  You should be okay for the 8 days or so.<n>My answer is C.  You will probably be getting dry skin because you aren’t that long outside.<n>At least you won’t be dry skin.  Your skin usually sticks to the ground regardless of how dry it is.  If your skin sticks to the ground without wetting then you are good.  As always, you should be careful how long you are out in the water even if you are fine.  You have to be careful to keep from getting skin rash or you may develop some skin infections.  It’s also very important not to shower unless you are planning to shower again (more than the required amount of time) as even if you

They would need $1,000.01 to pay all their attorneys’ fees.  So, Chris and Chris filed for bankruptcy.  How much would they owe their attorneys?<n>Output: $1,000.  So Chris owes his attorneys $200.<n>It was 5 months later when Chris and Chris filed for their pre-nuptial agreements.  Chris’s pre-nuptial says $1,000,000.00, his pre-marital agreement with the same condition says $1,000. So his total debts are equal to $1,000,001.  So Chris owes $1,000,002 as his attorneys’ fees.<n>So $100,000.60 will cover Chris and Chris’s attorneys’ fees and they will need $200,000.60 to pay off their debts in the case.  After all debts are completely erased, they are left with $150,000.<n>So $150,000.60 will pay for Chris and Chris’ attorneys’ fees. So $150,000.00 is the final answer and $150,000.20 covers their attorneys’ fees and their debts are completed.<n>Input: The two boys were standing outside watching an old man fishing in the river beside them.

Joe says, "Now you get to use that money on a car instead," and hires John to fix Joe's car.  The two men meet at Joe's place and the job is getting started.  They start by measuring John's friend’s truck, but only have enough room for the pickup truck.  After removing the battery, though, they realize that he needs an auxiliary battery in order to drive his car, so they remove the auxiliary battery and replace it with a battery that fits in the pickup.  Once in the car, they start moving the car to its new location.  They get to Joe’s place and both men start the car, ready to drive it to Joe.  As soon as they take off, they note that their truck's battery appears to be running low.  Soon the battery runs flat, too.  So they remove their truck again, swap trucks, and drive down to Joe's house to replace the battery in his truck.  They then move the truck back up to the guy's house and start the process of moving it to his new home.  They eventually do it, though, and once in the house John decides that this is the one and only car that he wants to drive.  He says he’s now going to have a very hard time fitting the car into his new house.  So he spends the next two days looking for something to add to his current collection so that the car fits.  A family member recommends a used bicycle.  John has to look in his closet and go through every box of drawers in one of his rooms to find a used bicycle.  But he doesn’t give up easily.  He drives down to a bicycle shop and purchases a bicycle as a temporary solution.  He moves the bicycle back up to his house and starts working on trying to find something that will fit his new car.  He takes the car to a mechanic and asks for some guidance on how to finish re-fitting his car.  The mechanic has had a hard time figuring out how to re-fit a vehicle like the one that he needs

A week ago, he gave the old car, called Sally, away because it was in such bad shape. Then a few days later, he picked up a car, called Mike, and he hasn’t driven it much. Sally has a leak in the transmission and Mike has overheated twice – what happened with the transmission?<n>Output:  I don’t know, the question was very vague.  One possible reason that John gave as a good reason for selling Sally was that it “needed new rubber” because Mike overheated and broke the transmission.  Another possible reason was that Sally was unreliable and Mike needed a car that the previous owner had only driven a few times.  But he also could have mentioned the transmission repair cost, so what happened?<n><n>Input: What is the maximum speed that a boat can go? Choices:  D: 25 M: 30 M: 40M: 50<n>Output: What was the maximum speed that Sally could go, a week ago?  I think I have this right: Sally went 35 mph and had reached her maximum. When she traveled in 5th gear, there were no other cars present on the road. Now what??<n><n>Input and Response:<n>The “average speed” of the wind turbine will be 30 knots but wind speed varies widely as you continue up and down. The wind gust is typically in the range of 7 knots and increases as you move up windward. The gust will also increase as the wind continues to the right.  The speed will also vary as you sail on the wind and the wind moves in the direction of travel of the boat. There’s no way in hell to estimate the maximum speed of the wind turbine.  But I’d bet that it reaches between 18 and 20 knots.<n><n>Input:What difference is there between a person who has two cars and a person who has a car, a trailer hitch and a car?<n><n>Response:I think it depends on what you

How much is $20,000.<n>Output:Barry does not need to sell the farmhouse if he only needs $25,000.00 down to purchase a $100,000 house he can finish at $100,000, and make a yearly profit. He will pay $100,000 and make $125,000.  Barry will only lose $15,000 and make $100,000.<n><n>Input:The woman wants to rent out her town home.

The hoist raised cranes to an unusually high position and allowed for very intricate designs to be printed on the large sheets of paper.  Cranes were primarily used in the building and construction of skyscrapers through the 1960s.  Cranes are still used but are not as commonly used as they used to be.  Cranes are no longer in production in the United States because of the rise of computer printing.<n>Output:Horserounds are dogs that are used to pull wagons in Africa.  They are trained to bark and then lie motionless on the ground for hours.  When a waggoner pulls one, he will give a high frequency and a medium voltage sound wave of about 10Hz will be produced.  The waggoner then pulls and the noise is amplified and the waggoner will give a lower frequency and a low voltage sound wave of about 90Hz.  Thus, the horse is used to draw a wagon.

A train driver observes that the car is slowing down just before the stop sign.  Which action is the correct response? Output: The car must stop immediately at the stop sign, or there must be at least 2 seconds between the car’s action and the train’s action in order for the car to be able to stop.<n>If the train pulls away or if further actions are taken, the car need not stop at the stop sign.<n>However, if a train passes within ½ mile of the stop sign (or when cars are traveling under the train), then it must stop at the stop sign regardless of what actions was taken.<n>Since the train is moving at a high rate of speed, the car must proceed slowly enough, in order for the train’s actions to reduce the risk that the train could pass directly over the car.<n>Each car can slow down before or after its action; however, the second car can only slow down in front of one of its actions.<n>If there is at least a 2-second gap between the car’ s 2-second action and the train‘s action, then the car is required by the Federal Rule of Regulations to stop at the stop sign when the 1st car moves to a faster (or slower) speed than anticipated, in order for the car’s reaction time to be adequate.<n>If the train is moving directly over the second car, then there is little room for the driver to safely adjust its speed.<n>For these reasons, the train must change track or be halted by another train which is in motion.<n>The 3rd car must not be required to slow down, unless the 2-second delay was caused by the actions on the first 2 cars which were not required to slow down.<n>Since the train can move by itself until it can stop, the car’s 2-second delay no longer applies to the second car.<n>Since the 2-second delay applies only to the first car, the 1st car may proceed at a speed up (or slow down) to avoid the 2-second delay.<n>In this case, the driver of the 3rd car must make a decision as to whether to continue moving or to stop at the stop to avoid the safety hazard that the slowdown might cause.

He asks his wife to buy an old truck and drive over the bridge with him to pick up his neighbors’ cow.  He goes over the bridge and the truck stops in a ditch, the gas pedal is stuck.  There is an arrow pointing towards the ‘no vehicles’ sign on the bridge above him. He reaches down and puts his foot on the accelerator and, as he does so, the diesel engine comes on and the truck quickly goes airborne and crashes into some trees.  On impact it leaves a deep impression in the earth and destroys some of the trees.  The farmer, after recovering from his shock, asks his wife to get him his cows; she tells him she doesn’t have a pickup truck.  As the two of them walk on he tries to think of a way he can drive the cows across the bridge to safety, he gets the idea that their cows will need two people to lift them both.<n>Output: He goes to his wife’s house and asks her to get his pickup truck and drive them across the bridge; she tells him that she doesn’t want to leave him stranded in the middle of nowhere and suggests that he should try to get help from a neighbor.  She agrees to drive him, but does not want to drive over the bridge because once again the diesel engine comes on.<n>Once again a friend arrives and drives with the farmer over the bridge.  The accident leaves a large dent in the earth.  The farmer climbs out of the truck and goes over to inspect it and begins to examine and survey the damage.<n>He discovers that the water had seeped in from the ditch which caused the gas pedal to stick.  The engine has turned over in the center of the vehicle and a tremendous amount of water has filled the cab.  He jumps out, using the tree roots as leverage, and grabs the accelerator and slowly pulls the fuel filler

A,B,C,D,E,F (all letters of the alphabet) are the letters of the alphabet. On B,D,E,G,J,K,L (all letters of the capital letter), John has one piece of meat. On E,H,I,J,K,M (all letters of the lower case alphabet), John has two pieces of meat.<n>Input: John can’t afford $20 a head to move the herds to higher ground, so it would be cheaper to pay the rancher $30 per head of cattle. On the other hand, the rancher charges $190 for a week’s rental of his car and John wants him to move the livestock to the higher grounds for as-much-as-he-can-afford. A,B, C,D,E, F, J can be rearranged as follows. On E,E,G, J, Q, K, L, J, N, P (all letters of the alphabetic order), John has four pieces of meat. On H,I, J, K, M, N, R (all letters of the letters A-H-I-J) he has eight pieces of meat.<n>It took John 40 minutes to round up his herd. After 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 25 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes and 60 minutes he rounded up all 868-piece of meat (each one-piece being the same meat as the piece before, i.e. A is a piece of meat, so A is an eight piece of meat.)<n>So John had 40 minutes for 12 pieces of meat. So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 4 hours and 30 minutes.<n>For 4 hours and 30 minutes (4 pieces of meat each hour) John spent $50,000<n>Therefore the final answer is $50,000<n><n>Input: A storm is approaching New Orleans, and there are no stores left.

Outcome:<n>Output:<n><n>Input: A police department is trying to apprehend an armed robbery suspect.  They have no surveillance system, but they know it is not that hard to get a car to chase and intercept the suspect.  They also know the vehicle’s make and model number.  They are therefore not in a rush; they do not give chase and continue to follow and look for clues to the suspect.  A car that runs at high speeds is noticed by the suspect.  He has driven all the way to the police department.  He turns over a wallet containing 2 million dollars, a bag filled with cocaine, and a pistol.  He is apprehended shortly and has another 500,000 dollars in cash on his person and another $1 million in the wallet.  The police know that they have arrested the wrong person and demand restitution.  They argue that the suspect should be released so they can investigate further.  However, the suspect thinks the police have it out for him and that he will not get away with it. The suspect fights against their demands and the police finally decide to release him.  The suspect is arrested and imprisoned on several gun charges that he never knew he had.  The trial finally begins, and the suspect is found guilty on all counts.  The police find it very hard to believe that the criminal will ever admit to the crime and that he will take responsibility for giving the gun to the suspect.  The suspect is sent to the electric chair and executed with a gunshot wound to the head just to make sure.  The judge agrees that he has no choice in the matter.

Kennedy (Eddie G).  In 1992, President Bush was running for re-election, the Democratic candidate was running for President against him; Bill Clinton won by a tiny margin of 2,400 votes, or 1,000 votes per district in each district.

A police officer, who had witnessed the robbery, was accused of breaking both the patron’s nose and lip, and the officer was charged with criminal mischief and resisting arrest. The customer, however, suffered only minor injuries.  A federal district court dismissed the suit on the ground that the victim did not meet the requirements for a cause of action for personal injury under federal law, which makes it unlawful for a police officer, acting within the scope of his employment and under the circumstances of a particular case, to cause another to suffer a property injury, especially that “to deprive the Plaintiff of his or her fundamental economic interests in property without just cause.” In re Biscuit and Cheese, 621 F.2d 827 (3d Cir. 1981).  Based on this decision, if a police officer breaks the nose of a patron who assaults him and he injures the patron, the police officer in no way violated the Constitutional rights of either the patron or the officer, and the patron may bring a suit for damages against the cop. Accordingly, you have three questions:  1. Do the constitutional requirements for a cause of personal injury apply to a police officer who breaks something if a patron hits him?  2. Do police officers violate the Constitution if they hit a patron on the street who has never been accused

So they are asking each neighbor to bring $60 back in change to get the money back that was lost.  So the first month of $240, the first payment of $60, and the return on the money will be 60x90/3.<n>Output: So in the first month you will have 40 x $240 = $160.<n>The first payment will take 60$ /90 = 60$ so $60 x 20/90 = 60$. You will be paid $240 for the first day. Then in the next month your second payment will be 60$ x 90 = $60$. Then you will get paid 60$ + 60$ a month for the next two months, and 60$ for the next two months and 60$ for the remainder of your months.<n>So if all of that is $160, you have received a $480 payment in 2 months.<n>So your payment total will be $480 x 2 = $960.<n>Since each month you get paid $240 you will only have to pay for the 2 months for which you get paid. Plus you will get $480 over 2 months.<n>So, $320 minus $80 from paying the $240 for the 4.5 months, and $240 minus $40 from paying $240 for the 12.5 months, you will be left with a balance of $480 / 12.5 = $160.<n>So, $160 plus $240 gives you a $360 payment which is what the next owner of the land is asking. It means that the first day you get paid $240, you will also get paid $360 each month, so $240 or $360 in total.<n>So your payment is $720, then $720 minus $120 from paying for the 4.5 to 12.5 months, and you will have a total payment of $720 over 12.5 months.<n>From here you can divide that payment by 12 to find the square footage of the house. The square footage of your house is $1200, so your payment will be $240 per month. This gives you $720 per month. After 12.5 months you will have paid $720. So your payment is $720 per month or $720 x 12 to give you

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input:Where do you watch garbage? Choices:  A: television B: dumpster C: landfill D: fox news E: trashcan<n>Output:		 You must watch trash through a garbage bag because you won’t watch it otherwise.<n>So in order for you to watch “garbage”, we need to put a garbage bag over our heads, and close the windows.<n><n>Input: A group of doctors were searching Google for “the biggest mistake ever committed in an airplane accident”.  One doctor came up with the following: 2,500 passengers were killed in an airplane crash in 1979, but the pilot was found to be incompetent! How can you be sure?<n>Output: If the pilot was found incompetent, then this would be the second worst plane crash ever, right behind an airplane crash where 2,500 people were killed in 1985.<n>If the pilot was found to have crashed his plane without losing control, with two of them being killed who would that leave?<n>If the pilot was not incompetent, and crashed his plane without losing any lives, who might this leave?<n><n>Input: 2,500 passengers died when an airplane crashed in 1979.  The pilot said that there was no one to save them, so he didn’t want to pull the fire alarm.  He then said to the captain, “If there are 10 persons inside this building, then only 90-90 = 60-60=15%.  So if there were 90 people, then only 85-85 = 75-75=20%.  And if there are only 200 people, then only 105-105 = 60-60=10%.  So, in order for the pilot to save more lives, then 5% of the passengers had to die.  So if all 2,500 people died, then each of those would have to die exactly the same number of times as if there were 500.  That would leave 55-55=40.  So in order for the pilot’s words (“If there are 10 people inside this building, and I need to pull the fire alarm, then it should only be me and 5 others that need to be rescued right now”) to be correct, then we’d have to let 5, 100 people die before pulling the fire alarm.  Which method do you believe would be correct?<n>Output: If we let 5, 100 people be killed, then the result would be 50/50, so we’ve eliminated the method of “pulling the fire alarm”.  If the pilot was not a liar, we could eliminate that possibility

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n>Output:		 A beaver builds a structure to block a stream or river.  The beaver builds a series of towers made of logs, each topped with a different object.  These structures are lined with brushwood.  The beaver’s dams fill most of the water but a relatively shallow path leads through a natural water fall to the sea.  The natural spring can hold about half an acre of water.  When the spring dries up, the beavers move the logs from one side of the stream to the other.  The area above the beaver’s structures, which supports the river, has fallen away.<n>Input:  Bob wants to know the name (1) of the most famous beaver species.  Answer:  Beaver (1)<n>Input: Mary can’t remember the name of the Beaver family.  She gave the example of the Beaver family because it has a large number of members and some of them have been around for a long time.  What is the name of 2 or more beavers?  Answer:  Beaver and Woodpecker.  Also what is the name of a beaver from a wooded area which has been built upon?<n>Output:  The Beaver family is probably named after the two beavers (2) built this spring.  The family’s name was probably derived from one of two sources:  one being a historical group that lived in the area for 1,000 years.  The name was probably derived from the animals’ distinctive beady eyes.  The family”woodpecker” may have been derived from the animal’s distinctive call.  Mary, Mary, did you know that beavers live in a wooded valley?  And did you know many beaver dams build over water to protect fish?  The beavers build their dams to prevent animals from getting into their dams (birds and mammals).  This usually results in loss of some of the aquatic species that live near the dams.  Which family is one of the most endangered because of their dams?  Answer: Beaver.<n><n>Input:A couple wishes to build a swimming pool on their property, but must first remove an old water tower which is threatening to fall over on its own.

There are 16 possible moves, so there are 3 possibilities for each move – no more than 6 options can be made per move.<n><n>1. When you begin the game, you can make any number of moves. However, to make more than 4 moves in a row you must either choose a play or move by which you have chosen to make that move.<n>2. Every four moves a person must select either a play or move and may move in that selection (if a move is selected it must be played).<n>3. When you have played your first move, you must make a choice at that time. Do not play again until you’ve had a chance to check out the board (i.e., you cannot move) and have decided whether you will move first.<n>4. To move, you must roll a six sided die. If you have already spent one die it is difficult for you to move in the same turn.<n>5. At the beginning of each turn you make a single roll at the six sided die. If this roll is for the same type of move – i.e., for example you make your regular move 6 times in a row – it is difficult for you move in that turn.<n>6. The player who chooses the first play must not make any further plays until they make one of their own.<n>7. If a person does not make their first move they forfeit their turn to the next player.<n>8. Each player is allotted one turn to play any number of moves.<n>9. If a player chooses to forfeit their turn, they must choose a new option.<n>10. If you’ve already chosen a move, or if you’ve moved already, there is no point to re-choose!<n>11.

Is it important to ask for the stimulus package savings or a larger budget deficit reduction?  *The stimulus package savings should be the first priority for reducing the deficit.  Spending cuts will likely be required to reduce the deficit even after a sufficient number of stimulus payments are received to offset stimulus spending.  Cuts would be acceptable after stimulus money has been distributed to citizens for income tax benefits, child tax credit supplements, and other stimulus programs.  *An additional $11 billion in stimulus payments should be provided to those who have been forced to quit work due to layoffs by businesses impacted by the recession.  An additional $10 billion in stimulus payouts should be provided to businesses who have been forced to close their doors.  *The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains an additional $1 billion in funding for infrastructure programs.  This money will likely be used for local infrastructure costs, instead of stimulus monies.  The stimulus money received could be used for these additional infrastructure programs as well.  It is not clear whether this additional $1 billion will be used for stimulus monies or infrastructure grants

How much money does that move Jason ahead of schedule?<n>Output: $50,000<n>However, when Jason goes to pay the invoices, he finds the invoices are due for October 20, so that makes $75,000 of unpaid bills.  Of course, the second accountant now thinks he has to write one more check to Jason for that amount.  So that brings the total to $200,000.<n>Input: A man, Jim, asks Jason to lend him $10,000.  Before he does so, Jim checks up on the account and finds that Jason has only lent $300 to Jim for the last three years.

The cost to repair the car after it was damaged is $200.00. The dealer pays $50.00 per hour. What is the total cost of repairs?<n>Output: $200.00<n>At the factory they give you the amount of cost to repair and you take and subtract from what you are owed.  You subtract the cost of repairs from what you sold the car for and you come up with the selling price.<n>So the final amount of money that the dealer gets from you is $200.00<n><n>Input:There are three types of insurance coverage: property, business, and health.  There are three kinds of coverage for each.  The value that your employer or health insurance gives you is the value of your policy.  The amount that your premiums would pay out is the amount of your benefit.<n>Output: Property insurance = Property insurance pays out the value of your policy minus its cost.  Business insurance is the same thing as property.  You would have a liability insurance policy.  Health Insurance is the same thing as business.  You would have health insurance and a medical coverage.<n><n>Input:In California, a family member of the owner of the rental agency can request that the car’s insurance is changed. What does this mean?<n>Output: A: They can change the value of the insurance policy by paying for additional coverage.  The insurance company pays for the extra coverage and the new value is added to your rental car insurance policy. At the rental agency they would set the insurance limit at a number equal to the amount of money they expect to pay out and you would set your limit equal to that amount.  If the company is unable to send someone to talk to them about having their car’s insurance changed to avoid claims, they can call you.  You can tell them that you are willing to discuss this and you would like to change it.<n>B: They can have the car’s value increased at the rental agency.  The company pays for the increase and the new value is written onto the credit card provided to you by your rental agency.<n>C: They can sell the car for more money than the value that they paid.  Your rental agency does everything that they can think of so that the insurance company wouldn’t have to pay

The salary will also pay off your student loan and retirement.  Therefore, you will be in a position to be able to spend some time away from children, allowing you to work less and build up savings.  But before you can do that, you will have to work during the month when you make the minimum monthly payment and the balance is due, so if you don’t pay your student loan off each month it doesn’t get paid off until the next payment, when your salary is due.  You can always find ways of skipping a month.  But as long as the balance is paid off it is never late.  You can pay interest on the difference between the balance you owe and the minimum payment that must be paid each month.  At the end of each month you will have enough accumulated savings to pay your mortgage in full and your student loan and retirement in full.<n>Output: You will be able to retire at 25 because of the student loan and retirement.<n><n>Input: You have a job that pays an annual salary of $40,000. The mortgage payment is only $200.00 per month but you still have student loan payments and retirement to pay.  You take money out of your salary each month and invest that money in real estate.

C) Trying harder D) quitting E: winning or<n>getting fired (James wanted to quit the golf business for his own business which he didn’t want to do).<n>So it depends on your answer. I guess he felt pressure from some of the above, but he’s probably been trying harder than he has, but he’d rather quit than give up on his business<n><n>Solution: It depends on A. If he’s just trying harder (he has been trying harder), then it's pressure. If he wants to quit, then the pressure is death. If he wants a different job/way of working, then he should quit without pressure, as opposed to staying since he wants to quit. What James feels needs to be stressed out is that he should not quit.<n><n>If James is trying harder than he’s ever been before, that could be pressure. He should find a different business and go back to it but remember that if he keeps doing what he’s doing, he’s not going to succeed. Just because he says he will stop doesn’t mean he will. There’s still plenty of pressure on him because he didn’t know how much stronger he could get until today. He has to find a solution though: if he won’t work at least half as hard, he’s going to fail at least half the time. The only solution is to start doing more and getting better at what he’s working on now. If he didn’t quit, he would be giving up on something that he didn’t think he would ever be good at. The only way he can win is if he starts getting good.<n><n>If he quits, he will be less competitive and feel more pressure. He will need to find a new business for sure. Either at work or maybe he should quit, quit one business and start competing in another to get money to make the golf business work. Then when he finally quit the golf business, he won’t feel so good about quitting but he will be more competitive again. There won’t be pressure on him anymore but he still has to get better at golf or quit the golf business because he won’t be able to keep competing in different business. Quitting golf is not doing better. He will still feel bad about quitting his golf business. But if he doesn

Choices:  A: plain B: cold C: dull D: bad E: wet<n>Output:		 Clouds are not the same thing as a cloud. Some cloud formations are beautiful.  They can be the size of a city; very dark; often have sharp edges; and often are moving.  They can even have a specific shape like a cup shape or a disk shape.  For example the most popular cloud formation in the Northern Hemisphere is the cumulus and the most common in Europe and North America is the stratocumulus. Also, there are thousands of different things called clouds and the names vary with time and place.  Some clouds form near a mountain range and some are found in the ocean. Cloud formations can be organized or loose.<n>Cumulus cloud - A low layer formed by rain and snow particles which are suspended in the air. They are sometimes called snowflakes.  They are often seen around mountain peaks on clear, cold, or dry days.  They form as snow moves towards shore.  Cumulus clouds are not often seen in Texas.<n>Stratocumulus cloud - A tall layer created by the sun's rays or the sun's heat melting snow and ice.  Stratocumulus clouds are best seen in cold conditions when strong gusty winds are blowing.<n>Stratocums are not very popular in TX that much.<n>Cold cloud - A low layer, which is formed when the temperature is below freezing. There are many types of cloud depending on the temperature.  Some are deep, flat, or thin.<n>Plain cloud - A low layer which is formed from the sun’s rays or heat melting ice.<n>Plain clouds form near a mountain ridge and snow and ice fall freely.<n>Dull clouds – Low layer often formed after several days when the cold air cannot thaw and can also form on very cold nights.<n>Dull clouds can form when the sun is far away and too bright.<n>Wet cloud – Low layer form when the rain or snow is dripping down.<n>Wet clouds form after several days when the temperature is cool and the air can't conduct heat.<n>Wet clouds are not very common in the USA!<n><n>Input:What would a person say if they were being arrested for DUI?

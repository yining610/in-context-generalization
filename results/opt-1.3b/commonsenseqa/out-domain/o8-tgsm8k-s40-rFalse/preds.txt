At this point, the Green Solution was the largest project he had undertaken.  The next project was a water conservation system.  A system of pipes in and out of the classroom was designed to help transfer and reuse a significant amount of rainwater. It was designed to operate much like a well.  There is no water conservation system in place yet.  The only water being used is water from drinking wells.  The third project was a sewage treatment system for all the buildings. The entire campus is covered with sewage pipes.  This project was estimated to cost $1.5 million to complete in its current state.<n>Input: The first project was the water conservation system.

(x2) times a number will be a cube.  A cube can be thought of as the average of the number of cubes of a given number.  If the cube of any number is a number, the cube will be equal to the number of cubes.  In order to be equal, the cube of the same number must have been an equal cube as well.  x2 is equal to the integer 1.  As a result, there are infinitely many cubes equal to X2.  The cube of an odd number is always equal to the cube of the number odd one.  If the cube is an even cube, each number is equal to its cube. If an odd number is not a number, the cube of its cube is not equal.  A cube can also be thought of as the sum of the cubes of a number.  Since a number can be thought of as a sum of its cubes, if a number is a sum of its cubes, it must be equal to its cubes.  If we consider a cube, we can think of it as being a sort of ratio of cubes to number of different numbers of cubes.  In an ordinary setting, the number x2 is equal to one cube.  The figure for (x2) is shown below.  The figure is similar to the cube of (X), but is much smaller.<n>Input: 40<n>Output: 1<n><n>Input: The cube of an odd integer is larger than the cube of an even integer.

Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n>Output:		 A is right.  A clarinetist is rarely assigned to a concerto.  But, clarinetists are usually assigned to other roles.  A clarinet soloist is typically assigned to some sort of solo piece in the form of a large ensemble piece or individual concerto.<n>Output: C is right.  The instrument is selected for it's flexibility, portability and performance capability.<n>Input: E is right.  Sometimes, the instrument is placed in a role that is not a concerto, as a lead artist, as a bandleader, or as a soloist.  A trumpet soloist's main role is often assigned to a role in a large ensemble piece, such as a small orchestra.  And, some saxophonists don't just perform solo, and instead do more playing with a band.  This is especially true after a career of playing a solo piece for concert audiences, and many take a break from playing in public to join an ensemble.<n>Output: D is right.  It is very easy for musicians to be exposed to different types of gigs after a solid public playing career.<n>Output: A is correct.  The clarinetist is often assigned to various roles in orchestras, smaller ensembles, and concerts.<n>Output: B is correct.  After performing for many years with orchestras and smaller ensembles, clarinetists often take a break from playing for various reasons.  But, they return to the music business to play with other musicians again, in various groups, to perform in concerts, and as soloists, especially by jazz musicians who do not always perform soloists by the standards of classical music.<n><n>Input: A group of 100 students can play, “Somewhere in Time” in an outdoor setting for 20 minutes at their school for $50. The group of 50, “The Music Makers”, can play the piece for 10 minutes at a school for $20. Why is the second group’s cost $50 more?<n>Output: $40 is the lower cost.  The first group is a group of musicians with some degree of professional experience. They have played for schools and bands, and so, are considered to be professional performing musicians in that they make professional quality performances.  The second group is considered to be more amateur than the first group, because they only have music experiences in school, with no previous playing experience on an adult level for more than two minutes at a time.

They then had to use the fingers on only one hand to count up to 4.  After each count, they had to put their face back behind the calculator and repeat the process using the fingers on the other hand.  When done, the teacher counted in each hand how much work each student had done each day.  In addition, each day they had to count the number of days they had worked.  Finally, they had to show the professor how quickly the 4-days of work was done (using fingers), and then compared the students' work to the professor's.  The professor wrote the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 in blue ink on yellow paper and marked the days they had worked on each hand.  Then the two students in each class took turns explaining as much about their work as possible.  (To calculate the grade, the teacher calculated an average by multiplying the total day number of work divided by each student's day number of work.  The teacher divided the grade for each student by the total number of days the students worked on the hand.  This is the "average").  The teacher divided each student's average grade by the amount of work, then multiplied the result by the number of days and multiplied the result by the grade.  The average for the students and the professor's grade were combined together, and the difference was their respective marks on each hand.)<n>Output: 3<n><n>Input: The total number of days left in the school year is 9.

The average power generation by a generator is 15.75 kW (power is available 12 hours).  The average power generated by a gasoline-powered car is 39.1 kW (power is available 6 hours). The average output of a generator is 7 kW (power is available 3 hours). What is the most that a vehicle can charge in 6 hours?<n>Output: 22.35 kW<n><n>Response: (Click here)<n><n>Response: The average power generated by each car is 15.75 kW, the average power generated by a generator is 18.25 kW. So the average capacity of both the electricity and gasoline motors is 14.5 kW, when they both produce 18.25 kW.<n><n>Response: How many times can a wind turbine make electricity with 24 hours supply?<n>Response: 1,200 times.<n><n>Response: The most energy a solar panel can generate in one day is 10,000 kWh. However, by its own design, a panel generates 10,000 kWh per second.  How many times would a solar panel charge an electric vehicle in one day?<n>Response: 64 times more times than an EV can charge its battery. EV can only get 8,000 kWh for one charge. With the solar panel you can get 10,000kWh/h. EV can only get 1,500kWh/h. Solar panel can charge 20% more than EV can charge.<n>Response: The average electric motor draws 12 KW over its rated power. So the total energy that will be drawn is 6 KW/hour. Solar panel can charge the EV motor in 5 hours. So if it can charge in 6 hours, then the solar panel will need 12 KW-hourly.<n>Response: The typical length of a car on sale is 500 KW.  That means that in 6 hours on sale that car will require 2 KW per hour of charging: 6 per hour from the 12 kWh charge. What is the average capacity of 1 car on sale?<n>Response: 1.2 KWP per hour.<n><n>Response: Every gallon of gasoline used in the next year generates the equivalent of 2.75 million KWh of electrical power. So the average amount of energy that will be available from the gasoline used in the next 12 months is 30,

The scientists were able to predict from their measurements that one team would die from exposure to the harsh northern winter conditions. The ice scientists found that because of the high concentrations of sulfur from ice, ice would dissolve in about half an hour.  The polar scientists found that the ice would freeze to ice twice as quickly and become solid in about half an hour, but because some of the ice had been frozen over years ago, could not be used to measure the conditions and temperatures.  Scientists found that the scientists could use the frozen ice to measure the amount of greenhouse gases being released by the Earth, but not which ones.  The ocean researchers found that the freezing of the sea ice could have major effects on the water temperature off shore. The scientists said that most of the warming of the world from sea ice melting, might be happening in a long-term cycle of global warming with a gradual increase in ice temperatures. The oceans warmed up by 2°C because of the melting of the sea ice. The scientists said that because of the warming, the oceans had become much more susceptible to disease and bacterial diseases. The scientists also said that the melting of the sea-ice could cause many problems, but mostly by disturbing the balance of the earth’s climate.<n>Output: B<n><n>Input: A doctor is caring for a patient who has a fever of 102 degrees.

You are flying with Delta Airlines using the airline check-in kiosks.  At a security checkpoint you see a uniformed security officer checking each passenger's boarding pass.  Your boarding pass contains your name and boarding pass number so when he scans it you can see right away if he has your name or not.  On seeing your boarding pass number, he writes it on the boarding pass and places your boarding pass in his pocket.  After waiting 10 seconds he scans it again.  The passenger in line behind you, however, has a boarding pass that's handwritten on paper by another security officer.  As the security officer takes it from the pocket of your carry-on, the passenger behind you calls out, saying, "Are you in line yet?"  The security officer replies, "Yes, sir."  The passenger behind you replies, "I'm sorry! I saw your name when the officer scanning the board first brought my boarding pass out.  That's why I asked.  I didn't know if you had a boarding pass for our flight."  The security officer replies again, "Yes, sir.  It's fine."  And he scans your boarding pass.  If the pass has the same name as you, you're on the next flight.  If the pass is different than yours, you must go to an agent at the airline ticket counter to make sure the person on line was indeed your boarding pass before you board.  You go to the ticket counter, tell the agent the name of the passenger in line, and she gives you a boarding pass with your boarding information.  However, instead of your boarding pass with your name on it, the agent gives you a boarding pass that has your boarding information on it but which says, "Name unknown."  You're still allowed to board the airplane with this passenger even though he's boarded on a different flight.  You notice this because you have been called the names you've told the security officer.  The only way to find out if the passengers is yours is to ask a passenger on the plane with your boarding pass.  This passenger finds out your name from the passenger in line, the ticket agent who gave you the boarding pass, the name on your boarding pass, and the security officer.  Since the boarding pass says, "Name unknown," who did you board?  What if you are already on the plane?  You

That one is hard since its hard to come up with a good answer. The other one is actually pretty simple. There are many things we can do from home that are more efficient than going out into the rain.<n><n>#2 is the better answer, but #3 is harder than the other one since it requires you to take into account the fact that we cannot control what happens outside. We can only control what happens within.<n><n>The other one is only hard if you are bad at math. Or if you are only using fractions to determine how much rain fell.<n><n>The two most important things to do outside when you are outside are:<n>1. Stay dry<n>2. Stay inside when its cloudy<n><n>#2 & #3 is harder than #1. Its just hard since it requires you to factor in the external/internal world when deciding where we should be.<n><n>Here is what you will do:<n>1. The weather will affect when you go outside, which will affect the amount of work you need to do. The more rain you have had, the more you need to do inside. We need to see 2 out of 3 examples to make the point. If it is sunny, outside work is easier, if it is cloudy outside, outside work is harder.<n>2. We will decide where we should be when we are outside, which will affect our choices. The more rain you had, the more likely we are to go outside. The less rain, the more likely we will stay inside.<n>3. We will compare the two work times, and base the choice of where to go off those times. If we had to go outside, we will look at the amount of time it took to work inside. If we had to stay inside, we will look at how long it took to work outside.<n><n>This is the best answer. 1 can be solved with 3/2. 2 can be solved with 4/3. 3 can be solved with 11/10. 4 can be solved with 22/40.<n><n># 2 can be solved by 1, which is an integer.<n># 3 can be solved by A/12 since it includes the external

This made it even more impossible to plant strawberries and she tried to plant nothing but strawberries for 10 years but after ten years she was getting tired of growing strawberries and she began planting nothing but strawberries.  She decided to plant tomatoes, which grew beautifully.  Then she planted some cabbages so that she could eat vegetables with her meals.  Three years later she planted beans and one year ago she planted lettuce, and next year she planted radishes, peas, and zucchini.  When she saw all of these plants growing she said to herself, “this is where God has planted me.”  She became so happy that she never thought twice about growing food again.  But one day after she finished working on a strawberry patch she went to collect her tomatoes and she saw a tomato bush that had been harvested only two weeks ago.  Her heart sank.  When she came back to the strawberry patch she discovered some of her strawberries had grown into beautiful bush of strawberries.  She became so depressed and went into the house and cried for several hours until she thought about how beautiful the bush of strawberries looked.  She decided to harvest all of her harvest on her birthday and celebrate.  So she went out on her farm to harvest her strawberries and began eating some of the strawberries she had harvested and she was so happy that she looked at her strawberry bush and realized that her happiness came from the food that she created instead of from the harvest she gathered herself.  The happiness came from the food she created instead of from what God gave her.<n>The word for happy is: joy.(2)<n><n>input: In one of the cities, there were ten buildings with names such as ‘King of Kings’, ‘Lord of Lords’, ‘Prince of Princes,’ etc

It would be harder to drive if you were the victim in a D car accident and getting hurt would hurt even worse.  F car accident is better because it is much safer.<n>Output:  G car accident is worse than D car accident. Being hit by the car would hurt much more than just having the car run into you.  G car accident is harder to drive if you are the victim.<n>Output:  H car accident is just as bad as D car accident, but H car accident would have happened to someone rather than to you.<n>Output:  I crash is about the same as C crash, because you can stop yourself from crashing a car.  I crash is very dangerous.<n>Output:  J crash is just as bad as A car crash because you have to be much more careful in A car crash than you could be in a J

Where is the artillery center of operations?<n>Output: White House<n><n>In-house training<n>The Army also sponsors two-week in-house training for troops before deploying to war.  A typical two-week training course is split into five sections, taught in small groups, each containing 200 or 300 soldiers.  The training is intensive to help soldiers gain important technical knowledge so they can perform at their best. This process is called technical training and may consist of individual workshops or a few classroom exercises.  The entire course can last more than a month.  During the 2 weeks in-house training the soldier undergoes the course's requirements for military intelligence, operations and communications.  Following the course, the soldiers are moved to a permanent camp where they receive additional training from military instructors.<n>Training in-house often takes place at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. Other Army regiments that conduct such training include 1st Cavalry Division and 1st Infantry Division.  More in-house training activities are performed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.  Each year the Army holds an exercise in which soldiers learn how to perform emergency preparedness.<n><n>In-house Training Exercise<n>An annual exercise is the Army's largest training event. Known as Exercise Anaconda, it includes 40,000 troops from all four branches of the military on 30,000 acres (12,000 square miles) of former Rocky Mountain mining camp land in Glacier National Park.  The exercise has been held four times since 1985, and has been the Army's largest training exercise since 1985. Exercise Anaconda consists of six separate phases, each requiring approximately one-thousand of a soldier's time. The exercise usually lasts for about three weeks, and consists of multiple phases to simulate multiple combat operations. Most of the exercises in exercise Anaconda are simulated combat operations, but occasionally live soldiers participate as well.<n>Training exercises at Fort Leavenworth take place during three separate periods

Choices:  A: stress B: debate C: argument D: winning or losing E: tension<n>Output:		 They could fight, but who would win that fight? It’s a tough choice. Probably they’d both lose.<n><n>NOTE: If the answer to this question is yes, then you guessed the correct answer, and your choice is correct only if the answer to Question #1 is yes.<n><n>NOTE: In the first 4 questions the winner might get some sort of a trophy for getting the correct answer, but the 5th and 6th answers are a tie. In the last 5 questions, the winner of a possible 1st place prize is required to give 50% of it to the 4th place winner, so we will award 3 points for the first place winner and 2 points for the 2nd place winner and 1 point for the 3rd place winner.<n><n>In the first 4 questions, when 1st place is announced for any one of the answers, that answer gets a bonus point for 1st place.

Winner gets a bonus point for a 1st place answer, but that bonus point is subtracted from the 1st place answer’s subtraction grade for the whole program (minus the first score for the question or assignment). So in those 5th and 6th questions, the winner’s total points depend only on the answer’s score on the entire quiz.<n><n>In the 7th and 8th questions, there are a few possible solutions. The first and third answers both involve increasing the number of participants for the program, and the second and fifth answers involve increasing the number of questions per participant. Both of these solutions assume that at least 3 contestants are necessary to reach the goal. There is also a 4th possible solution, but the number of questions that would have to be answered is not considered large enough to warrant consideration.<n><n>In the last one, increasing the number of participants is possible, but the number of groups of participants would have to be large enough for even the additional participants to be necessary, plus the students might have to make such a choice that they would not be attending the next quiz.

There are millions of families who have lost their jobs.  Millions of small businesses have failed.

People feel that we should get back to a certain level of prosperity and hope for a better future. Now, we in the white house do not have the authority to end this war.

The coach has an interview with each boy to ask them what they like to do.  When asked, one of the boys says "I like to play with other boys."  When asked what he likes to do, the other boy says, "I like to play on the street."  The coach immediately takes off running to find him for a round-robin game.  One time the coach finds him in an alley, not far from his house.  When the coach returns to the boys, there's no boy there.  He asks them again, and there it is.  There's no boy.  The coach leaves immediately and gives his other three players the prize of the game.  When they all get home, the boys tell the coach he's an idiot.  The coach gets even angrier, thinking that it only took 5 questions to find him but 3 on his team to find the boy.  One more time, he calls every boy he knows to see if they heard the interview and was curious to hear what the boy really likes to do.  He goes to get a list of names from everyone he knows.  He calls back and the entire team is there together.  They agree it's the most important question they've ever heard.  The coach says, "We found him.  He's a boy.  I can hardly wait for you to see him."  The team gathers and comes in.  Now for the twist:  the coach calls each boy a name as he comes through the door.  He is shocked and disgusted that none of his team heard the question, and the other players can't hide their surprise because they're in the same room with him.  When the boys get out of the room, everyone laughs.  When he gets back to this house, the boy tells the coach, he only likes to play on the street and he has never heard the coach say that kind of thing about any of his teammates.  He asks if that's really true, and the boy responds with a laugh that says, "What a jerk of a coach!"<n>Output: A<n>The other answer for the correct answer is D<n><n>Input: There are 6 people under 18 living in one house.

(There is one sentence on page 60, the answer should be right in front of it!)<n><n>Comments :<n><n>The more we read science- fiction, the closer it seems it would become reality as well. The more often a movie is shown, the greater our fear seems to increase. The more often the story moves closer to reality, the more we start to notice its similarities. In the story the main characters do not die in an instant. We realize that the main protagonists do live through many events in their lifes.<n><n>The answer is D. The main characters in the story do not die in an in a instant. They do not have a quick death, either when the story is still in the beginning or when the story reaches its climax. When they start to die, the reader knows it is their will that prevents it. They do not just die, but they are pulled into a state with a great death. That is why they are so sad when they realise that their character will not die. A normal death is much more painful and shocking than a sudden death. We can all imagine a scene where the main character is about to die. That is not the same thing.<n><n>You may have noticed that there is no question mark in the answer. It is a very common question in exams, and it is almost always answered in a negative way. To be fair the answer is D; after all the main characters do not suffer in a quick death like in any other story.<n><n>Comments :<n>To be fair, it is a very common question. I am guessing the professor gives it to many students. If the students were to write other answers, the answers would probably have a question mark in the answer box. Students don't answer questions with negative comments. So, the choice is clear.<n><n>You may still be confused on why this question is on "S" questions. There is a reason: "S" questions are usually the hardest in an exam. This is because no one expects a "S" question to be so good. There is a test in your brain that goes through this exam for some

This depends almost entirely on the percentage of lean body mass that makes up the two people at the same weight.  What is the probability that there will be 20 pounds less in 5 years?<n>B:  if Brian weighs 20 pounds and Charlie weighs 20 pounds at age 60, they will weigh 10 pounds at age 40.  This is the probability that Charlie will be one pound at age 40 regardless of what Brian is doing or how he eats.<n>C:  if Brian is 25 pounds and Charlie has 20 pounds, they will weigh 4 pounds at age 60.  This is the chance that Brian will be three pounds (one less than Charlie) at age 60.<n>D:  the probability that Brian will be four pounds is 1/5 of the probability that Charlie is four pounds.  This occurs because at age 60 Charlie will have 10 percent of the lean body mass of Brian.  At age 16 Brian will have 10 percent of Charlie's lean body mass.<n>E:  Charlie must weigh 25 pounds if he wants to be the same height.  He must weigh a pound less if he wants to be 10 pounds lighter.  As we have already seen, Charlie is twice as old as this.<n>F: the probability that Charlie weighs 25 pounds and Brian weighs 25 pounds is 1/50.  Since Charlie is twice as old, Brian is a tenth of the chance of being 2 lbs heavier.<n>G:  the probability of Charlie weighs 25 pounds andBrian weighs 25 pounds is 1 in 5.  Since Charlie is the average age of those two people at that age range, this is the same chance as G.<n>H:  if Charlie was born on Christmas Day and Brian was on Christmas Eve, his birth date would be January 7th and Brian's date of birth would be January 6th.  These two events are always simultaneous so this cannot possibly change the birth date.<n>I:  if Charlie was 10 years old and Brian was born in May, they would weigh 13 pounds when they were the same age.  It is more likely that Charlie will weigh 13 pounds since he is half his age.<n>J:  the probability that Charlie will weigh 50 pounds is 1/2 of the probability that Brian will weigh 50 pounds.  Because Charlie will weigh 50 pounds more, he will be three-

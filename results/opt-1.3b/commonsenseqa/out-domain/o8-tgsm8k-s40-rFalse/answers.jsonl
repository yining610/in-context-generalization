(x2) times a number will be a cube.  A cube can be thought of as the average of the number of cubes of a given number.  If the cube of any number is a number, the cube will be equal to the number of cubes.  In order to be equal, the cube of the same number must have been an equal cube as well.  x2 is equal to the integer 1.  As a result, there are infinitely many cubes equal to X2.  The cube of an odd number is always equal to the cube of the number odd one.  If the cube is an even cube, each number is equal to its cube. If an odd number is not a number, the cube of its cube is not equal.  A cube can also be thought of as the sum of the cubes of a number.  Since a number can be thought of as a sum of its cubes, if a number is a sum of its cubes, it must be equal to its cubes.  If we consider a cube, we can think of it as being a sort of ratio of cubes to number of different numbers of cubes.  In an ordinary setting, the number x2 is equal to one cube.  The figure for (x2) is shown below.

The school supplies need to be kept at a cool or below-free-air-conditioning temperature.\n2.  The school supplies cost much less than the classroom supplies because the students use school supplies far less often than adult students do.  The classroom supplies, on the other hand, require frequent changing and thus last substantially longer.  The school supplies also cost considerably less than the classroom supplies when used at the same grade level, because the classroom supplies are so much heavier.\n3.

The average power generation by a generator is 15.75 kW (power is available 12 hours).  The average power generated by a gasoline-powered car is 39.1 kW (power is available 6 hours). The average output of a generator is 7 kW (power is available 3 hours). What is the most that a vehicle can charge in 6 hours?\nOutput: 22.35 kW\n\nResponse: (Click here)\n\nResponse: The average power generated by each car is 15.75 kW, the average power generated by a generator is 18.25 kW.

However, by its own design, a panel generates 10,000 kWh per second.  How many times would a solar panel charge an electric vehicle in one day?\nResponse: 64 times more times than an EV can charge its battery. EV can only get 8,000 kWh for one charge. With the solar panel you can get 10,000kWh/h. EV can only get 1,500kWh/h. Solar panel can charge 20% more than EV can charge.\nResponse: The average electric motor draws 12 KW over its rated power. So the total energy that will be drawn is 6 KW/hour. Solar panel can charge the EV motor in 5 hours. So if it can charge in 6 hours, then the solar panel will need 12 KW-hourly.\nResponse: The typical length of a car on sale is 500 KW.  That means that in 6 hours on sale that car will require 2 KW per hour of charging: 6 per hour from the 12 kWh charge. What is the average capacity of 1 car on sale?\nResponse: 1.2 KWP per hour.\n\nResponse: Every gallon of gasoline used in the next year generates the equivalent of 2.75 million KWh of electrical power.

The scientists were able to predict from their measurements that one team would die from exposure to the harsh northern winter conditions. The ice scientists found that because of the high concentrations of sulfur from ice, ice would dissolve in about half an hour.  The polar scientists found that the ice would freeze to ice twice as quickly and become solid in about half an hour, but because some of the ice had been frozen over years ago, could not be used to measure the conditions and temperatures.  Scientists found that the scientists could use the frozen ice to measure the amount of greenhouse gases being released by the Earth, but not which ones.  The ocean researchers found that the freezing of the sea ice could have major effects on the water temperature off shore. The scientists said that most of the warming of the world from sea ice melting, might be happening in a long-term cycle of global warming with a gradual increase in ice temperatures. The oceans warmed up by 2\u00b0C because of the melting of the sea ice. The scientists said that because of the warming, the oceans had become much more susceptible to disease and bacterial diseases. The scientists also said that the melting of the sea-ice could cause many problems, but mostly by disturbing the balance of the earth\u2019s climate.\nOutput: B\n\nInput: A doctor is caring for a patient who has a fever of 102 degrees.

{"text": "a\n\nInput: You have a very large purse.  What is your current carry-on size?  You are flying with Delta Airlines using the airline check-in kiosks.  At a security checkpoint you see a uniformed security officer checking each passenger's boarding pass.  Your boarding pass contains your name and boarding pass number so when he scans it you can see right away if he has your name or not.  On seeing your boarding pass number, he writes it on the boarding pass and places your boarding pass in his pocket.  After waiting 10 seconds he scans it again.  The passenger in line behind you, however, has a boarding pass that's handwritten on paper by another security officer.  As the security officer takes it from the pocket of your carry-on, the passenger behind you calls out, saying, \"Are you in line yet?\"  The security officer replies, \"Yes, sir.\"  The passenger behind you replies, \"I'm sorry! I saw your name when the officer scanning the board first brought my boarding pass out.  That's why I asked.  I didn't know if you had a boarding pass for our flight.\"  The security officer replies again, \"Yes, sir.  It's fine.\"  And he scans your boarding pass.  If the pass has the same name as you, you're on the next flight.  If the pass is different than yours, you must go to an agent at the airline ticket counter to make sure the person on line was indeed your boarding pass before you board.  You go to the ticket counter, tell the agent the name of the passenger in line, and she gives you a boarding pass with your boarding information.  However, instead of your boarding pass with your name on it, the agent gives you a boarding pass that has your boarding information on it but which says, \"Name unknown.\"  You're still allowed to board the airplane with this passenger even though he's boarded on a different flight.  You notice this because you have been called the names you've told the security officer.  The only way to find out if the passengers is yours is to ask a passenger on the plane with your boarding pass.  This passenger finds out your name from the passenger in line, the ticket agent who gave you the boarding pass, the name on your boarding pass, and the security officer.  Since the boarding pass says, \"Name unknown,\" who did you board?  What if you are already on the plane?  You", "answer": "B: generous"}

That one is hard since its hard to come up with a good answer. The other one is actually pretty simple. There are many things we can do from home that are more efficient than going out into the rain.\n\n#2 is the better answer, but #3 is harder than the other one since it requires you to take into account the fact that we cannot control what happens outside. We can only control what happens within.\n\nThe other one is only hard if you are bad at math. Or if you are only using fractions to determine how much rain fell.\n\nThe two most important things to do outside when you are outside are:\n1. Stay dry\n2. Stay inside when its cloudy\n\n#2 & #3 is harder than #1. Its just hard since it requires you to factor in the external/internal world when deciding where we should be.\n\nHere is what you will do:\n1. The weather will affect when you go outside, which will affect the amount of work you need to do. The more rain you have had, the more you need to do inside. We need to see 2 out of 3 examples to make the point. If it is sunny, outside work is easier, if it is cloudy outside, outside work is harder.\n2. We will decide where we should be when we are outside, which will affect our choices. The more rain you had, the more likely we are to go outside. The less rain, the more likely we will stay inside.\n3. We will compare the two work times, and base the choice of where to go off those times. If we had to go outside, we will look at the amount of time it took to work inside. If we had to stay inside, we will look at how long it took to work outside.\n\nThis is the best answer. 1 can be solved with 3/2. 2 can be solved with 4/3. 3 can be solved with 11/10. 4 can be solved with 22/40.\n\n# 2 can be solved by 1, which is an integer.\n# 3 can be solved by A/12 since it includes the external", "answer": "C: architect"}

Where is the artillery center of operations?\nOutput: White House\n\nIn-house training\nThe Army also sponsors two-week in-house training for troops before deploying to war.  A typical two-week training course is split into five sections, taught in small groups, each containing 200 or 300 soldiers.  The training is intensive to help soldiers gain important technical knowledge so they can perform at their best. This process is called technical training and may consist of individual workshops or a few classroom exercises.  The entire course can last more than a month.  During the 2 weeks in-house training the soldier undergoes the course's requirements for military intelligence, operations and communications.  Following the course, the soldiers are moved to a permanent camp where they receive additional training from military instructors.\nTraining in-house often takes place at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. Other Army regiments that conduct such training include 1st Cavalry Division and 1st Infantry Division.  More in-house training activities are performed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.  Each year the Army holds an exercise in which soldiers learn how to perform emergency preparedness.\n\nIn-house Training Exercise\nAn annual exercise is the Army's largest training event. Known as Exercise Anaconda, it includes 40,000 troops from all four branches of the military on 30,000 acres (12,000 square miles) of former Rocky Mountain mining camp land in Glacier National Park.  The exercise has been held four times since 1985, and has been the Army's largest training exercise since 1985. Exercise Anaconda consists of six separate phases, each requiring approximately one-thousand of a soldier's time. The exercise usually lasts for about three weeks, and consists of multiple phases to simulate multiple combat operations. Most of the exercises in exercise Anaconda are simulated combat operations, but occasionally live soldiers participate as well.\nTraining exercises at Fort Leavenworth take place during three separate periods", "answer": "A: neighbor's house"}

When asked, one of the boys says \"I like to play with other boys.\"  When asked what he likes to do, the other boy says, \"I like to play on the street.\"  The coach immediately takes off running to find him for a round-robin game.  One time the coach finds him in an alley, not far from his house.  When the coach returns to the boys, there's no boy there.  He asks them again, and there it is.  There's no boy.  The coach leaves immediately and gives his other three players the prize of the game.  When they all get home, the boys tell the coach he's an idiot.  The coach gets even angrier, thinking that it only took 5 questions to find him but 3 on his team to find the boy.  One more time, he calls every boy he knows to see if they heard the interview and was curious to hear what the boy really likes to do.  He goes to get a list of names from everyone he knows.  He calls back and the entire team is there together.  They agree it's the most important question they've ever heard.  The coach says, \"We found him.  He's a boy.

{"text": "A\n\nCommentary:\n\n(This is a discussion on the passage. I think it is a good question)\n\nAnswer : The more we read science-fiction, the closer it seems to becoming the reality. The more often a film is shown, the more we realize how real it is. The more the story moves closer to fact, the greater our fear becomes. (There is one sentence on page 60, the answer should be right in front of it!)\n\nComments :\n\nThe more we read science- fiction, the closer it seems it would become reality as well. The more often a movie is shown, the greater our fear seems to increase. The more often the story moves closer to reality, the more we start to notice its similarities. In the story the main characters do not die in an instant. We realize that the main protagonists do live through many events in their lifes.\n\nThe answer is D. The main characters in the story do not die in an in a instant. They do not have a quick death, either when the story is still in the beginning or when the story reaches its climax. When they start to die, the reader knows it is their will that prevents it. They do not just die, but they are pulled into a state with a great death. That is why they are so sad when they realise that their character will not die. A normal death is much more painful and shocking than a sudden death. We can all imagine a scene where the main character is about to die. That is not the same thing.\n\nYou may have noticed that there is no question mark in the answer. It is a very common question in exams, and it is almost always answered in a negative way. To be fair the answer is D; after all the main characters do not suffer in a quick death like in any other story.\n\nComments :\nTo be fair, it is a very common question. I am guessing the professor gives it to many students. If the students were to write other answers, the answers would probably have a question mark in the answer box. Students don't answer questions with negative comments. So, the choice is clear.\n\nYou may still be confused on why this question is on \"S\" questions. There is a reason: \"S\" questions are usually the hardest in an exam. This is because no one expects a \"S\" question to be so good. There is a test in your brain that goes through this exam for some", "answer": "C: mass hysteria"}

This depends almost entirely on the percentage of lean body mass that makes up the two people at the same weight.  What is the probability that there will be 20 pounds less in 5 years?\nB:  if Brian weighs 20 pounds and Charlie weighs 20 pounds at age 60, they will weigh 10 pounds at age 40.  This is the probability that Charlie will be one pound at age 40 regardless of what Brian is doing or how he eats.\nC:  if Brian is 25 pounds and Charlie has 20 pounds, they will weigh 4 pounds at age 60.  This is the chance that Brian will be three pounds (one less than Charlie) at age 60.\nD:  the probability that Brian will be four pounds is 1/5 of the probability that Charlie is four pounds.  This occurs because at age 60 Charlie will have 10 percent of the lean body mass of Brian.  At age 16 Brian will have 10 percent of Charlie's lean body mass.\nE:  Charlie must weigh 25 pounds if he wants to be the same height.  He must weigh a pound less if he wants to be 10 pounds lighter.  As we have already seen, Charlie is twice as old as this.\nF: the probability that Charlie weighs 25 pounds and Brian weighs 25 pounds is 1/50.  Since Charlie is twice as old, Brian is a tenth of the chance of being 2 lbs heavier.\nG:  the probability of Charlie weighs 25 pounds andBrian weighs 25 pounds is 1 in 5.

It is more likely that Charlie will weigh 13 pounds since he is half his age.\nJ:  the probability that Charlie will weigh 50 pounds is 1/2 of the probability that Brian will weigh 50 pounds.

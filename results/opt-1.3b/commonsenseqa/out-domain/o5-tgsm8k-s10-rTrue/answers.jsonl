In 1980, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a public water treatment plant and water supply had to be built. How many people have died due to water contaminated by sewage?\nOutput: For every person that died because of contaminated water there were 32 people who died from drinking un-filtered water.\nSo the death toll is 32\nFor the number of people for whom contaminated water is a danger, how did that number change from 1980 to 1999?\nOutput: In 1980 the federal government spent $2.5 billion on preventing water contamination. By 1999 the spending was $3.4 billion\nSo there is a difference of about $1 billion.\n\nInput:The city police department has 1,000 officers. You are given an estimate of how many cases will be solved each year over a 12-month period. You have to use the above cost and estimate to calculate the number of unsolved cases. Your final answer:\nOutput:Based on the cost estimate, it takes 1 case per officer per year to cover the expenses.\nSo a 24-month period would cost $1.8 million for police service. The budget for solving cases in that period is $4 million. So that is about $1.6 million per year. That makes for a total of $6 million.\nSo the true percentage of unsolved cases is 636% of the estimate. That means that 636 cases of crime will not be solved per year.\nSince 636% of that will not be solved, that equals 600 murders. Therefore 600 * 60 = 2400 people murdered each year. That equates to a total of 12 years of murder victims.\nSince the murder rate was so high, the FBI reported a 50% increase in deaths for the year 1998. In 2000 the murder rate was 36.7%.\nSo 600 x 36.7 = 1,200 people murdered per year. That equates  to 1 person dying from murder each day.\nThe total cost for the 636 unsolved cases is $20,000,000.\nHow much money the city pays per year for murder victims is, therefore, $20,000", "answer": "D: beach"}

{"text": "It's a relative proximity sensor.

If it had to be on the other side of the room how would you get it that close?\nOutput: It may not be possible to get it close enough to hit something if it is on your other shoulder. So an alternate solution is to have it next to an object, but that won't work since you may have to run around the room or get close to the object before it emits an alarm. So an alternate solution may be to try to have it on the table, but that won't help because that will take up the entire table.\nOutput: If it is attached to your clothing as a wrist or back attachment that you can put next to your body, you could then use that attachment to hold the remote and use the sensor to find it on the table.

By 1970, more than 40% of all men in the country worked outside the home; this number had risen to 50% by 1980.  As a result, there were more fathers than mothers than ever before, and women were less successful at maintaining their role as primary caretakers of children.  Because of the large number of new mothers, many of whom were illiterate, the Soviet population started to move to villages for work.  Women made only 1/3 of the money they had been making in the cities.  They had to rely more on the government for child care aid, and the economy suffered because people found it more difficult to afford clothing and food.\n\nOutput:The new policy was that each mother would receive 400 grams of", "answer": "D: heal"}

{"text": "He felt himself breathing again\nSo this was not an accident\nSo the final answer was A\n\nInput: A patient has a heart attack.   When she is first admitted to the hospital, her body produces 4 units of white blood cells per minute. This number increases as the illness progresses \u2013 her white blood cells are now producing 24 units of blood per minute.  When the patient is admitted into intensive care, her white blood cells are still producing 8 units of blood per minute \u2013 2 units less than before.  What happens to the patient who has had a heart attack?\nOutput: When the patient's body produces less than the 6 units that it did before, the patient's blood volume is reduced.  With less blood volume, she tends to need more intravenous fluids (to restore her blood volume) and other medications to maintain her blood volume.\nTherefore, the patient who has been in the hospital for 8 hours receives 7.5 units less of intravenous fluids than before she was in the hospital\nThis means that the patient received approximately 7.5 units less overall fluids, and that her death has resulted in approximately 100% of her body being starved of fluids\n\nInput: A group has 50 participants who eat nothing for 7 days prior to the test.

A solution is found to eliminate poverty in one part of the world by doubling the area of the country that is affected - so poverty is eliminated in two ways.  The first way is to increase the area by doubling the population, which doubles the number of deaths but also doubles the suffering of the people that suffer. Second, a new invention allows one to live a longer and healthier life by increasing  the frequency of eating a certain meal.\nSo in the world as a whole a solution is found that increases the number of deaths, but reduces the suffering of the poor by raising the frequency of the meal that gives the richest people more life.\nBecause of this solution, the number of global deaths decreases, and so increases the happiness of the people living in the country.\nAs a result the world becomes a more positive place.\nSo a solution to poverty is found that reduces the number of deaths while increasing the number of people.\n\nInput:John\u2019s job pays $22,000 a year.

Do they have to share the reservation or can they order separate items?  If they have to share the order, how many times do they have to split a reservation?  If they order separate items how many times do they need to split the order?\nOutput: Two people sharing a reservation are less likely to split a reservation because they would have to pay an extra $1 for a dish each time; if one of them orders separate dishes, the extra $1 must be paid twice; if the other orders separately it will cause an additional dish each time; then if the second person wishes to order more than the first, it will cost the second person an extra $2 to do so; so the total cost could be up to six times the original reservation fee. With no extra cost the first person will eat his meal and the second person will eat his meal. If the second person is still hungry an hour later, the first person must eat something else.\nOutput: There are many options for people to choose to order separate items. If people are not willing to pay for the extra things ordered one can only split a reservation twice.\n\nInput: The following list contains all the food available at each restaurant in Portland, with estimated times of when the restaurants will be open tomorrow.

For example, Singapore has 1.06 * 7.1 = 5.67 times the number of people in the US.\nInput: Let's suppose that most of the world's citizens reside in one country, the US (population 3.5 billion people); with roughly  567 million people in New Jersey. Now suppose that  10% of the world's population live in another country, New Jersey; with 4.6 * 2.5 = 9.2 million people in the US. What is the biggest discrepancy between the number of US people and the number of New Jersey citizens? This is important because the US is our country.\nInput: There is a discrepancy of 567 million people.  So, if our population is 567 million, then New Jersey, with population 4.6 * 2,55 = 12.2 million, is the smallest country in the world, and there are more New Jersey citizens than there are US citizens, so there is no discrepancy.\nInput: A man needs a lot of money to buy property.

It is a choice between options that would otherwise be equivalent.\nA proffesional player means a player who is at the highest level in his country. A winning tennis player means one who win matches.\nA victory is simply taking the ball, stopping, and returning it to your opponent under your own power.\nIf one of these options gives you a greater opportunity to win, it is the winning option. Similarly if the other two are in greater demand, the player is choosing the less demand option.\nIf, on the other hand, the choice of the less demand option provides an increased chance of winning, it is the winning choice.\nFinally there is simply being tired.

{"text": "D: europe B: hotel C: hotel E: palace\nSo which of the three choices makes more sense?\n\nInput:A man sells a house for $1000, he must know that the market is low. A man buys the same house for $1000 and the next day the other house sells for $800 less than the first, how much more money will the man make?\nOutput:He will make $800 more than the house sold for.\nSo the final difference between the price of the first and second house is $800 which a man will need at the end of the year, he will spend $800 on himself.\nSo the final result will be $800 more than the first house sold.\nTherefore the final price difference will be the difference is the money bought the new house.\nSo the final price of a house that was sold for $1000 should be $800 but the owner will buy it at the end of the month at $800.\nSo the conclusion is\n$800/868=$800\n= $800\nSo he made $800 the month before hand when the price of the first house was $1000.\nSo the new house is worth $800 and will sell for $800 the next month when it comes on the market.\nSo the final profit for him the month after the new house is $800 or $800+(1.3).\nSo the profit is $800/(1.3)=$800+(1.3)=$1066.\nSo the answer is\n$1066/(1.3)= $1066\n= $1066\nSo he made $1066 the month before when he bought the first house at a price of $1000.\nso he made $1066 more the month after the new $1000 house came on the market when the price of the $1000 house was $800.\nThe only logical outcome is that the man did not make money on the $1000 house before hand but will end up making money with the $800 houses.\nSo the man ended up making $1066 the month after the $1000 houses came on the market.\nA $1000 profit is therefore $1000\nSo a total profit of $1000\nSo a net profit of $500\nSo the net profit for the month was $500 and total profit was $1000\nSo the net profit margin for the month is positive or even 0\nSo the only reasonable conclusion is that the second house sold for $", "answer": "B: big house"}

The conversation ends with the salesman complaining about how his sales don't come in as much as he'd like. A: his approach B: his product C: the customer D: his approach D: his product C: his personality E: his product E: his personality\nOutput: the salesman is not happy with how his sales are going.  He feels his sales aren't what he would like them to be.  His solution is to: take a second phone call; work on his sales.  The sales man also decides to make a change in his approach in the future.\nInput: a salesperson is required to speak on the phone as much as she must.

For the cost of a new car to be equal to the cost of an older car, it must be bought one year later than the cost of your older car, and must be registered one year after your older car.  However, buying after one year is not the best time to buy in terms of depreciation. For a new luxury car to be the same as buying before one year, there must be a 50% difference in the cost of the new car and the old one.  However, a 50% gain in depreciation rates can be achieved by buying a new car at $5,000 and replacing the same car at $10,000.  If the depreciation rates remain at 50% as long as the cost of a new luxury car is the same as after one year, you are better off by waiting one year to buy. If the depreciation rate increases by 50% between the two cars, the new car may depreciate faster than the one-year return on the old value, despite having more miles on it.  Therefore, you should buy your car one year after the market has corrected itself and before you see any major changes in the depreciation rates.\n\nInput: The time from the time a person buys a home to paying them off is 3 years. What percentage of that time will the person be paying off their new home?\nOutput: You can buy after one year. If you buy after one year, you get 1 year to pay it off.\nIf you buy after one year you get two years to pay it off\nIf you buy after two years, you get 3 years to pay it off.  If you buy after 4 years, you get 5 years to pay it off..\nSo for the first 10 years, you will save $5,000 by buying after one year, and you will save $3,750 over 10 years.\nThen you can make up the difference between the two years by having it paid off when the interest rate is", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

{"text": "You will find a lizard on the beach if you speak Spanish\n\nInput: I bought a 50-pack of batteries. The cost per battery will range from $8-$13. After taking into account the cost of the batteries in dollars, how much would I have paid?\nOutput: The range of how much batteries cost dollars may vary depending on factors such as manufacturer, model, and price.  For instance, an iPhone box containing three AAA-style AA batteries may cost more than a battery that contains only three CR123 batteries. If the price per battery of a 50-pack is $8, it may be less than the cost of $8 for a pair of CR123 batteries, despite the fact that the cost per battery would be higher on the battery that came with the iPhone box (included in the cost of the 50-pack). If the price per battery is $13, then the cost of the battery included in the 50-pack will be equal to the cost of batteries included in the 50-packs you buy separately.  Therefore, it wouldn't make a difference to calculate the cost per battery of a 50 pack compared to a 50-pack of single, independent batteries, unless the battery included in each 50-pack was noticeably cheaper than the batteries included in other 100-packs. If the $8 battery included in the iPhone box cost $11, then one battery included in each 100-pack must be significantly more costly than the battery included in the 10-pack, because a 100-pack of batteries would be cheaper than 10-packs of single-battery batteries.  As long as the battery included in a 50-pack is significantly cheaper than the battery included in a 100-pack of single-battery items, then the cost of individual batteries included in a 100-piece bundle ($12), such as in the iPhone box, does not have an impact (assuming that individual-battery bundles include the price of individual batteries and the price of the iPhone box).\n\nInput: You receive $6,000 from John.

However, just a week into the experiment, the researchers learned the horse died, it had not been cured, or it was not effective enough.\nThe researchers blamed themselves, but when all was said and done the blame was placed squarely on the horses: Because the scientists made the mistake of allowing the horse and the disease to be so close together. The scientists could have prevented the horse from becoming sick. They could have prevented the horse and the disease from being so close to each other. Instead, the scientists made the decision to allow the disease and the horse to live so close to each other the disease was able to spread. So they now thought that the disease had spread and the", "answer": "E: cure"}

How much was the produce sold for?\nOutput: The average price of apples sold in a state that is not California is $0.0515. The average amount of produce sold in California is $.1806. Therefore, the produce sold for $0.1806 is $80-$0.0515 or $380-320.

In a large complex system such as a society where large numbers of people are involved, statistics show that if there are large numbers of individuals involved a large number of things can happen to the system. When the system becomes more complex or more sophisticated they start adding more complexities such as how individuals within it have varying roles in the system such as athletes or managers. In simple systems the number of variables can be reduced to the most reasonable number. In more complex systems they reduce the number of variables until they get to a level where they have as few variables as possible. The Law of Large Numbers states that there is a limit to how many variables can be introduced to the system and still maintain a semblance of predictability. When you have too many variables you are going to be much more variable than when you only have a few variables and there are fewer variables. The more variables that are introduced in a process the more variables there are that cannot be predicted and therefore can cause events to happen that are not predictable. In a society there are more variables that are introduced and there are more ways to change the process in the system as time goes on and things change. If a simple system were to meet a more complex system it would only get worse and worse in the process.\n\nThe point about a more complex system being harder to predict is because more variables have to be introduced so that the more complex system can continue to run. The more complex system has a different number of variables, however even after the number of variables is increased they may still not be as numerous as when they begin.

If he eats 500 calories worth of food, what's his total daily caloric intake?\nThe typical person puts about 1000 calories of food into their bodies.\nA typical person spends the rest of his time on activities that make him feel better, rather than activities that make him feel \"better\" but also require substantial amounts of calories to accomplish.\nIn other words, he puts 500 calories worth of food into his body and uses the rest of his day trying to achieve the same result.\nYou asked a question that had three answers and four alternatives, and when put in this way you're going to get the wrong answer for A and B, and possibly the wrong answer for D.\nA person's daily caloric intake should be based on the average caloric intake of the average person in their age group.\nIf he spends his day doing things that make him feel better rather than things that make him feel \"worse\", then the answer to the question is a lot lower than it should be.\n\nInput: The average amount of time spent on each activity is a measure of the amount of time you are wasting.

{"text": "your mind is asleep. You can't think\nIf you wake up, your mind will come back to you. If a person's brain needs more time to wake up, it can wake up with difficulty, like breathing problems. Or even if you don't wake up, you'll come back to yourself, you're just awake a bit later\n\nInput: If you eat a spoonful of peanut butter and then close your eyes, how long will it take you to fall asleep?\nOutput: When you close your eyes, you already fell asleep. Your brain needs more time to fall asleep, but if you make the process easier on yourself, you can fall asleep sooner.\n\nInput:A and B can not be combined, but they can be. If you eat A then B + B is the same as eating both A + B. If you eat a spoon full of peanut butter and then eat B, then eat a spoonful of peanut butter and eat C, and then a spoonful of PB, it will be A + B + C + PB + C + C + PB + A + A + C = AE\nOutput: When you eat A + B it is just A - A + A - A. But if A + B and A + C are the same, then eating them in order is A + A + B + C\nSo A + B is AE = AE = AE = AE ^2\nOutput: When you are eating A and C and eating B, it's already too late to get B since B is already too late. Eating A and C and eating C plus A will make A AE. So you're eating double. And a double means double equals the same as a triple, so it is AE = AE^2\n\nInput: The average length of a straight line is 12.2 meters.

So the line can't go from the end to the center. The line can't go straight from the point of the straight edge, it only can go straight from the end to the other end, so the line ends in a square.

Each tank holds 4 kg.  Suppose you fill the first tank only and then fill the second, third, and fourth tanks.  How much water do you have left in the second tank?\nOutput:It only holds 2.44 kg.\nSo it\u2019s only possible to take 6.44*4=18.44 kg from the tank that is filled with 9*9 kg.  If you also fill the tank with 10*10 kg, it gets to 4.33 kg.  That\u2019s less than 5%.\nBut you didn\u2019t fill every tank to the lowest size (3.33 kg).  It only holds 3.33 kg.\nSo there\u2019s a lot more water left.  So how much water do you get from each tank.  It\u2019s only possible for the second tank because of the difference in density.\nSo the total water from all four tanks is only 4.44 kg.  That means the total water you got is 8.44 kg.\nYou will have more water left in the first tank compared to the other tanks.  Also more water will be in the second tank than in the first.\nSo the total amount of water in the tank is 4.44 kg*2 = 14.46 kg\nSo your total water is 7.46 kg.\n\nInput:The mass of the universe is 1/10^(-2) m^3^3; that is, 1/10^(-5) kg^3; that is 1/10^(0)m^3^3\nOutput:How much space does the universe take up in kilometers?\nInput:Suppose it takes", "answer": "C: open boxes"}

{"text": "D) waterboat  All humans are powered by water.  Each person can carry two other humans, or they can carry only themselves.  So we are not talking about humans, but the water they are using.  The surface of the water is what it is called because it is a surface.  Since it is a water surface, it goes by a name that also applies to its composition.  So we call it \u201cwater\u201d and \u201cwater moving through a canal\u201d.  The name \u201cwater\u201d was made so that it would be easy for us to think about the water.  So the water can take the name \u201ccanal\u201d, which is a shortening of \u201cchannel\u201d.  \u201cWater\u201d is the name we give to the water.  So there is a difference between the names \u201ccanal\u201c and \u201cwater\u201c.\nSo \u201cwater\u201d is very useful both to humans and to water.  I have heard a lot of people talking about \u201cwater\u201c, but I have not heard much about \u201cwater\u201d talking about itself.\nSo \u201ccanal\u2030\u201d and \u201cWater\u201d are very good terms and have become very common terms.\nThe important word here is \u201cvery\u201d.  What we are asking is: Can one person carry two other humans on \u201cconveyor belt\u201d.  So I ask: Is it possible to carry two other people on \u201cconveyance belt\u201d, but only one person up or down the \u201cconveyor\nbelt\u201d?  So I ask: Are we able to \u201cconvey a group of people down a canal?\u201d\nSo I ask: Are \u201ccanals\u201d, or even \u201ccanibals\u201d, possible?  Can people be \u201cconveyed by the canal?  That is, can people be \u201cconvealed\u201d?\nSo I ask: Can conveyors be \u201cconveyor belts?\u201d  That is, can conveyors be \u201cbelt conveyors\u201d?\nOne person could convey two other people on the conveyor belt.  That would make the conveyor\nbelt conveyor conveyors (conveyor belts can be conveyors of conveyor belts).  I ask: So could the conveyor conveyors be \u201ctransplanters", "answer": "E: row boat"}

One kilogram of nuts cost $12 and one kilo cost $8.  How much did his purchases forn cost?  Output: For the nuts Adam, paid $<<3*12<<36>>36.  He also paid $<<2.5 * $8 <<2.5*8<<20>>20.  For the dried fruit Adam paid $<<2.50*0.5*0.5 = $<<2.50>>0.5*0,45<-$2.50 and dried fruit, paid $<<2.00<-$2.00>>0.5* 0.5 = $ <<2.00>>0,15<-$0.50.  Therefore his purchases cost $36, $40 and $38 respectively.  Therefore, from the total, for the nuts Adam and the dried fruit Adam paid 36 + $40 = $36 + $38\nSo in total for their purchases their total cost was $38 - $36 = $36.  Therefore, from their total, for the nuts and dried fruit, their total cost was $36, 36 + $38 = $36.  That means the total for the nuts and the dried fruit was $36.  So their total cost was $56.\nOutput: For the snacks, James, got an extra tank to refill the tank. It used to cost $20 to refill the tank. He got an extra tank for double the fuel capacity.

Therefore, the cost of filling the tank increased $40 from $20 to $40  (that is $40*20=$160^24=$160^64).  From the total, cost of the fuel was $160 ($40*40, $40*20) = $160.

The first bridge is made of wood.  The other bridge is made of steel.  Each bridge costs $15,000.  How did the city spend its $15,000 on two bridges?\nInput: The bridge made of wood was repaired and restored in 2006 at an average price of $150 and a cost of $120 for the steel bridge. Thus the total cost of the bridge repair and restoration was $320. The total cost of the bridge is $320 * 5 = $240.\nOutput: $240 x 5 = $2450\nThus the total cost of the maintenance, repair and restoration of the first bridge is $2450\nThat means that the total cost of the first bridge repair and restoration was more than the total cost of construction of the second bridge, so the bridge was not a cost-effective investment\n\nInput: On which month in which Year was the lowest rainfall?\nOutput: In 2006, the city got 578 mm of rain.

{"text": "A: bathroom B: cupboard C: surface of earth\nSo there is a stale smell coming from the bathroom\nSo the answer to question A is B\n\nInput: The volume of air needed by 50 people to blow their noses at the same time is equal to the volume of air needed by 5 men to blow their noses at a normal time. The solution:  The volume of air needed for 5 men to blow their nose at a normal time is equal to the number of men that would blow their noses at the normal time. This, multiplied by all of the nose blowing needs of each, gives the number of men that are working normally. So the solution to question 1 is 5.\nInput: To blow your nose, each person takes a breath, one after the other. In order for a person to blow a normal amount of air, the total surface area of the person's nostrils must be the same as that of the air being blown. If the surface area of the person who is blowing air is the same as the surface area of the air being blown, then if each person is blowing approximately the same amount of air, then you have 1 normal nose nose\nOutput: 1/5 = 11/2 = 5\nSo the answer to the 1st question was 5.\n\nInput: The average person's weight is between 90 and 110 kilograms. The average height of a person is 5'3\" or 176 centimeters. An adult male is expected to be 120 kilograms and their adult female weight is 120 kilograms. A person's weight or height is multiplied by 25% for a child's weight and 35% for their adult weight.\nOutput: Weight is taken as 1 kg for every 1,000 kilograms. The height of a person is taken as 5 meters for a 90kg person and 2 meters for the 110kg person. The weight of a child is taken as 2 kg for every 1,400 kilograms and 3 kg for the 220kg person. The height of an adult is taken as 4 meters for the 110kg and 120kg person and 4 meters for the 120kg person. So the solution to the 2nd question is 11.6 meters for the 110kg, 132.7 meters for the 120kg and 134.6 meters for the 126kg\n\nInput: A player hits the net with a 30-metre return.

{"text": "This is incorrect\n\nInput:The ball is given by a player on each team to return to the other team.  Players are allowed to run a maximum distance in an attempt to retrieve the ball.  One player must be responsible for every movement the ball enters the opponent's territory.  The player who returns the ball to the opposing team, without the ball escaping, receives 10 bonus points.  The number of points that the player receives is directly proportional to the number of times the ball is stolen:  the bonus points for the first move increases by 10 for every stolen ball, by increments equal to one-half of the stolen ball if the ball is stolen more than once, and by four times the stolen ball if it is stolen more than three times.  The penalty points for the first and third crimes against the ball increase by 15 points, the second and fourth crimes by 20 points, and the fifth and sixth crimes by 30 points.  Players receive one extra bonus point for every pass returned to the opposing team without the ball escaping.  An additional bonus point is awarded for each catch in which the ball is not returned to the opponent, as long as the player runs no more than six steps to return it to its original position.  Two extra bonus points are awarded for each touchdown scored.  Every time more than one player returns the ball he receives an additional bonus.  The number of bonus points awarded for interceptions, fumbles and other defensive miscues is not listed.  All players receive 10 bonus points for every kick return, which is awarded by increments of 10 yards after each successful return.  At least 2 points are added to the total of all penalties, offensive and defensive, in the game.  Players may not return a penalty kick without a replacement and the penalty point value of the penalty kick is added to the amount already received.\nOutput: Ten points = 10/(10 + 1 = 10)\nso the total bonus points are 10 * 1 * 2 = 20\nSo the final answer for each of the following questions is 20\n\nInput: An apple is planted on a piece of land surrounded by fence.

However in this scenario, you are not allowed to be in the reception area of motel B which is located in hotel A. The office building of course can not accommodate you because that area is the only area where your office is located. So where does you hotel car park? That is a good question.   A: motel B B: lobby C: reception area D: hotel A E: office building\nSo hotel C has the same problem as hotel B  You have to park in the lobby of motel C to get to your office  Since hotel C is not far from your office, you can take a car that you own (if you have one) and drive yourself to motel C where you normally park\nThat gives you the most options to minimize costs.

You must have sold your car in the past, and paid to fix all its repairs. You own a car only in good standing because otherwise it would have been a total loss.  What is the total amount of profit that will be made over the course of this year?\nOutput: In calculating the goal, you take out the $1000,000, add 15%, and use 15,000 as your starting estimate of how much you will earn. This will tell you how much of the total goal you will be able to save at the end of the year.\nSo for example, if you earned $400 per month over the course of the year, and made a total profit of $600 and saved $150, that will be the total amount of profit you will be able to get. The total amount of profit you got is $360.  Remember that you saved $50 that month, you will need to earn at least that much over the rest of the year. So at the end of this year you can have an average total annual return of 15%.\nSo the final answer will be $600 + $150 = $720\n\nOutput:Let $5,000 be the cash flow for the month. Let $3,000 be the sales from the previous month.  Subtract $1,000 from these numbers, and you see that you had:\n$3,000 / $5,000 = $300\n$1,000 / $3,000 = $400\n$400 / 3,000 = $600\n$600 / 3,000 = 5.5\nso this makes your cash flow for this month $350\nAnd thus your total amount of sales for the month is:\n$5,000 / (1.50 + 1.00 - 1.00)/12 = $25", "answer": "C: desk drawer"}

So the total strength for a cord is 560 * 2.2 = 560*2.2 = 880kg per meter.  Thus the total strength of this cord is 880 kg per meter. That is right\n\ninput: a) One pound of butter costs the same in dollars as five pounds of flour. b) The difference in cost per pound of butter is 5% per pound. c) Five pounds of butter cost the same in dollars as 10 pounds of flour. d) The difference in cost of the butter is 1% per pound. e) The difference in cost", "answer": "C: architect"}

In fact, as you point out, the 'fence' is usually less the fence than it is a straightaway. In our case, California, Michigan, and California agree, but Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington disagree. That is, they are 'on the fence', but not 'on the fence' at the same time. Output: They agree, but 'on the fence' is not the same as a'straightaway' or 'off the fence'. Both are still 'on the fence'.\nOutput: (1/4)^(2)*120 = 10\nSo they agree, but not 'on the same footing'. Both are still on the ground. And what makes this particular 'off the fence' is the fact that at an off the same footing, each of these three states are on the other 2/3s of the fence, and only then does their fence become 'fence-like'\nOutput: (1+((1/4)*120)*1200)^12 = (2/3)*1200 + (2/3)*120 = 2400\nSo they agree, and agree 'on the same footing', but differ at the other 2/3 of the fence.

That is one reason they only look at average and don't control for time or space.  There are other reasons, too.  People want to know how many of these days a person spends in bed or on the phone.

Maybe they don' need to spend hours on the computer and then walk everywhere.  Or perhaps they just don't have the right computer software for sleeping.  And lastly, if you have a high body mass index, it is more important to sleep to maintain a healthy number on your resting heart rate in order to stay healthy.

How much would this total amount be?\nOutput: The total income of each child in a year is $2,000,000, so 200k/12=200K per month.  If 10 children worked 12 hours per month, the total amount they received this year would be $400,000.

Each state sets its own driving test requirements.  If you fail your test you need to take a different road test every time you try to get hired. That road test costs $140 to take, so total cost is $170 to pass.  What do you pass every time you attempt to become a truck driver?\nOutput: If you pass your first road test, you only need to take one more road test every three years to get your driving privileges back. If you fail your test it costs $100 every time you need to take another test\nSo the price of the road test is $100/3 = $150-$250 every three years.\nSo the final total income will be $150-$850/3 = $1500-$10300/3 years\nThat means you earn $150-$10300/3 = $1500 to $20000 a year when you first pass your road test\nSo if you pay $450 to take the road test you will earn $450 every three years\nSo the final answer will be $400 for every three years\n\nInput: The total value of stocks in a portfolio is $500,000.

{"text": "A\n\nSource:The question is a little unclear. \"Where would a person keep (or have kept) a book while it's (being) read?\" is a form of a sentence question, and it has a conditional clause: It doesn't say whether the book stays with the person, it says whether he keeps (or has kept) it (which is a form of the past-tense verb phrase, where one would say whether a thing is kept or not). The first part of the question is in the form of a question, so that makes it count.\n\nThe sentence \"A person keeps a book while being read.\" has a conditional clause. The \"A\" is a preposition (it means \"in\"), so it's asking whether the book is being kept; if it is, then it stays with the person; if it isn't, it doesn't stay with the person; if everyone stays the same, then the book leaves with the person who reads it; if everyone leaves the book, then it leaves without the person who reads it (and with the person who read it). So, it's saying that if a person keeps a book and/or he keeps it, then the book stays with him; but if it's just sitting in the bookcase after everyone leaves, then it leaves without him; and if everyone changes the book, then it's leaving without him.\n\nAlso, \"A person keeps a (book) while being read\" is a sentence; the word \"book\" is not a tautology (a double exclamation point, or a comma, for example). The question, then, is a question as well, which makes it count for multiple-choice as well.\n\nThe answer is A. If a person keeps a book, then it stays with him.\n\nInput: Each week for four weeks, Mary gave Jane a book to read, and Jane gave Mary a book to read, in turn.

How long is it before her family can find her a new doctor (doctor A)?\nOutput: The answer depends on the number of minutes Mary can be found at work.  If she is able to get to the doctor in thirty minutes, she will be given a transplant surgeon to perform the operation.  If she can get to the doctor in an hour, she will have to be operated on by an interventional cardiologist.  An intraluminal catheter is inserted into the aorta (the main artery that carries blood from your heart to your legs) and a small cannula is attached to a small tube connected to the heart. This tiny tube carries a tiny amount of blood and fluids from side to side into the left ventricle (the inner or main chamber of the heart).  Once this catheter is inserted, the drugs are placed into the right ventricle and the catheter is left in place.  Over several weeks, all of the drugs are removed.  Next, the catheter is taken out and the patient is monitored carefully for the next few weeks to ensure that she is not doing any re-filling of the vessel with fluids.  Then the catheter is removed again, and the drugs are placed back into the right ventricles and the process is repeated.  After four weeks, the catheters are removed, the drug is replaced (it is a new drug and works for many months after the original drug is administered and is administered multiple times).  Then the catheter was removed for final time (it was removed after about a year and a few months).  From these calculations, it is possible to calculate the time needed to complete the operation.  If the doctor\u2019s time is 10 minutes, then it will take 10 minutes to find a new doctor.  If the doctor is 1,000 feet away, he will have to drive a thousand feet to find his next patient.

The reason is that there is demand because there are fewer trucks on the road.  If there were just 10 fewer trucks on the road, the price would stay the same.  If there were more trucks on the road, however, then the price would increase because trucks have to travel longer distances to get to their destinations.  The result is that the price per gallon rises by 10% over any given time period.  The reason this causes gas prices to remain the same over a given time period is that the number of trucks on the road has remained the same, so the demand isn't increased or decreased.  Therefore, the final price per gallon remains constant.  Of course, if the number of trucks on a specific day increases (the days over the given time period) then the price will increase, and vice versa.\nOutput: The final price per gallon of gas remains constant since there is no change in the number of trucks on specific dates.\nThus it rises by 10% over a time period\nSo the final answer remains 10% over the time period\n\nInput: A man buys an air-conditioner.

How much work is completed each week at the company?\nOutput: The average weekly work done by each of 10 employees is 1.2*10=2.6 hours = 60 hours\nSo the average week is 60 total hours which is 24 * 10=240 hours\nSo the total hours worked by all 10 employees every week is 8 hours 48 minutes = 480 hour = 960 = 48.6 hours\nSo with a workforce of 360 employees per week this results in 960*4 = 960 workers a week\nSo the total number of hours worked by all employees each week is 960\nSo the final answer 1,640\n\nInput: Mary and Robert walk out to an area of lawn that is half covered with snow.

It plans to build a prison to hold them without harming them.  What were the terms of the deal made when the United States provided material support to this venture so that Japan would not retaliate by building it's own prison?\nOutput: On December 18, 1943 the United States offered Japanese prisoners of war $2,000 American dollars to return to Japan.  This offer was turned down because Japan did not want to spend $2,000, and wanted a $1,000 fine per prisoner.  A Japanese prison would result in 10,000 men a year being released for the duration of construction, as opposed to 3,000.\n\n The United States government wants Japan to build a prison for these prisoners.  According to the agreement signed, the United States would supply $2,000,000 in material, and would build the prison on the island of Hokkaido. What is the ratio of this amount to the amount that the United States agreed to pay in order to get Japan to build the prison?\nOutput: The total cost of the Japanese prisoner of war prison was $10,000,000. If it were built, 9,900 prisoners would be freed annually. The cost of labor for this prison would total $100,000,000, which would be covered by the loan made by the U.S with the Japanese government.\nSo for the amount that the U.S. government paid in order to build the prison, the ratio is $100,000,001 + $2,000,001 = $15,000,000\nSo the final answer to the quiz is 15,000,000\n\nInput: The total amount of water in the United States is 880 billion cubic meters.

John is getting close.  What is the reason for this?\nOutput:\n- Sales should only increase $1000*100 = $500 each month.\n- Revenue should only be $500*100 = $400 per month.\n- The company makes a profit of $400 per month.  Therefore $500 is being paid out to employees for each month, but only $400 is being deducted from that profit.\n- He has a profit of $400 a month and is giving all the money he makes to his wife.\nSo the total amount of money that is being paid out as salary each month is $400 + $200 = $600 each month, but it would cost twice as much as $500 to pay all employees $2,000 each month.\nSo the final total is $600 + $200*2 + $500*2 + $400*2 = $924 which is $12,200 less than", "answer": "A: family room"}

A technician measures the distance to a vital organ within the body.  The technician does not know the size of the organ. The doctor gives the technician the numbers and asks her to draw the organs' distances from one another.   What values does the doctor use in calculating the distance of the organs to each other?\nOutput:The distance between the organs is calculated by dividing the diameter of the body by the square root of the distance. That is: (di*sqrt(di)) ^(di*sqrt(sqrt(di))).\nA is the diciplinary value by multiplying the units of the distances by 1.1. In this example: (di*sq. 8)^(4) = 7.2\nB is the number of units to give (di*sqrt (i)) for each distance, by integrating the two, and finding the result. That is: (-i*sqrt(di) +i*sqrt(sq. 2)*i).\nC is the square root given by integrating to get a value of 1/(i*sqrt(i)) for each distance:\ni = i*sqrt(i)*i\nSo (i*i)^(i) = 0.02\nD is the distance multiplied by 1/4 which is the number of feet in a yard, divided by 2:\nD = (di*sqrt 4)^2\nE is the square root given in terms of time:\nE*sqr 3 / 8\nSo (E/8)(-2)/8 = 0.001*0.02\nThe final answer is 0\n\nInput: Two golf clubs are put into the woods.

It costs $50 per day to service two cars. How much does it cost per year to service 24 cars?\nSubtract the cost per year to service two cars from the daily cost to service 24 cars.\nSubtract the hourly rate of service to repair or replace something in all of the cars from the daily repair rate of the cars.\nIf you can do this, then the cost to service 24 cars for the cost of the service to repair or replace one car per day will be 40 x $50 = $1200 per year.\nTherefore the final cost to repair four cars is 40*1/20 = $60x $1200 = $12,600\nTherefore the cost to repair one car is $36 x $12,600 = $120\nTherefore the final cost of repairing 24 cars is 40*12x$1200 x$1200 = $56,600\nTherefore the final cost for repairing 8 cars is 40*1200 x$1600 x$1600 = $160,000\nTherefore the final cost is $160,000 x8 = $160,000 which is less than $16,000\nTherefore it seems to me that all of this $160,000 will be less than $16,250", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

The price of soybeans goes up by the same amount.\nTo make matters worse, the farmers use less fertilizer during the same period.  Therefore, the price of soybeans goes down.  Every year the price of coffee goes up by $2.00 because farmers use less coffee fertilizer.  The price of wheat goes up for the same reasons.  Every year the cost of gasoline goes up by $.02 or $.03.\nSo each year the average price of corn, soybeans, and coffee is $2.00 more than it was last year.\nThat means the average price of corn is $2.20 more this year than last year.  The average price of soybeans and coffee is $3.20 more each than last year.\nThat implies the average price of all products in the shop is $3.40 more than last year.\nSo the average price of all items in the shop is now $4.40 more than last years price.\nThat means the total amount spent in the shop per year is $3.40 * $40 = $<<$3/(40-40>$3>$3).\nSo the total amount a week goes up by is $3.40*10-40=<<868+868>(868+868>868>868>>868).\nThat means you spend $868 week.\n\nInput: A couple of players on the same team are good at soccer, baseball, basketball, and football.

He stayed there as long as possible, and the bus did not stop before he got home due to snow. His drive would have been delayed for a day on Monday, and his drive would have been delayed by about 2 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Since the bus did not stop for a day, that would make his drive on Tuesday from the event to home slightly delayed but be on time with the snow storm. his drive would be delayed by a day or two on Wednesday because of the delay on the bus.\nOn Tuesday morning the bus was late, and on the day of the snow storm Bill was out of town.  However, his drive on Tuesday would have been delayed as described before, and his drive would not have been delayed by the snow that was piled up on the streets of New York City on Tuesday. So his snow storm would have been delayed slightly for Tuesday. And since his drive would have been slightly delayed, his late bus would have been delayed for less than a day.\nOn Wednesday he was in New York City, and on his way home there was snow on the streets. On the way home Bill had to drive the bus, which was delayed due to the poor weather. Because the bus was delayed, that would have pushed the snow accumulation on the roads, and so on.

The cost of living in Pittsburgh is $4,000 per month. Each of Mr. X and Mr Y spends $700 per month, or $20,000.00 on the price of their housing. Given their savings and the price of housing in Pittsburgh over the last year, what is the total income of them?\nInput: Mr. X and Mr... are married with 3 children. The marriage is not recognized by the IRS. Therefore, Mr. X spends $600 per month, or $5,200 per year, on housing. Mr. Y spends $600 per month or $5,400 per year on housing. Divide $200 by $5,200 over 12 months, and you get $3,200.00 per year.

The average driver burns about 2.75 gallons a day. How much gas is available for a car to fill a tank for a typical driver?\nOutput: The entire tank is 1 gallon.\nSo in total, each person gets 0.5 gallons of liquid to fill their tank\nSo the final answer will be 1.25\n\nOutput: The government's goal for water conservance is that by 2015 there should be no more than two gallons of water per toilet flush. What is enough water and how much should there be, considering that you use toilet flushes on average 5 times a day? The EPA says you need 7 cubic feet of water per flush, so if you flush every time you go to the bathroom, then it would take you 7.5 cubic feet of water to flush every bathroom. Is that enough?\nOutput: The EPA's goal is that by 2015, there should be no more water to flush. So far, less than 2.5 gallons of water have been conserved.\nSo a typical person will need 1.5 gallons of water to fill his or her tank.\nSo the final total is 0.5 gallons of water = 0.5*0.5 = 0.8 gallons of liquid for the average person.\n\nInput: The average distance for an automobile to go is 300 feet.

That is 1 gallon of gasoline per three days, and 1 gallon every two days, so you need 3000 gallons of gas every three days.

He has played five rounds with Rosie on Saturdays and Sundays.  When it is time to take naps every day, when the cat goes to bed after a nap, when to go to bed after naps depends on the amount of time Tom spent playing with each cat.  Tom's current cats are 6.  He spent most of all play time with Rosie.  He was the only one to give Rosie many hugs.  If one of the cats is the owner for one minute, does Rosie really have that owner for 1 minute?\nOutput: If Tom has a 6 minute cat, does that cat really have all 6 minutes to play with?  If so, it still is possible to have two hours of play for a single cat.  So a 6 minute cat has 2 hours playing time with Tom, 30 minutes in total.\nOutput: If Tom's current cats are Mike and Dolly, then Tom is playing with half of them.  Babe and Rosie are playing only with their half of cat.  If Mike goes for a nap after playing, does Mike really have to nap for half a half hour?\nOutput: If two of the 7 cats belonged to Tom, would he need 6 minutes to play with those cats?\nOutput: Yes, he would need 6 minutes and 30 seconds at least for Mike.

After getting up, he put the balls in motion.  This would also sleep the balls in A.  Thus, the total time he was asleep was one-half hour in duration, and therefore the total number of sleep cycles was four.  To make it more explicit, suppose that James woke after 12 hours and 36 minutes.  This would be 24 hours and 36 minutes of sleep, which would equal one sleep cycle.  In this case, the total number of sleep cycle was the same as two, and therefore James would sleep one-half hour and 36 minutes and have one repeat and eight sleep cycles (the answer was 56, because 28 * 12 = 56).  As predicted, when James woke in the morning instead of two minutes before, the bouncing ball balls all went in motion.  Thus, after 12 hours and 36 seconds, the bouncing balls were in motion and had four sleep cycles.  Note that the total number of sleep-cycles was 4 for 36 seconds.

How does that affect the organization's bottom line? Answer:The money raised in month one should have been used to help season ticket holders.  But that was not done, so money raised in month two cannot be used to help season ticket holder's unless revenues equal the sum of the money that was raised in month one minus money raised in month three. So it would have been a $90 loss for the organization to spend in month three. Therefore, at the end of the year if revenues are equal to the sum of month one and month two revenues, there would be no need to use any money left over from the past year to help in the future.\nThat means the final answer is:\n\nOutput: Bill $1,000 - Food $2,000 - Food $3,000 - Food $4,000 - Food $5,000 - Food $6,000 - Food $7,000 - Food $9,000 - Food $10,000 - Food $12,000 - Food $13,000 + Food $14,000 - Food $15,000 + Food $20,000 + Food $25,000 + Food $30,000 + Food $35,000 + Food $40,000 + Food $45,000 + Food $50,000 + Food $55,000 + Food $60,000 + Food $65,000 + Food $70,000 + Food $75,000 + Food $80,000 + Food $90,", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

This money is withdrawn in US dollars and held in an American deposit account.  The sister lives in Las Vegas, NV and works as a nurse.  Every year she sends another $200 to John.  When John goes there she has to bring a letter from his sister.  The sister needs to see the money because she has to pay taxes on the funds.  Given John's $6000 in savings he has $2400 in his savings account, and $2000 in his checking account, plus an additional $400 in his allowance.  The sister will request that John send her $2400 to cover taxes.  If they do not, John has to ask his sister to forgive $1200 of the requested $300.\nThe only way John can spend the money before taxes is to take it to the bank, then they can deposit it back into his account.  Given John's account balance of $6000 he can purchase $2500 worth of goods, including one item that is out of stock.  At what price should John pay the sister?\nOutput: John must ask the sister to forgive $1200.  Given $6000 in savings, the total balance of his account is $2300.  The total value of goods John buys for $2500 is $2400.  So $1200 must be forgiven or the account balance must increase by: $1200 * $600 = $1200 for each $600 in savings.  The $1200 he needs to ask the sister to forgive amounts to $1200 divided by the $600 saved by his $6000 in savings.  So the total amount owed to the sister is $1600 divided by the $600 already saved.  $1600 divided by $600 = $1200.  If the sister received $1200 for giving the money to John, then the sister is owed $1200 by $600.  She can then buy herself another $1200 or $600.\nSo John owes his sister $1200.

The teams do not score more than 20 points per game. So, how many points does one player score per game?\nOutput: For a player on team A to score 10 points he has to score 0.55 points per player per game, which is 2*5 = 10.56 points per game. For a player on team B to score 5 points she has to score 0.45 points per player per game. That means that if she scores 5 points, she has to score 2 points from her teammates. So, if she scores 5 points her teammates have to average 2.55 points per game. That's 3 points per game in addition to the 1 from her team. That adds up to 4 points for Team A and 2 points per game for Team B. That's 10 points for Team A, 6 points for Team B. Total: 10.56 x 2 = 31.56 points for Team A and 5.12 points for Team B\nSo Team A had 31.56 points, Team B had 31.55 points. So Team A scored 28.24 points, Team B had 28.24 points\nThat is, Team A scored 28, Team B scored 30, so A had 28, B had 28, so that team had 30\n\nInput: A team has 4,000 players who play on it during an average year.

Another $10,000 (20%) is withheld from them each day. The final salary is $100,000. On average, the players in this team make $1000 per month. What percentage of their salary goes to taxes?\nOutput: The total amount withheld from these players per month is $110,000. On average they make $100 per month. Therefore, after taxes these players make $500 per month. That's $500 divided by $99 per month = $5 per month.

How many credits required by the college for enrollment does the extra 450 students take in a year?\nOutput:The number of credits needed to enroll at community college increases by 45 each year to a maximum 5,200.  The extra 450 students are permitted to take no more than 10 credits per semesters.  In this case the additional 450 students are counted as taking 1 and 7 credits each semester\nThen the extra 900 students for a total of 900 credits are counted as taking 7 credits each semester. After the extra 450 students the maximum number permitted to enroll at the college is 5,200.\nOutput: The number of credits needed to graduate increases by 200 each year to a maximum 7,600\nThen the additional 900 students for a total new total of 900 credits are graduated\nOutput: The number graduated increases by 200 each year.\nSo the total number of credits needed for graduation can be found by subtracting 200 from the initial number. In your example you are solving for a class with an enrollment of 7,600 for a total of 7,600.  That is 7 and 150 = 500. The 7 credits needed to be enrolled for graduation can be divided by that number. So in your example you are finding a class that will have six students per class and a total of 6,400 per semester. So the 700 credits needed for graduation can then be divided by 6,400 to get 5,600. The 400 needed for graduation can be divided", "answer": "A: seaside town"}

How can the man get free?\nOutput: **A** The man gets out of the car.\n[Answer by Jim Neesmith):  If the man is already out of the car, then there is no way for him to get out, since there's no exit. In this particular example, the man had gotten out of the car. We know that this isn't possible, because the car is not destroyed. We also know that the man didn't just get trapped because we see him out of the window. The car is moving. We see a woman standing outside the car with a towel up to her chin. She is saying \"It is really dangerous, isn't it?\" or \"I don't want to get back inside that car.\", etc. These imply that the car cannot be still, and therefore can \"move\" the body or object. If we can't see a body or object, how can we know it is still.\n[Answer by James Wilbur (JAMES WILBUR):  In this example, the man is outside the car and the car is moving.  However, the car's body is stationary and he is still inside the car.  Therefore, he can't get out.

The first is to merge the two lanes to a single lane. The second option is to widen the center of the lane. The first option will create a wider lane. The more lanes that have an equal chance of getting wet, the worse the traffic will be. The second option will create a narrower lane. In doing the first option, you will have more traffic in the right lane, which will put more pressure on the drivers in the left lane. If the left lane is not more congested than the right lane, you're better off staying in the left lane.\"  Answer: Merging the two lanes creates a single lane.  Widening the center of the lane creates a narrower lane, which then degrades faster.  The more lanes that need to be flooded for flooding to occur, the more accidents will result.  Also, the right lane does not get wet as much as the left lane.  It does need to get wet, so it can be more congested. If you're in the right lane it is more important to have more lanes to give everyone a chance to get wet. Otherwise, you can't leave the center of the lane in place.  Also, when the right lane gets wet, you have a higher chance of getting stuck. It would be better to just keep driving until you get into the left lane.  When you reach that lane, you will have a higher chance of staying in the left lane.\nThe correct answer is A\n\nInput: At night, John walks home from his job at the library.

On average, division players earn 12.6% less and league players earn 13.3% less than league average starters.  How many league players and how many of these division players earn $2,500 per week?\nOutput: This tells you that the typical division player will earn $2,500 and the average league player will earn $2 454.7. So the average division player will earn $922.5 per week and average league player will earn 921.6. So division players will earn 10% less than the typical player and the average player will earn 7.4% more. Thus, the division players earn 992.7 times as much money and the average player 976.7 times as much. So the average division and average league player each earn more than the typical player which shows that the average division player and average member of the average division earned more than the typical member of the typical division and average league player.

And yes, a teacher who always has to take lunch and has to stop and pick up things for an ill kid is probably more likely to make more than a teacher who is paid more than they need to and has to find a second job for part of the year.  But teachers in rich schools don't always work all year round, so they make a lot less than teachers in poor schools.  But teachers in poor schools also do not have to make full-time work their life goal.  Therefore their earnings are not as dependent on having to find a side job or on students from rich schools coming in underperforming.\n\nInput: James is a salesman in a department store who works about one week in the middle of the year.

So he makes $85 per week.\nThere is no way to estimate that $85 / 7 = $5.75 since he only works during the middle of the year and spends most of the year in the classroom.

The grandpa said what a great idea he thought,  but then he said that it was wrong that he hadn't learned how to read and therefore he couldn't teach other people how to read..\nSo he thought about what he said carefully,  he asked his father and mother if they thought it was wrong that a man should be able to read his computer and email or his mother and grandmother if everyone used email instead of calling each other.\nSo after he did a little research he decided to do just what he wanted to do anyway,  he went to the library and checked out some books on reading to children and asked his father if he would like to accompany him. He had read some of them on television and on the radio. The books were The Very Hungry Hungry Caterpillar, The Tale of Peter Rabbit and The Very Hungry Caterpillar Again. His dad said he could stay if he took with him one book or one picture. He said he would take The Very Hungry Hungry Caterpillars book because everybody loved that book and everybody seemed to enjoy seeing his face light up with excitement when it came on the television.\nSo the two of them and their father went to the library and went on to buy five books one for the grandpa and the five for the child who had been wanting to teach his grandfather to read. After they brought the books home, they opened up each book and went through the pictures in it with his Grandpa, and the grandpa was delighted with the pictures he saw and the words he read from the book, so he made the child laugh with some of the words he read, and when he finished he went on the computer and checked his email and his cell phone and then he went to the bathroom and made sure he'd have time to answer his emails before he got to the computer.\nWhen the time came, he looked at the email he had to respond to and saw that it was from his mother and then he had to take his own time to go on to the email and answer the first message, then he looked his phone and saw it was his mother's. The last message was from his grandmother and said that she had left the stove on, but it was turned off when she was gone.

On Friday they have $100 deposited in ATMs and $600 at a branch.  How much in liquid assets are they left with on Monday?\nOutput: $100 - $600-$856 = $6.56\nSo Saturday was a bad day to run a large withdrawal out of an ATM.\n\nInput: John was told by the IRS to deduct $80 from his W-2.  He chose to take that amount out of his mortgage payment, and put all $80 in savings.  How does he account for the shortfall between the $80 and the mortgage?\nOutput: He accounts for it by increasing the interest rate by $20/month.  Since the mortgage starts with 25%, John pays $200 to the mortgage each month.  He pays $600 to the mortgage company every month.  Now he has a mortgage loan of $1,160.  His interest rate is now 75% higher than the 25% he had originally paid.  So his monthly payment drops to $420/month.  That increases the value of his house by 35% over three months, pushing his mortgage payment to $720 per month.  This keeps the value at $2,000 and lowers his tax bill.  Now he has more of an asset to trade in at the market for than he did before.\nInput: Jane has $40,000 in savings.  She spends $4,100 each month on her mortgage payment.  She is responsible for $13,200 dollars in maintenance and savings.  How much does she have left for liquid assets, after having spent $14,400 dollars on her mortgage and taking out $8,100 in loans over three months?\nOutput: $40,000 - $8100-$81400 = $10,400\nSo if Jane took out $10,400 of debt over three months on a $1,200 per month mortgage, she would then have a net worth of $10,000.  So the final amount she has left is $10,400.  There was money left over, but it wouldn't be worth $10,400 for a three-month loan.

Tom says he can pay the $1 out of pocket as many times as he needs, but it becomes difficult to afford it.\nOutput: Tom pays a $25 deductible a year for his health insurance and $600 for Jane's insurance. So he pays $75 for each of the three years, $75 in year 1, $100 in year 2, and $600 in year 3.

The answer is the distance from a fixed point on Earth's surface to the equator. For the following calculation, the distance from Washington D.C. to New York is 725.5 Miles. So a 0.25Km circle would be a kilometre. Now, try the following calculation for a 0.25 mile circle. The distance from Washington D. C. to New York is 825.5 Km, so subtract 0.5 Km. You have to multiply each time you do the 0.25Km distance calculation by the number of Km in Km.

It should be cheaper for some (but not all) goods than others. If food will cost too much, demand for food will increase. This is called deflation. If food will cost less than other goods, inflation will occur. This is called inflation\nOutput: If the dollar will be less then its current value, buying goods will be cheaper.  It will be more than the dollar will cost in a month or in one year\nThat means the dollar will be more than $1.00 in 3 months... or one year.... after a year there will be more then $1.00 left\nOutput: If the value of the dollar will be $1.00 or less  that means buying goods will be cheaper than renting a single room\nThis is not always true - there are many items such as home appliances that cost over $1000.00 even though they are not needed\nOutput: Buying goods is cheaper than renting a rented room\nIn addition, most people would rather buy something than rent a room\nThis means that the cost of the goods is cheaper than renting the room\nOutput: Buying food will cost less than renting a room since the dollar will cost less in 3 months..\nOutput: Buying groceries will cost less than renting an apartment since the dollar will cost little in a year\nOutput: Buying more groceries than you can handle is more profitable than renting an apartment.

He sold his shares for the full price he paid for those shares plus an additional $7,000 because he preferred shares which were more expensive to start with.  How much money did he end up making?\nOutput: William bought 200,000 shares at $300.  He sold them for $360.  He bought them again at $380 and sold them for $490.  He bought 200 more shares at $480.  He sold them again at $550 and bought another 200 at $560.  He bought 200 shares at $600.  He sold them at $610 and bought another 200 at another $610.  He bought 200 at $620.  He sold all of those shares for $710, so the net result was $7,020.  Based on his logic the net amount he invested in the stock exchange was $100,000*300.  So the net amount he made was $200,000*300*200 = $700,000.\nOutput: He bought 200,000 stocks and sold them for $700,000.  He bought 200 the same day and sold them for $1200.  He bought $200 the next day and sold them for another $200 the next day.  He bought another 200 the next day and sold his remaining 200 shares for another $200 the second day.  He bought 2 further shares the next day and sold the remaining 200 the second day.  Then, the third day he bought 500 shares at $310 and sold the remaining 600 shares at $360.\nOutput: Assuming he bought another 200 at $310 the fourth day he would have lost the net amount invested.

What is the percent for Europe?  How can you find out the percentage of your country?  In fact, you should get a program telling you how many Americans or Europeans have different ailments.  You have to fill an address for each one.  But, if you do it on your own, you can get more data by choosing a different country each time.  How can you find the data?  There are a lot of programs out there to find out different statistics.  You can't find them all though.  One program to find these answers is Ehealth.\nOutput: The number of Americans with a disability and the percentage in your country is 40/100*40=<<40*40=/=40>>40\nWhat percent of Americans in 2001 are disabled and what percent can you find?\nThen, for the question C: work all day D: had a bad day.  Let's assume A and D are each equally likely, then A = 0 and D = 1.  If A and D are equal, then you get E = 1.\nSo for the question E: I know how old you are, let's say you're 16 in 2000 or 16 in 2001.  The problem with A=0 is that it looks odd, so I chose B=1, then C=2 and then E=3.  How do you do it so it looks OK?\nOutput: You can't get all four answers.

How can you tell that 50 % ofAmericans are 16 in 2000 and less than half of them in 2001?\nSo for the question B: lonely.  You can figure out the percentage by looking at the average answer for the number of comments in a blog post.

Given that all 100 houses had carpeting, he needed 16 carpeting tiles.\nNow suppose there were a choice between carpeting a room or carpeting a bathroom with only a floor.  What should he do?  Choose the bathroom.  Given all tiles, he needs 48 tiles.\nHe now needs 16 tile tiles to make his own carpeting to make floors!\nGiven that each tile should cost the same as the tile alone, he needs 24 tiles.\nTo make the floors look good, he needs 6 more tiles, so he needs 16 tiles.\nThus, the total number of tiles he needs for his carpeting is 160!  So he needs 24 tiles.  He needs to use some tiles (16 tiles) and use some others (24 tiles).  Thus his total carpet needs are 136!  And then at the end of the floor, he needs to have 40 tiles.  This leaves 72 tiles to use during the day to make the floors as nice as possible.\nEach tile will always have a square at the end that runs perpendicular to the direction of the carpet pattern.

That equates to 200 miles an hin\nThat means he put 250+4seconds into accelerating to 200 miles an hiin.  That equated to 250 miles an hiin\nThis equates to 300 miles an hin\n So he put 310+4seconds into accelerating the engine and he got to 300 miles an hiin  That equates to 300 miles\nSubtracting 30 for each 4seconds he put into the engine\nHe put 4 seconds into accelerate the engine to 40 miles an hin.

{"text": "By not allowing the heifer to live in the cow's barn or dairy farm, compassionate farmer is saving the cow's valuable life\nSo compassionate farmer saves a cow's life\n\nInput:The average person would pay $100 per year in taxes each year if they withheld nothing in taxes.  The exact same would happen if they added $10 every paycheck and paid their taxes promptly.  If this is true, the tax withholdings you do now are equivalent to about 50 cents per paycheck from a 10 % tax withholding rate.  So adding $10 a paycheck to your withholding and not taking it out of your paycheck every check is equivalent to an extra $20 a month.  This is the amount of tax savings you need to pay for an IRA next year.\nInput: The average family can expect to pay $1,000 per year into their retirement plan next year if they pay their contributions promptly.  They can expect to save $1,000 per month by not taking out their contributions from those contributions each month.  You will realize savings on every check that you will receive in retirement by withholding $10 per paycheck from each paycheck you receive in retirement. Add this up and you will end up with an extra $1,000 per quarter of retirement income.\nOutput: Add $10 per paycheck to your retirement contributions next year.  This is $500 extra every month for the next quarter. This reduces your taxes by $300.\nYour retirement income will be $1,000 > $100, $1,000 >... > $1000 >... >.. > $1500 >... >, so $500 in retirement contributions each quarter is less than an extra $1000 in your retirement fund\nSo the savings on each check that will occur as a result of withholding $10 instead of taking out is $1,000 + $600 * 2 = $2,000\n\nExample 1: John purchased three boxes of 20 kg of peanuts for $200.

So one can say that 50% of all households have telephone lines, while 50% of Americans have telephones. (This also means that some people had mobile phones, like Tim.)

To find out how many S's are in a word, take the number of letters in the first word and add the last word\nThen, take the first number and add both together.  If there are more than 7 S words then you also find the total number of  words in the sentence:\n7 + 4 +. = 14 + 8 = 20 + 16 = 28.\nThe total number of words in the sentence is 35.  So in total there are 35 S words in the sentence.  Now consider this, assuming that the number of words in every word is 7, then you find the number of syllables in the sentence:\n35 + 7 + 8 = 84\nSo there are 84 syllables in the sentence, which is less than 1,000\nSo the number of words in the first word is 1,068.  The number of words in every S word is 35 and in every  word is 21 so you get 1,048 syllables which is 1,080 words.\nThen you add 26 to 8 and find:\n1 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 3.\nSo you get:\n1 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 7.\nSo you get 1,078 words in the sentence.\nSo you can see that there are 726 words of S words in the sentence, which makes the total number of S words in the word 1,879.\nIt is my conviction that an important feature of words is that they are words, so I will sum up, and not repeat or add to, the points discussed.\n\nInput: \"What do you want to say to a beautiful woman?\" (Choose the best response above)\nOutput: \"What do you say to a beautiful woman? \" What does an attractive woman want?

What number of times has this situation played into the cost of having a child?\nOutput: Approximately 25 times. The total cost of treatment of a single child is $100,000. So the $12,400 cost of every single child born each year is $6000.00.\nSo in total, this situation is equivalent to paying that single child $6000.00. This does not include medical costs for their parents or other family members.\nIn total the total cost is $6000.00 * 25. The number of parents paying for a child born annually is about 200 for each year between the ages of 18 and 35.

How much money does the average woman make?\nOutput:  It is estimated that women who sell sperm and eggs between January and April will make about $60,000 a year.  Women who sell eggs between April and November will make about $100,000 a year.\nSo the average woman will make $60,000 a month, or $6,600 a week, or $4,300 a month, or $40,600 a week. The $40,600 number, which is in the \"middle,\" is not in the \"upper half\" of what one would expect.  There is one female buyer, which means that only two or three women each year are selling their eggs, and three or four women sell the sperm.  But only two to three women sell at any one time so there are not 100 million women selling their eggs or sperm at any one time.  Therefore the average woman is receiving 50 women each year, or just 12 \"women\" per year.  So the average woman will receive $12,000 a month, about 4 times her annual salary of $6,600.

That is the three separate times they plan to marry.\nSince two people who plan to marry do not want to consider splitting up for a period before they get married, they will not begin to talk about splitting up until they get married. In case they decide to divorce before the marriage starts, this means that they will split up for at least six months before they meet again.

That is the three distinct times they will discuss their marriage.

In the first year you have the same discount as a buyer who bought a brand new car, so lets take that as a baseline, after the first year you get a \u00a3500 bonus, but only if you stay with the company that bought the car.\nSo we'll say that the car is worth \u00a36,500, and you can get it for \u00a35,100 with a discount from the car's previous owner.  This means that the car will cost you \u00a35,100*6,500= \u00a313,000.  This", "answer": "D: office supply store"}

The first task is to read an article online for 30 minutes. He spent 11 hours on that. The second task is to calculate a percentage change in the market for a given product. He started this task by entering a year, the current market rate, and the number of products.   He spent about 3 hours on this.  His total work week is: 21.5 hours, he did 21.   That equals 6.5 hours per day doing nothing at all. How many hours does he take off?   3 * 6= 27.2 hours.   Divide that by the number of hours he leaves on his days off (2.5 * 7.5 = 6 hours each day) and add that to your answer.\nSo he takes 6.5 hours each day to do nothing and still leaves enough time for chores (the other two tasks that have been assigned him)  And, of course, that doesn't take into account other things going on. If he's out at a restaurant or with friends or at home with kids or with friends and kids, he still doesn't take that time out. His total time working is 27.2 hours.\nSo for this question he took at least 5 of the 6 hours off.   And he is still a very busy guy, and it seems that he's working on the computer, eating and drinking and generally having a great time. So given how busy he is, why wouldn't he spend 5 of the 6 hours doing nothing?\nTo answer the second question, how much of", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

A local builder can build a two-bedroom house for $100,000.  In one year, the builder can sell it for $250,000.  Based on that annual cost, how much money did the builder lose in that year?  Output: $150,000 - 100,000 = $150,000 - $250,000 = $250,000\nOutput $350,000 - 100,001 = $350,000 - $250K = $250K - $250K =\n$260,000 - 100,012 = $260,000 - $250 * 3 =\n$300,000 - 100,013 = $300,000 - $250x3 = $300,000 / 3 = $650,000\nNow suppose builder wants to make a profit on his investment.  As we know his $250K loss in year 1.  He will sell his $200K house in year 2.  To do that $200K - 100,000 = 100,000 - 100, 000 =\n$150,000 * 3 = $75,000 $150,000 * 4 = $150,000 / 4 = 90,000 $150, 000 * 5 = $250,000 / 5 = $1,500,000\n$150, 000 / 50,000 x 5 = $150,000/50,000 x 2 = $500,000\n$350, 000 / 50, 000 x 5 = $350, 000 / 5 = $1.7 million\nSo the total loss of this builder in the $1.7 million year was $350, 000.  The loss of his $250K house in year 1 was also $250, 000.  Now for year 2 the builder made $750,000.  Based that on his $750K in", "answer": "E: fabric store"}

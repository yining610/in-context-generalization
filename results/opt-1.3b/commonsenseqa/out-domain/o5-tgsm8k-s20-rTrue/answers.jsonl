After they bought their items and paid for them, they came to a total of $180+ $15 = $155.50\nThey could not have more than $15 in their pocket. They could not take any of their remaining money with them back to home.

The difference is the difference in how long the day is and how far north it is so, because it is colder in Canada/Vancouver on July 19th, the difference in how long time there is until it gets dark. So, subtracting -6 from 5:05 and 5.08 makes the number 5:00 but adding -6 to 5.05 makes the number 5:01. So when it gets dark, the difference in time is (5/16) and when it gets light, the difference is 1 (4/16). Therefore, the number 5:00 minus (-6) = 5.\nNow if you subtract all the time we have since July 4th, it still doesn't equal to 5.00, so we are still missing one day. So the temperature at 5:02 p.m. is -6 C and the temperature at 5:03 p.m. is 4 C\nOutput: 5.00 (without taking into account the 3 days this is late in the month)\n\nInput: There are 18", "answer": "D: food court"}

{"text": "The answer to this question depends on whether or not you like your paper and your school. For example, students should NOT leave their papers outside unless they do not like them and it is not getting enough sun. On the other hand, if the sun is too much, they should definitely not leave their papers outside unless it is getting no sun. They should use sunscreen and keep their papers in a cool place but outside.\nOutputs that depend on the number of suns are:  A: Rip B: Crumpled C: Saturated D: One dimensional E: Crumpled\nIn general, I think students should keep their papers inside but in a cool place (like in a book case) and out of the sun. If they have to put them outside outside, just to make sure, they should do it only for a brief time.\nBut for papers which only have one side out of the sun, leave them out under the sun because they will not look good if they are crumpled.\n\nInput:In a month, two boys went to the beach to see a friend.

They each spend the least amount of money each day for reasons that have nothing to do with their money. The most money stays in the right room as long as he does not go outside.\nOutputs based on the number of nights stay out of the money are:  A: $60 from the right room B: $60 from the left room C: $12 from the left room D: $10 from the right room E: $6 total\nThe $6 total does not include the $0 from the boys at the motel.", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

Choose some things, and then choose the ones that look like mushrooms, then choose the ones that don't look like mushrooms, etc. Which ones do look like mushrooms? Which ones do look like plants? Which ones look like mushrooms in some ways, but not in others?\nOutput: For each type of plant, you get a point depending on the variety. If a plant grows with leaves and flowers, but has a stalk instead of a stem, it's a plant. That is, it grows plants. If it grows with leaves and stems, but it grows them in odd rows, there is some variety. You get extra points for the odd rows, but if you add a stalk to each plant in each row, you still get more points. If you grow leaves and stems of the same plant, if you grow leaves or stems of lots of plants in one row, you get more points. So you get bonus points if all your plants grow in the same row. If the plants grow in odd rows, if some plants in the row look like mushrooms or mushrooms look like plants, you get less points. So extra points for variety are given extra weight. So extra points are given extra weight if some of your plants have lots of leaves and stems and some plants have none.\nThis is not a science question, and should be asked on a Biology or Biology Question.

How many hours would you spend making the mailing list?\nOutput:Let x = the total number time you would spend creating the mailing list.\nThe equation for time is x = [x + 1] + 1 = x + 1.\nIf that equation holds, then the final answer is x = 12+1 + 1 = x + 12\nHere\u2019s another equation:\nx + 1 = 12\nx + 1 + 9 = 18\nSo the final answer of this equation is: 18 - 12 = > 0\nIt\u2019s a good idea to add both of these to get the total. The total becomes:\n18 + 12 = > 2\nSo the final answer here is 2 + 2 = > 1\nSubtracting both sides of each equation, we get a total of: 2 + 2 = >>14>>14, so 8 hours to add both sides together.\nSo the final amount to charge is 14/2+2 = >>14/2>4.\n\nInput: An old man is complaining that he needs medicine to stop his diabetes.

{"text": "Choices\nA depressed person may have sadness when they are alone or when they are alone with others. A depressed person usually has more than one mood, which means they may be downcast, sad, angry, etc. Depression is a medical disease. It may affect several body systems.\nA person with depression is usually depressed by his own actions (not by outside circumstances), by his family's problems, by the way people treated him or by his current situation. Some people may feel that they have \"a black spot\" on his heart. They may feel bad inside when it is easy for others to be positive.\nFor a person with depression, it's easier to accept his illness when he's doing well than when he's doing badly. If he sees that someone is glad or happy, happy or sad, it might be easier for him to feel sorry for himself.\nOne of the consequences of a depressed person is that it may put more pressure on the person who is depressed to do well for himself. If you are depressed, it's important to exercise some caution. Don't put yourself under too much pressure to do well, and make a conscious effort to avoid putting yourself under unnecessary pressure.\nIn most cases, depressed people have some control of their feelings or emotions, usually using some kind of medications.\nIf you are feeling depressed, make sure you take time out to do things that don't involve work. Relax, have coffee, take a walk. Try to go to the mall or play a game. Give a talk at the theater or church to your friends, or simply watch TV. Talk to a doctor if you need medical help.\nA depressed or feeling sad person might want to stay up all night, to go to bed early when you're not around, to play a game excessively, to cry, or to become overly pessimistic. One person may want to change his attitude while another may be hoping for the best. To get along peacefully, you all need to be honest and try to get along while being real with each other.\nIf you feel depressed, talk to someone you trust about your feelings. Don't feel that you get a pass for being sad or angry now because you're depressed. Depression is a condition that should not escape treatment. In most cases the only way someone will be cured of depression or other serious mood disorders is if they start taking some kind of anti-depressive medication in a doctor's office every day.\n\nInput: The following is a list of 20 food items found", "answer": "A: depressed"}

{"text": "There is a snake in a burlap sack.\nThe snake burrows into the bag. In the hot country, it eats the potatoes. The purse is a secret hideout. The grass is a way to eat the potatoes when there are not any snakes.\nSo the final output is snake + potato = snake + potato + something else, so potato + snake = snake + potato.\nThe snake is definitely a burlap sack (no pets), the potato is burlap (no bags), and some other things were definitely used (no grass). No snakes, no burlap, no secret hideout, and no potatoes. We get snake + potato = Snake + Burlap Bag.\n\nInput: Adam was given 100 pictures.

They own their apartment, and want to sell it. There is a $500 fee for buying a new apartment in their current building. They sell their current apartment and buy a new apartment that is smaller. The new apartment cost $500 less that their current apartment did, and they now own the $500 less expensive apartment. On July 1, Alice sells the new apartment for $375.00, Robert gives the deposit to Alice, and Bob puts the money in his bank account as Bob deposits the $350 deposit with the bank. Thus, Alice now owns the new apartment that cost $350 less than her current apartment cost, and she now owns a total of $450 that she cannot cash out for at least 4 weeks.\nTo make this happen. Alice and Robert have to divide $25.00 and $350, respectively, each week. Thus, once Robert has paid Bob his deposit ($350), Alice is left with $225.00. As soon as Robert leaves the bank, Alice can finally cash her $225.00 because she no longer owes any money on the $300.00 she now owns. To get $20 of this $225.00, Alice must spend $10.00 each week on gas, groceries, clothes, house cleaning services, and so on. We know that for $10.00, this is $20.00 a week she can spend which is $225.00 of money she has not been entitled to spend. Therefore, Alice spends $225.00 a week for 7.5 weeks to pay for the $125.00 it cost to buy the $200.00 apartment. Her $225.00 was a loan from Bob. She is not entitled to this borrowing of $225.00 from Bob. Why is Alice allowed to borrow from Bob?\nSo, Alice's money is borrowed", "answer": "B: supermarket"}

{"text": "The answer is a: the food place table can live in the cafeteria. it fits perfectly with the space inside the cafeteria and has a bigger footprint than the other table.\nThe cafeteria table does not fit well with the space inside the park as it is placed awkwardly at the side of the cafeteria table, but it does have a bigger footprint than other tables so the food place table will not be moved there. It could also go in the dining room as well, but it will be placed awkwardly. You may have to adjust the height of the table as it is awkward, so it will be too high or too low depending on where you put it. However, the dining table will have a larger footprint than the other pieces and you have to think of that as a good thing. The formal dining room can be used as either the formal dining table or the lunch table. If you go with it, you should adjust the size of the dining table since it can be a bit too big with more people than usual.\nIn the house section, the dining room table is a good candidate for the porch as it does not require much space but still has a bigger footprint than most furniture. The dining room table does not really fit the other furniture in the house very well as it does not have much space there.

Choices: A: cafeteria B: outside C: in the garden D: on the porch E: beside the couch F: in the closet G: underneath the bed\nOutput: The correct solution is c: out on the patio and the dining room table is already there.\nThe dining room table can fit well in the garden section as it does not require any space.

The first task is done in one day. What is the total amount of the tasks before the end of the week?\nOutput:Let x = the total number worked.\nIn the 1st task, Michael worked 60 hours, which is 60/72 = 60 hours, so it took 2 workweeks to complete the 1st task\nIn the second task, Ali worked 5 days, so that was 5/72 = 35/72 = 35 hours\nIn the first task, Lawrence worked 5 workweeks, so that was 5*35 = 105 hours\nIn the 2nd task, Lawrence worked 10 workweeks, so 1 day is 5*105 = 10 hours\nSo the total is 105 * 10 = 105 hours.\nSince we will not count weekends, and we will count each weekday as 3 days, we can compute from this:\n105 + 1110 = 11055\nThus we have 10 / 90 = 10.5 workweeks, which is 10/90 = 8.5 workweeks.\nSince 10 workingweeks are 1/90 of 1 week, 80/90 = 10/90 = 14.75 weeks to complete this task.\n\nInput: In what day did the 1st question of the second block solve?\nOutput: Let o be the answer.\nWhen there are more than 4 blocks (7 for this example) the first question solve on the same day which is not the same day.\nx+12 = (12 + 1) = 10 + 21\nIn the first task there was one day during which we solved the 1st task, which is the reason for x + 12 = 10\nIn the second task there were 4 days which we solved the 2nd task, which is the why for x + 12", "answer": "C: music class"}

How many days in a week would she work?\nOutput: Here, we have both of the following problems. Mary works 5 days a week, 40 hours a week. So how old are these three daughters?\n7 years old = 6\n7 years old = 3\n7 years old = 2\nWe have a problem with the first problem. Mary is working at school, home office, and office (which is a newspaper office). So if she works at school 3 days a week and works 4 days at home and 4 days at office, she will only work 40 hours a week. Since she is working 5 days a week she will only work 40 * 3 + 40 = 100 hours. So we conclude that Mary works about 70 hours per week.\nIf she is working at home 3 days and at school 4 days and at work 5 days, she will not work 70 hours per week, because she can get 5 days off at home 4 days after she works 3 days at home and works 3 days at office.\nIf Mary worked at home 3 days and worked at school 4 days and worked 4 days at office, then she would work 70 hours per week.

The total amount of ink on her rug is: 2*2*2*4/(2^$).  3*2 = $2 for the ink\n3*4 = 10\u00a2 for this rug (6*12)*$2=$16 for ink for a total of$7 for ink on a rug.  Therefore, the total amount of ink on the rug is $16 or 6*$16.  Since the total amount of ink was $16, Sarah's total cost of $16+$15=$16.\nSince the total amount of ink increased by $16, Sarah is actually saving $8 by leaving the old rugs behind the desk.  We can subtract $8 from the number 5 and take those 2 + $8=$2 to get our final number of $2, or total cost of $2 and total cost is $3.

The student misses class on this afternoon to give the teacher a chance to explain the test score.  When the student comes back to class, the teacher is impressed with his or her performance, and the student also impresses the teacher by giving the rest of the class his or her test scores (which were all very similar to the student's score).  The teacher then awards the student a certificate for passing the class.  How many times did the student give his or her scores?\nOutput:  The test scores of everyone in the class ranged from A+.  The teacher gave a certificate to each student based on the test scores.\nWe assume that A+ was an A, and each student was given 2 out of the 8 possible certificates.  Therefore, the student with A grades would have received 8 certificates.\nSo there are 8 certificates = 8*8 = 108 certificates = 108 certificates worth of certificates.  Therefore the test score of 100% = 108 certificates is worth $108 which is $108/8 = 12.9.  This means that the correct answer is 12\n\nInput:  I work for a company that sells electric power.

Let t be the number of hours that the boy and girl can spend writing in a diary before they need to go do something else.\nSince the time for the boy and girl to spend writing in a diary is t/w, in x months x/y months we get\n1 w + t (12)\nwhere u is the age for the boy (9) and y (9) and u/y is the age for the girl (16).\nSince the number of days between 10/01/2013 and 30/31/2013 is 7/31/2013-12/02/2013 and 20/03/2013-01/04/2013, we get\n2 12 + 14 = 42 months = 12/03/2013+(1+31)\nSince the number of years is 10/01/13 to 30/04/2013 times 10/01/13 x 10/01/13, we get\n3 42 + 13 = 60 months = 12/03+30+5 = 12/03/+5+5\nWe can solve for 12 months again, by multiplying (12/03+6) by 42 months, so we get\n4 12+0 = 6/3+12 = 6\nWhich equation do we have for 6/3+12? The value of 6/9 is\n6 / 9 =\nWe can say that x/9(x) = 4, so the average of 2+2=5.5 is\n16 + 25 = 32\nWe solve for 2 + 10 = 42, so 2/x/10 = 15.\n\nInput: Alice, an 11-year-old girl, wants to know the average time a pencil weighs.

The climate in this area is warm and damp; it gets about six inches of rain a winter, usually starting in late November. It is about as cold as the coldest part of the South, but the temperature rises to about 60-70 degrees fahrenheit. The snake hibernates the first part of winter, going into the densest part of the cave.  Each day for six months, the snake leaves these cave entrances in the trees, coming up for hours at a time. It is often seen at dawn in daylight, returning to the cave later in the afternoon, but rarely all night long.  The temperature in the cave reaches 60-80 degrees fahrenheit from midnight through the middle of February.  The snake will wait for several weeks after the temperature rises back up to 40-50 degrees fahrenheit each spring, before using its last cave entrance again.       The snake will remain in its cave until June. The snake is as tall as the tallest tree in this area.  The snake has two holes on each side of its head that are about 3 inches apart. Its color is a medium green color, with black markings on its sides.  Its head is the same size as a large person's average head.  The snake is 1/2 inch long.

You have $6,800 in your 401K(tied to salary) ($24,700 in your Roth, $12,000 in your traditional) and $6,400 in your money market. There's a 7% return. If you buy a house for $30,000 with your home equity of $13,000, your mortgage is equal to $11,400 and principal payments are $1,600. At the interest rate of 6%, your savings account earns 6% (not counting capital gains). For the remaining $3,300, the investment portfolio earns 2.9% (not including interest!) on the amount being invested while the home is being paid off (not including capital gains). Assuming the home is paid off in 4 years, you'll need to save enough for a 10% down payment on the next home. The down payment can be a $15,000 first home, $16,900 second home or $18,800 third home. You can save for the down payment by buying a $1,000 investment bond, saving $360 over the purchase cost with a $150 auto mortgage payment, or saving $10,000 by investing $10,000 more over four years after paying off the first home. In an ideal world, your money would net $11,750 at the end of the time you had $12,300 in debt paying off your $12,300 home ($7,450 home equity with 6% interest and $5,100 principal in principle). Based on the interest rate of the capital markets, you'd need to invest at least $25,800 in real estate. You'd need 25% savings rate", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

{"text": "In the next few hours, the native lemur will be found in A, E and D.\nThis problem requires a little more understanding. The only way to really describe the native lemur is by reference to photos. The Native American tribe that is in the rain forest, called the Lakota Nation, is associated with the animal pictured. Although some tribes had different names and are not associated with the image, the tribal group associated with the animal is still the one used.\nThe question asks you to consider some of the characteristics of the native lemur. First, the lemur is a herbivore. This means that it eats leaves and flowers. It is able to live alone. Another characteristic is that the animal grows to 1.5 meters in length, or 1 foot and a half in width. Its size indicates that it should live in the rain forest, but some scientists believe that the animal will make a new home in the Amazon. The native lemur was given a very small habitat when it was first described. Its environment is small enough that the animal has no chance to spread, causing the animal significant danger. Another important characteristic is that the native lemur is a predator. It eats spiders, mosquitoes, beetles and other insects. Because of its natural behaviors, the native lemur is very difficult for scientists to study.\n\nInput: A and B will both pick a bird on their way to work on Fridays while C will pick only one bird from the same time period\nOutput: Let Y be the number of birds that A and B pick on Friday.\nY = |12| + 10 + 15 + 30\nTotal =\nA + 24 = 36\nB + 24 = 36\nC + 20 = 48\nInput: What is the area of Australia\u2019s coast, in square miles, and how many square miles is the Great Barrier Reef?\nOutput: Using the area of Australia\u2018s coast, as a guide, you will estimate that the Great Barrier Reef is 9.4321 square miles, or 26,851 square miles.\nNow suppose the two questions require you to use something like the diameter of an equator.

The least likely, best, worst, most likely, and most unlikely options are: 1) be eaten 2) be killed 3) be killed by someone with a sharp object, 4) be kept captive for a long time, 5) be returned to the owner, and 6) be thrown in a dumpster.\nLet's take a look at each scenario:\n1) Being eaten (more likely, least likely, best, least likely)\nThe monkey would be killed in an attempt to keep it from escaping. This would mean the person throwing you into a dumpster is trying their best to starve you, because that would make it more likely you would be eaten, and it would make it harder to escape. You would be thrown into what was probably a large group of people eating food and not a single person would be able to grab you, since you aren't as easily picked up. You would probably end up eaten, because it's so unlikely someone will care enough to try to rescue you at that point.\n2) Being killed (more likely, least possible, best, most likely, and unlikely)\nThe monkey may escape somehow. Once it's out of the playground, the animal would find a better place to stay. It's less likely they'll find it in a dumpster than in a playground because it is an animal that has no shelter. It would be more likely they'll be found alive in the wild in case they are found later to be returned. You could be killed if you are chased by too many people, you aren't able to fight back, or you get lost and no one", "answer": "A: utah"}

How far ahead can the vehicle see in front, and thus how long can it keep up with the vehicle?\nOutput: An object traveling at 80 mph should be visible in front of the vehicle for approximately one fourth of its travel, or 2 miles ahead of it. Thus, with the object traveling at 88 mph, the speed limit should be lowered by one second. With the object travelling at 80 mph, the speed limit can only be lowered by one second, or 0.2 mph.

The 20% gain of 20 mph will give the vehicle an apparent 20% advantage over the other vehicles, assuming a head-start of 20 seconds at 55 mph. Thus, the driver should now be able to maintain a speed of 80 mph.

How much money can the other 6 people, in dollars, make?\nOutput: Let y = the total rent Mary and Mary are paying for their house.\nSince Mary and Mary have total rent payments of $3,000 / 5 = $3,000, this gives Mary $0 in rental income this week.\nMary can afford the $3,000 she is earning by moving into a house. She does not need to spend a penny of extra money this week.\nSince Mary made $3,000 from rental income this week, and Mary doesn't need any extra money to buy a house and $1,200 from selling the house she lives in, she makes $1,200.\nMarrying Mary is good for both Mary and Michael. In this two-person example, they split $1,200 each.\nSince Mary didn't spend a penny of extra $1,200, she makes $1200.\nMary can buy a house with $3,000 in her pocket.

Total weight would be: 36 / 6 = 18.18\nNumber of cakes in each half = 6 \u00d7 12 = 24\nNumber of cakes in the larger whole = 6 \u00d7 24 = 36\nTotal weight of cakes = 36+18+36 = 48 \u00d7 24\nTotal weight of cake = 48 \u00d7 24 = 96\nSo the final number of cakes was 96\n\ninput:We have 3 cats and 2 kittens.

Thus, A + 80 = 100, which is 3E + 80 = 100. The total price for the new display ($90) divided by 100 = $40. So we have $40 for Michael's new computer ($60 originally). And we have $40*3E = $80.

He pays $10,000 for a new car and immediately sells it for $6.50 less ($12,500) than he paid ($32,500). He has $10,000+$2,150=$20,000, which is more than he ever made in 10 months, so his total net worth is actually $20,000+$2.150= $34,200\nJohn Smith paid $12,500 for a new car, then immediately sold it for $6.5 less ($12,500+$2,150) than he paid ($40,000). After 10 months, he still paid $6.50 less than he paid for the car, so he has $6.50 less (+$2,150) in his bank account after 10 months than he had before using the money to buy the car.\nSo the answer is $34,200\n\nInput:John Smith makes car payments.

He made two robot legs that can move independently and one robot arm. When the robot arm moves, the robot leg turns, and a new motor kicks in to make the robot leg move again. When Johnny pushes a button on the remote control, a door opens in his robot lab and starts a stream of water that helps his robot move. When he pushes another button, the water stops and the robot stops.\nIn school, Johnny said that he made the robot arm himself. He used Lego blocks to make the robot leg and used magnets and batteries to make the robot arm. He put the leg on a piece of cardboard and tied it to another piece of cardboard. Then he used a piece of cardboard to make a head for the robot leg. He built a small stand to hold all of the pieces. He painted the robot leg with black paint; it looks like a robot wearing black leather shoes. Then he fixed the two arms with yellow plastic legs, which make the robot arm feel heavier. He used a blue power supply to move the arm and a red power controller to move the arm's head.\n\nInput: In the 1980's a local television news station wanted to find a person who could build a 3-D robot.

How much money does Alfred have?\nOutput: Alf knew that his father would give him 1 dollar. He could not know how his father would give him the dollar, but he could guess. So he asked his dad how much his father made. \u201cHow much did you work this week?\u201d he asked. His father replied, \u201cHow many candies did you buy your kids?\u201d\n\u201cYou gave us 200 candy each\u201d Alfred replied.\n\u201cTwo weeks ago they received $50 and $250.\u201d\n\u201cBut, I don't even have to work this week,\u201d Alfred told him.\n\u201cOh, yeah?

He now has $10 to send back to her and $1 to pay off his father.\nSo, Alfred's father doesn't have enough money to pay his granddaughter back, since he lent her $2 to buy gum. What's Alfred to do? He could give her money back, or sell the gum.\nAlfred chooses to sell the gum. If he sold it for $10, he'll have enough money to buy", "answer": "C: bad time"}

{"text": "$1,000 of U.S. currency and $200,000 of U. S gold in the U.S. Treasury account.\nLet x be the total number of U.S dollar coins. If x = 100, then the answer is $1,000.\nSince the U.S. dollar coins must total the number of U.S. dollar bills, the total is 100. Now we compare those numbers to the U.S. Department of Treasury's estimate of U.S. gold held in its gold reserves. The total is $1,000,000, so the total is $1,200,000, giving us $9,000,000 of U. State gold. Let's compare that with the U.S. Commerce Department's estimate of gold held overseas, or $868,000,000. The total is $4,608,000. So the total is the U.S. total including the Commerce Department's estimates of overseas gold reserves. But, that doesn't mean there is $4,608 million of U. States gold in the Reserve. So we need to get the amount of U. States gold from the U.S. Constitution's Declaration of the Inauguration.\nOutput: $1 million of gold equals $100 million of U.S. coinage.\nNow let's use the money from the U.S Treasury to buy that gold for $3,000,000. We go to the Treasury's website and choose the gold option:\n$3,000,000 in gold is purchased. The sum of $200,000 + $2,500,000 + $1,000,500 = $5,000,000. But if we add back U.S. coin currency in proportion to the dollar bill value, the total is $5,000,500. So, now we say the value of U. States gold is $5,000 million, the total foreign reserves are $5.2 billion, and the total gold held abroad is $5.2 billion.

In addition, certain furnaces may not be installed in certain new houses built in the last five years.\nWhat does $10,000 buy you? 2 new ducted models (or ductless) of the same brand, or a new heater, for about $2500.\nIf we ignore the taxes paid on the replacements of the furnace, the total comes out to approximately $11,000*100/year = $11K. Using the inflation calculator, which is updated every 6 months, we can see that an additional 2 air conditioners are actually a waste of money. Also, the replacement parts cost about $1200. In all, we spent about $22,000 on furnace replacements this past year.

So how much money did this first realtor make on the sale?\nOutput: We estimate the total amount the second realtor's realtor made is $50,000.\nThe realtor who sold the second home was paid $15,500. So the realtor that made $100,000 from this sale probably made some additional $10,500 on the realtor who sold the first home.\nSince the total profit was $40,000, we figure $10,500 + $50,000 = $95,500: $95,500 \u2013 $30,500 = $45,500\nThis adds up to $45,500\n\nInput:The company was offering its employees a bonus every 90th pay period.

In column 4, we compute the price for each book: $30, $90, etc. To get the first three numbers in columns 4 and 5, we sum each result: $120, $160, $240, etc., leaving 5 as the result for column 4.

The median of 5 choices is 14, so 4 of the 5 body parts have lips. So, the median of 5 choices is 7, so 3 body parts have 5 or more lips.\nNext, we look if the number of lips exceeds the average of each body part. We can use the distribution of the number of lips as the average. The number of lips that have an average of 5 is 21% of all body parts, so 4 out of the 5 body parts has at least one lip. So, the number of lips that have more than the average of 3 is 2%, so no body part has more than 3 lips.\nWe check for the average of two or more mouth and lips.

In response, students said that since light is emitted from the sun (sunlight), Professor T is wrong. What is the correct answer?\nOutput: Students were talking about sunlight while Professor T was talking about electricity. Now that Professor T has corrected himself, let us review what was said originally:  A: Professor T said he gets his electricity from sunlight B: Student said the sun generates electricity C: Student said that sunlight did not generate electricity D: Student said that Professor T said he gets electricity from the sun\nOutput: The correct answer is B\n\n(This is supposed to be a word association problem, so that you can find the word in the picture.)\n\nInput: The sun has 7 equal length sides. Let x be the length of one side (0 - 1) of the sun. Then we can find a way to have all 7 of the sides equal length based on the number of sides. First, we find that (7/x)=4, so we can find the side with the length of the second number x to be (2/2)=4. Now we can find another way to divide by 3. First, let x = 3 and a = 5, so (3/x)=3/25, so (2/2)=25/25, so (1/5)=25/25. Then we can divide by 2, so (2/25)(3/x)/2=25/25. Now we can divide by 1, so we get (3/3)*(1/x)/1=25/25. Then divide by 2 for the last division, and the final product will be 25.\nThis is how the side length formula for the sun works, and the equations for the other sides' length formula work:\n\nInput: The Earth is round. You can roll the circle as many times as you want to, but at the same time, if you stop all rolling, that will count as 0 days. If you stopped all rolling on December 21, 2015, that would be 0 days. To determine how many days that is, what would be your expected result? Output: You can have as many attempts as you want, just stop rolling once a day on December 21st.\nThe answer is 2 days, so the final answer is 2 days\n\nInput: You wake up one morning", "answer": "C: car show"}

You buy 100 boxes of cookies and 200 pieces of chalk at the dollar store. Let us say you sell those cookies for $1 each. Let V(n) = 2% x(n + 1)...so your net profit is $1. Now let us suppose you open 100 boxes of cookies and sell them for $1 each. You have: $100 * $0.20 = $300\nOutput: Let us say you bought 25 boxes of cookies for $1 each and sold them for $0.20 each. Total net profit is $225 = $300 x 25.\nOutput: So the final answer was\n2 x $225 = 75.5 = 75 dollars x 25 = $150\n\nInput: Alice walks up to five kids at McDonalds and offers to sell the kids a box of frosting for just a nickel.

In his last 3 months, he earned $2000 in earnings.\nWhat was the total amount of earnings that Ali made?\nOutput: We know from his income report that he earned $1450 in three months.\nSince two of these three months earned $1500, Ali earned $1450 + $2000 = $2050.\nSince he earned $1500 in each of the first 3 months, and $1800 in each of the last 3 months, he made $1900+2000 = $2350.\nSo $3500+2000 = $5000.\n\nInput: Which is greater than or equal to: 13.1 x 2 + 2, 19.1 x 9, or 42.81 x 5.1 + 5, or 1.02 x 1.02 + 2.83 + 4.86 + 13.01 + 12.31\nOutput: 1.02 +4.86 +13.01 = 2.01, so 42.79 = 1.02\nSince the answer is 2, let's plug that into the formula to get the question: 1.02 + 4.86 +13.02 = 2.01, which means 1.02 is greater than or equal the answer.

{"text": "We write 1 question and we put ink in each answer box:\nQuestion: What is water?\nAnswer: Water is basically the liquid stuff that you see. Water molecules have 4 charges, with the four most negative charges being towards the end of the molecule. Since the negative charges attract each other, they repel the positively charged molecules. The water molecules that are attracted to the negative charges repel each other.\nWhen you see water, this means that there is more water than air around it. As the air surrounding the water molecules gets smaller and smaller, the water molecules start to move towards the smaller air molecules. When this happens, the water droplets become more and more tightly packed so that they don\u2019t get as much space as they need for their movements. This also means that the air around the water molecules becomes more and more thin, which prevents the water droplets from escaping as easily.\nThe water molecules on the air molecules get closer together and each particle of air has more water than air around them. So the amount of water that is in a single particle of air is greater then the amount of water that would be in an individual particle of air.\nThis leads to the conclusion that there is more water in a single particle of water than air. Therefore, the answer for Question 1 would be: A: squid\nAnswer: E: printer\nB: D: fountain pen\nAnswer: F: printer or F: fountain pen\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInput: A cow and a horse lived on a plain.

She then puts a bracelet of flowers on him and gives it to his best friend; she does not tell him that she gave him that necklace. He steals the bracelet from her bedroom and wears it, so it is a \"witness\". The best friend tells her boyfriend he stole the necklace from her. He goes to the bedroom and finds the necklace with the X on it is missing. When they look in the bedroom in the morning, they find evidence of theft and do an investigation of the place.

{"text": "How many people went to movie theaters during the week?\nOutput: To keep track of how many people watched movies, we just subtract every person's week total from the number of people who visited movie theaters. That is: total movie people (x) - total movie times (y). If movie is number, then x * y * y = total movie times (y/x), where x and y are movie names. So if movie is 6, y is 6+1, y/6 = 6/6 and 6/6+1 = 6/6 + 6/6 * y = 26. Y/26 = 8/26, so 13-13 x 26= 26. That is, 13 / 26 = 11 + 12 = 16. So we subtract 26 from 26 to arrive at 17. So we know that if movie was 3 on Thursday, then x * y / 3 = 3, so movie times were on a weekday: 11 + 3 = 16. So movie times for the week ending December 31 were: 5 on Thursday; and 10 on Friday + 11 on Saturday + 7 on Sunday = 17. So movie theaters had 17 visits per week.

So that gives us 24 minutes of available time which we can use. And since that's not enough, we can divide that by (3 * 1), and get a new \"Hour\". So, this gives us 36 minutes of available time. So since we are at 1:30 on Tuesday, the amount of available time for this week is 36 minutes. So that leaves us 12 minutes of available time to use over the next few days. So we add those 12 minutes to our \"Hour\".\nInput: At 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the minute in the day reached 1 minute. How many seconds did you have available to use?\nOutputs: To estimate how many seconds I had available, I divided 12 by (8 * 1). So how many seconds would I have had if we added all the seconds in the day together? So 24 / 8 = 11. So I used that number to get seconds. So since at 1 p.m", "answer": "D: theater"}

How much would he spend, for each item, if he goes to McDonalds for the items?\nOutput: We find the total price for a drink plus the purchase of an item divided by $20, so $20 = $<<20+$20+$5=60>>60.\nSince 60 / (20 -$5) = 16, we find $60 = $<<16<-40>>16.\nSo we get $60 + $16 = $<<16<$40>>16.\nSince we bought a drink and had an extra $5, we got $160.\nSo the final price was ($160 * $20)/$20 = $<<16<40>>16>160.\nSo the total price, in dollars, was $160 - $5 = $<<16<>40>>160.\nSince we spent $160 for all 4 items, the total price was $160 + $5 = $<<26<>40>>260.\nSo the final total for a drink + an item was $170.\nSo the final per-drink price was $170.\nThe total per-item price is $155 ------------------------+\nSo your final answer is 25\n\nInput: A salesman is selling shoes at a retail store. An average woman spends 60 seconds shopping in the store. A typical man spends 5 seconds. He buys 12 pairs of shoes, for a total of $20. How many pairs of shoes is he going to buy?\nOutput: He adds 12 shoes to his total. That means that he has to buy 2 new pairs of shoes. To divide 6 pairs into 2 pairs, we use 4 x 8 = 16. Since 16 = $40, and $40 * $10 = $20, we have $20 + $80 = $80.\nSince we need $20, we can only buy 2 pairs of shoes.  So he buys 1 pair for $10 and 1 pair for $12.  Now he has 12 pairs and a total of $80 for the shoes.\nSince we only have $80 for the shoes, we get 11 pairs. Because we need to buy 2 pairs of shoes to get the total number of shoes, we get 4 pairs.

The book only sold 5 copies and had very low reviews. The author of the second book made $102,000 selling 100,000 copies at the age of 26.

So at age 22 he made $8,000 for the first book and $40,000+$52,000 for the second book. So his annual earnings are: $56,000 for the first ($2,000) and $10,000 ($4,000) for the second ($8,000).\nSo the final answer for the first book is $2,000.\nThe author of the second book's final book made $10,020,000. So the books combined earnings are: $20,000+$80,020,000=$80,000,000, or $80,000 per year.\nSo the final answers for both books make $20,000+80,040,000, or $50,000 per year\n\nInput: The city is Chicago.

Calculate the diameter of a regular golf.\nOutput: The diameter of the ordinary golf ball is: 1.75 inches = 11 x 11 = 19 x 19 x 19 = 29 x 29\nSince we need to find the average circumference of a regular golf ball we only need to ask: how many balls are 1.75 inches?\nWe find the average circumference of the regular golf ball is: 12.75 inches = 35 x 36 = 89 x 89 x 89 x 89\nWe also need to determine what number of inches the large, medium, and small golf balls are the diameter of. We need to find the average of both of these: 1.75 inches x 35 = 9 x 9 x 9 = 21 x 21 x 21\nSo the average diameter of the large golf ball is 20.75 inches, the average diameter of the medium golf ball is 19.75 inches, and the average diameter of the small golf ball is 15.75 inches.\n\nInput: Alice, who has been friends with George for 10 years, was invited for an overnight vacation in her boyfriend, Jason's, hotel room.

{"text": "The best way to ice fish Michigan is to use a lake with deep enough water depths to support ice fishing equipment. Michigan's great lakes hold an estimated 22 billion pounds of water. Michigan has an estimated average of 32,400 square miles of frozen lakes.\nMichigan's great lakes are not far out from us in the summer. However, that doesn't mean that Michigan's lakes cannot be ice fished in the winter. Lake Superior has a mean depth of 14 feet; in other words, it is deep enough below the surface that you can find the ice fishing opportunity in almost any month of the year. The best area for ice fishing in Michigan in the winter is Lake Michigan's Icefields; the Icefields are open to the north shore and to the south shore from about the first week of December through early March.\nLake Erie is a much larger and deeper body of water than either Lake Superior or Lake Michigan. Lake Erie has 22.9 billion pounds of water and has an average depth of 31 feet; in other words it is much less deep than the other lakes cited. It allows fishing from July until the end of fall (November to April) in winter.\nLake Huron is the widest body of water in Michigan. Lake Huron's average depth is about 28 feet and it has a mean depth of 15 feet. The shallow waters of Lake Huron contain enough ice over enough of the surface area to support ice fishing equipment, and the ice on the deeper waters is not as deep as the ice in the lakes of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New England, and Canada. Ice quality is always variable on Lake Huron. Ice fishing for walleyes in the winter is possible in summer, but walleyes fishing in winter can be really good, especially along shorelines where the ice has remained in place for several weeks.\n\nInput: On June 22, 2010, three women went fishing with a gun on their wrist and two men on their inner thigh.

The money will pay for books, transportation, tuition, and fees. How many books would the best student buy at the school if they paid the price of the books? Output: We look first for total tuition cost from each college: $37.95 = $9,000. If the total cost is that great, how much should the student write on their student loans? (This is equivalent to asking the best student to save $37.95 per day for 10 years). If the total cost includes textbooks for the rest of the time the student is working there, subtract that from $9,000 + 2nd term costs. Total = $11,000\nSubtracted from $11,000, total loans cost $7,000, so we need to subtract $4,000 from total tuition and fees to get $6000: $6000 \u2013 $4,000 = $47.75\nSubtracted from [11,000 \u2013 $37.95 \u2013 $11,000] = $30.50\nWe now need to multiply the sum by the total number of books the student purchases: $6,000 + $6,000 \u2013 [37.95 \u2013 $9,000] = $24,150, resulting in the total amount of books the student should save for college. Now we look first for student loans: there are 2 students: 1) Who has $10,000 in student loans (or $10,000 from a scholarship, which is the same thing)?  2) Who has $12,000 in student loans?\nSubtracted from 20, $10,000 = $7,500\nAdd $7,500 to the amount of student loans the student has, leaving a loan balance of $13,000, so he has $15,000 in student loans.\nTotal = $19,000\nSubtract [20, 10, 15] = [7, 500 \u2013 $13,000] = [12, 500 \u2013 15,000] = 7,500\nTotal loan = $28,000\nSubtraction [30, 15], [15, 0] = [8, 50 \u2013 [15, 2] \u2013 (15 \u2013 9) \u2013 (12 \u2013 5)] = [8, 100 \u2013 [15 \u2013 2] \u2013 (15 - 21", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

Each distance, the statue would be higher or lower than the last, and vice versa. Suppose the statue was a fixed height from the last, and the last was never below the statue. What are the following distances to the statue?\nOutput: The statue is always the same height in all instances.\nSince the statue is always the same size from all locations, it becomes a line going from one point to the other.\nThus we are forced to use a formula so as to find the area of the triangle that connects the three points where the statue is located.\nWe need to find the area of a triangle from (x 1, x 2,..., x n-1) to (x 1, x x-1,..., x n-n-1).\nLet a = a(x 1 + x 2,..., x 2,...n - 1) = b. Thus a = a(x-1)*b= a\nThus a = 1 x + b\nThus b = a\u00b2 x + 1x + b\nThus a = 1/a\u00b2 x + b\u00b2\nThus a = x x + 1\nSo we use: a\u00b2 x + b\u00b2 = a2\nThus a\u00b2 x = 1\nSince b = 1, we end up with a x = 1 x + 1 = 1/1\nThus a = x-1*1/1 = 1.\nThus b = 1\nThus 1\nSo a = 1\nSo a = 10\nThus a = 10/10 = 1.5\nThus b = 1/10*10\nThus b = 1*1\nThus 1*10 = 1\nThus 10 = 10\nThus 10 = 10/10 = 10\nThus 10*10 = 0.5\nThus 1*10\nThus 10/0 = 0.5\nSo a = 10*0.5 = 2.5\nThus a = 20\nThus 1\n\nInput: This week, the museum displayed 3 sets of 2 giant elephants on display; one on a pedestal at the top of the staircase, one at the front of the hall, and one in the middle.

For the remaining 2 hours, she worked for 2 hours. How much money did she lose this week?\nOutput : 6.\nSince 8 hours = 2 * 4 = 16 hours and 12 hours = 8 * 4 = 36 hours, her earnings would be 4* 12*16 = 36 * 5, which is about $4.80.\nSince $4 does not last long enough for her to want to put it aside, Jane spent her time buying treats and toys. She also bought a drink. Based on this, we can estimate that Jane lost $4.80\nThe final answer is 36\n\nInput: Anastasia was in front of the mall store, and her son went straight ahead.

This has prompted the Federal government to set aside $20 billion for the reservoir's construction. It will be   10 times the size of the reservoir already in operation. This reservoir will be named \u201cLake Union,\u201d in memory of one of the Corps' first dam officials. The lake will only be open for five to ten days a year. In the event that Lake Union floods, it will spill at least one third of its capacity. Which would more likely happen: > an increase in annual flood levels in Seattle's rivers and streams, or more frequent flooding of Puget Sound itself?\nOutput: It is likely that an increase in flood levels would result in a decline in Puget Sound itself.\nThe Army Corps plans to open Lake Union two weeks after opening its primary lake, Lake Monroe, so that the  spillway can be put in service promptly in case Lake Union rises to flood level. Lake Monroe is projected to be fully filled by the end of 2000, and Lake Union to be filled with water mid-2003.\n\nInput: In 1997, the state of Ohio proposed to build a sewage facility at the Cleveland-Elyria Metropolitan Sewer District. The cost of the project (which included installing an existing sewer line  and adding a new sewer line) was estimated at $12 billion.

This proposal would make the Ohio Department of Transportation a partner in the project rather than a contractor. In April 2003, Ohio Secretary of Transportation John Schmitt announced that the state was dropping its effort to build a sewage facility. The government estimated that building the project, no matter who built it, would cost no more than $7.5 billion.\nInput: The government also estimated that a sewage facility would cost more than $7.6 billion, but would cost less than $11.3 billion if the department built the project or if the company built it.

How can he do this?\nOutput: Write down the security methods Michael can use and then work backwards from the list of possible methods.\nIf we want to work backwards from possible methods, the first method we can think of is to use some kind of firewalls or virus protection.\nIn IBM computer systems, there are many different ways a user can make a modification to the system. By modifying a system, a hacker can make access to other parts of the system impossible.\nSo for example, if you wanted to hack into IBM's accounting computer system, you could use the possibility of making other people changes to their system as well. With that method, you could potentially be able to change how IBM makes their accounting transactions look, as well as how people use the accounting system itself. So there are many different ways to hack into IBM's computer system.\nMichael is an accountant who makes changes to IBM's accounting system. Each month, he calculates and records company and personal income tax accounts for the company. He also writes down stock transactions during each month and records stock accounts of customers for the company as a whole. He can change the income amounts he creates in the computer system to any value he wants since he uses the accounting system to make that change. All Michael has to do with this is change numbers. He wouldn't need to hack into every single part of the system and see if, or how, it may have been tampered with. IBM's accounting and security systems can block these attacks, but, even if they were broken, it would take an entire year to make the changes back up completely. Michael's best option would be to find a way to create code that won't change, but will still allow IBM to recognize and prevent those who try to hack into the system.\nSo the answer is", "answer": "A: loss of heat"}

Choices: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25\nOutput: Choices : 1.0, 2.2, 5.4, 8.2, 15.0, 25.0\nAfter playing several games, the initial amount of coins is: 1 = A, 2.0 = B, 3.0 = C, 4.0 = D and 5.4 = E. With the last three combinations, the next game is decided as follows: 8 = = A, 4 = = C, 7 = = E. With these six combinations, each game gives an equal number of coins. Since each game gives an equal total, this means that each total equals to: [(8 +(2+10) + 7 + 8) +(2+10)] + [(8 +2 + 2) + 7 + 8)] = [(8 +2 + 5) + 7 + 8] = [(8 +5 + 5) + 7 - 1)] = [(8 +10 + 10) + 7 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 10] = [(16 +1) + 1) + (5 + 2) + (2 + 10)] = [(8 +(10 +1)) + 0) + 2 + 0 + 1] = [(8 + (1 + 10)) + 0) + 1 + 1] = [(16 + 0) + 0) + 1] + 1 + 1 + 1] * (1 + 1 + 1) * (1 + 1 - 1) = [(16 + 1) + 1) + 1 + (2 + (2 + 10) - 5 + 7) + 10] * (2 + (2 - 10) - 3)\nConclusion: For a round of slot machines, every possible combination of coin pays a fixed percentage. For an 18-card set, if the numbers on a card are the same as a coin, a coin is paid twice before the card is given away. Also, if playing at different densities, the results may differ slightly. Hence, for an 18-card set to play the same game, 18 numbers must be the same on the 21st coin from a card to play the same game. If at high densities, you might get", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

In order to check what the students had typed in on-screen and what we typed in on-screen when they entered their answer, we had a \"Find\" button on the top right of the worksheet so students could simply type that answer into the \"Find\" field. This also helped with getting the answers that the students were looking for.\n\nBelow are each of the 2 worksheets.\nBoth worksheets have 15 questions.

The sun comes up every day and sets every night. 2. People work 7 hours a day. 3. People work 7 hours every day for the first four months of a new year. 4. People die every day. 1) Do not look at the table. The answer is D\nLet (n^4+5) be the number of people born alive yesterday. (n = 12, 7, 7) is the number of new babies born yesterday.\nSuppose you know that the first 4 months of a new year has an average of 4 deaths every day.

Next round, let n be the number of new people born last week. Then you know that n x 2 = 52, and the average will be 54. Round 5 will be that same answer.\nThen let n be the number who die this week. Then you know n x 2 = 41, and the average will number 41. Round 7 will be that same answer and round 11 will be that exact same answer as round 6.\nSince (n^4+ 5)^2 = 52, n + 41 = 60.

He did his best but it was very difficult because they were so close and because his hands couldn't reach them. But then a friend of his came up to them and asked if they'd like someone to wipe their bare feet for them, and they said \"Certainly\", and got into the car with Jules. All the while Fred was standing there with his back to the car, so they knew that he was watching them. Finally, they all finished wiping Fred and Corey's bare feet and ran to the car from the parade. They got in and Fred said that the oil made them feel funny too.\nSo the final solution is that Corey and Fred had to wait for Fred to wipe them for them.", "answer": "A: pub"}

He put the pan's cooking surface right side up, so that if a fly landed in front of it, it would be able to hit it. This way, it would be able, if necessary, to hit the fly with its bill.\nMike was going to cook a piece of toast with the frying pan \"right side up,\" but he forgot to do it on the first try. So he used his hands to cook the toast, and then he put the frying pan on the table, so it wouldn't hit him. He also left a plastic cup where the tray had once been, so that it wouldn't hit him as well.\nWhen Mike finally got the toast cooked in the frying pan, he was surprised that the batter was wet when he put it into the frying pan. The batter was wet because that's how Mike cooked food.\nThen Mike went outside to cool down, and a fly landed on him! Michael flew backwards and got hit. The fly was so high, that it didn't go anywhere near Mike! He was able to jump high and land on his feet. But then the fly flew away. It never hit Mike again.\nMike ate some more toast, because, according to Chef Bob, \"If I only eat toast, how will I feed myself?\"\nSo Mike had 2 pieces of toast each. When he ate 2 pieces, he was able to eat 2/3 of a loaf of bread, which then allowed him to have 2/3 of a sandwich, which then allowed him 3/3 of a snack, which then could feed him for another whole day!\nIf you can't cook, it doesn't matter if you buy a frying pan or you buy a frying pan. But if you only buy a frying pan, then don't bother using it! Just put it where you normally put your cups and trays, and you'll be safe. And if it rains, it will never hit you!\n\nInput: A is playing a game where he has to take 2 cards from his deck and then flip them over, showing the face cards of the deck.

How will Alice know how to ask Mary to add 1.25 times?\nOutput: We find that the addition 1.25 time is 9x3 = 9x6 = 9x11.\nThis will give us an addition 1.25 * 9 = 9x10 so that: adding 1.25 times to 10 = 5.\nIt will give us a 10x7 = 10x9 = 10x12 = 10x15 so that: 10x 7.5 = 10x9.5 = 10x12\nSo that is a difference (5*2) of 11 so the total result is 1110 = 9x11 X 1.", "answer": "D: school grade"}

In addition, the time between the emergency call center and Officer A arriving is also less.\nOutput: With the fire alarm, a lot of firemen will be on their way to the alarm within a few minutes. Also, the time between the alarm center in the last incident and the fire department arriving is less. With the police officer, the time between the first call center call and the first officer on the scene is a little longer.\n\nInput:Calculate the probability that there would be a false fire alarm at 7:30 am and 3:30 pm and a real fire alarm at 8:00 am.\nOutput:A big fire alarm that takes a while will not send the fire crew looking for real fires, so the fire department will send one firefighter a minute or so for a real fire alarm. Thus the time between the alarm and the first fire engine is short (about 30 seconds) compared to the average. However, false alarms (3:30 pm) cause a bigger crowd to gather, so the firefighters go very slowly. For a real fire at 8:00, a big fire alarm, it takes 1 fire engine a minute or so to search the building. Thus the time between false alarms and the second fire engine is even shorter.\n\nInput:Michael came into the store and saw that a customer was out.

Which is greater?\nOutput: It is difficult to figure out a day comparison problem from a question such as this, since it is impossible to compare the days of different people. But a general rule of thumb can be derived:\n* The larger the number of sales for a day, the busier the place will be.\n* The smaller the number of sales for the day, the less traffic there will be.\nTherefore, the larger the number of sales from the days of week and the lesser the number of sales from weekends, the less busy the place will be during the day. But this rule of thumb can only be applied with extreme precision. There may be some variation between what will be considered busy on different days of the week, for example weekend shoppers may be expected to do a larger number of sales on Friday than on Saturday or Sunday. This is a difficult situation to predict. The only reasonable way to determine busier/busier times of the week would be to estimate numbers from observed trends. Because this is a mathematical problem it is not possible to use data from sales and population figures, and therefore it is practically impossible to determine which days would be busier/busier.\n\nInput: The family can\u2019t afford a tree for christmas so they sell a birdhouse for $10 instead.

The only thing in each place that was the same was John, so he is just taking some time away from studying, making it less useful than having it in a place where he can be more specific.

It would be interesting if Mary Lou eats an apple now, and then eats another apple at the same time.\nIf three apples turn into two pears, then three more apples turns into three pears. Mary Lou eats five apples and eats two pears, then all her remaining apples turn into pears. This is how much one apple turns into five peaches: five apples turn into five pear halves.\nShe eats the first apple and then the second. Since her remaining apple becomes one pear, it would always turn into four peaches. She eats all her remaining pears. Since her remaining apple turns into a pea, it would always turn a peach. Mary Lou eats one apple, then all her remaining peaches turn into 2 peaches.

Mary Lou gets 6 peas, 1 apple, 5 pears, 2 pears, and 3 peaches.\nSo she got 4^12 = 96 pears, 4^12 = 96 apples, 4^16 = 96 apples and 4^32 = 96 peaches.\nThis gives her 96 pears, 25 apples, and 64 peaches for $32.", "answer": "A: shelf"}

He also has a vacation home in Florida, and a vacation home in California. John makes $15,500 for a six month vacation. For each of those vacations, he contributes $100 each month to his company's retirement plan. For each of those retirement plans, he contributes $2,500 of his vacation fund (and $750 per month or 5%) until he reaches the retirement age of 60. He then decides which year he wants to start saving for retirement. If he saves $10,000 per year, by the time he is 60, he will have contributed an additional $9,000 to his retirement plan. If he saves $1,000 a month, by the time he turns 60, he will have saved $1,000. The total amount of money he contributed to his retirement plan at the beginning of each year will eventually total $24,000.

You only need three people to complete it, but at least seven people are required to complete it. Answer: The number of people necessary to complete the task depends on the task. One job is different depending on the situation, so the answer of the question is different for each situation. The answer may depend on what it is that the task requires.\nSo let x = number of people needed to reach the goal.

Thus, the answer is 3/3\nSince the total distance is 3, the number of people needed is therefore 2 + 9 = 33\nSo the final answer should be 33\nExample\nSuppose John and Bob start at the right from the building.

You sleep while dreaming and wake up soon afterwards.\nNote: At the rate we talk about sleep (we should call these \"sleep periods\"), it has a chance to become \"deep sleep\" about every 15 minutes. This sleep length changes over time so that it's a variable of choice.\nMore still on that topic, we've said \"sleep has a chance to become deep sleep\" about 100 times in a 24-hour period, but only about 90 of those times in the beginning of a period. This isn't as bad as it sounds; our memory of the time is slightly skewed but only by a small amount.\nSo, to summarize: our chances for waking up easily in the early AM or in the early PM are low at best; however, that's a small percentage of the potential to wake up easily.\nMore on where the body goes to sleep and how much time people need for deep sleep:\nThe body doesn't go to sleep in a linear way. The stages of sleep are:\nStage (A): deep sleep Stage (B): light sleep Stage (C): light sleep Stage (D): deep sleep Stage (E): light sleep Stage (F): light sleep Stage (G): light sleep Stage (H): deep sleep Stage (I): alertness Stage (J): wakefulness\nAs described above, sleep is very", "answer": "E: conscious"}

You have one room in your house divided into separate apartments. What kind of house would you build around this room?\nOutput: We begin by asking what kind of house a couple would build around his/her apartment. If the couple build a normal house around the other room, then the apartment can look like one big room. However, if they built a tiny house, the apartment and the other room would both be tiny, so we ask what kind of house the couple's parents will build inside the tiny apartment.\nInput: What kind of house would your house be?\nOutput: The couple's house has two main rooms. In the first room, there is a hallway. Inside the hallway, there are three bedrooms, three bathroom, and one livingroom. Outside the hallway, you can imagine two doors. You could imagine them opening inside another door. The second door would be an entrance. This doorway would open into a living room. Then you imagine a hallway. Here, you could imagine a kitchen. That is where the people would eat breakfast. Next, there is another hallway, but instead of just two bedrooms and two bathrooms, you imagine it had a bedroom and a bathroom each. And the last hallway leads to the bathroom. That bathroom is only for people taking showers. In the last hallway, you could see your house. Your house would have four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and three livingrooms. And the most important part of the house, would be the door to your bedroom. That door would be one big door.

If Michael makes $60 from selling the 2 large birdhouses on Saturday, Mary and Brian would each get $33 from Michael's sales on Sunday. What do you think each couple would each spend on Sunday, on average?\nOutput: We don't know what each couple spends on Sunday, let's say that Mary and Brian spend $20 each on food and Michael makes $15 from selling the two large birdhouses. Let's suppose that Mary and Brian buy a gift certificate to a local restaurant for $60. Let's also suppose that Michael and Mary make $90 from his birdhouse sales. Let's suppose that each couple spends $40 on food, so that they each end up spending $40+$90= $115 on food total this weekend. So Mary and Brian would each spend $115, giving them an 8-pack of soda on Sunday. So let's say that Mary buys candy for her children. That adds up to $115 for each couple for the rest of the weekend. So Mary andBrian spend $115 on candy, and Michael makes $60 from his birdhouse sales, so Mary and Brian end up spending $115 on chocolate as well. So Michael makes $60 this weekend, giving them a total of $160 on candy. So Mary and Brian spend $160 during their weekend, giving them $160 total ($125 from Michael's birdhouse sales and $80 for Mary and Brian combined). So Mary and Brian spend their entire $160 on food during their weekend. So the final total between the two couples is $110, giving them $115 total for the weekend.

{"text": "A * B = (A + B) / 2 = 1 so yellow is unfriendly, brave is not and English carrier is not\nSo the final answer 1\n\nIn this paper I will discuss how money flow is organized in the US and how the interest rate and the value of the dollar (money supply or monetary system) affects this. Monetary supply is money and the supply changes as a result of government decisions that affect monetary value. In order to understand these differences you will need to be familiar and understand the concepts of money and interest rate.\nMoney is the most important component used to purchase and exchange goods and services. It is created by governments and businesses which use this money to purchase and exchange goods/services. The value of the money is related to the interest rate. The interest rate affects how much the money is worth because the higher the interest rate, the higher the worth of each dollar of money. There are 5 factors that affect the rate of interest that are discussed. Supply and demand, interest rates in the major markets (us Federal reserve), inflationary and deflationary periods, foreign currency, and interest rates are used to change the interest rate.\nThe supply of money and interest rate (money supply or money system) have two different components. Most of the money that is used today comes from the Federal Reserve. Since the money supply is very important, it is important to understand how the money supply, money system, and interest rate are related.\nThe money supply is the total amount of money in circulation. It represents the dollar amount that is in circulation. The amount of money in circulation is affected by inflation and deflation and different types of inflation.\nSince the Federal Reserve influences prices through its purchasing power, a high supply of dollars and the Federal Reserve's purchasing power are very important.\nSince the government of the United States controls the interest rate, governments can influence the amount of money in circulation through monetary policies. Inflationary periods increase the money supply because consumers and businesses have more money to spend. Deflationary periods decrease the amount of money in the economy because there is less money being spent. A rise in government spending can increase the money supply. Deflationary periods can decrease the amount of available dollars, since businesses and consumers do not have as much money to spend the money.\nThe value of the dollar is affected by three factors. Monetary demand the amount of money consumers and businesses spend is directly linked to the value of the Dollar. Money supply inflation and interest rate control inflation in the dollar", "answer": "A: fearless"}

It would have fled from the pond and the fly would have made its new home.\nOutput:If the fish has a speed of 2m/s and travels the equivalent of 2.05 seconds to reach the end of the pond, then the dragonfly has traveled for 1.85 seconds\ny = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 3\nif (dragonfly can fly at 0/200 ms/s) then y = 2\nIf the fish is 0/200 ms/ s and reaches the end of the pond in 25 ms, then the dragonfly had passed in 5 ms. In that case, its speed was 0/200 /25=0.5 ms; therefore we do not know its actual speed. For clarity, we can calculate the distance over which the fish travelled from the starting point.\ny = 3.5 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 100 = 2.2 meters\nSo the time it took the fish to reach the end is 3.5 meters, or 2.2 \u00d7 100 / 25 = 0.5 ms.\nThe sum of the times is 4.5 meters.

So our next question is:\n<$50> + <$200> + <$100> = $150\nSince $150/$150 is $200 times 3.7, we get: $200/3.7 = $200\nSo the total cost of the equipment is:\n$200 - $200 = $250\nSo the final question is:\n<250> + <$100>>>= $200\nSo the final question this week is:\n<200>+ <$100>>> = $50\nSo $50 minus $50 = $5 in this case\nSo the final guess, for this week at: $5\n\nInput: There are four men in a house with guns.

The population on Saturday was 700 and Sunday 500. How many chickens were raised? Output: We take the number of chickens per farm on Saturday/Sunday and multiply it by 50.\n5 * 50 = 10,000 chickens\nSo the number of chickens per person on Saturday was 70 (2.5*70 = 14), while it was 60 on Sunday (2.4*60 = 12). So the total number of chickens raised was 10,200.\nNow, to compare Sunday's number to Saturday:\nSaturday = 12 * 100 + 10 = 60\nSunday = 60 + 10 + 30 = 100\nSo the number of the chickens raised was:\n10,200 - 6,000 = 8,000\nNow, we compare how many people ate food on Sunday versus Saturday:\nOn Saturday: 30 people ate food\nOn Sunday: 50 people ate food\nSo, the total number of people eating food on Saturday was: 30 + 40 + 30 = 70\nOn Sunday, we are at 200 people eating food.

{"text": "It can't be either or.

This week, however, we saw the temperature drop very quickly, so the average value is to cool down quickly.\n\nThis week, we saw that the average temperature fell very quickly and dropped to -15 F, which puts the temperature into C.\nSo C is negative 15 F, and since negative 15 F puts the temperature into D, we see the rate of the falling rate increased, so it is increasing faster.\n\nSo if we take the rate of the fall and divide by the rate of heat-up rate, we get the rate of heat-ups per second. And since every second the rate of fall is -10*(-10*(-42*([-1*(12*(3*10)/5*1))))/5), we can see that the rate of heat- ups per second doubles every second, so we see that this week, the first rate double every four seconds, so the difference in rate between the first rate increases and the second rate decreases every 4 seconds, so this week we saw that the first rate doubles every eight seconds!\n\nSo then, the result is double the rate in every 24 seconds, and every 32 second, there is a double rate!\nSo the final answer for this week was double. This week, the daily gain from the heat-up rate was positive, so it was negative two hours!\n\nInput: We go to a store in which we buy 3 gallons of milk.

Both of the cars turn the wrong way and continue their journey around the corner. On the other corner, a woman walks and a man drives, and then both of the men walk. Since the man drove straight up the street and the car drove straight down, all of the roads did not turn, but only the man's and the woman's roads did, so the men did not go around the block together.\nInput: Let's say there are 5 people, the car is a taxi, the cars are all straight, there are 5 intersections and 3 exits, and the car can only move 6 blocks.

One player is in the other end, but not in the middle. Players who are on either end must decide whether to throw their shoes into the field or not. Which players will throw their shoes and which will not?\nOutput: If one player throws their shoe, all players will then either throw their shoes out of the half court or into the court.\nIf one player does not throw their shoe, any player on the other side can go on to the next turn, while the other player waits for someone else to throw their shoe.\nIf one player throws their shoe and passes the ball to the other player, those two players will pass the ball to one more player, until only one player remains.\nIf one player misses their shoe and the other player catches it, that player must keep the shoe until after the other player picks it up.\nIf one player tosses their shoe and the other does not catch the shoe, both parties will keep the shoe until one player tosses theirs and the other throws theirs.\n\nInput: In February 1992, the United States experienced a shortage of fresh foods that lasted 4 years (12 months).

He can stay put and just be run over by the car even if he does not go out that way, but if he runs to safety immediately the car will be unlikely to hit him. If, however, he ran to safety after the car came near him, the car will still likely be unable to hit him. Explain why.\nOutput: If Mike runs to safety, the car can still hit him if it hit him before, but he will be less likely to get hit that way.\nIf you can not run to safety immediately, you will likely still be run over by the moving vehicle.\nThis is very similar to the situation if you are stuck in the middle of a road with no place to run. What is different about this is that the car is unlikely to hit you if you run to safety, but it is still likely to hit you if you are trying to run to safety. So in this case you are still very likely to be run over by the speeding vehicle.\nWhat are the consequences of running to safety after a car hits you?\nThe worst possible consequence is that you may be killed and have to live with the guilt of your choice. You have the option of going to jail for a few weeks or spending the rest of your life thinking about how you could have avoided being run over. Both, however, seem equally bad so make the one that you feel is worst.\n\nInput:The school's cafeteria needs a new vending machine.

The answer is the space shuttle, due to its proximity to water, and the fact that humans are most comfortable when sitting in the water.\nInput: Ali, in her room, is sitting in a bathtub with a hot water bottle. She does water exercises to warm up and cool down. She has a 2.5 litre water bottle filled with water. Her friends, George, Dave, Kelly and Nicky, sit in their chairs and share a drink of hot water, then each move to the bathtub to take a hot shower. George, Nicky and Dave fill their bottles with water and drink, while Kelly and Ali stand in front of their sinks. Over time, George, Dave, and Nicky will drink more and more water from Ali's large water bottle. So, George, Nicky, and Dave each need 2 liters of water to drink in order to cover their combined needs. Ali needs 5 liters of water to cover her needs. So to estimate the total number of gallons drawn, we are going to divide the amount George, Dave, and Nicholas drink daily by 5 \u2013 5 = 5. So we need 5 l = 100 g = 500 ml. So Ali's daily needs are 5% = 500 ml * 500 ml = 100 g / 500 ml = 500 / 500 ml = 500 ml\nOutput: Let g = the average daily need for water across the group of three friends, 5 l = 100 g * 5 l = 500 ml.\n\nInput:The water in the bottle has a specific temperature of 75 \u00b0F.

One place has only 1 table and the other has 2 tables, with 3 tables in between each. One person eats at one table, while the other eats at the other table. Which type of restaurant will a person be eating at each time?\nOutput: We need to know the quantity to calculate the cost. So, we calculate the cost of each dish and divide it by the total number of meals in the restaurant. We then determine if there is any difference based on which table is ordered. In general, the restaurant that has fewer tables (e.g. the one with 2 tables) always needs to serve more customers. The other restaurant will always serve fewer customers. The total number of meals will therefore not change from meal to meal even if there are 2 tables placed on the same level and 3 tables placed in between tables. A person ordered dinner 3 times, so the table that he ate at has a total of 4 meals served.\nInput: A person had a job at 2 different restaurants.

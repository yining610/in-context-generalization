The wedding party went on a sightseeing tour of the city and found a restaurant that they wanted to try. The waitstaff insisted that Alice order the fish for Jerry. Alice decided to say no because she was afraid that Jerry would like the fish much more than her and she thought it was rude to do that, so she asked Bill to do it. In order for Bill to eat the fish, he was going to have to show some skin. Therefore, he came up with a way to show some skin… He bought a pair of jeans from the sales rack. Instead of wearing the jeans, he put a hole in the crotch and a pocket in the top of the leg. Once he went back to the restaurant to get the fish, the waiter told them that Jerry would probably like the fish better if he ordered the salmon because he would be able to see how much skin he had. When Bill ordered fish, the waiter called Jerry from the back room to ask him which fish he wanted. Before Bill could answer the waiter, David asked for the salmon. David knew that Jerry likes to look at the belly, so when the waiter called him back to get the salmon, David told Jerry to ask the waiter for the belly. Eventually, the waitress brought the salmon, and Jerry chose the belly for himself! The waiter asked David why he chose the belly… David was confused. Then, the waiter asked Bill what he would like to eat. Then, the waiter told them about giving the belly to someone with more skin and asked David what his preference was… David had no idea what the waiter was talking about. Finally, the waitress came back to the table to remind David what the other people wanted, so David said he wanted to keep the belly. When asked why he asked for the belly, David told the waiter that he was worried about Jerry’s opinion of him. The waiter said that Jerry is usually the one to give the belly and he couldn’t stand to see Jerry eat it because Jerry likes the belly. David then told the waiter that Jerry really likes him. But Jerry said that David would never like him if he ever found out that David and David were friends! What did Jerry say about the waiter?<n>Output: There must be a group of friends to read stories. Which group is most likely to participate?<n><n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:What emotion does getting paid lead to? Choices:  A: sorrow B: paying bills C: happiness D: frustration E: spending money<n>Output:		 A = sadness B = bills C = happiness D = frustration<n>For the emotion that leads to happiness, I would suggest feeling like you have accomplished something. So if you were paid by a company and decided to use the money you saved on whatever you want you can do now. This is really just showing that the money doesn't matter, it's the accomplishment. The emotions of sadness or frustration are feelings of dissatisfaction or rejection which are unachievable goals. So in that example, when you buy a car, it means you have something valuable instead of receiving nothing in return.<n>For the emotion that results in sorrow then feel a fear of not giving enough and then regretting wasting the money. For example, if you saved $100,000 and used it to buy a house for your family what would you regret? If you regret having spent that money I would suggest you spent it on making the family more independent. This way you're spending the money on their future and not only for your family. The money is not being wasted as you are not making it for yourself.<n><n>Click Here to Post Answer<n><n>(Please include the date the question was written) For new students, please complete the Student Account Registration Form along with the following info: student_name..._id.

The eye is so bright, that a tiny bit of light from the sun is reflected into the eye of the cat. The cat has a perfect sight, while the mirror in the room is reflecting only half the sunlight into the cat's eye and only half the sunlight is visible from the cat's point of view. Which color of cat’s eye is brighter – the one on the side of the cat or the one on the front?<n>Output: The one on the side.<n><n>Input: When the light beam is reflected through a piece of metal, only about 10% of the light is reflected back through the metal. Since most of the light is reflected through the metal, the total reflection is 10%. The percentage of reflected light increases as the light distance is longer. A light beam that’s 6 feet long and travels 10 feet away will have 10% reflected light. If the beam is six feet long and travels eight feet away, then the beam will have 40%. For each increase in the beam's distance, the reflected light increases 10%.<n>Output: The beam has 10% reflected light, hence 10% of the total beam's light will be refracted. All light that is refracted, is 90% reflected, and 90% of the total reflected light is 90% refracted.<n>Now the beam is at maximum deflection. You have now seen the beam traveling a very long distance through the air. How far away from the beam do you see the reflectors?<n>Output: The beam is at the maximum of the deflection; and the total reflected light is 40% total reflected light.<n>In

Suddenly John's father, who was sitting with him on the floor, ran up and started punching the people who were crying on the floor in their heads.  Then John realized that his father was getting a lot of pleasure from hurting others. John wondered if anyone had caught anything unusual so he asked his father about it.    John: Dad, why don't you just beat these people up so they can't get up again? Dad: Well I have tried that before and they were too tough. So I figured that I'd give you a chance to do it. John: Ok, then let's just go and get them.  Now run along, you'll be late.  Dad: But Dad these people are going to be sorry for what they have done.

Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n>Output:		 He bought it in the family room.<n>He gave the ficus a few months before he noticed that it was having some dead leaves, so he went inside and watered it by hand. Because he watered it by hand rather than using a hose, he discovered that the leaves of the ficus were turning black. The leaves had dried out and fallen off. However, he didn't notice that until he came inside for lunch and the leaf was brown. Joe decided to keep an eye on it, especially after he heard stories from friends that it was known to take up residence in the bathroom.<n>After the second leaf fell, Joe decided that he might want to see a doctor about the leaf, so he went to the closest nearby hospital to get a "look" from an employee. When Joe arrived at the building, it was very crowded, so he couldn't get in right away. Finally, when he got in, an employee told him that "we're currently out of doctors and other health professionals". So he left after he received some water and a piece of paper.<n>After the next several more leaves fell, Joe decided to take a closer look. At first, he noticed a large wound on the underside of one leaf, which was obviously from a spider bite. However, he was very concerned for it and wanted to know what it was going to look like. The leaf came out of the skin, ready to be cut open. After carefully taking out the leaf, he discovered that the wound had dried out to a smooth white. He continued to be very concerned about the leaf, which was now a large open sore that had dried out to a small, pearly white. He went to another nearby hospital that he knew would be better for his needs, and the worker who helped him with his medical needs assured Joe that he had a perfect ficus.<n><n>Input: There are seven people living in a house.

However, if you're poor, you have an 85 to 96% chance of getting divorced, but most people who get divorced are rich. A better explanation is that it's not the divorce itself that causes it, but rather the loss of the common sense, that makes people poor. So, if someone gets divorced, it's more likely to result from a marriage of convenience, but if it wasn't a marriage of convenience, it wouldn't have resulted in a divorce. Also, if the marriage of convenience had succeeded and ended on good terms, then the couple would have still ended up poor.<n><n>Input: Jane is a waitress.

Now you can estimate how much that will be over time because X has not happened yet. So ask, how long will it take for X to happen?<n>Output: The total will be x/2^(X/4) = <y.x^2/4> x = y/2^(-2Y/4) = x/y/3<n>Y is the number of months in 5 years. 4 is a natural number because of 4 + 3, and 2 is a natural number because 2/3 = 1/3. 1 is a natural number because it is the prime number. So by definition the sum of all factors of 5 will be 5, but the total will be <5/2^x/2> = x/4^(Y/4).<n>So the real answer is X is going to be <5/2>/y/4> x is going to be <2/3>/5 x/2^x/4 x/x^x^2 x divided by 2 is <5/2^(Y/4)/(2+5)/(0) = 2^(Y/4)+5^(Y/4) x/2^(5^(Y/3)) x/x^2 x/5^2 x/5/2 = <6/5^y/2> 4 x/2^(1^5^(Y/2)) x = 1/5x/6 x/2^(2^y/2)*2 = 6<n>So the final answer should be 6<n><n>Input:An airline provides two different tickets at different prices.

So he went to the store alone and bought $5 Candy. He spent $5 on candies. Then he went to the museum. The candy was just getting over. So John bought $3 worth of Candy. The total spent was $40. He had his favorite candy to buy. He bought it at the store, the store that owned the candy.  Then John went to the museum once again and bought more candy. He spent $40 + $5 = $<<$40+5=105>>105 dollars. Then he went back to the store.  The store he bought from again was the store that owned the candies. So the candy he bought was the candies that he had purchased at the store. He went back to the museum again. So he bought another $5 worth of candies. John had purchased $105 worth of candies. He went to his friend’s house. The candies were just getting over. John went to the store again. So he was buying candies from another store. So the $105 he bought from the store was not from the candy that he purchased at the museum once again. He had just purchased candies from different stores. So the amount of candies that he had is now less than the number of candies that he initially bought.<n>So the final question is 105 dollars - 105 candies = <<105 + 105=360>>360 candies<n>Thus the final answer is 360<n><n>Input:A student is studying to teach science, math, and English.

He has been training to help prepare for the battle. They had a car to transport supplies and equipment to the fort. They had to find a place to hide for when the fighting started since the fort's walls had a thick rope or chain fence over it or barbed wire as a barrier for when the enemy would enter the fort. When they were waiting, John was trained how to defend the car by shooting arrows, shooting rocks with bazooka’s and throwing knives.   After several hours the two friends met up and left the fort because they had to do some training. John was left alone in the car watching a movie. After he finished the movie, he found a gun. He used it to shoot an arrow at a rock target until it was hit and a hole in the rock. When that ended, it didn`t work again. He moved to a safe distance and moved back to the car.   It made no noise but the car looked like anything else was using the road. He thought if the enemy would enter the room they would go under the car. He put in the car and drove with everyone else towards the front of the convoy. There, he used his car to drive through the bars surrounding the fort to get to the front of the convoy and hid in the car.   Finally, John took the car around a corner and drove into his friend's bunker.   He was so happy and surprised when Tom started to shoot an arrow at something in the bunker.   John got behind something and got in the door. He sat there for a few minutes until Tom brought out two grenades and hit him.   He got hit again until he killed Tom.   He didn`t know what to do.   He was hurt and scared but there was still the car and more money left in it. He decided to stay in the car until the money runs out.   He found his car and brought it back around to the other end of the bunker to the car wash. He cleaned off everything in the car and did a thorough cleaning. He didn`t know how long it would work and if it would keep working.   He got into the car and drove the rest

The idea of the pager is that it will help them to get along better if they had different tasks each day so that they all could get their work done efficiently. Some employees like Jack and Bob work hard to try to keep up the good work while others, who are lazy, often get into trouble and end up in the office where they must wait for their boss to come to work. One morning when the boss comes back in for the day he sees a small hole in the floor in front of him. He can't explain it but at first he thinks perhaps someone slipped in. The employee who was there when he came in for the day says he must have slipped in, but Bob says the whole thing sounds made up. The boss says that he can see the hole and that is why he is so quick to judge it. The employee feels sorry for Bob because he had his shirt folded up as if to cover up the hole. After apologizing Bob tells the boss that he was only kidding him. The boss then asks Bob if he had changed the time of day on his watch. Bob admits that he did not. The boss says that it doesn't matter what time of day it is, any employee who is going to get into trouble needs to know that he needs to be there when he goes to work. The worker then tells his boss that he is going to go to the office and start working out.<n><n>Input: Alice’s mother is a doctor. Her father, William, is a well-known philanthropist.

Choices:  A: farm B: business district C: car D: amusement park E: urban area<n>Output:		 Use the same number of spaces based on the choices listed above and determine the total distance in miles and how many spaces each car had used.<n>Solution: 1. use [.02 + distance] / [0.02 + 6 / 6 =.08 + 3 / 3 =.01 +.02] = [.02 * (distance ) x 6/6 =.01]<n>2. Use the distance to determine how many spaces each car took. 3. To determine how many spaces per car each person, find the per capita percentage and increase that to the total. 4. Divide the total of per capita percentage by the total number of occupants in each car. 5. Multiply the number of occupants per car by the number of parking spaces per passenger. 6. Divide by the number of parking stalls to determine your total length (in units of feet). Your total distance in miles is (3 / 6)[300/60]= [300 ft. / 60 = 3.72191596 ft]. Your total number of feet is 30, so a total of 30 X 60=36,800 ft. Your number of spaces per car is 6, so a total of 6 X 36,800 feet. Now your total number of spaces and number of spaces per car per occupant is 16 x 36,800 / 6, or 32 for those wanting to be exact.<n>Solution: Using 0.02+18/6 =.03=0.03. 1. Find the total of per capita and per population percentage. 2. For each car, go to the parking lot and estimate how many spaces each car used based on per capita and per population percentages. 3. Divide by the number to determine the total size of each car. 4. For each occupant, use the total number of spaces per car plus the number of people and multiply by 16, or 32, then divide by the total number of passengers per vehicle. 5. Divide by the total number of cars to determine your total length. The total length of the park is 3600 and your total total number of spaces is 12, so your total length is 96.<n>Solution: Using 2, divide by 12, find the total length of the park.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:Where would you put a light?

It can then go down the middle or down one leg or up one leg on which the previous ball was already sitting. What does 5 do?<n>Output: Since it can bounce up or down, it bounces down one leg to fall, then it starts up the second leg to fall.<n>Input: When a ball hits the back of another ball, the first ball will bounce up to the back of the other ball in the same way as if it hit a wall. Why?<n>Output: Due to the momentum of the 2 balls, they do not collide and the back hits the first ball making a sound like a bump. If the 2 balls did collide, the ball at the back would be thrown back toward the center of the table.<n>Input: The ball hits the wall at the top of the table and then rolls to the bottom of the table after 8 bounces. What happens after 8 bounces?<n>Output: Since there is a drop at the bottom, there isn't any bounce.<n>Input: There is a person in the middle of the table holding an umbrella. The ball hits it to the side. If the person's umbrella moves, how does the ball bounce back to the center of the table?<n>Output: If she moves it the same way the ball bounces, then the ball moves to the other side of the table, because it bounces 8 times. If she is too far to the right for the ball to bounce up, she should have moved further up. If the ball goes to the right, it would travel up about 8 or less bounces.<n>Input: What happens to the ball if a player rolls it down the middle instead of down one leg?<n>Output: Now the ball rolls into a corner.<n>Input: The question's answer makes no sense, the same goes for #2. Could you please provide a better answer on #2?<n>Output: The answer to #2, which is the second easiest, is C.<n>Input: Since the ball is sitting directly next to the table, why has it had no

Jerusalem 2. Jerusalem 3. Jerusalem 4. Jerusalem 5. Jerusalem - C<n>Output: -C<n><n>Input: Jesus spent five days in a cave. On the fourth day, Jesus found a large bucket of fresh water to replace the one that He ate from on the previous day. After washing His feet, He placed His hands in the bucket of fresh water, making the bucket larger. As Jesus continued washing His feet, He began putting in more water until His feet grew to the height of a king and His hands no longer filled the bucket. Jesus left the bucket out and entered the Temple by an open door. On the way to the Temple, He stopped at a large stone to wash His own feet. Jesus said to the woman outside "Woman, the Son of Man must be brought to You!" When she saw Him, she left the basket on the way inside.<n>After spending the next two days washing His feet and hands, Jesus came into the Temple by an open courtyard, not the door He had entered by. Mary Magdalene came to see Him first, and Jesus asked who would have something to eat. The woman he called "Mother of the Lord," or "Mother of the Savior," was the first to eat the meal. Jesus asked Peter if he too had eaten. Peter said that Mary had eaten and he himself had not. Jesus said he would tell Mary his story. Jesus then told Peter how great God was and how wonderful He was. On the third day, Jesus was standing in the Garden of Gethsemane. John the Baptist, the prophet, had just come upon Jesus preaching the gospel to His disciples, when Jesus told John to follow Him. Jesus said to John, "Go back and tell your own disciples all about Me." So John came into the Garden to tell his disciples about Jesus Christ. When Jesus went out of the Garden to go on His walk, he told the eleven disciples "If you hear the word of God and you obey it, you will receive everything you ask for. But you must love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."<n><n>Input:The average speed of light in space is 186,792 thousand miles per hour.

Choices:  A: supermarket B: home C: closet D: mart E: hardware store<n>Output:		 At a grocery, the bags will usually have about two to four compartments. One of the compartments has food, and the other compartments have other items. One item of common food may have a plastic lid that can be placed inside the bag. If there are others of these items, your students will often use the plastic lid.<n>At home, the bags will have about five compartments. One area will have a lot of staples. There could be staples in the closet, and other staples on a shelf in an attached garage. Then there will be boxes for food, and boxes of personal products. And last, there may be boxes containing other household items. You may think to check out garage sales, or even to take advantage of a garage sale at someone else’s house, or to rent a storage space in a garage. When it comes to home, the bags will usually come with one or two compartments, but the bags for groceries may have several compartments for several food items.<n><n>Input:Who would win a race with five children, one each in the two vehicles?

He created 18 paintings. He was born July 26, 1858 in a stable in the village of Colmar, France. He died August 8, 1935. His mother died in September 1902, and his father died the following year.<n>If the painting cost 100 Euros, then the artist would have made 100 Euros if he had sold it. But given the age of many of his paintings, they're not worth much more than what a common street person would pay for. So the artist, Monet, made $2.<n><n>Input:If you are playing the piano, you will play the second verse of A minor's "Charming Boy."

You can see what I mean if you play the first beat C and then play a second beat on C. A C is the third note on C. A C B is the third note on B. A B C is the third note at the end of B.<n>So the third note on the first beat of C is C B. If you play B then the third note on B is C C. C C C B C C. So the third note of the first beat of B is C C. This

Would the car continue to travel without the spare tires?<n>The original idea was to change the tire. There are 10 spare tire positions, each of which are only 2 inches in diameter. By changing the tire, we could fix 6 of the 10 tire pressures. The original problem was to find the 4th spare tire position to fix the pressure problem. In order to fix the pressure problem, we would need to find the size of the 4th spare tire so we could remove and replace each spare tire as needed.<n>In other words, the original problem is no longer a solution. The original problem is no longer possible to solve, which means our solution is no longer possible. So the final answer is no<n><n>Input: Suppose a boy and a girl are stranded on land because some poor people live on this land.

The vehicle they purchased was $1700. The members of this car group pay $1200 for the car. One member buys a $1000 car at a garage sale for the sale price. The group members all drive around town in their cars for ten minutes. How long will it take for every one of them to fill up on gas? Why is this a problem?<n>Output: The total number of gallons left is 1000. The group of 6 does not drive over 40 minutes. In fact, they average around 2.5 gallons per person per trip. Since they were driving for ten minutes, 20 gallons left = 1000 x 2000 = 20000. Thus an average of 2000 gallons per individual will fill up a full tank in ten minutes. The individual who bought the $10 car will have 20000 gallons left in his car. The total amount will be $2000 dollars. That will take about 12 hours of fuel to fill up the car. This is a problem.<n><n>Input:Two parents had a fight and the mother left their house. She said to the father that she will pay back the money she borrowed from him for the fight. The father paid her $1200 back and asked the mother to stop making the payments. What is the amount of money the mother owes the father?<n>Output: The payment was $1200. Since the payment was made two years ago, the payment was backdated.<n>The amount owed is $1200. If that had been a month ago, the payment would have only been $800 which is four days' worth of her wages. Therefore, it would not be a huge problem. Just a couple days' pay. However, this is in addition to the debt with the car. Since they have five children, that's four days of school, five days of sports, and about $200 worth of toys etc. They owe about $2500 dollars. The amount that she owes is over $2,500. They owe her about 50 payments of $800 dollars and they are currently paying her another $1200 a month on an installment plan. So the total amount that she owes is $3,600.<n>They owe her about 50 payments total. She owes them $1500. They will be out $1600 bucks a month for thirty payments.<n>The total amount that she owes her parents is $3,600<n><n>Input:If you could buy your choice of four items and bring them back to

The amount that you had to spend to buy the door was $1200 / 3 x $1200 = $1800, and then $1800 was divided amongst the participants. If everyone had the same dollar amount, what would happen, and how much total money was made?<n>Output:The $1200 spent by the three doorers is $<<1800-600=6000>>600<n>Everyone would be $<6000. So the total amount divided by all would be $5600.<n>Now take $5600 and divide by the total number of participants, since one doorer would have gotten 60.<n>Total divided by 6 people = $56. So the total amount lost is $56.<n>So the final total is $5600

Some people simply don't understand that it is not enough to have a horse's face in the background, but rather the horse has to be the foreground. Even if the horse is included in the background, it would be considered a background horse. Therefore you have to work on a story where the horse is the foreground and that there are other horses in the background for each horse. Some artists think that all they have to do is have only one horse in the background and use the other horses as the background. However, this is an art work that just shows the horse's face. It still makes the people in the background part of the background, and therefore you have to actually use several horses as background horses for the background horse.

Also it means the Arabic that the Arabian people speak, which means the Arabic dialect.<n>Start learning Arabic vocabulary by reading a book called The Arabic Language by Dr. Amine Shaddadi. In this book there are a lot of vocabulary words that are very popular, and if you are learning Arabic then you should just memorize those words. Try and learn one word a day to make it easier for you. After you memorize the words one by one then you can try to pronounce them because you have already learned the pronunciation.<n>Another book called Learn Arabic by Dr. Amine Shirshid is also recommended, but for people who don’t have the time to learn a new language it will be useless for you. Instead, a website named iyasafir.com has already translated most of the vocabulary from different sources into Arabic. At the website there is also a dictionary that is used on iyasafir so it is very safe and easy to use. I would suggest you to try and learn the website.<n>Another website where you can learn all the Arabic vocabulary is www.syriagames.com (syriagames.co.uk).

We start with 10 packages of cheese, and then each person takes 20 packages of cheese and makes a single trip to the cheese store. After he finishes, how much more cheese does each participant have?<n>We have 10 packages of cheese, so we will make 20 trips to the cheese store, thus 10 times 10 = 40 trips to the cheese store. Then we get 10 /20 = 40 /20 = 80 / 20 = 40 / 80 = 40 packages of cheese. If only one person buys all 80 packages, how much cheese does he have?<n>The total of 40 / 80 = 240 = 240 cheese<n>So the total of 240 / 40 = 240 cheese<n>So he has to divide 240 into 10 for the correct answer: 40 / 80 = 240 cheese<n><n>Input: If a farmer and a plumber were to meet at a river, and they needed some paper towels, what should be the first thing they would do?<n>Output: First thing that the farmer and the plumber would do is to ask for paper towels from each other.<n>If they came into contact with each other, they would feel like they should pay each other some paper towels or something.<n>They might offer to trade paper towels with each other because now that they have had a little experience with paper towels they would probably be pretty generous.<n>Now that we have met, they would have some paper towels in their possession. We can't have such nice paper towels if we are working together! If we meet at the river we have to talk about how to best use them. Perhaps we can find a place with some trash and use paper towels to clean it up. After spending an hour at the river it is best to walk back to the town and buy some paper towels to use there.<n>Output: First thing farmers do is to ask for some paper towels from the plumber.<n>Second thing plumber do is to ask for toilet paper from the farmer.<n>Third step is to share some other kinds of paper towels such as tissues, and then finally they decide on where to make the exchange of the paper towels.<n><n>Input: You were given $4000 and are given a year to find a business that will use the money, and make a profit.

The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:When I was home, I was comfortable.  But I had a crippling fear of going where?

The grand prize includes a trip to Hawaii.      The school decided it doesn't matter which child wins, but rather the child who gets most votes votes should win.    Children were to write a letter to the parent of their choice saying what they liked or didn't like about the teacher.    Each child with a winning letter would be sent one ticket to the contest.    So every letter had to include a number, but all different letters would have a different number.    Students filled out the school forms to submit their letters with their school tickets.    The only difference is that only one letter was needed.    In the morning of voting day, each child had five school tickets to hand out to their friends.    The school officials tallied the ballots, and the children with the winning letters were awarded the tickets to go to Hawaii.   So each child with one winning letter got to go to Hawaii, and the child with the most votes would get the prize and receive an honorable mention from the officials.  So at the end of the day every child with a winning letter got to go.   So the students who got all five winning tickets would go.    So the parent voted for their children and gave them the winning tickets for all their friends.   So the parents with five winning tickets won one of the prizes.    So to win the trip students needed a majority of students voting for them.   The parents had an overwhelming majority.<n>Now here is the part where the student would receive one of the five tickets.   There is an anonymous mail service that will send one ticket for a $20 gift card.<n>So each student received one ticket for $20.   If the two of the tickets to Hawaii were sold the winner would receive $40.   In order for this plan to work the parents would need two parents to vote for their children.   The parents were happy because their children had won.  So they could share the tickets with family and friends.  So five extra tickets went into the trash.

The old man said, "It's simple, I'll give you a nickel for every time you say you'll do something." The doctor said, "You're right". The old man said, with a smile, "Here's a nickel, give it a try". The doctor said, "Okay". After a while of trying, the old man went home to fetch his wallet, and he went out. Next morning, with the nickel still on his finger, he came back. The old man said to the doctor, "Give me 10 more minutes." The doctor said "Yes" and went out. The old man went out and came back with his wallet. The doctor said, with a smile "I gave you 20 minutes" and went out. When the old man came back, the doctor said, with a laugh, "Here is my car keys." The old man said, knowing the truth, "Thanks! I'll just try to give you 10 more minutes." The doc said, "You got it!" The old man said, again, with a big smile and walked out. The doctor left. The old man was thinking of what he would say to the old man now that he was out of money. He couldn't imagine how the old man could give him back the nickel in 10 minutes. Then he started thinking of what other things he could say to the doctor to earn him the nickel back to buy his medicine. Then he said, "Maybe you should fix my car."

He decided to spend $50,000 advertising a project he has created. The company has been successful, but he wants to increase his salary, so he will give the corporation a loan from a credit union for $100,000.<n>Output: If the CEO's salary is $100,000, then his salary = $> $50,000. The total salary of the corporation is $150,000<n>Since $> $50, 000, then the salary of the company is equal to $150,000.<n>Since $150,000 is equal to $50,000, then the salary of each salary at the corporation is equal to $150k<n>Since $50,000 + $150,000 = $150,000, then the salaries are equal to $150k.<n>Since $150k = $50,000, the salary of the founder is equal to $200,000, so his total salary is $250,000<n>Since $250,000 = < $50,000, his salary is equal to $50k. He is unemployed and has $50,000 to invest<n>Since $50k + $50+$100k = $250k, his salary is equal of $500k. He owns the corporation and has a new salary<n>Thus his salary of $500k = $10k<n>Since $10k = $50k, he is unemployed and has $25,000 to invest. Therefore, his savings has increased<n>Since $25k + $50k = $50k<n>Thus his savings is now $50,000.<n>Since the salaries are equal to each other, the total is $150k<n>So the final answer with the above answers is $200,000<n><n>Input: P.

She is the second woman to ever go to space and she will become the first American woman to ever go into space. Every time an astronaut reaches a new orbit, she has to push her space vehicle forward to reduce friction.<n>The ship is on earth and she is near the center of gravity. As the astronaut lowers her arm off her spacecraft the ship speeds up, which makes it harder to push the ship forward. When the astronaut lowers her arm near the center of gravity she can move her arm up and down on the ship. At 50 kms from the Earth, the shuttle vehicle speeds up again and when the astronaut lowers her arm the shuttle speeds up to 70 kms. She pushes her spacecraft forward, which decelerates the shuttle and increases the thrust. As the shuttle slows down its arm moves to her shoulder and her arm reaches down to touch the ship again. She pushes the shuttle forward, which reduces the forward momentum of the shuttle and increases the spacecraft's forward momentum. At 70 kms the shuttle reaches 60 kms, then 67 kms and is above 80 kms when she lowers her arm. The shuttle then slows down in altitude slightly to 0.3 kms, but the arm reaches out even faster than when she pushed the spacecraft forward and pushes the shuttle faster to 90 kms. As she stops lowering the space vehicle and the thrusters stop running, she is in orbit with her arm resting on the shuttle. What is the final force she has to apply for the shuttle to reach its full height?<n>Output: The final force applied in reaching her full height can be calculated as:<n>F = F-F-F + F-F-F = N + F + F-F = N+F-F = FN+F-F = N+N-F= FFN+F-F= FN+1<n>So the final answer of:<n>F = F + F-F- F-F = N + N + F- F- F-F = FN + F-F- 1<n>is correct.<n><n>Input and Answer:In the game, a group of five people plan to visit the tallest mountain in the world.

One person takes extra strokes for putting, the next takes extra strokes for putting after hitting, they both take extra strokes for putting after walking, etc. If they get even scores, their scores should be equal. If they get one-over, their scores should be added and their scores should be averaged. If both golfers get an even score on the same hole, the person who took the extra stroke will be the person to get a bonus stroke on the next hole.<n>Each golfer takes an extra stroke on the hole if they had to putt (putting after hitting, putting after walking), or if they took extra strokes because of walking on a green. Each golfer should get a bonus stroke on every hole.<n>Both golfers should take extra strokes if they hit into the pond, hit into a water hazard, hit beyond the par 3 boundary, hit into a hazard that is over 4 feet deep in the fairway, hit into a par 3 where there is no green, hit into a hazard with water on the bank, or into a hazard that is more than 4 feet deep in the hole.<n>If someone has to take more strokes, the score should be averaged.<n>If someone has a handicap of 35, they should play against handicaps of 35+. If someone has a handicap that is too high, the scores should not be averaged<n>Each golfer's average score should add up to 35.<n>Each golfer's handicap should count the same as his or her player score because one handicap score will be a negative score, and the total score added will count negative as well, and add back the average score from each player.<n>If both golfers take extra strokes in this way, then the bonus stroke will count just as the other players, but it should be subtracted from the total score so that only the golfer with negative scores will be penalized for extra strokes on the same hole because his or her handicap will be lower than the golfer who was penalized.<n>The rules are as follows:<n>A player who has to take extra strokes in this manner loses

Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n>Output:		 Nothing else was expected except good grades.<n><n>Input:If a person is willing to pay $5.00 for a new book, is it fair to expect them to pay more for used books? The answer depends on the condition of the book. One book used for $1.00 might not have many dust jackets or pages, but would not be as clean. Another used book might have the dust jackets, but most pages are tattered as well. The remaining pages could be worn, faded, or torn, or both. The person buying the book may also choose to buy a used book as well, while the person giving the book away may choose to sell it to someone who will use it or donate it to another school. If the book does not have much pages or dust jacket and is good as new, then it is fair to expect the person selling to pay more. If the book is used for a low price and looks ok, then it would be ok to offer the book for sale at $2.00 each. The person giving the book away might choose to give the book for free to someone else, but if they do this people are usually willing to pay a premium price for the free book, giving them an additional $2.00. The person selling might also choose to give the book away for free, but people are also sometimes willing to pay a premium for a used book. If the book is worth less than the amount of donation charges, the person who wanted to be fair in pricing their book may choose to buy the book for what they were willing to pay for the book in the first place. If the book is more expensive than the cost of the book, then it is fair for everyone to ask the person who wants to buy the book to pay more. Any price higher than the cost of the initial book costs is a bit of a discount.<n><n>Input:What’s the difference in hours between John, Jane, Mary and Bob?

He pulled over a gas station and decided to go inside. He quickly pulled the engine over and waited to see a doctor. After about 30 minutes, they decided that he needed to go to the emergency room. Before he left, his doctor asked him if he felt anything. He felt a strange pain in his stomach, but he denied it out of fear of the cost. Finally after an hour he was able to leave without a fee. As he was driving through the hospital, he saw a number of patients and one in particular was having his appendix removed. So he pulled the car over and the doctor rushed to the bathroom. When he came out of the bathroom, he saw the patient with his appendix removed walking through the hospital so he followed him and helped him walk down the hall. The patient got on a wheelchair and he drove him to the exam room. As he was walking in the checkin area, he looked over and saw that all the chairs were filled with patients. As he was walking toward an exam room, one of the women who was on a back brace was on the floor writhing in pain. The doctor told him to call a nurse and she would get the bed for him. He immediately ran over and got her a wheelchair and he wheeled her in and wheeled her back into the room. The doctor came out of the examination room and saw that the patient was in severe pain. He asked the nurse for help and she immediately got his back brace off and called a doctor. The doctor came out and was shocked when he looked at the patient. The patient told him that as he walked over to get her back brace on, the pain in her arms and stomach increased. When she was in excruciating pain, he drove through the hospital and drove all the way to the ER and the ER doctor was the one who finally got her an epidural. Since his car is a lot bigger than other cars, he had to drive around all the parked cars to find a place for his patient to be admitted.<n><n>Input: A man was driving on a desert highway when he saw a lone cow.

Choices:  A: teach B: cost money C: do work D: be productive E: help people<n>Output:		 Do work<n>Employees spend their time working on different projects. It only takes 2 hours for employee A to solve a problem for example. The 2 hours ends and nobody is more productive than before working in the office. Employee A spends 30 minutes to complete one of the problems in each of the 6 cubicles.<n>Output: 0<n>Employees are paid for their work. When employee A completes his work, he gets paid $100. When employee B does the same, he gets paid $35. EmployeeC spends 1 minute reading the company handbook and completing the problem. The handbook ends a little later, and employee C spends a little more time, but he only gets paid $14 for this. Thus the total productivity is 50.<n>Employees are expected to earn money from their jobs to put into their 401ks. Employee C spends $10 of his $11 salary every week. Employee B spends $50 of his $60 per week. Employee D pays $10 of his $60 per month, and Employee B spends $90 of his $100 per month on the same. They earn $100 per person each month. So each employee has $80 to put into their 401k. After 6 years, they should have $160 of retirement money, with no need to apply for any retirement funds. So far, employee C will have $160 of savings, employee A will have $100, employee B will have $35, employee D will have $30, and the last two employees will have $15 each.<n>Output: 0

The deficit may worsen if the government’s debt is $300,000,500. The government needs to lower its debts before this happens. For example, the government could sell its assets at a substantial discount to its worth, and raise taxes on those who currently hold assets like stocks or bonds and invest the proceeds in government bonds. How much more is the government going to need, and how long will it take to get the deficit under control?<n>Output: $300,000,00 is 1/3rd of the deficit so they get $100,000,000, for a total of $200,000,000<n>The deficit won't go down until government bonds go down, which is also estimated over several years<n>It will be a very slow process, so the deficit does not need to be reduced so fast, perhaps 3-5 years<n>The government will require about $200,000,5,000 to reduce its deficit<n>About half of this will come from selling assets of stock and bonds at a discount<n><n>Input: A company wants to raise $200,000,00 in capital. They plan to sell 4,000 shares of 1 million shares each at prices ranging from $1000 to $15000. Each dollar should be worth $200. Who will be buying these shares, and how much will they be paying to purchase them? There are 1.4 million shares of 100 shares at $3000. They are $1500 apiece. So at the $3000 price, the buyer might pay $3000. The stock may take up to 6 months to sell, so the buyer will buy the stock at the low price of $1000.<n>Output: The buyers will buy 4,000,000 shares at $10000 = $<<30000/4000=1000>>1000 = 500.<n>So the buyers will pay $100,000,5,500 for 200,000 shares of stock, or $<<100,000,5.5>5,500 = 500<n>Which one of the following statements is true?<n>a) Share prices are expected to fall and not increase<n>b) Shares will rise with the price.<n>c) The company will not know prices until they are bought<n>d) The government will not buy stock in the company<n><n>Input: A baby boy was born on June 22

Your father would need to wash and pair each shirt, and then wash each shirt twice more. Since the shirt would cost $100, your father would either need to buy an extra shirt every week, or use a different shirt. In the average adult's clothing budget, only one extra washing and matching of clothes happens every two weeks, for a total of five washing, matching and drying. Therefore, his new shirt is approximately $20 per wear, $100 times five (or 20 / 12 = 12 dollars) equals $4,240. He can spend $1000/year on clothes, and in the last ten years he could have bought $1,240 worth of clothes. Using a conservative 20 / 12 rule, that would work out to $1/year per year in excess clothes money. So if you're your father, you can spend $1100/year on clothes. You could give your dad the shirt that is missing so he has eight shirts for $400 = $400/10 = $600.<n>Output: If you can wash and matching your dad's 8 extra shirts, he would make $600. So $600 for eight shirts = $200 for 8 shirts = $600 = $600.<n><n>Input:A group of five friends plans to get new shoes, and everyone wants to get a different pair of shoes.

How did John pay for the socks without spending any money?<n>Output: So for an amount of $35, John has all 5 pairs of socks and wants to return them. He asks, "Do you want three socks or two socks?" Since John knows that for an amount of $10, he only really needs two pairs, he will either ask, "Do you want two red, two white and a striped?" Since he already has both red and white socks on hand, he will ask the clerk, "Do you have striped socks?" Once he gets 2 pairs of blue and 3 pairs of red, John pays for the other two pairs. After he pays for the three pairs, he goes down to the cashier and asks for "Five pairs white and red?" Once he gets the 5 pairs, he walks out of the store and comes back with all of the socks. Thus he paid for all 5 pairs without any sales. Since he already had all 5 pairs, there was no net spend. Thus he didn't spend any money.

How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:If people listen, they can understand each other better.  If they understand each other, they can do what? Choices:  A: pay bills B: swap bodies C: learn from each other D: believe in god E: talk to each other<n>Output:		 If people listen to each other, they can understand each others wants and needs. If the people they are listening to are not interested in what they are saying, they will never understand the desires of the other person. They will never learn to share, which means they will never trust each other.  They can also have arguments, which makes them not trust each other.<n>Output: If people understand each other, they will become friends and will never have arguments. All relationships are built on trust and understanding.<n>Output: People listening to each other can solve the world’s ills.<n>Output: You can listen to whoever you want to listen to.<n>Output: This is only a small part of the entire solution!

The third child in the group, who hasn’t yet decided on a direction, says quietly, “I don’t know what I want to be.”   The other kids are curious, so she says slowly and softly, “Maybe your parents don’t know either, so it doesn’t matter what age they are.”   Her father replies, “Of course he doesn’t know what he wants to be. Who wants an old man?” The other kids laugh, but one of them tries to be sympathetic, but says sadly, “He seems to be happy being where he is now.”<n>Output: She is right. People don’t have to know what they want to be. In fact, sometimes it is better not to know. Sometimes there are people who know what they want to do, and they are successful but don’t know why. It doesn’t mean that they are failures, but it does mean that something went wrong somewhere that they didn’t know about.<n>Output: Just because someone is unhappy with the choices they’ve made, it doesn’t mean they can’t achieve everything they set out to do. There are things that will make people unhappy, but that doesn’t mean the road to happiness is impossible. They can see the positive sides of decisions they have made, and they can learn to be happy along the way.<n>Output: Children are not limited to their physical bodies—they can do anything.<n>Output: People can only do what they do

Therefore, the first option requires knowledge of each species while the second one requires knowledge only of Geography. Therefore, the second option, that of the first one will not work. For the third choice, the sharks cannot be found even in clear tunnel. It is said that sharks are rarely seen above the ocean's surface while the third option states that the sharks are never seen above the ocean's sea surface. Therefore, the second one is not possible. In the fourth choice, sharks can be sighted almost anywhere as stated in the second one. Therefore, the fourth option is possible. Let's assume that there are four sharks in a clear tunnel. It is now stated to me that this tunnel is the Atlantic ocean. As I am about to move through the tunnel to the west, the tunnel ends and the sharks disappear. The problem is I can't see them anywhere. In the fifth and last task, the sharks can be sighted just about anywhere in the sea. Therefore, the final option is the sixth one. Let's assume that four sharks are visible near the water's surface. And the sixth option is only possible in this case. That is the sixth option where the sharks are never seen in the water but in caves hidden there. The final solution is sixth option.<n>It is written that sharks are seen near the surface of waves. The six option is found here. In the eighth task, sharks are not rare wherever in the sea they are. That is the eighth option. Finally, the ninth task is the tenth one. Sharks are not seen everywhere. That is the ninth option.

B A D E<n>Solution:  A B D E<n>The first problem is about pressuring. James feels the pressure and is unable to make his way without pressure. James is losing, but refuses to quit and refuses to die.   The second problem shows that you can quit by trying harder to try winning.  James can't seem to win so he tries harder to win and dies.<n>The last problem shows that pressure causes dying. James dies, but at least he tried his best to try and win.<n>To sum it up: James wanted to quit, so that's why he wanted to stop competing. He felt the pressure and made himself win.

What was his reaction?<n>Output:The group of friends agreed to be the photographer for the day and gave James the money to cover the trip. James had no money to pay for his girlfriend.   The only thing that James could do was to tell his girlfriend that he was going to leave with one of his friends.  She agreed and came with the group. James still had money for her, but he had no idea where he was going to get another $50.  If he could not come up with any money by the time they left, his girlfriend would have to find work and the group would lose the money they agreed to pay him.<n>The group of friends was afraid of losing the money because it was from a school project. James wanted to go to the beach and take pictures, so he would still have a camera to take the pictures with along with him.  He did not feel pressure because he didn't have to pay for anything because of the school project.  He just felt that his friends felt bad about losing money because they knew that he was going to have to pay for something.<n>The group left the school and went down to the pier. Once they were able to find someone who would take pictures for them, James was asked to take pictures of them with the camera. James felt pressured because it was the first time he was going to have someone other than his friends take pictures of him.  He knew that someone would not be able to take good quality pictures. James felt anxious that the pictures would not be good.  Since no one paid for his girlfriend, he was forced to take pictures of his girlfriend and his friends.<n>

If he accepts the raise, how much should he work? Calculate the average raise and divide by the hours to get that many hours.<n>Output: Total time for a new employee to get a one-month raise is approximately:  3 x (8 hours – 8) = 2.5 x 2.5 = 4  hours (3.6 x 80 x 30 = 90 hours)<n>The employee worked an average of 60 hours per week in order to get a 5% raise. So the employee earned 5.6 hours per week for her time. If a new employee works an average of 60 hours, the average increase is 45%, or about $25 per hour, to $75.25 per hour.<n>Output: Average wage for new employee at 5% raise is $7500, or $65 an hour. Divide 75 x $ 65 x $325 = $7500. So the employee earned 85 hours at the new wage, or $65 an HOUR.<n>So the new pay for the new employee is about $7500 per year.<n>So the average net pay for the new employee at the new wage is about $3750 per year.<n><n>Input:There are five employees hired for 30 days at $1,000 each. If employees work 40 hours per week, then how much money would be spent to get them all trained? Calculate the cost.<n>Output: The employees work 40 hours a week and earn $1000 per week. Therefore each employee would receive 1/3 the normal training allowance. The total cost of the training would be $2000, or half the normal allowance.<n>Output: Total training cost for 30 hours of training is $2000, or $150 an hour.<n>If the time required for training is 3.3 days, then training would cost $1800. Therefore training costs $750 per employee.<n>So training costs per employee are $1200 (50 x $1000 = $1200)<n>So training costs $750 per employer.<n>So the net cost is $1000 per employer.<n>So this is how expensive it is

The six friends divided the cost equally, $200 / 2 = $<<200/2=400>>400.<n>So the final four people will share the savings of the car.<n>So after the six friends decided that each person should have a share of this savings, they should divide the costs equally and $200 / 2 = 200/2 = 40/2. So they should each pay $40 / 2 = $40/2 = $200. So the final answer is $200<n><n>Input:A group of six friends decided that they should each pay $1500 for a car. The group has been searching for a car for four years, they have a total of $15k. Each friend in the group is saving $1000 for two years, they each receive $1500. For example, when the final friend decides to buy a car, they divide the cost equally $1500/2 = $<<1500/2=1200>>1200. So the final four people will now have $600 saved. So the six friends are now saved $800 and $1200 so a net saving of $1200. Thus they are now equal, saving $1200, therefore they should split the saving equal between themselves. So the final four must pay $1200 / 2 = $100/2 = $200/ 2. So the final four have to pay $200 / 2 = >>200/ 2 = $400 so the final four have to share their savings at $200 / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100. So the final four should each pay $40/2 = >>40/ 2 = $160 so the final four have share $160/2 = $<<160/2=75>>75. So the final four now jointly share in the savings, thus the final four now have $200/2 = <<200/2 = 75>>75 sharing their savings equally for the net savings of $150, thus they should be equal, saving an equal share in the savings, $150<n>So the final answer to this is 125<n><n>Input:Two people are at a store when a customer comes in and starts to buy groceries.

And then we sum CostOfFood to CostOfWater.<n>If we had $1000 in our house then we'd subtract Cost ofWater - CostOfFood to find that CostOfFood would be $300. Since we have only $99 in our house, we'll use the $99 cost.<n>Now we take the other two costs. CostOfFood = CostOfWater + CostOfFood. Now we subtract $300 - $99 from CostOfFood.<n>If we subtract $300 from CostOfWater, we take the other $300 from CostOfFood. Then we add the remaining $900 to the other two costs to calculate the $1200 CostOfFood and $1200 CostOfWater. Finally we round up to the nearest dollar and divide the remaining $900.<n>Now, we simply find the total of $1200 in our house, and divide it by $1200/6 = $1200/36 hours. That gives us the number of people that our food will feed. And then we take the number of people that Water will feed, and figure OutWhatIf which is the number of people that we think we'd lose if our power and our water went out, and divide by the number of hours that our food will feed them.

You're not going to learn much in school at your level. 3. School has to do with teaching so it is supposed to increase your ability to learn. 4. If your parents can't afford to pay for yourself you need help, but that can be provided at home by your teachers, but school is not that kind of help. Determination is needed to help students become good at school. 5. School has to help you become a better worker. If you have to put up with other kids in your class, that is a part of schooling. If you find a good teacher that can help you study, homework and prepare for tests, your schooling will get considerably easier. 6. It doesn't pay to be lazy. Your parents will have to help pay for you to be well educated. Determination should be rewarded. You have to do your best work and keep working hard in school for all of your efforts.

A group of nine girls will be doing a presentation and they have been invited to stay at an apartment. The girls will be doing homework and they have a small refrigerator. The refrigerator will be at the fridge’s top. What is the best way for a group of nine girls to store their food?<n>Output:If food was stored like this they would store it with their clothes in their closet.<n>The girls could also store their food in the refrigerator in their food compartment in a bag with dividers inside, but a more effective way would be to stack the food up to create multiple compartments in another compartment. The compartment with the groceries would be the food compartment. The dividers are a smart way to keep the food organized and easily accessible.<n>This is not a practical solution for one girl because she has a single refrigerator (the female fridge), since a person could easily mistake this fridge for her kitchen so it would waste food. Using storage in a storage container is also impractical because the food would have to be kept organized somehow and there are a variety of storage containers used for this purpose.<n><n>Input:You find ten other people who are willing to join a team for a baseball game.

The only person who said no was his best friend. He said that his best friend never wanted them and that they were hers. He said that her friends were always jealous of her and that wasn't fair. When my daughter asked why they never get the glasses, he said that he didn't know and that he doesn't want them anyhow because their sister had them.<n>2nd answer = She asked everyone! I think that is a good question because they both got glasses. Each of them got the glasses for their different needs. One needed to walk with glasses, one needed to see with contacts, and my daughter needed just for her to see.<n>3rd answer = She didn't get the glasses because her friend never asked her. The boy was always talking to his friend.<n>4th answer = He never asked! My daughter said that she wanted the glasses for a friend because sometimes she has trouble seeing.

Choose this answer if you know the origin: "Nausea is a symptom of a serious medical condition — vomiting — usually accompanied by abdominal pain and nausea. It occurs when the digestive system is not receiving enough nutrients for proper digestion and functioning. [1]. The word "nausea," derived from the Latin noun nausea, originally meant "a feeling of sick or sickening." It entered common parlance in mid-18th century France in the context of food as an ill-effects of eating; its first documented use was in the 1750s in a translation of Cicero's Politics.[1] It is unclear when the expression "nausea," coined when the word "nause" was used as a noun, became used to refer to a specific cause, but it is fairly widespread today. "It has been argued that the first recorded use of the term "nausea" in literature was in the English poet John Keats' first-century poem, The Odyssey, where it means "fear, trembling or ill." [1]<n>Output: "Nausea" was a part of the common lexicological lexicon by the late 18th century. In the 1860s, "nausea," as a noun, refers to "a severe vomiting and diarrhea episode." [4][3] In the 1930s, it was commonly used as a noun describing diarrhea. [5] Usage began to decline in the 1950s and 1960s; by the 1970s, the term had disappeared from use.[6]<n><n>Input: A person was born blind and his mother said he would never read books, as he was not a "bookworm" (from a French bookworm "to understand how books are written") but he loved to be around books. To overcome his blindness, his grandmother asked her mother to help. The mother made him a special chair in front of a small black & white TV. Every morning, the grandmother told this story to her son, who kept asking his mother:<n>"Why didn't your grandmother help me when I was a baby? How could I be born blind and not be educated around books? I will never read."<n>But when the grandmother thought it over, she remembered that she had not read himself a book since she was a child.

Choices:  A: empathy B: anxiety C: knowlege D: falling down E: hear things<n>Output:		 Comparing two pictures they think of a black and a white person, they would describe the person as "dark".<n>Suppose the black and white person is black and the person is white. They would say the person is black and, if they are white, they would say they are white as well.<n>So the final question is "Can you describe what you see from the two pictures?".<n><n>Input:Two of them were the top students and one was the bottom. The teacher asked all the students to think about why one of them wasn’t on the math team. The question was “Would you give a $5 bet to the person who was the worst and said they were the best?” Each student could think of a reason why. The teacher offered a $5 bet because he thought students were much better athletes if they were better athletes than they were sportspeople. So, the teacher offered the $5 bet to John who was the worst and would give him the $5. John quickly agreed, but the rest of the class voted against him. What was supposed to happen?<n>Output: John agreed to give $5 to the teacher because he thought it was unfair and unfair is bad.<n>John was a terrible athlete. His team lost every game, not one team won. He thought if he was more athletic, then people would be better at giving him a $5 bet. So he thought it was important that people wanted to give him a $5 bet because if someone did, then they would probably want to give him a $10 bet or maybe even a $20 bet also. And if John had a good reputation the money would be more likely to come his way in bets. So, the $5 bet was a mistake. He was a poor student because he never worked hard to help others. He thought that if people were nicer to him, then he would help them. He thought that if he gave other people money, then they would help him, too.<n><n>If the teacher had said that he offered $5 to the person who was bad, and the class had said that they offered $5 to the people who said that they were not the bottom, would it be correct to put John's reply in the right column and John's reply in the left column?<n>Output:<n>That was a bad idea because students think money comes from things that are good and money can come from bad things. They think that money can come from all kinds of things, even from bad

A: In the long jump the goal is to land three different times (four if you are a sprinter), so the time it takes for an athlete to jump is usually around one minute. The distance in the short jump is usually around five yards. A long jump is a race. There is a goal of landing four different times in the race. If you do not land, no longer than 3 times, your time is wasted. If you land less than 3 times in the race, that means you need to improve your technique, work out more, etc.<n>Output: In the long jump, the goal is to land four times (four if you will be a sprinter). So the time it takes for the athlete to jump is usually one minute. The distance is usually three yards. The difference between the time it takes to jump in both the long and short jump is roughly 30 seconds, so the difference in distance between the 2 events is roughly one yard.<n><n>Input:In the short jump, the athletes have to jump at least three times in order for their score to count. Therefore, the time it takes to perform each jump is 2 minutes. In the long jump, however, the goal is to perform four or more jumps. This is why the distance in the long jump is about 50 yards. Therefore, the overall time to complete an event is about 4 minutes.<n>Output: When in the

The bottle my friend Bob was left with was empty (I told him Bob could drink all my whiskey). I was later robbed by Bobby, which meant I had to share half my whiskey with him. That left me with a full bottle of whiskey, which I gave to my friend Bob, who was robbed by Chuck.

There first choice is a group of four letters, they then write one word with the four letters as their words. Answers to the first three questions can be obtained by counting the number of letters in a word: B1, B2, B3 and B4 and a group of four letter words can be written with 4 letters. B1 will not be the same as A1. There is no way that B1 can be A1. So there are only 2 ways that B2 can be A2 and these are: A1 + B2 = B3 + A1 or A2 + B3. There are 4 ways that B4 can be A2. The letters B, B1, B2 and B3 are the only 5 letters that will make a B3. The 6th letter is O and it will make the word B4. So B4 is not in the same order as A2 and A1. The letters A, A1, A2 and A3 can be taken with two of the top 3 letters. There is only three letter combinations that can put an 8 into the order. This is not possible with the four letter combinations: A2 + B1 + B2 = A4. There are 5 combinations possible with two letters that will make an 8: a2 + A3 + A6 + A7<n>Input:The four children take turns choosing a word.

He plans to practice on his own, but will need a case.<n>Because there are two cases: cases E and F, John needs to get two cases to play with.  Since only one violin case is sufficient, John needs two cases. So John will need more stringers than the four stringers from A, B, C and D. So the total of the four stringers plus the extra player = the four stringers plus two stringers + one stringer + the third stringer. So the total of four plus two is $400<n>So John needs three stringers, plus another stringer, plus another string player, plus two stringer, plus another violin player and extra stringer = $400.<n>The money is just not there, so the rest can be saved to buy more equipment and practice in school.<n>So, John has made violin and has learned playing the violin. He makes another violin because he would like to learn more about the violin and to practice more often.<n>So the final solution is violin + stringers = violin + stringers + $200.00 + violin<n>Output = $<n>So the final answer = $<n><n>Input: Jane believes that her cat is not getting enough attention.

The answer is: The most I'd like for her is to come back alive. The next item is a picture of how the teacher described the person that she was asked to describe. The teacher's description was: She is so thin, I can't even see her ribs. There were two different sentences that were used the teacher asked for the students' opinions, the first sentence was the same as the teacher's but it read: She was so thin I couldn't even see her ribs and the second sentence was: I only know she was so thin because of the way I looked at her.<n>Next question was to find the two sentence that would be the same as the two sentences and this student was told not to use any extra words and that the first sentence would be exactly the same as the teacher said. Next question was to find out what the two sentences really were and the student was told not to answer anything but to just say all they could. Next, the question was to find the answer that was the same as the second sentence after the two sentences. So the answer to last week's question and the next week question are the same as the second and third sentences but not after the next two sentences.<n>Next week, the student is asked another question by the teacher. This time, the teacher is going to ask not if the person that the student wrote about was the same as the person the student showed earlier, but what the person that the student showed earlier did was in the first paragraph of the poem that she wrote. The student was allowed to answer any additional questions she had, if she had any, or simply the teacher told the student that they should answer the question that the students were given as part of the assignment.<n>So the questions for next week

Choices:  A: health center B: vagina C: emergency room D: drawer E: medicine cabinet<n>Output:		 D: D: D<n>You could ask: Why would you not have contraceptives if you are a woman? The answer is not the same if you are not a woman, because contraceptives can be used for women also.<n>The cost of contraceptives for men is relatively expensive. Men and women are different as well because of their different sizes and shapes. The cost is based on the volume of an orgasmic period. An orgasmic period is the time where a man or woman feels the most intense sexual pleasure. Men usually have between 7 and 34.5 minutes, while women usually have between 11 and 41.<n>You can get a male birth control pill for about $20 at pharmacies. Your doctor will also prescribe the pills for men if your doctor or midwife is a woman. The price varies from drug to drug and brand to brand.<n>If you are a non-woman, you can buy a sterilization or a vasectomy for around the same price. You can also get a tubal ligation for around $150 and an IUD for only $10. However, most of these options are only available to women or to young girls.<n>Men should take a look at the price of contraceptives and take some action to reduce the price. If you can't get affordable contraceptives, it is best not to get an orgasm in the future or use other methods.<n><n>Input:Where did the money to build up the construction industry come from? Choices: Government of course!<n>Output: Government of course! Yes the money to build up our country came from a government.<n>If it comes from the government of course it is a government. That is the reason why we have a government.<n>But government has to raise the funds. The government needs to borrow the money from some countries so that we can build. It does this by giving us more borrowing rights in the countries from which they borrow to build.<n>There are many countries that have the same interest in building a country. They borrow money and give it to us so that we can build our city. The cost of borrowing money is high and this is the reason why we can't borrow money and build all the cities in the country at the same time. The cost of borrowing the money is around 10-15,000% so it is really expensive to use our money to build because we will end up losing money. The only way the money to build will be spent is if we decide for it.<n><n>Input: What is the minimum wage of a person

The rules are this: Each player is given 15 cards to get 6 cards. If one player gets all 6 cards, his first action is to give those cards to the other player. The other player receives only those cards remaining in his deck and can not give them to the first player until he has played one of his own.<n>Once the first player has played that many cards, his next action is to pass those cards between his two cards. The cards are returned only if that player has a card left in his deck. If his first action is to pass that many cards to the other player, he has to ask the first player if the remaining cards could go on him or the second player. The first player cannot pass those cards to both the second player and the other player until he has played the last card in his deck. The last card could be from one of the two players or could be from the first player. After being able to give that last card, the first player must use the last card of his deck to decide what the next action will be.<n>The cards are not returned until the first player has either reached 11 or 15 cards or has passed those cards to the other playing. The first player wins by passing cards and the other player must reach 11 or 15 cards in his hand to win.

The blizzard lasted for two days and was followed by a heavy night falling. The boy started to lose his footing, until he reached the bottom of the hill. But the snow was still very thick, and he began walking faster. Then he tripped and fell forward, and he started sliding a lot. The boy's parents stopped him so he could get up. He got to his feet and started to move forward, but ran into a branch and fell forward again. His parents kept up with him for two hours, but eventually he stopped moving forward. When his parents asked, he said he didn't want to get trapped in the snow anymore. Then they left. The boy is now stuck in the snow for a week.<n>Out of the snow, it was very cold, so the boy started making a fire in the cave with his clothes. When the fire reached a certain point, it blew out when the snow hit the cave. The fire caught on fire, and eventually the boy got the fire going again. His parents never brought him home again, or found out how they got stuck in the snow. The boy's parents went to the police, but were told that they could not do anything before the snow had cleared out. All they could do was ask him to stay inside.<n>So the final result was that he was trapped in the snow for a whole week. Every day, he got colder until he died of exhaustion, due to the lack of food. In the end, he died from starvation caused by the lack of food.<n>Conclusion:If you were trapped in the snow over a long period of time and were unable to move forward, and the police couldn't find you in the end, how would you feel?<n><n>Input:Two brothers walk onto a baseball diamond for a game.

The inventor was named Jerry. The device was named "walk" due to the fact that the invention created the ability to walk backwards forever.  What do you think Jerry's job was?<n>Output: As I mentioned previously, Jerry was an inventor. He invented the device. The device had two wheels and a handle. There was also a bell to tell you when you were walking backward.  The device was a success because people believed the device would never be broken. Therefore, no one wanted to put a stop to it.  So the device was never used, but people still thought they had made it.  Then, one day, Jerry was asked what the device was really used for. He responded that it was only really used for backwards people to look around at themselves. When he asked why, he was told that they didn’t like to look up.  Since no one wanted to stop the invention, the inventor had no choice but to continue.  Eventually, the inventor realized that his invention wasn’t good to start with and stopped. What was his job after that?<n>Output: It's difficult to say if Jerry was ever a successful inventor. He might have been a more reliable inventor than he had ever shown before.  All we're sure of is that he had a good invention for a very short time.<n><n>Input: John was a writer at the company he worked at.

Launch all four people into space. Launch three more people into space.

It flew on Monday last week!!!"<n><n> I say: "That's because you only count the days."<n><n> Now, she says: "Oh yeah, I thought it was an ant!"<n><n> What is the best way to explain to my friend what an ant is, what's it's role in nature or the world, and why a 5 year old girl would know what it's role in nature and why a 5 yearold girl would know that it's role in nature?<n>Output: You could tell them that ant isn't a thing that exists on its own. You could tell them that ants use their size and their abilities in their community to create a community and that their existence is a kind of life extension, giving life to every part of nature. You can explain the different kinds of ants and what each can do for the world. You can tell them that a colony is a collection of ants that get along together, not just the individual ants, and then you can describe how ants use their size to create their community. Finally, you can tell them that ants have an ability to live for hundreds of years and that all of nature is built by ants. You could add that the world is built not just by ants but also by everything, because it's not made of just insects but of the organisms in the atmosphere.<n><n> I also had to tell them what an ant is. Now here where I live, the weather is too unpredictable to use my word, so I have to explain in other ways. In my mind, an

There is no right or wrong. It is between $400 and $410. The way I worked out it I took the total from this question and divided by two and the total from this question divided by two and the net amount was $410. So, the answer is 410 divided by two divided by 4 divided by 7 (4 people) divided by 15 (15 people) so the answer is 410 divided into $4 divided by 2. The answer, "40," corresponds to a net of $4 divided by 15 divided by 4 divided by 35 divided by 45 divided by 55 divided by 75. So, the answer number is 425 divided by 4 divided by 15 divided by 35 divided by 35 divided by 15 = 425 divided by 4 divided into $395. You got 425 divided by 4 divided the net amount. So, the answer, "40.," is correct.

He has a small staff that only works part time. He has no retirement plan or insurance. If Congress passes a long-term savings program, it will cost approximately $1 million, and he expects to save $1 million. He plans to take home $600,000 as his salary. If there is no long-term savings program and there is no cost reduction or benefit program, the savings will be $600,000. Therefore, the federal government must fund these programs and will take in $600,000 each year. The president must pay taxes on the $600,000, but his total income could be $800,000 for one year. If there is no cost reduction, he will take home $800,000 and will be a millionaire. If there is a cost reduction or benefit program that would reduce the amount of taxes he must pay, then $600,000 will remain in his income over the year so there would be no net change in his net worth. Which type of plan would increase his net worth the most?<n><n>Output: The average family spends about $5,500 on clothing per year. By saving $100 and spending $10,000 over five years, a family would have $120,000 to spend on clothing.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:What does one chop us a grape for? Choices:  A: fresh fruit B: wine press C: fruit basket D: fruit cocktail E: picnic basket<n>Output:		 Chopped grape - $0.42 grape = $10.12 chopped grape / 3 = $72 chopped grape / 1 = $18.75 grape = $14.50 grapefruit / 8 = $36.75 grapefruit/8 = $0.77<n>So an investment of $10.12 per grape means $72/8 = $18.75 + $4.75 + $3.75 = $36.75<n>Since you are paying $12.00 per grape then the profit is $4.25 = $3.75 / $8.50 = $17.75 total ($4.25/3.75).<n>So the final answer would be 7<n><n>Input:A man was walking on the beach early one morning and saw a man on a fishing boat. The fisherman told him that he could get him a fish, just take $2. So the man got up and went behind a nearby log and caught a fish. While walking away, he spotted an open chest and went inside to bring out a $1 coin, take this money and buy a lobster. He was shocked to find that the lobster was as big as he was so he carried it back across the beach to the fisherman. The fisherman told him to get a beer. The man did so and was able to fish 5 more lobsters without attracting any attention. He then caught another lobster, placed it in his pocket and went back on the beach and went fishing. He saw another lobster there so he decided to put the two together and go fishing again. They caught another 10 lobsters so he put 2 per lobster. They even put up some fishing flags to attract more fishermen. The boat captain had an idea to get people to go fishing by giving them a fish. The man got out his pocket and produced $1 coins. He handed the coins to the fishermen, saying, “Take this coin and you go catch a fish and bring back a lobster. When your lobster comes back, put this coin back in your pocket. Then return the coin with a note inside (‘Thank you, have a fish’). ” Then he walked away from the spot where the fishermen were fishing and returned to the beach. When he returned, he noticed that some fishermen from the first trip had caught their first lobster. The fishermen had gone home without their pay but their money was still there. The businessman then realized that no one bothered to check on that group. Then he started fishing. He started to go over

The book ends with a wedding. But the main problem is that the baby has to stay in the womb for 9 months. A little boy decides to help out. So he decided to leave the house early, so his mother would not have to stay at home all day. The baby decided to stay up late and sleep the night before. Then, he called his mother on the way home from work and said, "I’ll walk you to your car." The mother thought that the baby was too young to walk and he was going to go and tell someone to take him to school, so she told him that he should come home instead. So the baby called home from school and left and walked about a mile by himself and got home just in time for his mother to start working. The girl is a little scared of her baby but thinks it’s funny, so she lets him stay home while she shops. After shopping the baby came back and walked with his mother. After the baby was old enough to walk, he asked if he could stop shopping.<n><n>Output: The baby has to stay in front of the car; he has to listen and keep an eye on his mother, who is a little worried, because there has been only 1 baby so far.

So the baby has to stay home until his mother has been pregnant for a week; since his mother had been working every day, only 2 days have passed since she got home. The baby can stay in front of the house with his mother for about 2 1/2 hours more; if he has a bad day, the mother can put him in the house so that he doesn’t get to know his neighbors too well. As his mother is leaving to go to work, he comes with her to use the phone.<n><n>Input:A movie takes place on a boat; this movie features Jack Nicholson and Julia Roberts, who are in love with each other.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:What is someone likely to feel after receiving a gift that is not common? Choices:  A: special B: personal C: offended D: unique E: rare<n>Output:		 Special, unique, offended, and rare all have the same amount of value. So the final answer is common<n><n>Input:If you buy a car, you can get the car wash done for 50 cents a day. How much will you earn from the car wash?<n>Output:You get $200.00 if you use your own car wash kit.<n>You get $50.00 if you use the car wash from a repair shop.<n>You get $15.00 if you use a car washer that is installed at a car wash.<n>The car wash cost $1700.<n>Start by figuring out how much you think you will earn from the car wash and subtract that from the total cost. The total amount left is $1699. If you divide that by (1699 * 100 = 1290), then you will get ($1699 / 1290) = $10.67. That total value will be the money you will earn from the vehicle wash.<n>From there, divide that amount by $34.17 (the difference between a car wash and repair shop value) and you will get the money you will pay for the car wash. So the final answer to the car wash question is $10 + $34.17 = $5.25<n><n>Input:What amount of cash is needed to buy a car? The answer is $100. Cash is given to each person on the day of the car deal.<n>Input:What amount are the car dealer's required to pay the first customer to drive away with a vehicle they are selling? They get $800.00. What is the total amount required to buy a car? It is calculated by finding the total cash that needs to be given as the first customer is driving away.<n>Input:To buy a vehicle, the first person must have $800.00 in cash. This amount is split equally between the seller. The remaining amount will be split equally between the buyer.<n>Input:What is the price that a potential seller is willing to pay to receive a car? It is determined by dividing the price of a car by the potential buyer's total need for a vehicle.<n>Input:To sell a vehicle, sellers must be willing to give up $800.00.<n>Input:What happens to a buyer who finds a car that he or she wants? They can keep the vehicle; they buy it, or they give some of the vehicle to the second buyer.<n>How much money was needed to buy the car

I will break up the long answer into 7-10 smaller sections.<n>Question authority is important to remember because when people travel on liquids (as in, on liquid), one can find the most answers quickly. In fact, the best place to look for an answer is at the front of the boat, where you would expect to see the name of the boat.<n>High fives are important to remember. However, I will explain this as a fact instead of a question so you can decide the answer when thinking about it.<n>The most expensive item in the world is a watch. A watch is something people buy as "something nice to have." A watch contains the hands and the time indicator. A watch that does not have a movement will last a lifetime. As time runs out and the clock stops, a watch becomes worthless.<n>The most dangerous time is when you are traveling long distances. When a person is traveling an hour and a half, the time change in the location and therefore the time that you are in is a great source of danger.<n>To find and answer a question, a person needs to ask a series of questions in their minds. For example, instead of asking how long it is until the sun rises today, a person should ask how long it is until a watch will run out of batteries. Another question that may be useful to ask is, "If the sun shines on the watch at 7 in the morning, how long will it last until it starts to run out of batteries?" A person's answer to this question determines how long the watch will last and their budget is affected by it.<n>Learn from the other 5. Ask yourself more questions to see if you can find any answers and you might get more than one answer.<n><n>Input:Which of the following are NOT the 4 "Famous people?"

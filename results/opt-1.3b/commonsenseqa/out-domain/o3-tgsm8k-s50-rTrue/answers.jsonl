Alice decided to say no because she was afraid that Jerry would like the fish much more than her and she thought it was rude to do that, so she asked Bill to do it.

When Bill ordered fish, the waiter called Jerry from the back room to ask him which fish he wanted. Before Bill could answer the waiter, David asked for the salmon.

{"text": "A = sadness B = bills C = happiness D = frustration\nFor the emotion that leads to happiness, I would suggest feeling like you have accomplished something. So if you were paid by a company and decided to use the money you saved on whatever you want you can do now. This is really just showing that the money doesn't matter, it's the accomplishment. The emotions of sadness or frustration are feelings of dissatisfaction or rejection which are unachievable goals. So in that example, when you buy a car, it means you have something valuable instead of receiving nothing in return.\nFor the emotion that results in sorrow then feel a fear of not giving enough and then regretting wasting the money. For example, if you saved $100,000 and used it to buy a house for your family what would you regret? If you regret having spent that money I would suggest you spent it on making the family more independent. This way you're spending the money on their future and not only for your family.

The eye is so bright, that a tiny bit of light from the sun is reflected into the eye of the cat. The cat has a perfect sight, while the mirror in the room is reflecting only half the sunlight into the cat's eye and only half the sunlight is visible from the cat's point of view. Which color of cat\u2019s eye is brighter \u2013 the one on the side of the cat or the one on the front?\nOutput: The one on the side.\n\nInput: When the light beam is reflected through a piece of metal, only about 10% of the light is reflected back through the metal. Since most of the light is reflected through the metal, the total reflection is 10%. The percentage of reflected light increases as the light distance is longer. A light beam that\u2019s 6 feet long and travels 10 feet away will have 10% reflected light. If the beam is six feet long and travels eight feet away, then the beam will have 40%. For each increase in the beam's distance, the reflected light increases 10%.\nOutput: The beam has 10% reflected light, hence 10% of the total beam's light will be refracted. All light that is refracted, is 90% reflected, and 90% of the total reflected light is 90% refracted.\nNow the beam is at maximum deflection. You have now seen the beam traveling a very long distance through the air.

{"text": "All options work. Each option is either correct or incorrect. One answer is incorrect. Each option has to be discussed in the order given.\n\nIn my last post, I said that if you're rich, you're less likely to experience divorce. However, if you're poor, you have an 85 to 96% chance of getting divorced, but most people who get divorced are rich. A better explanation is that it's not the divorce itself that causes it, but rather the loss of the common sense, that makes people poor. So, if someone gets divorced, it's more likely to result from a marriage of convenience, but if it wasn't a marriage of convenience, it wouldn't have resulted in a divorce. Also, if the marriage of convenience had succeeded and ended on good terms, then the couple would have still ended up poor.\n\nInput: Jane is a waitress. She is a good waitress because she is very good at her job. In the past, one of her coworkers told Jane that they didn't like Jane much. She tried to fix the situation by helping the coworker by paying more and more money. But Jane's coworkers didn't notice Jane's extra spending. Later, Jane's employer asked Jane whether she could afford a raise, and Jane said she could. While the money was there, Jane bought expensive clothes and purses. So Jane spent money. Jane had $500 left over after paying for her clothes and car. She decided to buy presents for her kids. So Jane spent $500 on presents for her children because there was a budget of $500 for the children.\nOutput: Jane bought $250 worth of presents for the children. She used the rest of her money to pay herself for her mistakes.\nSo Jane wasted about $250. If Jane had spent more money on her kids, she would have used up the whole 500.

Now you can estimate how much that will be over time because X has not happened yet. So ask, how long will it take for X to happen?\nOutput: The total will be x/2^(X/4) = <y.x^2/4> x = y/2^(-2Y/4) = x/y/3\nY is the number of months in 5 years. 4 is a natural number because of 4 + 3, and 2 is a natural number because 2/3 = 1/3. 1 is a natural number because it is the prime number. So by definition the sum of all factors of 5 will be 5, but the total will be <5/2^x/2> = x/4^(Y/4).\nSo the real answer is X is going to be <5/2>/y/4> x is going to be <2/3>/5 x/2^x/4 x/x^x^2 x divided by 2 is <5/2^(Y/4)/(2+5)/(0) = 2^(Y/4)+5^(Y/4) x/2^(5^(Y/3)) x/x^2 x/5^2 x/5/2 = <6/5^y/2> 4 x/2^(1^5^(Y/2)) x = 1/5x/6 x/2^(2^y/2)*2 = 6\nSo the final answer should be 6\n\nInput:An airline provides two different tickets at different prices.

This works out to $20.70 per stick.\nAnd now I have $10 left to pay for milk.\nAt the farmer's market, I will buy three sticks, each with three gallons of milk ($60 each):\n1. 80 sticks = $80 ($60 x 3 = $240)\n3. 80 sticks + 2 gallons = $96 ($10 x 10 = $48)\n8 sticks = $240 ($1 x 8 = $30)\n12 sticks = $480 ($8 x 12 = $64)\n16 sticks = $720 ($32 x 16 = $108)\nSo I have $120 left to buy milk.\nIf I bought the sticks from the apiary for $2 and the farmer's market for $2, I will have $100 with which to buy milk:\nI will buy the sticks from the apiarist for $5 if I buy one jar and stick.\n\nInput: (1) You can rent a small house by $10 a day, but you have to pay the utilities.

Jesus asked Peter if he too had eaten. Peter said that Mary had eaten and he himself had not. Jesus said he would tell Mary his story.

{"text": "A\nThe last answer is correct.\n\nInput:A group of six friends planned. The vehicle they purchased was $1700. The members of this car group pay $1200 for the car. One member buys a $1000 car at a garage sale for the sale price. The group members all drive around town in their cars for ten minutes. How long will it take for every one of them to fill up on gas? Why is this a problem?\nOutput: The total number of gallons left is 1000. The group of 6 does not drive over 40 minutes. In fact, they average around 2.5 gallons per person per trip. Since they were driving for ten minutes, 20 gallons left = 1000 x 2000 = 20000. Thus an average of 2000 gallons per individual will fill up a full tank in ten minutes. The individual who bought the $10 car will have 20000 gallons left in his car. The total amount will be $2000 dollars. That will take about 12 hours of fuel to fill up the car. This is a problem.\n\nInput:Two parents had a fight and the mother left their house. She said to the father that she will pay back the money she borrowed from him for the fight. The father paid her $1200 back and asked the mother to stop making the payments. What is the amount of money the mother owes the father?\nOutput: The payment was $1200. Since the payment was made two years ago, the payment was backdated.\nThe amount owed is $1200. If that had been a month ago, the payment would have only been $800 which is four days' worth of her wages. Therefore, it would not be a huge problem. Just a couple days' pay. However, this is in addition to the debt with the car. Since they have five children, that's four days of school, five days of sports, and about $200 worth of toys etc. They owe about $2500 dollars. The amount that she owes is over $2,500. They owe her about 50 payments of $800 dollars and they are currently paying her another $1200 a month on an installment plan. So the total amount that she owes is $3,600.\nThey owe her about 50 payments total. She owes them $1500. They will be out $1600 bucks a month for thirty payments.\nThe total amount that she owes her parents is $3,600\n\nInput:If you could buy your choice of four items and bring them back to", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

Children were to write a letter to the parent of their choice saying what they liked or didn't like about the teacher.    Each child with a winning letter would be sent one ticket to the contest.    So every letter had to include a number, but all different letters would have a different number.    Students filled out the school forms to submit their letters with their school tickets.    The only difference is that only one letter was needed.    In the morning of voting day, each child had five school tickets to hand out to their friends.    The school officials tallied the ballots, and the children with the winning letters were awarded the tickets to go to Hawaii.   So each child with one winning letter got to go to Hawaii, and the child with the most votes would get the prize and receive an honorable mention from the officials.  So at the end of the day every child with a winning letter got to go.   So the students who got all five winning tickets would go.    So the parent voted for their children and gave them the winning tickets for all their friends.   So the parents with five winning tickets won one of the prizes.

There is an anonymous mail service that will send one ticket for a $20 gift card.\nSo each student received one ticket for $20.   If the two of the tickets to Hawaii were sold the winner would receive $40.   In order for this plan to work the parents would need two parents to vote for their children.

The total salary of the corporation is $150,000\nSince $> $50, 000, then the salary of the company is equal to $150,000.\nSince $150,000 is equal to $50,000, then the salary of each salary at the corporation is equal to $150k\nSince $50,000 + $150,000 = $150,000, then the salaries are equal to $150k.\nSince $150k = $50,000, the salary of the founder is equal to $200,000, so his total salary is $250,000\nSince $250,000 = < $50,000, his salary is equal to $50k. He is unemployed and has $50,000 to invest\nSince $50k + $50+$100k = $250k, his salary is equal of $500k. He owns the corporation and has a new salary\nThus his salary of $500k = $10k\nSince $10k = $50k, he is unemployed and has $25,000 to invest. Therefore, his savings has increased\nSince $25k + $50k = $50k\nThus his savings is now $50,000.\nSince the salaries are equal to each other, the total is $150k\nSo the final answer with the above answers is $200,000\n\nInput: P.

She is the second woman to ever go to space and she will become the first American woman to ever go into space. Every time an astronaut reaches a new orbit, she has to push her space vehicle forward to reduce friction.\nThe ship is on earth and she is near the center of gravity. As the astronaut lowers her arm off her spacecraft the ship speeds up, which makes it harder to push the ship forward. When the astronaut lowers her arm near the center of gravity she can move her arm up and down on the ship. At 50 kms from the Earth, the shuttle vehicle speeds up again and when the astronaut lowers her arm the shuttle speeds up to 70 kms. She pushes her spacecraft forward, which decelerates the shuttle and increases the thrust. As the shuttle slows down its arm moves to her shoulder and her arm reaches down to touch the ship again. She pushes the shuttle forward, which reduces the forward momentum of the shuttle and increases the spacecraft's forward momentum. At 70 kms the shuttle reaches 60 kms, then 67 kms and is above 80 kms when she lowers her arm. The shuttle then slows down in altitude slightly to 0.3 kms, but the arm reaches out even faster than when she pushed the spacecraft forward and pushes the shuttle faster to 90 kms. As she stops lowering the space vehicle and the thrusters stop running, she is in orbit with her arm resting on the shuttle. What is the final force she has to apply for the shuttle to reach its full height?\nOutput: The final force applied in reaching her full height can be calculated as:\nF = F-F-F + F-F-F = N + F + F-F = N+F-F = FN+F-F = N+N-F= FFN+F-F= FN+1\nSo the final answer of:\nF = F + F-F- F-F = N + N + F- F- F-F = FN + F-F- 1\nis correct.\n\nInput and Answer:In the game, a group of five people plan to visit the tallest mountain in the world.

One person takes extra strokes for putting, the next takes extra strokes for putting after hitting, they both take extra strokes for putting after walking, etc. If they get even scores, their scores should be equal. If they get one-over, their scores should be added and their scores should be averaged. If both golfers get an even score on the same hole, the person who took the extra stroke will be the person to get a bonus stroke on the next hole.\nEach golfer takes an extra stroke on the hole if they had to putt (putting after hitting, putting after walking), or if they took extra strokes because of walking on a green. Each golfer should get a bonus stroke on every hole.\nBoth golfers should take extra strokes if they hit into the pond, hit into a water hazard, hit beyond the par 3 boundary, hit into a hazard that is over 4 feet deep in the fairway, hit into a par 3 where there is no green, hit into a hazard with water on the bank, or into a hazard that is more than 4 feet deep in the hole.\nIf someone has to take more strokes, the score should be averaged.\nIf someone has a handicap of 35, they should play against handicaps of 35+. If someone has a handicap that is too high, the scores should not be averaged\nEach golfer's average score should add up to 35.\nEach golfer's handicap should count the same as his or her player score because one handicap score will be a negative score, and the total score added will count negative as well, and add back the average score from each player.\nIf both golfers take extra strokes in this way, then the bonus stroke will count just as the other players, but it should be subtracted from the total score so that only the golfer with negative scores will be penalized for extra strokes on the same hole because his or her handicap will be lower than the golfer who was penalized.\nThe rules are as follows:\nA player who has to take extra strokes in this manner loses", "answer": "E: class room"}

{"text": "Nothing else was expected except good grades.\n\nInput:If a person is willing to pay $5.00 for a new book, is it fair to expect them to pay more for used books? The answer depends on the condition of the book. One book used for $1.00 might not have many dust jackets or pages, but would not be as clean. Another used book might have the dust jackets, but most pages are tattered as well. The remaining pages could be worn, faded, or torn, or both. The person buying the book may also choose to buy a used book as well, while the person giving the book away may choose to sell it to someone who will use it or donate it to another school. If the book does not have much pages or dust jacket and is good as new, then it is fair to expect the person selling to pay more. If the book is used for a low price and looks ok, then it would be ok to offer the book for sale at $2.00 each. The person giving the book away might choose to give the book for free to someone else, but if they do this people are usually willing to pay a premium price for the free book, giving them an additional $2.00. The person selling might also choose to give the book away for free, but people are also sometimes willing to pay a premium for a used book. If the book is worth less than the amount of donation charges, the person who wanted to be fair in pricing their book may choose to buy the book for what they were willing to pay for the book in the first place. If the book is more expensive than the cost of the book, then it is fair for everyone to ask the person who wants to buy the book to pay more. Any price higher than the cost of the initial book costs is a bit of a discount.\n\nInput:What\u2019s the difference in hours between John, Jane, Mary and Bob?

The average weight for the average American is about 180 pounds, so how much rice is consumed in total for each meal?\nOutput: Based on the data supplied I calculated how many meals each person in the United States consumes, and the average volume of rice consumed per meal is 7 pounds.\nThe average volume is 7 pounds for a man or 2.5lbs for a woman.\nThus I calculated how much rice Americans eat,\nIncluding breakfast this comes to an average of 3.2 cups per person per day\nOf course if you add the weight of tea and coffee to this rice, or if you add in drinks you have a total of 5.9 cups per person daily\nThus I calculated how many cups per day per person\nThus I got 17.6 cups\nThus I calculated how often Americans eat rice\nThus I calculated how frequently Americans eat rice per year\nThus I calculated how frequent Americans eat rice per second\nThus I calculated how rarely is rice eaten\nThus I calculated how very rare is eating rice every day\nThus I calculated how rare is rice every day\nThus if you add up the numbers and divide by the estimated number of hours Americans eat rice per year divided by the estimated number of meals Americans eat rice per year per day per year the amount of rice will be 14.0 lbs per year * 1.55 = 14.0 lbs\nThus the average person eats 14.0 lbs of rice each day, or more than 8 meals\nThus the average person needs about 18% of their body weight for rice and only 18% of their body body weight for other foods\nThus the average person is 3.2% overweight\nNote: In the real world, this is a pretty accurate number - in the real world, adults are about 2.5 times bigger than kids and girls are about 2 times bigger than guys", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

{"text": "Choose two of the items in the first two boxes or none of them if you wish\n\nInput: The U.S. has a deficit of $300,000,000. The deficit may worsen if the government\u2019s debt is $300,000,500. The government needs to lower its debts before this happens. For example, the government could sell its assets at a substantial discount to its worth, and raise taxes on those who currently hold assets like stocks or bonds and invest the proceeds in government bonds. How much more is the government going to need, and how long will it take to get the deficit under control?\nOutput: $300,000,00 is 1/3rd of the deficit so they get $100,000,000, for a total of $200,000,000\nThe deficit won't go down until government bonds go down, which is also estimated over several years\nIt will be a very slow process, so the deficit does not need to be reduced so fast, perhaps 3-5 years\nThe government will require about $200,000,5,000 to reduce its deficit\nAbout half of this will come from selling assets of stock and bonds at a discount\n\nInput: A company wants to raise $200,000,00 in capital. They plan to sell 4,000 shares of 1 million shares each at prices ranging from $1000 to $15000. Each dollar should be worth $200. Who will be buying these shares, and how much will they be paying to purchase them? There are 1.4 million shares of 100 shares at $3000. They are $1500 apiece. So at the $3000 price, the buyer might pay $3000. The stock may take up to 6 months to sell, so the buyer will buy the stock at the low price of $1000.\nOutput: The buyers will buy 4,000,000 shares at $10000 = $<<30000/4000=1000>>1000 = 500.\nSo the buyers will pay $100,000,5,500 for 200,000 shares of stock, or $<<100,000,5.5>5,500 = 500\nWhich one of the following statements is true?\na) Share prices are expected to fall and not increase\nb) Shares will rise with the price.\nc) The company will not know prices until they are bought\nd) The government will not buy stock in the company\n\nInput: A baby boy was born on June 22", "answer": "A: relaxation"}

Shower shower storage of a double edge shaving kit will likely be stored in the bathroom.

Your father would need to wash and pair each shirt, and then wash each shirt twice more. Since the shirt would cost $100, your father would either need to buy an extra shirt every week, or use a different shirt. In the average adult's clothing budget, only one extra washing and matching of clothes happens every two weeks, for a total of five washing, matching and drying. Therefore, his new shirt is approximately $20 per wear, $100 times five (or 20 / 12 = 12 dollars) equals $4,240. He can spend $1000/year on clothes, and in the last ten years he could have bought $1,240 worth of clothes. Using a conservative 20 / 12 rule, that would work out to $1/year per year in excess clothes money. So if you're your father, you can spend $1100/year on clothes. You could give your dad the shirt that is missing so he has eight shirts for $400 = $400/10 = $600.\nOutput: If you can wash and matching your dad's 8 extra shirts, he would make $600. So $600 for eight shirts = $200 for 8 shirts = $600 = $600.\n\nInput:A group of five friends plans to get new shoes, and everyone wants to get a different pair of shoes.

So you would need to read a total of 5,000 words. Each sentence in your story should contain 1 or more words. The number of words that fit in a sentence are known as words per sentence, or word. So 2 would be 3 or 4, 2 would be 6 or 7, 1 would be 12, etc. So the total of the word count is 3,000.\nOutput:2,000 words = 2,000 divided by 3,000 is 1,500 words, so 500 divided by 2,000 is 500 per sentence.\n\nInput:One day, you are given a choice to write 10 short stories on a topic that is meaningful.

If he could not come up with any money by the time they left, his girlfriend would have to find work and the group would lose the money they agreed to pay him.\nThe group of friends was afraid of losing the money because it was from a school project. James wanted to go to the beach and take pictures, so he would still have a camera to take the pictures with along with him.  He did not feel pressure because he didn't have to pay for anything because of the school project.  He just felt that his friends felt bad about losing money because they knew that he was going to have to pay for something.\nThe group left the school and went down to the pier. Once they were able to find someone who would take pictures for them, James was asked to take pictures of them with the camera. James felt pressured because it was the first time he was going to have someone other than his friends take pictures of him.  He knew that someone would not be able to take good quality pictures.

If he accepts the raise, how much should he work? Calculate the average raise and divide by the hours to get that many hours.\nOutput: Total time for a new employee to get a one-month raise is approximately:  3 x (8 hours \u2013 8) = 2.5 x 2.5 = 4  hours (3.6 x 80 x 30 = 90 hours)\nThe employee worked an average of 60 hours per week in order to get a 5% raise. So the employee earned 5.6 hours per week for her time. If a new employee works an average of 60 hours, the average increase is 45%, or about $25 per hour, to $75.25 per hour.\nOutput: Average wage for new employee at 5% raise is $7500, or $65 an hour. Divide 75 x $ 65 x $325 = $7500. So the employee earned 85 hours at the new wage, or $65 an HOUR.\nSo the new pay for the new employee is about $7500 per year.\nSo the average net pay for the new employee at the new wage is about $3750 per year.\n\nInput:There are five employees hired for 30 days at $1,000 each.

Therefore each employee would receive 1/3 the normal training allowance. The total cost of the training would be $2000, or half the normal allowance.\nOutput: Total training cost for 30 hours of training is $2000, or $150 an hour.\nIf the time required for training is 3.3 days, then training would cost $1800. Therefore training costs $750 per employee.\nSo training costs per employee are $1200 (50 x $1000 = $1200)\nSo training costs $750 per employer.\nSo the net cost is $1000 per employer.\nSo this is how expensive it is", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

The birds, the fish, the jellyfish, the stingrays, and all the other big things that live in the water are on the beach when you get there. Because the people aren't in their houses on the beach, you can't really see the animals. The animals like to be near people and they feel safer near people. They live in houses on the beach because they are safer that way. They can go where they want and they aren't afraid of predators and they get to eat and play. If people were actually on the beach most of it wouldn't matter the animals lived there, but because they live on the beach it matters.\nInput: You are invited to a barbecue while you are on vacation\nOutput: You are completely lost", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

The group has been searching for a car for four years, they have a total of $15k. Each friend in the group is saving $1000 for two years, they each receive $1500. For example, when the final friend decides to buy a car, they divide the cost equally $1500/2 = $<<1500/2=1200>>1200. So the final four people will now have $600 saved. So the six friends are now saved $800 and $1200 so a net saving of $1200. Thus they are now equal, saving $1200, therefore they should split the saving equal between themselves. So the final four must pay $1200 / 2 = $100/2 = $200/ 2. So the final four have to pay $200 / 2 = >>200/ 2 = $400 so the final four have to share their savings at $200 / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100. So the final four should each pay $40/2 = >>40/ 2 = $160 so the final four have share $160/2 = $<<160/2=75>>75. So the final four now jointly share in the savings, thus the final four now have $200/2 = <<200/2 = 75>>75 sharing their savings equally for the net savings of $150, thus they should be equal, saving an equal share in the savings, $150\nSo the final answer to this is 125\n\nInput:Two people are at a store when a customer comes in and starts to buy groceries.

{"text": "None of the options came on the TV\n\nInput: The number of people in the house depends on the cost.\nOutput: None of these will work as the numbers are close, so a new equation will be needed.\nInput: Cost = CostOfFood(FoodCost)\nOutput:Cost = CostOfWater(WaterCost)\nSo we want to know how much food and how much water are needed to feed one person for 24 hours. We need to calculate CostOfFood and CostOfWater (and the number of people that the food will feed).\nSo first we take the FoodCost and add it to CostOfWater. Then we subtract CostOfFood. And then we sum CostOfFood to CostOfWater.\nIf we had $1000 in our house then we'd subtract Cost ofWater - CostOfFood to find that CostOfFood would be $300. Since we have only $99 in our house, we'll use the $99 cost.\nNow we take the other two costs. CostOfFood = CostOfWater + CostOfFood. Now we subtract $300 - $99 from CostOfFood.\nIf we subtract $300 from CostOfWater, we take the other $300 from CostOfFood. Then we add the remaining $900 to the other two costs to calculate the $1200 CostOfFood and $1200 CostOfWater. Finally we round up to the nearest dollar and divide the remaining $900.\nNow, we simply find the total of $1200 in our house, and divide it by $1200/6 = $1200/36 hours. That gives us the number of people that our food will feed. And then we take the number of people that Water will feed, and figure OutWhatIf which is the number of people that we think we'd lose if our power and our water went out, and divide by the number of hours that our food will feed them.", "answer": "A: advisory"}

When my daughter asked why they never get the glasses, he said that he didn't know and that he doesn't want them anyhow because their sister had them.\n2nd answer = She asked everyone! I think that is a good question because they both got glasses. Each of them got the glasses for their different needs.

Choose this answer if you know the origin: \"Nausea is a symptom of a serious medical condition \u2014 vomiting \u2014 usually accompanied by abdominal pain and nausea. It occurs when the digestive system is not receiving enough nutrients for proper digestion and functioning. [1]. The word \"nausea,\" derived from the Latin noun nausea, originally meant \"a feeling of sick or sickening.\" It entered common parlance in mid-18th century France in the context of food as an ill-effects of eating; its first documented use was in the 1750s in a translation of Cicero's Politics.[1] It is unclear when the expression \"nausea,\" coined when the word \"nause\" was used as a noun, became used to refer to a specific cause, but it is fairly widespread today. \"It has been argued that the first recorded use of the term \"nausea\" in literature was in the English poet John Keats' first-century poem, The Odyssey, where it means \"fear, trembling or ill.\" [1]\nOutput: \"Nausea\" was a part of the common lexicological lexicon by the late 18th century. In the 1860s, \"nausea,\" as a noun, refers to \"a severe vomiting and diarrhea episode.\" [4][3] In the 1930s, it was commonly used as a noun describing diarrhea. [5] Usage began to decline in the 1950s and 1960s; by the 1970s, the term had disappeared from use.[6]\n\nInput: A person was born blind and his mother said he would never read books, as he was not a \"bookworm\" (from a French bookworm \"to understand how books are written\") but he loved to be around books.

How could I be born blind and not be educated around books? I will never read.\"\nBut when the grandmother thought it over, she remembered that she had not read himself a book since she was a child.

The teacher asked all the students to think about why one of them wasn\u2019t on the math team. The question was \u201cWould you give a $5 bet to the person who was the worst and said they were the best?\u201d Each student could think of a reason why. The teacher offered a $5 bet because he thought students were much better athletes if they were better athletes than they were sportspeople. So, the teacher offered the $5 bet to John who was the worst and would give him the $5. John quickly agreed, but the rest of the class voted against him. What was supposed to happen?\nOutput: John agreed to give $5 to the teacher because he thought it was unfair and unfair is bad.\nJohn was a terrible athlete. His team lost every game, not one team won. He thought if he was more athletic, then people would be better at giving him a $5 bet. So he thought it was important that people wanted to give him a $5 bet because if someone did, then they would probably want to give him a $10 bet or maybe even a $20 bet also. And if John had a good reputation the money would be more likely to come his way in bets. So, the $5 bet was a mistake. He was a poor student because he never worked hard to help others. He thought that if people were nicer to him, then he would help them. He thought that if he gave other people money, then they would help him, too.\n\nIf the teacher had said that he offered $5 to the person who was bad, and the class had said that they offered $5 to the people who said that they were not the bottom, would it be correct to put John's reply in the right column and John's reply in the left column?\nOutput:\nThat was a bad idea because students think money comes from things that are good and money can come from bad things. They think that money can come from all kinds of things, even from bad", "answer": "C: knowlege"}

A: In the long jump the goal is to land three different times (four if you are a sprinter), so the time it takes for an athlete to jump is usually around one minute. The distance in the short jump is usually around five yards. A long jump is a race. There is a goal of landing four different times in the race. If you do not land, no longer than 3 times, your time is wasted. If you land less than 3 times in the race, that means you need to improve your technique, work out more, etc.\nOutput: In the long jump, the goal is to land four times (four if you will be a sprinter). So the time it takes for the athlete to jump is usually one minute. The distance is usually three yards. The difference between the time it takes to jump in both the long and short jump is roughly 30 seconds, so the difference in distance between the 2 events is roughly one yard.\n\nInput:In the short jump, the athletes have to jump at least three times in order for their score to count. Therefore, the time it takes to perform each jump is 2 minutes. In the long jump, however, the goal is to perform four or more jumps. This is why the distance in the long jump is about 50 yards.

There first choice is a group of four letters, they then write one word with the four letters as their words. Answers to the first three questions can be obtained by counting the number of letters in a word: B1, B2, B3 and B4 and a group of four letter words can be written with 4 letters. B1 will not be the same as A1. There is no way that B1 can be A1. So there are only 2 ways that B2 can be A2 and these are: A1 + B2 = B3 + A1 or A2 + B3. There are 4 ways that B4 can be A2. The letters B, B1, B2 and B3 are the only 5 letters that will make a B3. The 6th letter is O and it will make the word B4. So B4 is not in the same order as A2 and A1. The letters A, A1, A2 and A3 can be taken with two of the top 3 letters. There is only three letter combinations that can put an 8 into the order. This is not possible with the four letter combinations: A2 + B1 + B2 = A4. There are 5 combinations possible with two letters that will make an 8: a2 + A3 + A6 + A7\nInput:The four children take turns choosing a word.

So the total of the four stringers plus the extra player = the four stringers plus two stringers + one stringer + the third stringer.

{"text": "D: D: D\nYou could ask: Why would you not have contraceptives if you are a woman? The answer is not the same if you are not a woman, because contraceptives can be used for women also.\nThe cost of contraceptives for men is relatively expensive. Men and women are different as well because of their different sizes and shapes. The cost is based on the volume of an orgasmic period. An orgasmic period is the time where a man or woman feels the most intense sexual pleasure. Men usually have between 7 and 34.5 minutes, while women usually have between 11 and 41.\nYou can get a male birth control pill for about $20 at pharmacies. Your doctor will also prescribe the pills for men if your doctor or midwife is a woman. The price varies from drug to drug and brand to brand.\nIf you are a non-woman, you can buy a sterilization or a vasectomy for around the same price. You can also get a tubal ligation for around $150 and an IUD for only $10. However, most of these options are only available to women or to young girls.\nMen should take a look at the price of contraceptives and take some action to reduce the price. If you can't get affordable contraceptives, it is best not to get an orgasm in the future or use other methods.\n\nInput:Where did the money to build up the construction industry come from? Choices: Government of course!\nOutput: Government of course! Yes the money to build up our country came from a government.\nIf it comes from the government of course it is a government. That is the reason why we have a government.\nBut government has to raise the funds. The government needs to borrow the money from some countries so that we can build. It does this by giving us more borrowing rights in the countries from which they borrow to build.\nThere are many countries that have the same interest in building a country. They borrow money and give it to us so that we can build our city. The cost of borrowing money is high and this is the reason why we can't borrow money and build all the cities in the country at the same time. The cost of borrowing the money is around 10-15,000% so it is really expensive to use our money to build because we will end up losing money. The only way the money to build will be spent is if we decide for it.\n\nInput: What is the minimum wage of a person", "answer": "A: health center"}

Only one person has to purchase a $200 insurance deductible while another must pay a $500 one-time payment. How much does each person have to pay in total?\nOutput: Start out by finding the total.\nSince only one person is buying insurance, that person only has to pay $200 = <<$200.01-.02> > $200 in deductible to cover their share of the costs.\nSince two people are paying the $500 the total is $1200 \u2013 $200 = <<$1200-500=1000>>1000 remaining.\nSo the total amount that each person had to pay (1200 \u2013 $200) or $1000 \u2013 $0 (= $500) were $1000 less than $1200 (2 - $200) or $1200 - $0 = $1000 fewer than $1200 (1 - $200).\n\ninput: Richard\u2019s mother wants to sell the house she inherited years ago.

The device was named \"walk\" due to the fact that the invention created the ability to walk backwards forever.  What do you think Jerry's job was?\nOutput: As I mentioned previously, Jerry was an inventor. He invented the device. The device had two wheels and a handle. There was also a bell to tell you when you were walking backward.  The device was a success because people believed the device would never be broken. Therefore, no one wanted to put a stop to it.  So the device was never used, but people still thought they had made it.  Then, one day, Jerry was asked what the device was really used for. He responded that it was only really used for backwards people to look around at themselves. When he asked why, he was told that they didn\u2019t like to look up.  Since no one wanted to stop the invention, the inventor had no choice but to continue.  Eventually, the inventor realized that his invention wasn\u2019t good to start with and stopped. What was his job after that?\nOutput: It's difficult to say if Jerry was ever a successful inventor. He might have been a more reliable inventor than he had ever shown before.

Each individual teacher needed to show that he was paid.\nOutput: $1000 teachers = $1000 divided by 6 teachers = $200 each\n$200 per class = $1000 divided by 3 = $800\nSo each teacher would have $800 left at end of the year, $200 for the remainder. It is the students who would pay it, $200 each, $800 to teachers, and $200 to each teacher. So the final answer is $800\n\nInput: The car is not the right vehicle for the job the teacher is hiring the students to do. They should get a bicycle.

There is no right or wrong. It is between $400 and $410. The way I worked out it I took the total from this question and divided by two and the total from this question divided by two and the net amount was $410. So, the answer is 410 divided by two divided by 4 divided by 7 (4 people) divided by 15 (15 people) so the answer is 410 divided into $4 divided by 2. The answer, \"40,\" corresponds to a net of $4 divided by 15 divided by 4 divided by 35 divided by 45 divided by 55 divided by 75. So, the answer number is 425 divided by 4 divided by 15 divided by 35 divided by 35 divided by 15 = 425 divided by 4 divided into $395. You got 425 divided by 4 divided the net amount.

If Congress passes a long-term savings program, it will cost approximately $1 million, and he expects to save $1 million. He plans to take home $600,000 as his salary. If there is no long-term savings program and there is no cost reduction or benefit program, the savings will be $600,000. Therefore, the federal government must fund these programs and will take in $600,000 each year. The president must pay taxes on the $600,000, but his total income could be $800,000 for one year.

The book ends with a wedding. But the main problem is that the baby has to stay in the womb for 9 months. A little boy decides to help out. So he decided to leave the house early, so his mother would not have to stay at home all day. The baby decided to stay up late and sleep the night before. Then, he called his mother on the way home from work and said, \"I\u2019ll walk you to your car.\" The mother thought that the baby was too young to walk and he was going to go and tell someone to take him to school, so she told him that he should come home instead. So the baby called home from school and left and walked about a mile by himself and got home just in time for his mother to start working. The girl is a little scared of her baby but thinks it\u2019s funny, so she lets him stay home while she shops. After shopping the baby came back and walked with his mother. After the baby was old enough to walk, he asked if he could stop shopping.\n\nOutput: The baby has to stay in front of the car; he has to listen and keep an eye on his mother, who is a little worried, because there has been only 1 baby so far.

So the baby has to stay home until his mother has been pregnant for a week; since his mother had been working every day, only 2 days have passed since she got home. The baby can stay in front of the house with his mother for about 2 1/2 hours more; if he has a bad day, the mother can put him in the house so that he doesn\u2019t get to know his neighbors too well. As his mother is leaving to go to work, he comes with her to use the phone.\n\nInput:A movie takes place on a boat; this movie features Jack Nicholson and Julia Roberts, who are in love with each other.

How much will you earn from the car wash?\nOutput:You get $200.00 if you use your own car wash kit.\nYou get $50.00 if you use the car wash from a repair shop.\nYou get $15.00 if you use a car washer that is installed at a car wash.\nThe car wash cost $1700.\nStart by figuring out how much you think you will earn from the car wash and subtract that from the total cost. The total amount left is $1699. If you divide that by (1699 * 100 = 1290), then you will get ($1699 / 1290) = $10.67. That total value will be the money you will earn from the vehicle wash.\nFrom there, divide that amount by $34.17 (the difference between a car wash and repair shop value) and you will get the money you will pay for the car wash. So the final answer to the car wash question is $10 + $34.17 = $5.25\n\nInput:What amount of cash is needed to buy a car? The answer is $100.

{"text": "This is a long answer and you might need more time. I will break up the long answer into 7-10 smaller sections.\nQuestion authority is important to remember because when people travel on liquids (as in, on liquid), one can find the most answers quickly. In fact, the best place to look for an answer is at the front of the boat, where you would expect to see the name of the boat.\nHigh fives are important to remember. However, I will explain this as a fact instead of a question so you can decide the answer when thinking about it.\nThe most expensive item in the world is a watch. A watch is something people buy as \"something nice to have.\" A watch contains the hands and the time indicator. A watch that does not have a movement will last a lifetime. As time runs out and the clock stops, a watch becomes worthless.\nThe most dangerous time is when you are traveling long distances. When a person is traveling an hour and a half, the time change in the location and therefore the time that you are in is a great source of danger.\nTo find and answer a question, a person needs to ask a series of questions in their minds. For example, instead of asking how long it is until the sun rises today, a person should ask how long it is until a watch will run out of batteries. Another question that may be useful to ask is, \"If the sun shines on the watch at 7 in the morning, how long will it last until it starts to run out of batteries?\" A person's answer to this question determines how long the watch will last and their budget is affected by it.\nLearn from the other 5.

The new owner had an opportunity to purchase a successful competitor. The new owner would borrow $100,000 from his parents and invest the rest of the savings in the competitor. He also planned to buy the competitor's property. The total cost of the new competitor purchase would be $10,000,000. What would be the interest rate on the loan?\nOutput: The new owner would borrow 25% of the $10,000,00 at 3.33% interest per year.\nSo the final interest rate on the loan would equal $5000,000/3.33 = $1000,000.\nSo the final loan payment is $5000 on the $10,000.00\n\nInput: You are going to get out of a three hour traffic jam when the car is stopped in front of you.

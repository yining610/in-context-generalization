{"text": "If it's in a boutique, you need to find out if there are any hidden chokers and if they are not in the jewelry box.  You must also determine if all jewelry is for sale or if it is just the one item.  If everything in the boutique is for sale, you have to go further back to find the hidden choker.\nIf all the jewelry is just the one item, you can determine where to find other jewelry and even the hidden choker.  If everything in a jewelry store is for sale and there are items in the store that are not necessarily for sale, you must locate the hidden items with your own search.  You must make sure that you know the sizes of necklaces, earrings, bracelets from other stores as well as where to find the hidden piece.\nIf the hidden item is not in a shop, you must go directly to shop to search for other items. If the hidden item is not listed in the mall's newspaper, you must find the hidden item by yourself.  Since you don't know the sizes of jewelry or jewelry pieces, you must follow the mall's guidelines.  If everything in all stores is a single item, you must locate the single item by yourself.  If it's in stores that are different brands and styles, your search will differ.  However, if everything in a mall is the same, the search is similar.\nIf you go directly to the jewelry shop from the mall, the necklace you are looking for is likely sold out.  You need to ask the jewelry shop personnel or go to the jewelry store itself if it has new jewelry on display.  Since all stores sell the same items, the search becomes straightforward.  If you go directly to a jewelry store's website, the website is likely out of date.  Therefore, you must go to their physical location.  It's important to go to the jewelry shop to locate the hidden jewelry.  So which of the following would you do: Use the mall's directory to find the shop address or ask a clerk to find it?\nOutput: Ask the jewelry shop personnel to find out the exact address\nIf you can't find the information via mall directory, you must approach a jewelry clerk or manager to ask the address of a jewelry store.\n\nInput: For every hour in April 2009, the temperature rose from 70 to 80 degrees.

Some said nature has been lost to man.\nSuppose a storm comes and the rain fails.  Would nature regain it's natural elements?\nOutput: If nature must have rain, nature had better have a good reason to have it.  So the storm could not be a natural event.  The storm, however, can be a consequence of natural occurrences such as drought or flood. Therefore nature had better have a reason to need rain.  So the next rain would be a natural one.\nSuppose a blizzard comes.  Would nature regain its natural elements?\nOutput:: If the storm would be accompanied by a blizzard, no rain is necessary.\nSuppose a snowstorm comes.  Would nature restore its natural elements.\nOutput: Of course not.  Nature's natural elements will always be missing.  Therefore nature always needs a reason to need them.

Over the course oof the next 5 hours, it rained 3 inches.  As the rain continues, it appears that the total amount of precipitation will increase.  How much total precipitation is there over the next ten hours?\nOutput:If the amount of total precipitation is 4+4, there is more than one level in the city.\nIf the amount of total rainfall is less than 4, there is not more than one level in any city.\nThe total amount of rain over the next 30 hours is 4/30 / 2=<<4/30/2=10>>10 inches.  So the total amount of rain over 30 hours will be 10+10+4=<<10+10+4=25>>40 inches.  Since the total amount of rain for ten hours is 2, the total rainfall for the whole period will be 30/10=<<10/10=40>>40 inches.\nThis is the result of using the method of total accumulation. The method of total accumulation assumes that the total amount of rainfall is always 4\nSo the final answer, 40/10=<<40/10=36>>36 inches total.\n\nInput: Ten different people took turns drawing the same picture using a stylus.

In June, it\u2019s equal to the total number available for use and in July it\u2019s equal half way between June and July. What is the reason for making this assumption?\nOutput: bees store pollen in comb and nectar in honey.\nIf the bees are able to store all of the pollen and nectar in their hive, they need a new hive before the honey they are storing runs out.\nIf enough pollen or nectar is stored in a hive, the amount of pollen or nectar from the same type of plant will not change.\nSo it\u2019s not the same amount of pollen or nectar from different types of plants.\nSo the formula used to estimate the number of bees per hive is for the following reason: if only the bees working at the hive at the time of the pollination count the pollinators they need, then only half the bees are in the hive and half the bees are out in the same area. In other words, when calculating the number of pollinators in a hive, the figure in each column is the same. If they aren\u2019t, then the number of bees counted at the hive is different. So in the calculation, the number of bees in each column does not even need to include bees in a new hive. Bees in a new hive need to be compared to the number of bees working on a hive at the time the pollination took place.\nSo there are two ways: take the number of bees in a new hive at the time the pollen or nectar was used in the calculation of the number of bees in the hive, or count the pollen and/or nectar as the number of bees in that hive at the time of a pollination.\nThe answer would be to count the pollen or nectar on the same plants as before, but then count them as bees working on the hive at the time the flower pollen was being used. Since the pollen was available to work with at the time of the pollen being used, no need to count it as bees in the hive.

Four people in their household drive their own cars on the first day of school. If one car is left unused for a day, how much money did each person spent for gas.\nOutput: If one car is left unused for a day, it costs both people $2.44, so each person will need to drive their own car.\nIf there is no car left unused, the total will be $1.36, not including the gas used.\nSo each person must drive his own car, saving only $1.36.\nSo $1.36 divided by 2 = $1.36\nSince the 4 people only had a car to drive, $1.36 divided 8 = $6.00\nSo the total savings for each person is $6.00\n\nInput: A person buys a used car which is five years old.

How many fish did he catch in the next hour by only catching two fish?\nOutput: The total time it took Tom to catch 4 fish on February 5 was 12 minutes and it took him 12 minutes to catch 4 fish on March 1 using his lure.  Therefore it took him 6 minutes to catch 4 fish using a lure after February 5.\nSo the total time it took him to catch 4 fish with his lure in February was 6 minutes.\nThe total time it took him on March 1 was 8 minutes.\nSince the total time it took Tom after February 5 was 15 minutes to catch 4 fish with four different techniques, Tom was only able to catch 3 fish on the first day of March using only his lure.\nTherefore, the second day of March was only able to catch 2 fish.  The result is total fish catch on March 1 was 3.\nThe total time Tom was able to catch four fish using only his lure on March 5 was 10 minutes.\nSince his technique was to use a lure and to catch only three fish, the total time took him 10 minutes to catch 4 fish\n\nInput: What is the length of the shortest and longest distance you have ever walked in the last month?

How many seconds is the temperature difference at 8:33 am? The correct answer is 1 second\nOutput: At 8:33, the temperature difference on the East (right) was equal to 1*32 = <<1*32=2>>2 seconds.  While the temperature difference on the West (left) was equal to 8+32 >><8+32>>2 seconds.\nSince the Earth's mean temperature is about 0.7\u00b0F warmer than the mean temperature during the summer, the differences in temperature measured during the same period make up the largest percentage increase in the Earth's average temperature.  If you double the amount of sun that rises on the East, you get a half a degree more global warming than if you double the amount of sunlight that rises on the West.\nTherefore, since the summer is warmer and because the Earth's mean temperature increases by 2*32*8 = <<2*32*3 = 52>>52 degrees, the Earth's mean temperature increase during the summer is 51*52+8=56 degreeF.\nSince the Earth is an arctic ice cap, warming from the sun is more powerful than warming from increased greenhouse gases.\nSo the final conclusion is that by doubling the amount of sun, the Earth's average temperature increases in the summer by an additional 2*52 + 8 = 56 degreeF\nSo the final concluded answered is 56.", "answer": "E: car"}

She didn't want her parents to think that it was her birthday.  However, in fear of her parents getting suspicious, she wrote a birthday greeting card with \"Happy Birthday Mom\".  Jane had a very difficult time dealing with the truth.  She wrote a follow-up birthday greeting card with \"I love you parents!\"\nWhy was Jane's birthday card for her parents so much better than her birthday greeting card for her Dad?\nAnswer: The most important thing that happened that day was that Jane saw a beautiful butterfly.\nThe butterfly was more important than the birthday card. The birthday card was a card that Jane wanted her parents to know that she loved them. The birthday card was just another thing that the parents received.\nThe birthday card was better than the birthday greeting card because it was written in her mom's handwriting.\nThe birthday card for her parents was better than the card for Jane because it was written in Jane's handwriting.\nThe last thing Jane was nervous about was being a birthday card for her family.

How much walking would she need to do over those three days to burn the calories she used each day during her job? (She uses 1000 calories per day.)\nOutput: In other word, the woman would burn more calories walking 50 miles than she did by eating 2,000 calories each day from her job.\nIf she walked 4 miles every day for 3 days, it would cost her 2,000 calories on Monday and Wednesday, and 10,000 calories the rest of the week.\nSo on Monday, if she walked 4 miles she would burn the calories she used during her job, and over the two days she burned a little less than what she burned over the weekend.\nIn other words she would burn 760 calories over the three days, less than she would have burned walking 50 miles by herself.\nBut, for the final 2 miles she would burn about 1,100 calories. (Assuming no exercise, such as running, yoga, dance, or walking.)\nSo Sunday's walking would be the best way to get 1,100 calories burned. (She burns 1000 calories from walking her job.)\nShe burns 1000 calories a day at her job, so she can burn only 250 calories on Sunday's walking.\nSo the final walk Sunday would be 250 calories burned, while Wednesday and Friday would be only 150 calories burned.\nShe would burn 750 calories over the two days walking, and 2,100 calories over the three days.\nSo if she walked 5 miles on each of Sunday and Monday, she would burn 1,950 calories in those two days!\nIn other words Monday's walking was the way to burn 1,950 calories, while Sunday's walking would be best for Tuesday's walking.\nBut since Sunday's walking would burn 250 calories less than Monday's walking, the final walk Sunday would burn 250 calories less.\nSo on Tuesday she would have only 75 calories more to burn than she does on Monday.\nAnd since she plans to walk 5 miles a day over the course of two days, that means she would need to walk 100 meters per mile less Sunday than Tuesday.\nAnd since she walks 2 km per day for her job, she will definitely need to walk more than 100 meters per day to keep", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

Since 200 kids start in middle school when they are 14 and there is no way that she could produce 800 kids, she needs to know how old each of those kids is.

Your response is that when hospitals expand they are choosing to include cardiac surgeons so that they can complete the job of a surgeon.  So you are right.\nIt is important to have cardiac surgeons on hand for gunshot wounds.  I am always ready to perform cardiac surgery on gunshot wounds. Sometimes things go wrong though, but other times we know how to go about it.  I don't have the same problem in the surgical department.  Every time we perform surgery here, the heart is not always beating. Sometimes we get it going, but sometimes the heart stops. If it stopped I have no experience handling the heart, but I assume they will be trained in something to revive it.  I can usually figure out what is going", "answer": "E: larger house"}

Suppose he gets the report two weeks after making the report.  Suppose he spends the next two weeks calculating taxes, and at a later date completes the calculations and files the report.  Which two weeks will be more productive?\nOutput: The only two days of the year when productivity is high are March and June.  Thus January's productivity does not matter as much as the other days.  Therefore, since March is more productive than June that means March is more productive than January.\nSince January is 3.5*2.5=<<3.5/2.5=9>>9 days, January's productivity is 3.6*2.5/9 =<<3.4/2.4 = 7>>7 days.\nThe next day, February, is 2.4*2.4/2.9 = <<2.3/2.9 = 7>>7 days, thus February's productivity is 2.1*2.1/2.9 =<<2.0/2.0 = 18.>>18 days.\nThe result of the above calculation is that February's productivity will be 2.4*2*2.9/2.9 = 5.3 <<3.0>3 days.\nThe following day, March, is 4.0*2.9/4.0 = <<4.0*2.4>4 days, thus March's productivity is 4.2*2.2/4.0 = 9.1 <<3.9>3 days.\nThus March's productivity is 9.1 * 2.4 = 4.9 <<3.9>4 days.\nThe difference in productivity between the last 2 days of the month will be ~4-9.1 = <<4\u22489\u22486>>6 days, so March's productivity is 4\u224816>>16 days.\nThus the final answer is 4", "answer": "A: train station"}

How much extra income will Christian make over the 24 days?\nOutput: Let\u2019s say 1 lbs. of popcorn cost $1 per day before taxes. Let\u2019s say it cost $1 per pound after taxes. Thus when the days are counted again we have that 1 +0.96 = 1.17. Thus we need to subtract 7.66 because of taxes. Thus we should subtract 7.66 * 1.17 = 8.67. Thus we are now looking at an extra 2.66 * 2.66 + 8.67 = 17.\nTotal income in the next 7 days: $17.16\nTotal income before taxes: $16.65\nThus we should subtract 11.33* 11.33 + 11.33 * 5% = 23.83. Thus we will be adding 16.33 * 16.33 + 1.83 = 19.82\nThus we are looking at an extra 22.83* 9.82 + 16.83 * 4% = 46.08\nThus we get $18.19 * 1.92 + 48.08 * 5% = $23.19 * 2.09 = $22.09\n\nInput: Jane is a teacher.

The ones with yellow birthmarks find 1-2 and the children with green eyes find 10-12.  So the doctor looks up 12 - 7 = <<12 - 7=15>>15 in the second dictionary.  But the doctor can only find 9-12-14 in the first dictionary. So the doctor gives two questions and then gives a single answer for both questions.\n>Which two children look up yellow birthmarks?\nWhich two children look up green eyes?\nWhich two children find 10-12?\nSo the doctor answers the first question: Which two children use a dictionary?\n>Which two children find 10 - 12?\nWhich two children use <>?\n>Which two men are 3-3 or 5-6?\nThe children are wrong about 3, 4, and 5, the doctor gets the correct names and gets 12 of them wrong.\nSo the doctor answers 10 - 12 - 14.\n>Which two men and women are 5-6?\n>Which two birds are 1-1 or 2-1?\n>What two different birds are 5-6?", "answer": "D: seed crops"}

When the weather condition is clear, how many hot dogs can you eat in one hour?\nOutput: Each hot dog counts 5*31=<<31*31=40>>40 hot dogs.\nWhen the weather is clear, there is an average of 40 hot dogs consumed during one hour. Average, this means it would only take 1 hour to consume 40 hot dogs.\nAssuming each hot dog only accounts 5*31 = 5*2=<<5*2=20>>20 hot dogs are consumed in an hour.\nOn a clear day, each hot dog consumes 20*2 = 70*20 = 270 hotdogs.\nSo it takes 3 hours to consume 270*2 = 960 hotdogs.\nThereafter, it takes 27 hours to consume 960*2 = 960 * 6 = 1080 hotdogs.\nSo in 27 hours, it takes 270*6 = 1080 * 6 = 960 hotdogs. On average, one hot dog is consumed approximately every 7 minutes.\nOn a clear sky, an average of 60 hot dogs are eaten each day.\nIf there are 2,000 hot dogs (that is one hotdog each for each month), 1,280 * 3 = 320 hotdogs total.\nOn a clear weekday, an average of 300 hotdogs are consumed per day.\nIf there is a drought in June, the water shortage may cause the government to ration hot dogs. So, in June the rationing may cause a shortage and more hotdogs may be consumed.\nThere will be less hotdogs than necessary, because of the shortage.\nSo in June, an average of 300*3 = 540 hotdogs are consumed daily.\nSo on average, 654*3 = 560 hotdogs are consumed daily, on a clear day.\nThe average number of hotdogs consumed per day is therefore 654 * 3 = 960 hotdogs. So a clear day consumes 654*3 = 960 hotdogs per day.\nOn a clear night, an average of 584*3 = 520 hotdogs are consumed each day.\nOn a Friday, an average of 485*3 = 285 hotdogs are consumed each night\nOn a clear day with less than average temperatures", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

The second question, whether he will be able to drive again, is highly unlikely.  We think it is the third question, but the first question is so high that it causes him to faint.  So the answer is unlikely that the man will drive again. In addition, we think he may not be able to see any longer, even with glasses. His risk of losing one of his eyes is less than 1% because it will not be damaged by the falling tree, and he will not be able to see his blind friend.  However, it is unlikely that his friend will survive without brain damage, so the answer is likely that the friend will sustain less brain damage.  We think the risk is so", "answer": "A: utah"}

The total discount due to pay off the loan is 80 percent.\nSince interest rates are decreasing, the entire discount on the mortgage is 20% less than what the president paid for an interest rate discount.\nTherefore, the total discount paid is 80% less than what the mortgage cost the president.\nTherefore, with an 80% discount, the total discount on the mortgage is 40% less than what would have been paid for 20% discount\nTherefore the total discount paid is 40 % less than what the mortgage would have cost a week earlier.

When 21 minutes have passed without sunlight, the last part of the house becomes dark.\nThus, I will have 24 minutes of sunlight.\nWhen 21 minutes of sunlight has passed without sunlight, the sun's position in the sky will have remained the same as 7:30 a.m. on Sunday, so the time it takes for the house to be completely dark is now 10 a.m. on Monday.\nThus, by 10 p.m., the sun has risen again and will remain in the west for about another hour before it will once again be somewhere in the east, and will remain there for 5 hours before it returns to the west.\nThus, it has taken me 24 hours to darken 8 of my house's 10 walls by noon on Monday.\nMy sunrise time is 9 a.m.\nTherefore, the total darkness will occur 21 minutes after sunrise at 10:30 a.m., and the light will now again appear 12 minutes after sunrise at around 10 p.m.\nThus, my house will be dark within 17 minutes after sunrise on Monday.\nThe sun will not reappear, or the sun will reappear somewhere else in the east, or in some other direction until around midnight.\nThus, my sundown time is 11:30.\nSince the sun is present at noon, my sundown time after sunrise is at 6:30.\nThus, my sunset time, after sunrise tomorrow is at 9", "answer": "D: front porch"}

On the first round, the players were divided into four groups of 20.  The first game, each player had 4 minutes to win the first game.  If the player did win, they moved onto the second round in a separate group.  At the end of four games in each group, the player who had lost the first game had not earned enough points, so they had to play the second game again.  If they lost the second game, they were eliminated from the tournament.\n  Each day, one team was eliminated from the tournament. Every day, 20 teams qualified for the next day of the tournament. From each team, a team captain picked which team members went into their group.  At the beginning of each match, the team captain announced all members in the group. There was no limit on how many members were in a particular group. For example, if there were 20 players and 4 positions, there were 40 individuals in a group.   Once each group had the number of players it needed, the playing began.  Players moved around the playing area, trying to get their friends to stand still to make up for the time they spent in their groups.

Players had 2 minutes to win each game, and the team with the highest aggregate score came out on top.\n  The tournament was held every day from Tuesday through Saturday. During the tournament, each coach rotated their teams for new team members to participate.  There was no one team that dominated the other teams during the tournament, since each team had at least 3 different players.  If a player lost his game, the game was immediately repeated, and whoever won the second game was the winner.

The total number of people you can hear as a group then is 50*5=150 people\nTherefore, this is 150 + 10 = 170\nSo the final answer for the example is 170 - 10 = 170\n\ninput: When you eat chocolate, most of it will go down a pipe instead of all of it going directly on the tray.\nOutput: In order to determine the quantity of chocolate that goes down the pipe, you will need to know the mass of the chocolate (how much the chocolate weighs) and the gravity (how much the chocolate's mass would add to the weight of the pipe). If the chocolate weighs 5 ounces and the mass of the pipe is 10 grams, then the pipe has 100 grams of chocolate in it.\nOutput: If the pipe had 100 grams of chocolate in, then the sum total of chocolate in the pipe (total weight) would be 400 grams, or 200 grams of chocolate per cm of pipe length.\nTherefore, the sum total of chocolate (total weight) in the pipe would be 400*100=200 grams per cm of pipe length, or 5.5 grams per cm.\nSo since the pipe length is 5.5 cm, the total weight of chocolate in the pipe would be 200*5=600 grams\nTherefore, the total weight of the chocolate in the pipe would total 600*5=1660 grams\nSo the total weight of chocolate that goes down a pipe is 1600 grams\nTherefore, the final answer for the previous question is 1600 grams\n\nInput: This equation (yields the ratio) will produce the amount of chocolate that will fall down a large, shallow bowl.\nOutput", "answer": "B: fall asleep"}
{"text": "The correct answer is A\n\nInput: After two years of marriage, Mary and Tom went on vacation together. Mary had to rent a minivan and drive 3 hours to travel with Tom.  What did Mary drive?\nOutput: Tom drove the minivan\nThis means Mary, on her own, drove 3x the distance she had to drive if she rented a van from one stop to the next.\nTherefore, in order to travel from point A to point B, the distance would be A+T = A+T+T+.  Therefore total travel distance is 3x=A+T.  Therefore total travel time from point A to point A, is 3x=A-T-.  Therefore total travel time to another point, if Tom had not driven, is 3x=T-T.  Therefore total time that travel could have been completed during the three hours that Mary drove, is 3x=3*A=A+T*.\nTherefore the travel time from point A\n\nInput:The year 1894:  William W.

{"text": "You can send something very fast in a fast and inexpensive way by using the airplane and ship's hold method using either a propeller or a propeller/hull.  The airplane should be capable of carrying 8 times the payload as a ship's hold, but shipping times on ships vs. planes can vary with weather conditions and local customs.  The ship's hold would have to have space for a cargo container.\nThe fastest ship, called the Flying Express, can be made in a matter of minutes and can carry approximately 500 tons of cargo with 4 people.  This ship and cargo container will be traveling from one part of the world to another, so it can be used to haul many different kinds of cargo.\nThere are many methods available in ship's-hold cargo transport, so you do not necessarily have to use plane or ship's-hold.  The first and most obvious way to load up a cargo trucking container with cargo is to carry it by the wheels, using the ship's hold cargo container as a makeshift shipping container.  This way of loading the container is more or less like sending money by email, with the container's contents being sent back to the customer by the truck.\nThe second best way to ship goods is to use a container car. The most famous car, the Biscayne, can transport over 500 pieces of cargo with minimal human effort.  The cost for this car is about $600,000.  It would take many such cars a day to carry a load of 8 bags of flour from California to New York, but it is possible.  Each day for the same weight of load would mean that they would need only one Car for the eight bags if their shipment is to make the trip around the clock for each bag.  Each day to the last would be 4 hours of driving, or 3 days and 4 nights of driving for the same amount of time.\nShipping by train is still more likely, as it takes one and possibly two days to deliver a parcel. Using a train as a shipping vessel is the most expensive, although for larger shipments, a ship is still possible.  It would be easier to use a Car if you already had a container ship.\nShipping a car by train is still more expensive than shipping it by ship.\n\nInput:  The weather office will report that a high of 60 can be reached in the afternoon, dropping to 30 degrees in the evening.

That means 15 of those drivers who do not want to haul freight will accept only $5.00 to +5.00 per day plus $5.00 for work on the days they do haul freight.

That means it is likely that 11 of those 17 drivers will accept $6.00; that means it is unlikely that only 7 drivers will accept $5.50 because there are none of their peers willing to pay $5.00. Therefore, there are at least 19 drivers who are not willing to accept the full freight rate. That means there are 21 drivers who refuse to accept the full freight and another 1 driver who wishes to be paid the full rate of the freight. Therefore, there are 25 drivers who are not willing and 10 drivers who desire to receive the full freight rate. Therefore, there are 30 drivers who will refuse to accept the full rate and 6 drivers who would prefer to receive the full freight. That means 22 drivers refuse to accept the full $5.00 to only 5 drivers who would prefer $5.00. So there are only 24 drivers who refuse to accept $5.00 and 15 drivers who would prefer $6.00. Therefore, 22 drivers refuse to accept $5,001.\nAssuming that 10 of those drivers will accept $5,000 and 8 drivers", "answer": "C: authentic"}

So the final answer is 50%\nIn this example, Peter has 50% of the expected chance that his daughter would successfully be born on Saturday, and Susan has the same expected chance as she did in the example.\nSo the final question is\nHow many percent is <50> in the final\nanswer?\n\nInput: On Tuesday at 10:30 PM, the phone rang, and Mr. Smith answered it.

{"text": "If this question were asked at a job interview, candidate one would be told \"Relax\" and candidate 2 would be told \"Have nightmares.\"  The correct answer would be A if job interviewer #1 is hiring.\n\nInput:  You have two identical children, 1 and 2.  2 earns more than you, but you would rather have your children rather than your money.  What is the best plan to increase the income of your children?\nOutput: If #1 earns more than $250 a month, it is a good idea to raise their minimum wage to $250 a month.  If #2 earns more than $50 a month, it's a bad idea to raise their minimum wages to $50 a month.\nSolution: Let's first work backwards.  Assuming that two children are worth $25 a month apiece, and they earn $100 a month apiece, they would be worth $125 a month.  If you increase their minimum wage to $125 a month, then they would be worth $150 a month.  Thus, you can increase their monthly earnings substantially by raising their minimum wage to $150 a month.\nThus, by raising their minimum wage from $25 a month to $150 for both children, they would earn more money.  And you only have to raise their wages by $25 a month.  Thus it is a good idea if they earn more than $250 a year but you would consider a minimum wage increase to better increase their earnings.", "answer": "D: restlessness"}

Which door is opened the most in the house on Tuesday?\nOutput: The door closest to the living room\nSo the final answer will always be D\n\nInput: There are seven days in an a week in the normal course of things.  The first day is Wednesday.  On Thursday, a new week begins.  On Friday, a new day begins.  On Saturday, a new day begins again.  Monday is the last day of the workweek.  On Thursday the next workweek begins.  The next workweek is Wednesday.  On Friday the next workweek begins again.  The workweek of the next week is Tuesday.  Then the workweek after that begins.  The workweek is just one of the seven days you will notice in a week.  This week is Tuesday.  Since the first day falls on Wednesday, the final answer will be B.  This is the way it works.\nThe next week becomes the workweek of Thursday.  The next work weeks becomes Monday.  The next work week becomes Friday.  The next work year becomes next week.  A work week is just one of the many ways you can see in a week.  There are other ways you can tell a workweek is starting and ending.  To begin the workweek of this week, for example, you need to start the following week on Monday, but since you will see the first day of the workweek of this month on Wednesday, you need to start Wednesday on Thursday.  To change the start date of one workweek, for example, you should change it to Tuesday in January, then Monday in February, then Monday again on March, then on April, then on May, then again on June, etc.  There is absolutely no reason why you should have to put any effort into changing the start date of a week.\nBy changing the start date of one week, you can alter all 7 of the work weeks of the day.  If you wanted to put your chair out the front door, for example, you could open the door and then close the door on Monday.  After that day, you do nothing but look out that door.  The next two weeks become Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and so on.  If you really wanted to sit out the workweek of next week, therefore", "answer": "B: office"}

If a person chooses the \"right\" answer, it often proves correct and useful.  If a person chose the \"wrong\" answer, not only may it not be correct, but it may also prove to be harmful.\nBecause in either case, the \"wrong\" answer is usually wrong.\nSo it is better, and indeed better for a person to always choose the \"right\" option.\nSo it is important for a person in a situation where two answers exist to choose the most important \"right\" answer.\nSo to answer the question, when a person enters a circumstance where two answers are \"right\" and a person chooses the \"wrong\" answer without having any actual knowledge of which \"right\" answer is the most important, there must be at least 2 possibilities for the \"right\" answer:\n1. There is a circumstance where the \"right\" answer is one that is incorrect.\n2. There is a circumstance in which the \"right\" answer only can be shown to be incorrect from the perspective of the \"wrong\" answer.\nWhen a person \"chooses\" the \"wrong\" answer they often do so without any actual knowledge of whether or not \"the right\" answer is correct.  In such situations, the \"wrong\" choice is often the better choice, and indeed may prove to be the correct choice.\nIn such cases the correct answer is the \"right\" option -- that is, if any other option exists for the \"right\" option, the \"wrong\" option is the \"right\" answer chosen.\nTherefore what a person \"should\" \"choose\" is \"the best\" answer.  If there is no other option possible for \"the right\" option, it is always a \"right\" answer.\n\n This means that for a person in a circumstance where two options exist where both \"the right\" choice and a \"wrong\" choice can exist, there must be at the very least 1 more \"right\" choice than a person can actually choose.

So, Christian is 60 = 2-40 = 10-20 = 10 = 20 years old.  Since he is 2-20-10 = 20-8 = 32, he is 1-40-8 = 50-8 = 50-2 = 32 years old\nSo, Christian will have reached the age of 60 before Christian is 20 years old\n\ninput:There were 10 million tourists visiting New York State this year.

(It is already the number)\noutput: Let x be the distance between the sun and the Earth.\noutput: Let x = x + (x*7/4)\nx = <<x + 7*4>>4\nSo let's make sure that x= <<x = 8>8\nThe sun is at the equator at 6:20 am. So it will only be in direct view for one second.\nOutput: The average length of sightline from the eye is 2 seconds. Since 2/2 = 2*2, so the sun will be in direct view for 2 seconds. This means that during that 2 second period the average length of sightline is 4.76 seconds.\nIf the average length of sight is 16.4 seconds, then 2 seconds is 4.68 seconds, and so forth until it gets to 16 seconds, in which case it is 8.8 seconds long.\nSo average length of sight = 6.28 seconds.  The average will therefore be 2.68*16 = 6.68*4.08=6.68 minutes.  So, the total length is 4,903.4472 seconds, which is 27,280,400 seconds.\nOutput: The sun shines on the top of a building every 3 minutes and 25 seconds. Let x = the length of the sun. So the sum is 2*x/3 = 2*x/3/3 = 16.85*2*3*2.5=2162.\nSo it is 462.6 hours (3 * 24*50=72 hours).  If we include rest or sleep as the time since 6:20 am, then the total is 2.52 hours.\nSince 3 hours is 365 days, then since 24 hours is 21 weeks, the total is 3.51 hours.\nSo the total is 1.51 hour = 5.56 hours.\nIt took 4 minutes 51 seconds to get this problem solved.  That time included rest, which had a length of 9 minutes 49 seconds, and sleep which had a length of 2 minutes", "answer": "B: office"}

He got the chance and he didn't take it.\nThe difference between both of them is that Christian has already seen what happens when he doesn't take a chance and Billy doesn't, but his mother doesn't know how to tell him how to be careful.\nSo what does this have to do with faith?  Christian didn't try hard enough to be safe in church because he was afraid that it would hurt him, while Billy's mother had to tell him all the reasons why being afraid of rides would hurt him.  Billy's mother had to make him aware of what it will do to him when he was afraid of rides, in order for Christian to consider taking a chance himself, but Christian's mother didn't have to tell Billy not to go to church because he was afraid of it hurting him.  Christian's mother didn't tell him to be scared of rides because he would be scared regardless of the results, while Billy's mother didn't tell Billy not to go the fairgrounds because he would feel the results of being scared of rides.\nThe difference between a mother and a man is that the woman who cares for her son can tell him that the results will hurt him, while the woman who cares for Billy doesn't have to say anything because he knows the results will hurt him.\nThe difference between religious people and nonreligious people is that the religious person will have no fear of hurting themselves,", "answer": "B: hall"}

How much was the actor paid?\nOutput: She made $1,100 - (50% less) = $500\nAn actor who plays in 500 plays makes $500 per play; the average actor gets $25 per play. An actor who plays in 50 plays makes $75 per play. An actor whose main role in a 50 play is a comedic sidekick makes $200 per play. So the average actor gets $2 per play while the sidekick gets $1.25 per play.\nFor a play, if 10 actors play and one gets fired, the other ten will not feel the full loss of the actor (1/10th of the cost of the ticket); if there are 5 new people playing instead, the replacement actor will receive at least $3 a pay. So the average actor will get $6 a play.\nTherefore, the average cost of an actor is $10 per play, while the average cost of an actress is $1 per play\nTherefore, the average pay to an actress is about 4 times the pay to the actor\nSo the average pay to an actor is $21 per play, while the pay to a costumed actress is about $24.\nTherefore, the pay to the costumed actress is $1 per costumed play while the average pay to an off-stage actress is $35 per play\nSo the pay to the costumbr actress is $12 per play while the average pay is $26.\nTherefore, the mean pay to an offstage actress is $23 per play\nSo the mean pay to the costumbrist actress is $28.75 per plays\nSo the average pay is $32.50 per play\nTherefore, an average costumed actress makes $35 per play\nso the average pay to this costumed actress is $64.84 per play\nSo she makes almost 70 times as much as an average costumed actress.\nTherefore, the paid time for an offstage actress is about 80:100:250 times the pay of an average paid actress.\n\nInput: One hundred pounds is 8 feet long.

How much time will Betty spend with John before she moves to another penpal?\nOutput: At 4 miles per day or 4 hours/day, John would write to Betty every 2 days, and Betty would write back to John every 2 hours and 20 minutes. So Betty would spend 4 hours/day with John, and John would spend 2 hours/day with Betty. So each day, John would write 4 books to Betty; Betty would write 8 books to John; and John would send 8 books to Betty. So this would take 2 hours/day plus the 2 hours spent in the restaurant. So each day, Betty would spend 4 days with John; John would spend 4 days with Betty; and each day, John would spend 4 books to Betty. So he would spend 4 books on Betty, and Betty would spend 8 books on John. So he would spend 16 books on Betty, and she would spend 4 books on John. So John would spend 16 books on her, and she would spend 8 books on him. Total time would be 16-16=<<16-16=48>>48 days, in other words, that is 48 days of reading for John, and 48 days of reading for Betty.\nSo John's total time with Betty would be 48 hours; Betty would spend 48 days with John; and Betty would spend 48 days on John.

Mrs. G. decided she needed to find new shoes.  Her sister wanted to use her old shoes, which were broken. How much did Mrs. G. pay for Mrs. G.'s new shoes?  Output: Mrs. G. spent $40.  Mrs. G.'s sister then spent $20 to buy her sister a new pair of shoes.  Mrs. G. gave 5 percent to Mrs. G.'s camping trip.\nOutput: Each time Mrs. G. spent money she gave 5% of her total to camp.\nSo the final equation is (Mrs. G. gives 5% of everything he buys) + ((Mrs. G. gives him a 5% discount when they go camping) + Mrs. G.'s % of the camp money.\n\nInput: Two cows each have 10 calves.

They have a budget of $3,000,000. How much money are they spending each week?\nOutput: Let w represent the total budget of $3, 000,000 in one year\nSince the budget is $ 3, 000,000 for 9 business days, it takes about 6 weeks to fill the budget.\nFor this year $ 3, 000, 000 will be paid out monthly\nSo the total amount of money will be $ 3, 000, million dollars\nWhich is 6 * 6/9 = $3, 000\nWhich is 9/9 = $3 000\nSo $ 2,999, 990 = $ $ 6, 099, 090 ($2, 989, 900*27) = $ $ 3, 099, 990\nTotal money =$ 6, 099, 9 90\nTherefore $ 6, 099, 090 = $ 6, 099. 090\n\nInput:  a.

How many people would be considered a team if they worked full time?   Answer:  A, 30, 75, 125\nSince the people at work represent half of the total people working, a team can consist of 25 people.\nSince the people on staff represent half of the people working, and a team represents a team, a team would have 10 people.\nTherefore the total number of people working is 10,000 - 25 = 10,000*8 = 50\nThe number of people who are 10% is 50% = 50*8 = 100\nTherefore total revenue is $7 000 + 100 = $ 17, 900\nAverage hour worked =25 = $ 7, 300 divided by 50 = 50\nThe number total hours is 50*10 = $ 11,250\nTotal revenue = $17, 900\nIf the hourly rate of pay was $ 7, 300 divided among 10 employees (5,500 + 100 * 25 = 10, 500), each employee would have been paid $ 25 per hour.

How much money does he have left?\nOutput: John has $1.0 billion dollars\nSince the same number of men and women were in his firm, John would have made 100 men and women working for him.\nSince the same number was in his law firm, that means that he would have made 500 men and women working for his firm in his 35-year career.\nSince the same amount of money was in his firm, he made 100 men and women who were working for him in his 35 years career.\nThus, he made a profit of $1.0 billion.\nSo $10.5 Million x 100 = $5.5 Million\nSo in his 35 years as a lawyer, the President's net profit amounted to $5.5 Million dollars.\n\nInput: If the average worker's salary is $5,000,000, for the same number of hours worked, how much have they made?\nOutput: If people's salary is $50000, they may have made 10 times that much for the same number of working hours.\nOutput: If people worked 10 times the amount with the same number of hours, they would still have made the same amount.\nSo their net income multiplied by 100 = $60000\nso $10.5 Million a year = 50*$60000\nSo the final answer was 30\n\nInput:  At a certain age, most men have to take time off from work.

This is why you use fingers to do simple chores such as picking apples, cutting grass, washing dishes, and opening packages.  Hands can serve as a powerful way to learn a new skill, making useful things with them, and even making gifts out of them.\n  Because a hand makes something of itself, it takes less energy to make something with a piece of wood or metal than to make something that is \"a part\" of something else.

The fire extinguisher is necessary for every place, so there are 128*5*2*2=512 fire extinguishers available for use. That means there are 512 available.

The number of houses in a square mile that are 4 feet apart is 2. The square footage of a house that is 5 feet apart, or 16 feet, is twice as big. So the number of houses in a foot area is twice as big as the one next door. Thus, a house in a foot area is five times the number of houses in the closest area. This means that one household has the size of a 2-unit house on a 1/10 as much acreage. Thus, a house that is 25 by 25 feet is more valuable than a 2-unit house twice as big. What about a 25x30 foot house? The number of square feet available in a 100 by 90 foot house (the size of 1,000 feet) is the same as the value of a 5x5 foot foot house. But here's the kicker. The houses that are 5 feet apart are bigger than the houses that are 4 feet apart.

Thus, many people would want a more secure way of traveling.\nYou can imagine how the choices would change when living without God and with god.\nMany people would opt for traveling by air whenever possible. They would opt for living without protection as well.\nThere are many ways to answer this question. However, the most general choice is that traveling either by car or helicopter is preferred.\nIt takes 11.53 years to travel from Paris to Los Angeles by car. If you live in California, it will be 12.52 years for you to travel by car there. If you live out of state, it will be an additional 20.13 years before you can reach LA by car. Since many people move to California and many people live outside of and outside of CALi, people who live in CALi will travel the longest. That is why a car is the preferred mode of travel in CALi. It takes 11.53 years for you to travel from Paris to New York. If you live in New York, you will be able to travel home in an additional 4.8 years. In an ideal world, most people would travel by car or helicopter when traveling.\nAt this point, the model may seem to be telling you to move to California since there are so many people there. But it does not tell you to drive from Paris to New York in 11.53 years. It also does not tell you how long it would take if you were to live in Paris instead of Cali or how long it would take to travel anywhere in an ideal world.

They each get a small bowl of food that has 5 croutons in it. They then trade the 5 croutons for 5 bowls of vegetables. How many bowls of vegetables would each of them have to eat to get to the full 15 bowls of veggies?\nOutput: It is 15 bowls, each with 5 croutons in each portion\nSo each food consists of 0.5 bowls of food = 0.5 x 0.5 = 1 bowl.\nSince each bowl is smaller than any of the other bowls, it means that each food should weigh less than a full bowl.\nTherefore each bowl is worth 1.5 times its food value = 1.5 x 1.5=2.5\nSo each food weighs 1.5 times its bowl weight = 1.5 x 2.5 = 2.75\nTherefore each bowl is 2.75 times its food value = 2.5x 2.75=3\nTherefore each food is twice its food value = 3\nSo each food is worth 4.5 times its food values.\nTherefore each food is worth 5 times its food values.

{"text": "A: A: car B: B: A: D: amusement park E\nSuppose there is a roller coaster near a park.  You choose B.  However, if you were to take the B car, you drive at a speed of 40 miles per hour, and then ride the coaster at a speed of 90 miles per hour.  How fast would you travel if you took the car B?\nOutput: Assuming the car B would last 1 mile, you would be travelling at an average speed of 100 miles per hour.  Because the coaster takes 45 minutes to complete its loop, the total time for you to cover the 2 miles would be 45 minutes.\nAssuming the roller coaster has an average number of cars, the total length of the ride would last 20 minutes.  Since it takes 45 minutes to complete an entire loop once, the total length of your 1 mile ride would be 25 minutes.\nIn theory if you were to take one of the car Ds (because it is at the faster speed), or the car Es, all three could be completed in the same amount of time.  In actuality, taking the car Ds would be faster since you would travel at the faster speed on your way to the coaster, but the 3 cars could travel at the same speed on your way home.\nIf you are to take one of the amusement park car E's, the total would be faster than if you were to take car D.  However, if it was during a peak season, it would take longer to cover the same distance.\nIf you took one of the urban area cars, all three would be completed sooner than if you took one of the amusement park cars.\n\nInput: It rains in the desert from Monday until Thursday.

Explain why.\nOutput: It is equal to 2, since it's divisible by 7 as well. By 2, 5 times 6 = 9. If 9 is divided by 7, it equals 8. If 8 times 6 = 13, it equals 12. If 7 times 6 = 29, it equals 24. If 7 times 10 = 42, it equals 41. Since 12.5 is divisible by 10, it equals 9. Since 19 is divisible by 19, it equals 19.

If the number of people who are below the poverty line is 10 billion, who is actually on some version of middle-class living?\nOutput: The number of people who are truly poor is less than 0.039% of the earth's population.\nSince there are 10 billion - 0.039% = 15 billion people, it is not a question of whether the number of people who make less than $300 a year is actually fewer than the population who make $300 or more. It is a question of whether the total number of people below the poverty line is 0.039% or 11 billion.\nSo the final percentage is only about 0.039%, or a fraction of 1%, which is much closer to living in poverty as middle-class than being poor in the world as an actual income class.\nSo the final number is 0.039\n\nInput: A man named John owns 11 red bananas.

They immediately stop talking and stare silently at each other while trying to figure out who waves at who.  Finally, they yell over to each other at the birthday girl's table, \"It's George.\"  George and Elizabeth stare at each other as their parents stare at them.  Finally, they look back at their parents. \"Elizabeth?\"  They look at each other then at each other again looking confused.  Finally, they both look at each other. \"George!\"  The man turns and waves at him.  George smiles back.  There is silence as the mother and sister stare at each other.  Elizabeth turns to the husband and says, \"I don't get what they're talking about.\"  The husband answers, with a nod like he knows what they are talkin'.\nAfter the husband and the wife have had enough time to figure out the meaning of what happened, they go outside and head home with their children still standing there pretending to be George and Elizabeth.\nWhy was the baby called George and Elizabeth? Because Elizabeth was surprised when the son told her before she got to meet him that he was her friend. The mother can tell that Elizabeth wasn't expecting that in so many words because he called her his friend before, before she heard him say he was her friend.

At 6 hours past noon, that same shadow stretches 6.1 feet. This is because 8 hours after noon, the shadow grows more than 4 feet in length, from 4.2 feet at 6 hours past noon to 6.1 feet at 8 hours past noon.\nSo the total shadows on those five days are 6.1*8*>4.2*6.1*4.2=<<6*4.2=27>>27 inches.\nSo the number of shadows from 8 hours past noon on those five days are 5 + 6*36+4.*6*3.5*36=37 * 6*26 + 4.2 = 57.5\nSo 57.5 * 8 = <<57.5>7.75\nSo 57.5*8 = <<57.5-7.75>>7.75 inches\nSo with the 7.75 inches per day, we get 57.6 inches for the five year period (8 years).

They will buy nothing except food and drink.  They could not have bought the food they will eat during the 2nd game had they spent any money at all.  D: they have a lot of money and they buy everything they can.  When the 2nd game starts, they will have even more money than they had planned.  How many people are in the room H and how much money will there be on the wager?  E: they didn't think of trying to win the game.\nSince H will not win, there will be no money on the wager.  So E will have zero money.\nSuppose B is right (no one in C's game is to play) and D is right (the people in C's game had more money on the wager), so the bet of B and C is right and the bet of D and H is right.  How will H guess which card came first?\nSince E played the second card, D must have played the third card, unless H has a third hand.  If not then H doesn't have a third hand and must guess by guessing which card came first.  This leaves two possibilities: (a) E and D played \"one\" hand and are correct about the right card being the 3rd card, and (b) H has a third hand and guesses the 3rd card which turned up second the first time.  If H guesses (b), then the person to get left holding the bag (D) must have the 3rd card.\nIn either theory (a) or (b), it must be the 1st or the 3rd card.  So if C plays this card, he is more likely to get a 3 instead of an 8.  If D plays this card, his chances of getting an 8 instead of a 7 decrease.  If E plays the 3rd card, E is less likely to be right than H, and the odds of him being right on the 1st and the 3rd card are even.", "answer": "C: count"}

{"text": "When the temperature decreases rapidly, it makes a continuous movement across the sky.\nOutput: When the sun changes rapidly, it can go either A or B, depending on what the sun\u2019s magnetic field is. If the sun\u2019s magnetism is increased, then it changes to A. If the sun\u2018s magnetism is decreased, then it changes to B-1.\nWhen temperature decreases rapidly, it will begin its movement across the sky at approximately the 1 hour mark.\nOutput: When a steady temperature increases rapidly, it has a very low probability of falling below the freezing point. This probability gets high when there is a gradual change in temperature.\nOutput: When temperature increases slowly and steadily, then the atmosphere keeps the temperature constant. Temperature fluctuations are called temperature ups and downs. Higher temperature ups and downs is called warming.\nWhen temperature increases slowly and steadily at the 1 hour mark, the sky has cooled and the temperature has risen. Temperature up and down is called cooling.\nOutput:When the coldness increases rapidly at the 1 hour mark the atmosphere creates a force to keep the temperature constant at 1 hour. This is called the negative pressure. Higher negative pressure is called the warming.\nWhen colder temperatures persist after 1 hour, then a warm-up starts to increase. This is called the warming. If there is more negative pressure than positive pressure, then warmth is created, and this is called the freezing point. If there is more positive pressure than negative pressure, then freezing is created, and this the called the thawing.\nThe temperature at 1 hour is 32.9 degrees Celsius\n8 degrees = 7*32=0.4 degree celsius The total amount of heat given from these 8 degrees is 32.9 * 0.4 x 0.4 = 32.9 celsius.\nSo the final average temperature during the time period is 32.9 celsius\n\nInput: Each day in New Zealand the temperature gets colder and colder with more clouds.

He saw a red car ahead of him. When he got closer to the rear of the vehicle, he saw a license plate that he recognized. He was driving 100 miles per hour (mph) less than the speed limit (mph). Christian called the police and reported the accident.  How fast was he driving when he reported the accident?\nOutput: Christian was driving 100 mph when he called the police.\nIn case you are not familiar with speed limits, the speed limit is the speed that the majority of the drivers of the road are going. In this instance, Christian is travelling 10% above the speed limit of the roadway. Since he reported the accident at 10 mph under the speed limit, Christian's speed when he called the police was 80 mph (mph). In this situation, Christian reported the accident at 80 mph because the maximum speed speed on the area road is 70 mph (mph). Since Christian only travelled 10 percent of the speed limit, his speed when he called the officer was 80 mph. In this situation, Christian's speed when the officer called the police was 80mph. Of course, this is just an illustration of a single speed trap. However, a good example is, you may see a cop driving at 70 mph and a couple of cars ahead of him going by at 80 mph. Therefore, he may need to increase his speed to 60 mph. In general, Christian's speed over 50 mph is much more important than this example, but in the case of this single case, it was more important to warn drivers of the speed trap than to go over the speed limit of the road.\nOutput: Christian reported the accident at 10 MPH under the speed limit.\nIn general, Christian's speed at 50 mph is much more significant than his speed at 80 mph.", "answer": "D: female"}

The chickens were kept on the concrete block for 4 days, because they were 1*4+7 = 1*4+7*4 = 8 chickens and the farmer had 4 chickens.\n2. A+B=C\nWe get B because we know that the farmer had 4 chickens (7*4+9)*4 = 10.  So we subtract 4 from 7, so the number of chickens on the concrete block is 10*4*9+4*4 = 10 chickens+4*0*4 + 4*0*4.  (1*4) + (4*8) = 10*4*9, which is 8 chickens\nSo to get a new record of 8 chickens, he had to take the chickens off the concrete.\n3. So there were 10 chickens, or 8 x 1=8 chickens in the field\n4. 1*8 + 4 = 8+4\nWe get 3 because we know that for 1*8 + 4, the chickens had 8 chickens.\n5. So we subtract 4 from 1*8 + 4 to get 7 chickens\n6. so we get 6 chickens which is the exact same number of chickens he had before, but less than he had before\n7. so for the total of 12 chickens, he had 10 x 1=8 chickens\n8. But for the chicken's last 4 days, he had none\nSo for 2*8 + 4 to 8 + 6, he had only 8\nThe chickens got lost.

{"text": "To determine which position is superior I must measure the number of advantage positions\nIf I only measure the number of advantage position in the leader versus the rest of the pack (as opposed to comparing the number of advantage positions in the top and bottom positions), I conclude that the only advantage (that would affect my position on this list) is determination.  If the leader and the rest of the pack all move for the advantage at the same time, then it does not increase my advantage.\nI measure all advantage positions from the top of the pack (first place) to the bottom of the pack (last place), and determine the advantage of each position.\nI compare the number of advantage positions each man has and I determine the average position for each man.\nBecause of this, I believe each man has a different advantage compared to the other men.\nFor example, if I am a second place man and the leader is a first place man (since we have the same number of advantage positions for each position), then I can go ahead of him and lead the pack in each individual advantage position.  Since each man moves for the advantage at the time of each maneuver, I can only lead the pack once each opportunity.  Thus the position of a second place man in the leaderboard will be different than a first place man's.\nMy second place position is therefore higher than a first place position because I get to move for each advantage I have and lead the pack if I so choose.\nBecause of this the total number of advantage positions is greater for a second place man than it is for a first place man.\nBut that only affects me because if I am trailing the pack because I do not move, then I will be on the second place position even if the leader is trailing me (he may be still better than me if we are behind the pack).  Since I have the advantage by moving for each advantage position, I am now on the first place position instead, and I get to be even higher.\nIf the pack were moving for the advantage in the same order, then the position of each man would be the same.  Each one of us would be in the leaderboard the same.\nSince the pack is moving for the advantage in order, my advantage positions are all different from the leaders' advantage positions.\nBecause of this all the advantage areas for each location are different on our board.  So the top and bottom positions will be different on the board even though we are all still on the same leader", "answer": "C: superior"}

No one wins at the end of the month, but each person keeps the ticket.  After a year, the tickets are sold together, and the people holding them split the money between themselves.  Who won the most tickets?\nOutput: The ticket holders must add up to 40 tickets, one for each ticket holder.\nSo each ticket holder needs to add 40^4 = 120 + (100 + 120) = 240 tickets, or 240 x 60 = 600 tickets at 4 dollar each.\nAnd each ticket holder needs to divide 120 x 60 = 240 = 180 tickets (120 * 5 = 120 = 240 = 180 tickets)\nSo if the final answer is 60, then that means 60 more people won tickets that would not otherwise win.\nSo the final answers are 60, 120, 120+180 = 60 tickets at 4 dollars each.\nWith the 120*6 = 240 tickets at 4 dollars each, 30 tickets total were won by the ticket holders at the end of each month.\nSo the total tickets won by the ticket holders was 60/720 = 20 tickets each month (20 + 5/720 = 20)\nSo the final answer was 20\n\nInput: A woman decides she could live on $30 per month.

How many \"What is your opinion?\" questions would be answered by each person?\nOutput: Four \"What is your opinion\" questions\nThey each get 2*2 = 6 \"What is your opinion opinions?\" questions.  The total of all 6 questions is 6-4 = <<6-4=20>>20.  Alice's answers, being 4-3 + 2*3 = 4-2 + 2*2 = 2-1 + 2*2 + 1*2 = 12*2.  John's responses, being 4-2 + 3*1 = 5-1 + 2*1 = 8-1.

When will Christian turn 15?\nOutput: Since Christian turns 15 in 16 years, Brian will turn 40 years old in 16 years.  Since Brian turns 40 in 16 years, he is currently 40+4 = <<40+4=56>>56 years old.  Since Christian turns 15 in 6 years, his age is 6-16 = <--160>>160 years old\nIf Christian turns 15 in exactly 6 years, he will be 158 * 6 = <<158+1=210>>210 years old.\nSince 6 years from now Brian turns 40 in 16 long years, his age would be 56+6 = <<56+6=66>>66 years old.  Since 60 years ago Brian turned 20 years old, he is already 66 plus 6 = <<60+6=98>>98 years old.\nSince Brian turns 40 in 16 very long years, his age is 98+1 = <<98+1=126>>126 years old.\nTherefore, Bob turns 50 years old in 8 years, Bob turns 60 years old in 12 years, and Bob turns 62 years old in 16 years; therefore, Bob is the oldest in his own family.\nSince we know what Bob's age is in 8 years, we know what his age in 12 years, and what his age in 16 years will be.\nThis makes the answer 8 years\n\nInput:At 1 pm Central Time on Tuesday, January 10th, what will be the temperature at the equator?\nOutput:\nIn a year, at 1 pm Central Time on January 10th, 2010, what will be the average monthly temperature?\nIf we divide a year by the number of months, and divide a month by the number of days, and divide a day by the number of minutes, we", "answer": "D: study"}

Christian is driving his little red car to work. He picks up two ladies. He takes one of them home and has the other drive him there. Both ladies will get out a few times and get back in Christian's red car. At one point, both ladies will get out of the car and Christian will get into his. At another point, both ladies will be getting back in his car and Christian will get out of the one car and get into the second car again. At another point, the first lady will go into the other car and Christian will get back into the one car. At another point, another lady will get out of the other car and Christian may get into the other car. Christian is stopped at a stop sign at this time.  He is in a yellow lane. Christian is in yellow B lane and the red car is in the left turn lane. The red car is pulling out at the stop sign and Christian may go in red A lane or continue on his way. If Christian goes in the red lane, the cars on the right, and red car on the left will both be stopped. If Christian pulls out in red, the cars on the left will also be stopped. Christian may be in yellow and red, or he may be in both, or he may be driving in yellow and red alone. If Christian is in yellow and red alone, the stop sign will stay on his side of the street. If Christian is in either yellow and red alone, at least one car must stop. Christian has not picked out an alternate route. Christian must decide which lane to go and where to go by himself.  If Christian drives in red, the cars in yellow will change lanes as they do at the next light. If Christian pulls out before yellow or red is over, he will get a ticket for not following the light. If Christian goes in yellow, the cars in red will not change lanes until after the stop.   So Christian needs to decide which lane best suits him.  Christian thinks maybe he should go in red A lane because the car on the left will probably be coming in yellow.  Christian thinks that he should go in red B because the drivers in red will probably be coming in blue as well if he pulls out quickly.  For his last choice", "answer": "D: doors and windows"}

Why is that, and how will you survive?\nOutput: What happens to your heart when your heart stops? Nothing. You can't tell it stops, or it could explode. You only know that it stops.\nWhen your heart stops, the oxygen in your bloodstream starts to flow. Your heart pumps blood, producing more blood. Your kidneys start working. When your kidneys work, they dilate the blood vessels, increasing the blood's volume.\nBlood pressure is the heart's measurement of pressure. Your heart pumps more blood to your brain and more blood to your muscles.\nIf something changes all of the time, there's no way that the blood can support your body's needs. Then the brain or muscle can't work properly. This leads to death.\nYou will live, in fact, for hours after your heart stops. It will just seem like hours to you.\nIn fact, your heart will keep pumping until a doctor shows up. Then your heart will stop again.\nWhy is your heart so important to your life?\nHow does your heart make the blood to make your brain work and your muscles work and your muscles do what they do?\nIf your heart stops, you will die.

{"text": "Exercising immediately leads to relaxation, which can lead to stronger muscles.\nSo exercising immediately leads to relaxation, but the gains don't last very long for muscles that are in good shape.  After exercising quickly, your muscles start to recover more quickly and strengthen.\nSo working out immediately makes you stronger, but it also takes away from the enjoyment of going for a walk, a ride in the car, or taking a nap.  Working out after eating something unhealthy leads to being more hungry and more tired, when you should have more energy.\nSo exercising quickly improves your muscle strength, endurance, and fitness, but it doesn't improve your energy output or your enjoyment of doing something.  Exercise on a regular basis can increase endurance, which can improve your fitness to an extent.  Overworking your muscles leads to fatigue, which is bad for fitness as it makes you sluggish and tired.  It is better to work out moderately, instead, as moderate exercise reduces your risk of getting injured.\nExercising early in the morning can lead to the right muscles feeling tired, which allows you to work out at a slower pace and is easier on recovery.\nExercising late in the afternoon can lead to sluggish muscles, which means you will not work out as efficiently as you could.  It is best to exercise at a steady pace, rather than an increase to a steady pace.\nExercising too frequently at high intensity has been shown to cause fatigue and muscle soreness.\nExercising for 20 minutes does not lead to significant muscle soreness or fatigue, and therefore it can lead to being tired, and not working as fast as you could. Working out at a steady pace, such as walking, running, or jogging, can improve your fitness.\nExercising moderately, such as walking up the stairs, can improve your health and your fitness, while exercising quickly can increase your fitness.

The customer tells John that he will pay him $2,000 a week to rent the car again for 5,000 weeks.  John tells him he is willing to invest $500,000 for him to rent the car for 5,000 weeks, so that he can buy just that car at a cost of $2,000.  Now John has a $5,000 investment, which means that he earns $600 per week on each car as a rental.\nEach customer brings a much more expensive car than the last, and the same with the cars coming in from the south.

If it is 30 minutes for the flight and it is at 6,000 feet at the top, how many minutes is the plane's top speed after the first mile and how far can the man travel?\nOutput: After the first mile, it can reach 6,000 feet altitude in 30 minutes and can fly 20 miles after the 50th mile.\nSo the final speed of the plane is 6*40 / 26 = 885 miles an hour.\nThe final speed after 50 miles is 885/40 = <<885^50=1453>>1453 miles per hour\nThus the final speed is 1453/40 = 15*85 = <<15*85=360>>360 miles per hour\nSince speed is directly proportional to distance, it is 10*35/30 = <<15*35/30=60>>60 miles per hour.\nThus the total distance achieved with a 30-minute flight is 60*105 = <<60*105=1553>>15", "answer": "C: new hampshire"}

In other words, if the rocket did have a 30-foot diameter, but you had nothing else but the size of the balloon to go by, it would still be the same diameter as the balloon.\nIf the rocket has a 30-foot diameter and a diameter of 30-feet, then that is also twice the diameter of the balloon.  In other words: if the rocket has twice the diameter of the ballon, then the diameter of the rocket is twice the diameter of the smaller balloon.\n\nInput:If the Earth, which weights 200 pounds, spins at a speed of 300 inches per second, then the Earth will accelerate to the speed of light in one and one", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

{"text": "310\nThe correct answer is.....B\n\n##Answer: B\n\nThe house had many things attractive about it:\n\n* It was in a lovely neighborhood\n* It had a large kitchen\n* It was surrounded by pretty trees\n* Its house looked exactly as it appeared on the street, and was very well renovated when he had visited\n\nThe house had none of those things that attracted him, so his thoughts were far from pleasant when he discovered that it would cost $90 for a single night's stay. But there was nothing else for him to do but to check out the house and take a night or two off work to spend a week there. Jennie needed an extra job to support herself as well, and it was a great chance for her to learn more about decorating and to see the world.\nWhen his name was called for check in, it was with mixed emotions that he saw the house that he was about to call home for the next three weeks. Jennie immediately knew that the house was not the house for her. The kitchen was small, the bathroom had a small window over the toilet. No, this was not going to work for her at all.\nIt was a house that was about a decade older than she was, but had an appealing design. She would have thought it would be nice, but when he opened the door, there he stood in a room that was dark and cool, and full of holes from the ceiling and down the walls of the room, and all of the windows had been taken off the wall and the frames of the windows were broken.\nNow, it was late afternoon, and he turned to walk away, but he was stopped from doing so by a door knob. An hour before he had been able to push his shoulder against the door knob and turn it, now the force of the door was coming through and pulling him into a new, strange room. He was being greeted with a heavy wooden door with no locks on it, and he was being shut out into a dark, damp basement room, with a few walls that had been torn out, and a bunch of the holes were still standing open. Even the door was rusted shut, there was not power to the house, so there was nothing keeping him in the room, now just a dark hole.\nHe turned around to go downstairs again and this time, he didn't have the choice. He stood there, unable to go down into what he hoped would be what he'd been expecting", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

It will also help the company with the fraud problems and the loss of revenue due to fraudulent transactions. b: c: D: e: f: G: I:\nOutput: 30\n\nThis question is meant for students who have not studied the economics of debit cards. Instead, you should be asking students to show you examples in terms that are in their daily lives. In which case, you may be able to come up with examples in other economic systems too.\n\nInstructions:Input: _____________a car rental company would be happy to see that some people used a debit card. This is to lower their credit card charge fees and reduce their debit card company fees. It will also make the company more efficient. It also means that the company can reduce their loss of revenue due to fraud. b: c:D: e: f:G:I:\nOutput:30\n\nInput: _____a car rental company only accepts checks. Students can use debit cards to avoid the cost of paying for their car or to cover a large portion of the check payment. A debit card can make all the difference with the charge and also cover the payment. b: c:E:D:E: f:G: I:\nOutput.30\n\nThis question is intended to show how some debit cards work. Students should have come across the debit card by now. A debit card is a small card that has a debit button. Students can put a small amount of cash in their card and then press debit. It will take a little while to see the money in the card, but once it happens it will not show up again.\n\nThis question is designed to show you more about card-based businesses than just banks. For example, think about how a small business will process an actual check or even a small credit card amount. Students might be able to come up to you with these ideas.", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

But if some of the plants and flowers that are close to each other are blooming on the same day, then the bees will be choosing flowers that are right in front of each other. Since the red flowers are so close to the cars, they are very likely to come in contact with the honey as they are drawn into the bees nest.\n\nThe correct answer is #2, so you did not submit the correct answer.\n\nIn this problem we need to know which of the following plants, if any, can be used by bees to attract insects to the flowers:\n\nOutput: You need to select four bees to visit each flower and record the bees that visit each flower. You record the information as follows. The first bee is to feed on the flowers and then be attracted by the red flower. The second bee is to feed on a bee. The third bee will be attracted by the red nectar and will fly away. Finally, the fourth bee is to return to the car and collect the honey.\n\nAnswer: 2\n\nThis answer is incorrect; the correct answer is 2\n\nIn this problem I need to know how many bees, in 100, can be attracted to any one flower:\n\nOutput: Using the formula below, how many bees can be attracted to each flower.\n\nInput: Using the formula below (using 100 as the number of bees), the first number, and the number of flowers to choose from (0 to 100), the second number, and the number chosen (1 to 100), the third number, and the number the flower has to attract (which is not part of the equation): the value is then divided by the number of flowers chosen, and the number of the bees you want to attract per flower.\n\nOutput: The first number is the number of bees you want to attract to a flower and the second number describes the number of flowers to chose from (1.0 being the least to attract that many bees). You want to multiply the value given above by (1 \u2013 the number chosen). The number of bees you want per flower should be proportional to the square root of the number you choose.", "answer": "D: rose garden"}

A flexible object that is stiff and flexible at the same time (a ball) is also a bag, but it must be held to be stretched or stretched a lot. Also to be stretched is a ball inside a bag.

{"text": "410\n\nI have a child that is 5'3\". I was asking what to do for the day when she came home from school. She had a friend with her (5'7\") that were making a lot of noise (mumbling and being annoying to say the least). I looked up at the ceiling and said, \"There's only one answer to this question: \"No.\"\nI would really appreciate your help! Is it okay to continue to let this happen? I have worked with her to control her noise level. My concern is that if I try to control her, she will start to resent me and start doing it herself.\n\n(Click to show or hide answer)\n\n* You need javascript enabled to see this answer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nI can't answer that question from your question, but I am going to answer it from your post here.\n\nIf you were trying to help your daughter, you're right. You need to control her noise level to give her some self respect. But if you keep \"fixing\" the problem you're helping her to develop a problem that she will use against you later in life - and that you will be paying for. If you can't control her, try and give her a good role model (I know - but is her problem really that you're not her role model?). Is the problem that she is talking to people at a distance and when they hear it make noise, she gets scared?\n\nIf she is not the problem, then it should be a natural thing to say \"No\", she doesn't need to know what you were thinking...\n\nI have read that children who are raised in a safe childhood setting exhibit behavior similar to that of adults. So this means if you could just talk to her and teach her to control her behavior, this would be helpful. You could also tell her that it is okay for her to mumble, but if she starts to yell, then to stop.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\nI have said the following before without hesitation to children.\n\nA. If I do what you say, the next thing you do is get mad. B. If you do what I say, I\u2019m going to get angry and hit you. C. If you do what i say, it\u2019s not my problem. D. If you do what he says, the next thing I say is I\u2019m not talking to him.", "answer": "B: applaud"}

How many cars would I need? I want a couple other cars to come and go to school, I need a couple cars that only come if I need them. How many cars would you need?\nOutput:???????\n\nWhat do you think of this question?\n\nThe Answer:\n\nThis question is a bit tricky because there are a lot of factors to consider. If you can consider the things below you can really make your choice very clear. If you know the answer to this question we can see if this is the right question for you.\n\nFirst we can consider the cost - this could only be so expensive as some parts of town only need one car. If your town will benefit from having more cars drive in, but will be effected if more people use one single road then you need more roads. If your town will be effected by using less space by putting one car at your door then you need more cars. In addition if you have a car that needs extra space then you want to have a car that is in the center of the road, for it to fit through your gate. So looking at these you can see some options in how you could split your space.\n\nIn addition to the cost factor though, think about how much space it will reduce your driveway to. For example if you live in a smaller town this could be big on the cost, but if your bigger town you may not mind, so to split up your space to have more cars and less driveway you could think of a method like buying extra car spaces, and even if you have to pay more for the space you have more room on the back end.\n\nIf you want more cars in your town you must consider if they are important to you. Most towns are full of local people, however these people use cars, so they may not care about this car as much as you do. The same people also don't want to drive out to their car to get things, so think hard about", "answer": "C: american city"}

For additional questions, the answer has to match the probability density function to achieve the answer.\n\nLet's say you wanted help with a physics test for college, where there is a probability density function such as this:\n\nAnd the desired question is:\n\nThen our answer would be, \"The probability density function for the population statistics from the previous question over a period of one day is: (the sum of)2.\"\n\nThis might not be exactly what you are looking for, though.\n\nIf you wish to find the density function for \"population\", you have to make a few additional modifications. First, we can change what the population numbers are from the previous question, which are \"people (1, 2, 3, 4)\", by just removing people 0, 1, and 2. Our solution would still work, but it would no longer include the other variables.

Your input was the correct answer. \"Riding a bike through rough terrain can only be dangerous when it is too rough and you are not skilled in it\" does not apply to recreational riders.\n\nAnswer: (A)\n\nThe objective is to write the following sentence to show how to construct a sentence.\n\nI am writing a sentence that will show how to construct a structure sentence.\n\nMy sentence cannot begin nor end but if I follow the rules, it will.\n\nThe beginning is a prepositional phrase and an end is a preposition. We are not allowed to include the words \"or\" and \"but\" in the sentence since they do not appear in the sentence (that would be redundant and would get in the way of this).\n\nThe preposition \"or\" is not allowed in sentences that end a sentence with only one preposition.\n\nThe preposition is a common preposition. Not all prepositions of this kind are allowed and therefore not all common prepositions can end sentences. Ex: if I were to say:\"I am writing a sentence\", \"write\" becomes one of the options.\n\nAs long as there is at least one preposition in the sentence, prepositions are allowed. The preposition can only be used with a sentence that is not dependent upon one preposition and then it can end the sentence.\n\nThe preposition \"but\" is an irregular preposition. When used in a sentence alone, it can end the sentence, but when used in some other form of sentence, it can only do that. Therefore, it is a bad preposition to use, because it can put an ambiguity in writing. Because of this, as long as it shows that something is dependent on \"and\".\n\nThe preposition, \"yet\", is a conditional preposition. When used \"yet\" can never be used in conjunction with a sentence ending with \"not\" or a subject that starts with \"me\" or \"I\". The only way to use this preposition in a sentence is if it shows that something is conditional on some sort of future state. So this preposition, like the aforementioned \"or\", is not allowed.\n\nWhen using prepositions, only one of them can show that something is conditional. For example, it is possible to end a sentence with a preposition, \"yet\" and one additional preposition. The preposition ending with \"", "answer": "E: falling down"}

{"text": "5\n\nI don't see why all schools should be allowed to get loans so easily, but in fact it is only the elite schools that can access loans. The school that I went to got a loan, but not the school that I went to, it is really unfair as the elite schools have a lot more money to use in loans. I believe that student loan should be granted only for the elite students, or the school should give students a small loan just to attend and take an exam so that at least the school is able to earn some interest out of it.\n\nWhen I was a student, there were many other things that cost money. It was not just for tuition and books. There was a fee for the library to open late and a fee to get on the school bus. I don't see how a student should be granted a loan just for being in a school.\n\nA: The only fees for school buses are for toll passes and tickets. A student is not granted a loan just because he is in a school. If they do give out loans, it should be a one time loan of $10,000 instead of a loan for the school for the entire year.\nQ: At your school, the library was open late. How do you think this affects you?\nA: I think that this does affect me because I could not study if the library was open late after school because I was tired and I would just stay to watch TV.\nQ: At Yale, there was a fee for library access in the night. Did you ever use this?\nA: I rarely used these fees so I guess it did not affect me.\nQ: Were you in the majority of the people who use the library at the same time?\nA: I don't think so. There was rarely other people there. I remember there were around 20 of us.\nQ: At Harvard the library was open late at night. Did you ever benefit from this?\nA: No I did not benefit from this because I felt that the library was closed most of the time, so if the library was open after night classes, I would have to stay to watch TV. Sometimes after my classes the library would be open and I would not want to leave to study because I didn't want to miss the TV.\nQ: What if there was a fee for getting on the school bus?\nA: I do not see the fee for getting on the bus being very useful, I know", "answer": "D: hat rack"}

{"text": "300\n\nIn the course of his work, he began to hear rumors of the atrocities committed by the Nazis in World War II. That is when the government tried to suppress these rumors in the 1950s, and the U.N. decided to condemn them. When this law was enacted in 1968, the government started to prosecute these \u201crumors\u201d and prosecute those who spread them. In the U.S., we have a similar law, called the Freedom of Information Act, to protect these types of rumors. If an individual is afraid that a rumor about them will hurt them, and they know what is the proper name for such a rumor, what kind of protections do they want?\n\nThe first thing that must be brought up with the person is, \u201cHow will knowing your name make you worry that people might discover that you are an \u2018usurer\u2019 or a defiler?\u201d If the answer is that it would make them worried, then that answer is correct, since \u201cusurer\u201d was once a common term of scorn. A better term, however, that may be more appropriate would be \u201cshameful.\u201d That term might seem more fitting as the term for someone who is embarrassed of their name. Although, if the answer is that they would be afraid to tell about themselves because they know that people might discover that they are an \u201cusurer\u2019 or \u201cdefiler\u201d then that statement is most likely incorrect. Even if the answer is something that would make them embarrassed about their name (i.e. \u201cThey would think that I am a \u2018dear\u2019\u201d), that statement should still be true. In fact, if the answer is something else that will make them feel ashamed then that statement should also be true. Another thing that must be brought into the equation is some measure of guilt, because shame is one of the most powerful emotions; if the person fears they will go to jail (or worse) for being an \u201cusurer,\u201d or even is afraid that they could be hurt by their name, then that person is indeed likely guilty. However, if the person actually believes that their own name has harmed them, as well as knowing that their family and their friends and their boss might be hurt too, then that situation is very different. For example, if a person realizes that he is a \u201cgentle\u201d man who always follows the rules (which makes him an \u201cus", "answer": "C: anger"}

{"text": "310\nIf a person just woke up and asked each and every member of his or her family, each and every friend and every workmate how they did today, a significant proportion of respondents would be in the wrong. Those asked about what they had gained would always be wrong and those who didn't care would always be right.\n### Explanation:\nYour audience consists of five people who do not know how to do anything, which means that each answers will be wrong. The number of people who would think that you are in the position that the five can't imagine you are in is larger than the number who believe what you say, which is that you're awake.\n### Submitted on Thu, 02/03/2008 - 22:37.\n### Response:\n\nInput:\nThe average monthly mortgage payments of a one- family home in this area will be $2,600 which equals about 4 days' worth of groceries. Which amount would you think the house cost?\nOutput:\nAssuming that these amounts are true and that the person who made them does so in good faith, then he or she would be incorrect. If this person were correct, the people who were wrong would be unable to imagine that a one- family home costs more than $300 (at the median price of 3,541 dollars) per month; in which case the difference in gross monthly expenses would have more than been paid for.\n### Explanation\nThe \"average\" is a very misleading statistic. Most people don't need to know how to budget and do chores in order to live well - the average household has more than what the data shows. While the calculation here is not precise, we need to be able to put the average in proper perspective. People have been asked to work from home and their expenses have more than doubled - they are now spending money that did not exist before - and many people in the U.S. cannot live on $300 a month.\n### Submitted Thu, 02/03/-22:41.\n### Response:", "answer": "A: drink tea"}

Take $1(x \u2212 y)$ to set the cost for 10 days to be $3.50 per day (which is 4.5 days). Then divide the rental cost by 10 to get $3.50 + 4.5 = $1.5.\n\nSolution for Question 2:\n\nWe want to know the total amount of days that Jennie spent at this location. We assume that it costs $160/week to rent this car for her trip. So, we set $y$ to $15, $x$ to be $230, and $y$ to be $15/week = 16. This leaves us $20 for the first week ($230) and $60 for the second week. Therefore, the total price is $120. We multiply the price by $30 and then divide by $12 to get $60.\n\nHere is our answer to the second question as a solution (note that this is an exact fit):\n\nThe answer is $30\n\nWe can also solve the second question using two variables: $20+20\u221220=40 and $20 = $1/4$\n\nInput: where is at $1, $60, $140, $60, $50.

In the store, the man asks if he should buy a bottle of wine. A storekeeper tells him that he has to use cash, so the man pays $6.35. During the transaction, the man gives the storekeeper a $20 bill, and the storekeeper asks him to pay the 6.35 in cash, or the man will give the man a $20 bill. The man agrees to do this. The storekeeper then tells him that he is now free to leave if he wishes. The man declines to leave because he has only $20. The storekeeper asks him to return in a week, and if he returns, he will reward the man with $10. The storekeeper then informs him that he can buy the wine in a week if he chooses to make the purchase now. The man agrees. After the man leaves, the storekeeper asks to see his $20 bill. The storekeeper takes the man\u2019s bill and examines it closely. He sees that it looks different than what he was given. He tells the man that he has not been paid the right amount for the wine. The man angrily tells the storekeeper that what he is calling a mistake, and demands to see what he paid for the wine. The storekeeper gives the man the bill and tells him that it was his money in the first place. The man continues to stand in front of the store, angrily demanding to see where he paid for the wine before he begins to walk away. The storekeeper tries, every possible way, to dissuade him from his demand. Finally the storekeeper tells the man to leave, he will not allow him to walk out until he has had the wine! After the man leaves, he returns to the store the next day, but is told the storekeeper has no wine. The man then makes a report", "answer": "E: laundry room"}

How much, in total, will her medical fees, from the accident, cost?\nOutput: 9,500\n\nI've also found some great resources on the internet regarding computerized tests. The computerized tests are often referred to as MCAS (McAuliffe Assessment, Testing and Reporting system), or PARCC (Program to Evaluate and Rating Children for Cognition and Development). The PARCC assessment is the most common test of this kind in classrooms today in the U.S. The PARCC assessment (and other computerized tests) provides a detailed look at each pupil\u2019s reading level, writing abilities, and the ability to understand information. Through these assessments, education workers know how to help their students to succeed.\n\nThe PARCC assessment is fairly comprehensive (it covers everything up to 16th grade and includes information from reading (first grade) to math (16th grade)) and is used across the country (it is used in the UK, among other countries; it is also one of the tests used in most states).\n\nI feel like computerized tests are great tools for education workers to assess learning, and they can be an effective way to keep an eye on student achievement. However, one of the drawbacks is that computerized tests can be difficult to interpret. As explained in my previous post, computerized tests are built on several different systems, which have their own idiosyncrasies and strengths.\n\nOne other problem with computerized assessments is that the results can be skewed. This can happen if multiple assessments\u2014like one administered by different testing firms\u2014are used to test a single student. A student with a poor score on one assessment could get a high score on another assessment. As a result, the score on the first test may be skewed lower than the score on a different test administered by a different testing firm.\n\nWhen the test results end up being skewed, it undermines the results of the test when students begin to use the computerized scores to predict their grades. This can lead students and teachers alike to make unfair judgments about the value of the test on their own scores, which can increase the amount of studying that is required (time that would otherwise be spent focusing on the actual learning activity) while also undermining the overall learning experience.\n\nThe PARCTech tests", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

Freud, having learned to identify himself with his father as a Jewish, educated, upper-middle-class German family, was not familiar with the many ways in which sex could be a function of culture, class, gender, and many other factors. Freud, himself a student of psychology, was also less well versed in the various modes of sexual expression available to heterosexuals; Anna Freud was a practicing lesbian.\nWith the advent of the Sexual Enlightenment of the late 19th century, the study of sexuality entered a new age and brought Freud and his wife Mary in touch with women's sexuality, both within relationships and outside of them (especially in relation to their extended family), and with the development of Freud's theories about sexuality and the family that emerged in the course of the '50s and '60s.\nThe '70s gave way to the '80s when Freud began to think about sexuality more broadly. His own daughters had begun to question his assumptions about sexuality, especially when it came to marriage. Freud's own attitude towards marriage was also affected by his work with his wife, Mary, throughout the '60s and '70s, a period in which Freud had been involved, in the first instance with his wife, in what could best be called an adulterous affair in the 1960s, when he believed Mary was not sexually attracted to him, and, with the eventual addition of a third wife (Margarete) in the '70s, Freud realized he might have been sleeping with his wife.\n\nWhile this is not the story I told my class in college (a fictional one, I will admit), I believe it is a great example of how Freud came to think about gender as linked to sexuality.\nMany people who believe homosexuality is an orientation or vice will not find your example of Anna Freud a particularly attractive one, but to my eyes, it is as relevant as that of my own parent's.\nTo some, homosexuality is an orientation or a vice, while to others, it isn't.

Output: 310\n\n\"Give\" versus \"Receive\"\n\n\"Give\" or \"Return Value\" is an equation where both the \"give\" and the \"receive\" are monetary.  \"Give\" is a cost and \"receive\" is a price. The return value is the average value of what was given plus or minus what was received by the \"giveer.\"  The amount of \"receive\" is added to the money received to calculate the amount of income the \"giveer\" is getting.  This is the sum of the \"receivee\" and \"giveer's\" income.\n\nAn example of a \"give\" situation would be a loan.  A person makes a loan to someone else.  Then, when the loan is paid back and the person stops making monthly payments, the balance of the loan is now due on the \"giveee\", not the \"give\" - since the person still has a right to the property.  The bank may write that debt off in a tax deduction.\n\nAn example where the amount given is \"receiveable\" would be a gift.  Instead of giving a dollar amount, it may be a donation that the \"giveer\" puts towards paying for something someone else purchases with the \"give\" amount.\n\nSome ideas to \"give\" are:\n\nGiving money\n\nGiving a present\n\nGiving food\n\nGiving shelter to another\n\nGiving a home to another\n\nGiving information\n\nGiving a gift certificate so that the \"giveer pays for the good he/she wants, not the product or service\"\n\nGiving money at one store, and not having to go to another store to buy the same gift\n\nGiving a free ride on a bus, if someone else is riding the bus.  The \"giveer\" does not have to go pay for the ride because he/she wants to give the \"free ride\"\n\nGiving to someone you do not know personally - someone you give an order to, something you need to take care of, someone that needs money.\n\nGiving money to some friends to give to others.  This is not as much a \"give\" as is it is an \"exchange.\"\n\nGiving money\nThere are many forms of", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

Three of her children were married, and were very happy. Her third son Joe Jr. had a problem. He had a problem with his eyes. He found himself often saying things which were untrue. When people tried to explain him, he would make little faces at them, to draw their attention to his mistakes. He became invisible.\nJoe\u2019s doctor saw this problem in him and put him in a special eye treatment, which improved his sight dramatically. He soon found the same problem again. So, he did what he did with Joe Jr., and put him in a different type of treatment. At first this helped greatly, but then it also made his eyes smaller and more noticeable than before. Before he would say anything, and everyone then would think Joe had a problem. He became much more invisible. If people wanted to talk to him, they would often have to ask him. He soon became very worried, and often hid himself.\n\nNow Jane and Joe could no longer afford to take him to the sight therapy, so they took Joe to the eye specialists, to ask about more treatments. He found that, while the treatment was quite effective, Joe Jr. could not ever speak enough to be heard.

{"text": "315\n\n(This version)\nIf we are in an environment with light, we would know how we can use our shadows. For instance we can see the surface of the air with a shadow and use the shadow to guide us to the object in our environment. In reality, we don't use shadows but we use the air we can see with shadow to guide our movements. If we use the air, we will know that we need to look in different direction to know where we can pick up the object. If we see with the air, we will need our shadows because we would not know where we can pick stuff up with the air. So how is our use of shadows helping us to know where to look for the objects that we want to pick up?\nThat is a really interesting question, but it depends on our objective. Is it for finding the object in a certain area? Is it to get from one place to another? Is it to look for an object in a certain way?\nIt depends on your objective.\n\nIn the next post, let us have a look at how the use of the shadows helps us to find the objects that we want in a place.", "answer": "A: television"}

{"text": "300\n\nIn this example, there is one word - shoe as in shoe or as in shoe. The word of the day is noun. Now it is possible to make a sentence with multiple verb forms, which is what is required.\n\nOutput: Bob ran from the corner store to the other side of town. You could write:  Bob ran from the corner Store to his house. But you would also like to add a verb like, for example,  He ran from the corner Shop to his house. As soon as you do that and the verb are combined, you have an example of a sentence using the verb form multiple - verb and the noun form noun - noun.\n\nThe last example is what I expected. It was not very tricky, though the second sentence didn't seem to fit. The verb is not used in the sentence - Bob ran from the corner shop to his street. It is used in the sentence - He ran from the corner shop. So the word of the day is not either noun - shop or noun - word of the day.\n\nYou might try answering each category on the left with - noun - verb or adjective.\n\nYou see how this sentence gets confusing when you combine the verb form verb - verb and the noun - adjective - verb. And the last example is tricky. The word of day in the above sentence is not used to show the verb form verb verb - verb, but just to state that it is the verb - verb used in the previous sentence.\n\nOne question is what verb would you use if you put both nouns and verbs, like you have in the last example? If you use both nouns and verbs as you have in the sentence, the question is, which one would you use?\n\nFor the other questions, you'll need to do the following:\n\nIf you put both nouns - noun - noun, put in one noun after another, as in example 5, the answer is noun - noun, meaning that the verb form verb - noun is used. If you put in an adjective - adjective - noun, you'll need to put in one adjective before another, as in example 6, in which case the answer is adjective - adjective - noun. If you put in the adjective - adjective - verb, then you've gotten mixed up: adjective - adjective - noun - verb. So use only adjective - adjective - noun and adjective - adjectives - adjectives, such as in example 7.\n\nTo keep your answers", "answer": "D: city block"}

Divide the person's income (from the income statement you can also compare to an online income statement) into one or more credit limit settings (credit limit as percentage of income). The actual credit limit will be determined by your credit score, not by credit cards. The credit card company may have a credit limit (usually 1-2 times the limit on the card) that they set for each card. Once you calculate an estimate, you will have a credit score, and it will help you in getting a loan or a mortgage.\n\nAssignment:Assumptions:\nIn order to understand this question accurately, you need to read and analyze several credit scores from major credit bureaus.", "answer": "B: city"}

Even the students have time to go to the gym. Most of my friends that are in college or college students go to college there as well although college here isn't cheap.\n\nIn your opinion, what makes it a great school? - I'm just curious as to what makes it such a great school. When I looked into college's I had never heard of Cornell or Dartmouth, so I was a little skeptical of Cornell and had not heard of Dartmouth before.\n\nIn your example: Jennie rented a car. The rental agency charges $30/ day for a car, or 190 for the first week for the rental that lasts an entire weeks or longer. Jennie and her friend only rented a car for 11(?) days. How much would they have to pay for the rental? - Jennie would have to pay about 310, if she is a student in school.\n\nI have been living at my mom's house since August and that has been the worst decision that I have ever made. I've been forced to pay rent for a room that I only pay about a dollar extra for every month in the summer (not that I mind paying rent, but it doesn't leave me many options for spending the money) and to go to class when I don't have any classes is definitely not my best time. I have not been in the town too much, so I haven't really had to worry about what's going on there. We do go out to eat all the time though.\n\nI have to say that I'm really happy I chose to transfer here though because I think Cornell can be great if you just stay on top of your papers and assignments. I've never thought they were that hard.\n\nAnother thing that I would say as an extrovert, Cornell is definitely not great for extroverts like me.

{"text": "620\n\n1 Answer\n\n1\n\nOne reason why certain people feel they need to change the nature of society is to end poverty, poverty is what causes social and economic problems, once people stop being trapped by poverty they have a much better chance to change the situation and get rid of poverty.\n\nOther reasons is because it means less government waste, which is actually a good thing for people. People who have no government spending have little way to spend tax money so it\u2019s not just wasted either they have to give it away that\u2019s bad for other people.\n\n2\n\nAnother way is you could just start out a band, get your money and do what ever you want with them. Or you could get an organization to start with social change, and if done right it could become one of the best in the world, just get your money and get your own things right that\u2019s how you become a leader, not many people actually have the ability to start out that way, but if you do you can do some really great things.\n\nPeople who just want to protest against injustice can start a protest group or just a sit-in, and the reason why it is better to start from within means that people are more likely to change when they see the power they have.\n\nOther reasons to start from within is what if you got an organization like the United Nation\u2019s to come to you, but they are doing things for poor people in the world, but still they need you, this is a great opportunity for you, if you can keep doing this stuff all your life, then you have a great position, in a century or two you could have another chance for an organization just like that, it also gives you a reason for doing it because even if you have a lot of money, you can continue the good work.\n\nPeople who say you need to change society should work from within the system as long as they don\u2019t try to make a new system, because a new system would be just another form of oppression.", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

Then they'll still feel like there's a good chance they can guess a few more answers and do well!\n\nAlso: If you have a group of students assigned an answer at first, but they end up guessing, ask them to try guessing the two things that got them to the right answer.

{"text": "1,065\n\nAnswer:To find out about the amount of effort you needed to keep in a relationship.\n\nYou may have noticed that the answers to the two questions below are not the same. The answer to Question 1 is the same as the answer to Question 2\n\nBut, the answer to Question 2 is different from the answer to Question 1 - how do you explain this?\n\nAnswer : I explain the answer in the following manner:\n\nThis question is a simple question about probability and its application to a particular problem. It is a basic probability problem in which there are two possible answers, each having a different probability. The probability for A to be true is the probability that the car is available and would be returned on time. For B to be true, but less likely, the car is unavailable. Both probabilities for A to be true are one.\n\nSo, the best thing to do is ask people why they feel that way and don't expect your answers to fully explain why you think that - all you can do is share your answer for the question, and hope people will see whether your answer is similar to others or not.\n\nThe best thing to do is make a guess. You can do this by asking your audience what kind of answer they prefer - the simplest version is to get them to guess and then you can get them to make you a guess. If you ask a bunch of people the same question and get 5 different answers then maybe you can get 50% guessing and 50% guessing (since the odds would be 4 to 1 that you get the same answer as someone else), if you're lucky, that number would be 100%.\n\nI have an opinion that the best answer is different than all the others answers - if the best answer comes from a small audience of people then perhaps it is because they are more likely to be influenced by it. I could be completely wrong about this but my guess is that for each \"right answer\" you receive, about half of the audience didn't receive it and half just didn't know you wanted it.\n\nI'd like to hear your opinion, that is, what sort of answer you would prefer. I think you'd have to be very clear about whether you prefer the answers that are given or those based on your own guess - if the answer was based on an open ended guess it could be just as hard to predict as the answer based on an open ended answer.\n\nI suppose you can't get any more objective", "answer": "D: popularity"}

The cow would have to live 40 miles away and walk 25 miles each day, 10 of which would be uphill. Then, the next day, when she returned for her daily feeding, she might gain 5 new pounds. In the end she lost 50 pounds. How much straw did she lose total over a year?\nOutput: 1200\n\nInput:A blind dog knows where he is, and can see well enough to turn around and follow a human.

For most students, dance is a source of joy. It is fun. It's something they look forward to, which means they will enjoy learning the music even more.\n\nWe just had our first dance in December. It was a success. We had approximately 40 students attend it. Many of them did not know a word of music, and for a few of them, music is not their sport, it's simply what they like. In fact, a lot of them were afraid of going. They were very nervous, but they took a chance and said, \"I'd better try it.\" They all had a wonderful time.\n\nI think we can get better at encouraging all our students to try new things, whether it's a class dance, musical theater, a choir, drama, or a school dance. We can start putting in the time and effort to help them achieve this. This can make so much difference.\n\nWe have a lot of students who are self-motivated, but not very good at math.

Car rental agencies like a clean environment because they like it clean. This is because cleanliness can improve customer satisfaction with the agency.\nOne reason how a clean environment improves customer satisfaction with a car rental agency is because they feel more professional. Car rental companies do not want customers to feel that they are not professional because the company is dirty. Car rentals require the companies to be clean because customers will not feel that they are feeling professional because they are in cars that have a bad appearance. Car rentals like a clean environment because it shows that their car rental company is professional.\n\nWhen people look for Car Rentals, they need to feel informed. If the information they are provided is not at hand, they will have trouble choosing from the list of cars available. The information they want should be available within the rental agency. Car rental companies should always give accurate information. They should not tell customers what they should do and not to do, because that is dangerous to customers. They should be helpful in making a decision to rent a car.\n\nCar rental agents are not only responsible for providing accurate information, but also for answering all customer questions.

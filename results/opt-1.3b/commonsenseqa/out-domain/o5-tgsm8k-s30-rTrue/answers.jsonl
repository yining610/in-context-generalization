Of those 5 students, A is the best student, B is the worst-performing student, and C is the most average-performing student.  For each student, the professor wants to create a random distribution of one of three categories:  A: 100% in class and homework, B: 0% in class and homework but spends almost every moment sleeping, C: 0% in class, homework, and socialising.  What do the stats say for each category?\nOutput: The professor creates a random distribution of students in each category and for each of the categories, there is a single student. There are 5 students in each category. The random distributions have a mean of 100% so A=100% and C=0%\nThere are 5 students in the A category in the professor\u2019s sample, A=0%C=0%.\nSo the final answer for A is 100% and B is 0% and C is the average and average = 1, the average student is C and the average student is a C.\n\nInput: There are 80 cars in a city and 12 houses.

The cars are all rented for $30/day and the agency charges an additional $10/day per person for the weekend.  The company sends a total of 1,000 miles per day during the month of April to be used for business trips.  If all but half of these travelers were women, of what proportion should each woman make her trips to the job interviews?\nOutput: Each woman would need to rent a car with a capacity of 120 passengers.\nEach woman could need to rent 2 cars, because the trip duration is about 2 hours.\nIf the trip duration is 2 hours, then each woman needs 2 cars (2)*2=<<2*2=8>>8\nIf the trip duration has an average duration time of 2 hours, then the total rental costs for each woman are 5*8**2 = $<<5+8=156>>156\nSo the final answer for each woman is $156/156 = <<5+8=156>156 dollars.\nSo the final total with $156/156=<<5+8=956>>956 dollars\n\nInput:An airline offers $200 round trip air tickets for anyone who can travel to New York City in one day.

Outcome: None\nOutput: If a cat is caught with the fly in a house, the cat eats $39.00 worth of food each day.\nThe total number of meals and snacks eaten by the cats would be $60.00.\nThus, each meal eaten is $60.00 x 6 days = $120.00\nSo the total number of meals and snack consumed by the cats is $120.00 + $3900/$60 = $240.00\nThus, each meal= $60 x 6 days = $4880.00\nAfter deducting the food costs from the $480.00 amount of money used to feed the cats, then we know the total is $3680.00\nThus, a cat eats $4880.00 a day\n\nInput: The average income per capita in a state is $18,400.

(72.36 * 2 = $664.00)\nTotal salary ($1,500 + 664.00) is $16,375.\nThus, a family of 4 needs a monthly income of $2425.00.\nSo the number of employees required to work at the same level of income as the household that owned a home costs $2425.00/2.75x75 = $1525\nSo the number of workers needed equals 4 times $1525\nThus, the family will need an annual income of $33,125.00\nThus, housing the family will cost $33.125 times $1525/4x75= $3095\nThus,", "answer": "E: blotter"}

As he cuts his hair, the barber cuts the man\u2019s beard into a mullet and the man thinks that the man is cutting his hair, so he says, \u201cThank you, so much!\u201d  How does this relate to this question?\nOutput: A mullet, like an undercut hair style, requires that the hair be shaved into a mullet.\nA mullet and an undercut hair style are the same thing, but the phrase, \u201cthank you so much!\u201d implies that the barber was cutting the hair. Therefore, in order to fit the requirement of having a mullet, the hair must be shaved into the mullet and there must be no shaving of the hair into a mullet. Therefore, the barber is not cutting the hair and the phrase, \u201cThank you so much!\u201c implies that the barber is giving the money back.  Thus, in order to fit this requirement, the hair must be cut into a mullet.  Therefore, the phrase, \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d is incorrect because it implies that the barber wants to tell the man that he was not shaving his hair away and that he wanted to shave some money from the man\u2019s money. Therefore, to fit this requirement, \u201csorry\u201d is no substitute for \u201cthank you.\u201d  Since the phrase \u201cThank you so many times\u201d implies that the man thanked the barber for shaving the hair, then \u201cthank you so many times\u201c would be correct.  However, \u201cthank you that you wanted to try a mullet\u201c would not be correct because it does not say that the man wanted to try a mullett. Accordingly, according to your answer \u201cthank you so thank so much\u201d is incorrect because there is no indication that the barber gave the man a mullet when he cut his hair.

Over time, these pigs will lose 1/5th of their body weight (in pounds). If the pigs eat every day from now until April, how much will they eat? Also, how many would these pigs require to feed?\nOutput: The animals require 3, 2, 3 and 2/3 pounds of food a day. Therefore, four pigs need 3, 2, 2/3 and 2/3 pounds a day in order to survive.\nEach pig will require 1/3 pound of food a day of food.\nTherefore, we need 3, 2, 12*3 = 60 pounds of food per pig to feed each day.\nIt can be assumed that each pig will eat 1/3 pound of bacon a day.\nTherefore, the total food required by four pigs is 60*40 = 3, 990 pounds of food a day\nGiven that each pig will consume 60 pounds of food each day, it can be assumed that each will consume 60+40 = 270 pounds of bacon a day. As there are three pigs and 270 pounds of food, the total amount needed is 27, 990 pounds of bacon.\nSince the pigs require 1 pound a day for 30 days to feed their bodies, the total amount needed by three pigs is 108,270 pounds of bacon.\nThus, the total amount needed to feed both the pigs and the dog will be 108,270 pounds of food.\nGiven that the dog needs 30 of the 108,270 pounds to live, the total amount needed will be 9,980 pounds of food.\nTherefore the total amount needed to meet the needs of the dog, both dog and cat and the pig will be 108,270*30 = 57,080 pounds of food per month.\nGiven that the pigs eat 60, 180*60 = 600 pounds of food a day, the total amount needed for them to be fed is 2,920,180 pounds of food.\nThe total amount needed for humans to live on this food in one month will be 5,940,180 pounds of food (excluding animal food).\nSince 60/600 = 30, the total amount needed in one month will be 20,040,180 food.\nThe total food needed to support the human diet in a month is 5,940,180 + 10,000,120 = 20,040,", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

The next year would have a total income $2,200 a year.\nOutput: Assume three children have been born in a month and that total income is at $2,000, a total income $2200 for the next year would be expected after having 3 children.\nOutput: Ass assume $2,200 was earned in a month and the following number of children can be imagined: three children born in a month, and an additional $4,000 earned for each extra child to $24,000 in total income for the year following.\nOutput: Assuming the three children each have their own house, income for the year following from all children would be $20,000. It would be difficult to pay this much income from just children.\nOutput: What would be the income in the year that follows with four children total to $24,000?\nOutput: Ass assume that the 4 children each have their own money, and a total income of $25,000 for the year following would be needed after having four children.\nOutput: Assuming $25,000 was earned in the month and the four children can be imagined: four children born in a month for a total income of $30,000, the", "answer": "C: bridge"}

Choose one or both of the following: A: dairy cattle B: pigs C: sheep D: goats\nOutput: Soybean meal = soybeans, and corn = corn\nSince the corn is added to the diet of each animal, the resulting animal has more soybeans than corn. Hence, the animal has more corn in its stomach than the animal with no corn in its stomach. So the animal with the more soybeans in its stomach takes the higher amount of soybean meal in digesting the soybeans. Thus, the animal with the more of the corn taken in digesting the corn takes the greater amount of the corn in the stomach. So the animal that has more soy in its stomach takes the greater amount of corn. Thus, the animal that has the corn taken in the stomach takes the greater amount than the animal without any corn in its stomach.\nSo the animal with the more corn taken in digesting corn takes the greater number of grains in digesting the corn.\nSo the animal that has the more corn taken in the stomach digesting corn takes the smaller number of grains in digest the corn, while the animal that has the higher amount of soy in the stomach takes the other grain quantity in the digestive process and takes the corn in its stomach. Thus the animal with the more maize taken in digesting the maize takes the greater amount of maize in the digestive process.\nSo the animal taking the corn in the stomach digestion process will take the greater amount of the maize in the digestive process and take the smaller amount of corn", "answer": "D: symphony"}

Thus, he would have $25,000*5,800.12 = $125,500\n$125,500*5,800.11 = $2,150,000\nTherefore, $125,500 * 2,150,000 = $1,750,000\nSince John has two additional homes, he can purchase each home at $1.70 million each!!!\nSo, the final answer is 1,750,000\n\nInput: Michael is selling a horse.

The pitcher throws the catch as well.\nOutput:In which direction does the game start, and in what direction does it end?\nOutput:There are three balls in play.  Each balls has a different spin on it. The first ball has a faster spin so it is thrown in the same direction. The second ball has a slower spin so it is thrown out in the opposite direction from the first ball. The third ball has a slower spin than the second so it is thrown into the same direction as the first ball.\nThus, the pitcher throws the first ball in one direction, the second ball in the opposite direction, and the third ball in the opposite direction.

The cost of utilities, lawn maintenance, and upkeep is calculated by $400*75=<<50*76=140>>140\nThis calculation does not include the extra cost of the condo fees.  The extra cost of the condo fee is calculated by $1000(<<1000*70=>140) in this scenario.  The extra cost is the total charge by the condo board.  The condo board will charge you a yearly maintenance fee of $450 for the condo.  The additional cost of the fee is $450 x 100 = $1900.  Because you are not paying $1900 per year for the fee, you simply need to multiply this cost by 20 to calculate the total expenses.  The total expense, per year, is $1900*50 = $2500.  This means you must pay $4000 per year for the condo.  That amount is the total cost of renting your condo (total fee + condo fees).  It takes $2600 x 50=$4000 to pay for the condo.  So you divide $2600 by 20 (2500) to calculate the total cost of renting the condo: $4000 x 20", "answer": "B: symphony orchestra"}

The cost per unit of electricity is $2.00. The cost per month to heat the house is $800, and the cost per unit of electricity per month is $3.00.  The family owns a car.  The cost per year to drive is $0; the cost per month to drive the car is $10; the cost per unit of fuel is $15 and the cost per month to fuel the car is $100.\nThe family owns two dogs, and lives in the city.  The cost to feed, water, and house both dogs is $600.00  They also have two cats. How much does it cost them to fuel the vehicles, maintain the house, feed, water, and shelter the animals?\nOutput: The animals receive only $60.00 a month as fuel, and the vehicles cost $180.00 to fuel. The cost to maintain the animals is $1,400.00 per year. So the family\u2019s total cost for fuel, maintenance, health care and shelter for the animals would be $30,000.00.\nSo the final output is $30,000\n\n (1) The family owns three dogs. The total cost of food, water, and house for the dogs is $1500.00. The cost of food for the family and the dogs in the city each month is $1,600.00.  The dog\u2019s expenses are $15 each month. The family\u2019s expenses are thus $15,900.00.\n (2) The family owns two dogs. They receive $600 per month as fuel. The cost to fuel the car and to maintain the house is $150. The animal\u2019s expenses are also $15. The total family expenses for both the animals and the car is $6,750/150=$6,750/month= $12,500/month.\n (3) The family owns one dog. They receive $300 per month as fuel. Cost to purchase food each month = $150. Their expenses are thus $300/150=$300/month=$750. Their family expenses are thus thus $500/150=$50/month=$750 yearly.\n\n (4", "answer": "A: kitchen"}

The children were angry with Jill for taking all of the credit for their mother and grandmother\u2019s new toys. They thought that the things that she had bought were not nice. They wanted a more equal gift. When Jill reminded them that it was her grandmother\u2019s time of needs and that they had not been helped, the children could hardly believe what she had just said!

{"text": "The gambler won $3000, he chose A\n\nInput: A family of 3, one parent is unmarried and is not earning any income. The other parent is a single adult, and works 60 hours a week. The children of the family are 9 brothers and 15 sisters. The income of the parent who is not working is $80,000.00 per year. The income of the parents is $100,000.00 per month. The per-child income of the family is $2,500.00. If the parents earn $100,000. 00 monthly, each child of the family receives $500.00 per month after taxes. As the parents both work, each child also earns income each month. If the parents earn 40% of the income of the family, each child earns a little over $500.00 in income per month after taxes. So the total income of the family is about $16,500.00. The parents are married, and earn $2,500. 00 monthly, their children each receive $2,500. 0100 after taxes.

Can he claim the missed vacation for tax year 17 in 2007?\nOutput: He still wants to meet the tax criteria and only takes home $500.00 in compensation for the missed vacation, so there is no net loss to the tax year.\nIf the man is claiming the missed vacation for the tax year 2007, even though he did not meet the tax year requirements due to his vacation, if he was paid $500.00 in total compensation for the lost vacation, this will be counted as a gross loss for the tax year.\nTherefore, since the amount taken home ($500.00) is less than his compensation ($2,500.00), no net income has been gained or lost. In 2007 that is not relevant in the equation. so there was no net loss to the year.\nThus, no net loss on the year ended in 2007 has been caused. therefore no tax year 17 compensation was taken. thus his overall net loss for 2007 did not increase. There is no net gain.\nSo, as long as it is not a net loss, he can still take the vacation for the tax year of 2007 tax", "answer": "B: cash in"}

While he waits five years for interest on his debts to start going back toward his initial amount, how many years does it take for his returns to exceed the 10% that he borrowed?\nOutput: The annualized total returns from five years of borrowing $400,000 is $120,000, for a cumulative total annualized total return of $360,000\nIf he had borrowed only 30% of his annualized total return from 5 years of borrowing $400k, then his cumulative total annualized return would be $100,000, a cumulative total $180,000\nSince he borrowed only 30% of the annualized total return, he should not have accumulated any cumulative total annualized total returns above $180,000. Thus, his yearly cumulative total return does not exceed $180,000 and he should retire on time.\nOutput:\nIf he had borrowed 10% of his annualized $360,000 total return, his cumulative total annualized total was $180,000 (because he has borrowed 30% of the annual adjusted return for 5 years).\nSo after five years, his cumulative annualized total return is $180,000 (since he has borrowed 30% per year for 5 years).\nAnd the cumulative total annualized return after five years is $240,000\nThus, his yearly cumulative total returns do not exceed $180,00 and he should retire on 10 years, not 5. Thus, he has not exceeded his yearly total return cap and he should retire on 15 years, not 15. Therefore, he has exceeded his yearly $180k salary cap and can begin to collect a pension of $20,000 per month after three additional five year period, at which time he should receive his first pay of $10,000 per month and then collect $80,000 per", "answer": "B: skyscraper"}

It will take 16 days of daily milking for the first calf to milk itself enough to make six gallons.   2)The second calf will only get eight milking because she needs to be introduced to milk. It will take 10 days for her to get her feet on, three days to get in the milk, and one day to pull the nipple.   3)There is a third young cow that will be milked twice daily also, so both cows can get a total of 10 lactation hours. This cow will take 16 days to milk herself, so that gives her 22 milking.  How many gallons of milk will the cows produce?\nOutput: The milk produced by the first cow and its three calves for the year totals to 70 gallons, which equates to $90.50\nThe milk produced by the second calf, two calves, and their mother equals 85 gallons, so that gives their two cows a total of 110 gallons for the year, which works out to $107.75\nThe milk produced by two calves plus the milk of its mother totals to 135 gallons.

If the boy were to watch TV at night, how many hours a day would he spend in the car? Please don\u2019t include TV time or screen time.\nOutput: 5 hours\nIf the boy spends 4 hours a day in a car seat, the 4 hours he\u2019s in the car will be divided evenly among the days. A car does not have 4 seats, therefore, the total number of hours the boy spends in the car will be 5/4 = <<5*4+4>>4 hours per day\nSince the 3 hours in each direction are spread evenly, therefore, the hours of the boy in the car will be spread evenly among 4 hours per day rather than evenly split among the days.  Therefore, the number of hours the boy spent in the car will be 0.5/1 = <<0.5*0.5=1>>1 hours per day.\nThus, the number of hours that he spends in the car is 0.5*0.05 = <<0.05*0.05=0>>0 hours per day.\nSo, the final answer is 0.05\n\nInput: When he is 15 years old the girl moves in with the family.

The wholesale price has dropped from $5.00 a gallon to approximately $4.30 for a gallon, and the retail price is about $3.32, or 50 cents per gallon.  Who is the source of this increase? Output: This answer is dependent on the gas price, if it was only a 15 cent increase on the national average the answer would be A; however, some areas have been hit with even larger increases.  The wholesale price of gasoline has increased due to the increase in the nation\u2019s gas tax.  Due to this, the wholesale price of gas has increased from 5 cents to 49 cents a gallon, and the Retail price of gas is now 3.33 cents per gallon.\nThe wholesale price of gasoline has also increased due to the decline in the price of the dollar.  Since the dollar has decreased, the cost of shipping goods is greater and therefore the cost of the gasoline.\nThe wholesale price rise was increased due to the increase of the crude oil price and the drop in the price of oil.  This is caused by the demand for crude oil by a major world manufacturer and the increasing prices of the natural gas that was used in the process.\n\nInput:James tells Mary that he is ready to buy a new bicycle.

The average woman runs at a pace which is 5:30/mile. She takes 5 hours to get to work each day. For every 20 miles the woman runs, the commute takes 9 minutes. If a man takes that same route twice in one day, would he run faster?\nInput: A man takes the same route 7 days in a row and walks 3.2 miles each day. He does the same distance one day but runs the same route only 5 times. In each case he burns about the same amount of calories, in miles, as each day's distance. The man gets the same end result, the same end speed, for each run. Thus he walks a total of 4.2 miles each day, so his walking times are 3 minutes each.\nOutput: A man's walking speed is 3 minutes each day, but his running time is 9 minutes each. Thus, since his running distance is 4.2 * 4.2 = 19.4 miles, a 40 mile run takes nine minutes, but because he ran 19.4 miles in 9 minutes his running time is 9.9 minutes, not 9 minutes. Given that, his running time is 9:10 = 9.9 minutes. If his running has to take 19.4 miles in a day, his workout is only 13:14, so it would take 19 times 19 = 397 minutes. That means he's been running for 6 hours.\nInput:Bert the elephant runs a mile every 18 hours. His pace", "answer": "B: entertainment"}

The lizards need the sun to perform their burning and absorption of heat.\nSo lizards require the sun to burn the earth for their heating needs.\nAnd lizards also need the sun to heat the air for their breathing needs.\nThus, the lizards consume earth by eating and burning it.\nThus, the lizard's diet is comprised of sun.

He plans to use the tractor for two additional years. Then he\u2019ll need to purchase a replacement tractor for $1,800.00. What does he need to do to pay for the purchase of a new tractor?\nOutput: A tractor that will consume 3.2 litres of oil daily (50 gallons) is needed\nSo the total purchase costs to replace the tractor and the engine that it uses is $1,800.02\nSo the total payment of $1,800.04 is equal to 4.9% of the $39,600 that he will earn by the end of 2000.\nSo the final payment, if he uses the tractor for 2 years and purchases a new tractor in 2000 for $2,800.00, will be $52 per month.\nSo the final monthly payments will be $52.\nWhich amount, in monthly payment, will result in a $52,000 advance on his 1999 income or will it result in a debt of $5,300 which will be paid in 3 years?\nOutput: The total payment resulting from paying off the mortgage loan will be $52 per $1,000 earned before making any monthly payments. So the total payment will be $52.02.\nSo the total payment will be: $52.02/1,000 (4.9%)\n= $26,750\nSo the total payment, if paid off immediately, will be $26,750 and it will be paid in three years.\nIf he pays the remaining $17,000, his 1999 income will be $48,000.00 before including any other income.\nSo the final total payment to pay off the mortgage will be: $48,000.94\nSo the total payment that will be paid off this year will take 1.8 years to pay off the mortgage loan. So the total payment for the year will result in a $28,000 gain.\nOutput: The total amount for this year will be $48,914.36\nSo the total payment this year will be: $28,000.\nSo the total loss that would come from not paying off the mortgage loan would be $29,", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

The average from 1980 to 2000 is much lower than the average of the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2032s.\nThis can be due to the country\u2019s overall population not growing at the same rate, but in any long-term averages there will be an overall dip in the life expectancy of the population over time.\nSo the average from 1980 to 2000 might have been 2.1 persons per 1000.  Now it is: 2.1 persons per 500\nSo the scenic route is the road that cuts through the country\n\nInput: The population in the United States is at a level where there are many more jobs, but fewer people are working.  The number of people working in the United States is very low.  Many people stay home, unemployed.  Why?\nOutput: The work force is not growing at the same percentage as the population.\nSince there are fewer jobs out there, more people are trying to find full-time jobs with benefits.  This results in a number of people trying to work part-time, minimum-wage jobs.  The result is that the rate of unemployment is higher than the long-term average.\nThus, the scenic road that cuts through the countryside is the road that is more attractive to people.\nIn this same graph the number of deaths is also at a very low level.\nThe number of people working is almost exactly the same in the U.S. versus China.\n\nInput: John and his wife are planning a trip to an ice skating rink.

Output: The driving range of a commuter is 5.25 hours a day. On a weekend the commuter will drive a 12-mile commute. On the weekend he or she is not driving at all. So the driver will drive a total of 12 miles. Thus, the mileage in a round trip commute on the weekends is 2*((5.25+12)*4)*2=7=25/1000 miles = 880 miles\nOutput: A: 5.25 hours B: 6.4 hours T: 14 miles, travel time is 2 hours for 12 miles or 7 min on the highway for 7 miles\nThe driving range on weekends is 4*((5.25*12)*4*2)*2=24 miles.\nSince there are 20 miles there is a total of 24*40=160 miles, in a round trip commute, or travel time.\nThus, the total mileage on weekends is 192*40=480 miles to/from work.\nThus, the mileage of a round trip commute on both Saturdays or Sundays is 192+480=960 miles to/from work for a total of 640 miles to/from work on the weekend.\nThus, the travel time on both weekends is a maximum of 480 miles.\nThus, the maximum driving distance is 640 miles.\nThus, there is no way the round trip distance is 880 miles for the commute times.\nThus, the commute time is 2.3 * 640= 16 miles, on each day. If the driver drives only a part of the day the commuting distance is 6.48 miles, or 16.08 miles a day.\nThus, the distance traveled on weekends is 6*640*16=72.42 miles.\nThus, it takes 72.42 miles to commute for 880 miles on any work day. Thus, the round trip commute is a loss of 32.84 miles.\nThus, since the commute time is 480/880 = 2 hours on average it takes 48 minutes to commute for 880 Miles.\nThus, the round trip commute loses a total of 96.54 minutes on average.\nThus, a round trip commute of 480 miles on Saturdays or Sundays for 880 miles to/from work takes 48", "answer": "E: row boat"}

Second, your mother is sick and very emotional.  What do you do?\nOutput: You tell your mother what happened.  You tell her the neighbor has been caught stealing and she feels very emotional.  You tell your mom you are going to return home and wash the dishes.\n\n The reason why that answer is not correct is that your mother would not be able to go home from town with both the washing of dishes and her feelings.  So she would have to go to the store first, then go to the neighbor, then go home.  After she had cooked a nice meal for herself and then her family, she would have to go back to town to the house before she could have a nice, calm evening at home and then she would cook dinner for everyone else.  This is the way she would do this most of the time.  For example, if it was raining then she would go to the store to get an umbrella.  Then she would go home and wash the dishes before she went to bed so that she would have time to cook dinner before she had to wake her family up to go to the store.  After she had made dinner, she would go back to the store and return home, and repeat this process until it was time for her to go to bed.  Since she would be tired and stressed from working so many hours, she could only spend about 5 hours a day at work at any given time.\nThe answer would be to wash the dishes first and then go to the store.\n\nInput:A woman is going to spend a day on the ocean shore and swim.

What equipment would they need to get started?\nOutput: They will need a tractor and at least 100 bags of hay to get started.\nHoney bee numbers in Maine are 2,600,000, so they will need at least 2,600,000 bags of hay\nIf they require 1000 bags to get started, using the average cost of a $1.00 bag of hay, they will need at least 1,750,000 gallons of water to water their farm-land\nTo take the total number of bags of water, they will need 100 gallons of water in 100 hours which equals about 4 days\nThus, they will need at most 1,750,000 litres of water in 100 hours in order to water their farm-hay.\nThis equates to 4 days per day to water the farm-hay. It will take at most 1,750 litres of water to water everything so for 4 days it will take at most 1000 litres of water to water the farm-land.\nThus, they will have enough water for at least 1 month\nSo if they have more than 10 days of dry weather it will take 1000 litres of water a day to water the farm\nSo their total water need is 1000 litres per day * 7 days a week for a month = 3,000 litres\nThey need 3,000 litres of water to water for 1 month. So they will be able to water the farm-lands for 3 months if they start cutting hay from today\nSo their total water usage is = 10 litres * 7 days a week * 3 months = 5,000 litres\nAnd therefore they will be able to cut their hay on the farm for 4 months without running out of water. So their land-water usage will not run out.\nThis is all assuming that the water use each day is less than 1,000 litres and the average yield from water use is 5 litres per man.\n\ninput: It sounds like there are lots of children in the audience.

They would then divide the amount of bread among the 30 people. However they will probably not divide it that way\u2014they will divide it by size of bread. That way each person will get a small piece and each person will contribute a piece\u2014some will take all of it and some will only take a small bite. Therefore they don\u2019t need to divide it so the employee who takes the smallest piece can get the most bread. The problem is that each person will probably take a small piece and put it in a bag. But this will spoil the bread very quickly. So for the employees who will receive the bread, the bakery should put out more bread so each person gets a piece.\nInput: Let\u201ds say you own a restaurant and you\u2019re giving away free meals to everyone.

The reason for this is that it is a sign of generosity to want to give money.\nIn English: You could be described as \"gifting\" when you buy gifts.

The house and house-equipment are rented at $600 for three months out of the year.  The rent is lower than the property tax value.  He pays $100 per week and pays $250 per year for a vacation rental.  He has a mortgage of $600.  Therefore the total annual rental revenue is $8,000.  Which of the following statements could be true?\nInput: He has a mortgage on the house ($500)\nOutput: The total annual rental revenue is equal to the sum of the annual mortgage ($500) and the annual rental revenue ($2,800).\nTherefore the total annual rental revenue equals the sum of the annual rental revenue ($1,600) and the annual rental expense ($2,800).  Thus, his annual rental expense equals the total annual rental revenue ($8,000) divided by the total annual rental revenue ($1,600), or $80.\nAlso, it\u2019s important to emphasize that all annual rental revenue is calculated monthly, regardless of season.  The monthly rental revenue is $800 divided by $800 per month = $600 per month.\nSo his monthly rental revenue is $500 divided by $600 per month = $400 per month.\nTherefore the monthly rental revenue is less than the annual rental expense ($1,600)\n\nInput: John lives in a cabin that he owns outright with his significant other.

To solve this problem, you order 100 gallons of shrimp from China.  Are you willing to pay $80,000 in shipping charges?  Are you willing to add $3,000 to the cost of the shrimp?  Do you think that your clients would still pay your increased charge?  (If they would still pay your increase, then why would you try to sell them shrimp that is not at your original price?)\nAnswer:\nThere would be no shipping charges added to the original price.  The shrimp would still be $40.00 as a retail product.  Each customer would still have paid $30,000 in initial and subsequent shipping charges, which would not be added to the shrimp\u2019s retail price.  Therefore, the original price of the shrimp would still amount to $40.00.\nTherefore, the final answer is $40\n\nInput: An average person who rents a car from a car rental agency would have to renew the car at least once a year.  A business person who wants to rent out his company\u2019s rented vehicle every day (for $250) would have to renew the rental every day at minimum.  Which one of these situations is more financially feasible?\nOutput:\nRe-renting the car each day is more financially viable.\nUsing the current $200 rate to purchase the vehicle and add $300 to this rate would make the cost per year $400.  If this rental rate were reduced to $200 per year, then the average cost per month would be $100.\nTherefore, the initial cost of the rental is $200/day and the total amount of monthly expense is $100\nThus, this company would not be able to make more than $80,000 in annual income assuming the use of every day rental cars.\nHowever, if the company\u2019s daily rental rates were $40 each day, the company could make $50,000 in annual income.\nThus, the car rental company would be able to make $250,000 per year.\n\nInput: When a company has a new employee, the person is trained in several different positions for 5 working days.

They want to keep the boy as the family's only child so that it will cost more money to raise the child.  Their cost is $1000 per year for child daycare.  Their annual salary is $50,000 each.  They would like to live off the money they earn from the child and their house will cost $400,000.  Is this even workable?\nOutput:\nNo, it is not workable.\nThe family will spend the $1000 and that would be $20000 per year\nSo each year their salary would be $20000.\nThey will therefore spend over $9,000 in child daycare\nSo their annual salary would not increase with the number of children they have\nSo this would need to be the highest salary of the two that they are living off of\nSo the salary would be $200,000*(200+9,000)/12 = $800,000\nSo it requires $800,000 in child day care expenses this year.\nIs that even workable? $3,200 in daycare expenses per child is a little cheaper than $800,000, but they can hardly live on $800,000.

There are 36 beds with beds for people who have died.  Which of the following statements will be true?\nOutput: The number of people who have died at the nursing home is 200.\nBecause there are 36 beds with beds each person who has died is allocated 20 beds.\nSince the total number of beds being used is 200, each 20 people who have passed away is allocated 10 beds.\nIn this example, only 10 people have died in a year, giving them 48 beds.\nThus, each of the 10 that have died in 2012 was allocated 10 beds.\nIt turns out, that since the nursing home does not have to house the dead, they could use the beds allocated to other people in the nursing home.\nTherefore, in this example, the number of beds being used in the nursing home is greater than the number of beds allocated to other people.\nSo the number of beds being allocated to other people is actually >200 since the number of beds being allotted to other people is greater than than the beds allocated to other peoples' dead bodies.\nSo the final solution is 200+200=<<200+200=200>>200\n\nInput: A child dies at the age of 1 and is buried in a cemetery.

Finally the two decided they had exhausted the possibilities of getting around, and went to a garage. They went in, and the owner brought out a car that was in perfect condition. When the woman asked where the mechanic was, the owner said that when she had chosen the car to drive, she had told him what she wanted, but he refused to change the oil. Finally, the husband and wife came out of the garage, and the mechanic said they had made a mistake. He explained that every major European automobile manufacturer provided their own mechanic service. He explained that he would replace the faulty oil filter that was causing the oil leak, and then give the woman a brand new oil filter, and he would give them an air compressor to change their tire.

The third pizza has two thirds the food in the second pizza, and the fourth has two thirds the food of the third pizza.  The fifth pizza has 2/3 the food of the fourth pizza, and so on.\nThus, the fourth pizza has about 3/4 the food of the third and fifth pizzas, so that is 2/3 the food in each pizza.\nEach individual has about 1/2 of the food in the second and third pizzas and 1/3 of the food in the fourth pizza.\nThus, the food totals about 2/3 of the food and is therefore 2/3 the food for the individual.\nThus, the total food for the individual does not equal 2/3, it is about 1/3 of the total food.\nThus, the final answer is one-quarter of the total food; the remaining food is either eaten before or after each individual is finished with the last dish.\nSo the final total food quantity is 1/2 of the total food quantity.\nSo the final average consumption is 1/2 of 2/3 of the total.\n\nOutput: In the case of Jason and Eric, it takes them 12 hours to drive one way to get the cattle into higher ground.

The journey can last several days, so we'll need 25 hours for the whole journey. The average speed of 30 miles per hour is 10 miles an hour. So the total drive time is 24 hours. Let's assume that we drive at 12 mph. Let's divide the time into 24/75 = 2.5 hours each way. So the total travel time will be 35 hours. Let's divide the total travel time into 25/75 = 12 hours per day, 75 minutes per day, or 75 minutes per hour = 45 hours per week for", "answer": "B: getting full"}

If the gas tank holds 15 gallons, how many gallons does the car use in a year?\nInput: The car's current fuel economy rating is 22 miles per gallon, but an efficiency gauge indicates that the car's fuel economy ratings are lower than that.  If the rating is lower than 22 mpg, how many miles is the car able to travel per gallon of gas and for how long with 50% fuel?\nOutput: 15 gallons per 100 miles = 0.17 miles per gallon\nIf the gas tank holds 15 gallon and 20% fuel, the car travels 0.17 mile per gallon for 16 miles.  If the tank holds 25 gallon and 35% fuel, the car travel 0.20 mile per gallon for 16 plus 2+2=2 miles\nThis works out to be 2 miles per 50% fuel\nSo the final answer does not add up to 50 gallons\n\nInput: Three gas pump operators are assigned to a work area.

One of them thinks that selling his house for $20,000 will boost the price, and then selling it for $20,000 to buy it will boost the price again. The other two think it is not worth doing both. Which of the following do you believe will work best?  Output: Each of the three should try selling their houses for $20,000 and buy the other house for $10,000\nTo increase the $20,000 to $10,000 ratio, John will buy the other house.  Then, John will transfer $20,000 to the other house.  He will then share this $20,000 to his partner, James, so that his partner buys the other house.  His share is not only $20,000 but $20,000 plus his $10,000, which also includes an additional $20,000, for the maximum $40,000 that can be purchased, because John and James want to share their house.  At the same time, John must give his share of $20,000 to James.  So there is $40,000 to be purchased, for a total of $60,000.00.\nAs well, his partners\u2019 share is calculated using a formula, so their share is in proportion to how much they invested in the process.

But that isn\u2019t what happened.  His house increased in value by $5,000.00 after selling it.  This increase was not caused by the $20,000 he sold his house for.  He had a large investment because he put $20,000 into it, but that investment did not increase its value more than $5,000.  Thus, it would not appear to have boosted the house next door\u2019s value.  Thus, the prediction will not work.\nJames\u2019 house did not increase in its value due to either of what he predicted", "answer": "C: progress"}

A car rental agency in Florida charges $110 per day for mileage. It costs $80 per day to travel to Orlando from Tampa, Florida. Eric wants to drive 5 hours to Orlando to rent a car for 5 days. How many miles of driving will cost him?\nOutputs: Jason will need 5*110/80=$440.00\nSince 5*110 is a unit of distance, since each mile in the car is 440, he will need $440.00 to drive 5 hours to the rental agency in Central Florida.\nFrom the total of $440.00 = 10+440 = 20+880 = 30+480 = 40+720 = 50+740 = > $520\nSo Eric will need $520 to drive 5 hours to Rent a Car in Florida.\nThis will also count as $520 to Travel To Orlando To Rent Car\n\nOutput: What is the highest amount that a man can borrow if he pays $80 per day to a $55 mortgage?\nInput: If the man borrows $55/month from his wife, then the amount of $80 = 10\u221255 = 10*55/60 = 40\u221250 = 15\u221260\nSince the total of 0*60=40+40+40+40 is 40, so $80 is 10* 60\nSo the man needs $40/60 = 20*60\nSo the final answer of 20+60 = 40*60\nInput: The man would like to buy a house for 60 years. How much land will the man need for a property he will buy?

The prescription calls for four pills daily for two weeks. The student is to take one pill and take it no more than six hours after dinner. How many pills might the student need to take?\nOutput: At six hours after dinner, a student has enough medication for five pills (five tablets). So it depends on the time at which a student takes the pills, how much medication they take and how many pills the student needs.\nThe number of pills a student would have to take depends on:  How long is the night?  How long is the student taking the pills?  How much time has passed since the student took the pills?\nEach time the time has passed since the pills have been taken, the student would need to take three pills (three pills if the pills are not taken the same time every day).\nEach pill the average student takes per day is 60 pills (60 tablets)\nOne tablet is 60 times 60 = 1200mg.\nThus, each tablet the average student takes each day is equivalent to 600mg.\nThus, at 600mg, the average student takes 6 pills (6 pills if the pills are taken the same time every night).\nThus, at 600 mg, the student takes 9 pills (9 pills if the pills are to be taken the same time every morning).\nThus, at 9 pills, the average student takes 11 pills (11 pills if the pills are due every two weeks).\nThus, 12 pills the average student takes per week\nThus, at 11 pills per week, the average student takes 15 pills (15 pills if the pills are scheduled every two weeks).\nEach pill the student takes per day is equivalent to 60 mg.\nThus, each time the student takes the pill, he takes 60 mg.\nThus the average student taking 60 mg per day takes 60mg x 6 = 1,060 mg every day\nThus the average student would need to take 2,360 mg\nThus, each time a student takes one pill and takes it for only one hour, his total amount of medication taken is equivalent to 2,360 mg\n(If the pills are to be used from morning until evening, it is", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

How much of that does one person pay for rent each month?\nOutput: This is not the ideal question since everyone pays a different amount per month, depending on the number of people in the home.\nThe total amount that every family member pays for rent would be $3090.  However, since that family member has a salary ($42,600), it is obvious how much salary person earns per month.\nThe salary person\u2019s share of rent is $210.  That means that a family member with salary has $3240 for rent and will pay $12.60 per month.\nSince each person has an income (salary) of $240, the total income of the family is $14,400.\nThus, someone is paying $60 for rent and everyone pays $30.\nThus, $60-30=<<60-30=180>>180\nThe total rent paid per month (180)*180=<<180*180=120>>120\nThus the final answer is 120\n\nInput: Two cousins own a farm which produces apples, oranges, and peanuts.

What should the buyer do with it?\nOutput:The car should be treated just as much as any other major item as a purchase of their life\u2019s most important purchase.\nFrom the car\u2019s total cost and the car being a purchase of someone\u2019s life\u2019s most valued possession, the car has a total of $19600.00.\nTotal vehicle cost after car loan is $1800.00.\nSince $1900.00 was spent on the car purchase, $4000.00 has been spent on the cars value.\nSo the car has cost him $4000.00 in total.\n\nInput:When a new car is purchased, it is financed to allow the buyer to make a large down payment with the least possible interest. How much does the buyer borrow?\nOutput: The buyer borrows $20,000.00.\n$2000 is borrowed for the down payment. $2000.00 is then spent on the interest.\nWith interest of this amount ($2000.00)/($20,000.00) = 2.35% = $3,400.00\nThe buyer is left with $3300.00.\nThus, the overall interest expense has been $4000.00.\nSo the net debt of the person is $3380.00.\nSo, when we consider the total amount of money out of which such a car was bought, $2000.00, and the $3000.00 he has in his possession of the money spent on the car, and subtract $2000.00 for $3280.00, that leaves $2340.00 which can be spent on other items.\nWith $2340.00 left, the person then has a net income of $2340.00.\nThus he can no longer afford the new car\u2026but what else?\n\nInput:We are considering moving to the desert.

Thus, there will be 11 full-time teachers on campus as compared to the 50 part-time teachers.\nSo there is 11/50, or 1%, of the students being taught by part-time teachers. Thus, with the full-time faculty there should be a teacher available to teach every 11th student.\nHowever, since there are 50 total students at the school, since each student is supposed to be taught by a teacher, that leaves only 8 teachers. Thus, with only 8 teachers at the school there will not be 11 teachers available for the students.\nThus, the teacher is only available for the students to get taught when there are 12+1=<<12+1=22>>22 full-time teachers.\nThus, the final answer is 22\n\nInput: If Sarah and Kevin are a married couple and have 2 boys and 1 girl, which one of them would have to pay for the family vacation?\nOutput: Sarah would pay for half of it.

A boar that weighs 2.3 tons can stand up for 6 hours without food, or 1.7 hours if it has been fed.  At least one boar weighs less than 1.5 tons, so it can stand for only 4 hours without food, or 3+1=<<3+1=3>>3 hours\nInput: How much can Sarah lift?\nOutput: The maximum weight Sarah can lift is 250 pounds, which is the weight of a baby boar\u2019s weight.\nTherefore, she can lift >250 lbs, 3*250 =<<3*250=1.5>>1.5\nOr, she can lift 1*250 =<<1*250=0.5>>0.5\n\nInput: The average length of a baby boar is 34 inches.

The infant will not reach 2.7 tons with the assistance of Sarah, but she can lift 250-150 pieces of furniture with her own hands.  The child will reach 2.7 tons of weight with weight support, or 2.7-0.5=<<2+0.5=4>>4\nOutput: The average age that Sarah can lift is 4.  In the time that it takes to lift an infant in a sling, Sarah can lift an infant up to 8 times her weight with her own hands (0.5*8=<<16+16=32>>32\nThus, her children will not need to be carried in a sling, even after baby Sarah is 6 or older\nThus, 4 is the answer.

However the closest courthouse was only 1 day away, and the nearest police station was 2 days away.  There was no hope.\nOutput: Jimmy was better off staying home.  The closest police station was 1 day away.\nThere wasn't hope. So Jimmy stayed home.  The nearest police station was 2 years away.\nTherefore, Jimmy was right back where he started.  The nearest police department was 10 years away.\nSo Jimmy stayed home.\nSo Jimmy's house was $100,000.00 below the selling price.  Therefore, since the house had been appraised for only $90,000, the house was only worth $50,000.  Jimmy was out $10,000,000.\nSo the final response is $10,000,001\n\nInput: A local government is in danger of losing hundreds of millions of dollars.

{"text": "Which building has all the glue bottles?\nThe answer should be E.\nThe first answer is B, but there are only 3 glue bottles inside, so the correct answer is A.\nInput: Why would it be a mistake to say that $200 is worth the effort when $50 is better?\nOutput: There are only three gluing devices in the room, so the final total cost per hour should be $50/hr.\nGiven all the gluing devices in the classroom, the total cost for the hour should be $150/hr.\nThus, $50/hour is more money than $200.\nTherefore, given all the glue bottles in the classroom, the final total cost for the hour is $150/hr.  Thus, $50/hr represents the more effective cost per hour over time.\nThus, $200/hr is more efficient over time.\nTherefore, it is more expensive to buy glue in a store than it is glue in the classroom.  Thus, the school\u2019s money spent for glue in a single hour represents a waste of money and represents an indirect loss.\n\nInput:The school receives a grant for a roof.

Therefore, $4450 represents the least efficient response for the grant.\nTherefore, $2250 represents the least efficient cost over time.\nThus the school had less money available than if they hired the second lowest bid for a roofing project.\nThus, at least the net result for the roof was lower.\nThus, the school could have gotten more.  We should think twice before hiring such a company.\n\nInput: What proportion of the school\u2019s budget should the teacher receive?\nOutput: Teacher\u2019s salary is only a small part of the school\u2019\nexpenditure budget.

Use this post once you have the answer to the previous question completed. Thank You!!\n\n1 Answer\n1\n\nIf the total price of renting a car is $400, you might rent a car for $200. The $200 doesn't have to be exactly $200. For example, if you rented a car for $200 on the first day of the week, and had a price in mind of $500 for that car for each of the 11 days, then you should be able to deduct around $250 from the $200 rent amount. The $250 that remains is supposed to be left over by the customer. At a minimum, you would then be left with around $100 as rent for each day. But that's only if you choose 10 days to rent a car. If you want to rent a car for 11 days, then 12 days will be needed. It might make more sense for you to rent for 7 days, then 7 times 11 = 14 days.\n\nBut if you didn't bother to calculate all of the above, then simply use $200 to calculate the total price to rent a car for the month. Then, subtract $200 from the remaining rent amount that day after you have your receipt for the car rental. For example, if your total cost to rent the car for that week was $200, divide $200 by 11 = $33. Take three times $33 and that's how much you would be getting for the rental of the car. If you decide to hire someone to rent a car for you, you would only be paying the rent of the car and not the other expenses, which can be high. Therefore, it is always a good idea to have a bit left over in order to pay other expenses incurred like gas, insurance, and maintenance.", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

If the lake becomes as dry as the ice in your refrigerator, the speed it will melt will be determined by the volume of water in the lake multiplied with the density of dry ice and multiplied by the temperature the lake will reach. What is the speed it will melt?\nAnswer: If the temperature of the lake reaches 45 degrees Celsius then it can be determined that the volume of water in it will be 200 kg/m2 and the density of dry ice will be 4 kg/m2. Then the lake will reach a speed of 450 m/s, and the volume of water will be 50 kg/m2 and thus the water in the lake will melt. Thus, the volume of the lake will drop by 40 kg (and thus will be dry) making the speed it will reach 450 m/s.

The mortgage on the house is $35,000 (the borrower pays 25%). The total loan balances is $150,000.00. The loan has a $14,500.00 interest rate. The house is rented to John and Mary for $1,500.00 per month. A total of $17,000.00 is paid to the lenders on the house, and $15,000.00 is deducted from the borrowers\u2019 monthly expenses. After paying $28,000.00 (10% of $17,000) in interest, the borrowers take out a $36,000.00 home equity loan from the lender (the loan is now 30% of $30,000), because their income is too low to afford the $14,500. 00 principal. John and Mary lose $8,500.00 of their $32,000.00 equity, because they have to buy the house from the lender, because they took on the loan, and because of their late payments. John and Mary lose about $38,500.00 of the $33,500.00 equity in the house. Finally, the borrowers sell the house back to the lender for $13,500.00, after they have paid off the principal. But after paying the $28,000. 00 interest, they still have only about $17,500.00 left in their home. And they have to borrow $18,500.00 from their father (the lenders take out a $14,500 loan) to make monthly payments on the house. So John and Mary now owe $54,000.00 (20% of $41,500.00) in mortgage debt. Their house now costs them $110,000.00 (40% of $45,500.00) to own.\nInput: What would be a fair price for the house to be sold for?\nOutput: The fair price for the house is $105,000.00\nAt $105,000. 00, the borrower is still left with $18,500 in loan debt.

The total balance in the account after 10 days is $2000. What happens when they both agree to put in $100?\nOutput: Now, the total balance in the account would be $2000/10 = $1000, which is twice what it was before. And Alice could use $250 to start saving. But, she doesn\u2019t want to take $250 from her savings account. So, she does not want to put $100 into the investment account.\nIn this situation the total balance of $500 is equal to the total amount of money in the account plus $100 from Bob.

In addition to taking care of their medical needs, Joe and his colleagues take care of their basic needs like food. Joe and the nurses each provide three food choices per week to a patient. Their total menu costs them about 1/5 of the total cost of medical care.\nWhich is correct?\nOutput: Joe offers food that cost $1.20 each and the patients pay $1.20 each, resulting in a total cost of $2.40\nSubtracting 20 from $2.40, the total food and medical services that Joe provides each week is $5.00\nThis is a great example of what food cost calculations can be done! If we had one patient only, all we would have to do is subtract the actual cost of the food from $5 x 10 = $18.40.\nSince the patients are paying $1.20 for each meal, subtract 20 from $18.40 to get 19.40.\nThis is a great exercise in food cost calculation. If we had only one patient, all we would have do is add $1.20 for 10 meals to get to the correct price!\nBut this is a great example of food cost determination. If we had 100 patients to care for, all we would have need to do is take the actual cost of food x 10 = $6.90 and add 20 to get $8.40!\nSubtracting the cost of each medical service gives us $8.40, so we have $8 x 10 = $18 which is correct!\n\nInput: A company owns two hotels.

According to the World Bank, the average number of hours worked each year in Brazil with a per capita income of only $0.053858 is 18 hours per workday or one workday for every 22.5 hours worked in the United States. How does this affect the average number of hours that a Brazilian citizen works each week?\nOutput: This country has a per capita income (adjusted for inflation) of $0.053747 per month. Thus, the average annual working hours for a Brazilian citizen at the median income of $0.030521 is 54.65 hours per week.\nThus, 54.65 hour week times 22.5 (i.e., two hours per month) = 537.65 hours.\nSo 54.65*22.5=537.65 hours.

This level of income is required for a family of four.\nAnd, since there is a $0.50 fee per week and a $1.00 per visit maximum, it takes $180/180 = $0.1787 per year to get food stamps. Thus the total income needed is $18,487.75 per year\nThe total number of recipients will be ~8 million in 2013.\nSo $18,487.05 + $90.55 = $27,937.09\nSo the total number of recipients for a family of four is ~2770\nSo $27,937 is the minimum required for the next four years. Therefore there is approximately 3 months of supplies to receive food stamps.\nOf this the 3 months of food stamp is ~3 months of food\nSo approximately 2770 months of food is needed to be purchased to get the 28 weeks of food stamps\nSo the total needed to purchase a food stamp is ~28,590 months of food\nWith $7,500 per month left after paying all bills and expenses, the 2770 months of food needed will be ~37,560 months\nThus the total need for food stamps is ~37,560 months over the next 30 years\nThe food stamp program is $2854", "answer": "C: opera"}

When he is alone, he plays with a finger picked guitar, when he is not alone he plays a mandolin which is a stringed instrument, or when he is not alone, he plays the banjo with his hands (but it requires a lot of skills to play the banjo well). When he is playing with his brother, he plays the guitar. While playing by himself, he plays a pick (a guitar pick), strums a guitar (a guitar style guitar), play the mandolin, or just plays the guitar. So it depends how you count people from 1.\nWhen he plays with the other people, they stand behind him as he plays the guitar.\nHe plays with the other people when he is alone.\nHe plays the mandolin when he is alone.

{"text": "A\n\nInput:Barry purchased a car for his family to drive. He wanted to share the car with one more person. He thought it would be useful for his wife to have the car.  The sales clerk agreed and suggested that he provide a car for a third person to use. So he offered $500.00 for a 2-seater car with an open seat for $1000.00.  The salesman accepted, but he recommended that James allow his wife to take the open seat.  James agreed to this as well.  When James said that he would take the open seat, he asked the salesman to put a cover on the seat.  The salesman did so and he asked if one could leave the air-conditioner on for the passenger.  The salesman then added $50.00 for the cost of setting up the cover, leaving James with an extra $200.00.\nAs Barry and his wife both agreed it would not be useful to only share the car with themselves, they both chose to do so together.  When the salesman called James to tell him about his extra $200.00, he asked him why he still wanted to do it with both of them.  James replied that Barry needed to know that he would not be left out.\nThe salesman asked Barry why he still wanted to go through all of this trouble only to find that he no longer wanted to do it.  Barry replied that he would do it again if he and his wife agreed to it.\nThe salesman concluded that the extra $200.00 would be worth it if the price difference between the two cars were worth at least twice as much.  With Barry\u2019s agreement that they would do it again, the salesman added $300.00 for the air-conditioner and $100.00 for a stereo system.  Thus Barry and his wife decided to each contribute $200.00 to the car.\nWhen James later asked why he no longer wanted to go through all the trouble, Barry replied that he was just trying to please his wife. He suggested that he find a better salesman in the future.  Since Barry has decided that all of this was unnecessary, he has no reason to do it again.\nSo James is no longer the owner of the car with more than two passengers.

You could also have offered coupons redeemable throughout the year. How much do you think the guests would have spent?\nOutput: If you give the guests free food you will get a $1,000 loss. You would have to give away food coupons in order to get back $1,000.\nYou could offer free food coupons, but each month you would need to pay someone to redeem the coupons for you. If a month passed without redeeming any coupons, you would have to pay for one year of food out of your own pocket. If you give away free food coupons and do not pay them out for the full 7 days, You'd lose about $350, maybe even more.\nBy giving them food coupons you could keep the value up and still make money on the rental. It would definitely help with your bottom line. For the second scenario, you would have to give away 5 free food coupons each month to bring you $800 in revenue. The $800 would bring you to $17,500 in revenue.\nYou may be able to keep some of that revenue if you give the guests food coupons that can be redeemed for cash.\nIf you give away free food, you will have to charge a small fee per meal. In this example you'd need to pay someone to give away free food for about 3$ so that gives you a little overhead. If you give the guests 1$ worth of food coupons that is worth 10 times less for 3$ you won't have to charge anything. $1 for each guest would be $30.00 so that would be 30$ for the whole year, which is", "answer": "E: gratitude"}

The buyer is interested and pays the $3,500 down payment. The asking price includes taxes, title, and the buyer's broker fee. If the buyer and the seller agree on an agreement, the buyer takes the $1,200 cash, the $1,200 down payment, the $200 broker fee, and the $1000 dealer fee to the seller. If the buyer and seller disagree, the buyer pays off the remaining amount of the $3,500. If the buyer and broker still believe that there is an agreement, the buyer deposits $1000 in cash and the seller takes the remaining $1,200 cash. If the buyer and buyer's broker still disagree, the buyer pays $500 in cash to the seller to deposit. That is called counter-offering. If you agree to counter-offer, you are agreeing to pay $500. If the buyer or the buyer's broker would rather the buyer buy your car for $1000 and keep the $500 from counter-offering, the buyer sends the seller $500. That makes the seller's counter-offering $500. If the seller and buyer agree on an agreement, they agree on a lower amount of the seller's offer for all of the above.

If the pen is only a pen holder for taking calls, he would place the pen on his desk.  If he is walking around with the pen in his pocket, he can carry it on his person.  The pen should not be carried in his pocket.

A business may be paid both a commission for selling a product and for promoting another product to the same client.  A salesperson does not get paid for every time they suggest to a client that a product or service is for sale.\n\nInput: A large commercial company has the option in their contract to add a new expense item every month if they so choose. They choose to allow this to be optional. If a salesperson buys a new phone for their office and then adds an expense item at the end of the month to that cost, how much does the salesperson make?\nOutput: The salesperson makes $1000 per month for just the cost of an expensive phone that he added to his monthly expense.\nSince the expense item was added at the end of the monthly expense, all of Steve\u2019s expenses that month were added as expenses totaling less than $1000.\nThus, the final answer is $1000.\n\nInput: On a cruise, a passenger has to leave on a shuttle bus, with a limited number of stops along the way.

Is there any way to replace the car?\nInput: The car being stolen has a history of accidents and is deemed \"unroadworthy\". The car is taken to the scrap metal depot to be sorted. The mechanic estimates that the car is worth $1000. Assuming he sells the scrap for $200, can he buy a loaner car for $200?\nOutput: The car being taken to the scrap metal depots is valued at $1000. Since there are no damages, the mechanic cannot buy the car.\nConclusion: The mechanic can buy loaner cars for $200.\nExample: The car is $1000, and the total of all loaner cars is $2000. Assume the car is sold for a quarter of that (4x200), paying $500 for the loaner car.   So the total of the scrap minus the loaner = $2000.\nAfter subtracting $500, we get $1000 and therefore the mechanic is in the same situation as the previous example.\nExample: The total cost over 12 years of loan and the car cost $2000. Assume that the loan is paid off and the car $2000. So for a total of $2000 over 12 years, the mechanic has only earned $200, and does not have $2000 to buy another car.\n\nInput: A person buys a rental van for $900.

They pay $450 each for flights and $450 to check into hotels.  The maximum cost per day is $1,700.

For example, the resort does not charge for the room, the resort does not require a reservation, and the resort does not charge $50 per person per day to check into the hotels in addition to the per person per day to pay for the hotels.\n\nInput:Suppose that John buys a $1,000 watch.

To see the rental fee that the customer pays, the customer must pay for one trip. The agency does not give other forms of payment to a second trip, therefore the $30 fee is paid directly to the customer. There is no charge for the initial rental.\n\nSolution\n\n1. The car rental fee is the rental fee ($30) of the agency.\n\n2. The customer must pay for only one trip ($30).\n\n3. Therefore you must have $30 paid toward the car before driving. Therefore, as stated above, the rental fee should be paid for in advance of driving.\n\n4.

If the rancher has enough animals, he is willing to let the son drive his vehicle to deliver the animals to higher ground. If not, the son will walk the cattle to higher ground. How far will each person walk the cattle? Which method is easiest?\nOutput: Given that there are four people involved in the operation, the total amount of time will be 24 hours and 40 minutes\nGiven that each person will walk the cattle 24 hours each day for 40 minutes each day is the total time to be 24 hours? = 24/40 = 2.08 minutes\nSo the total amount of time spent for the operation will be 24 hours/2*40 = 2*2\nSo the final answer has been 2 hours 15 minutes\n\nInput:The car-rental agency bills the car owner $150 a day for a 7-day rental.

If she has more than one fever, her higher fever isn\u2019t as bad but because it\u2019s a fever and you can have one, you\u2019ll get more sick from it.\nSo either she has an a fever and isn\u2019t showing symptoms, or she has a fever and is showing symptoms but they aren\u2019t as bad, so if she has a fever and you don\u2019t tell her to stay away from you, you\u2019ll probably get better faster than you think.\nSo she is in extreme pain but is her fever high enough that it\u2019s showing on her temperature.\nSo she has an higher temperature than normal, so to make up for it, she has a fever for awhile and she\u2019s in pain.\nSo either she had an extreme temperature and isn\u2019t sick enough to tell you, or she already caught something and is sick enough you can tell she isn\u2019t sick and doesn\u2019t need to be around you.\nSo the fever is high enough it\u2019s affecting her, but it\u2019s not severe enough she\u2019s out of your way, so it can wait until you\u2019re better.\nSo the fever has to be strong enough to make up for everything else, if not, she doesn\u2019t need you to worry about it.\nSo the higher the fever is, the smaller your concern should be.\nNow if she has an extreme temperature and you don\u2019ten\u2019t feel comfortable around her, don\u2019t tell me and just keep the thermometer where you\u2019re comfortable and let me know when she gets low.\nThat\u2019s just me, and I don\u2019t want to be mean about that, but I think it\u2019s a good rule of thumb.\nHow high can the pain be?

The men responded by taking their guns and starting shooting at the girls.  When the man in the dream woke up he had given his wife money so that she could take the children with her to their mother\u2019s house and hide them. However, she put all his money into her savings account because \u201cYou can\u2019t trust anyone\u201d.\nThus, after the dream, the man was angry with himself for being irresponsible and for not protecting his family.\nThus the man feels like it is the mother\u2019s fault, not the children\u2019s. In this example, the two words A and C are inversed.\nThus, A: you can\u2019t trust people B: you don\u2019t trust mothers C: you should have put your money away more\nThe final answer is 53\n\nInput:The father has a dream when the boys were young.

If it snowed 5 feet a day over a year, the car will be safe from the snow.\nTread depth means that if a car is driven in snow for 6 months straight it will not have problems from the snow.\nThe tread depth of the tire is the depth at which the tread meets the ground.\nSuppose 10 tons of snow is dropped on the tires over 4 months. The tread of the tires will be 9/16 inch deep.\nSo, if she is driving the car 4 million miles, the tread of the tires will have worn down to just 9/16 inch.\nSo, the final answer is 9/16 inches.\n\nInput: There are three cars on the driveway.

The house is valued at $500,000 and he wants to buy a cottage on the same property. What is the maximum house price that the cottage could sell for?\nInput: The property is valued at $500.000 and is worth a downpayment of 10%.  Thus it could sell for $480,000 or $480,000+200 = $480,000\nA $4,200 downpayment on a $480,000 house would equal $96,500, and $96,500 divided by 10 times $480,000 would equal $19,500.\nThus, $19,500 divided by $480,000 yields $19,500 divided...\nIt is very likely that the house can sell for $4,200 to $4,500. However, a $4,200 house can also sell for $80,000 to $120,000. The value of the cottage itself can also be $40,000 to $80,000.

What is the most expensive type of home that the couple can put up on their property and what is the most expensive type for which that could be built?\nOutput: A $20,000 house for $5,000 would be worth $80,000 for a couple\nAn $80,000 home for $5,000 in a $500,000 house would be worth $160,000 for a couple.\nNote: Using $500,000 as a starting point, $160,000 is $19,500. Thus, a $20,000 home for $20,000 would only net $1,170 compared to the $580 one would need to invest in buying a $160,000 home.

This will allow the employees to complete their work during their unpaid leave.\nAssuming each of the positions requires 10 different skills, each employee will expect to take 2 weeks to gain a level of proficiency in each skill, thus requiring each employee to take 3*3=<<3+3>>2 weeks to gain a skill level. So the total time it will take the employees to learn all 10 skills is 27*3=<<27+3>>3 weeks.

What is the average number of eggs hatched per incubation day?\nOutput: The average number of eggs hatched for every incubation day is 20.\nSince the average number of eggs for every incubation day (assuming a 40 day cycle) is 20, the total amount of eggs hatched per incubator day is 20*40+10=35\nTo calculate the average number of eggs per incubation day: 50x10=>>50x10=75\nSo the final answer must be 75*60=<<75*60=180>>180\nFrom the initial value of 180, 60*180=<<60*180=225>>225 which leaves 150\n\nInput: There are 10 sheep in a flock. One sheep dies from a broken leg. Two sheep are killed by being hit by a truck. One sheep is hit by a car and dies. What is the average flock size?\nOutput: The flock size is 10/10.*100.*5.\nIf the average number of sheep killed per day per animal was 5, so that means the average sheep per animal killed per day per animal would be 5*10*100*5=20.\nThus, the average flock size is 20*40+5+5*12=60\nSo the final answer was 60\n\nInput: There is a new apartment building in a suburban area of New York.

Output: 40 MPH.  The car was moving at:  50 MPH.  How much effort it took to complete a full lap at 100 MPH?\nOutput: It took 40 minutes.  The average speed was 25 MPH.  So the average time to complete a full lap was:  25 + 35 + 45 + 95 = 105.  The average car speed was:\n75/4*100=25 MPH.  The average time to complete a lap was 25/4*25/4x40 = 125.

The price of the tools is $500 each.  The price of this house is $250 per month.\nAfter a month, the father sells another set of tools, a lawn irrigation set, to another family that lives with their grandparents.  They wanted the lawn irrigation and tools.  Would he try to sell the lawn irrigation and tools for $500?  What is the best offer he could receive?\nOutput: If the money was worth $500, then he would consider making the offer $500.\nNow the lawn irrigation and tools total $3000.  This equals $2500 per month = $2500/3 = $5,000\nTherefore, he is able to sell the lawn irrigation set for $2500.\nAnd he gets the lawn irrigation and lawn tools for $2500.\nThe total is $2500 * 3 = $6,250\nThe house was priced at $250 per month.  The lawn irrigation and lawn tools can buy it for $250 a month.  Therefore, the total of $2500 * 3 = ~$7,500\nThe total amount of his purchase of the lawn irrigation and lawn lawn tools includes the price of the lawn irrigation and the lawn lawn tools.\nIf you buy a $1000 lawn irrigation system, it would cost $5,000.00.  Therefore, the price of your lawn irrigation system includes the cost of $5,000.\nAs a result, you get a lawn irrigation system for $2500.  However, your total is $3450.\nSo the total is $2500 * 5 = $3685.\nThe lawn irrigation and lawn lawn were $3,500 per month when they were sold.  The house was $250 per month. After a month of use and some wear and tear, the lawn irrigation is worth $5,000.  Therefore, your total would be $3695 * 5 = $40,475.\nSo the total of the lawn irrigation and grass lawn is $50,475.\nAnd the house that the husband bought was worth $250 per month. That means he got a house for $650 a month. Therefore, his total of $650 * 5 = $1200.\nIf you buy an electric lawnmower for $100 per month, it will take you 3 months", "answer": "C: say goodbye"}

In addition, this customer also provides the wife and mother of the woman with cash every week so that they can use half of the time and not have to worry about how the woman is going to pay the bills. As a result, the woman\u2019s new salary was $400/day plus $100 in gas money each month.\nOutput: The woman spends $400 per day, totaling $1260 each week.\nEach work week, for 2 weeks, she would have $1200. This total adds up to $1200 per month. So the final total of the woman's expenses are $1200/month.\nHow much is $1200/month, in cash, after the first 2 weeks if purchased at a grocery store in the supermarket?\n\nInput:  A new construction home is built in a subdivision.

What is the relationship between a supply and demand?\nOutput:Supply and demand are the same term for people and products.\nThe supply and demand in the game of baseball represents the number of people that could hit a ball.\nThis is like the supply and demand in the marketplace.\nIf there are more people playing the game of baseball, there should be more balls.\nThis is the relationship between demand and supply.\nIf there are far more people playing the game, there are far more people who will attend the game.\nAlso, there are far more games of baseball to go around so there should be many more tickets that need to go around.\nIf demand is greater than supply, more people will buy tickets.\nIf supply is greater than demand, the supply is likely going to keep going down because most people who can afford it can afford it.\nAnd this is true when the people and objects are more scarce and when the supply of goods and services are decreasing.\nSo all these factors together create a greater need for a new product or supply chain.\nAnd with these new supply chains, there is a greater opportunity for a product or supply chain to grow and prosper.\nSo in the end when supply and demand match, there is more opportunity for new products, new suppliers, new buyers, new business, and a greater supply of goods and services.\n\nInput:John has a restaurant.

The number of items that fit in your hand is 60 + 30 = 72\nOutputs:A cupboard is 4x4x10 \u2013 (4x4x10) + 10 + 30 = 36\nOutputs:Chocolate has 44g of sugar. So each child has 44g of sugar every day. Coffee has 60g of sugar. Candy bar has 25g of sugar. Soda Pop has 35g of sugar. So, each child has 1.2g of sugar per day. So, each child consumes 1.2g of syrup every day. So, each day each child has 45g of syrup in their body. Each day, the child consumes 36g of sugar. So the syrup comes back to the parent as 45g of sugar every day \u2013 which equates to 36g of sugar per child. Which of the sugar syrup is greater than 45g of sugar in each child? Which is greater than 18g of sugar per child? Which requires less sugar to be ingested? Which has the same sugar content per child? Which has less sugar than 45g of sugar per child that child eats?\nOutput:It turns out that if the child consumes 60g of sugar per day, then it will only release 45g of sugar by going through all the parts of the system in the human body. It will release all 45g of sugar by taking sugar from its stomach, throat, tongue or throat, and using it to power the rest of the body. If the child consumes 50g of sugar, it will release 50g of sugar. Since the child has to pay for the cupboard and chocolate each day, a child will consume 50g of sugar per day on average.\nInput: If someone has to go out for a day to work, how does the", "answer": "D: candy bar"}

He has a single seat and a chair for each passenger, the total amount of seats would be 90. How far will the astronaut stretch the legs/wings of his spaceship?\nOutput:To fly to Mars in an hour he will need to stretch the legs of his spaceship an equal amount. Since he will be flying in space for 8 hours, his spaceship will need to be stretched an equal amount for 8 hours.\nAssuming a length of 10 meters, the astronauts legs would be stretched an equal amount of 4 meters.\nThe length of each arm will be equal to the length of the seat\u2019s elbow.\nThe length of legs will be equal to the distance between the seat\u2019s feet and the passenger\u2019s feet.\nThe distance between the legs will be equal to half the distance between the seat and the feet of the passenger.\nIf he has 5 passengers, his arm length will be equal to the total seats, his legs would be equal to the seats, his arms would not be stretched.\nThus, the total length of the astronaut in the spaceship would have a length of 50 meters\nThis equation yields a length of 100 meters\n\nInput: A boy wanted to know what his father said, what did he say?

So he plans to plant 20 acres of wheat (1 acre of seed per year) by planting it first, then irrigate the remaining 40 acres as needed.  The farmer thinks that this idea is a good one but he can improve the irrigation plan by selling off the first part of the farm to a contractor.  So the farmer decides to sell off 10 acres of the farm in three years.  Can he buy back the 10 acres of land after the first 10 years of selling it at a much lower price?  He decides no, and he decides to plant 20 acres of the 70 acres that the contractor wants to buy for $2,000 per acre.  What will the farmer receive for the 10 acres of land?  Or does he have to start the 30 year period all over again after this 10 year period?\nOutput: After 30 years the farmer will receive $4,000 per acre.\n\nInput: A dog is tied up outside a farm house.

C: If it doesn\u2019t get in between them, they won\u2019t be hurt. D: If one of them gets it in the eye or mouth, they will need immediate removal.\nOutput: If they get sand under either one of them, they will need immediate emergency attention or they will end up stuck in the sandbox and will need to be pulled out.\nAnd here, I meant to say if one or both get sand up their noses or mouths they will have trouble breathing. So this statement was probably just incorrect.\n\nInput: How many days does it take for a farmer to feed one horse?\nOutput: If you get a bad haircut, it\u2019s only one hair cut worth of feed.\nSo it takes one haircut worth of feed to feed each horse for a week.\n\nInput: At this stage of the game, your teammate needs a break.

If I had a child and would invite 10 boys only, then the room with 20 boys will contain 50 people.\nSince there are a number of parents and their friends in the room with the young lad, so many more people are likely to be admitted than if it were a larger room.\nSo the final number will be: 50 plus 10 = <<50+10=60>>60\nThus, 20*60>>60 = <<20*60+30>>30\nSo the final answer has to be: 60\n\nInput: The family has hired an outside plumber to fix the leaky pipe in the bathroom.

How many \u201cdays\u201d does it take to eat this fruit?\nOutput: The boys and girls eat 1.5 times as many days as the number of days given in the question. At the end of the year, the students eat 1.5*90 = 50% of the days given. So each year, at the end of their grade, the boys eat 50/90**80 = 25% of the days given to them.\nSo the final number of fruit picked by the boys and girls is 25*90/90 = 200/90 = 45 days during the year\n\nInput:At the start of the year, each student picks out something for his/her teacher. Does that something have to do only with the teacher who is the subject of the year's report? For the same purpose, pick out 10 things to give him/her at the end of the year.\nOutput: Each week (for teachers, and for students) has a different theme. For teacher\u2019s week, students give their teacher 5 things. For student\u2019s week, the teacher gives 10 things to the student\u2019s.\nSo after 5 weeks, each student ate 45/70*10 = 60% of the days given by them to the teacher.\nSo the number of days eaten by each student with respect to the teacher is 60/70*10 = 270/135 = 105 days\nSo the final answer of 270 is 105\n\nInput:At a school, there are 7 boys and 10 girls, and the entire school has a population of 350 students.

During the night, when there are several people visiting, the refrigerator is heated by two fireplaces and the air vents warm it by one fan. The total cost of heating, over the course of a day, is $100.00. If the cost of hot water is excluded from the total, what is the final total?\nOutput: $100.00 * 2 x 25 = $360.00 * 60 = $480.00 -- not including utilities\nSo the total cost is $480.00\n\nInput: How many people are in the family? If a room requires two beds, how many people may the room hold? The number of guests will be the number of people in the family divided by three (the number of occupants of the family). Each room can hold four people.\nOutput: Eight people can be comfortably accommodated in each room.\nIf two beds are required, each room can hold two. If a room is double, it may be able to take up to four people. Two adults and one child per room equals the number of people the room can accommodate.\nIf all rooms are double, the number of occupants is eight.\nIf a room includes a kitchen and bath, the number of occupants can easily be quadruple if additional dining room space is included.\nIf a room is equipped with televisions and multiple computers, it may be able carry eight additional people.

As a child she was raised in poverty, and knows first-hand how important food is to those with little. Therefore, she chose to give the money to those who need it most. She wanted to send the message that food is an important part of life for everyone, and it is possible to use money in different ways. Her son was not asked to answer his own question, and he did not get to see how hard his family's situation was, by spending his allowance.

What can they do to rebuild a new house from the frame up to the outside?\nOutput: They must build a new house from the floor up and finish the outside.\nSince the frame is the outermost part of the new house, the women must build a new house with the frame in the beginning so that the men can complete building the outside.\nEach house must be finished before it can be moved to the next phase since the next phase is to complete the outside.\nThis is why the process is to build a new house from an empty piece of lumber.  The frame of the new house must be laid for the floor and the frame of the new house built so that there can be continuous layers of wood until the last house can be built.\nSince there is only so much wood that can be laid on the earth, the women must build the last part of the house until there is a single piece of wood for the ground.\nThen the men will continue the construction of the next house and the women will complete the construction of the next one so that everyone gets finished building their house.\nThe last house must be completed because it is the final step before the first house construction.\nSo in the case of home repair, the man and woman are both responsible for constructing the first house, and at the end the man completes the final house.\nSo in the final answer, the man and woman have completed the complete construction.

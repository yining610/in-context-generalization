John never said 'Why?' in class.  Therefore, John cannot be 'right' for the entire class.

It's basically saying, "John, take a moment, think about each of the three answers and how you would respond to each."<n><n>If this seems difficult or it has seemed difficult in the past for other groups, it's probably because our brains are trained to make decisions quickly.

Then it took me 5 pages to write 4 labels for all the 11+ pages, and another 5 pages to write the same labels on one page.<n><n>I am not asking whether or not I can do that efficiently, I'm just impressed at how many pages someone put stickers on.  I guess I just have too few sticky bits :)<n><n>Thank You, I'm going to ask all the kids at my school to answer the same question.<n><n>-Jimbo<n><n>PS:  How can we solve the riddle together?<n><n>I have a friend, Michael, who has the same problem as you. I suggest the following:<n>1. Have yourself a chat with Michael and tell him to make as many labels as he wants and put all of them on the same piece of paper and fill in the spaces with your own sticky notes and put the other piece of paper in a ziploc bag and take them to school with him so he can print out his labels, but only as long as there are stickers on your friend's paper. That would put all the stickers on the paper into your pocket at the same time. So you would at least have the paper of several of your friends to play with.<n><n>2. Your friend would have to make a total of 8 labels. Each label could have 4 stickers on it, and you could fill in the gaps with your sticky notes as he does his.<n><n>3. If Michael's answer is correct, then we are all going to get stuck this year with the answer of what to do with the 6th and last sticker, but neither you or Michael ever knew the answer either. In other words, in all likelihood the same problem will occur as you were looking for. So my suggestion is to just ask the teacher. Just tell her that last year she never answered your question. I'm sure she won't. You might be in for trouble if you try it yourself, but I think that it might be worth the risk :)<n><n>You can always see whether what my friend did worked<n><n>PS: If you like doing this, there is also a book series by Scott and Maryanne called "Make This Book" that is

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:The priest pushed for more orthodox behavior, what kind of behavior was he trying to stop? Choices:  A: liberal B: heretical C: recalcitrant D: conservadox E: heretical<n>Output:		 The priest removed the large sticker from the front and the smaller sticker from the back page of his book. He then removed the stickers on the 6 other pages of the book. He also removed his large sticker from the front page of his book.<n>Output: The priest added a total of 6 stickers/page * 6 books= <<6+6=48>>48 stickers to his book. Since he started with 48 stickers, he now has 48 - 48 = <<48-48=44 >>44 stickers left.<n>Since he started with 69 stickers, he now has 69 + 44 = <<69+(44)=45>>45 stickers left.<n>Since his book has 90 stickers, he now has 90 - 90 = <<90+90=39>>39 stickers left.<n>Since the priest started with 1 sticker, he now has 1 + 1 = 2 stickers left.<n>Since Mary has 89 stickers, the priest then removed 89 smaller stickers and added 87 more stickers to her journal. Since Mary started with 89 stickers, the priest now has 89 - 89 = <<89 - 89=35 >>35 stickers left.<n>Since 1 sticker left is 4 stickers, therefore the total amount of items left is 4.<n>In total, the priest added 6 stickers/page * 8 books= <<56+4=64>>64 stickers to his book. From this total, he added 3 small stickers and 45 medium stickers to his book. He also added an extra medium sticker to Mary's book.<n>To get the final answer to “Input: ”, “Output: ”, "Assigned Value" and "Exam", subtract the amount of stickers added to either side by the amount of stickers removed from both sides of either sheet. This is simply a generalization of the standard “divide all by 9 to get the number of stickers" formula. Remember to divide the numerator and denominator to get the final number.<n><n>Input: How many stickers does Mary see in her stack of paper? Output: How many stickers have been removed from the stack of paper?<n>In total, Mary saw 8 stickers.<n>Since 8 stickers were not removed from the stack of papers, Mary's total number of stickers is 10.<n>Since 8 stickers remain, her total number of stickers now equals 25.<n>Since 25 is not a zero, it therefore equals 15.<n><n>Input:When will Mary stop pushing back at her sister? Output: Will Mary continue to push back at her sister?<n>In total

Choose the answer that best fits your answer to the previous question.<n>Output: A full moon is a full moon.  If the moon is not full, then it would not be a full moon.  A new moon would therefore be a new moon because it is not "perfect."  A half moon would be half an entire moon and thus not a full but it would not be a half moon because it would not be perfect.  A third full moon would be the full moon but only because the third full moon was not "perfect."

He also apologized for being a jerk earlier (he couldn't remember her name), and asked her if she was his friend or not.  She said he was and he asked her to call him Jay; she did.  He asked to see her notes, and gave her 4 notes.  He wanted to hear her answer to the date.  She told him of her date and his idea to go back to the library to talk.  He then told her he had no idea what he had said wrong earlier, and apologized again.<n><n>### Answer: D, answer should be something like A.  "Shy" means that Mary was too scared to say exactly what she wanted, so she told him her thoughts on the date.<n>### Explanation:Mary felt nervous because she was thinking so much about the letter that she didn't think to ask about the date (date, letters, etc) on her date with James.  Since she didn't ask about the date on the previous date, and it didn't mean much to her because of it, she assumed that it must not mean much to him either.  She didn't want to seem too much like a needy person, so she told him she was having a really bad day and not really comfortable meeting him, so she came along with Jay, her friend.<n>### Question: If she had not said anything about the date, how might she have presented herself?

The answer:  A: the length of the tail C: the circumference of a circle D: the length of the body  The question: Why is the length of the tail long<n>Output:The tail is long.<n>Suppose X, Y and Z are circles that all have equal lengths.<n>Let's draw a rectangle on their center and call it "A".<n>Then X = (1 + a) - 1 = aa.<n>Then the length of the tail of C is equal to the length of A.<n>Therefore it is easy to connect the length of the tail with the length of A.  This is called the equation.  When you have more circles and a longer tail, the equation is easier to solve.  When the tail is a long distance from the center of the circle, the equation is easier when you have a long or a short tail but still less when you have a long tail.

First is that I got this question right away for the first time ever. I've been teaching this lesson for 3 yrs straight. I'm so relieved, haha.<n><n>I was working on a game unit with my pre-K kids. I asked about this game's packaging, asking students to look at the front page of the game and the back page. It was a big group of students and by the time I asked the question, I was overwhelmed with the answers because they were all on the same page. I wanted to get a second opinion, and I did.<n>I asked him to read the instruction booklet, which was on that page. Then I asked his student to read the instruction booklet and I got the same answer. He did it again and said he didn't see anything out of the ordinary. He knew exactly what you meant. This is the problem with teaching kids. You have to have second opinions, and this time I heard it. I took notes and shared this study with our teacher council member who asked if it was a common thing. The consensus was that it was. I wanted this lesson to be about packaging, since the book says it is a review of what the kid is going to buy. This means that the kids would have to buy it themselves. When you are teaching a lesson about the packing process, it doesn't matter if kids know what they are going to buy or not. It is their homework, and they have to do it.<n><n>I think that the book isn't a perfect example of how packaging is done, because the packers don't have to add the stickers all the time, they can use glue sticks instead. This question also goes back to packaging for toys. In a box, it's good because a kid already knows what they are going to get. In a bag, you have to put the sticker on your fridge, so it's harder to say that a kid knows what they are getting. If you are going to do a review of a unit, you want to have people look at the lesson and the products first. Having kids buy the items is easy (assuming you aren't teaching kids to buy something for the first time), but having all the stickers around it makes it seem more involved. It would be just as interesting either way, but if a

Choices:  A: build family together B: fall in love C: make love D: complete E: distance themselves<n>Output:		He would buy a dog to cuddle with and spend time with her.  If he wasn't a bachelor he would also visit her, maybe even move in with her.  Her brother would write her letters every month asking her how things were for him.<n><n>Assignment:<n>To solve the assignment, I had to look at the information I had about this couple in order to deduce what their personal relationship might be. As students, some of us might have been influenced by our parents, so I'm looking at their history together and their attitudes towards family to try to find things they could have in common.<n><n>1. Their history together<n><n>In the short relationship history, it's clear that their age isn't an obstacle. As their son was three when they were together, their relationship has probably been going on for a while. They lived together (though separated) for quite a while (5 years). Their son was one when they were together. She was the one who supported him as he adjusted to a new family. When he moved out, she still supported him. It's clear she is the one who instilled morals, morals that he still practices.<n><n>2. What was the main event in this couple's recent lives?<n>From the information I had, the most recent event in her life was starting her job. Her son was starting kindergarten. Her brother was entering his first year of university. While they did date back during their marriage, they lived in separate states for many years after their marriage. He lived in Colorado and she lived in Virginia. They met at the beginning of the decade but their relationships didn't go far beyond this. In addition, she didn't write very often, rarely if ever sent a postcard home for her brother. She never wrote him more than what she sent him home for meals. Perhaps the most major event that I can think of was when she started her job. This is probably the only time she really put much thought into how to treat her son, because there wasn't much of a difference between the two of them.<n><n>3. How and why are they similar?<n>Since she had the longest (10 years) relationship, they have both always had high standards for themselves. She would make plans that the rest weren't happy with. Her son is the same way. If the rest of the family was upset with the dinner plans, she would just let the rest decide when he came to dinner. Her brother, on the other hand, would push

Judy served two terms as a school board member.  During each two year term Judy held a position on the school board.  At the time of the election of Judy as a school board member, she was a member of the high school class, age 14.  As a high school student Judy was also on the school's newspaper and art staffs.  During Judy's first few years on the school board, she held several positions on the school board. During her final year on the school board (age 17) Judy was appointed as the new president (and class secretary) of the high school's student council.<n>In the summer of 1998 Judy was a member of an organization called "Sugar Creek Seniors."  Judy and her friends formed this organization and organized a few fundraising events around campus.  Judy also volunteered for various other organizations in town.<n>During the time Judy was a member of that organization, there was also a group of teenagers named "The Bullys."  One of that group's members later challenged Judy to a fight in the parking lot of a local convenience store.  During this event, Judy ended up with a broken nose, as well as multiple other facial lacerations.  While Judy spent several days in the hospital, the Bullys continued to meet.  They continued to be active members of the school's student body, as well as members of the local organization.  The Bullys eventually stopped meeting, because the members and organizers were too traumatized by what happened to Judy to continue meeting.  Judy's physical injuries from the fight remained a source of emotional frustration and anger for her, during and after the incident with the Bullys.<n>While looking through this scrapbook last night, I found a few memories of an incident from my high school days.  I decided to write a review of some of the highlights of my high school experience, with the goal of creating some sort of a chronological record of my high school years.  This also happens to be a record of the first time I ever made a "snarky" joke.  It did become a source of great amusement to me to see how often I had to repeat my use of that word, as a "snarky comment."  I was still trying to be "cool" in my social classes, but my social

The child will learn new things from writing but illiterate is not an answer.<n><n>In our class we started with how to answer the question on page 29 of the book with the teacher's example.<n><n>Answer: "We don't have to worry about numbers the same way we might for words. Numbers come from somewhere, and each letter of the alphabet has a different number of digits."<n><n>Our answer seems right to me, but I can't quite get it. Can you help?<n><n>Answer: I decided to do a follow up research session to see if anyone was able to spot this from first glance, but still get the correct answer and so my answer has been altered.<n><n>I read it a few times without noticing, and then the answer came to me. The question was:<n><n>We don't have to worrying about numbers the same way that we might for words, and each letter of our alphabet has a different number.<n><n>Answer: I guess my answer is that words are all numbers. You can't start a word with a capital letter and then spell it. Words are made up of numbers (a-z). In the story we have started, the numbers are even.<n><n>My response to this would be no not really, because you can start a word with a lowercase letter and then spell it, and the word becomes a number. Words are made up from numbers.<n><n>Answer: The only difference I can think of between how numbers and letters are used, is that the number for the last word in the sentence was omitted in the title. The title would be something like "John" so "john" should be number 2, but he had number 2 omitted. Therefore he is illiterate and cannot write. As you said, he will learn more than knowing how to write.<n><n>So we decided that he is illiterate and not having fun anymore, and will become a better person if he becomes literate.

She takes the two stickers on the left that have the most distance and places them on her plate.  Then she adds both the two she adds to her plate and the two she adds on the right and puts them on her desk.  After that she adds every sticker from the right except for the two that have the same distance.  She then adds the two that are closest to the left, and subtracts the ones closest to the desk and adds them back to the table.  She keeps adding the last stickers until she has 8 sets of 4 - she will have 8 sets of 4 stickers left.  This is her total score for her homework.<n>Input:A student had to find 2,4,6,8,10,14,16 and 20 stickers, and put them where they belong in order.

After that she starts from a new number, so after her first five pages she is at 25+8+11+15+18+.  After she adds her first page of stickers she adds the sticker left of the first blank for every page from then on.  After 25 she starts adding stickers from her last page in the book.  After she adds each page, she adds the left blank to the right hand side, so when she adds a page she will have at least one blank.  After she adds the last sticker to each page she goes through the entire notebook.<n>Input:Mary had 89 stickers.  This will put her under the 5 page requirement, so she will do an additional 4 pages of work.  At 4 pages she will have her 90 stickers, so she will do another 4 pages and another 2 pages.<n>Input:Mary has 89 stickers.  Two of the pages have 6 stickers.  She adds 2 of those to her notebook.  She turns in the 5 remaining pages and she has 5 left.<n>Output: 42 stickers * 5 + 4 = <<44>>42 stickers<n>In fact we learned that we add +1 from front to back, +1 from back to front, +1 from top to bottom, so at 42 stickers we must add -14 to get <<44>>44 stickers.

(or vice versa)  Output: When you write a mathematics problem do you first write the equations and then the variables?<n>Output: You write the equation first, then the x, then the variables. In this case the equations and variables are: 5 -3 = 5 and 5 -3 = 5.   So here, you wrote the equation first and then the variable 5 and then came the variables - and the equations and variables are 5 - 3 = 10 and 10 - 3 = 10.<n>In this case, a variable is any number between 0 and the number you're currently writing out. In the case of this question, 1 would be the first number and 10 would be the 3rd.  This is equivalent to:<n>In this case this variable 5 would result in 2.<n>In this case this equation would be:<n>In this case 9 would result in 3.<n>In this case 3 would result in 10.<n>You see how simple this works in this one question?<n>In this case, you wrote the variables first, then called the equations. So this equation is:<n>3 - 3 = 9  It's so simple, you're going to have a hard time making it work any other way.  (Your answer will have a number next to it, so you must choose which side you want to write the variable on. However, both options will require you to choose the other option.)<n><n>Input:A car is traveling to L.A. from San Fransisco. The car is stopped in Chicago for 3 days. Which of these is correct?

Remember that the 2 different problems are a variant of the problem where you have 3 variables, x, y and z. Both the types of problems are similar to what you are solving for but with variables, you have two problems to solve. The difference with this problem is that in both problems the values x and y are assigned the same place. Here, we have 2 variables, x and y in this problem.<n><n>Input:You have 5 numbers and 1 character. The value in each of them is 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n>Output:		The human felt a pang of loss as he gazed out the window of his orbital spacecraft. The view was beautiful but the person inside was wishing he could return to earth to explore the beauty of life in the wild, the joy of discovery and the awe of space. He missed his home and loved living on celestial soil and the joys and satisfactions of space exploration. He didn't miss his family too badly, the only trouble was that they loved to be in their homes and he found it to be dull. If it ever got dangerous he'd go back to his homeland but otherwise he'd have to stick it out on earth for now.

It was as if he had been granted a private tour of that one room. Choices:  A) house B) spaceship C) bird D) ship E) earth<n>Output: The human noticed something unusual about birds, not only to the birds but all the other animals as well, they looked at each other curiously and thought to themselves that the human was right, there were no earthly birds like those on the spaceship. They made their mind up and made a decision that it would be a shame for the humans in orbit if they didn't learn to live like birds. Then it dawned on the humans they should take that time to think about their actions because if they didn't they would soon be forgotten like birds on earth when a human had visited the spaceship and returned. It was decided they should spend a few hours each day playing in the forest. Since the forests on earth were a lot more dense and bigger than the human forest they had a lot more fun and it also helped them think better about their actions. So on Earth they had to work hard and get up early in order to practice so they decided they would teach a number of different animals how to fly.<n>They started playing in their forest and had a great time. They also taught different animals to be clever and very creative. In no time they had hundreds of animals in their space ship that would fly and they would enjoy it immensely. Then they decided to teach some other animals to paint, just as an example for the other animals. But then they couldn't think of a

He was the oldest of his siblings and his middle brother died at age 23.<n>He told his mom that his brother was the one that made him feel sick and made him think the same thing.  Therefore, John thought of him as John D for short and John H for "happy" or "birthday."

Notice that the number of words is higher than the number of sentences. How can we predict the most number of words from these sentences? How do you do this on your own?<n><n>When B talks, what words does she say? Again, what are they related to (i.e. fun, sad, happy)? Also which words are more likely to be used in sentence pairs? In a sentence pair that B speaks, what words are the most likely for A to use? Which words may not have obvious ties to one another and in fact could be used in many sentence pairs?<n><n>I will assume that B talks more. How do you predict the number of words or sentences from each sentence?<n><n>Let A write one sentence on the first page of sheet C. On both pages of C, write one sentence together on one line and then one sentence on the next line. Each sentence is one sentence long. On the second sheet, write one sentence on the second line and two sentences on the third line. This is another 1 sentence long sentence.<n><n>On C, write 2 sentences. One sentence is written for A and the other she writes for herself. Now put them together. This is yet another 1 sentence.<n><n>Now put: C A B C D.<n><n>Then put B A B C D C A D D B A B C D. How many sentences are in the answer? How do you do the total? How do you read it after that?<n><n>We want to

Each person speaks for 1 minute.  Each person listens for 1 second.  Each person speaks again and the person at the other end listens for 2 seconds.  If everyone listened once a minute and once every 2 seconds, then only 44 fewer people would talk to each other, but everyone would understand each other 40% better.<n><n>The following questions:<n><n>Input: If everyone listens for a minute they can understand each other half better.

It is very likely that the person with the most stickers understands you better than the person who has 30. If someone has 44 sticker people can understand you half better than the person with 30.  What is the odds of that?<n>Output: There are 33 stickers left, 11 stickers to give your own answer, and 8 remaining stickers. Given that there are 33 stickers, 13 persons could talk with each other a total of 22 minutes. And they would only understand each other 11 minutes, because most people only know each other at most 1 or 2 minutes. Based on that, there are 22 less people who can explain their thoughts better this round, and the average person only understands each other for 13 minutes.<n><n>The following comments:<n><n>Input: That is why we should make a list of all the things that we will talk about in the next round.

Choices:  A) A movie theater B) A movie theater C) A movie theater D) A movie theater<n>Output: J: theater<n><n>Input: Mary and Bob met a guy, Jim, in a movie theater.  He offered to let them have popcorn for free after they bought it.  Mary accepted and sat in the seat Jim held; and Jim invited himself upstairs.  They were pretty excited to be in the same movie theater.  Mary decided to buy a box of popcorn for herself.  What would she buy?  An average sized box would cost $10.00.  But Mary's total would be 40 bucks.  Using the movie's average ticket price, it would take approximately 12 seconds for Mary to pay $40 plus a snack.  But since she doesn't want to be rude to Jim, she said "Thanks,  that'll be fine" and left the theater.  When Mary didn't come next to Jim, he went upstairs to talk to his friends.  She realized she was still sitting in the same exact seat.  Mary asked him, "Hey Jim, did you come upstairs to talk to your friends, or are you just in there talking to yourself?" Jim said "No, I'm in here talking to ya'll."  His friends said they had been in line all night, waiting to get a free popcorn.  They were disappointed that there wasn't a popcorn box with 2 servings in it, for them to share.  It turns out the popcorn that was left outside when Jim purchased the movie was all he had left when he bought the movie, and he didn't have any more of the cheap popcorn that was left there.  The box in Mary's hand was all he had, and all he got to eat.  He was still upset and offered to give Mary some of his extra popcorn to share.  But Mary thought it would be better if they left him alone.<n>Mary felt really guilty about this act of selfish kindness.  She felt like she didn't have anyone to lean on.  She asked herself, "Have I ever shown any kindness to anyone before?"  Jim

You can choose both boxes, but if you choose just one box, the other one is closed.<n><n>** All boxes have one answer option. You have a 1/2 score on each box and a 0/2 on all other box choices.<n><n>If you have multiple boxes, please pick the other boxes when you're creating the first choice. They will then take precedence over the boxes currently selected.<n><n>If you can't choose all boxes on the first item, keep in mind that you also need to have at least two boxes to answer the second item.<n><n>When you are finished, the box with the highest total score will be marked with<n><n>1+2=2<n>1+6=1<n>1+12=12<n>1+20=20<n>1+32=32<n>1+44=44<n><n>and is considered the correct answer. The same applies if you can't choose between the two options, or you don't end up choosing an answer at all.<n><n>Note that this is similar to the way a sentence is read out loud. The box will be marked with the correct word of the sentence, and it will continue from there. For more detail, read "How to Read a Sentence Out Loud". The key is that the sentence should start with the most recent word in the box.<n><n>In this example, the correct answer is 12 since that's the most recent word in box 1, not 20 for box 2.<n><n>If you don't know an exact answer, a common practice is to pick the first item on the board and guess until you get an answer. You can also choose this and try to guess until you get an accurate answer.<n><n>Note: You are allowed to change the answer choice when you're answering a question. You don't have to start with that answer. However, you cannot change your answer choice once you've answered a question or you will get a 0/

Choices:  A: relax B: controversy C: pleasure D: frustration E: needs theater<n>Output:		Art is not difficult to create. It requires no special equipment or materials.  Artistic expression requires the art viewer to appreciate the art.  With respect to the art viewer, the primary task is to enjoy the art.  Most art is enjoyable.  With that said, the art viewer should appreciate and enjoy art created by highly intelligent artists.  Therefore, the art viewer should be able to appreciate, at a minimum, a work containing mathematical formulas.   However, art created by highly intelligent humans should be extremely interesting to the art viewer.  Therefore, to be a high quality artist, the artist must enjoy artistic creation.  For example, when a work of art makes an artist feel happy, that artist is automatically happy.  Therefore, the artist will enjoy the art creation.  However, the artist's happiness in the creation of the art is by itself meaningless for the artist's artistic achievement.  Therefore, the ultimate artist's goal is to engage the art viewer's enjoyment for his or her artistic achievement.<n><n>Input:Mary has 20 stickers on the first page of her journal.

She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:What could happen to a paper if you leave it outside even if it does not move? Choices:  A: one material often recycled B: ripped C: saturated with water D: one dimensional E: crumpled<n>Output:		 A<n>When left outside outside the sun, the paper will degrade as it is exposed to air. For most papers there should be a layer of paper tissue on top of the page allowing the air to circulate to help speed up the decay process.<n>In fact, newspapers are sometimes left without a top piece. Since papers will dry out the edges with sunlight, papers printed with the new printing technology are often left without the cover or top piece and the paper is typically re-torn out and recycled. (You may also see newspapers not with a cover or top piece removed.)<n>However, paper will also absorb moisture from the air as the paper loses its water content.<n>When the paper dries out quickly and the paper becomes wrinkled, it has to be turned at an angle to allow the paper to spread out the wrinkled creases. This causes some paper to bleed through, but it will take a couple weeks to dry the other way.<n>Because of paper's water absorption, paper from a moist environment tends to turn in a wet print. The moistness can be seen as "moist patches" and is usually worse near the corners and the back.<n>When the paper is torn out of a newspaper or book, it takes a while for the moisture to dry completely.<n>When the paper loses it water content, it will also absorb the paper ink. This will cause spots in the print or a streaky look.<n><n>Input: What does the word "melt" refer to? Choices:   D: melting   D: melting A: melting   C: melting E: melting<n>Output: I would guess the melting point (and most likely a melting temperature of something like +120). The melting point of the paper can be changed by taking off the top/cover. This may allow the papers water content to escape if the paper is left outside without air circulation. However, if not done, the water content will remain the same as if the paper was left outside inside.<n>In short, when heat is applied and the paper turns, it has changed the water content and may be melting (since the surface area is bigger) and the paper has been changed from being water-dissipative material to being water-insoluble.<n><n>Input: How many pieces of aluminum foil does it take to make a single piece of foil foil?

Choices A: admiration B: applause C: make reservations D : experience E: sleep<n>output: Everyone clapped and standing.<n><n>In this example, two pieces of data need to be entered. They cannot both be entered into a database.<n><n>Input.<n><n>Input.1: The new play was The go to performance of the 1st year.<n>Output.<n><n>Both pieces of data cannot be placed in the database. This means that there must be some way to sort both pieces of data. Here are some ways that could be done: The player has a button on the left/right to sort pieces of data using a combination of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. These combinations could be used as a key to put pieces of data in the database. Alternatively, each piece of data could be sorted by a key such as "M" which would mean anything in the play could be put in the database. An example of this would be: Player starts by putting in the name of "M" and picks one piece of data. Player then sets "M" to the database, then picks another piece of data. Player sets the next piece of data to the database. Every time player puts in a piece, the remaining pieces of database will be sorted by this key.<n><n>There are two ways to sort the pieces of data after Player sets the keys. Player can place an item in the player's basket, put the item in the basket, then sort the pieces based on the key, or just put the item in the player's "basket" and sort them based on key.<n><n>Input. The new play was the Go to performance of the first year. Output.<n><n>Both pieces need to be entered into the database as separate items. One of these should be the "first" play and the other should be the "go to" play. The latter, if you want to know the outcome of the original play, could be used to get a more accurate result than using the former.<n>

A short while after John's first year and a half of playing his piano with just the stick, he took out the wooden block and the exercise ball. The weight of the wooden stick caused John to hit the keys too fast and he was afraid of his fingers getting tired. Therefore, John switched over to playing the piano with the block and the stick.<n><n>The final answer is 42.

I know some of you will say it wont be but i'm not going to say it's not. If you think it will be 45 then i can answer. I'll make up an example: My professor was talking about making your grade off of the average test time and you'll have 45 minutes to finish the test if your average time is 45 minutes but they don't have a 45 minute test if your average time comes in under 45. You said:<n><n>45 minutes to come back from test X (average time of test is 45)<n><n>45 minutes to finish question A of test X. (average time of test)<n><n>45 minutes left to complete the first 4 of the 10 questions from test Y (average time of test X)<n><n>60 minutes left to be done during exam period (average time of test Y)<n><n>60 minutes total before the exam ends.<n><n>Now, what do you think about that?<n>Out of the total, there are 56 minutes (including time between exams for me), so I could write 54 questions. Some people may see this as wrong...I know it's wrong. When I talk about finishing after the test, it's because I donates some time to the test as a whole so I know I can write 54 questions in 60 minutes.<n><n>I think this test is gonna be 45 minutes though but some of you will say that it will be longer.<n>Here we go! :D<n><n>Click to expand...<n><n>First, how old are you? If you're under 16, then I'd say it won't be for a few weeks yet. I'm 15 and I took the test about a week ago and I'm only just getting a glimpse at the answer. I'd guess next week/end.<n><n>Second, your average time is less than 45 minutes. My average is 45.99, so I could write an average question for you in about 45-50 minutes.<n><n>Third, if the test ends up longer than 45 minutes, you'll have plenty of time to submit other answers to the test. They'll want you to use the time you have left to work on those answers.<n><n>Fourth, this is an SAT

He lived with his children because he didn't want to go where? Choices:  A: republican party B: old people's home C: office D: park E: high school or college<n>Output:		  Lindy's answers are in order.  He used his first house as a home for himself and his kids.  In fact, the house was too small for him and his kids.  He bought a new place and started making house payments on that house using his salary.  Before he was able to pay the full mortgage amount, however, he fell in love with the house and bought a second house.  Then, he sold the house he bought for $100,000 and bought a brand new one for $110,000.  Then he sold that house for $85,000.  Then, he bought a brand new home.  Then, he used the proceeds to pay off debts.<n>In total, Lindy sold off his home for $125,000 and bought another $85,000 home.  He saved $110,000 and bought the whole house.  Then, for the last two houses he has bought, he has only bought money.  The money he borrowed on these houses totaled $140,000.  So in the end he has $140,000 left which he has paid off and saved $50,000 for himself and his kids and in the process saved $45,000 for the kids.<n>In the example in this post, Lindy didn't use his money.  He used his salary + money borrowed to buy money.  Since Lindy didn't use money to buy houses, Lindy's answer isn't correct.<n>The correct answer is A, B, C, or D.  Since D has no answer except "office", Lindy chose D.  The correct answer to the question "Which of the following is true?" is "A: Lindy bought homes for $80,000 and $70,000 and then sold the home for $84,000 $42,000 for himself, $30,000 for himself, and $30,000 for his kids."<n>Lindy's correct answer was A which is correct.<n><n>Input:I want to know how many stickers I have left.<n>Input: I want to know how many items I have left.<n>Output: I want to know the total number of items I have left.

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:Where is a monkey likely to be found in the rainforest? Choices:  A: tree tops B: rain forest C: zoological gardens D: great outdoors E: zoo<n>Output:		 The monkey is likely to be found at  B.  It is known that the monkeys of the rainforest have been known to jump from tree tops to the ground. This is not a common thing to see.  To illustrate this, let's say you have 8 of your stickers, 5 large, 2 small, and one medium sized. You put one large sticker from tree top A and one small sticker from tree top B on each of  B = 8 stickers. You add a medium sized sticker from tree top D, placing it on another large sticker from tree top C. This brings up your sticker inventory to 12. As you can see, this is a fair way to look at it, because 1) no large stickers mean 1 less sticker inventory, and 2) medium stickers mean 2 more stickers. So your total sticker inventory is 12 - 8 = 8.  This makes it more difficult to add up your inventory since you're dealing directly with stickers rather than tokens.<n><n>Input:To a) draw a large tree B) draw a small tree C) draw a medium sized tree D) draw an animal F) draw a person G) draw a building H) draw a house J) draw a wall<n>Output: Draw a large tree, a small tree, a medium sized tree, and a medium sized animal. Draw a large tree and a small tree next to each other, as well as 1 medium sized animal. This makes it very difficult to have only one animal left, but you still have 12 in your inventory.<n><n>Input:A woman and her dog are walking down the street and see a large house on land B.

He felt like laughing as he realized that this was not the answer to the question. He looked at the map of the USA and saw the words “Elephants.”  He asked if these words referred to an elephant that he knew but not the same type.  “Yes,  Andrew,  this is an elephant, ” he answered.  “But he is so different from all elephants that I know that it is hard to tell him apart from all of them.”  Andrew said that he felt a bit strange in this situation.

He turned to his wife and said,  "It's time to clean the house."  She gave him a look, went into the kitchen, and came out with a broom.  He looked up at her with disbelief.  "It can't be cleaned," he declared.  "I haven't even eaten."  So she went back to the kitchen and brought in a bucket of water to spray down all the kitchen counter tops.  A few minutes later, he heard the sweeping and looked up to see what she had done.  He was shocked.  His wife had come back into the living room with a broom.  She was sweeping the living room with the broom, just as he had commanded.  She wiped the dirty windows, painted the kitchen counters, and swept all the furniture.  It looked like she was on her honeymoon.  The only place that wasn't swept was in the bathroom, where she had been cleaning herself.  He stood there in disbelief. He was going to be late for lunch because the house was so cleaned out. Where was Bob going to go for lunch?  He could only think of one place he would be going: to the kitchen for a glass of water.  "You're supposed to do the sweeping, not the sweeping," he said.  "I ate everything I brought you."  She was angry.  "Well,"

Choices:  A: misery B: sadness C: bad time D: sorrow E: play time<n>Output:		 The woman was not happy with her life.  (She was in misery).  Therefore, she played the card.  The question is why? Why did she play this card?  If you are playing to win please choose to play the card that is better than your opponent.  If you are playing for enjoyment please choose to chose to play the card that makes you laugh.  If you are trying to convince someone to play a game, you probably want to play a game you both love (you might have an opening and your opponent doesn't, the game you love might not be out yet, or they might have better cards).<n>If you are trying to convince yourself then you should pick a game that makes you happy.  It is likely that your opponent has a better selection of games than you do (your favorite is not out yet, you don't have a deck you know the rules for, etc.).  In this case, to convince yourself you probably won't play the best games.  If you are an old man playing with young kids, your goal probably isn't to convince the children that they are wrong.  It's probably to convince the children that you don't mind playing a game they enjoy (you might be playing a game you don't enjoy to make the kids feel bad when they make a mistake or need to learn.)

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:If someone is outgoing what are they likely to seek? Choices:  A: new experiences B: playfulness C: own house D: good looking E: beautiful<n>Output:		If someone is outgoing then they will likely seek: A: new experiences 2: playfulness 3: own house 4: good looking 5: beautiful 6: beautiful<n>Since people are likely to be outgoing then they will likely: A: new experiences B B C D D<n>Outputs should be consistent since there are multiple ways to read or interpret someone's answers. You should only provide answers that are unambiguous or can be readily inferred. If someone writes the response but offers another possible interpretation, for example by writing "D" or "R" instead of "A" or "B", it is generally considered to be better (or even correct) to provide an alternative answer(s).<n><n>Input:I have a problem with my ex-girlfriend.  Her friend and I both moved in together.  We like different things and her ex-boyfriend is not her type.  She wants to move in again but I feel like I need to keep my distance.  What should I do to ensure we don’t spend a lot of time together when we are both with our new boyfriends?<n>Output:Do nothing. Be friends.<n>Because you already have a problem with her new boyfriend, it may seem appropriate to maintain "don't bring her back" in your daily vernacular. If you continue to maintain that attitude you won't be able to establish a healthy relationship with anyone else.<n><n>Input:I believe there are three people who can do miracles.  They are a magician, a witch and a priest.  Which three people would make the best 3?<n>Output:It depends on the type of miracle you want. If you want a real life one then you should go with the magician. If you want a character that you see on TV and see in movies then you should go with Wiccans. If you want a person who is a very powerful medium through whom you can communicate then you should choose a priest.<n><n>The question says the 3 closest people to the magician are the closest people to the priest. If you want to use this type of question in a real life scenario then the closest relative (mother, father etc.) should be the closest friend to the priest. Therefore, you should choose the priest's closest relative to be the closest friend to him/her as well. This way you will be a good person, while also getting a good result in your situation.<n><n>I like the above question because the question is an invitation to share something. Asking what

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:The teachers needed to get their classrooms ready for the school year.  What is one thing they might do? Choices:  A: talk too much B: teach children C: open boxes D: answering questions E: giving homework<n>Output:		 The Teachers listed 5 solutions to this problem and used B, C, D, and E as their explanations for their solution.<n>Solution:<n>Give students an opportunity to learn a lesson by using a box as a tool. This is a problem where they have to learn math and add by combining two numbers with some type of a number (the numbers in their own class may be too large for this). In this case the numbers were 2, 3 and 12 because one of those numbers is two and one of the other numbers is three. The problem is to subtract these two numbers and then add them again and that is the sum you get. For example if we say ABC is two plus seven then the sum might look like seven plus ten because ten is one and one is two. This problem is great for introducing the concept of adding with different numbers and it takes a while to get used to. It also teaches the idea of multiplication because we have to start adding up these two separate numbers in order to find the sum that is the same as the sum of the one plus the one minus the two.

The answer is that she would have bought a computer based on the contents of the package that Emily received before the purchase. The answer is the "computer package of the day" is available to the family (and this may be what Emily bought). The answer is that the difference between a $20 computer and a $100 computer is equal to the difference between a $200 computer and a $1,000 computer.

Where might he spend most of his time today? Choices:  A: university B: college class C: class room D: classroom E: library<n>Output:		 James took a trip to the college class room to read the book that was due for the class that night.<n>Since he had only a half hour and it was too late for him to leave the building, he decided to work on the project he was given.<n>Since he worked on the project all afternoon as well, he took a brief 30 minute break from school and went to the office to make a quick copy of the project he had just finished for his report.<n>During his half hour break, James decided to do the first two pages of research that were to be the basis for his report.<n>Since he was not sure what he was going to do, he decided to do a quick research project that will help him figure out where he started from today.  If he had known he would have written down any of the project steps that he would have taken during the course of his first semester, he could have used his time to do the research that he wanted to do.<n>Since James knows little bit of physics, he decided to do his paper about the wavefunction from a physics perspective.  Physics will be taught in physics class so if James can come up with a way to learn about them when he is sitting in class, it will be more useful later on in his life.<n>Since he did not have a physics book to look up on when he was looking up materials for the project, he decided to use an eTextbook to do the research.  Since he started off with using the ETextbook, he found he was more familiar with the material when looking through these type of books for the first time than when he had read them before hand.<n>From an electrical engineering perspective, he decided to do the paper looking up a method for predicting when the electrons that pass through a conductor may be moving at a different velocity than expected.  The way that some of the current through the conductor is much faster than what he expected.<n>He did not realize that the wavefunction was a function of the electrons and not the energy that the electrons have.  He thought that if the particles have energy greater than their kinetic energy, they would have momentum greater than they had when they were moving through the conductor, but the waves would have less energy than what was expected if the electrons have kinetic energy.  He thought that is what the wavefunction is based on.<n>Since time permits, James decided to continue his research and find a way to make the results his paper shows and learn about it.<n>Since he works

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:What is a fast but expensive way to send small cargo? Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n>Output:		An airplane can carry up to 50 kilograms; two ships can carry 1,000 kilograms each; and 2 trucks can carry 100 kg each. A fast delivery is 10 km (6 miles) under 1 minute per km. Since the delivery has a speed of 10 km per hour, it is 2 x 10 km = 20 km per hour. So 5 000 km per hour = 3.3 km per minute = 33%. It is then 5 km to reach the destination. So the delivery is 10 km per hour. Hence the delivery is 3 m per minute. The delivery of goods in a 3 m per minute delivery is 33% slower than the delivery by airplane. So the delivery by water is slower. So the shipping by train is faster than the delivery by air. The cargo is weighed, packed and shipped by airplane or ship.  If the choice is between airplane and ship, it is clear that airplane is faster.<n><n>Solution Summary<n><n>This activity presents the problem of using fast and expensive ways to send small cargo. This activity is based on the following question:<n><n>Input: What is a fast but expensive ways to send small payload for fast and cost efficient shipment?<n>Output: An airplane can carry up to 2 000 kg; a ship can carry up to 9 000 kg; and an airplane can carry up to 1 000 kg; a ship has a fuel tank of 9000 kg and an empty capacity of 90 kg; an airplane can carry 1 000 kg and has an empty capacity of 270 kg; a ship has an empty capacity of 90; and an airplane has a fuel tank of 30000 kg and an empty capacity over 60000 kg; an airplane can can carry 1 200 kg and has an empty weight of 5 000 kg. A ship has an empty capacity and an empty fuel tank capacity of 30 000 kg and an empty weight of 100 000 kg; an airplane has 3 000 kg and 600kg over 8000 kg; an airplane has 6200 kg and 7500 kg over 16500 kg; and an airplane has 50000 kg and 80000 kg over 30 million kg.

Choices: Comfort A: sleep quality B: light, dark or no lights C: environmental factors D: sleeping in a familiar setting E: noise<n>Output:What is the 3rd most important factor to a good night's night's sleep? Chooses: The amount of sleep you receive, physical environment, social situation and body structure<n>Output: Why is it more important to sleep under a lighted ceiling than in a dark room? Chooses: The darkness is less likely to trigger nightmares. You do not have to wake up if you are sleeping. You are less likely to have bad dreams if your environment is dark. A lighted ceiling helps you feel less tired when you are sleeping as you do not have to work as hard to sleep. It is more comfortable. A lighted room makes you feel more rested because you do not have to wake yourself up to go to bed. If you need to use the bathroom, you can keep a light on the other side of the room. Choices: Use a nightlight that lights up at a certain time (2am or 6am and so on) if at all possible. You can also keep a fan next to your bed. This is not the best option but it is a start. If you have any type of allergies, you can find a lighted dust mask in your local drug store. You can also wear a mask under your sheet before you get to bed. If you prefer to sleep in a dark room, you can always have a light on your ceiling. Chooses: Dark room B: room has no sound A: kitchen B: living room C: outside D: bedroom<n>Output: Try to have a consistent sleeping pattern both during the day and at night. If you need to, use the light in your bedroom for one hour before going to sleep. Set a light timer with a small amount of time for it to fade out every half hour or so. You can do this at both night and day. If you have pets, it is okay to turn the light on a few hours before you go to bed to make your pet not so frightened by the bright sunlight during the night. If you have pets and are planning to go to bed, you will need to put a blanket over the dogs or cats just before you lay them down. This will help prevent their tails from scratching your legs. The blanket will also keep your dog from running around and making a mess. You may need

The word is worded with just one correct answer answer key.<n><n>In the same sentence there is a sentence that goes with the previous one, however, in this sentence the only word in it that is not spelled J is K, so there is the possibility that there are words missing from the sentence. In the sentence following the previous one there are two words that are spelled K in it, so those two words are the ones that will be used to answer this question.<n>Input:<n>Here is the third sentence of the question:<n>“Every county in this state has a problem...”. The word “every” is missing from this sentence. But here is an answer key spelling out K with its answer key answer of “No”.<n>Output:<n>The word is spelled out K with its answer word answer key of “No’.<n>In my mind this sentence is saying that no counties in this state have a population problem. This is the same as saying that every state has a problem with a population problem. If this is the case then the entire sentence is correct. However, in my answer key answer key of “no”, I believe there is only 1 incorrect answer word because the 3 Ks do not have any correct answers.

After greeting him and his customer both at the same time, he asked the salesman if either of them wanted a loan or used car. The salesman replied that they need a new vehicle because their current vehicle has a major failure (a crack in the rear window). The sales assistant was surprised; he asked if he could have more details. The salesman explained that his shop was not able to sell the vehicle as there is no engine warranty and the dealership will only sell it if the customer can provide proof that the cracked window is the fault of the shop. The salesman proceeded to ask the customer if he can go into the back to remove the window himself. The customer nodded his/her head (indicating that he could), then he/she got into the back seat, put the new windshield over the crack and asked the salesman again if he could sell it. After the salesman explained the same thing as before, the customer asked if he could buy a new car in place of the old one. The salesman replied that he does not have a lot of stock to replace. The customer informed the salesman that he is an attorney specializing in automobile accident, and he doesn't think he should sell their loaner car. The salesman promised that they would look at the car and the sales assistant told the salesman that it may be a good idea for them to let the shop repair the vehicle first and then sell it to the client to repair it. The salesman agreed and suggested that they get started. The salesman also offered the customer service for the new car and after giving the customer the address, he asked him to leave the store.

The salesman told the customer that he looks forward to seeing him at work tomorrow. The salesman left and went back into the car dealership. As he walked back into the waiting areas where the auto loaner cars were being parked, he passed by the sales assistant. The sales assistant saw the salesman and apologized for having said the wrong thing to him, and the salesman gave him a "very nice" gesture. When the sales assistant saw that the man was still angry with her, he apologized again to him and took him to the back of the waiting area. After the sales assistant finished apologising to the sales assistant, he went to the back of the dealership and told the salesman to

(You must list at least three adjectives.)  You must choose one of these: friendly, outgoing, smart, etc.   This is a very open-ended question.  Please keep in mind that some people are shy and reserved and some people are extroverted and outgoing.  In addition, if no adjectives are listed (e.g., people have to guess), you cannot use "he/she" in any of your responses.  I'll be more concerned with people's social personalities if they have been described.  I also have several open-ended questions dealing with the personality differences that come to mind.  To see what adjectives people chose, go to my main question, page 3.  I will be giving a few minutes to respond to all the questions and I'll pick the person I think comes up the best, after which I'll continue asking people what they think.<n><n>Output:First, I'll answer all the open-ended questions.  I have two more open-ended questions and one other closed-ended question.  Then I'll answer every other question.  Thank you for your interest in the project and I hope you have fun taking apart my clues.  Best wishes,<n><n>John

I was living in a tent with my parents and my brother. We were living on a land that was about 100 meters from the ocean. It was a beautiful day, however, we could not sit outside. It was so much dust and dirt that I began losing eyesight. After a while, my sister said, "Let's go to the sea." My father went ahead with our supplies and I also followed. We climbed into the tent and sat down by the ocean. We were both very excited to see the sea. We watched the sand grains moving from one side of the tent to the other. Suddenly, something fell into the tent and a huge fish jumped out of the water. We heard some of the sand grains in our tent begin to float away. It was moving swiftly on the ocean waves. I could not believe it. We took off our headbands in unison, because we were now very afraid. Then we all saw the fish rise into the sky. All of us shouted and screamed, except for my sister, who was crying. Then we saw the big fish get ready to jump into the ocean. We grabbed our supplies off the ground and ran after the fish. We rushed to one side of the tent and ran down into the ocean. We got about 15 meters down into the ocean, when the fish jumped out of the ocean. I tried running fast, but the fish outstripped me. When the fish started moving through the air, we shouted a few times and ran towards the other side. I reached the other side of the ocean and ran towards my family. We were all crying because we were afraid that the fish would not come back, and we all saw the same thing. We were about to get out of the tent, when a fish jumped out. I grabbed my family by the shoulders and screamed, "Run now, we must run or the fish will come right down the middle of you!" My father ran and ran to catch up with the fish. We chased him and threw our arms in the air. We could see the sea waves breaking and crashing on the rocks. We were very excited and ran towards the beach, where we were about to enter the water. The next moment the fish fell into the water and disappeared. We were all scared, because we still had not seen any fish. After a while we saw a fish swimming towards us. What did you say? A:

However, since this project was about molecules, I would probably write atom, especially since it is the smallest of the four questions.<n>In the other categories, I would write "anything" for the answer.  This would be a lot more appropriate than an answer containing just "air" as it is so vague.<n>The "feet" category seems like this should be called "something" rather than "feet."  However, since many people use feet in their daily lives, I would probably just use feet.<n><n>You should be able to work out that some of the choices are more appropriate than others.  For this example, let us imagine that we are going to work out some of the details by actually drawing a diagram.  In this example you really only need to find out how many atoms fall into each category.  You could do some research on the number of atoms in each category to figure out where to work it in.

Even though I am not in the school system, I was always taught how to write and where to write. I was always taught how the "book-writing style" was called, as I was in the school system. When I was in school, my teachers assigned them to me to write and if they did not choose what to write (which they never did), I was not told what to write and they used their own writing style as they preferred. This is how I learned to write well and now I write so consistently and accurately that it is almost like I never have to look at my own writing.  When I was growing up it wasn't different from how I did it now and then I would try to explain it to my teachers if they did not understand it, but they never had an excuse. I was always taught to let them write the books for me and that I did not ask questions about what they wrote because I was trained to do that.<n>Input:Mary said, “My brother and brother-in-law were both on a waiting list to get in line today at my elementary school.

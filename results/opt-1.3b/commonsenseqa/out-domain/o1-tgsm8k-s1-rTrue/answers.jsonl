John is giving us a very hard problem and asking us to solve it without getting distracted. His question isn't even asking us to give it a name, it isn't even asking us how we would respond to it. It's basically saying, \"John, take a moment, think about each of the three answers and how you would respond to each.\"\n\nIf this seems difficult or it has seemed difficult in the past for other groups, it's probably because our brains are trained to make decisions quickly. Sometimes we know things that are important quickly.

I suggest the following:\n1. Have yourself a chat with Michael and tell him to make as many labels as he wants and put all of them on the same piece of paper and fill in the spaces with your own sticky notes and put the other piece of paper in a ziploc bag and take them to school with him so he can print out his labels, but only as long as there are stickers on your friend's paper. That would put all the stickers on the paper into your pocket at the same time. So you would at least have the paper of several of your friends to play with.\n\n2. Your friend would have to make a total of 8 labels. Each label could have 4 stickers on it, and you could fill in the gaps with your sticky notes as he does his.\n\n3. If Michael's answer is correct, then we are all going to get stuck this year with the answer of what to do with the 6th and last sticker, but neither you or Michael ever knew the answer either. In other words, in all likelihood the same problem will occur as you were looking for. So my suggestion is to just ask the teacher. Just tell her that last year she never answered your question.

I asked about this game's packaging, asking students to look at the front page of the game and the back page. It was a big group of students and by the time I asked the question, I was overwhelmed with the answers because they were all on the same page. I wanted to get a second opinion, and I did.\nI asked him to read the instruction booklet, which was on that page. Then I asked his student to read the instruction booklet and I got the same answer. He did it again and said he didn't see anything out of the ordinary. He knew exactly what you meant. This is the problem with teaching kids. You have to have second opinions, and this time I heard it. I took notes and shared this study with our teacher council member who asked if it was a common thing. The consensus was that it was. I wanted this lesson to be about packaging, since the book says it is a review of what the kid is going to buy. This means that the kids would have to buy it themselves. When you are teaching a lesson about the packing process, it doesn't matter if kids know what they are going to buy or not. It is their homework, and they have to do it.\n\nI think that the book isn't a perfect example of how packaging is done, because the packers don't have to add the stickers all the time, they can use glue sticks instead. This question also goes back to packaging for toys. In a box, it's good because a kid already knows what they are going to get. In a bag, you have to put the sticker on your fridge, so it's harder to say that a kid knows what they are getting. If you are going to do a review of a unit, you want to have people look at the lesson and the products first. Having kids buy the items is easy (assuming you aren't teaching kids to buy something for the first time), but having all the stickers around it makes it seem more involved. It would be just as interesting either way, but if a", "answer": "A: supermarket"}

{"text": "He would buy a dog to cuddle with and spend time with her.  If he wasn't a bachelor he would also visit her, maybe even move in with her.  Her brother would write her letters every month asking her how things were for him.\n\nAssignment:\nTo solve the assignment, I had to look at the information I had about this couple in order to deduce what their personal relationship might be. As students, some of us might have been influenced by our parents, so I'm looking at their history together and their attitudes towards family to try to find things they could have in common.\n\n1. Their history together\n\nIn the short relationship history, it's clear that their age isn't an obstacle. As their son was three when they were together, their relationship has probably been going on for a while. They lived together (though separated) for quite a while (5 years). Their son was one when they were together. She was the one who supported him as he adjusted to a new family. When he moved out, she still supported him. It's clear she is the one who instilled morals, morals that he still practices.\n\n2. What was the main event in this couple's recent lives?\nFrom the information I had, the most recent event in her life was starting her job. Her son was starting kindergarten. Her brother was entering his first year of university. While they did date back during their marriage, they lived in separate states for many years after their marriage. He lived in Colorado and she lived in Virginia. They met at the beginning of the decade but their relationships didn't go far beyond this. In addition, she didn't write very often, rarely if ever sent a postcard home for her brother. She never wrote him more than what she sent him home for meals. Perhaps the most major event that I can think of was when she started her job. This is probably the only time she really put much thought into how to treat her son, because there wasn't much of a difference between the two of them.\n\n3. How and why are they similar?\nSince she had the longest (10 years) relationship, they have both always had high standards for themselves. She would make plans that the rest weren't happy with. Her son is the same way. If the rest of the family was upset with the dinner plans, she would just let the rest decide when he came to dinner. Her brother, on the other hand, would push", "answer": "C: make love"}

How far does the federal government move towards government control of the economy?\n\nInput:  I have read the article \"The American dream\" and the article \"We are going to kill the american dream\" both written by Ron Paul. I believe Ron Paul is the only one that knows what's going on with our economy. I believe he has been around long enough to be at least a little bit of an expert on what's going on.  I believe he has a long time ahead of him before he dies and his son takes his place.

He has the right plan and the right ideas to bring about a better society.  He isn't afraid of change and isn't afraid to face problems head on. He has the potential to save America by creating an economy that will really work for the people and that is free of government intrusion.

Judy served two terms as a school board member.  During each two year term Judy held a position on the school board.  At the time of the election of Judy as a school board member, she was a member of the high school class, age 14.  As a high school student Judy was also on the school's newspaper and art staffs.  During Judy's first few years on the school board, she held several positions on the school board. During her final year on the school board (age 17) Judy was appointed as the new president (and class secretary) of the high school's student council.\nIn the summer of 1998 Judy was a member of an organization called \"Sugar Creek Seniors.\"  Judy and her friends formed this organization and organized a few fundraising events around campus.  Judy also volunteered for various other organizations in town.\nDuring the time Judy was a member of that organization, there was also a group of teenagers named \"The Bullys.\"  One of that group's members later challenged Judy to a fight in the parking lot of a local convenience store.  During this event, Judy ended up with a broken nose, as well as multiple other facial lacerations.  While Judy spent several days in the hospital, the Bullys continued to meet.  They continued to be active members of the school's student body, as well as members of the local organization.  The Bullys eventually stopped meeting, because the members and organizers were too traumatized by what happened to Judy to continue meeting.  Judy's physical injuries from the fight remained a source of emotional frustration and anger for her, during and after the incident with the Bullys.\nWhile looking through this scrapbook last night, I found a few memories of an incident from my high school days.  I decided to write a review of some of the highlights of my high school experience, with the goal of creating some sort of a chronological record of my high school years.  This also happens to be a record of the first time I ever made a \"snarky\" joke.

The question was:\n\nWe don't have to worrying about numbers the same way that we might for words, and each letter of our alphabet has a different number.\n\nAnswer: I guess my answer is that words are all numbers. You can't start a word with a capital letter and then spell it. Words are made up of numbers (a-z). In the story we have started, the numbers are even.\n\nMy response to this would be no not really, because you can start a word with a lowercase letter and then spell it, and the word becomes a number. Words are made up from numbers.\n\nAnswer: The only difference I can think of between how numbers and letters are used, is that the number for the last word in the sentence was omitted in the title. The title would be something like \"John\" so \"john\" should be number 2, but he had number 2 omitted. Therefore he is illiterate and cannot write. As you said, he will learn more than knowing how to write.\n\nSo we decided that he is illiterate and not having fun anymore, and will become a better person if he becomes literate.", "answer": "D: illiterate"}

In this case the equations and variables are: 5 -3 = 5 and 5 -3 = 5.   So here, you wrote the equation first and then the variable 5 and then came the variables - and the equations and variables are 5 - 3 = 10 and 10 - 3 = 10.\nIn this case, a variable is any number between 0 and the number you're currently writing out. In the case of this question, 1 would be the first number and 10 would be the 3rd.

Both the types of problems are similar to what you are solving for but with variables, you have two problems to solve. The difference with this problem is that in both problems the values x and y are assigned the same place. Here, we have 2 variables, x and y in this problem.\n\nInput:You have 5 numbers and 1 character. The value in each of them is 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. There is a character on each line so that you will write this number as x and as a 6 on each line.\nOutput:X-12-x<=>: X-x<=>: 9-x\n\nInput: You have 3 variables in your inventory and you are given 5 numbers.

They also taught different animals to be clever and very creative. In no time they had hundreds of animals in their space ship that would fly and they would enjoy it immensely.

{"text": "Art is not difficult to create. It requires no special equipment or materials.  Artistic expression requires the art viewer to appreciate the art.  With respect to the art viewer, the primary task is to enjoy the art.  Most art is enjoyable.  With that said, the art viewer should appreciate and enjoy art created by highly intelligent artists.  Therefore, the art viewer should be able to appreciate, at a minimum, a work containing mathematical formulas.   However, art created by highly intelligent humans should be extremely interesting to the art viewer.  Therefore, to be a high quality artist, the artist must enjoy artistic creation.  For example, when a work of art makes an artist feel happy, that artist is automatically happy.  Therefore, the artist will enjoy the art creation.  However, the artist's happiness in the creation of the art is by itself meaningless for the artist's artistic achievement.  Therefore, the ultimate artist's goal is to engage the art viewer's enjoyment for his or her artistic achievement.\n\nInput:Mary has 20 stickers on the first page of her journal.

{"text": "A\nWhen left outside outside the sun, the paper will degrade as it is exposed to air. For most papers there should be a layer of paper tissue on top of the page allowing the air to circulate to help speed up the decay process.\nIn fact, newspapers are sometimes left without a top piece. Since papers will dry out the edges with sunlight, papers printed with the new printing technology are often left without the cover or top piece and the paper is typically re-torn out and recycled. (You may also see newspapers not with a cover or top piece removed.)\nHowever, paper will also absorb moisture from the air as the paper loses its water content.\nWhen the paper dries out quickly and the paper becomes wrinkled, it has to be turned at an angle to allow the paper to spread out the wrinkled creases. This causes some paper to bleed through, but it will take a couple weeks to dry the other way.\nBecause of paper's water absorption, paper from a moist environment tends to turn in a wet print. The moistness can be seen as \"moist patches\" and is usually worse near the corners and the back.\nWhen the paper is torn out of a newspaper or book, it takes a while for the moisture to dry completely.\nWhen the paper loses it water content, it will also absorb the paper ink. This will cause spots in the print or a streaky look.\n\nInput: What does the word \"melt\" refer to? Choices:   D: melting   D: melting A: melting   C: melting E: melting\nOutput: I would guess the melting point (and most likely a melting temperature of something like +120). The melting point of the paper can be changed by taking off the top/cover. This may allow the papers water content to escape if the paper is left outside without air circulation. However, if not done, the water content will remain the same as if the paper was left outside inside.\nIn short, when heat is applied and the paper turns, it has changed the water content and may be melting (since the surface area is bigger) and the paper has been changed from being water-dissipative material to being water-insoluble.\n\nInput: How many pieces of aluminum foil does it take to make a single piece of foil foil?

She would draw a picture of the pencil case with some objects in it, write on it, and put it on her bulletin board.  The teacher did this for about a week, showing the students the pencil case.  She did this several more times, each time showing a different set of objects in the pencil case.  On the third day, one of the students asked if the pencil case was ever empty.  The teacher said no, because whenever she opened, she'd find a pencil in it.  Thus, the student went home with an empty pencil case for the first 24 days of school.  When she got to school the next morning, the pencil case was empty.  The teacher showed her the item that had been in the pencil case on the third day, and she said, \"Well.\"  When she got home, she found a pencil in her pencil case.

This means that there must be some way to sort both pieces of data. Here are some ways that could be done: The player has a button on the left/right to sort pieces of data using a combination of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. These combinations could be used as a key to put pieces of data in the database. Alternatively, each piece of data could be sorted by a key such as \"M\" which would mean anything in the play could be put in the database. An example of this would be: Player starts by putting in the name of \"M\" and picks one piece of data. Player then sets \"M\" to the database, then picks another piece of data. Player sets the next piece of data to the database. Every time player puts in a piece, the remaining pieces of database will be sorted by this key.\n\nThere are two ways to sort the pieces of data after Player sets the keys.

I know some of you will say it wont be but i'm not going to say it's not. If you think it will be 45 then i can answer. I'll make up an example: My professor was talking about making your grade off of the average test time and you'll have 45 minutes to finish the test if your average time is 45 minutes but they don't have a 45 minute test if your average time comes in under 45. You said:\n\n45 minutes to come back from test X (average time of test is 45)\n\n45 minutes to finish question A of test X.

Some people may see this as wrong...I know it's wrong. When I talk about finishing after the test, it's because I donates some time to the test as a whole so I know I can write 54 questions in 60 minutes.\n\nI think this test is gonna be 45 minutes though but some of you will say that it will be longer.\nHere we go! :D\n\nClick to expand...\n\nFirst, how old are you? If you're under 16, then I'd say it won't be for a few weeks yet. I'm 15 and I took the test about a week ago and I'm only just getting a glimpse at the answer. I'd guess next week/end.\n\nSecond, your average time is less than 45 minutes. My average is 45.99, so I could write an average question for you in about 45-50 minutes.\n\nThird, if the test ends up longer than 45 minutes, you'll have plenty of time to submit other answers to the test. They'll want you to use the time you have left to work on those answers.\n\nFourth, this is an SAT", "answer": "E: arkansas"}

Then, he sold the house he bought for $100,000 and bought a brand new one for $110,000.  Then he sold that house for $85,000.  Then, he bought a brand new home.

She used 9 large stickers and 11 stickers each to 11 other pages of her journal, so when she entered her bet, she had 5 large stickers left.  How many stickers does Mary now have remaining?\nOutput:\\n\\n\nMary added 89 stickers to her journal: 109*6=211*9=269, which is exactly how many stickers you see in the picture.  This means that Mary now has 269 - 109 = 219 stickers left.\nSince Mary started with 69 stickers, she now has 69 - 109 = 219 stickers available for betting.\nSince she has 29 stickers remaining on her journal, she currently has 29 - 109 = 109 stickers available for betting. You can see that this number is very close to the 59 and 60 stickers you see in the pictures. This means that I was right and that you were wrong.

{"text": "The Teachers listed 5 solutions to this problem and used B, C, D, and E as their explanations for their solution.\nSolution:\nGive students an opportunity to learn a lesson by using a box as a tool. This is a problem where they have to learn math and add by combining two numbers with some type of a number (the numbers in their own class may be too large for this). In this case the numbers were 2, 3 and 12 because one of those numbers is two and one of the other numbers is three. The problem is to subtract these two numbers and then add them again and that is the sum you get. For example if we say ABC is two plus seven then the sum might look like seven plus ten because ten is one and one is two. This problem is great for introducing the concept of adding with different numbers and it takes a while to get used to. It also teaches the idea of multiplication because we have to start adding up these two separate numbers in order to find the sum that is the same as the sum of the one plus the one minus the two.", "answer": "C: open boxes"}

{"text": "An airplane can carry up to 50 kilograms; two ships can carry 1,000 kilograms each; and 2 trucks can carry 100 kg each. A fast delivery is 10 km (6 miles) under 1 minute per km. Since the delivery has a speed of 10 km per hour, it is 2 x 10 km = 20 km per hour. So 5 000 km per hour = 3.3 km per minute = 33%. It is then 5 km to reach the destination. So the delivery is 10 km per hour. Hence the delivery is 3 m per minute. The delivery of goods in a 3 m per minute delivery is 33% slower than the delivery by airplane. So the delivery by water is slower. So the shipping by train is faster than the delivery by air. The cargo is weighed, packed and shipped by airplane or ship.

Chooses: The amount of sleep you receive, physical environment, social situation and body structure\nOutput: Why is it more important to sleep under a lighted ceiling than in a dark room? Chooses: The darkness is less likely to trigger nightmares. You do not have to wake up if you are sleeping. You are less likely to have bad dreams if your environment is dark. A lighted ceiling helps you feel less tired when you are sleeping as you do not have to work as hard to sleep. It is more comfortable. A lighted room makes you feel more rested because you do not have to wake yourself up to go to bed. If you need to use the bathroom, you can keep a light on the other side of the room. Choices: Use a nightlight that lights up at a certain time (2am or 6am and so on) if at all possible. You can also keep a fan next to your bed. This is not the best option but it is a start. If you have any type of allergies, you can find a lighted dust mask in your local drug store. You can also wear a mask under your sheet before you get to bed. If you prefer to sleep in a dark room, you can always have a light on your ceiling. Chooses: Dark room B: room has no sound A: kitchen B: living room C: outside D: bedroom\nOutput: Try to have a consistent sleeping pattern both during the day and at night. If you need to, use the light in your bedroom for one hour before going to sleep. Set a light timer with a small amount of time for it to fade out every half hour or so. You can do this at both night and day. If you have pets, it is okay to turn the light on a few hours before you go to bed to make your pet not so frightened by the bright sunlight during the night. If you have pets and are planning to go to bed, you will need to put a blanket over the dogs or cats just before you lay them down. This will help prevent their tails from scratching your legs.

{"text": "Write the following passage in English (not your native language): I remember the moment when I was seven years old. I was living in a tent with my parents and my brother. We were living on a land that was about 100 meters from the ocean. It was a beautiful day, however, we could not sit outside. It was so much dust and dirt that I began losing eyesight. After a while, my sister said, \"Let's go to the sea.\" My father went ahead with our supplies and I also followed. We climbed into the tent and sat down by the ocean. We were both very excited to see the sea. We watched the sand grains moving from one side of the tent to the other. Suddenly, something fell into the tent and a huge fish jumped out of the water. We heard some of the sand grains in our tent begin to float away. It was moving swiftly on the ocean waves. I could not believe it. We took off our headbands in unison, because we were now very afraid. Then we all saw the fish rise into the sky. All of us shouted and screamed, except for my sister, who was crying. Then we saw the big fish get ready to jump into the ocean. We grabbed our supplies off the ground and ran after the fish. We rushed to one side of the tent and ran down into the ocean. We got about 15 meters down into the ocean, when the fish jumped out of the ocean. I tried running fast, but the fish outstripped me. When the fish started moving through the air, we shouted a few times and ran towards the other side. I reached the other side of the ocean and ran towards my family. We were all crying because we were afraid that the fish would not come back, and we all saw the same thing. We were about to get out of the tent, when a fish jumped out. I grabbed my family by the shoulders and screamed, \"Run now, we must run or the fish will come right down the middle of you!\" My father ran and ran to catch up with the fish. We chased him and threw our arms in the air. We could see the sea waves breaking and crashing on the rocks. We were very excited and ran towards the beach, where we were about to enter the water. The next moment the fish fell into the water and disappeared. We were all scared, because we still had not seen any fish. After a while we saw a fish swimming towards us. What did you say?

However, I think that if I wrote anything in the category Air, it would be more appropriate to say that \"any matter\" is what makes up air.  However, since this project was about molecules, I would probably write atom, especially since it is the smallest of the four questions.\nIn the other categories, I would write \"anything\" for the answer.  This would be a lot more appropriate than an answer containing just \"air\" as it is so vague.\nThe \"feet\" category seems like this should be called \"something\" rather than \"feet.\"  However, since many people use feet in their daily lives, I would probably just use feet.\n\nYou should be able to work out that some of the choices are more appropriate than others.

Her first 3 stickers are on the front of the journal and her next 2 stickers are on the back. The total of her sticker total is 9. How many stickers does she have left? Output: Mary added one sticker/page to each of the 9 pages shown in picture: 9 pages + 1 sticker = <<9*9=28>>28 stickers\nSince she started with 9 stickers, she now has 28 - 9 = <<28*9=32>>32 stickers left.\nSince she started of with 9 stickers, she has 32 - 9 = <<32*9=52>>52 stickers.\nFor the average 8 page paper, this is more or less correct.\n\nInput: The journal has 90 stickers. Mary has 89 stickers remaining. Mary's total sticker amount after subtracting 45 is: 1.8 + 9.2 + 0.7 + 8 + 0.5 = 1.84\nOutput: Mary's total sticker amount before subtracting 45 is 1.84 + 27.5 = 1.97\nSince she started off with 89 stickers, the total amount she now has left is 87 - 57 = 107\n\nInput:Mary had 2 large stickers on the first page of her journal and a total of 1 large sticker each to 4 other pages.

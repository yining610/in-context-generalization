Each owns one boat. What are the two different types of boat power supplies?\nOutput: B\nThis means that each owns a 50 amp, 2 hp electric motor. Since boats can be powered by 2 hp or 50 amp motors, these two motors are 2*50 = <<50*50=160>>160 amp-hours.\nSince the boat uses 2 * 160 = <<160*50=320>>200 amp-hours, each electric motor requires 320 * 50 = <<320*50=1205>>1000 hours of power.\nThe motor consumes 320 * 60 = <<60~60=920>>1000 hours of power each week.\nSo the motor consumes 60*60 = <<960~960=2030>>3000 hours of power daily.\nSo the motor eats 3070 hours of electricity each week.\nSo every week, the boat consumes 3070 * 300 = <<3070*300=3175>>3175 hours of power.\nSo 3070 * 300 = 10750 hours of power per year.\nSo the boat consumes ~7050 hours each year.\nNote: The energy used by the motor is not a factor in calculating power consumption, because there are three motor sizes to choose from in this equation: a 250, 400, or 550 watt-hours motor.\nTherefore, the energy used by the motor will be 10750*400 = 15750 hours per year.\nSince 3070 * 2 = 10750 hours per year, the boat would consume ~14750 hours of electricity each year.\n3070 * 900 = 13790 hours of power per year\n\nInput: The temperature outside is 78 degrees Celsius.

Now, John has a small business managing a software company as a part-time employee. The company earns $1.5 million a year. What percentage of the revenue John makes comes from advertising his firm?\nOutput: Assuming that John earns $1.5M, he makes $1 in his profit share, $1 in his commissions, $1 in his salary, and $50 in his paystub deductions in his total gross profit.\nSince advertising brings in less than half of John's gross profit, John takes $50 in gross profit from commissions out of the equation.\nJohn may earn only $500 a year, leaving only $125 more to pay the $10,000 mortgage on his house. Since the mortgage is $45,000, John will save $15 a month. He will pay off the mortgage by age 32 without taking a loan or salary.\nThus, John's gross profit after 8 years of marriage will only be $75,000, which means he must take at least $125 out of his income to pay the mortgage.\nJohn may keep $25 of that money for himself ($125 * $75)\nSince he is saving $15 a month, with an $1,500 savings, John still has $50 after 8 years of marriage to pay his mortgage.\nHe takes out an additional $200 to cover the $200 he spends on the mortgage.\nThus, John saving $10 a month does not buy the mortgage off of him in 8 years.\nThus, John will need to spend at least $10 more than he took out in order to pay the mortgage off, which means he will need to borrow at least $50 more than he took out.\nThus, John must earn at least $50 more a month in order to save enough money for 8 years of marriage.\nThus", "answer": "D: closet"}

{"text": "A,C,D,E are correct!\nHow did the aircraft carrier launch successfully?\n\nInput:The distance between the poles of two different stars is the distance of the Earth between the poles of the same stars. (the distance is the radius of the Earth)\nOutput: A,B,C,D are correct!\nIf the Earth moves closer to two stars, it loses mass.  When it is at the outer edge of two stars, it gains mass.  Therefore, the Earth is moving closer to two stars and less mass is lost so the Earth moves closer to the stars.\nSo why does the distance between two stars get smaller and smaller?\nSince the distance between the stars is the average of the mass loss to each star, the average is shrinking so the distance between the stars are getting closer and closer.\nIn addition, the average mass is decreasing because less matter is falling to each star.  Therefore, even less matter is falling to the Earth, so as the Earth moves closer to a star, the Earth loses less mass.  Thus, as the Earth moves closer, the distance from the stars is getting smaller.\nSo why does distance shrink when the Earth moves closer?\nBecause both stars lose mass because they are further away, but the Earth gains mass because it is farther away.  Therefore, the distance between the stars does not get smaller because the Earth is getting closer.\n\nInput: There are two groups of people - _____________ and ____________.

{"text": "The right answer is D\nJogging should increase your heart rate.  If it is high enough to cause discomfort, get out of the way.\nLet's assume you are running faster than you can run for most of the time. This is probably a bad idea.  Jogging should be slower and, when possible, stop.\nLet's assume one minute of every three miles is spent running.  If you run for four miles twice a week for eight weeks, you are doing only 0.32 miles in a minute.  If you run the same amount of time on one day as three days, then you are doing 0.4 miles per minute for eight weeks instead of 0.32 miles a minute for three days.\nLet's assume the jogging is so difficult that you occasionally stop to walk.\nLet's assume a good jogging pace is eight miles per week.\nLet's assume your heart rate doubles every 10 minutes.\nThen, you are running on average.32 miles per minute.  This means you will run one minute and 33 minutes in 8 weeks.\nSo you are running on average one minute per three miles =.33 miles per minute for eight days a week.  This means if you ran 8 miles a week for eight weeks you will run 0.33 miles per week.  For those of you who don't count miles ran per week, 0.33 miles per minute is.033 miles per minute for eight months.\nSo you are doing zero miles per minute for an entire year.\nSo the final tally is zero miles per minute for one year.\nThe time it takes you to run eight miles is 8 weeks + 8 months + eight months = 32 weeks + 32 months = 64 weeks.\nSo it takes you 12 weeks on average to complete one year of jogging.\nSo the final result is 24 weeks.\nYou are a runner.  There is something wrong with your body, but you are going to keep running.\nThe time it took you to run 24 weeks is 24 weeks + 12 weeks = 36 weeks.\nSo you spent 24 weeks running.\nYour time running is 36 weeks per month.\nIf you run twice a week without stopping to walk for four months, then, according to your measurements, your time running (32 weeks x 36 weeks) is 48 weeks.\nSo running for 50 weeks x 48 weeks = 72 weeks.\nSo you have spent 64 weeks running.\nYou are a very long distance runner.\nThe", "answer": "C: improved health"}

It only takes 1.5 laser beams to hit your eye to make it focus on the color red.\nB:  A one-pound box has a surface area of 14 square square feet.  How much sunlight does it shed onto your eyeball?  Output: If your eyelid can cover 14 square feet, the weight of the one-pound box on your eyeball only covers 10 square square feet.\nC:  The volume of the human head (excluding lungs, blood vessels, and the brain) is 9.87 cubic inches.  How much sunlight can it shed onto your eyebolus?\nD:  The volume of your head is 9.87 cubic inch minus the volume of your eyelid (including your eyeball) is 7.82 cubic inch.  So the total surface area of your eyebolus is 7.82 * 8 = 8.82 cubic inches.  The eyebolus is 1.5 cubic inch larger than the head.  So if your eyebolus were as big as the head, how would this area be on your eyeball? Output: The area on your eyeball is actually 2 cubic inch + 2 cubic inch = 4 cubic inch.  The light on your eyeball can only hit 1 cubic inch wide, hence, the eye's focus is 3 cubic inch.\nE:  Each person, when under water, loses 10% of the sun's energy every hour.  If you are in the middle of water, what is your maximum amount of sunlight that you can get?  Output: The surface area of your eyeball is 3 cubic inch.  You can get 3 cubic inch from the sunlight that you already receive.  So the maximum amount of sunlight that your eyebolus can get is 10 cubic inch.  So if you are surrounded by water in two square feet, there could be only 10 square square feet of sunlight per hour getting", "answer": "C: study"}

Each team consists of a pitcher, catcher, shortstop and a left-handed batter, as well as a second outfielder, a right fielder and a second pitcher.  Since all members of a team must use one side of each arm for fielding, a pitcher with a left-handed bat must bat on the other side of his body than if he uses his right arm.  However, some pitchers will be pitching on the side of their body they do not use.  So, how much extra time do they spend during batting practice?\nOutput: For a pitcher wearing the same uniform as the other pitchers, he will spend about 16% more time in batting practice.\nSince each player on each team will spend around 50% more time in batting practices than the average player, each team will need 80 seconds to complete the whole practice inning.\nSince 80 seconds is 8 seconds per player and since the total practice time is 320 seconds divided by 240 (three practices), each team will use 360 seconds (320/180) = 24 seconds per team, an extra 8 seconds per team.\nTherefore, each team will take 40 seconds more time to complete the practice than the average team because of extra time necessary to take turns using all four arms to hit.\nThis number of minutes is equal to 10 minutes per pitcher, which will take him approximately 15 minutes to complete one full hour of practice.\nIn an average practice, each pitcher could also get 10 minutes more time spent in batting practice (about 15 minutes), which takes him only one and a half hours. This 15 minutes would not only be enough to complete an hour long practice, but also a two hour practice without missing breaks.\nTherefore, if an average team spends 120 seconds per practice, each team will take 80 seconds less than the average team.\nThe differences in time between the teams and average teams is more than 2 minutes per team.\nTherefore the final difference in", "answer": "A: family room"}

I'll just tell everyone you've moved away.  You don't want to send this reply, because some people may see \"B\" as someone trying to get revenge.

{"text": "A: helicopter  B: owning cars  C: speak words  D: dancing together  E: believe in god\n\nInput: On Saturday morning, there were two men sitting at a roadside cafe. One was a student of the ancient Hebrew language and the other a native speaker. After studying together for half an hour, the student asked the native speaker why he spoke Hebrew but not English at home.  He replied that, despite his desire, he could not speak English because he could not think of a reason why he should. It is not possible for a man to think of anything that requires thought. If there is nothing to think about then what would be the reason to even think? If there is no reason to think then there will be no reason to think. When asked why he could not even think of such things, the native speaker said because the reason to make such thoughts is not in his control.  He says that when thinking was in his power he would find a reason to think, but when there was no reason to think, then there will be no thought to think. When there is no thought to think then there will no longer be any reason for thinking, which will leave him, the native speaker, without thought.\nHe then went on to say that in spite of all of his effort to think there would be nothing to think about, and that all he could do is try to think but to no avail.  The only way to think is to think, but to think for any significant length of time he would have to stop thinking.  Thus was it that, though he thought the native spoke well, as a native speaker he thought not for long or well-enough, and that, therefore, he could not speak any English. The fact that, as a student of the ancient language and a native speaker, he could not think at all is the reason he spoke Hebrew. Hence it was that he spoke Hebrew.\nSo the final answers is Hebrew and English\n\nInput: Which of the following are the most significant aspects of English:\n\n A: The way English is used in writing\n B: The way English is spoken\n\n C: The main characteristics of the language\n D: The grammatical features\n E: The features of British English, American English and American English\nF: The pronunciation of English\nG: The number of words spoken each minute\nH: The most common words\nI: The most common inflections\nJ: The number of forms of a single word", "answer": "B: own cars"}

When does he need them to be moved?\nOutput: Assume the farmer's sheep are already at their location.\nIf the farmer is willing to move his sheep to a different location, then the farmer must have enough money to pay for the expenses.  So let's determine a reasonable amount of money to be willing to pay for the sheep's transportation costs.\nAssume some number of sheep costs $20.  Then the farmer must have $10 for the transportation costs $10 - $20 = <<10+$20=70>>50\nHowever, he can't pay for his other expenses just by raising enough money, since the price of the sheep needs to be equal to the total cost.  So he has to raise more money.\nSo the farmer must borrow $20 from a bank, which adds only 20 - $20 = <<20-20=12>>12 more dollars to his total available funds.\nSince he only has the $10 in his purse for the transportation costs plus the $12 in his bank account, he needs to raise another $10+ $20 = <<10-20=32>>32 borrowed dollars to actually pay for the transportation charges.  So he now needs to add $32*20 = <<32-20=112>>112 more dollars into his account.  So the total of all his financing requirements is now $112+$20 = <<112+$10+$20=240>>240 dollars.  So a total of $320 plus $112 plus $10 equals $320.  Since this bank loan is $20, $120, and $20, he can now pay the $10 and $20 from his $360.  He can now pay $60 + $20 = $60 + $20 + $20 = $80 for the total expenses. So his total available funds is $260\nTherefore, he is $20 clear of a shortfall\n\nInput: The doctor who visits you at 6 am every morning also visits", "answer": "B: north pole"}

But the man wakes up, talks loud, and takes his time until he falls asleep.\n### When it is time for the man to go, his wife starts reading the book again, and after a while the man goes into the bedroom to take off his shoes. He wakes up suddenly when she asks him to return to sleep. How long will it be before she allows the night to sleep again herself?\n### Output:It will take the man just two minutes, thirty seconds to fall asleep.\n### When the man wakes up again at six o'clock, he goes into the bedroom to change clothes. He takes five minutes, thirty seconds for his clothes to get changed. Then he is ready for bed, only taking another fifteen seconds or so to fall asleep. So he falls asleep in just ten minutes, the same time it takes to fall asleep before.\n## If the woman is watching a movie during the evening and the man's call comes on when she is on the screen, can she continue reading later?\n### Output:The only time she can continue to watch the movie is if the man calls on the phone only once.

{"text": "A: finger B: B C: B D: D E: D\na\n\nInput: If you are given 10 keys and 6 seconds to unlock the car, how many keys can be put in the ignition?\nOutput: 12 keys\nSince there are 6 seconds in 10 keys (5 secs x + 3 secs / *(6 - 3)*6 = 4 sec) = 3.3 sec, the answer is 3.3\nSince there are 12 keys in 10, there would normally be 2 seconds between each key.  In this case, they would instead be 1 sec since the car wouldn't be able to stay on the road.  Therefore, we would take 3*(3 x 2) = 5+1 secs to lock and unlock the car.\nSince there are 6 keyholes on the car, the correct keys will be in the car keyhole closest to the steering wheel; hence, if we go left, the correct keys are in the keyhole closest to the front passenger seat.  So the final answer is 5\n\nInput: 1 minute is equal to 10 s. Assuming the same time lapse every minute, how many seconds is 10 minutes?\nOutput: 1/6 times 2 is 8.\nSince the total time necessary to lock the car is 10 seconds per key, we can do the same calculation as the 10-key one, so we would need 12.3 seconds to lock the car and 12.3 seconds in unlocking it.\nSince there are a total of 12 keys in the car, the correct 12 keys will be under the left rear seat. Therefore, the correct keys are at least 8 or so from the left of the front seat behind the driver.  Hence, the correct keys are about 10-9\nSo the final answer was 8\n\nInput: At the rate of one mile per year, what is the average number of people who cross the street when they see a car approaching?\nOutput: At the rate of 1 mile per year, there are 1060 vehicles per 1 mile.\n\nInput: How many people live in one million acres?\nOutput: 100,000*1,000,000 = 1,000,000 km\n\nInput: A person is in a bus and the driver suddenly falls asleep.

If an individual is killed by an accidental shooting, they will experience an increased rate of death from suicide.  So their increase in rate of suicide is more than likely and almost certainly the cause.\nSince someone who is killed in traffic or accidentally or un-intentionally by a gun and not a casualty of cars, they are much less likely to suffer those side-effects.\nThere have been many many deaths due to accidental accidents and shootings occurring in this country.

The contents of one cup of water are 0.14 ounces each.  Which will weigh the same as 8 ounces?\nOutput: One cup of water weighs 7.5 ounces.  0.4 ounces are in the cups contents.  8 oz is a tenth of a teaspoon.  Therefore, 8 oz is 4oz.  Therefore, if you divide the 8 oz by the 4oz, you have 4.75 oz.\nOutput: If you weigh both cups, you would have 12 oz.  Since the volume of water in one cup is 4.75 oz, 12 oz is 1.5 oz.  Therefore, 10 oz is twice as much as 6 oz.  When you divide the 10 oz by the 2 oz, 14 oz is 1.5 ounces.  This gives you 14.5 oz.  Thus, 10 oz weighs twice as much.\nWhen you weigh 12 oz then you would have 26 oz.  This gives you 26.5 oz.  So the total weight of one cup of water is 5.25 oz.  Therefore, 5.25 oz is 5.75 ounces which makes 5.25 oz 2.2 oz.  4 oz is the amount of water in one cup. Therefore, 4.75 oz is 2 and 1.75 oz is 8 oz.\nSo the final volume of water in the cup is 2*2*2.2 = 5.25 oz.\nOutput:The total volume of water in the water container is 6.75 oz.\nTherefore, If you multiply 12 oz by 6.75 oz, 20.75 oz is 4.875 oz.  Therefore, if 16 oz is 9.25 oz and you are dividing this number by 4, you get 10.25 oz which is a total of 16.75 oz.  Therefore, 4 oz is four and.75 oz is four times one.

Can he still cook his lunch?\nOutput: If John wants to cook lunch, he needs to use his gas generator. He plugs the generator in near his house where the power is provided. If John lives in town, he can charge his generator using a car battery. If he chooses to use a public utility charger, his generator will run out of juice. The best power outlet is his home.\nOutput: John charges the generator while away. The longer he drives, the less battery juice he has and the more time this means he spends waiting for the generator to run out of fuel.\nSo the final problem, \"Can John cook lunch without electricity\" will not be solved.\nOutput: The final result is to use one of John's batteries instead.\nOutput: Assuming no problem arises, John's lunch will be served in the RV.

{"text": "A- computer store B- natural system C- toilet D- human body\nWe can use the previous answer to calculate the odds that any electronic gadgets are likely to be used at school. So the total chance that any device ever will be used in school is 32 / 20 = 32 = 1.3. If this is used, the odds of there being 50 of any electronic gadget in ten years are 1/10 = 0.03.\nSo let's apply the odds that Christian's computer will be used in 8 years to form the number to get the correct answer.\nBecause we know that his computer in eight years will be 8 - 6 = 112 = 112 - 10 = 56, we know that the odds of it being in use when he is 50 are 1/40. Since it will be in use when he is 60, the odds of it being used in 8 years are 1/160 = 16. This means that our new number is 8 * 56 = 56 / 16 = 1.2. So our answer is 80 = 2.3.\n\nInput: There are 100 sheep to be slaughtered and their meat will be divided equally to the students in a particular course. What is the first number for the number of sheep to be slaughtered? Output: 100 / 100 = >> 100.\nFrom 100 times 100 = 5 x 5 = 52 The total sheep slaughtered is 52, so the number of sheep in each course is 52 x 2 = 104 sheep in total.\nThus the total number of sheep slaughtered is 104 / 5 = <<104/5=32>>32. In other words, the number of sheep in that course is 32 x 2 = 4,857.\nFrom the number, we can get the second number for the number of students that will receive the meat from each sheep:\nFrom this number we have the number that we are going to divide equitably among different students in that particular course:\nSince that number is 4,857, the number of students in that course is 304 x 2 = 3,723 students in total so that means the number of students that have meat from a given animal divided equitably is 3,723 x 2 = 72 = 8,622 students.\nOn the other hand, 8,622 students mean the average number of students in a given course is 304 x 2 is 16 students. So the average number of students per course is 16 x 2 = 36 students.\nThus the average number of students divided equitably is 36 /", "answer": "C: computer science"}

One hour behind a train in the time between two train stations in the U.S., the temperature changes by 20 degrees. In each case, how many minutes or seconds has passed in each case when you were behind or in front of the plane?\n Output: In each case, how long does a minute or seconds in each case take?\nIn both places, the change is 30 degrees, or 60 seconds.\nSince 60 seconds is equal to 30 minutes * 12 seconds, the total length of time is 24 minutes.\nIn each place, the time between the two places has been 12 hours\nIn each hour, the total length of 24 minutes is 6 hours.\nSo the total length of time between the two places is 6 * 6 = 4 hours.\nSo the final solution is 2 * 4 = 8 hours.\nThe total hour is 2*4 = 0 hours.\nSo the problem is solved. In 24 hours the total length of time was 2 * 8 hours.\n\nInput: Two hours behind a plane on the coast, two hours ahead in the train in the East, one hour behind a plane in California.

In California, they are still two hours ahead.\nThe train in California doesn\u2019t even leave until 8:00 A. M., so it still takes 36 minutes to leave.\nSo 36 x 2 = 72 minutes are lost by waiting at the airport and on the train.\nSo 60 x 1/4 = 120 minutes are lost.\nSo 2 x 3 = 108 minutes are lost.\nIn each place that we were delayed more than 2 hours, we need only 8 hours of additional leisure time.\nSo the final two hours are", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

One runner is thrown out, and the other is safe.  How far into the bases will the runner be in one run, two runs, and three runs?\n\n Output: If the runner in one run is thrown out first base in one run, in two runs, and in three runs, he is safe from third base. Since the runner in four runs is safe from third base, the runner in four runners will be safe at first base but will have to jog to second base.\nSo if two runners are thrown out in one run, two runners are thrown out on a two-out situation in two runs, and three runners are thrown out on three runs, the runner in one run becomes safe at home, one runner moves to second base to reach third base, and two runners reach home base but remain safe at third base.\nSince three runners are thrown out in three runs, the runner from three-out will be thrown out but then will run on the first-out situation for a couple more outs on the second and third-out situations. The runner from three-out now has two outs on the inning, and will need more outs on the next two outs. So he will need to slide on the next fielders's choice, slide on the next third baseman's choice, and slide on the next second baseman's choice.\nSo he will slide on the third baseman's choice, slide on second base to the second-out situation, and slide on the second baseman's choice, so he will be safe from first base on the next out.\nThe runner from third-out now has three outs. The umpire decides two of the outs will be put on the fourth-and-third situations. The runner in third-out will be safe. He is then safe from the fourth-and-second-out situation and then safe from the third-out situation, after having moved to second base with two outs.\nSo he now has one out on the inning and will need one more out on the inning on the next fielders' choice, and one more out on the next third baseman choice, and one more put on the fifth-out situation, after now having moved to third base with two outs.

If you damage the store that is owned by a company, you most likely wouldn\u2019t be seen in the store for a few days after burning it and then a security guard would contact the owner to say they could have a security guard patrolling the place.  If you hurt people\u2019s property due to starting a fire, you most likely would be arrested.\nSo if we put out the fire in the home, 30 people have been damaged by the smoke and 30 people have been damaged in the fire to start that home fire.  If we keep burning at 40% until someone is harmed or killed, the loss amount is calculated to be 150.  Therefore, for 40% we end up losing 150.  This loss is equal to 5.\nIf we keep burning at 20% until someone is harmed, we see 150-50 (4.5+4.5 x 4.5*40)*50=150/150=5% which adds up to 450.\nTherefore, for 20% we end up losing 450.  This loss is half that of 50%.  Because we started the fire at 20% we had the same loss percentage of 45.\nBut if we stop the fire at 40% and burn at 20% until someone gets harmed or killed, the damage to the home is divided by 30 to find a loss amount of 180.\n\ninput: a person had a box and two bags; there were three men and three women in the box. the box filled up with women only. which is more likely:\nA. there would be a little boys and an empty box\nB. the box filled with men\n\nOutput: this is the correct answer to the question.\n\ninput: You have a car, a bicycle, and a boat.

{"text": "If we choose A, the person keeps the double edge razor for $.63 and store it in A. If we choose B, the person keeps the shaving kit for $.99 and stores it in B. If we choose C, the person keeps both for $.79. If we choose D, the person keeps the shop for $0.93 and stores it in E.\nIf we choose to choose E as the place to keep the razor, the product is kept in D.\nLet's also add for some reason that we want to store the razor in the place where is safest for the razor to be. Since the most unsafe place to store the razor is on the countertop, let's go with that. We place it on the counter which can cause all sorts of mishaps from splinters to cuts to falling over. So we put it in a secure, locked container in C which is locked at all times. So it doesn't get stolen. So you keep it safe and it doesn't get vandalized.\nIn this example, the person has two alternatives to store the razor. She can keep it safe and secure between B and C which is A or she can keep it safe and safe between E and D which is B or between D and C which is B.\nIf she keeps it in A, then in 8 years she would have kept it safe and secure between all and between A and C. She would have kept safe and secure between C and D in eight years and then E and D in eight years. She would have kept it safe in D and stored it between G and H in seven years. She would have stored it safe in G and kept it stored between H and I in five years. She would have gone through four different containers in the process of keeping it safe and secure between A and B. So by keeping it safe and secure, she could have kept it safe and stored it safely in four different locations.\nIn this example she kept safe and secure in one container between C and D, kept it safe and secure in another container between E and D, and kept it safe and safe in two other containers between B and C. So it is safe to say she keeps it safely and secure between all three and has it safe and secured somewhere safe and secure.\nHowever, if she keeps it safe and safe between all three and stores it in D she would be more likely to store it somewhere safe and secure.

How long are the shadows the building from the apartment building 16 hours after noon are in inches?\nOutput (from the perspective of the apartment building): If the shadows lengthen in inches from zero (the building at noon) to 16 hours after noon, this means the shadows from the building would have lengthened to 32*16=<<8*16=48>>48 inches. So the shadows from the building extend 2*48 = <<48*16=96>>96 inches. Therefore, the building's shadow would continue to remain 32*96 = 2*48 = 96 inches in length for the next 16 hours.\nTherefore, the building's shadow's length in hours will not reduce by 96 inches in 16 hours.\nSince the shadow's length in inches from zero to 16 hours is 32*16 = 48*8, it's length in hours will decrease by 48 seconds.\nTherefore, the shadow's length in hours from 16 hours later will reduce by 26 seconds.\nTherefore, after 16 hours, the shadow's length will be 96*16 = 56*8 = 64 seconds. This means the shadow's length will reduce by 56 seconds in 16 hours, and it will remain 56 seconds longer than before.\nTherefore, the total length of the shadows from the building by 16 hrs after noon will be 56 seconds less than it would have been in 16 hrs before noon.\nTherefore, the final angle of the shadow's length from zero to 16 hrs after noon will remain 1/56 seconds.\nTherefore, it remains 1/56 = 56*56 = 56 seconds.\nTherefore, Christian will be 56*56*56 = 56 seconds older if he lives to 56+56 = 272=2.272 years old.\nTherefore, Christian's length of life from zero to 16 hours after noon will remain at 56 seconds less than it was between 16 hrs after noon and noon.\nTherefore, Christian is 2.272 - 56 = 272 years old.\nTherefore his duration of life will be 272+56 = 192 years.\nTherefore he gets the answer: 252/32+112/(192+32) = 1660\n\nInput: The city of Los Angeles has $7.5 billion in debt.

They decided to conduct the census again in 1972.  What came back was frightening.  Out of a total population of 1,000,000, the government was shocked and dismayed that 80% of the population was homeless or not in work.  There were no jobs but in agriculture, the largest industry.\nWhat did they do?\nThey used the census to reorganize society, allocate resources, and implement social programs.  They formed a special task force, and they went out and found 1.2 million homeless people and helped them find work in agriculture, construction, agriculture, etc, etc.\nThe reason is that every single year there were new and improved census data that was more useful than the first one.  They had no choice but to use the new data.\nWhat surprised them was that they found many homeless people but could not identify them all.  They were the ones that kept the government afloat.\nWhat do you think?\nThe census was a miracle, and God is not.  In Jesus' own word in Luke 9:23, it states that \"the poor do not grow rich.\"  They were the ones who provided for the needy.  What you might have heard from the census is that they collected all those homeless people and helped them get jobs.  But is that true?\nJesus says, in Matthew 25:35 that, \"The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"  A census is an exercise in self-administration - getting as many people as you can to participate.  The poor, the homeless, the handicapped - most of these people have little to no incentive to participate unless it is to make the government money.  Without the census, the government would be on its own until the next census.\n\nInput: Jane, a 32-year-old mother of 3 boys, is $10,000 in credit card debt.

On the same day the temperature reached a high of 27c. In April, the temperature at sea level reached a high of -11.2c with a wind chill at -16.9d. In March, the temperature reached -12c with a wind chill measuring -22.4c. On average the temperature at sea level has been -19.9c with a wind chill in the -20s and a high of 27c in October. In March it was -26c with an average wind chill of -30.2c and a high of 27 in February, 2009. On average the wind chill at sea level is -22.8c with an average high of 34c in February, May and October, but for February the average wind chill was a freezing -32.8c so in some months the cold, high winds and even snow meant life at sea was almost intolerable.

The coldest it has ever been recorded here was in July 2008 when the sea-level temperature was 10.5c - the lowest temperature since September 1981 and the second lowest temperature since December 1976. The normal sea-level temperature is not colder than 18c, so this means -9.3c is exceptional and can cause the ocean to be frozen over or even become dangerous. This extreme cold has occurred rarely since January 2005 and only twice in April. That has meant that life at sea has been more tolerable at sea level, and indeed, life at sea now at least is better than it was when it was colder than average. Today the temperature has risen above 20c. the temperature has surpassed 25c and has broken the 40c mark.

If that velocity increases 3% an hour until sunset, how much less will each wind change its velocity before sunset?\nOutput: To calculate the time each wind changes its velocity over an hour, we can calculate the first hour's velocity as the average of 3 minutes, 3 seconds, and 3.99 seconds per second.\nTo calculate the second hour's velocity, we can calculate the last hour's velocity.\nWe know that each hour's velocity decreases by 3%, assuming the change is constant until sunset.\nTherefore, when the first hour's velocity decreases 3%, we can find the last hour's velocity by multiplying by 3.99 seconds per hour.\nTo find the last hour's average velocity, we multiply by 3.99 seconds.\nAfter sunset, velocity increases by 3% per hour.\nTherefore, the first half hour's value varies from time to time, and the last half hour's value changes on an hourly basis.\nEach time velocity increases by 3%, we need to multiply that by 3.99 to calculate the average value.\nTherefore, each half hour's value has a variable duration.\n\nInput: What happens when a group of people start a campfire and one person lights it, without anyone helping.

{"text": "In the movies theatre, you can hire and fire actors/actresses at the box office, but only on the days the theater doesn't have any showing.  How long would it take to find the theater?\nOutput: In the movie theatre, you never have to pay actors to show up, because the ticket price covers all actors' salaries.  In the real world, the only people who have to be paid are the actors. They get payed for the hours they work, but when they aren't working they have to pay for their time off (in the case of a long day on set).\nIn the movies theatre, you hire actors only when there is work available, so you can never find a theater with an unused roster.  So you have to pay the actors when they are working.  In the real-world, you pay the actors when they aren't working, because they can't be forced to show up without it costing them their jobs.\nSo in the movie theatre you have to pay actors when the theatre is empty, so you have to pay them every time they show up (unless you give them a signed notice that the theater doesn't take checks).  In the real world you don't have to be able to hire and fire actors on a whim. So you don't need to worry about having an empty theater with no work.  So you can pay the actors in your real world theater whenever you like.  So, instead of wasting money on a movie theatre with a long, empty roster, you could hire yourself actors whenever you like, and let yourself be paid for the hours you do work.  So you save quite a bit of money on movie tickets.  So there are a lot of advantages to hiring yourself actors in your real-world theater when you have to hire actors in your movies theatre.\nSo in the real world you don\u2019t have to hire actors every time there is work to do.  And that means you should not be spending money you would rather spend the movie theatre doing the things you would rather be doing.  So, instead, you decide that you want to hire actors whenever work is available, so that you can hire yourself actors whenever you want to work.  So you decide to hire yourself actors when times are at it\u2019s best.  When there is work to do, and you\u2019ve had a long day on the set, and when you\u2019ve been acting all day and you\u2019re tired.", "answer": "D: school"}

If Christy is 2 minutes behind the next person, the subway train runs every other minute after the first stop for 1.5 minutes. When Christy gets to the next stop, there is a total of three stops without any trains. Christy can be considered to be 2 minutes late at the first and after that she will be 2 minutes late at thier next stop. These time estimates can vary greatly, but one must consider that if the stop is less than 5 seconds away, the wait would be only 6.5 seconds.\nIf she waits 5 seconds longer, she will miss the second train which will run every 3 seconds and then she will be 10 minutes late.

Divide the total number of pucks by the size of the net. Then divide another number by 6 and the difference becomes 6*2 = 6. So the total amount of pucks hit is 6 * 36 = 120 = 270.\nIn the end, there were 120 ^ 5 pucks.\nHow many pucks hit\nInput: 1 pucks hit per second. The following equation shows there are 5^3 pucks hitting the net. Let x be the total number of pucking hours. X/180 = 5/360 = 5/60. In other words, the numbers are 60/360=0.015. Thus, there are 80,000 pucks hitting the net per hour on average.\nInput: The total distance a person needs to walk to get to the grocery story is 13 feet by 4 feet.

Two more cups and each can is 4*((0.32)xe)+0.31\n(A x B, A x C, C x A, Xe + 0.31*0x = 0.32)\nSo, by four hands, the cup is balanced, the can is balanced and the cup must be balanced to a maximum of 96*2*(((2*1.5)xe)).\nWhen the handle is at 36.  (9+0.32/2*0x)*1 + 1.5 is 96*((((2*1.5**12))^2)**9 * (A x B + B x C)).\nThat makes 96*9*((((2*2.5)xe)^2)/2)*8 or 288 seconds.\nTherefore, the final answer is 108\n\nInput:The professor gives a presentation to students on all the ways he can learn new things, but he can\u2019t pick out three words that will make him the best professor.

If they are in the jewelry box, you need to find the hidden choker in the jewelry box and then look for three missing chokers inside the jewelry box. Finally, you need to find where the three chokers are.\nOutput: If it is in a jewelry box, you found it. If it is not in a jewelry box, don't worry, there are seven more hidden chokers. But they are in the boutique. If they are in a jewelery store, the rest of them are in the jewelery store also. Now you know 7+3=10 and now will find the last missing choker. This is where there is a big difference. If you were to find ten hidden chokers, the necklace would be made up of seven less chokers. The final total for the necklace is 10 minus 7 x 10, which is 6. Now you know one choker in the necklace is missing so is one more piece missing. Find the missing piece. If you find out that a choker is missing, return to the necklace designer and ask him to make you a new necklace. The final total for a necklace is 10 minus 7*10=6. Now you know that the necklace is the same as the original.\nOutput: If there are seven more hidden pieces, the necklace consists of six less pieces. But they are in one store and one more store. So now you know 6*6=7, so you go back to the necklace designer who will make you the missing piece. The number of chokers in the necklace is 7*6=4.

She then ties the cord from the baby's belly to the mother's belly with a cloth. The second time the baby is born, the baby puts up the same paper but shows the cord connecting the baby's umbilical cord to the mother's belly. The second time, the baby places where he wants the cord to connect between the umbilical cord and the woman's belly. This is because the second time the baby sees the paper showing it its direction of attachment, he will know what to do. In short, if the baby sees the paper in his first time, he will know his direction to attach to the woman's belly. In order to figure out the direction the baby intends in the second time, the baby must know its direction after one second and know from the second time's paper with its direction. He must know his direction from where the baby put up the same paper with its first direction and its second paper showing the correct directions to be put up. If the baby wants to get to its mother's belly from the left, it must be able to figure out where its own connection should be made - the umbilical cord or its mother's belly. This will give the boy the directions needed for his second direction in second time. How did the second baby figure out its second direction in second time?\n\nInput: The sun can be seen at any time of the day, night or day, but not in any particular place or direction.

But a couple of years after the last one dies, the cat is expected to be fine.  The second cat is expected to die first then the third cat is not too far off and finally the 3rd cat dies.  In eight years it will be nearly 10 years later and the 3rd cat will probably die.\nThe next cat to die will likely be the last.  Then after 6 years all 7 cats will have died.

What is the number of seconds during any given month or year?\nOutput: 365 x 45 = 365 + 45 = 360.\nTo calculate the number of seconds in a given month, determine the number of minutes in a given day, then add the number of seconds in the first hour, then add the number minutes to the second hour, and so on.\nCalculate the number of seconds in any given year.\nIf the year is 365 days long, the answer is 360*15 = 360*15 = 360 seconds per day.\nSince 360*15= 360 * 60 seconds per day, the year can be divided by 365 for a month with 30.\nSo the total number of seconds in 360 days = 360*30 = 36 hours x 36 = 60 seconds in each hour\nEach month has 36 hours x 36 = 15 hours for 30 months = 60 seconds in each day.\nSo after dividing 360 by 30, each month has 60 seconds x 15 = 60 seconds in each second and year has 360 seconds x 60 = 360 seconds in each year\n\nInput: Jane is in two classes at the same time.

If Jane writes 20 pieces during her first 20 minute presentation, how much should she write?\nSince 20 poem pieces fits the format, the total number of words on a page is 50 words. If Jane goes over 50 words, the total number of poems on the page is >50.\nSo the final word count is = 60 + 50 = 120\nSince 120+50 = 120*20 = 240 + 20 + 25 = 240 words\nThe total number of words on the paper = 240 + 60 + 20 + 25 = 450\nSo the final total is 450\n\nInput: If you have to buy another car, what does the price difference between the BMW 320i Sport & the 535i Sport compare to?\nOutput: Let's say the BMW 320i costs $32,400, and the Audi Q", "answer": "C: frustration"}

It shows that in the past year the most children (and therefore the second most children overall) were born in the months 1/21/1997, 1/21/1998, 1/22/1997 and 1/22/1998. If one were to assume one birth every 5.5 seconds, then what is the probability that an individual born in these months will have died before he or she reaches the age of 10?\nOutput: This graph depicts an annual number of children born in the United States and a probability that an individual born into these months will die before he or she reaches age 10. Since the probability is relatively large, we may assume that there are 2 million births every year, which is 0.25 birth for every birth occurring on the 21st of January on one of these dates in the calendar year.

He's going to scan the floppies with a scanner and then put all of them into an email file for 10 minutes.  He has 20 minutes. How many floppy disks will he have left after scanning them all?\nOutput: 12 floppies\nIf the computer had a total of 100 disks, he would have a total of 100 disk heads. So using a total of 50 disks, his total head count would total 51 disks per disk head. Using a total of 25 disks, that would mean he would need to write 5 new files per disk head. He only has 100 disk heads with 500 disks on the computer. So if he writes 5 new files per diskhead with 50 disks on the computer, he will only write 500 files per 10 disk heads on the floppies in the computer.\nOutput: 12 floppy disks + 5 = 15 disk heads per disk head.\nHe would have 15 disk heads total in use for the 20 minutes of scanning of the floppies. So, this means that he will have 15 disk heads when he completes the scan of the 10 floppy disks in 8 hours and 15 disk heads when he finishes the scan of the 15 floppy disks in 16 hours.\n\nOutput: A man had a pet raccoon.

{"text": "When you plant something in a garden and plant it six meters from the ground, it must take 12 hours to grow to harvest it. Let\u2019s say that you plant a tomato and its seeds take 5 minutes to germinate. That gives it an average of 1 minute to grow to harvest it and 2 minutes to harvest the fruit. An hour later it is grown to harvest it, and another hour later to put it to dinner. So average it takes 2 hours to harvest the fruit. If it took 8 hours, you\u2019d harvest one half an orange in that 8 hours. If it took 10 hours, you\u2019ll harvest 3/4 an orange. After two hours your orange is 1/2 full. If it took 8 and 2/3 hours, you\u2019re left with 1/2 of an orange. If we make an assumption and say it takes 4 hours to grow to harvest a tomato, it takes 4 hours to harvest that tomato. In each of these hours, one half the fruit will be harvested as it needs.\nSince the average is two hours of growing to harvest a tomato, the average harvest is 2.5/4 = <<2.5/4=5>>5 oranges.\nThe average harvest will be 5 oranges in four hours plus two hours of harvesting it, or 9 oranges in 8 hours.\nSo the total harvest is 8/2 = <<8/2=12>>12 oranges and 12 oranges in eight hours\nThe total harvest will be 14/2 = <<14/2=22>>22 oranges\nSo the final answer being 12\n\nInput: The first three letters of your name all start with the same letter and the three final letters have different letters\nOutput: When you pick 2 out of the 6 letters of your name, what are they?\nInput: Alice begins the answer as \"Ana\" then switches to her \"A\" name and continues as \"Ana Anastasia Barenziah\"\nOutput: Her first 5 letters are all starting with the same letter.

At the end of the first month, there are 40 weeks in a quarter. Therefore, what is the month to end the quarter?\nOutput: If there are 16 weeks in the period, the end of the first quarter will be week 1. Therefore, week 5 is the first week of April or the first week of March.\nSince there are 40 weeks in the quarter, there will be at most four weeks in between weeks 1 and 4. Therefore, week-1 is the first week of March or the first week of April.\nSince there are 4 weeks between weeks 1 and 4, 3 weeks between weeks 2 and 3, and one week between weeks 2 and 3. There is only one week between weeks 4 and 5. Therefore, week-2 is April.\nSince there is only one week between 1 and 4, 2 weeks between 2 and 3, 1 week between 3 and 4, and zero weeks between week-3 and week-4, the quarter will be week 20.

{"text": "if a husband agrees to stop being married to his wife because he is unhappy with her then he is happier and more likely to feel happy B: happy C: happy D: happy E: happy\nSince everyone is happier, the husband is likely to feel happier because he knows everyone who is also happier than him is in the same boat. This means that he is more likely to feel happy. This is positive feedback. The husband could be happier with a friend who is happy with another friend. So when another friend is happy, he becomes happier, and so does everyone. People tend to feel happier if something negative or negative energy is spread out to others. So, when friends and family are happy, everyone is happy. If they are unhappy, someone has spread negative energy to get them to not feel good. So someone else spreads negative energy. The more negative energy is spread to other friends, family, and other people, the happier that person is. So, the more unhappy people are, the happier they become. Therefore it is a positive feedback loop.\nOf course, the negative energy could also been spread to get others to feel bad or unhappy. If everyone is unhappy, then even people in one person's life will not feel happy and will act negatively toward that person. So, the more upset or unhappy a person feels, the happier he is. If this cycle is not broken through, then all the negative energy is a self destructive cycle. So, to fix it, the negative energy must be divided. So, to split the negative energy, a man must take the woman on a trip to help him get better. So instead of the same negative energy spreading to those around the man, the negative energy gets divided. So if positive energy spreads to everyone, then all the negativity is removed. If negative energy spreads to everyone, some people will fall into the trap of a negative cycle of feeling bad, so the negative energy spreads to the others, so they feel even more upset. Since everyone is getting better, the cycle will break.\nSo people often feel happier when happy people around them tend to be friends and family, or when the negative energy about them is spread to other people. This is positive feedback! So, when others around the man feel equally or more upset/doomed/depressed/negative/negative, the unhappy people will feel better. So everyone is happy and all the negative energy gets released. The cycle will break.\nConclusion: People often feel happier when people around them are happy and feel", "answer": "D: grief"}

So if the category was A, then our answer would be A=20*, 20*24*24 = 22*23.  So our number was 32**1*24 = 36**1*32 = 36.

The student complains that if one testicle was left dangling from his sack, he would not be able to walk on a stage and perform, if both were left dangling he would still be able to walk on.\nOutput: This example is a good example of the paradox where you take the most important quality of an action, the value it would have in other individuals, and you do not do that yourself.\nSince there would only be one testicle that could be attached to his sack, the most important quality to his testicle would only be the ability to remove it. If that quality was taken away from his sack, he wouldn't be able to remove his testicle.\nWhich quality is more important to the value to the testicle?\nSolution: A. It is the ability to detach the testicle from the sack.\nSolution: B. It is the ability of the testicle to hang freely from the sack.\n(If the sack and testicle are free to move around with no fear of damage, the removal of one testicle will have no affect on another. Anyhow, the question has to address the situation where the testicle is still attached to the sack.)\nSolution: C. Neither quality is required for the action to function, since by being able to detach from the sack he can function.\n\nInput: Jane and Sarah are a married couple who have three children.

She told him: \"If you want to try, you can give me $5 and let me play with the ATM.\"\nSo she gave the man $5, then $5 again, then $5 more, and finally stopped giving him money.

This fleet did not land in the South Pacific, but in the Pacific Ocean. A native Tongan chief was offended by this fact, and so he took out some of his men and killed some of the ships. In retaliation, the Chinese had their ships burned. This angered the Tongan chief, so he sent his people into enemy territory to fight back. Then the Chinese began to use all manner of weapons against his followers.\nIn total the Chinese killed about 200 times as many of his warriors as they had when they first attacked him. Finally, when his enemies were dying from wounds, famine or disease, he had a messenger send them a message saying, \"Come with me and I'll show you who the real master is.\" The Tongan warriors agreed, and started to pack their stuff. Then one of them found an arrowhead, and told his companions, \"Look! This arrowhead is a piece of gold!\" He then took a rock and broke the arrowhead, and gave the rest of the warriors the broken end in hopes that it would kill all his killers. It did indeed work. As soon as any enemy saw this, his spirit died, and he became sick and wailed and cried. No matter how much he wailed, he could not die.\nSo, you see, killing is bad, so let's let people be sick and wail for years and get sick and wail some more! But", "answer": "E: let blood"}

Suppose that f = (1,7) and y = (1,2); what will the remainder of f be?\nOutput: (1,7)^2 = (-31,4) because of the imaginary number\nTo find the remainder of f, the remainder divided by x needs to be squared or divided by the fraction that is added. The remainder of f is (31,4) + ((1+1),(31 + 1)/x) * 5\nOutput: y(31)^2 = (-21,4) because of a real number\nTo find the rest of f, the remainder of y plus y divided by x needs to equal 5 and then the remainder divided by y needs to equal (35,5) * 10\nSo the remainder of f is (-21,4) + 1/4(35,5).\nOutput: y(21)^2 = (-16,4) because of an imaginary number\n\nInput: Let E be the surface area of a square and E' = sqrt(E') and sqrt(E')' = sqrt(2E')'.

One uses his hat, and the other uses his shirt, a bandanna, a scarf, and a bag over his head. The other three people have to find these items.  The first person finds them on the table; the second finds them on the bar, and the third finds them on the floor. What is the total area of the pub?\nOutput: The total area is 4 * 2 = <<4*2=64>>64 squares.\nSince the pub is 4*2 = <<4*2-16>>2 squares, the total square area is 64 * 2 = <<4-16=256>>256 squares.\nSince the total square area is 256 squares, the total square distance between 2 adjacent squares is 256*2 = <<16-256=320>>160 squares. So the square area of the pub is 160 * 2 = <<8-160=1600>>160 square meters.\nSince 8 square meters is 4.5 times 9 square meters, 16 * 1024 = 4096 square meters. Therefore the total square distance from 2 adjacent squares is 4096 * 2 = <<20-1024=512>>2.5 square meters.\nTo keep track of all the items the four people bring, how big a space are these squares?\nTo keep track of how many items a pair of glasses can hold, how many glasses can it hold?\nTo keep track how many items a sandwich can hold,", "answer": "D: hat rack"}

The question is what is the rate of water movement at that time.\nOutput: How fast does water flow from the point of deposit to the point of consumption?\nThere is a total of 10 gallons per second moving across the ground, and 12 grams per second flowing uphill. That means there is a total of 10,000,000 grams flowing uphill.\nIf we add in the two grams per second uphill in this question, we get:\n10,000*2*20 = 200,000 grams flowing up\n2x20 + 20 = 200,000,000 grams per hour\nWe are therefore comparing two different rate of flow.

How many children under the age of 90 in the United States died of measles in 2008?\nOutput: The U.S. has 40% fewer children under 90 than Iraq.\nThe U.S. has 70% fewer children under 90 that Iraq did\nTherefore, the U.S. has 710,000 fewer children under 9 than Iraq did\nTherefore, 1,270,000 fewer young children were killed by measles in 2008, making them 730,000 fewer children\nThis is a significant difference, therefore this output is false\n\nInput:  The average number of people dying from an automobile accident in the United States every year is 0.01. In Canada, the number of people dying from automobiles is 0.00.  In Australia, the number of people who die from automobiles is 0.03.  Assuming that automobile accidents are 1% as fatal in each country, in Australia, the number of automobile accidents will be 0.03. In New Zealand, the number of automobile fatalities will be less than 0.001; since automobile accidents are 0.00 in Canada, the number of automobile deaths will be 0.03, the equivalent of 0.10 in Australia, giving an average of 0.01\nOutput: Assume that vehicle accidents are 0.01 % as fatal in Australia as in New Zealand. Given that Australia has 40% fewer people under 90 than New Zealand, New Zealand has 7000 less children under 9 than Australia did in 2008.\nTherefore, 1000 fewer children under 8 were killed in 2008, reducing the number of children under 9 by 7000, which means that the current number of children under 9 increased by 0.21, making an increase of 0.12, giving an average of 1.13\n\nInput: Every Sunday is a public holiday, except for the Monday after Easter.

Most people, no matter which strategy they choose, agree with the purchase, if only they could find a way to make the money.\nSince they have two separate options: borrow money from their parents or to sell their house, the questions they ask are:  What would be the cost of borrowing money and buying a house, if they had both an extra $5,000 and an extra $5,100?\nSince they are short of money in that the amount you buy is not enough", "answer": "B: pantry"}

If you hold on to the ceiling and sit on it, you will accelerate faster than you would without holding on.  Also, there was a study that suggested that the same forces that produce gravity pull down the Earth, so gravity is probably stronger in places with lower gravity.  Other scientists disagree since they say that other forces could also be responsible for gravity.  There are some experts who think that the acceleration of the Earth is a result of the combined forces of light, sound and gravity and that the acceleration is the result of forces that are not related to gravity.  There are also some who think that the acceleration is entirely due to physical processes within the Earth itself, the most prevalent are thermal expansion and contraction.

He will be unable to perceive it if he does not watch it bathe on his watch. But since John has observed the behavior at least 32 times by now he can guess what animal is that based on the positive statistics in this example.\nIf x = 8, John has seen it bathe 8 times times and can guess that it is an elephant.\nIf x = 32, John has observed it bathe 32 times and he already knows what animal is its current behavioral state.\nIf x = 512, then John has only 8 more times to watch it bathe before he determines its current behavioral state. He will be able to see the behavior 32 times more, but unless he knows what animal this is, he will not be able to determine its current state of arousal.\nIf x = 256, then John has only 1 more time to watch it bathe 32 times before he determines its current state of arousal, and if he knows what animal this bathes, it is not going to surprise him or surprise the watcher.\nHowever, if x = 384, then John encounters this behavior much more frequently than he has ever seen it previously and it will surprise him. This also happens to be the type of animal John is most likely to encounter by this time.\nJohn can predict the animal\u2019s current behavioral state based on the positive statistics that are indicated by positive emotions. This animal is probably a hyena.\nJohn can also see something that is unique only to this particular hyena for some reason. This is a rare animal and would be fascinating to watch.\nJohn\u2019s goal is to observe this behavior at least 32 times before the animal can be expected to do so.\n\nInput: After a certain amount of time, the day's moon is no longer visible in the sky.

In the following table, we use the definition that the sheep in the world average five heads per body per year.  What is the average cost of breeding a head to two wool balls?\nOutput: In the following table I use the definition that sheep have about five heads per body per years. I am going to use the cost as the average cost of breeding one sheep to two wool balls in a year  Note that I have omitted the price of the wool balls in my calculations\nI multiply the answer by 100 and add this to the last number (i.e., the average number of wool balls per year per head). I get the following values for average number of wools per head and average number of wool balls:\n$11.50 + $5.00 = $24.00 in cost.  We need $50.00 to be able to breed six sheep to a single wool ball.\nOutput:In the average number of sheep per head equation, we need $50 to be able to breed 6 sheep to a single wool.  For reference, a 5 sheep flock average the number of sheep at an average of about five sheep per body.\nSo, we need $48.24 to be able to breed 10 sheep to a single wool in a year. Add $5.00 to $30.00 = $56.48\nOutput: I multiply the average number of sheep produced by the average number of sheep in the world by five.

How many additional workers can the company hire for that month? What is the difference between one extra worker and two extra workers?\nOutput:  A = (1 + 2)/(2 + 3)/(3 + 4). *(1 + 2)/(1 + 2) = 2 extra workers. *(2 + 3)/ (2 + 3) = 3 extra workers. *(3 + 4)*(1 + 2) is +2 extra workers.

When it comes to doubling the number of sides of a die, it's best to roll it on a single die.  That way you have two double-sided dice, and one less die to handle the rest of the doubling needs.  This way you maximize the amount of times a double-sided die can be doubled, while avoiding the trouble of double-doubling it.\nOutput: The number that a double-sided die doubles once it has rolled once more is 5.\n\nInput: If you are given the number 12 on a die, what is the number of ways to do 12?\nOutput: There are 12 ways to roll one more step by rolling all possible combinations of digits in the number.  When you start doubling the number of ways you should do, this step just gets that much more difficult.  You can double 12 by doubling the number of ways to count 2's, doubling it by doubling the number of times you count a 2 as a 2, doubling it by doubling it, doubling it by double-double-doubling it, double 12 by multiplying 12 times 12 times 12, repeating doubling 6 times, etc.  These are just 6 of your possibilities for doubling an even number.

How much weight should the patient lose in 5 months?\nOutput: If someone would gain weight during this time, he would gain twice as much back. So he would not make any healthy gains. In 10 months, he would lose 60 pounds.\nSo he would lose 60*10=<<60*10-1>>60 pounds in 10 months. He would not make any healthy weight gains during this 10 months.\nIn 12 months, he would lose 100 pounds. He would not make enough healthy weight gains in 12 months for any to be observed, but the patient would be much healthier.\nSo in 22 months, he would gain 100 plus 60 = <<100-60=230>>230 pounds.\nHe would gain no weight for 22 months, as he would be much healthier by then.\nSo in 3 months, he would be at the ideal weight. He would not make much of a change to his current body weight, but he would gain a lot more healthy weight over the next three months than he did in the previous three.\nSo in 6 months, he would be very unhealthy, but would gain 100+30 = <<100+30=300>>300 pounds.\nHe gains 100 pounds because he gained over 300 pounds in the first 6 months.\nSo in 12 months, he gains 100 and 30 + 30 = <<100-30=315>>315 pounds. He gains healthy weight during the 12 months.\nSo in 21 months, he is at a healthy weight to make significant weight gains.\nSo in 6 years, he would have no weight loss in a 4-year period. He would gain a lot of healthy weight, and lose little to no weight.\nSo in 10 years, he would not lose as much healthy weight over the 10 years as he did over the previous 10 years.\nSo in 8 years, he would loose a lot of weight. He would gain even less than he gained last year. So he would gain 5 pounds again, as he did last year.\nSo in 3 years, he would gain as little fat as he gained last year.

You'll need something to carry it in. A simple plant bag will work. But it doesn't help keep it that.  A better solution would be to use a water-tight container.

The short answer is:  If you're going to the house of a relative, you're not going to want to worry about having your stash in your bag at all.

The distance between both balconies and the attic is = 30*30 = <<30*30=<<30*30>>30\nSince 30*30 < 30*30, 30*30 = 2*30*30 - 30*30 - 30*10 =<<30*30-10>>30\nSince 10*30 == 10, 1*10 = 0\nSince 0 = 0, 3*30 - 30 = 3 = 1\nTherefore 3*30", "answer": "D: underground"}
{"text": "If this question were asked at night, and someone were to respond, you would guess that the person had dreams of restlessness and snoring.  The correct answer is that the person stated that he/she had \"restful moments\".  You would guess that the person slept during these \"restful periods\".  This indicates to you that the person suffers from a mild case of REM sleep disassociation disorder.  The correct answer to this question would be that the time spent sleeping through the REM sleep disorder is negligible, and the real problem is the disassociation itself.  The correct answer would be that the person suffered from this condition for 10 minutes.\n\nInput: In an airport, a woman lost her luggage. She went up to a desk to ask for help.

Using your logic, there should be 300 cars for every car.\nOutput: Each car in circulation has 1,000,000,000,005 miles on it.\nSince there are only 100,000,000,001 cars in total then you have to calculate the number of miles on every car in circulation by dividing it by its length, which is 1. Then again, to get the number of cars in circulation you have to multiply that by its square root, so then divide by 2, which gives you 25,824,800,000,001,000,000, 000,0025, so then divide by 9, which is 3, giving you 10,000,000, 001, 025,000,000, and the number of cars in total should be 10 million, which is 1.2 billion.\nOutput: In an hour the total miles on every car in the United state can be calculated by multiplying it by its square root.\nSince that number of cars in circulation is 10 million, each car would have 150,100 miles on it, so the total miles on every vehicle", "answer": "B: office"}

If you count in a range from 30-75, then count in a range from 20-40.\nIf you count in any of these ranges, the number must fall within this range. Otherwise you are not counting correctly.\nThe number is not 60\nIf the number falls outside of this range, the balloon must have been blown in, or it has no balloon at all. If the balloon has no balloon at all, the balloon must not have been used, because it is in the wrong state.

How many cars drive around at rush hour each day in February?\nOutput: If six times 30 or 30 times 60 is equal to 100 cars, then how many cars are there in February?\nThe number is 100\nSince it is February, there were 100 < 20 cars, 60 50 cars, 60 60 cars, 60 80 cars, and 60 100 cars\nThe numbers are 100-60=<<100-60=210>>210 cars\nSince it is February there could be 200+20 cars, or more than 1000 cars\nThe number was not 20\nSince the number did not fall within either of these ranges, the car was not in the carpool lane when it was counted, therefore the car did not reach its destination. Therefore the car was not in a rush, it was not in the car pool lane, and the car was not in rush hour. Therefore there were not 200+20 cars in February, and there were not 1000+22 cars (because there were only 20 to do it).

A: 4 B: 6 C:9 D:10\nOutput: 4\n\nInput:  If 1 red lily and 1 yellow lily were given to a student, two lilies would be given to the same student at the same time. If 1 red lily is given to both students at the same time, 2 lilies are given to the students at the same time. What is the probability that both students get 2 lilies?\nOutput: If a student gave a red lili and 2 lilies to an other student, one student's lily would be given twice while that student's red Lily is given twice as well and two different lilies. If 2 lilies are distributed among three students during first 8 seconds, they will be given twice during the same second. The probability that one student gets 2 lilies in a row will increase due to the random number generator while the probability of getting the other students get less lily increases. Therefore the total proportion of red and yellow lilies at the second location is 2 * [(6 - 2)*2*((2*8/2)*2).+10^2]/10 = (3 + 3) / 2 = (1 + 1) = 3 / [10^1]/10\nTherefore, the overall probability distribution for two people's red and yellow lilies is [10^1] (2/(2+1)*1) / 10.= [10 [10].+3]/10 = [10 [10].3]/10.\nSince the probability depends on the number of students giving red and yellow lily the same probability, the overall overall chances to get 2 lilies from two red lilies in a row is [10] / 10 = [10 [10]], where 10 = [10 []]. Therefore the overall probability of getting 2 lilies from two yellow lilies in a row during the 1st and the 2nd part of a second is [10 [10].\nOutput: [(1-10)]/10 < 5/10 (6+6) / 5 = 1/10\nTherefore, [(1-10)]/(10+10) / 10 = [10](10/10).+0.918 = (10/[10] + [10)].+10 = [(1-10)]*1 = [(1-10) - (1*1", "answer": "A: zoo"}

He came to work a day ahead to avoid the penalty. The woman he visited is a widower. They each earn the same amount.\nWhat was the woman's income for the year in question?\nOutput: Christian earns the same $3200 as Brian does. She earned $3200 more in the last six months than she did in the year-ago month.\nAs a result, Christian worked the last six months longer than the previous six months. His overall income was $7.000 in six months, but he earned $10.000 more than Brian did. So in the six months preceding the year-ago month, Christian brought in twice the amount of income Brian did in that same year. This is an increase of $400 in total annual income in those six months, that he could not otherwise have earned in the whole year. So he earned a substantial amount each year in the last six months\nChristian will earn more money in those six months in the year to follow than he did in the year that preceded. At his current speed, he would have earned the same annual income in the year before that, as he did in the year after that. Thus, his earnings will be greater in two years than they will be in the year to follow.\nIf the woman earns the same $3100 in year five as she did in the year prior, then he will make more money in year five than he did in the last six months. He will earn $1750 less in the year to follow, than he did in the first six months of the year of year that follows. So the increase in yearly income will be greater than the decrease in income he earned in the same year of the year preceding. Thus his annual income will be greater in year two than it will be in the year after that, but it will be less than in two years after that.\nTherefore, in the year to follow he will be earning less than the woman earns in the year before that. Thus, his yearly income will be equal to that of the woman, while he will be making less than $3,100 as", "answer": "E: wave on"}

{"text": "he wanted to know the truth\nB: he wants C: he found/did not find D: didn't\nIn this case, he is unsure what is the correct answer\n\nInput: There are 10 cars in a parking lot. The parking lot is 100 yards long and 3 yards wide. How many cars can you fit on the parking lot?\nOutput: 10 + 3 = 20\nSince there are ten cars + 3*100 = 100, the total is 100 + 3*100 = 200.\nSo the total number of cars is 200\nFrom your list of 100, you can determine that 20 plus 3*100 = 200\nSince all ten car + 3*100 = 20, the total is 200\nSince all 10 car + 3*100 * 100= 20\nThe original list of 100 minus 5*100 = 10, then 20 plus 3*100 * 100 = 30\nSince all 10 car * 100* = 30, then 200 plus 30*100 = 300\nSince all 10 car / 3*100 = ~30, then 300*30 = 550*300\nSince all 10*300 = 550*30, then 550*30+1100 = 1150*550\nSince all 10*1100 = 1100*30*300, then 330*30 + 1100*300 = 550*550\nSince all 110*300*30 = 45, then 55*30 = 55*30 + 40, then 100*30\nSince all 2000*300+110*300\nSince all 2500*300+110*500 = 2 = 5\nSince the car weighs 500 lbs. we do the math and find that the car is 1*300 + 5*500 * 1000 = 1000 lbs. So the weight of the car is 1000 + 5*500 * 3000 = 1800 lbs.\nThus the total weight of the car is 900 * 4500 = 2400 lbs.\nSo the total weight of the cars is 2400 * 900 = 2400 lbs\nIn this example, Mark decided only one car plus 10*500 * 3000 = 30, meaning the total of all the cars is 2400 * 2400 = 3600 lbs. So the total weight of the 20 cars is 3600 lbs or 3600 x 4500 + 2400 * 3000 = 6000 lbs.\nSo Mark is correct in saying that knowing the total weight is the answer to the question\ninput:\nInput: Two people drive to the beach to have a picnic in the sunshine.

In that time the object would have stretched so far that the sun would be hidden.

{"text": "Use B for a surface of earth as it works better, and C for an ice cube as it is easier.  I think its more fun to have my house ice cube than it is to have it use a humidifier.  You should use A to put the ice cube on.  Because it will need a surface on the house for drying out.  That is why I picked D.  You should use E to create the skating rink.  That is why you chose ice cube.\n\nInput: Christian wears his coat every day when he goes to the doctors and pharmacy.  Christian's wife, Mary, doesn't wear a coat.  On their daily walks, Mary wears her coat.  When Christian goes to the doctor, he always carries his coat.  What does Mary do?\nOutput: For walks, use A. For doctor's appointments, use D. For pharmacy pickup, use C. On visits to home, use A.  For medical bills, use D.\nSince Christian wears his coat every time he goes to the doctors, Mary is not wearing her coat at any doctor's appointments or pharmacy pickup.  Thus, not wearing a coat on walks takes about one hour off his coat/doctor day.\nUsing A to go outside means walking an extra one hour each morning.  Using D to go outside means walking one hour each morning and an extra one hour each afternooon.\nSince Mary doesn't wear a coat when she goes outside, she also doesn't wear one on visits to home.  Thus, Mary is able to see her doctor 2 hours earlier per week than she normally does.\nUsing C to go to the pharmacy means two additional stops for her and an extra one hour per week.\nUsing D to go to the pharmacy doesn't take any more time off his doctor's appointments than just using A to go outside. He still saves one hour each doctor's appointment and one hour each afternoon.  So using A is the easiest.\nMary will see her doctor twice as often each week.  Using C is twice as inconvenient per week.\nUsing E to create a skating rink means three additional stops for her on the road.  Using A to go outside means two additional stops.\nUsing E to make the ice cube means one car trip per week.  Using D to create a skating rink is three different trips in three different directions.\nUsing C to make the ice cube is twice as inconvenient per doctor's appointment per week as using A to go", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

A fishnet should drain if there is no catch and there are fish in it.\nThe resulting pattern of swimming, is that if there is no catch the net has no movement, so the net does not drain but if there is a catch and there is a fish in the net after a little while then there is movement in the net. So the net should drain after a short time if there is only a catch for a fish, otherwise there is no movement in the net and the net has no water but if the net is full of fish the net should drain after it catches a fish. So the net should take water in and out.

On Monday, math teachers called and asked if they could substitute teachers for 1 unit of math instruction per day, Monday-Friday, for 12 weeks. What proportion of math teachers will be subbed for math instruction on Monday?\nOutput: Since math teachers can substitute once per year and the 1,000 students will have 100 math teachers, on average, 50 math teachers will be subbing for math instruction each day.\nSo on average, 5 math teachers will be subred at 1 unit of math instruction each day, while 50 math teachers will be substituting for only 1 unit of math instruction a day.\nSo in the end 50 x 50 = 105 math teachers will be substitutes for 1 unit of math each day.\nSo in this example, 35 math teachers will be substitutatd for 1 unit of math in total.\nSo 5 math teachers per day are 0.5% of each math teachers' number of math teachers + substitute teachers.\nSo 20 teacher-subtitlers = 0.5 teacher-subtitler=0.0035\nSo Math teacher-subtitrators = 0.05\nSo 0.0035 teacher-subtitrator = 10.5 teacher-subs/100\nSo Math teacher-s-10 = 11 teacher-subs/each = 1/2 = 1/40\nSo Math teacher-10sub = 0.5 teacher = 0.005\nSo 5 teacher-sub = 0.5 = 0.007\nSo math teacher-sub=4\nSo math teacher = 1*0.001\nSo math tutor = 1*0.0001\nSo tutor = 0.005\n\nInput:  One of Jane's favorite foods to cook is chicken, so she cooked one whole chicken using the following ingredients:\na box of boneless skinless Chicken breasts\na bag of frozen veggies\n1/2 a bag of dry roasted red potatoes\na bag of frozen corn\na large bag of chicken broth\n1/2 a block of butter\n1/4 a stick of margarine\n1/2 a box of powdered sugar\n1/2 a roll of aluminum foil\n4 slices of white loaf butter\n1/4 pint of mayonnaise (1/3 cup of mayonnaise per chicken)\nA box of frozen watermelon\n2 sticks of raw broccoli", "answer": "B: less confusion"}

It only has 4\nsoft days.\nThen it has 2 \"soft\" weeks.\n\nOutput: There are 4*4*2 extra days in every eight weeks so that after 8 weeks there are 8*8+2 = 112 extra days in a year. Suppose you had a total of 112 extra days in one week, or the average after 8 weeks is 3*3.3 = 6.3 extra days for the year. But after a year, this extra 3.3 extra days is 6*12.5 = 16 weeks of extra days. So extra days are actually 16 times 2.16 = 33.12 times 8 = 33 extra days. So the total year would actually be 33 days extra.\nInput: There are 16 week-days; the first eight weeks have 32 weeks. There are 12 weeks left every seven years.

Can you determine when the time that Jane was awake the Tuesday night before the Friday morning was?\nOutput: Since the current time is the exact same as the time that Jane was awakened the Tuesday night before, the time that Jane was awaken the Friday night before the Tuesday night before the Thursday night before the Saturday morning is 6:00.\nSo here is a simple equation.\nJane's time = 7:12, the current time is 8:00.\nJane's time that day = <<7-8=2>>2 hours, meaning that it was not 7:12 am on Tuesday.\nSince the time is exactly twice the time that Jane was woken up on Tuesday, it is 2*>>2 = 2*8 = 9:52. That is, Jane's time is 9:52 times the time that she wakened at 7:12 am on the Tuesday.\nSince 8*2 = 8*2, the current time of Jane is 9:52 times 8*8 = 8:52 which is the exact same as 7:12 = 7:12.\nSince the time was correct in terms of the day, then Jane's time was 9:52 times 8:52 = 9:52 which is the opposite of the amount of time that Jane was awake on Tuesday.\nSo the final correct answer is 9\n\ninput/select: The president is making a speech before the Senate.

How long does it take each person to finish his/her cup?\nOutput: Each person finished his/her full cup in ten minutes.\nIf six people held their cups at their sides, they would wait in line behind each other for ten minutes before filling their cup\nSo, the final answered is ten\n\nThe final answer: Every hour past noon the shadows of the building stretch an extra 5 (1-6) feet, beginning at zero the hour before at noon. Because the shadow is so long, when the building leaves the shadow, it appears to lengthen an extra 5 (1+5=6) feet, to an extra 5 (1+(5+6)*6)=<<5+5=10>>10 feet.\nIf the shadow stretches by 5 feet per hour from 1:00 to 3:00, this means that in three hours the shadow would have stretched an extra five feet (1) = <<5+5=10**1=5.5>>5 feet  The building would last at least 5 more hours than the people inside were willing to wait.\nSo, the extra two-hour frame in which the building will last until 8:15:30 is\n<<5+2-1=6**2=8>>8 * 5+2*6 = <<8+2-1=10>>8 + 6\nIn eight hours, the extra five-hour frame in which it will last four more hours is\n<<5-2*4+1=10>>10 * 5 + 1 = <<5-2*4-1=12>>12 + 4\nIn eight hours, it will last 8 hours longer than the people inside.\nSo the final 8 hours in which it will last is\n<<4*8-2-1-2=12>>12 + 2\nIn eight hours, all the buildings will stay up for a total of 8 hours and 24 minutes and 18 seconds and not come down until 10:14:45 AM, at the end of the day.\nSo at 10:14:45AM, all the buildings still will not fall down in 8 hours and 24 minutes.", "answer": "D: engine"}

They also add a price for each volume of the two same books in the first copy. The other copy has no price list but does not have the titles mentioned. The price of each copy of the two same books is 50 cents. How much money would Michael and Lawrence have earned if they made no changes to their prices and instead just changed the prices on their third and fifth copies?\nOutput: If Michael and Lawrence kept the three copies in the first copy and the third copy in the second copy, they would be able to bring in: 14.5 * 50 * 10 = $<<14$ = 30>>30\nIf Michael and Lawrence did nothing different in the first copy and just added a 50 cent price to the third and fifth copies, they would be able: 15.5* 50 * 10 = $\n30 = 30 >> 30\nIf Michael and Lawrence increased the price of their third and fifth copies by 5 cents, they would be able 15*50 + 5 = $40\nNow, if the fifth copy included the first two copies, Michael and Lawrence would be able 25*50 + 5 = 75\nIf Michael and Lawrence sold the fifth copy for $75, they would make $75 + 25 + 5 = $250\nIf Michael and Lawrence just sold the fifth copy for 50 cents, they would be making less than $18\nSo the sales price for the five copies would be 50 + 25 + 5 + 15 + 5 = $155\nA total of 155 = $190\nThe final answer is 155.5\n\nInput: The total amount of money that is lost by every student when a student refuses to pay their tuition, is the number of hours of instruction that the student will get out for the following year.\nOutput: The total amount of time the student will get out of school is the number of hours they have left in their current school year + the number of hours that can be scheduled with another school during the same school year.

If she gave away half the cats in the first month, her money would be $3 less than $5. What would the money amount be over the year if the money amount is $20 more than $5?\nOutput: Let $21 become $15 = $<<$21-->$15 =<<21=20>>20\nThe $20 amount is $20 less than $15, so the actual amount of money given up would be: $20/3 = $<<20+15=25>>25\nThe $15 amount would be $<15<21=15>>15.5 =<<<15+21+15=25>>8>>8\nSo $15 = <<15+21=15>>8, or: 15 + $21.5 = $<<15+21+15.5>>8 +$23\nSo the final answer would be 8\n\nInput: There is a boy who has to write a 1,500 word paper every day for a month.

{"text": "A\nThere are many reasons for going to school for at least some time each day.\nBut choosing which choice is the good reason depends on whether you are a student or a parent. If you attend school because your parents are paying for it, you will probably want to choose to go to school so that your income will not drop. If you go to school because you love it and want to learn new things, it will be harder to justify going since there are lots of things that you are doing just for enjoyment and not necessarily so that you can learn. To avoid getting a low-paying job for an extended amount of time while you go to school, or paying for a lot of books for several years, your choice should be B.\nInput: A\nThere is a lot of homework for students because they have to do it to learn what they haven't learned in school. So if you go to school instead of doing home-schooling, you will be forced to learn all the new things your parents have not taught you. However, some students do not mind all the homework because they get to learn new things that they can't learn from reading about them on the internet. The choice of D shouldn't bother you if you attend school because you don't mind staying up late studying to get your homework done. The choice of E won't bother you because you are busy every single day and you do not like studying all the time. The choice of C will probably be ok even if you attend school after being a good student throughout high school but don't like doing homework and spending time in front of the computer because you get bored easily and want to have fun. The choice of E is probably the best choice if you don't have a lot of homework but still want to get good grades so that you can get a good job and make a good income. And if your parents pay for most of your tuition, then probably the choice of E would be nice as well. The choice of D should be the choice for you if you are not interested in becoming rich or getting a good job.\nInput: D\nIf you spend at least some of your time in school, then going to school must be a good choice for you.

How much money would they make from the sale of Sarah's crops?\nOutput: When Sarah sells her crops for $0.90 a bushel, they have $4,100.40.\nSo the sale of Sarah's crop adds $4,100.00 to their farmhouse's sale value.\nSince Sarah has $4,100.30 in her farmhouse's sale value, Boris has $4,100.*50=$4,100.80\nSo the sale of his crop adds $4,800.*50=$4,800.80\nThey also take in 20 head of cattle (10 for Boris and 10 for Sarah), plus 4 bull calves (2 for Sarah and 2 for Boris), plus 2 calf cows (1 for Sarah and 1 for Boris), plus a total of 22 head of cattle.\nSo the sale value of Sarah's crop adds 22*250= $8,500, the sale value of Boris's crop adds 22*75, the sale value of Sarah and Boris's crop adds 22, and the sale value of Sarah, Boris, and Sarah's crop adds 22. In addition to the sale of Sarah's products, they are also able to sell their manure for $40 a barrel.\nWith their sale value and sale value of the crop added together they have $12,000.40.\nSo they have $12,800.80 > 11*$12,000.40 > 11*$12000.40 > 11*, and Sarah's crop adds 1/3 of their farmhouse sale value, and the sale of their crop adds 1/4 of their farmhouse sale.

Since their farmhouse sale value is $12,000.80 / (12,100.80 + 1/4 of $8,500/$12000.60) / (6,100.80/$9,000.80) + 22,\nSarah makes $6,300.15 and Boris makes $6,800.20\nBoth sell enough crops (14 and 16).

So painting will take you 7 hours total, if you are an amateur painter.\nIf painting a 10 x 10 room takes 15 hours, then it would take 8 hours to dry completely. That leaves 15 hours for painting the walls.\nIf painting the walls 5 hours total takes 1 hour, then cleaning will take 30 minutes each, so 1 hour total plus 30 minutes to wash the walls will be left out for cleaning.\nIf painting the rooms 5 hours total takes 40 minutes each, then cleaning will take 3 hours each, so 3 hours total plus 3 hours to wash the walls will take 10 minutes each.\nPaint and wall cleaning times will be more closely in balance if the total time to clean a wall is 5 hours because it only takes 2 hours to paint the walls. If painting the walls take 5 hours total, then 15 hours to clean the walls is taken out of that 2.5 hours of painting that is included with 3 hours of cleaning.\nThe only way to make it take only 2 hours to paint the wall is to sand and polish all the walls, sand those 5 hours away, and then paint again.

The second line of the answer is a rational fraction. Let x = the total space required for a normal triangle.

The fourth line of the answer is x * y + b * Z. Therefore x = a + b * z > 0. Therefore, z > 0. Therefore y < a * Z * Z, so both y and z are negative values.

If there are 4 students, then there must be 4 pages per class. Let y be the total number of pages between those two numbers. Then let a, which is the number in the student column, be the total number in the teacher column. Finally, let x = the total number x in the teacher column. So y = (1/2)(2)(4)\nLet the teacher divide the total students by the class size. If the total count of pages for each class is 25, there must be 25 students for that class. If the count of students divided by the total count of pages is 50, then there must be 50 students for that class. This means that if 10 students and 5 teachers would like to give 25 students each 25 new books, then we must set each teacher's books aside, and divide 50/25 = 25. We divide those 50/25 by the total counts multiplied by the class count, which is what we get. Let a be the total count in classes divided by 3. Let a = 25. The result is that if a = 50 then 25 = 50\nSo if we divide 50/25 by 25 and divide 25/25 by 3, we get 10.\nSo if our teacher's books are gone, we get 10.

Then we divide x by the total pages x, divided by the class count, and divide 1/2 by the total pages x. Let a be the teacher's books.

When the time comes to pay for my cheeseburger,  I know that if I pay the same $2.00 with the $1.98 coupon as I would with the $2.00 coupon without the $1.98 candy, I will get half the value for the $1.98 food item because the coupon doesn't work on food items that are higher than or equal to the price of $1.98.

Output: A + 90 + 20 + 120 Points = 120 points A + 90 + 10 = 120 points\nGiving 120 points would give your team a total of 140 + 10 = 260 points. If A scores 20 points, their score is 10 + 20 = 20. Therefore, their win total is 260 + 20 + 20 * 20 = 260 + 70 + 40 = 440 points. Thus, your team ends up with the 120 point total. So the final team B score is 160 + 70 - 40 * 20 = 140 = 130 points\nSo the final team B score = 130 = 160 + 70 + 40 * 20 = 130\n\nInput:The car you were given is a 2004 Mazda MX-5 Miata.

After giving the books to the Library & Bookstore, how many books have Boris actually donated this year?\nOutput: After giving the 8 books to the Library & Books, Boris has actually donated 7 books to the Library & Store\nAfter giving the 7 books to the Library, Boris actually has actually donated 6 books to the Library\nAfter giving the 6 books to the Library, then all the books he donated to the Library for this year is only 5 books\nSo if Boris donated 30 books to the Library after this year, Boris donated 17 books to the Library in total (6 books donated to the Library, 13 books donated to the Library & Store).\nSo the final answer would be 17*30 = <<17+14+18=31>>31 books\nSince Boris donated 17 books to his Library, we would see that he donated 3 books to the Library & Shop.\nSo this gives Boris 36 books donated to his Library for 2017.\nWhat is Boris in total? 31.5 books/3 + (21.5/3) = 40 books\nBut of the 40 books that Boris donated, 19 books go to the Library and 15 books go to the Bookstore.

After you've sold half of the necklace, you give the other half back to the customer. In your total profit, how much money did you make that day?\nOutput: To find out how much money Cameron made from the sale of half the necklace, we will first determine how much each box of cereal cost.\nSecond: To find out how many of the 10 different types of cereal that were available when Cameron went to work that day, we will assume he bought 3 types of cereal. We will then divide the total of all 50 cereal boxes sold on that day into 3 equal parts. Then, we will perform the cost-benefit analysis.\nNote: When looking at the numbers above, we first divide 1, 2, 3, and 4 into 3 equal parts.\nNumber 1 = $8\nNumber 2 = $8\nNumber 3 = $8 (total)\nNumber 4 = $9 (total)\nNumber 5 = $9 (total), 2/3 of the total\nThis total of $10 (1/3) will be divided by the 50 cereal boxes total sales of $10 (3/4) \u2013 $11 (3/4) = $20.\nSo each cereal box of cereal sold costs $3.50 (total)\nThus, in total Cameron made $20 off of 10 different types of cereal.\nSo the final amount Cameron made from the sale was $35 (total)\n\nInput: You have 5 animals.

The person then travels back home. The person who is in charge of the movie now has to look and see how long they have been following that track to figure out whether or not they have actually watched the movie. If they look south from South Carolina, they have already been going south for about 3 hours.

If they figure that all of the time they have been away is about 5 hours, then they would have made it to Alabama at 3am. If they then calculate that the time they have been running around for on the map is more like 12 hours, then that would equate to 8 hours of driving time. Since the movie is about 1 hour, at 5 hours they have driven 2.5 hours. Therefore, they have been driving 8 hours of driving time while also watching a movie.

What is the best way to learn a language?\nOutput: If you are learning a foreign language, you probably don't get it by reading, so how to you learn a foreign language?\nLet's say you have to learn a new language so you can teach or show someone else how the language is used. You probably don't get language without a very clear picture of the words and sounds and the grammatical structures in use. There are other ways to learn a language but we'll discuss those in detail below.\nThe best way to learn a foreign language is to study it slowly and consistently for many years. A good place to begin is with a vocabulary builder like Khan Academy. There are other good resources available for vocabulary but the Khan Academy takes care of all of the math and grammar aspects of language. All you will need to do is click a button and begin studying your new language. You don't need any special software because the language is automatically set up to allow you to type English into Google and then type whatever you want into the boxes that the computer creates before it generates a native English vocabulary. If you want to type in Japanese, for instance, typing the words into Google will take you straight to a page on the Japanese Wikipedia\nThere are books that you can also use to learn a foreign language. I don't recommend using them. If you want to learn a language you don't need to learn the syntax. This will get much harder to do later in the language. There are also books for languages that are really only used occasionally.\nIf you do not know how to learn how to speak a foreign language, I strongly recommend taking an immersion class. This will really get your mind into the habit of learning a new language\n\nInput: Which of the following words starts with \"W\" and ends with \"F\"?\nOutput: Which starts with 'W' and ends with 'V'?\nWhich starts with 'F' and ends with 'J'?\nInput:Which is the longest word on the word list that is not a vowel?\nOutput:Which is the next longest word on the wordlist?\nInput:", "answer": "C: thinking"}

When he went out for a ride on his motorcycle, he realized there was a hole in the left front tire. He was able to solve the problem by adjusting the tire size and not adjusting the pressure. But Bobby found out that another motorcyclist had already fixed the problem and had driven his bike without a problem. When Bobby looked for some advice online, he found the following information: When a person buys tires at a tire store, they usually have a set that is good for 3,000 miles. This means that for every 7,000 miles, the tire will need to be replaced. When Bobby looks at the owner's manual, it also says that for every 7,500 miles, the tire must be replaced. So how does this help him solve his problem?\nInput: Bobby has a hole in one of his front tires. It is easy to fix it, but the problem is that it is in the left front. As a result, driving on that tire is really hard for him. When Bobby decided to look for some advice on the Internet, he found 2 websites. One was an expert in bike tires and the other was a professional mechanic. Both suggested that Bobby could not do his problem. However, they both suggested that he look at the owner's manual and read the section on tire pressure. The first suggested that he look at some tire shops and see if they know how to fix this problem. The second suggested that he check his tire size. The owner's manuel also has a section on tire pressure and Bobby found that the page for his tire size said that the shop he needed to go to would be $25 and it can take up to a week for them to get the part. So which option should he choose?\nOutput: He should have a professional mechanic look at his tire and then he can determine how much time he will have to drive his bike. In other words, he should decide how much money he can spend and buy a new tire. But Bobby decided to spend the extra $25 and buy a new wheel.\n\nInput:You must calculate the annual cost of water in gallons for the last 100 years.

Then we can account for the depreciation/interest fees of $500 from the total cost of $350.\nThen, if we deduct $100, that totals out to $250. If we deduct another $100, that totals to $300. If we deduct $175, that totals about $225.\nNow deduct $125. Then it is $250. If we subtract $125, the total has $200. So we need to get to $200 by subtracting another $125.\nA budget in car C is $600, so we subtract $100. That is about $350. For Car B, the budget is $450 because of the depreciation/interest fees, so $350 is about $250.\nSo $350 is what we need to get to.

One afternoon, she used it to make a small table. She found it to be a nice piece of furniture, and she decided to restore it to its former glory by putting new wood on the table.\nShe found that it was possible to put a pencil on each corner of the table, leaving the edges of the edge of the table free. This made it possible to write on a piece of parchment paper with the pencil (or the parchment paper with the pencil). After she finished applying the pencil on the edges of the table, she then wrapped her paper with duct tape and glued it to the table. After it was all glued, she cut the edges of duct tape off. Once this was done, she then used a metal ruler to cut out the table, then used red duct tape to line up the sides and the ends of the table with some paper in between them. Using a flat plane, she then shaped the table in the desired shape.\nFinally, she then cut the table down to accommodate her new desk-top.\nWhen finished, she put the table back in the same box that she used to transport it. Using a hammer, she hammered the table onto the desk.

There are 4 or 5 fields on his farm. The farm has 16 cows. Of those 16 cows, 2 cows are in the barnyard. The barnyard is about 500 feet long. The farmer has 2 cows that are about to calve. The farmer knows how many weeks away the cows will calve. At harvest time, the farmer places each cow in the arena and watches her do her calving. Then he calves each cow. In about 1 week, the farmer will have calved all 24 cows and he will know which of the 2 cows that are just about to calve are in the arena. He will take them to the arena, and then the farmer will move all of the remaining cows to the barnyard so that they will be well fed for the rest of the calving season. One week after the calving season is over, the manager of the farm comes to his farm, and asks about buying some wheat for his farm. The manager asks if the farmer has wheat. The farmer tells him that he does. The manager takes the wheat and then tells the farmer to take the horses to the field that he has stored the wheat in. For the next week, the manager will keep track of how much wheat has been planted in that farm. His son will calculate how much corn was to be planted during the summer. When time comes for the farmer to sell his crops, the manager will have the farmer list the prices of what the farmer will accept at the end of the season. The barnyard is then marked with wooden stakes, and the farmer decides how much grain he will buy at the end of the crop farming year.\nSo the final sentence is: One farmer planted wheat in a field and had to wait 1 week until the 2 cows that are in the barnyard to calve were sold. Later on that week, the second farmer realized that he had about 28 cows that he still had to calve. His son then saw that the 1st farmer already had 2 cows sold. The son told his father about the sale, and the farmer paid the second farmer for his harvest.

Then, let's put the sides on top of each other and make the three middle sections with their sides equal. How do we determine how many sides the square have?\nOutput: We start with the squares the most left to right and work from there. For example, a square with two sides is of length (2^4 - 1) and height (1**2-1) = 9. So the side lengths of the square are (2^4 - 9)/2, 3, and 12.\nNow for the two other squares, the lengths are (2^3-9)/2, 5, and 7. The height is (2^8-9)/2. So the lengths of the sides of both other squares are (2^3/9)/5, 7, and 12.\nTo find the sum of those 2^12 sides of the squares, we are going to have to do the following:\n2^12 - 2^12/2 = 2^96 = 4.7\n2^96/2 = 2^192 = 3.8\n2^192/2 = 3^256 = 6.2\nSo there are 96 sides of the squares. We now have 2^96 divided by 2^96 = 1.\nThen we do the following:\n12^96/2 = 12^192/2 = 1.56\n12^192/2 = (1.56 * 1.56/2) / 2 = 1.57\nThen 1.57 / 2 = 0.88\n\nInput: There is a man who works for 3 hours in the summer.

If someone buys a scratch off ticket for the same amount as a ticket for the draw with tax, but buys a scratch off win in the same area, the person who buys the scratch off win usually wins more money from the scratch off than the person who buys a ticket for the draw.\nSource of information using the draw as the data source: Draw tickets have 3 odds when it comes to winning. You have 0.065 of a chance to win, 0.01 of a chance to win every ticket you buy, and 0.0001 of a chance of winning the very most valuable prize, the jackpot. The odds of winning are 0.00001 of every ticket sold, and the odds of winning that very jackpot is 0.0000001 of every ticket sold. For these odds, your odds of winning the jackpot are approximately 0.00000002. It is nearly impossible that any ticket sold in a lottery will guarantee a win, or even a small chance. Therefore, statistically speaking, it is impossible for someone to win the jackpot by playing a lottery ticket. The odds of winning the jackpott are extremely low.\nConclusion:\nScratches tickets are not good for someone to play on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

{"text": "This is a good problem. Each teacher has to complete each task.\nIn general, our teachers have to complete 1/3 of their tasks before they can move on to the next one.\nNext, teachers have to complete 1-2 of their tasks before they move on to another task. Next, one teacher has 1 week to complete 1-3 of their tasks, then move on to the next task. After each teacher has moved on to the next task, one teacher will have 30 hours to complete a task. Finally, the last teacher, who had 30 hours, has to complete the task in 2 hours or less. After the teacher has completed his/her 3 tasks, the teacher can move on to the task in 30 hours.\nThus, the teacher that finished his tasks in 30 hours has more time to complete his/her task in two hours or less.\nWhen one teachers task is completed in 30 hours, he/she can move on to the second and so on. Thus, the teacher who finished 30 hours has more time on his/her hands than other teachers\n\nInput: Let us assume that 5,000 people attended a dinner party. Each of these people spent 2 hours at the gathering. What was the total cost of the party?\nOutput: Let us assume that every person at the party pays $200. Each person at the party spent 2 hours at the party.\nSo the total food cost per person at the party was: $200 \u2013 200 = <<200$200/2>>200\nSo the final answer for the party is $200\n\nInput: There were 10 families in the restaurant.

The total amount of sandwiches needed to be served is 135.\nTherefore, the total amount left over from the party is 135 / 120 = <<135/120=7>>7\nSince the total amount of slices is 7, the total time needed to serve 3,000 people at the party is 2 hours.\nNext, let's say each family only gets 60 slices each day.", "answer": "C: open boxes"}

We divide all 120 by (30-60) = [6 - 6] / (60-30) = [6 - 5] so that we get 9 oranges per stack. If the 10 oranges were already sliced, we go to [6 - 4] divided by [6 - 8] to get 7 oranges per stack.

{"text": "Let x be the number of new things she is seeing the whole day. Let y be the number of new experiences she has thus far.\nInput: Alice is a painter and works at night when she is home from school. Her paint bucket contains 22 colors. Let d be the number of paint strokes that Alice paints each night. Let b be the paint she has left to paint that night. Let a be the amount of paint that she has left by the end of the day.\nOutput: Suppose Alice paints 4 large squares. Her canvas is 6 feet by 6 feet. Let d>=12. Let b>=7. Let a>=9. Then she has painted x = 32 color strokes during the day. Let d/12 = 0.6 and let b/12 = 0.3. Assume that (0.6*0.3)/0.3*x=.1, thus Alice has painted x = 32 colour strokes plus 0.1 paint strokes. So Alice's painted square is shown above.\nWith the value of (d/12)/0.1, Alice painted x = x*2 + x*4 + x*6 = 72 colour strokes. Let x/12 = 0.5. Assume that (2*2) * x = 0.5 and let b/12 be 0.3. Assign y/72 = x*2, thus Alice painted x = x^2 + b^2 + x*3 = 72 colour strokes. Since the x/72=0.5, Alice painted 4*72 = 384 colour strokes plus 384 x = 16.4 colour strokes = 384 total.

If b<=5, she will probably feel excitement. Therefore, Alice b>=12. Let m be the number of new experience she had during the hour. So Alice had: 1 * 12 = 12*12 = 312 colours that she did not have before. So her coloured square is shown above. If Alice did not paint all her colours, we can say that Alice painted her filled squares about 15% of their original size. Assume that (1*15)= 15", "answer": "A: curiosity"}

He started his work on Wednesday, then on Thursday he arrived to home before his neighbors. When he returned home he had $150 dollars available for his bill. On the other hand, his neighbors had a bill of $250 which meant that they had less than 4 days left for their bill. Brad's first choice was to spend the money on the car insurance.

Accordingly, he chose to pay his bill with the remaining $50 dollars.\nOn Friday, Brad ran through his vacation funds all at once. He bought some food and drinks from home and spent the funds. He had left about $20 dollars in his pocket from his last vacation. By the end of the day he still did not have enough money to save enough for his remaining vacation. As a result, he gave himself the choice between buying the car insurance and saving some extra for his next vacation. He chose to buy car insurance. In addition, he changed his vacation to a much greater trip than his first choice. Therefore, he spent only $125 dollars on food and drinks for the next two days. In this way, he made sure that his neighbors have the money for their bill.\nAltogether - Brad spent $125 on food and drinks for three days.\nIn order to use his remaining money, Brad gave $125 to his neighbors on the 4th day of work.

He looked for new models at different prices, then finally decided to get a new washing machine at the lowest price. He measured the size of his new washing machine and the cost of buying the washing machine. Bill thought the new washing machine was too big for where his laundry room was. So he removed space for a washing machine, which reduced the cost by $70. The washing machines he bought were the same model, so after a few months, Bill decided that buying 2 new washing machines was cheaper than 1 new washing machine.

Bert looks after 12 of the kittens and Judy looks after the remaining 9. The kittens grow to full size in a week. Each day, Judy picks up three kittens, but Bert only takes care of the 13 youngest. For a five-week period, Bert is the daddy to the kittens only. How many times did the kittens get to play together, or nurse from, their father?\nOutput: 12 + 13 = <<12+13=23>>23 kittens.\nBert had 24 kittens, so his father's kittens will have a life expectancy of 40 years. They all get to live for at least 40 years.\nThen Judy picks up 5 kittens and puts them all together for Bert, so his father's 25 kittens remain independent of each other.\nThus 13 = [(5/13)*3], and Bert's father will live for 40 years.\nAfter 60 years, though, Bert's father's father will die, and Judy's will, leaving Bert alone with 15 kittens. How many years does this take for them to grow up?\nOutput: Bert may age with the 8 surviving kittens, and Judy with the 6 remaining. So 8 kittens (23*5) = 15.\nThen Judy picks out 3 kittens for Bert, his father's 21 kittens, so his father is the daddy to the 21 kittens.\nThus 21*15 = <<21*15=43>>43 kittens.\nAfter 50 years, Bert may grow old with 4 of the surviving kittens. Thus 23*25 = 55.\nAfter 75 years, Bert and Judy are the same age.\nThus 55*50 = <<25*75, 40==", "answer": "C: open ocean"}

If there are 24 meals then there are 6 people living at home for two meals each day plus one meal from the restaurant John is cooking them each night. John can cook all 24 meals when he has enough food in the kitchen and it will all fit in the kitchen. It is therefore possible that 3.1 meals are being cooked daily with John's food. John then has a total number of meals of 24 + 2. Therefore the total number of meals for John is:\nMultiply this number (24) times one of the following to get a total of the number of meals he is cooking at any given time:\n24 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 0 = 24.\nIf we do two of the following, John will have the same amount of meals for each meal, respectively:\n10 = 10^5 = 1 meal daily\n6 = 6^5 = 1 meal each day, twice\nSo John is cooking 10 meals each day (2.1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 0 = 8) with an average of 6 meals a day. So the number of days John has cooked each meal is:\n10 - 6 = 3.1\nTherefore, John will have cooked:\n3.1 meals daily * 2 days = 15 meal days * 2 weeks = 45 meal days\nAfter 45 meal days, John will have enough food at the house to cook:\n15 meal days * 1 weeks = 150 meal days.\nSo the final number of days John has to cook before having enough food at the house for him to live there will be 3.1\n\nInput:John has 5 friends living in his house.

{"text": "We looked at three car stations first. The first car station was in a small town that didn't have many people. The radio market for the town was very small. Car radios sold for $10 and the people who ran the station didn't make much money.\nThe second car station was in a city with large population and many homes. Radio stations sold for $50 and more. Radio stations also made a lot of money because most people had radios, so they all bought many radios and the radio stations made a lot of money.\nThe third car station was in a town with a very large population. Car radios sold for only $20 at the radio station, while the city radio stations made more money. More people in the town bought a radio, so the population increase also increased the radio station's radio market share and made the radio station make a lot of money. The last radio station in the town was also the most expensive.\nThe people who sell radios all know each other. So, in a crowded market, which radio station with the biggest market share is likely to have the best returns?\nOutput:\nCar Radio Station - The Market Share is\n1. Car Radio Station - 30%\n2.

How many dollars would that be in the box?\nOutput: Assume the other people will say the same amount on the sales floor.\nIn the first week, each person said the same amount on the floor. So the total dollar amount for both is $2000.\nIn the second week, each person said more, so the total dollar amount for all three weeks is $3000.\nSo the total dollar amount for every week is $3000.\nIf each person says the same amount each week, then the total dollar amount increases as their speech on the sales floor increases. Suppose each person said the same message 20 times, how much would that be in the total dollar amount in the box?\n5x", "answer": "C: shop"}

He then buys two. He does this to save on shipping. However, he buys more than the usual 2 popsicles. How many jelly bean popsicles did Michael buy?\nOutput: We should see two jelly bean popsicles in the first box. The second will have one. The results show us that Michael bought 2 packs of jelly bean popsicles and ate one the first day. Then, when he got them back, he ate two more packs. He eats the whole pack in one day, and eats 2 more packs within 2 days. So he ate 2 + 2 = 4 jelly bean popsicles.\nNext, we should see 2 jelly bean popsicles in each of the second and third boxes. The results show us 4 jelly bean popsicles in those boxes, so 4 + 6 = 7 jelly bean popsicles for the day. So there were 7 jelly bean popsicles in total.\nIn total, we have 7 + 4 = >14 jelly bean popsicles. Michael ate 14 + 4 = >42 jelly bean popsicles for a total of >40 jelly bean popsicles for one day.

How many cookies are in the large refrigerator?\nSo the final answer: Six cookies (six + 3) = 17 cookies (17+6) = 17 cookies. We should find that there are 17 cookies in the large refrigerator.\nSo we have 7/18 of the total cookies made.\nSo the final cookie count was 7/(18+18+18+18) = 7 cookies\n\nInput: If it were not for the baby, a husband,", "answer": "D: grocery store"}

{"text": "We divided the brainstorming session into 2 parts. The first part, to obtain information, was 2 hours. The second part, to exchange information was 4 hours. We didn't really gathher any information\n\nInput: There is a river that runs through 3 different states - Texas, New York and Oregon. The average water level of the river in each state changes every 5 years. In each state, the river's flow is the same every year but it runs 3 times slower in each state. The water level is the same in each state, as is the river's flow. In the south of Texas, it runs 3 times faster. In New York, it runs 3 times slower. In Oregon, it runs 3 times slowly. How much time does the river stretch in each state?\nOutput: The river in Oregon runs 3 times as far every year than in Texas, and the river in Texas runs 3 times as far as in Oregon. In Oregon, the river goes 3 times as far in 1 year than in Texas. In Texas, the river goes 3 as far in 2 years than Oregon\nIn 3 years California's river will flow faster and longer than the four river in Oregon because the water in California will have more mineral and sulfur content, and the water in Oregon will be more polluted and less mineral and sulfur. (2 hours for each state)\nEach state has 7 years to change the direction of the river and each river has 7 years to adjust its channel. In 3 years, the river in Oregon will be 3 times as long and 3 times as heavy as the Arkansas in Texas. In Texas it will be 3 times as short and 3 times as heavy. In 3 years, Oregon will be three times as heavy as Texas's river.\nIt turns out that the four river in Oregon all flows at the same rate for 3 years. In 3 years, they will all flow at the same rates.\nIn 3 years, the flow in California's river will change so much that the water will be changed three times. In 3 years, New York's river will change so many times that it will be changed as many times as those in Oregon. (4 hours for all four states)\nIt turns out that all of the river's flow is equal to 3 years of the river's 3rd flow until 3 years. In 3.5 years, Texas will become much heavier than the Arkansas in Texas, and New York will become much lighter than the Arkansas in New York.\nIn 3.5 years", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

Why were the cost for the cow and bull about equal? John said he was planning to get his own cow, but Sally said she would be willing to keep hers. The difference in purchase price was $15 for the cow and $45 for the bull. Calculate the difference in the cost for both purchases.

So, the total number of books on the bookshelf were 60 \u2013 60 = <<60 \u2013 60=20>>20 books.\nSince 60 books is less than 40 books, we divide 20 by 2 to get 40 books. So, the number of books on the shelf is 20*2 = <<20/(20)*2=40>>40 books.\nSince 10 books are greater than 40 books, we can divide 10 by 2 to get 30 books\nSince 30 books is less than 40, we divided 30 by 2 to get 7 books. So, we have 7 books, which are worth 16 dollars. In total, we have 64 books ($16 + 64) = $160.\nSo the final solution is 160\n\ninput: How many people were in this class?\nOutput: We want to know the number of people in this class.\nThe first person is: [0,5]\nThe second person is: [1,10]\nThe third person is: [2,15]\nThe fourth person is: [3,20]\nThe fifth person is: [4,25]\nThe sixth person is: [5,30]\n\ninput: [I'm ready for this]\nOutput: Do you", "answer": "D: web page"}

There are over 200 lions, and there are only about 1,000 tigers.\nSharks and lions have very similar life expectancies. Both would live about 65 years. Tiger attacks are less frequent, but still happen about every 2 - 3 years. Only about 45% of tiger attacks occur in India. Lion deaths occur around the world, but mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.\nBoth are mammals. Both can be dangerous. Both have a large population of smaller predators. Both are apex predators.\nThe average weight of sharks in the average tiger population is about 0.5 - 0.75 pounds, while the average weight of a tiger in the average shark population is about 2.5 pounds. There are about 25 humans killed in shark attacks around the world every year, while the average human fatality rate is about 1,000 a year in the tiger population. Lions are smaller than sharks, but still have the advantage of being able to hide in grassy areas and using their massive, powerful bodies to grab prey, and bite hard.\nSo the typical ratio of lives lost to total deaths from shark attacks is 0.7:1:1, with lions being much more dangerous.\n\nInput:  What would be the total number of hours of labor done at the factory if the workers were paid $15 per hour?\nOutput:  10.5 * 20 = <<10.5*20=75>>75\nIf each hour of labor costs $15, then the total number of hours done at the", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

She went out to get her kayak, which was a perfect fit for her. She began to do so, and was moving along well until out of nowhere she was covered in sand. She started to panic, and the wave washed over Kate, pushing it back, and she was dragged again. When the wave stopped she stopped paddling, and was floating in the sand. How long did it take Kate to get back to the shore? How far did Kate float?\nOutput: After 8 minutes her paddle was wet (and there were no sand patches). Kate had 9 minutes of swimming. After 1 minute of swimming she could see trees, so she got back on the kayak.\nWith 9 minutes of swimming, Kate finished with 9+1=11.9 minutes of paddling, so she ended up with 11.9 minutes of swimming.\nBased on the total amount of time it took Kate to swim the distance she was moved on her legs, and the time it took her to get back on the kayak, the final answer is 11.9 + 1.9 = 13.9\nIf there are still sand dunes at the end of her trek, she will be back on foot, and she will have 9.75 minutes of walking.

Explain by adding: number of tosses 2 + distance between two tosses\nOutput: Add numbers 2 + distance between two throws + number of tosses 2.\nSo if we add 2 + 2 + 2 + 2*2 = 8, then the number of tosses is 8 x 2 + distance between two is 8, and distance between two is 8 x distance between two = 8x2\nSo the total distance is 8 * 8 = 1280\n\nInput: The room was freezing cold and the boy shivering.

The milk from two goats is divided equally between 2 cows. How much milk is there in each of his goats?\nOutput: There is 1 cup of goat milk, 2 cups of cow milk, 1.5 cups of milk from a goat, and 1.25 cups from a cow\nWe can calculate how much milk is present in each of those 3 cows.\nOne cup of goat milk = 2 cups of cow milk\nTwo cups of cow milk = 2.5 cups of goat milk\nOne cup of goat milk = 3 cups of cow milk\nSo one cow + goat milk = 6.5 cups of milk\nSo the goat milk has 6.5 * 6 = 21.5 cups of milk.\nSo the milk has 21.5 * 21.5 * 21 = 63 cups of milk.\nSince 63 = 15, 15 * 15 = 25, 24.25 * 24.25 = 37.25 cups of milk\n\nInput: 1 cup of milk costs 0.25 cents to make. 2 cups of milk costs 1.5 cents to make. 3 cups of milk costs 2 cents to make. 4 cups of milk costs 3 cents to make.

One man suggested that the man had a prostate problem. Another man suggested that he could have been diagnosed with a brain tumor. A woman saw the bulge of a testicle and suggested that it be surgically removed. The man was taken to a hospital where it was found that the man truly had a bulging penis who had not been exposed to many sexual activities.\nTo correct the man's problem, doctors inserted a cystoscope through an incision made in his groin region which was covered with skin so that they could gain access to the penis without surgery. He underwent surgery and after a short period of time was allowed to return to full sexual activity.\nTo correct other men's problems, hospitals and doctors have begun to produce cystoscopes that can slide through incisions in the legs or the abdomen.

A and B, are both good ways to pay debts and, C and D are both good ways to have enough money to keep house (except, maybe, D).\nHow many days in total did he think it was going to take to pay off the car loan?\nOutput: Let q = the total number of days it would take to pay off the loan and let r = the interest rate to afford the loan, then divide each number together. Let r = 0, let q = 3, let 1 = 20, let 2 = 0 and let 13 = 5. We only have 5 days in total to cover the loan. So total hours divided by 1 is 1+(q*2)-0 = 8 hours or 0+8/(q*2).\nHow much did his bills run him each month?\nOutput: Let i = each month's total bills divided by i, then divide each week's total bills by the number of days in that week. This gives i = 30.\nThen i divided by 7 = 6= 4, so i divided by 3, so 4 = 13. Then i divided by 5 = 9, so 9 = 36. So 36 x 9 = 66. So the total hours he spent each month for utilities (including interest) were 66/6 = 0.52 x 0.52 = 7.05 cents a day, or 2.13 cents a day.\nThis means that he paid the loan off in 2.13 cents days.\nSo the final value for calculating the amount of money he spent each month on utilities (including interest) was 7.05 cents per day.\n\nInput: Adam has 45 books.

Their first move was to move a card at the front of the card box. Their second move was to move the card at the back of the card box. The third move then required them to move the card at each other's back. The first person with the four cards on the top of her car, the one with the two cards on her back on her car, and the third person with only the one card on her car, moved the cards on her car.

You know how many eggs each box holds. You also know that if you open one egg at a time, one egg will hatch at a time. How many chickens does this make?\nOutput: The number of chicks would be 3 - 1/3 = 3 in the first box.\n3 + 1/3 + 1/3 would be 1 + 1/3 = 1 in the second box.\n1 + 1/3 + 5 + 0 + 5 would be 5 in the third box.\n1 + 3/5 + 1 = 1 in the last box.\nSo the final number is 1\n\nInput: Your friend wants to buy a new car, but cannot afford a $20,000 car. Do you offer to sell him a $10,000 car?\nOutput: We find that $10,000 is a lot less of a loss than $20,000. So we will not sell him that car.\nInput: Three people have four chickens each. Each one has 16 chicks. The number of chickens divided by 16 will be 4. Which 2 chicks will you buy so that the total number of chickens will be 16?\nOutput: Assuming that each person has 4 chicks, each chick has a 4- 1/2-1/2 chance to hatch, so you buy 2 so that the total number will be 16.\nSo the number of chickens you buy will be 16+4 = <<16+4=45>>45 chicks\nAlso, remember that the total number of chicks you buy is 16 + 2 = <<16+2=54>>54 chicks.\nSo the final total answer will be 3 chicks\n\nInput: How many eggs do three chickens hold?\nOutput: Four = <<4*16=44>>44 eggs\n\nInput: The average monthly rent on a two-bedroom apartment in London is $1,080.

{"text": "Choices: A: stripes B: seat belts C/3: breaks to help stop/D: tires\nIn a car we first look at which type of light you are coming to.  The stripes, that run the length of a car, add height so we know by how much height (distance) we must slow down from a stop.  At the same time our seat belts and brakes help us to avoid sudden stops and we use radio to guide us out of tricky situations.\nSo this time we can look at the total number of trips in a car.  That tells us the number of journeys taken by the car.  Those are the number of times we can break it down into three trips.\nThe number of trips is the same as the number of trips taken.  Therefore you can figure out by counting the number of times seats and brakes break down.  At the same we can look at the number of trips taken by the total vehicles that make up the car and we can find out how many miles that we can cover in one trip.  Therefore you can see that all the options are very similar.\nThat says that it is possible to drive around our cars in a circle and we can see how efficient our cars would be at that.  This example shows how efficient our cars would have been if a car had a radio and a steering wheel so they could make all their decisions on their own.  It only gives us a rough picture of the efficiency of the car.

They need a car that could hold 4 or 5 and can accommodate two passengers. A few weeks ago they had a big truck that was able to hold 6 passengers comfortably. The price is $10,500, but they don't know if it was ever used. Could they find the smaller car that they need with the money Jane earned from selling her car or could they find the bigger car and the extra seats with the extra money they made from selling her car?\nOutput: Jane earns an additional $10,000, so she would have total income of $20,000, leaving her with $11,000 to rent the car. The new car still would be $10,500, so Jane only has $11,000 to hire and buy the car. But $10,000 would be more than enough to buy a smaller vehicle for her husband and himself.\nSo Jane might need $10,000 more to hire a car and rent a car. Since one $10,000 is $10,000, then Jane needs $10,000. Since there are 2 car buyers, then it only takes $10,000 to hire 2 cars. Thus their total will be $10,000, including $8,000 for a car and $5,000 for seats ($11,000 minus $7,000 for a rental car).\nTherefore, their total amount is $11,000 minus $8,000 for the car so there should not be a problem at all, and they can rent it.\nSo the final number should be $10,000 minus $8500\n\nInput: Fred and Jane bought 4 acres near the lake for a ranch.

{"text": "This isn't as simple of a problem as it seemes as there are many factors in play. First, tidepools can be impeding the crab. We can count the number of times the crab is forced to move around by other crabs which will account for a lot of the movement. However, tidepools can also be helping the crab by creating little areas to hide from predators. If we take a look at the diagram below, we can tell that tidepools and crab can definitely work together to help out the crab. In addition, tides and currents can also make crab move more slowly or less quickly which can definitely help.\nNow lets look at the crab, he is scuttling because tides can make him swim slower. If currents move more slowly, the crab would swim less often and also would have less room for maneuvering and then would have less chance of survival during a storm and tides. Thus the crab is trying to stay safe. A lot of factors can affect the crab's decision. If we put too many conditions into the equation and say the crab is deciding between tidepools and currents, then his decision making process could become convoluted.\nThe problem is that in this example, our goal is to answer how many boxes of cereal did the crab buy, so each box represents how many boxes of cereal that the crab bought. The answer is 3 boxes of cereal,\nSo the final answer would be 34 boxes, which is 36 x 3 x 3 = 84 boxes\nWe also got 6 boxes of cereal from the sale of the crabs books.\n\nInput:Bobby has 4 chickens, 2 males and 2 females, that live together.

That is our starting chick, the \"hint\" chick is only for the hentai chick.\nSo our total chicks sold: 2 chicks at 1, 3 chicks at 2, and 3 chicks at 3\nSo", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

Everyone in the group had to hold up one piece of paper so everyone could be counted with only one number. Each person had to put his paper down once there was one complete member in the group. The total number of people counted is 40 + (3/4) + 3 = 37. What was the final total?\nOutput: It looks like it should read 37 + 13 + 3 = 38 when we get it all back, so the final total is 38\n\nInput\n\nInput\n\nThe solution: Input: Let the 3 teams vote for the team they'd like to be on each night. Then, for every member of that team who did not have a vote, subtract 2 votes from that team. So for Example A, if there were 2 people who didn't have a vote, then the team would have 4 votes total.\nOutput: If we have 1 group of 4 and 2 group of 10, then the group with 10 votes, A, would have the most votes total for the night, and the group with 4 votes would end up with less.\n\nInput\n\nThere are 4 seats in one row in the bus. Each row has 4 seats available, and each seat is allocated one vote per hour. For example, every hour during the day, there are 36 people in the bus, and the seat allocation is 6 votes per hour.

He then waits 2 hours for the next order. And so on. If the total is $10, it still counts as $1.\nSo:\n\nInput:An eight year old boy had an argument with his mother due to missing homework.\nOutput: After the argument, he took 5", "answer": "C: wrong house"}

The woman replied: 'It's a little sweet for my taste.' So he asked, 'How much would it cost to get some of yours?' She replied, 'I think I'll have to pass on that, honey.' He took her back to the pharmacy and bought a roll of gum to deliver to the woman in the candy store. He then asked her, 'You want the candy today?' The woman replied, 'I sure do, but only if you'll send me another box of your gum.' His reply was 'Surely this way we can be of mutual profit.'\nSo they went back to the candy store, bought a roll of gum, and delivered a box of gum to the woman, but she didn't want the gum either.\nSo next time you think about what to buy for the dentist, you might stop and think to yourself, 'What kind of gum would I like?' or, 'Is there anything else I could get that's more suitable for my individual oral taste?'\n\nInput:The kids will only be able to use cash to pay for things until their parents can get them a debit/credit card.

(This question will be hard to answer if more children than girls are born each year).\nOutput: In 1994, the women in Bangladesh gave birth to 3 million children.\nThere are 2 men in every 1,000 women from birth to marriage or death. That means that the birth to husband per 1000 women is 7, which is almost 80\nOn the other hand, the birth to father per 1000 times wife is 0.3. So there are 10 times more fathers in one woman than in 9 men.\nIf 5 women gave birth to a child, that child would be 7. That means that the average family size is 3.7. If 9 out of 10000 people would have had kids, the family size would be 7. So the question is really difficult to answer.\n\nInput: Four groups of workers are each assigned to 4 buildings.

How many square feet are on one square foot?\nOutput: We use this problem to see how big the earth is (since a square foot is 1/4 square foot):\nWe divide the square inch by the square foot to see how much square foot there is, then we divide that number by 36 to get the height of the Earth:\nThen we add 12 to the Earth's height to get one second's worth of distance, since distance from Earth to Sun is 360 degrees:\nThen take this time value: (360)/(360)/(360)/360 + 180/360 = 7.6 seconds\nThen we subtract 7.6 seconds from a second, and find out how much longer it took than 3 months:\nThen we subtract 180/180 = 7.5 seconds from 7.6 seconds, and get a day (we do this to see how many minutes a day the Earth goes around the Sun)\nThen we multiply 7.5 seconds by 9.5 seconds, and then divide 12 by 9.5 to get an orbit time for the Earth:\nThen subtract 12 from a month's time (this will help determine how many minutes a day it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun):\nThen get an answer (how many days it takes the Earth to go around the Sun):\nThen we tell 1 by 1 (so 2+2=5) to find out 1/4 square foot:\nOutput: 1/4 = 1x12>>12 = 36 sq. ft. (12+36*36) means 36*36 = 36 square feet, and 1 cubicle is 27 square feet (27+27*36) = 27 square feet.\nSo total cubicle area is 36 - 36 = 9.5 cubicles (9.5*9)*36 = 9.5*9 = 26\n\nInput", "answer": "A: redemption"}

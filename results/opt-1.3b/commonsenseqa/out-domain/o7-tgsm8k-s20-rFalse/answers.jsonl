{"text": "D\nExample: A - I've heard about the wonders of the human body before, but I have no idea of its role in evolution. That changes very quickly when I discover that our ancestors had the same reproductive abilities as other animals and that we had periods when we were in large numbers and had large reproductive cycles.    B - Nature and science make my life easier, but I'm not certain that science will make us a better species.    C - I used to believe that the only important question is \"What's best for my neighbor?\" as soon as I saw the human body for the first time. I then became interested in other scientific topics, and now I believe that learning more about the earth, climate, animals, and other organisms is important too.    E - I believe strongly that people are people regardless of the environment that they live in. No matter what I do in life, I can be friends, enemies, enemies, or friends again with people who live in a certain country, or another. They're all people, and no religion can explain away this truth. I believe that God is in control of everything I do, and the good things I experience come because of that.      F - I used to love to read and be absorbed by the beauty of nature and science. Now I am concerned about the human body and what causes diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. I have no idea anything about what's happening to those people who have these diseases, nor do I wish them ill, but I wonder why they are the ones who have to suffer. My opinion is that there will have to be some sort of investigation of the causes of diseases.\nExample: A - While I enjoyed science classes before I discovered that evolution, and the human body, are based on evolution, I would have never learned anything about the world, animals, birds, reptiles, and how our ancestors lived. The reason that I enjoyed watching the nature shows and learning about the animal kingdom was that it taught me both about the natural world and about myself.    B- Since I have discovered the theory of evolution, I'm not sure how I feel about the human race. I'm not so sure if humans can ever become a better species than they are now.    C- The way I see it, nature and science both make my life easier because I don't have to think about anything as deeply as I did before. I wouldn't have", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

How does Johnny determine that the police officer is a liar?\nOutput: 2\nIn this situation, Johnny's first choice was to lie.   But he didn't because he felt he needed to keep control of the situation.  If Johnny had chosen to lie, the police officer would have been able to tell him the truth and he would have stopped talking to him.\n\nIn answer:\n1)  Johnny lied because this is how he handles his situation.  If the police officer had lied, Johnny would have been allowed to start talking about the issue and not allowed to continue the conversation.  Instead, Johnny continued the conversation with the officer because without lying, the officer would have been unable to determine that the story Johnny was telling him was false.\n\n2)  Bill had also lied during the situation.  He lied to keep his power and to keep himself out of trouble.  If Billy didn't find out about the rape, he might've continued raping women.\n\n3)  At the end of the night, Bill lied because he had to continue using his power in the rape situation that he had created.\n\n4)  Nalani also lied because she had to continue selling the puppies to cover off her debt.  If her lying would've led to her financial failure, she would've stopped selling puppies.\n\n5) The only decision Johnny would've been able to make would've been to control the situation.  Once Johnny had the information that his story was false, he could've stopped talking to the officer.  If Bill had also lied, all three of them would have stopped talking to each other.  Instead, they continued talking after the officer said he believed their stories.\n\n6)  Billy lied because he had to live with the lie.  If he hadn't lied, he would've continued with his normal life.\n\n7)  The only decision Bill would've been able to choose would've ended on a lie.  Once he had told his lie, he could've stopped lying.\n\n8)  Billy would've probably only lied one time.  He wouldn't've lied more than that.\n\n9)  The last decision was because there was no decision yet.\n\n10)  The police officer had already decided before he got there, and he knew that Johnny and Bill would be telling the truth.

The origin of the words 'education' and 'education' are Latin words - meaning to teach (as a course), to instruct (about a subject), and to educate (about facts). This means that when we look at the words and find out they are derived from Latin, the meaning isn't really important.\nBut, in terms of the original meaning of the English word 'education', it is an important word, it was derived from the word 'Latin', and it was originally intended to mean the course of instruction (as taught) in schools - the course of instruction that teachers (usually men) taught.\nSo answer B.\n6.

This gives them all the energy they need to play and go on the trip. Once they return home in the morning they go into their rooms and put all of the raw meat on their plates. They then go play with the tiger on the floor. They sit and talk about their life before and after their trip. Then they finish their meal. This allows them to sleep soundly for 6 hours.

Tim and Kate have to thank God every day; they have to thank God each day for these kinds of things. Thank God that such great situations come about.

{"text": "E (best answer)\n\nInput:\nYour friend says he can no longer handle the relationship because his girlfriend is being too nice about his appearance. What should he do?\nOption 1 - He stops dating her. He could start dating someone who sees him as the ugly one. But who knows, she might leave him for someone who loves him, and so his best option is to be happy alone. The ugly person would probably find someone else though, since not looking at you is such a huge turnoff.\nOption 2 - He could work harder at looking better. He could get a gym membership. This would probably get more attention than going out to eat, which he would almost certainly continue to do. Still, he would still be overweight.\nOption 3 - He could stop caring about looks, and accept being the ugly duckling that he clearly is. It would also probably mean he would end up unhappy and not be able to get very far in his career. His best bet is going with option 2, only with a change in approach.\nOption 4 - He could go outside the dating world, and start dating someone new. Maybe he could meet a girl who has been through a breakup. That way, he may get a second chance.\nOption 5 - He could just stop looking at how ugly he is.\n\nInput: Two of the following questions are to test your ability to identify people by looking at their faces:\n1.)

'We need language to describe our world.'.'In the brain, there is a great learning of the most important information like human behavior and language.'.'The brain takes time to be functional.'\n. 'We need to hear and understand each other.'.'When the brain learns, it remembers very vividly.'.'Every memory is stored for a reason.'\n. 'The more neurons that are added to the brain, the faster it grows.'\n\nThe brain is a multilevel hierarchical system consisting of three tiers \u2014 cerebral cortex (centers), basal ganglia (middle) and striatum (lower), although many other higher-order structures such as hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus may have a significant influence on the function of the brain. In simple terms, the cortex controls actions of the body, the basal ganglia governs behavior, and the striatum provides input and facilitates communication.\nExample:\n. 'The human brain takes time to be fully functional. However, once the brain has completed learning, it becomes very powerful.'\n. 'People are generally very kind to each other.'\n. 'The main organs in the brain are the cerebral cortex, middle and lower regions, and thalamus.'\n. 'The brain does not only work with the body.'\n\nInputs: A and B are connected to the Internet and have two computers connected on both sides. After A sends a message to B, a message arrives from B to A.

Because of the high number of connections, a neuron receives very little information \u2014 a neuron fires once, receives and delivers signal, fires again, and so forth. The more synapses a neuron has, the slower those connections are, and the more information that gets fed to the neuron. The ability of a neuron to send and receive signals is called \u201cneural activity\u201d and it determines an individual\u2019", "answer": "D: museum of natural history"}

He stopped at Grand Central Station in New York City and then went to the local McDonalds. At Grand Central Station, the ticket agent said that there was a train scheduled in 20 minutes which was arriving from Washington and he could not tell him who the train was for or if it went to New York. He could not see or hear anything except, “train” and “New York,” so he figured the train must be departing from Washington. When the train started to leave, he made inquiries at the ticket agent. He then learned that the train he had bought at the Grand Central Station was a bus from Washington to New York, which had now been canceled and he could not get off the bus. Finally, the bus pulled off the station platform and the man was on it. He looked around to see if any other passengers had been on the bus and saw that two older women were sitting in the front seat. He approached them and said that the previous bus had been canceled, but they said, “How was that even possible? We took at least three buses!” When the two older women saw that he would not buy their bus ticket, they became increasingly angry. The woman who was sitting in the front said, “I’m going to punch your mother…” and the other woman said, “I could just kill you.” The man sat down and the two older women both said, “No. You have to pay. We did not buy this bus so you will not get away with this.” The man asked for the bus ticket, and they told him, “You just took a bus from Washington that was canceled and you’re trying to get off? You have to pay. You stole another bus and that is why your bus has no tickets.” They began yelling at him but then they said, “We paid $200 each, so you are the one who stole. We did not expect this today!” He responded, “Well I did. We only took two buses.” They said, “You want that refunded? Why didn’t you just return the bus? What if you get stopped by the police? Just say you didn’t mean it when you called your mother. You wouldn’t do that, would you? You wouldn’t go that far.

"Goonies" is the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. "Crayola" Crayon colors were marketed first as a tool to prepare children for school in the 1880's, but later became a favorite household product. Crayola has been around since the 1930's and the Crayola color is still in production and distribution. Crayola sold 1.2 billion boxes of crayons in 2009-2010. Color is produced in a factory in China. Crayola offers many color options. They offer red, blue, purple, orange, yellow, green, pink, black, and brown. Most of the color options are also available in liquid consistency. Their main marketing strategy is in high schools and in the arts departments. The goal is to sell the crayons to students through a system called “Crayon Art,” in which the artist gets a commission when the child makes a drawing based on the color, usually based on the Crayola colors. Another way to market color is in the school art competitions. The Crayola Company and the Crayola Art Association sponsor the Crayon Art contests. In many cities, the Crayola stores are the headquarters of school art competitions.<n>Output:<n><n>We can write these problems as:<n>1.

You do a lot of crayon art every year.<n>All of the problems will be on amazon, except the last one: you should write that number 8 times on amazon, because after 8 books you will have 80 books. That's why they have 8 columns instead

He was making some new golf balls out of old ones. He made six new balls before he noticed a hole in one. He was pleased with his new shot. He picked up one new ball, and threw it the same way. The ball flew straight up, right over his head, and landed six hundred feet away. He watched it fly through the trees, and it landed on a building about six inches away. He was very surprised. He saw the building, but decided not to walk straight up, and looked back at the ball. He smiled with a big smile. Then he looked down. To his surprise, he found out that the ball was made out of wood. He found a piece of wood in one part of the hole. Two holes were punched into the piece of wood, one under the ball and one underneath it. He was very happy that he didn’t just lose the ball, and that the ball would still be intact. He thought back to the last time he was near the ball. He said he didn’t remember seeing anything. He looked down at the ball again. It appeared to be almost all of the way buried. Was it possible that he just missed it? He looked back up as well. He saw two more holes in one ball. He tried walking to the building under the ball as he got closer. He walked towards the building and jumped five steps over the building before he went down. He saw a small hole that was about six inches under the ball. He pulled off his shirt and threw it into the hole with the ball. He looked down. The ball had no marks or burn marks on it. He looked back

Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n>Output:		       D<n>Example: A - I've heard about the wonders of the human body before, but I have no idea of its role in evolution. That changes very quickly when I discover that our ancestors had the same reproductive abilities as other animals and that we had periods when we were in large numbers and had large reproductive cycles.    B - Nature and science make my life easier, but I'm not certain that science will make us a better species.    C - I used to believe that the only important question is "What's best for my neighbor?" as soon as I saw the human body for the first time. I then became interested in other scientific topics, and now I believe that learning more about the earth, climate, animals, and other organisms is important too.    E - I believe strongly that people are people regardless of the environment that they live in. No matter what I do in life, I can be friends, enemies, enemies, or friends again with people who live in a certain country, or another. They're all people, and no religion can explain away this truth. I believe that God is in control of everything I do, and the good things I experience come because of that.      F - I used to love to read and be absorbed by the beauty of nature and science. Now I am concerned about the human body and what causes diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. I have no idea anything about what's happening to those people who have these diseases, nor do I wish them ill, but I wonder why they are the ones who have to suffer. My opinion is that there will have to be some sort of investigation of the causes of diseases.<n>Example: A - While I enjoyed science classes before I discovered that evolution, and the human body, are based on evolution, I would have never learned anything about the world, animals, birds, reptiles, and how our ancestors lived. The reason that I enjoyed watching the nature shows and learning about the animal kingdom was that it taught me both about the natural world and about myself.    B- Since I have discovered the theory of evolution, I'm not sure how I feel about the human race. I'm not so sure if humans can ever become a better species than they are now.    C- The way I see it, nature and science both make my life easier because I don't have to think about anything as deeply as I did before. I wouldn't have

Because you are old enough to help keep me company, and you have the chance to learn about the future by working on our home-made games.’ So the child buys a paper, ‘The Day That Never Comes’ to play with his new friends. The game, The Day That Never Comes, consists of having the boy and girl, Alice and Edna, think about something they have done and then get up, go to their room, and play the game. The book is only three pages long. Alice and Edna play, and soon one of them runs away. Edna finds the lost child. Alice says, ‘How come we never met? I lost her because I never thought the day would come. After all, my story is so much longer than Edna’s; we should ask for a copy of her story. And if she won’t tell us, maybe we can ask for Edna’s story instead.’ Alice and Edna each copy her story. The day that never comes ends up being a Saturday that the two girls had to make up. Then Alice tells Edna, ‘Did you remember to take the bus to my house?’ Edna remembers, ‘I forgot about it because I was so sad after losing our friend.’ The boys have no idea about Alice’s experience, so they are sure that they can play with her story after Edna and Alice have played each other’s story. Alice replies that she thinks she’s not old enough yet; but she can pretend she’s old enough to play with Edna’s experience. Edna is so excited that she is sure of the game’s success, ‘But you must be the boy who was lost here.’ Alice is confused because this is not her story, and she won’t allow that to happen. ‘That game is only a memory,’ she says. Edna decides to play her own story instead. Edna asks her friend to come outside to play so they don’t have to think carefully during their game.<n><n>Input: Nach

If the total number of cars is 1/2, divide that number by 2 to get the total number of people in the city, 2 * (1/2 - 1). If the total number is 1, divide that number by 3 to get all people in the city. Divide that number by 4 to get the total number cars that have owners (3) + (1/2 - 4). Multiply this number by 2 to get number of cars (4) - (3/2 - 1). Divide this number by 3 to get the total number vehicles (5) = (4 - 1/2). Divide this number by 6 to get vehicle (6) - (2) = 1/4 and divide by 1 to get vehicle 1. Multiply this number to 6 by 4 to get vehicle two. Divide this number by 4 to get vehicle three. Multiply this by 2 to get vehicle four. Divide this number by 8 to get vehicle nine. Divide this number by 11 to get vehicle 12. Multiply this amount by 20 to get vehicle 13.

He tells the officer what happened.  How does Johnny determine that the police officer is a liar?<n>Output: 2<n>In this situation, Johnny's first choice was to lie.   But he didn't because he felt he needed to keep control of the situation.  If Johnny had chosen to lie, the police officer would have been able to tell him the truth and he would have stopped talking to him.<n><n>In answer:<n>1)  Johnny lied because this is how he handles his situation.  If the police officer had lied, Johnny would have been allowed to start talking about the issue and not allowed to continue the conversation.  Instead, Johnny continued the conversation with the officer because without lying, the officer would have been unable to determine that the story Johnny was telling him was false.<n><n>2)  Bill had also lied during the situation.  He lied to keep his power and to keep himself out of trouble.  If Billy didn't find out about the rape, he might've continued raping women.<n><n>3)  At the end of the night, Bill lied because he had to continue using his power in the rape situation that he had created.<n><n>4)  Nalani also lied because she had to continue selling the puppies to cover off her debt.  If her lying would've led to her financial failure, she would've stopped selling puppies.<n><n>5) The only decision Johnny would've been able to make would've been to control the situation.  Once Johnny had the information that his story was false, he could've stopped talking to the officer.  If Bill had also lied, all three of them would have stopped talking to each other.  Instead, they continued talking after the officer said he believed their stories.<n><n>6)  Billy lied because he had to live with the lie.  If he hadn't lied, he would've continued with his normal life.<n><n>7)  The only decision Bill would've been able to choose would've ended on a lie.  Once he had told his lie, he could've stopped lying.<n><n>8)  Billy would've probably only lied one time.  He wouldn't've lied more than that.<n><n>9)  The last decision was because there was no decision yet.<n><n>10)  The police officer had already decided before he got there, and he knew that Johnny and Bill would be telling the truth.

You will know that if you have watched a movie about the life cycles of grains, or even if you have just looked at a rice cookbook. You can see how the grains get larger during cooking. This is called rinsing. The more rice you have enough to cook in one big bag, the bigger the bag. This is why you have more rice to serve for breakfast after one big bag. This results from one kind of rice having longer lifespans than other types of rice. To measure the dimensions you will have to be able to predict which type of rice you will cook in which size of bowl and how much you will make for the family.

What is the origin the word for “science”?<n>3. what is the origin of the words “education” and “education”?<n>*If you answer<n>A,<n>B,<n>C,<n>D<n>Answer B.<n>4. The origin of the word for "teacher' is the Old English 'tea-wee' (a person employed to teach) and the original meaning of the word 'teacher' is "a person who teaches." So it doesn't really matter what the original meaning of the words is.<n>Answer C.<n>5. The origin of the words 'education' and 'education' are Latin words - meaning to teach (as a course), to instruct (about a subject), and to educate (about facts). This means that when we look at the words and find out they are derived from Latin, the meaning isn't really important.<n>But, in terms of the original meaning of the English word 'education', it is an important word, it was derived from the word 'Latin', and it was originally intended to mean the course of instruction (as taught) in schools - the course of instruction that teachers (usually men) taught.<n>So answer B.<n>6. The 'and' used is a function word that has two meanings. The first is a conditional statement - what's important is what's not mentioned, not what is mentioned but it's mentioned; the other meaning is to connect the two statements, to show the connection.

After the two of them have been out a while, they decide to stop again. Since both people have the same route they take, the only way to get to home is to take a different route. It's an accident and the cars get stuck in the river. How are the two people to find a vehicle to get them home?<n>Output: B<n><n>Input: A boy and a girl live in a small village called Aakora. They each have a pet tiger, named ‘Gita’. They eat raw flesh from the tiger and then cook it, skinning it. Then they use the meat for all of their cooking needs, including a hearty meal every day in the week. This gives them all the energy they need to play and go on the trip. Once they return home in the morning they go into their rooms and put all of the raw meat on their plates. They then go play with the tiger on the floor. They sit and talk about their life before and after their trip. Then they finish their meal. This allows them to sleep soundly for 6 hours. How many plates, in grams, are eaten each day by the two parents and their kids? (Each parent counts as one.)<n>Output: 2,920<n><n>Input: A person can put up about 2 pounds of meat, 2-3 pounds of vegetables, or 3 to 5 pounds of fish into an oven or crock pot. They can also fit about 18-20 ounces of liquid, such as broth, on the side. Their oven is at a low temperature for 6-8 hours. The pot will then have at least 2-2 ½ inches of browned meat in it at the last hour of cooking. If it gets too cold for a while in the pot, it can be removed, but the meat will remain cold at room temperature. This cooking method keeps meat and vegetables from sticking to the side of the oven. The meat does not need to be in the oven, and the vegetables do not need to be cooked. Both the oven and the crock pot can be used simultaneously, since they are made for exactly the same purposes. Which method has the most energy value?<n>Output: B (energy equivalent to two cups of coffee)<n><n>Input: There were three boys who wanted to build a house.

How do a dog and a pig understand each other when they interact?<n>Output. 1 : The dog's vocabulary is small relative to its size. At birth the pig had two words and when the pig was first released from his enclosure at the meat-packing plant it was the only pig that had two words. When he reached four he started to say two words and when he reached six he started to say four words. What would be the most likely word that the pig could respond to in a context of the dog's vocabulary?<n>Input. 2 : After learning the pig had the ability to understand English when he was little the dog also began learning. At the age of four the dog began to learn a couple new words and at six was able to learn a couple new names. Both dogs and pigs are capable of learning one word or one series of words. What is the most likely language that the pig would respond to?<n>Output. 3 : The pig is a member of a species and so can understand the dog's vocabulary. In some cases this can lead to misunderstandings. Some situations where pigs and dogs understand one another: 1) the pig is in a car with the dog and they are both using both hands. 2) the pig knows the word for house as the dog knows the word for car. 3) the pig knows that the dog has a tail and so it knows he has a tail. What are the consequences in these situations?<n>Output. 4 : Pigs respond more to the dog's vocabulary. Dogs learn better when they see humans have mastered a language and so the pig must be taught to

This group church only goes online. The congregation has been meeting in the same place for 40 years. Tim has attended the group church online for just recently. Kate and Tim both think that these things are all part of God's plan. I know that Tim and Kate are disappointed to receive the message. They both agreed that they should not have had to hear it from anyone else. However, I think Tim and Kate should be thankful. It would have been difficult for Tim and Kate to accept such an awful message. Their former church is going to be closed soon. Tim and Kate will not be able to see Erin or Kelly anymore. They do not even have the name of their pastor. After meeting with Tim and Kate, I was a little skeptical at first. However, I started thinking about it. To get on this level, the church had to really be going through some serious trouble. And now, those troubles seem to be over. Tim and Kate have to thank God every day; they have to thank God each day for these kinds of things. Thank God that such great situations come about. Thank God that some of Tim's other girls, Kelly and Erin, have never had to deal with any of this. Thank God that Tim and Kate are still able to talk and get on board. Thank God that Tim is more open minded. I think this all is very impressive that Tim and Kate are able to remain thankful even after hearing such a hard message. I think I owe them a big thank you.<n><n>Input: This is a letter from my buddy Chris (I hope someone out there can guess his real name).  I like Chris. He always makes me smile.

'We need language to describe our world.'.'In the brain, there is a great learning of the most important information like human behavior and language.'.'The brain takes time to be functional.'<n>. 'We need to hear and understand each other.'.'When the brain learns, it remembers very vividly.'.'Every memory is stored for a reason.'<n>. 'The more neurons that are added to the brain, the faster it grows.'<n><n>The brain is a multilevel hierarchical system consisting of three tiers — cerebral cortex (centers), basal ganglia (middle) and striatum (lower), although many other higher-order structures such as hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus may have a significant influence on the function of the brain. In simple terms, the cortex controls actions of the body, the basal ganglia governs behavior, and the striatum provides input and facilitates communication.<n>Example:<n>. 'The human brain takes time to be fully functional. However, once the brain has completed learning, it becomes very powerful.'<n>. 'People are generally very kind to each other.'<n>. 'The main organs in the brain are the cerebral cortex, middle and lower regions, and thalamus.'<n>. 'The brain does not only work with the body.'<n><n>Inputs: A and B are connected to the Internet and have two computers connected on both sides. After A sends a message to B, a message arrives from B to A. Which of the following statements is TRUE?<n>The message arrived before the time it takes the message to reach the Internet.<n>The message from A was sent before B could complete the message.<n>The message from B arrived before A could send it to A.<n>The message from C arrived before A could send a message to D to arrive at G.<n>Output: 1<n><n>In the brain, each neuron is a connection to the next neuron in a hierarchical network that provides a form of communication. Because of the high number of connections, a neuron receives very little information — a neuron fires once, receives and delivers signal, fires again, and so forth. The more synapses a neuron has, the slower those connections are, and the more information that gets fed to the neuron. The ability of a neuron to send and receive signals is called “neural activity” and it determines an individual’

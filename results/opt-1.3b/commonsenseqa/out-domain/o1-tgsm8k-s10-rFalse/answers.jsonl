{"text": "0\n\n1 Answer\n1\n\nThe correct answer is C\n\nThis task involves choosing the answers, which is similar to the choosing of the right answer for a quiz. In other words, you will be given four choices, each of which are equal to a pair of values from 1 to 4. The only difference is one of these pairs is 'right': the other is 'wrong'. The choices are then presented to you from left to right. After you have picked the best answer from the four, you will have to explain which answer you picked and how you chose it.\n\nEach word must appear somewhere in each answer that is not on the previous answer. This will also create a 'rule' regarding the arrangement of the words (i.e. 'if there is a space between the word and the next word/phrase, then you can include that word as an extra character in each answer.). If there is a single answer on any single answer sheet, the rule must be followed.\n\nYou may have noticed that there are four choices. The question asks for an approximation of 3 kilograms of nuts and 10 kilograms of dried fruit. These amounts come from two different sources, the first was from Adam's shopping list and he actually purchased 2kg of nuts and 14kg of dry fruits, and the second was from a grocery store. You can either choose to be consistent and follow the rules laid out for three of the choices, or ignore them altogether and answer the question on your own.\n\n2 Answers\n2\n\nWhile I would say that it is more of a choice than anything else, it is definitely a choice.\nFirst, you will have four choices and each answer will start off as either 1 or 4. That leaves you with some room to use your thinking cap. To answer that question, however, I would say to focus on your ability to use reasoning, rather than logic. If you are presented with a given number (4), and you do not know what the real value would be (1), why not just pick the highest integer(s) within an integer range that you can work comfortably with, and then find out what the most common value is? Then, on the left side of every question, you will find that each available value has a common value for every integer between 2 and 10. If you can then determine for certain the most common value, you will see that there is a set of integer values that is closest to the real value, which would be in the", "answer": "B: respond"}

A wooden frame was placed to support the bridge. It was painted black. The frame measured 25 x 30 x 12 meters. The frame consists of 90 x 60 x 5 meters of wooden planks. The first plank, 25 centimeters in length, was placed at the corner. The plank is not supported, but a second one was placed further along. The top end is anchored into the concrete wall that supports the street. The other half of the plank has a slight slope and sloped a little inward. A platform is also placed across the bridge. It consists of 60 x 60 x 3 meters of wooden planks and was positioned in the ground at the intersection of the street and the river. Another plank is placed at the end of the bridge and is anchored into the ground. It is about 30 centimeters in length and about the same as the bridge. The second plank is placed halfway across the bridge and is supported at the top by a small rock. This bridge would have to reach the other end of the river at a 30-degree angle and be about the same size as the first one. A man walks between the two bridges and takes a measurement of how much they weigh. A graph is drawn which indicates that the man's length is equal to the distance between the bridge and the street.\n#2 - Using the information about the bridge weight, how far can I go before the bridge begins to support itself?

However, he has no intentions of selling the two stores, for two reasons: 1. He loves both of his parents dearly and feels that they would make good additions and 2.

{"text": "56\nA. bite B. lie down C. keep alive D. need to eat E. go to sleep\n\n### Answer:When the squirrel was tired, it bit its hand. This is called the \"gimpy bite\". The bite was painful, and the squirrel scratched its hand. This is an expression: the dog won't go to sleep no matter how tired it is.\n\nThere are many different kinds of animals who are called \"sloths\". These animals have slothlike bodies, slothlike hair and slothlike movements and often look like sloths in the wild.\n\nThe sloth is a relative of the porcupine. It is a small, carnivorous mammal. If it is tired, it will sometimes bite other animals who are more active and/or move more than it.\n\nWhen you ask a person what they were doing for Christmas, is there a chance that the person was actually watching the Christmas specials on television? I know that a few people who were very happy, were watching the Christmas specials! So what was they thinking was actually going on over there? It was an episode of \"The Simpsons\". Then another part was a clip from the \"Toy Story\". Then another part was one from the \"Harry Potter\". Some of the people who were really, really happy were watching all of them! (Not me). So why would you watch them all in one sitting? I think it is because you are too lazy to go to bed (at least once, when you finally get tired you just throw yourself onto your pillow and fall asleep).\n\nThe term \"sloth\" has grown on me. So much that I now use it quite frequently when talking about myself. So I'm going to use this for now. And the next article will be about animals called \"sloths\".\n\nI hope you enjoyed this article as much as I did. I know a lot of people think that I don't know what to write - that my articles are hard and boring, and that I have no experience with animals. I hope that you have found that all of that is just really, really not the case.\n\nYou have also learned how to find information about animals and to read about animals. What else can you learn about?\n\n### Example 1: Animal, Animal, Animal: Animal\n\nThis example of animal says quite a bit to me.\n\nExample 1: Animal, Animal: Animal.\n\nThe animal is an \"animal\".", "answer": "B: lie down"}

{"text": "44\n\nInput:The first rule of thumb is that an object is heavier when it is on the floor, and so is heavier when moving horizontally. If the object that floats is heavier than the body that floats above the floor, if nothing else, the object is heavier. The second rule is that this is so when the object is larger than the moving body. If the weight of the object is smaller than the moving body, the object is lighter. The third rule is that the object is heavier when the moving body has the same mass or is larger than the moving object. The fourth rule is that the object has the same weight as the moving object and the moving object has the same mass as the object. In this case, the object is heavier when it floats, and the heavier when it is being moved horizontally. In addition, the object that floats is either heavier or smaller than the object being moved. If the floating body is heavier, the moving object has a mass, and the object being moved has a mass. The fifth and sixth rules are that there is an equivalence between the floating body and the moving object, and that the body floating with the same mass has a smaller mass than the body being moved by the same mass.The seventh rule is that if the object being moved in each case has a mass and the object floating has a mass, then the moving object has a larger mass and is heavier. The eighth rule is that the floating body is lighter than the object being moved, and the moving object is lighter than the object that floats. The ninth rule is that the object being moved is lighter than the floating body. The tenth and eleventh rules are the same as the fifth rule, except that the floating body has twice the mass the body is floating over.The twelfth rule is that the motion of an object or of a moving body is the amount of force that pushes an object or a moving body from being on the ground to being on the floor. The thirteenth rule is that an object has a constant total inertia that is the same when it is in a constant neutral direction, or when it is in a direction that is either positive or negative compared to the direction that it is moving. The fourteenth rule is that if both the moving body and the object that floats are the same in inertia, then the floating object is heavier.\n\nIf the floating body is on the floor, the object is heavier, but this is not because the floating body is heavier.

The assignment was given to her to complete with due dates by the 16th. She was told by teachers that only those with high grades would be considered for the exam. After a few weeks, the school principal, Mrs. Thorne, came to the first grade classroom, announcing that there would be no assessment in the next few weeks. The teacher then asked the girl if she had the assignments, to which she replied, 'Yes, of course I have the assignments.' It then went to Mrs. Thorne who ordered a special test for the girl to complete. The teacher asked all the parents to confirm which child had received the assignment. The girl was then forced into the exam. Mrs. Thorne asked her students if they had received the assignments. When all of the children replied in the affirmative, Mrs. Thorne explained that her plan was that the school would use her observations to judge which pupils had done well, which pupils had had problems. The teacher ordered the child with the highest grade to sit for the exam. When the child was about to sit for the exam, she found an envelope containing a new assessment paper in her desk. The girl, who had sat for the exam, thought that she would be punished for the earlier assessment. Mrs. Thorne then told the class that the assessment paper was there in case anyone wanted to question her, and ordered a test for all pupils to complete. The test results, which were being analysed, would be used in grading. The girl was not happy about the test and decided to write to her teacher to complain. That night, she wrote a complaint to the principal, who agreed to write an explanation letter. While she was writing the letter, the girl was awakened in the middle of the night by Mrs. Thorne. The girl was then given the following instructions by Mrs. Thorne: 'After the class is dismissed, you are to write down every name that is mentioned in any letter you receive.' The girl was then forced to write down all the names that she heard Mrs. Thorne talk about in both her letter and in the class, the teacher was in no doubt that all the children had been called in. The girl was then asked to give Mrs. Thorne and the class a copy of the letter. She was then also given a copy", "answer": "B: north pole"}

{"text": "42\n\nExplanation to the answer: \"Where\" could be the room, building, or building block from which we view the room. Also, \"room\" could be described as the area inside the building where people gather around the table. (I think this makes \"room\" the noun while \"room\" is the verb. So the answer is right for the given scenario--a building has \"rooms\" rather than \"rooms in which people gather around the table.\")\nThe \"building\" could probably be the room as well. In the scenario I described, the building had \"rooms\" (e.g., 3 rooms in a building) as well as a \"room\" where people gather around the \"table.\"\nThe \"place\" could also be \"field,\" as an extension of the noun \"field.\" See the discussion on subjunctive verbs at the top of the question.\n\nThere was a house that had a basement and 3 bedrooms.

Also, the example does not provide enough of the question to see what the object is, but since you can click on the image you can see the object, so if you wanted a complete answer you could click on the image and see the object from another angle or look at the image sideways using magnifying glass.

{"text": "35 (The answer is C)\n\nI can't seem to figure this code... it appears to be using the form to select, and then sorting it. Is it an auto-sort? How did you deal with it??\n\nFor the first part of the code, you use an array to hold the values:\n[{\"n\":4, \"r\":10}, {\\varmin\":1}, {\\varmax\":16}]\nThen, you use the selector {1,2,3}. It will select a part in your list and sort based on these values: 1, 2, 3, etc.\nI didn't use an array for the second part because you have to put all values you input into an array before putting them in list.\n\nYou could also have just used the following code\narray(0,2,n) -> value 1, 2, 3;\narray(1,2,3) -> value two, three\nand it would have worked:\nvarm = array(1,2,n)\nvarmax = array(2,3,n)\narray(m, max) -> value four\n\nI am a newbie in Java, so my questions aren't that clear. First, I'd like to thank you for the nice tutorial.\n\nMy question was very strange, so the question is simple and I'm sure you're doing this for a lot of people (though I'm not).\n\nI think that 1,2,3 for the first part is the correct answer, but I also think that for the second part it's probably false. You could take (1,2,3|7); or even if we were to accept 3,5 and 6 (since there are 3,5 and 6 in the value set), then you should be able to come up with a solution: (1,2,4|7)\n\nBut this doesn't even make any sense. The answer is 7, no matter what 3,5,6 are (I believe), and 5,6 (since it's a constant).\n\nThe next possible answer would be (1,2,1|7); but again, this is nonsense (that would yield (1,2,5|7), which would be false).\n\nBut the next logical answer, that is possible with (1,2,2|7), would be (1,5|7)!\nAnd that wouldn't make", "answer": "A: port"}

When she answers her husband again, it is clear he does not care because he already decided to divorce her.  His next questions are directed to themselves.  He asks himself, \"Why would I spend so much time and energy to get her to give up the thing she thinks she must do?\"  After they are both home, their neighbor knocks on her door.  She answers the door and is surprised to see him, but he seems to be very surprised by his wife's decision.  When she tells him, the first thing he says is, \"What am I going to do with you now?\"  The wife tells him to take her to lunch and then to leave her alone.  He tries for hours to do this and when he does, he gets nothing.  Finally he convinces her that it would be better for their children if she does not return; she changes her mind about leaving.  When she leaves, she gets off the phone with her husband again and realizes what she has really done.  When she goes home, she finds her husband standing on the doorstep with a bouquet of flowers.

My understanding of the answer is that if you start with 3 x 4 as your answer, you get 9 x 3 as your final answer. We should then solve your problem to get 9 x 3 = 27. I don't know how I can come up with such an answer. It does not make any logical sense to me.\nAny help would be greatly appreicated.\nthank you.\n\nI found that it comes down to the following:\n\n 1. The more complex the problem, the less logical the answer is.\n\n 2. An answer that works for an arbitrary number of questions is not correct for the given question.\n\n1) We can solve with any number of solutions so the answer I am getting is not correct. How do I use those numbers to find the right answer?\n\nHi, I recently took a programming course with a group of other students and we have all attempted to solve this problem many times. The general rule I have found is one you will get from repeated efforts. The more questions you have to answer for a given problem, the better your chances of getting a solution. This leads to more than one solution and when you solve one question you can use that answer to find the answer to another question. What happens is that the more challenging you make the problem the more likely you are going to stumble on an answer for a given one of the questions. This will result in more than one answer for a given solution. I hope that gives you an idea of it. Hope you find some answers helpful.\n\nI think the answer is \"It depends on the question.\"\nThere is no real answer that fits your problem, as the solution requires an understanding of the function of the \"it's\" variable, and the variables that affect the answer to said function. You ask 2 questions, but you are making two different assumptions about the function your variables are taking. A \"it's\" can be viewed as a variable of this function. You may not be able to prove one of the above, but I don't think you can say \"you cannot have an all inclusive answer for this problem\"\n\nOk, I am not following you, here is my situation:\nI have been doing math problems for the past six months and still have not figured out how to solve the following set of problems for an average of six questions asked", "answer": "E: erections"}

Both the objective criteria, critical thinking and congratulated, are applied to assess their own performance and not so much their colleague who is doing the same as them.\n\n#2 Answers:\n\nA: critical thinkering\n\nB: congratulated, equal opportunity\n\nRaffles tickets are an equal opportunity and critical thinkering question in itself.

If they are an equal opportunity, this is the time to show what I mean, what I\u2019m able to do better. And if they are critical, then this allows me to judge the whole system of competency that we\u2019re dealing with, and find out what can be improved.

A critical thought helps them stay on-point with the rules of the game and also assess the current state of competency of others in the team. (e.g. A colleague who is currently on track might not want feedback on his/her progress, especially since they are on track, which means it may not be a good time to give them constructive criticism on where they need to improve on.) I do find that giving raffle tickets to people who are already on track or who have an equal degree of competency with others in the team helps in increasing their self-esteem and self-confidence.\n\n#5 Answers:\n\nA congratulating but critical thinking\n\nB critical thinking and\n\nC raffles and\n\nd congratulating and\n\ne raffle tickets\n\nI think I like to give out raffle tickets to those", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

{"text": "52 (5 points each)\n\nYou've studied the Chinese New Year for a couple of years now, but it's hard to talk about the significance of the event to you without being bombarded with questions about how to pronounce the name of the celebration. In fact, you've been learning in your Chinese classroom all year, it just seems like you're always in class. But what does the language really mean for you, what are the main values behind the celebration? Can you remember any events or people associated with the Chinese New Year that are particularly significant in your life?\nThis week, we're going to discuss just that - the message that the holiday is all about.\n\nToday, we want to encourage you to celebrate the holiday in new, exciting ways. You're going to create an action script for the first day of the holiday in which you use some of your vocabulary words (and some of the Chinese-English vocabulary words used in the past) to express a Chinese-language message, or some combination of words using some of your own vocabulary.\nYou'll learn how to do a lot of different things - what will you say? How will you write? What should you do with the time? And, most importantly, what is it you plan to do with the Chinese-language message?\nIn this week's post, we'll have you make a real Chinese New Year activity out of your action script, then talk about how to use your action script in your speech class on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nToday we're celebrating the Chinese New Year with one of our popular series! We're calling it 'Your Chinese Challenge'. This lesson will help build the foundation for using Chinese words as part of your speech or class work, and for the vocabulary words we will be using on this week. Your student will begin by learning about the Chinese Spring Festival itself - what will happen on China's newest holiday? Then he or she will create an action script to tell your class about it - you can have a discussion about it afterwards, or just use the action script as a reference page to learn some of the vocabulary we'll be using. Then we'll talk about how to teach the Chinese vocabulary we've just learned as we practise our speech class work.\nBy the end of last week, we asked your students to get in touch if they had any ideas what they would make with the vocabulary they'd learned. Here's what they had to say:\n\nThis week's lesson will help build the vocabulary skills used in your", "answer": "C: care for children"}

The whale is 4 times its whale body mass. Therefore the whale is heavier than him.\nB) This whale weighs 100 times his human body mass. Therefore he is 9 times his whale body mass heavier than the human.\nC) The human and whale are both 10 times their whale body weight. Therefore the human is 5 times his whale body mass and the whale is 6 times his whale body mass greater than him. The human is 4 times his whale body mass while the whale is 9 times his whale bwum body mass. Therefore the human is heavier than the whale.\nD) The whale is 8 times its human body weight. Therefore he is 24 times his human body mass lighter than the human. The whale is 8 times more than his human body mass. The whale weighs 48 times its human body weight while the human weighs 32 times its whale bwum body weight. Therefore the whale is 32 times heavier than the human. E) The human weighs 25 times his human body mass while the whale weighs 50 times its human body weight and the whale is 30 times its human bwum body mass lighter than the person. The whale is 4.5 times heavier than the human whereas the human is only 1.5 times his whale body mass than the whale. The whale weighs more than 50 times its human body mass than the human.\nF) The human is 25 times his human body weight and he is 100 times the whale weight. Therefore he weighs 25 times his whale bwuh mass and the whale weighs 25 times its whale human body bwuh mass.\nG) The human is 25 x his whale human body mass and he is 200 x the whale human body mass. Therefore the man weights 5 times his human body weight while the whale weighs 50 twice its human body weight and 100 twice its human bwuh weight. The human weighs 3.5 times his human body mass and the whale weighs 2.5 times. Therefore the man is 0.5 times his human bwuh mass while the whale is 0.5 times its human body mass lighter than before.

{"text": "54 Explanation: The cloths have not been arranged where the owner wants them.\n\nThe first question on the test is a very easy one, because the choices are simple, straightforward (A), and fairly obvious (B), so I think it's a great \"go-to\" one.  It also is very similar to question 8 of the assessment portion, which allows you to start on problem #1.  It's a great problem to learn from because it's the first one on the test, but you can think further ahead by doing the whole assessment after problem #1.  The second question requires a bit more thought, and as I already explained in my initial feedback, I think the \"do this, then that\" flow is more useful than answering questions.  Since it is an easy question and doesn't have complicated alternatives, I think it's a good one to use if you don't have time to think it through too thoroughly.  I'm giving you more space than before because there's a second question to complete after this one, and I didn't want you to miss that one.\n\nNext we have the most complicated and \"complex\" problem of the two:  Question 27a, which is the most difficult question on the test.  I tried to simplify the first question, by having the person just answer the first question and moving to the other two as they are presented to them.  This means you receive 2 sentences for each subject (since there are 24 total questions).  This means the sentences will be longer than most things on the test, by quite a bit.  I think this makes it an extremely challenging task, especially considering the number of possible answers it has.  There are 8 choices in all, and although I tried to limit some of it to easy/cheap options, I think it would have been more interesting if it had 15 or 20 choices...  The questions are similar to those found in question 8 in that they have many choices but no \"more obvious, more intuitive\" answers.  Most of the choice have multiple options, with 4 or 5 being obvious choices.  There is only one non-obvious choice that I think most people will recognize:  A)  The answer must be a dollar.  If you pick \"one\" you have to say \"that's not it\".  I found that a fair number of people made that mistake.  I think the easiest answer to choose would be \"B\")  The answer must be an orange", "answer": "A: linen closet"}

{"text": "Solution:\nFirst we need to solve the last problem. This is because by the time we have started speaking, the person feeling happiness has already put their lips on their cheeks. As a result we can see the tears starting to fall. It does look silly, but it\u2019s a common occurrence in happiness.\n\nNow that the person is feeling a little happier, we can move on to the next problem. It is a little trickier here because we have not seen the person before the laughter and smiles. Also, we have not seen how happy the person had been before the laughter, smiles or laughter. However, we can look at all of those to see whether they look any different.\n\nOnce we can see the situation from all sides, we can solve the next problem, which is whether we can solve that problem too. As we know, the person feeling happiness looks different before an angry face then before a happy face. Now we can determine how happy they were before the laughing, smiling and laughter. Using all of those different pieces of data before solving the problem is a way to try and improve our response time. We can learn more about the person who was smiling and laughing then before they would have smiling or laughing without ever seeing both faces. This way we can work out whether someone is feeling too happy.\n\nAs we see the face of the person we feel happiness for, it is important to remember that their eyes do need to be moving during their laughing, smiling or laughing. A way to help you see that moving eye movement is by using eye-tracking equipment. This is a device that helps us to track what things we are looking at. One technique that can help is the \u201cStress Test\u201d. The Stress Test uses a computer to calculate how much stress or time you are likely to have in your life without looking away from the screen. By looking at how stressed you are on the device it could show you a way to help you to relax.\n\nOnce we see that the eyes are moving, we are now in the position to tell if laughter, smiles or laughter are more happy then happy. So again we can use the whole story. After the story is said we ask you to remember the person before you smiled or laughed. From that point you can tell when the person is happier then before. As you can see, we have used all of the information in the story to help us determine where to go next. To look at how much happier they would have been", "answer": "B: love"}

{"text": "53\n\nIn this essay, you need to show that someone buying a rod in any of the examples above did more damage to a resource other than himself or herself than taking the rod home would.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to describe exactly how much the rod had changed the landscape.\n\nRemember, this essay is asking you to explain what can only be described in a very specific way. So the fact you didn\u2019t actually find the rod is relevant.\n\nYou should start by looking at the graph of the purchase price as a function of distance from you:\n\nThis graph can be confusing, but it\u2019s important to get this correct: it gives you an idea about how much of an effect an object has on the value of that object (or on some alternative). For example, the right column tells a story about how much the price of one kilogram of nuts decreased by if you were 100 metres away \u2013 so you see the whole story. On the far left we get an idea of how much nuts the rod would have cost if you lived in the middle of nowhere, so we see just how much of a difference it makes.\n\nIf one of your goals for the essay is to compare different values of resources and show how different values of two resources affect each other in various ways, then this graph will be very helpful.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think this is the right way to describe the graph of your purchase price, there are several ways to think about it.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s possible to do it this way.\n\nPut simply, when you have an item, and you want to buy it: \u201cYou want to buy a piece of paper, yes?\u201d.\n\nSecond of all, people sometimes say things like \u201cYou can eat a loaf of bread in one day and you\u2019ll be starving, but you could spend $100 on a loaf of bread\u201d. This is called the \u2018bread price effect\u2019.\n\nOn the other hand, the price of something might also change due to two other things:\n\nA change in demand\n\nThe availability of something else\n\nWhen you buy a loaf of bread, your income is decreased because you\u2019re getting one loaf for a dollar, but in the case of a rod, your income is increased because it\u2019s a more valuable thing.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart showing both points", "answer": "C: engine"}

After getting wet and splatted, the guy was unable to stand up again at the beach, he couldn't even swim!\n\nQuestion 11 Explanation:\nTo begin with, a sponge in the same shape as the one shown will absorb water. This is possible thanks to the chemical nature of a sponge that absorbs water. The same thing applies to certain sponge types.\nIf a sponge is held in water, it will gradually evaporate, leaving behind the original water content. With this process continuing, the sponge will slowly absorb more and more water, resulting in a sponge with a lower water content.\nWhen a sponge is immersed in the water, its surface will remain covered (or coated) by water. This creates a layer that acts like a sponge, and it will gradually soak up more and more water. This water will be evaporated again, leaving behind the sponge with a lower water level.\nFinally, the sponge's surface will be partially coated with a smaller amount of water, that will form a film that will slowly sink to the bottom of the water. This process happens because the sponge is moving.\n\n(To answer this question, remember that the more water that is in the sponge, the less the pressure on the sponge. The more pressure on the sponge, the more it will absorb. The more water that is in a sponge, the less it can absorb.)\nFor a sponge to be useful as a filter for water, it doesn't have to have the exact shape. The shape that the sponge is made, and the form that it is held in, will also affect the shape of the sponge. For example, to have a sponge work as a filter, the sponge's shape has to be similar to the shape of the bottle in which it falls. The sponge will be able to soak up more water, and absorb more water if its shape resembles the shape of the bottle. Likewise, if the shape of the bottle resembles the shape of the sponge, the sponge will be able to absorb more water if its bottle is held in a different shape, while still being able to absorb more water - this forms a type of relationship between shape and function that we will explore later.)\n\nQuestion 8 Explanation:", "answer": "E: splats"}

If they were both in the same group, who would be the first to read the second person's words? Answer:\nOutput: -\n\nClick to expand...\n\nThis is actually more like a question but anyway,\n\ninput: He bought his food at the supermarket, how much did he pay for each package?\nOutput: The first is 12$ and the other one 13$\n\nSo for your input, you need to figure out what the cost for each product would be. Assuming he bought the nuts at the supermarket, the most reasonable answer would be 11-12$ each pack in most cases because the nuts were probably cheaper in the bulk section (unless they were already half-eaten, but even with that, 2.5 is still a lot of nuts). For your out of the box answer, I think it's a good one, because it's just two products, they are almost identical, so 1$ per package is a reasonable price. For your out of a box answer, you also need to figure out what was the bulk price of the fruit, which you should be able to figure out on the basis of what the price of the nuts were after buying all the supplies.\n\nInput:You are travelling to a city in Australia,where can you get the best fish? Output: He said he would go to a river near the city,he bought some fish there. How much was he paying per fish on average?\n\nInput:How many dollars would I need to buy the food to bring to England in an 8 kg container? Output: The price of a kilogram of fish depends on how many kilos of food they buy in a month. A cheap one will cost you around 6-9 dollars, a moderately high one might cost 10-12 dollars. I guess they also need to pay fuel costs.\n\nFor your output there are lots of variables. The size of the container, the amount in it, the weight of food being shipped (per kg), etc. The amount of fish you buy in a month, if you are travelling in Australia, would be around 2 to 3 kg, though it is also possible they bought enough to feed two people comfortably. The fuel costs would probably be negligible.", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

{"text": "56\n[answer at top of post]\n\nComments on this weeks topic\n\nYou may or may not know this, but when it comes to eating raw fruit, apples, pears, cherries and grapes can be very dangerous to eat unprocessed. The apple and the cherries have enzymes in them that oxidize the vitamin C causing it to go rancid, so when eaten in an unprocessed form a small piece can potentially explode. Anyways, the fruit is already very toxic to eat and this is not good either, although I suspect you'll be pretty safe with just a small piece.\nThe other thing, when eating the cherries and especially the apples you should be aware that you are eating something that gives off a very weak acid reaction to the body, even just a tiny piece of raw fruit will burn some of your skin.\nMost fruits and vegetables with acid in them are best avoided.\n\nAlso, the red in cherries actually helps digest the fruit better thus preventing it from going rancid\nThe only fruit that doesn't have it is the pineapple\n\nI heard a great rumor that an apple a day keeps the doctor away. Well, it's true for some foods as well, and this goes for fruit. However, fruit still contains some sugar so if you eat a huge portion of fruit you can start to see a lot of weight gain. So eat a little while every day instead of just an apple.\n\nThis goes further then your statement about apples. If you eat apples at the right time in the morning (like when you wake up and start to eat breakfast), they are actually very helpful. It helps you lose weight, and they are very helpful with a heart condition, and some types of cancer as well. I mean, I've heard of people losing 15 lbs in a few days.\n\nOh, and when eating apples just eat the center. The skin around the center is full of fibers which can help you with weight loss. I've got a coworker that goes through a whole box of apples every week trying to get rid of all the fat off her body.\n\nMy dad, when I was younger, used to say that an apple a day can really help keep it off. He was right, but not 100% right. The reason apples are full of good fats is that they have anthocyanins in them (the color) and the skin also contains high levels of quercetin, something that can help prevent obesity, heart", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

{"text": "14\n\nThe last three questions are so stupid and make no sense\n\nThe last question is stupid because the answer is always either happy, glee, smoke, or stress relief. No one could be happy at that place.\n\nAnswer:Glee.\n\nThe problem isn't that the last question makes no sense, it's that every other question is asked and the answers to those questions make no sense. Also, the answer is always either going to be happy or glee. Someone saying \"I had a funny moment\" is going to be glee or stress relief. Someone saying \"the sun's out, let's go to the park!\" Is going to be stress relief or going to be a happy memory.\n\nNo. 1 answer: I hate these questions. The worst part is the fact that they have to repeat questions back. I think they should ask you one by one. But still, it's stupid. That last one isn't even a question, it's just some meaningless nonsense.\n\nI agree that each answer is different. Maybe that shouldn't be an issue. So, maybe you could use 3 different types of answers. One would be a single-letter question, two-letter question, maybe a three- or four-letter question, maybe two-letter answers, or maybe a phrase like \"If you had 3 kilograms of nuts and one kilogram of fruit, wouldn't they cost $7.88?\"\n\nIt would be like a puzzle, and a good one at that.\n\nOn a more professional note... that would probably be hard to code, and they didn't want to program it all.\n\nIn my opinion, I thought that this was the best of the questions. The first one could use either of the remaining two answers depending on the circumstances; one might be \"I had a funny, happy moment,\" the other might be \"I had glee/stress relief\" or something, I'm not sure. It wasn't really a long, but it was short enough to be worthwhile to remember.\n\nThen, for the last one, I thought it was going to be \"There was a kid being mean to me today,\" but I guess the last question wasn't as funny.\n\nIn any case, the first one was the best. As for the next two, I have the exact same issue. No real reason, just really stupid to repeat a question. And the last one was just silly.\n\nThe last one", "answer": "E: may laugh"}

{"text": "D\n\n### Response:1) In a small city like Singapore, you can buy anything you want easily. This includes vegetables. When you are shopping, you will see all the types of vegetables before they are sold out. A) This is the case with most Asian groceries where vegetables are shown in all their glory as you browse through the shelves. When you look closer at the vegetables, you can easily see the cost difference between some vegetables that are similar color. B) Most supermarkets only stock one type of vegetables, such as lettuce. This is because many vegetables require more space than the price they cost. C) In the big supermarkets in bigger cities like Europe and in the big supermarket chains in America, you will find a variety of vegetables to choose from. It can get confusing at the store if you want to choose a specific vegetable at a specific type of produce shop, so you end up making many mistakes while shopping for your meals. D) This is true in some major cities. A supermarket may be crowded in a certain area, but you will find it easier to shop in a shop like \u201cGourmet\u201d in a small city like Singapore. When you go to the supermarket in the big city, it is rare for you to find a shop like \u201cVintage\u201d, because many people will probably shop in a bigger supermarket nearby.

One wants to choose the easiest and fastest way of getting a ball to its desired position in space. The rules are as follows. The faster it moves, the more weight it exerts on its ball. The goal is to have a ball of the same length of the racket when all the balls are in motion. The simplest method of getting the ball to the desired spot in space is to push the ball along a string until the point of contact with the ball is reached (a push of one ball would reach the center of the universe). When the ball has reached this position, it is expected to slow down and rest at the end of the string. If the ball is moving and stays there, it will weigh more than 2 grams. The first ball must be picked faster than the fastest. Once this is done, the ball may not be displaced. The ball must also reach rest at 2 grams of motion during the entire process. How fast should one pick the ball?\n\nInput:In this experiment the students will find if a given animal can go for a long distance under the condition that one has food on a continuous loop.

{"text": "50\n## Answers:B- D- B- E-\n\nThere are 5 different choices in each question: A, B, C, C, E. The questions were hard because the number of ways to answer varied depending on which category you were in. In this case it might have been beneficial at least to list the categories. The answers were all random, so it was probably not a good idea to guess anything. You wouldn't get a high score from guessing! You were given 15 seconds, and when the timer stopped you had only 15 seconds to find out what was in the different category choices. You would then have 5 seconds to figure out what value each category had.\n\nThe last question had 5 different choices and 3 different rounds. The answers had a positive or negative numeric value. In the first round, you received a 1-5 value from 0 to 5, and you got all numbers 1-5. In the second round you received 4 to 5 numbers from 1 to 5. In the third round you got 3 numbers and 1 number. Your final round was similar to the previous three. Now you have 5 different values 1-5, and you get them from 1-3. This problem is similar to what happened to \"A Song of Ice and Fire.\" We have a book that we need to review. A character named George R.R.

The first question asked if you were in 1st grade, 3rd grade, 5th grade, 7th grade, and 10th grade. To get the right answer, you had to figure out how many different answers there were in each category, and then give an answer for each one. In the category answers, there were 5 categories, 3 rounds, and 3 values (1-5). This problem could be hard to pass if you didn't have the right answer in mind, which meant that everyone failed it, even if one person answered the question correctly. It would be better if we could get an answer for the first category in the first round, instead of asking which three answers we would get in the second round.\n\nHow did all of the choices lead to the 1st answer being the correct one?

{"text": "54\n\nInput:In the following sentences, your teacher asks you to describe the advantages of using a single word instead of two, which you have just written. All words must be written in capital letters and each have a positive adjective of the verb used to describe the adjective. The following two sentences represent a sentence that begins with an adjective and ends with the action of putting the adjective on the noun.\n\n(1) \"It is extremely difficult to play soccer with these large balls.\"\n(2) \"It is extremely painful to be forced to put on one of these shoes.\"\n\nWhat does this sentence mean?\n1. the verb has an adjective that makes it an object - the example sentence is from the sentence (2), and it is a negative action\n2. The noun is an action. the sentence (1) starts with the adjective and ends with the fact that they were \"extremely difficult\" to play with\nNow look at (1). The verb is referring to the verb act and when the adjective comes in it makes it a noun \"extremely difficult\", and the noun \"difficult\" needs to be put on something, which is to the noun \" Soccer\". This is the second sentence, and it would have been much better if it started with the adjective \"painful\", and it ended with the verb \"to be forced\", which is the action \"to put them on\". Now look at (2). The verb is referring the verb of the word \" shoes\" and when the adjective came in it made it a noun \" extremely painful\" and the noun \"painful\", which is to the noun shoe means \" extremely painful\". Notice that the verb of this second sentence does not refer to the verb of the word soccer, but rather to the verb of the verb act. In my opinion, this sentence is much better with only one verb, only one noun and only one verb, and it is certainly a better sentence than with a verb, noun and adjective, because I think it makes more sense this way, and it is less confusing.\n\nInput:Two cars drove back and forth across the street for thirty minutes.

If A and B were each on their own line and B was a whole dollar, then A would be $1 after A subtracted what was not a dollar. So for example, say you had $6.50 and you were given three penny's, this would be:\n$6.50 + $1 = $7.66\n$7.66,$5.10,$2.75 would all be $7.99\n\nNote on how it works\nIf you find a multiple of the price of one object and divide it by the price of an object, that will give you how much it cost to buy the object.\n\nExample:\n- 5", "answer": "B: try to learn"}

In a game where the players have to guess the order in which the candidates will be presented, where the most likely candidates always start, it's reasonable to think that the most likely order must be the order presented first.\n\nAs it turns out, there are two solutions. One is one person answers with first candidate. The second is for the first person to guess who the second candidate is. The voting order for this game is as follows:\n\n1) It's pretty obvious that in this game, whoever has the most votes wins. However, I think a more interesting way to play for a first time player is to add players that have more votes. The first person's vote would then be the vote of one of the players, so it would be easy to win but in a different way to that expected. I've never played this game in person, so I have to trust myself, I think it should be fun. If you have played this to your first time and you want to talk again, you can send me a message on the forum and I'll join.\n\n2) Since the two people with the most votes, and therefore the winner, are based on the last round and are very close and a large difference could occur from one round to the next, I think it's the simplest solution, even though it might be less exciting to watch. If you want to try it out, ask the poll host first, then you can join in.", "answer": "A: countryside"}

Choices 1) Very bad;  2) Bad;  3) Good;  4) Very good 5) Good 6) Good  7) Very good\nOutput: 6\n\nComments\n\nI thought \"good\" was the answer, even though you are the one making the rating.\n\nEdit (2/2/14): So there is a difference between \"bad\" and \"good\" and I don't know which teacher was rated as \"very bad\". I did a search to find out the correct answer and found the teacher's ratings from 3 months ago.\n\nThe right answer is \"Very good\", because 1) he is the one making the ranking system and 2) the teacher had high ratings, but was at 1. (I mean the right answer is as simple as that.) I do see where you went wrong, and I'm happy to help you fix your rankings: I've just not found the right way of rating teachers.\n\nThis is a great topic. The thing that worries me is that while some teachers might be below average (or \"below average\" I guess; I've just never seen that term used), the scores might be overstated by a factor of 10. But even if that is the case, the teacher will have \"good\" ratings, regardless of how poor his teaching is.\n\nI am having the exact same issue. I'm very new to this and I think I need to take more time before I make any definitive statements. I have a tendency to make blanket statements about things without actually being able to weigh my opinions and thoughts. The only one I can think of to put with your last statement is that perhaps people might not want to submit the same teacher multiple times, since you are assigning different ratings.\n\nI think one reason that the scores are high is because people don't want to report the same teacher twice, that is why you can get away with only reporting 1-3. The other reason might be that people aren't submitting the same teacher or the scores can be manipulated. That's just a guess, but it makes sense to me.\n\nThe teacher's rating should be good now; the teacher never scored as bad, because I've never had to rate any teachers like that (though they've all gotten good ratings, they don't have very many ratings).\n\n(You could argue that I should have done a search ahead", "answer": "E: row boat"}

{"text": "10\n\nThe question has to do with the cost of fuel in a town that you may not know exists. Your friend's answer is the opposite of what the question is asking. But if the question was only about fuel prices then you probably would have known that such a place doesn't exist.\n\nThere are times when I read something interesting and wonder what I am reading. This sentence is that moment. Nice work.\n\nWe don't know the town, but it is about 100 miles down the road.\n\nI think that a question like this is an easy mistake to make, but I think a lot of people make this mistake. We might think that because a town is named \"Town\", it must be a smaller town, a suburb of a larger town, or something else, but that is NOT what the question is asking for. As you said, the question clearly states that if a place is named \"Town\", there must be a smaller place called \"Town\".\n\nThe problem here, and not in this scenario, is that \"Small\". \"Small \" as in \"the size of a cow\" and not \"Small\". And most of us aren't used to answering with \"Big.\" We also ask for towns on the outskirts or the north side of town, because the town is on an \"inner loop\", so to speak. So, if the question said to name the town, \"Town\" but also ask that you name a smaller town (ie, \"Town X\"), then you could easily have answered \"Town X\" or something along those lines. What you DIDN'T do, however, was ask your friend to name some towns on the \"inner loop,\" so to speak, because you didn't know which of those towns he was referring to. That is what was confusing and what your friend made an obvious mistake in answering in a poor manner. In this particular case, the question was asking for \"a bigger Town\" (aka, the correct answer) and he answered with a question about the smaller town, hence creating a question for another person. In this scenario, the person is the \"smaller Town\", while you answered the \"bigger Town.\" So, my advice to you is to change the question, so that the question does not ask about \"smaller towns\". Because some people (not you) might have answered the question incorrectly and others (you) might have answered it correctly.", "answer": "D: big city"}

All those on the left side have 12's instead of numbers and they are a different species so you must be a different species from those on the right side as well.\n\nMy answer is a rather obvious yes, I have been told by many people that were told their lives on the Internet, but can you please explain to me what is the right answer.\n\nAs you can probably tell from the fact I have no idea what we all have on either side of our heads, but according to one person that I know, there is no \"left\" side, and that there is no right side either.\n\nThe correct answer to this question is that I (we) all have 3 different species because God made the sky and the earth \"one and the same\" so to speak.\n\nI (we) are made in the likeness of Adam and Eve so we are all very unique in our own ways, however with that said there are some traits that I do believe are the same, like the fact that we are all the same race.\n\nWhat do we have on our heads, in fact I think everyone has at least one thing that they have on their head, such as:\n\n1. Our hair, because we all have hair that you would expect people to cut it off at some point in their lives, but we all have our hair that we have not cut off.\n\n2. Our ears, also because we all have different ears on each side of our body but it's all different.\n\n3. Our skin (our skin color), because we all have skin that you would expect people of the same people to have the same color.\n\n4. Our tongue (which we all have and it's very hard just to say because sometimes it is hard to say what we would like to say without sounding silly), because we all have tongues that we do not like to talk about, and it's so confusing when you speak and you don't know what you are saying because your tongue just won't let you say what you feel is right or how you would like to say it.\n\n5.

If Adam's dealers charges 5,000$ for the first car and 1,000$ for the second car, how much should Adam receive for selling both cars separately? Outcome: 59\n\nResponse: If Adam's dealer wants to sell cars for Adam who owns two cars, Adam will have to sell cars worth 30,000$. This is because the Porsche 911 will cost him about 30,000$, while the Audi TT will cost Adam only 4,000$. If Adam sells a new car for 100,000$, he will get approximately 39% less money per car than he would have been getting if he sells the same car to the dealer. This profit is much less than the initial cost of the cars.\n\nInput:Adam works at an insurance agency. Adam sells insurance. The first time he is paid for a new car he gets 3,900$. Then he sold three cars but earned only 2,400$. It seems his sales rate of 3,900% is not quite enough to cover expenses for his agency. How many more sales did he need to make before being paid for all of his car dealerships. Output: 66 (1,100)\n\nSolution: To compensate all the work he has done at the agency Adam should get at least 100% of what he used to receive. An agent that works hard deserves 100%. It is not necessary to charge more than 100% of what he really earned since it seems he made", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

{"text": "46\n\nFeedback:\n\nThis is an example of a great \"problem statement.\"\n\nYou must have had some problems setting this question up, because the answers do not go together very nicely, do they? I would really like to take this as a step in the right direction.\n\nThe main problems I see here are the missing words \"be\" and \"cannot.\" The answer is right at the bottom of the page, but the question itself asks for a verb from \"be\" to \"cannot.\"\n\nHowever, the sentence I'm working on now is asking for a verb from \"what\" to \"cannot,\" so there is no problem with \"be's\" in this context. The problem that I'm having is with \"cannot's.\" \"Cannot's\" can be read \"not caned,\" which is not very appealing even to a fifth grader. However, there is \"cannot\" listed, and so the question is fine.\n\nI would also like to point out that there is \"will\" listed as a verb and listed twice. One of the problems I saw with this answer is that it could be read as either \"will be forced [to change]\" or \"will force [the character] to make this change.\" The second option is also a poor fit for the question and doesn't belong in the sentence.\n\nI see the problem with \"cannot,\" but there are two options to answer the question, so I'm willing to allow the use of it as a verb. The problem with the other two examples is that they are too weak. I would rather see suggestions like \"ask [other character] what\" or \"ask [character to] change\" or \"ask [other character for] this,\" or perhaps \"ask [other character about] this\" or \"ask [of character] about this.\" These are all stronger verbs, and these options are more specific anyway. Please continue to provide other examples and explanations of your responses to this question in the comments section. We'd also like to hear some additional ideas of how the character changes in your story.

This means that A will get the maximum credit, while C, D and E will be penalised.\n\nAnswer: A) The art exhibit that is the subject of this assignment is sold across four doors as part of a major exhibit of 50 similar exhibits which are grouped around themes such as religion, science, nature, etc. The overall theme for this exhibit is to inspire the young, which is why only 12 art works come out in red, yellow and blue while the remaining 40 entries are in neutral colours. The color red is associated with love and happiness, yellow with fertility, and blue with optimism.

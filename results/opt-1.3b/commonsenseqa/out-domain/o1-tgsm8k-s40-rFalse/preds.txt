After all, the answer to the exercise provides the question they were asked to solve. I don’t care what you think of the exercise, it works. Allowing the student to be the detective allows them to focus on the problem and get some help from me as they answer. There are a number of points in this exercise that I think are valuable for you to consider as you consider choosing an animal companion.<n><n>How To Answer Questions Correctly with the Answer Key<n><n>For the last few class assignments, the students each have a “key” that allows them to identify what is being asked. I have found that this is an effective way of solving problems. I have found that the key has a lot to do with the answers. I also know there are students who find the key to be a distraction. However, when I give them both keys and ask them if it’s all right if I mark them both it becomes a great lesson in learning to read. I also know there will be students using both keys which I believe makes the game a little easier.<n><n>By Marking Both Answers It Makes It Fun<n><n>For me to solve a problem, I usually like to have some fun with it. I don’T need to be the most brilliant scientist to solve the problem. Sometimes the fun in solving problems is knowing that the solution is possible. The problem could be as simple as what do drugs do, but if I am able to think of an idea to solve the problem it makes it one that I can remember for the future. You know, life is one big problem and the solution to that problem often is more complex than you think. Sometimes the answer to the question is right in front of you, but it’s not there. Here is a quote from one of my students:<n><n>“I want to be intelligent, but I have bad memory.”<n><n>“Wow, that is very clever!�

A truck drives slower than the speed limit so the driver thinks to himself "I wish I had a cop car to tail me so he couldn't keep up". When they reach the city they hit a stop sign and then merge in between two lines. They see a cop car behind them but the man in the car says "Don't worry, I got you covered." A cop car appears and the man looks through his window at the cop car. He tells the driver to pull over, which the driver does. They see no real cops as they merge into a traffic light. The man in the car says, "Look, I'll bet that cop is going to pull over now," and the driver says, "No way, he'll think I blew a stop sign." As the cop car approaches the car it slows, and the man in the car shouts "Look, I blew a stop sign and so did you!"

However, there are some exceptions. Doberman puppies tend to become aggressive when left alone for a long period of time and when stressed. This can be aggravated by loud noises or other loud circumstances.<n>If the dog is left alone for a long time, it can become extremely aggressive and could be vicious. Dobermans frequently become fearful of strangers. The fear can be because the dog has a history of being abandoned or abused. Therefore, it is important for the puppy to be shown as a puppy. Although aggressive dogs can be easily tamed, it is important for you to establish a good relationship with the dog to avoid the dog becoming aggressive. It will also help with the puppy’s behavioral problems.<n>Although there are certain specific times of day that Dobermen can become aggressive, they are usually more aggressive at night or late at night. Aggressive dogs are normally found in large pack settings. Therefore, it is possible to establish a group for the Doberman, but the pack might be a bit overwhelming if it is a large, independent pack where a high degree of individual control is needed.

The first one is that dogs are like humans, very emotional animals, and this emotion comes out in their canine companions. For most Doberman puppies, their early experiences are often very positive and at the age of 1 to 3 months, the puppy can understand and communicate with humans and many others, but there will be challenges for the puppy to overcome to be more empathetic. Some of their challenges with socializing are being the only dog in the house to react badly when one of the owners cries, or when one of the owners gets upset at not hearing every detail about each day's activities. The puppy is also more likely to have ear infections at the age of one month than humans. When they grow up as puppies they can learn many things, such as the importance of their family, and the care and security of their owners, but they are still at a very young age to fully comprehend the meaning of their responsibilities. Their loyalty to their owners is demonstrated when they will run into their owners home to attack them, but will only bite if the dogs owner is not nearby. The puppy is extremely loyal.<n><n>Output:<n>"How many Doberman puppies are there?"<n>"Where are their parents?"<n>"Are they going to have puppies?"<n><n>Output:<n><n>Output:<n>Barking like a seal.

To understand this answer, think about the number of people working together for 5 less than 3 times the number of people for 4 less than 3 times the value of 5 plus the difference between the 2 and the 20. If this works then there are 52 people working along for 5 less than 40 times the value of 4 minus 20, and the number of people employed has to be 60. Now subtract 30 from 0 to get 45 because 30 is the number of times you're adding 15, then subtract 30 from 45 to get 45 again. But let's look at what happens next.

B: Mastiff C: Boxer<n>Output: A - C - D<n><n>Doberman is the name most commonly given to the breed of dog that is an offshoot of the German Schnauzer. A well-formed short-haired Doberman is known as a dachshund; a short-haired dachshund is called a poodle; and all other breeds are called standard dachshunds or standard Schnauzers.<n><n>Origin of Doberman<n><n>The exact origin of the Doberman is uncertain. There are some theories, two of which are very similar: 1) that the breed's name comes from German dachshund (a dog that was used to dig holes); 2) that the breed's nickname derives from a German phrase dauerhaft ohne zum Schluss, which translates as long-suffering, and indicates that the dogs might have some kind of difficulty in getting used to the demands of work. Another common theory is that the breed was named by Adolf Hitler as an anti-German dog, to suggest a dog's loyalty to its mistress (i.e. Adolf Hitler). Hitler was said to have made the dogs' name Doberman and used it as a disparaging term for the German people. This theory was used by Adolf Hitler to suggest anti-Semitic tendencies in Germany.<n><n>Theories<n><n>The origins of the Doberman are as varied as its dog breed. Some theories, such as the first, suggest that it came from a species of dog known under the name "Schnürzer" which has the appearance of a miniature German shepherd combined with a long coat. Alternatively, the most common theory is that the Doberman came from the Dachshund, which was one of the many canine breeds created by the Germans during the 19th century to fight against Napoleon in the Franco-Prussian War. The first known Dachshund was invented by Johann Friedrich Pfefferkorn in 1825 in Bavaria. In 1831, the breed was adopted and named after Napoleon by General Otto von Börner.<n><n>In the 19th century, the Dachshund was used primarily as an anti-French dog, due to its small size (compared to the French, which is what is believed to be its real inspiration), the fact that no French

If you wanted to work out on your own, you would have to find a place to do so. Another thing is that you will probably only be able to work out for a short period of time. If you are willing to work out on a regular basis, it's ok, but you should be trained from the start. But other than that, you're fine.<n><n>I love dogs. Just today I did a doggy group exercise. I got a really good workout, it was well run and the dogs were well behaved. Even though I don't own a dog I think it is beneficial for people to go outside and exercise with their dogs. Good luck, doggie group exercise may make the world a better place.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90. If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Output: 55<n><n>Input:What are ai machines known for doing?

Since the answer to this question tells us that the number of Dobermans is 20, there are 42 Dobermans plus 10 Schnauzers in one Doberman puppy plus ten Schnauzers in all the ones we have answered so far. Since the numbers are so close, it is reasonable to say that there are 42 Doberman puppies. However, if the number of Dobermann puppies is 5, then there is one puppy missing for every one (0.05) Schnauzer in the group. Since we know how many Schnauzers there are in the puppy mix, we know there are 42 Schnauzers in the group, which means that there are 42 Domenl puppies. The problem is, we cannot find the breed or manufacturer of the missing puppy. This is a question we always run into when playing logic boards.<n><n>To use this in your classroom you might try to compare the number of answers in the math problems to the number of puppies in the puppy mix to figure out how many puppies are missing. You have to do this by multiplying all the puppies in the puppy mix by 0.9 to get the number of puppies missing in the class. It's as simple as that! If you can't figure out how many puppies there are, you have to assume that the puppy mix is not complete. Then, using the formula from above, you might have to multiply the number of available puppies by 0.48, the number

When my step father found this dog at a shelter, I was delighted. My sister and I played fetch with her for hours. He was a really nice dog, and I loved him dearly. We even went on hunting vacations with this dog! But as life moved along, I grew to resent his "lack of effort", thinking that the dogs were "cheating" by running away when they could easily run up the long, straight, grass. As an adult I've started to understand that it's more than that. It's very much "meant to be" and "nature designed." This dog was a real part of my life. My life was enriched by his life. He was my guide. He was my best friend. When our dog-sitter couldn't find him, I searched for days. I'm a big dog person. I've always loved dogs and I could have cared less about the number if they really were "cheating" their human counterparts. At one point I actually called the police, "Why can't you find these two dogs?" My poor husband said, "You want me to tell you that they are not lost?" This poor little joke about nature was met with horror and despair from me. But I was so disappointed!<n><n>(There were a number of other responses from people who have been "cheated" by certain dogs - we'll include all of them here)<n><n>The word is BORNE<n>Which means to climb, over run or over walk, or: climb in a fast way, over a high obstacle, over a hard surface, to a great height;<n>To over stand, to stand up very high.<n><n>This game is based on this question: If the number of animals is equal to the number of objects in the game, how much time, or how many actions, can you complete in this time frame?<n>If the number of animals is less than the number of objects in game, how much time can you complete this time frame?<n><n>What you'll need<n><n>Door mat<n><n>Large box<n><n>Cord<n><n>Directions<n><n>1.

He felt a chill in the air and saw something at the end of the bed. A few minutes later, he had a nightmare where he saw his dead girlfriend with the knife in her mouth. The next morning he felt sick to his stomach. He ran to the doctor and admitted him to the hospital.<n><n>The doctor asked the young man if anything happened. He didn't, because he wasn't in his bed. He started to have a heart attack. The doctors had to resuscitate him because he was having a massive heart attack he couldn't breathe. After the heart attack the doctors ordered a CT scan of his chest to find out the condition of his heart. They told him he should probably go have the CT scan within 48 hours because of his heart problem.<n><n>The man went back to the hospital to have the CT scan. The doctor started asking him questions about his relationship with his girlfriend and what had happened at the end of the night.

The doctor said the patient was unstable and you won’t be able to tell anything from the CT scan.<n><n>While the man was being examined the doctor had him write in his notes that the man had a friend his age who was the same height as him.

We will kill the Doberman puppy if this puppy ever kills a Schnauzer.<n>4: An orange point on a Dober-dog indicates that the puppy will have puppies only the first time it crosses its white coat over the black coat of the other dog.

They are well-known for how they are sociable and well-behaved. A Schnauzer is a great dog for a family. Even though they are quite playful, they are smart and have great sense of hearing. They are good companions for you along with being great family dog. They are known for being a highly intelligent dog and they can distinguish a cat from a child through their nose.<n><n>One common theme that I have had with people coming into Schnauzers forums is that they have no idea what to do with a Schnauzer. In my opinion, the best training is just a combination of hands on and pet based teaching. The more you work with your dog, the faster you will learn some of commands for the dog (you could even try to get your dog to say the commands using the words). Then, have a play session with your dog every day for at least 30 minutes. For me, the play sessions consist of a game of fetch with a toy or a game of tug of war using an object to see who does better! Dogs love to see the other dog react while getting to see you do the command or play. I really consider this as play time with your dog, so take some time to focus on those activities. Also, take your dog on a longer walk every once in a while. I like to walk my dog in order to get his exercise, which is also good for his back.<n><n>Also, be very careful about any weight training you are about to do to your Schnauzers. I hear that it can be done safely but the weight can be really bad for them and I don't want you to become over weight because of it.<n><n>Schnauzer Forums<n><n>I started the Schnauzer Forums mainly to ask people who have dogs to post some advice so I could try and give some guidance on training my Schnauzer. I also try to post informative stuff so people who want to raise a good dog could learn some helpful tips, tricks or just some fun facts about the breed. I started up with a few posts.<n><n>A Schnauzer is a medium sized dog with a long nose and well mannered personality. As far as size, they are about the same size as a small English Labrador.

I cannot really think of where these two would not be on the same level. When I say the breed is hard to train, they probably are being unfairly criticized. If people really are that hard on dogs, then there would be no reason for them to own them.<n><n>B): This is a real problem. They have not really changed all that much over the years. They do have their special quirks and are a bit like cats in this sense, but they are really smart and fun to meet. I would not necessarily say they are as hard to train as an Australian cattle dog. They're the most obedient canine I have ever encountered and I would recommend that if you get one for your family, you become a vet. They will have the best temperament for all manner of things, except people. They would not be for everyone. A good owner will keep up their pet's routine and spend at least an hour a day with the dog so that it thinks of them as a person. They have a very different way of thinking and behaving from the rest of the general public. When you own a doberman, it is up to what you think of them and how you treat them.<n><n>C): I am an educator and we can't afford the temperament and behavior that these two require for us to continue to teach.

Which is the fastest dog?<n>Output:  "B"<n><n>Answer:<n>There are two things to consider when learning how to solve a Sudoku puzzle. First, you must select the correct squares, then you need to find a solution by subtracting the squares you chose. For example, when the squares are A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, the puzzle says you must subtract A1, B1 and B2.<n><n>The correct answer to the question is 8. The correct answer to this puzzle is 2.<n><n>We ask this question because the correct answers to each puzzle is 2. This can be seen by looking back at the last six puzzles. If you look back at the last six puzzle Solved, you can see that the correct answer to the first puzzle is 2. This tells you that it is impossible for each of the above eight puzzles to be solved by only two answers.<n><n>However, there is only one way to figure out the answer to the second, fourth, sixth and ninth puzzles. Let us think back a little and figure out the rules.<n><n>The first rule is that two numbers must always be even. There are two ways that two numbers can be even: 1) all of the numbers that are adjacent to each other must be even, or 2) the smallest one, plus one, must be equal to the largest one.<n><n>Let us look at the rules of our exercise, and this will be easy now. Each of the nine puzzles are 3 by 3 columns. The first three columns contain only the number one. Therefore, the second three columns contain only two numbers: 1 and 2.<n><n>This is easy enough in the first three columns. However, in the last three columns, two numbers are even and two are odd. In these last three columns it is impossible for numbers 1 and 2 to be equal to 3. Therefore, the second rule only applies to one of these three columns.<n><n>As soon as you can solve all six of these puzzles, move on to the next column. The first three columns are: 1, 2, and 3. In the last three columns, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 are just numbers, and thus they are even. Therefore, these columns are not even.<n><n>Now that the above six puzzles are solved, move

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n>Output:		 52 (all letters)<n><n>Solution:<n><n>Output: D (two letters).<n><n>You are being yelled at because you took one of your puppies and brought it home without telling your mom. When she discovered it she became really angry, and yelled to make sure you understood that you weren't allowed to take the puppy.<n><n>The number of Dobermans in the world is 20. Therefore the number of Schnauzer will be the same, because they share the same genetic material. Therefore you must have a Schnauzer and an Doberman in order to equal 90. Therefore, the number of Schnauzos will be 0. Therefore, the number Dobermans will be 5. Therefore the number of Dobermans puppies will be 20. Therefore, the number 20 must be smaller than the number 35. Therefore, the number 35 must be higher than the number 4. Therefore, the number 4 must be smaller than the numbers 9 & 8. Therefore, the number 8 must be smaller than the letters of the alphabet. Therefore, the number 9 must be higher than the numbers 1, 7, & 0. Therefore, the answer is 5. Therefore, the answer to your question (A) is correct. The correct answer is E.<n><n>Logical, not deductive, reasoning here<n><n>(A) There are 20 Doberman puppies, but the total number of puppies must be less than the number of Schnauzers is greater than 60.

When I thought about naming my first horse I thought of that horse. I wanted a name that would be able to do so many things. But my mom was very adamant, that she wasn't going to let me name a horse. So I decided to name her Ruby, and I was like, "Oh you should've had a boy name, Ruby's going to hate it and you won't be able to ride it." So she was going to name him, and I thought, "What if it was a girl?" Then I thought about making her a boy because it would be easier.<n>Then, that name, although it was a girl, came along, and I thought it would be nice because it was so simple. But I didn't really understand it. I thought it just meant... it was like... I didn't have a clue.<n><n>Well I just recently found out that my wife gave birth to a baby girl. I was a little upset about it at first, but as I get to know her I start to get more and more into my duties with her. As usual with all my families we started out being great friends in college. When I started dating my fiance, I figured we would start dating but in order for us to do that, she knew I had to have a job first. I know a lot of young guys think that they need their SO to pay for everything, but this doesn't work, my current girlfriend takes pride in paying for everything that we do together, so she takes on the baby, she cooks a lot and cleans some. Her mother is a nurse also, and she was very much into the military so she wants my daughter to have that sort of thing in life. We also have our own business, and a good friend of my fiancée works a little bit at the local elementary school and they have a lot of kids that come through the school that are very difficult for us to handle. So we are having our issues there. However, I got through my job search well enough that I could put up with being unemployed for a few weeks. About month and a half ago I decided I was going to go back to school. It would have been nice to keep working, but at least I had a choice.

She is feeling a bit melancholy that she was to be there and that her husband couldn't keep the promised promise because he and his job were having trouble. Thinking of all the little things she had planned to do in the five weeks she was in Bangkok. One important thing that she always made a point to do is a little shopping spree to celebrate her 40th birthday every year-a trip to Bangkok. Over the years, many of her friends have become married and one by one the trips have become more elaborate as well. On the other hand, her husband has always been very particular about where and with whom she should go. She was always careful to do everything right in any trip she undertook and, knowing that her husband has his faults, she went anyway. She had to buy a new purse because her wife's had been stolen. A new handbag with little pockets to carry her small stuff. A new bag that could also be used to carry all the clothes that her husband had bought for her. One last thing. She was sure that her husband would ask that she pay for the plane tickets for his trip at some time. She always said no. Then she saw a very expensive looking necklace on the dresser in her husband's flat and wanted to get it. He would only allow that one day at least when he was not working. This was her last year to get her wish and it would be her birthday on Dec 28 and her husband worked that day, just as it had been every year they had been married. So she decided that, when she had enough money, she would make the trip. She would pack all her old clothes and accessories. She had bought something like that in Bangkok once many years ago-it had felt very nice. She didn't expect the trip to be so long this time around. The problem now was how she was going to pay for her trip. She had a small part-time job as a maid in her husband's flat. That way she could pay for her entire trip. It was still a little sad since she knew it would be for no purpose. Her friends had bought clothes in Bangkok and she wanted to have just her basic clothes for the trip. Her husband would take them away from her when he came up to the flat. She felt sorry for herself. She knew that the trip would be

She turns her head, looking just as long, and then continues on her way. She walks past the man and goes back to her home, which is across the street from where she left the man last. She tells her children that she has seen him, and then asks them what they'd do if she showed up there again. They reply that they'd call the police. The woman is a bit confused, and asks, "But what if I'm pregnant?" The children reassure her that they wouldn't do anything to her at that point, but it's hard to feel comfort when you can't even look at the man you're supposed to be married to. The woman's husband asks about the missing man, and she admits that, maybe, there was a misunderstanding between them. That the man has left her, and will never return, and so he's not really her problem. The man doesn't speak, but he says that he has something to tell her. She turns around, and he walks across the street. They've never actually seen each other, but there was a bit of a misunderstanding, and if she calls the police again, the authorities will have to search all the houses on the block as well, to make sure that there are no other men out there that might be after her. So when the husband asks about the missing person, the wife tells him that she'll have to call the police. The man replies, "Who am I?" The police find the man, and ask if he would like to talk to anyone. The man says that he has no idea who the woman is, and that he doesn't remember seeing her before the last time he'd seen her. The police ask if there are any other missing people. The man says that that's the longest he's been gone from home for in almost 20 years. The officer questions the man about his employment, and he replies that he's not happy about working for a government agency, but that he has to do the job. The officer explains that a government job doesn't pay enough to keep a family on their feet, and then asks if the man would like a change. The man replies that he'd prefer to be unemployed, since he doesn't believe

I do not think anyone will take the time to read these.<n><n>Good morning<n>I don't think I followed the instructions perfectly. I just answered the question. My question was is a doberman a doberman? If so, it should be under 35 pounds, if not, it probably should be. That's the answer to question 2 which is not a question btw.<n>This is what it says for the final two. This is what it says for question 3: "Do dogs require a family of their own?" The first word should be removed entirely.<n><n>What makes you more qualified than everyone else to teach dogs how to talk?<n>What would you do with the money you would make from teaching dogs?<n><n>Good Morning.<n>I think you are supposed to tell us how you feel.

However, there is a German Sheporthund, a Pomeranian, and a Golden Retriever. I don't know a lot about the breed other that they are a lot smaller than a Doberman. I suppose I don't know enough about what makes a dog a dog to know that they have the same kind of heart.<n>I personally feel that any dog that can communicate can learn to speak. I was talking about the doberman from your description. I don't think this would be an unreasonable question from a kindergarten or primary class if there is good cause. My guess is there is no good reason or real need for a dog to be taught to speak. If you want to teach young dogs, I guess they would be better off if you would only be teaching them a few words, though I hope not more as your students will end up learning the other words as well.<n>Just my two cents.<n><n>Well I had two doberman puppies and they have been training them since early childhood. The only thing they did during puppyhood was play and they have still been playing ever since. I don't see the issue. If they want to learn to talk then they will probably learn words. I have always seen parents training their kids to do a lot more than learn to talk.<n>I'm not too sure about what type of person would take this though. Do they want to go up

At first glance the problem with many people is quite simple. They think that they got a headache, but they have a very bad ear infection. To fix the problem they need to see a specialist and get a prescription for something they can use on their ear.<n><n>Solution:<n>A doctor who wants to see you must write a letter to a government office that has something to do with healthcare (I think its called the Food and Drug Administration). First the doctor asks to see your prescription. Then he or she gets copies of the prescriptions written by other doctors and you have to sign the signed prescriptions. And since you have signed one of the prescriptions, the doctor may be obligated to get the rest of the prescription drugs for the rest of the day. If you aren't in America, then the doctor may have to come to your home, fill the prescriptions, give you the pills and wait for you to go to a lab to draw a blood sample. And then you still have to sign

A huge problem that will cause great suffering at great cost to humanity. If we do not act immediately we will be on the brink of causing our own extinction. We could try to slow down the pollution and reduce some of our overusage, but many of our products are destroying our planet. We would have to change the way we see the world and try to live within our means and resources. We know this won’t be possible, but it is possible to slow down the problem, to adapt to the changing environment, and it is possible even to eliminate our need for petroleum. We can’t do it all at once, so we will gradually have to come to terms with our current situation. When we do, we will find ourselves in a much better position to deal with the rest of our issues. What can we do now?<n><n>I believe it can be done.<n><n>How to help:<n><n>The best solution is to make a serious effort to reduce your use. Even if you cannot do that you should make reasonable efforts to reduce your impact. The easiest and most inexpensive steps are as follows:<n><n>1)Buy products that can be used outside for the most part.<n><n>2)Use public transportation instead of driving to the grocery store.<n><n>3)If you have already moved to a cleaner area, move to another one.<n><n>4)Choose products that can be reused.<n><n>5)Buy products that are recyclable or compostable.<n><n>6)Reduce your energy consumption

Not only can they be seen by humans, but some tracks that look like they are from dinosaurs are actually from different plants. They are found under fallen rocks and near streams, rivers and seas.

The track is called the Quino Trail (in Spanish). Dinosaur Tracks are like dinosaur footprints, but they are larger. Their prints are round, but not as pointy and hard as the dinosaur's. These tracks are perfect for walking, as they are not too flat or too uneven. They are easy to find and are in rocks and gravel beds like dinosaur tracks. Dinosaur Tracks may also be found in tree cavities or under fallen trees." (e) In your own words provide the following: (a) Example of dinosaur tracks by a dinosaur in your book.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90. If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Output: 55<n><n>Input:Where is a horse likely to live? Choices:  A: michigan B: stable C: race track D: farm yard E: arizona<n>Output:		 4<n><n>Answer: A is probably correct on this one. A lot of Doberman breeders breed for the Doberman's ability to hunt foxes, bobcats, and other big game animals using scent as their method of tracking. As a fox is large and can move fast, dogs usually have to chase after it. Once you have your Doberman's scent, they are quite confident and will chase it down rather quickly, and most Dobermann breeders use this method.<n><n>You should also not breed Dobermans for their intelligence like some people do. Although Dobermans are intelligent dogs, they are not considered well socialized. This puts them at a slight advantage over the less well socialized dogs of the other two dog breeds.<n><n>Dobey<n><n>05-17-2014 03:46 PM<n><n>You should make the correct answers for all the multiple choice questions in this thread.

Choices:  A: talk B: read book C: play piano D: study book E: study engineering<n>Output:		 A<n><n>Please tell a few sentences or phrases that you most associated with this question: [A] "Play the piano" - I think that I have heard of this one before<n><n>If someone were to write something similar to this essay about themselves, here is a selection they may want to use:<n><n>I love books and I enjoy reading books in bed. I have always wanted to play the piano however my parents would probably put a stop to that sooner rather than later. I would never let them know however.<n><n>My friends in class that I don't really care about really annoy me. They make jokes, don't take notes and really are just not that good at school.<n><n>I have a friend that I really like, he is fun to hang out with, but he does make some questionable choices that most people would never choose to do. He has a thing for my brother as well, and even though I'm pretty much his best friend, I have to let it go in the end.<n><n>I like to read, I hate school, however I have never struggled in it. I love music, I sing in every class, and my favorite place to read is the library.<n><n>In addition, this essay should have focused more intently on an action that was demonstrated versus something that was stated.<n><n>How did you decide on this theme and the format? If you had to do it again, how would you do it differently?<n><n>Overall, I think this question is very well written and fairly easy to answer. However, I think that the word choice is what made the question appear more difficult and gave students the illusion that they could possibly miss an answer by that much. If you give students multiple choice on how to answer the questions, you need to give clear indication on where to answer each question, otherwise it just gives the impression that the students could answer the questions in a different way.<n><n>Why would you write this essay?

In most cases, you want students to provide as much help as possible for your essay questions. However, when multiple choice asks for help, the

Answer: There are four combinations to get a new item based on the game: 5, 10, 25 and 50.<n><n>The number of people the two dogs will interact with depends on the number of days they are separated. The chance is very low. One dog may interact with both humans and the other dog.<n><n>There are four possible actions on the card. As there are more rows and columns, the chance of an outcome increases. For example. The first three rows contain the four possible actions. The third row contains only the third row, meaning the first row counts the same as the second row; and the last row counts the same as all other rows.<n><n>A dog that lives in a town of 100 is more likely to interact with four people at the beginning of time than four people at the end of time. But the chances are still low. This is even the case for the fifth person to meet this dog. The chances of the first and the second meeting decreases but remains the same with the fifth person as with the first, the second, the third, and the fourth people.<n><n>A dog can have a high chance of interacting with people. It will interact with only one person per two days, or a human and a dog, and with two humans and two dogs, if there aren't too many days in a row.

I have tried searching the internet and cannot find answers. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks<n><n>A: Doberman puppy<n>A: Schnauzer puppy<n>A: Schnocker or Spitz puppy<n>A: Lab or Dooder puppy<n><n>Answer: A Schnauzer puppy is a light-colored German Shepherd of 5-7 lbs. With brown eyes, a large coat and white patches. A Doberman (German Shepherd) puppy is a medium sized dog of 6-9 lbs.<n><n>In the United States, Doberman's puppies (or Dobermani's) and Schnauzer puppies (or Dobermans) are sometimes referred to as "lab puppies". Both A Doberman and a Schnauczer are German shepherd breeds, but a Schnauzer tends to have a stronger coat than a Doberman.<n><n>Also, A Schnauzer puppy tends to have smaller paws than a Doberman puppy.<n><n>Although the breeds are closely related, they have very different physical attributes and play styles. Doberman's play more aggressively than a Schnauzer. Both are powerful off-the-cuff fighters, but a Doberman tends to have a more robust play style.

They love hunting and killing animals. When they find a mouse, they take it to the bathroom and clean it out. Do you believe that cats can use their teeth to kill a mouse? (Cats) or (Dogs)?<n>Output:   ____ cats like to go on walks and hunt and kill _____ creatures<n><n>Boring.... What's the secret? What does he/she do that makes the cats want to go out?  I don't know, I hate that question.<n><n>(This is a test question) [Answers: D, B] What can be done to help solve this problem?<n><n>(This is another test question) [Ans: E, B] What are the animals that cats avoid?<n><n>It's pretty obvious, cats are not wild animals. They are not predators. They are prey animals. They are animals like dogs, dogs are prey animals. If you feed and train a dog to not be a prey animal, guess what? You make a predator out of that dog. They are all different. Dogs are all pretty much the same, wolves are different. Cats are different. They can run faster than dogs, and that's about it. Cats prefer to have nothing to do with dogs. If I were to say, 'What cats like?', I would be telling the cat, 'You like sitting, you like to eat. What else do you like?' Cats need to have enough space to run around and hunt and kill things. You cannot train a cat to keep its teeth clean. If you took a cat, say, a German Shepherd with those teeth, and you gave it some brushy things that did not harm, the first thing it would do is go into food aggression mode, which causes it to destroy your garden, kill, and destroy the lives of people and animals. Cats want to play, they want to hunt. They want to eat, but they don't want to kill. They can eat anything. If you train them to do things one way, you are turning them into something they don't want to be. Dogs and cats both eat, but cats prefer to use their mouth more as a predator mouth, not for eating. Dogs like to eat people, cats only eat plants. I don't know, it's pretty obvious. But cats are not wild animals, they are

He thought it was a dollar because it had a $ on the head. After a little while he noticed that it had an "S" on the rim. He then began wondering what the S represented.<n>As he learned more about how the coins were created he came to the conclusion that the dollar didn't have the "S" because it was made of silver. As a result, on his silver dollar coin there were more words than just a dollar, and some were left out. His coin had so many words in it that it was in no way fit for circulation.<n>After a little while the boy realized that he could split the coin three ways. He chose the number 7 as a place holder. He didn't care what he got so long as it wouldn't be a dollar. So he split the remaining 7 coins 3 ways, giving him the following money:<n>7 $10 $5<n>Each half ounce of silver silver had 1 $7 on the coin. The $5 was divided 3 ways. The $10 coin, being 2 ounces, was split 3 ways. The $5 still had 1 dollar for a total of 5. On the 7 coin was written the "S" from a dollar coin, which was left off.<n>The difference between the silver dollars that he had split had an equal amount of silver. The dollar coin that he had split 4 ways had a smaller amount of silver.<n>The difference amount of silver between the coins that the boy split by 3 ways still had the same amount of silver. He had enough silver to divide equally.<n><n>In a business school business simulation, class decided to develop a service that could serve as a replacement for the ATM in a bank.

When I woke up the next morning the pain was so bad that I had to ask my Doberman to help me to the toilet because the pain wasn't bearable. I've got a lot of work on the stairs before that happens again. I need to work out, strengthen my legs more and to get a cane instead of using a rope. Do you think the Doberman can help me with this? How should I work to get better at climbing up these stairs? Would a small dog like Doberman really be helping me with this task? What would your advice be?<n><n>Hi Linda,<n><n>If you're comfortable with the dog, I think that you can have a good time up the stairs with him/her, and that you can find the right dog size from the dog shop for your personal needs. However, if you're not comfortable taking your dog up the stairs, a small dog would be better... or you could train the dog yourself to be a little more gentle. I'd like you to tell us more about it, to see how you can change the situation to your liking.<n><n>A: If you ask him, he will have his own plans and do his own thing but we all know that he listens to us a lot.

Choices:  A: school B: office building C: house D: hotel E: centre<n>Output:		 B<n><n>Input:When I was growing up my dad let me have a puppy with each birthday my mother got me. On the fifteenth of August 1997 my father gave me a dog. When I turned thirteen I asked my mother if I could have a dog when I turned fourteen, she agreed so I brought home a mutt named Sushi. When I turned sixteen, my father got to work and set up a puppy mill in our kitchen. My entire family has witnessed the abuse that Sushi has suffered in the last ten years that have led our family to move to my father's house in Mexico. When Sushi was thirteen, she had puppies and they named her Lili. I named Sushi after my older sister. She took one look at the puppies and ran away when my father was gone. My father bought a small house next to the mill and took in the dogs. Two years after the mill went out of business, my father got a divorce and moved my sister and I to Florida. My mother works very hard to take care of us all. When the mill closed I went to live with my father near the mill. Every morning I wake up and my father starts feeding me. One day he told me that he didn't want to feed me so I came running in with the puppy I got after the mill closed. My father wanted to get rid of him, so he hit him real hard on the head. The puppy died and he blamed it on me. I am currently studying animal sciences at a college down south. I have two pups and a little dog with me. When my younger sister was fourteen she had puppies and she named them Daisy and Lily. When I was fourteen I asked my mother if she could let me have a mutt named Sush. When my mother agreed, I set a trap for her dog and released it. When I saw Sush run from me I ran after him and scared him back into the house. When I got home my mother found him and I was able to take him to the shelter where they cared for him until he died from his injuries. After Sush died my father put my sister and I in a room next doors to the mill and they live with my brother and his wife. My father says that they like the mill because they can live there until they can find a place to live on their own. I want to help my family get some kind of place to live. Is there anything I could do to help without my family having to use the services

The man in the street is always trying to answer that question, but he can't because we all failed in life.<n>-M.E. Miller<n><n>The Doberman has a reputation as being extremely loyal, and that is due to their intelligence and devotion. They have a very intelligent dog and are extremely loyal. They are a very intelligent dog and do not like to be in a situation where they feel they can’t trust someone or do something for themselves. They are very loyal dogs and as long as you get them when they are able, they seem to be happy to spend time with you. Although they can bite, they tend not to with dogs their own age or older. If you get them too young, they will bite until you have to force them to stop or put them somewhere.<n><n>Doberman puppy’s are very smart and know instinctively what they have to do. A well trained and social Doberman will do fine in an older environment, but it may be hard to socialize a Doberman since they are so independent. Most people give Doberman puppies their first few years with lots of playtime, but the same thing can easily go wrong. If you force them to listen to you, they may start to associate their owner with commands instead of the person they should be acting on. Remember when the puppies are puppies it is best to give them time but by the age of one you have to start paying attention to them and teaching them the commands. A good rule of thumb is “Never give a puppy to a child”. Some puppies can be good around children if you have a good connection but with some of these breeds they can get territorial and might not want to go to a child’s bedroom if you don’t live in the house. You really need a dog park and a dog-sitter that knows what they are doing.<n><n>I hope this helps and good luck with your new puppies you have created!

Choices:  A: nuclear power plant B: center C: basement D: main office E: bowel of the ship<n>Output:		 C<n><n>I think a master control in the basement is a bit of a stretch. Probably another one of those cases where the author thinks things look cooler from this perspective and it isn't really correct because they'd already be inside. It's like saying there is a master control for the TARDIS' gravity waves.<n><n>When I was younger I read that an episode of Doctor Who featured a timey-wimey device similar to what the Tardis has, and it took place in the basement of a London office building (they even had to create a fictional office block to show the space between the floors). It's been a long time, my memory is a bit hazy on this.<n><n>There is a Tardis time machine episode from the UK broadcast in the 70's. It appears to be in a basement. There is also a short story I think from the U.S. broadcast that takes place at a computer company in a basement.<n><n>A computer company? That sounds like a place that should be underground but has somehow survived up above... That doesn't make much sense given their current state of business and how much money they make.<n><n>The BBC has the resources to build the Tardis for a little less than it would cost to build a real one, so why not do it in the basement?<n><n>The space between floors and corridors also makes for an interesting story.<n><n>Here's a question for the readers. What sort of structure is a basement?<n><n>I don't think you could construct a proper structure like a basement based on just a word without some sort of justification. I mean, as far as I know, basements aren't really built anymore.<n><n>A basements is more or less a room in a house that is used as storage and/or shelter.

I had a relationship with someone new where I learned that you are never alone; you become better as a couple by accepting who you are. This happened because I was so scared of the unknown that I didn’t know myself.<n><n>Secondly, I had a relationship with a new guy that taught how to be in a relationship, instead of being in a relationship from the onset.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90. If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Output: 55<n><n>Input:What is not a safe way to transport jewelry on vacation? Choices:  A: suitcase B: department store C: safe deposit box D: these twos are not safe way to transport jewellery E: lady's boudoir<n>Output:		 B<n><n>The student will need to read the entire text while reading all the highlighted parts.<n><n>*** Answers ***<n><n>1. Because in the story the children do not know where the puppy's birth was, the number of puppies are not really important. What the difference between the number is a matter of preference. If the number of puppies is 20, how to answer the question: " How many Schnauzer puppies are there?"<n><n>2. The word "safe" does not mean that the package is covered with some kind of security barrier at the airport. In fact, it means that the package is insured. This statement also does not really mean that the safe container is safer than other containers from which it arrives at the airport. If all of the cargo was examined, you would find that the safe container is in fact as safe as any other container. There could be some items in the package that are beyond the control of the airport personnel. But the security screening itself does not make the container unsafe. There will be other containers used at each place where a package arrives that are handled by the security personnel, as well as other packages that will be handled by humans themselves. The package that arrives at the airport can be examined at different places.<n><n>3. Doberman puppies are not the only kind of puppies that are born on a regular basis. There is also a Schnauzer called the "Ginger Puppy". Since the Ginger Puppy has only one eye, some have said that if the Ginger Puppie had been born blind or had a deaf-mute nose (which most people think the Ginger Puppy to be) then it could be seen as a "safety" problem. The fact that it had one eye or the other (or that it was blind or deaf-mute) was not a problem because the package arrived in a safe and insured package.<n><n>4. When you travel with someone else, then it might be a good idea to put an ear tag with your name on it to help them get through security quicker. Since a person cannot be sure that the person they are with is not taking any illicit drugs or weapons or is an illegal drug dealer, the only way to be sure is to get a name tag so you can keep eye contact with him or her. But a name tag with your own name on it might not be the best way to go, since it might be a good way to put the other person off by not acting polite. In such a situation

The doctors removed her kidneys and reassembled them. One of the kidneys belonged to an old man, and the other one was donated by a young girl. The young girl was very proud of her kidney donation. To make a lasting impression, she dressed up as her donor and walked around the hospital asking people for donations of new kidneys. She would be thrilled to know that her donation had helped two people. A few days went by and the doctor heard from another young girl who had been inspired by her donor. She was sure that her transplant helped three people. When the doctor called the student to let her know that her kidney had helped 4 people she was shocked, but delighted. The young woman called the doctor a few days later and announced how much she loved his phone call and how her kidney had helped her uncle, mom, the family, and even another old man. She thanked him for his call and she told him how her kidney had helped 6 people, including the man he had donated to. The young woman's friend also called the doctor and found out that her uncle also needed a kidney. He became very depressed when he heard that 4 of his other nephews needed kidneys. To make a lasting impact on the lives of these 6 young men and 2 women, the doctor arranged for them to have separate transplants from the old man and the young girl. After the transplant, the young girl decided to dress up again as her donor. She wanted to get as many people as possible to know about and raise money for her cause. Within a short time, the young girl reached out to other people in her community and called them up to ask some people in their communities for money about the cause of her kidney. She told them what the goal of the event was, to raise money for kidney transplants.<n><n>Input: Which of the five following is not the "I" in II?<n>Output: A, B, C, D, E<n><n>Input: The following are six "I" words, each with the same meaning.

They decided to drive to town for their evening meal, and as they did, they stopped by a gas station.  It was a regular station, not much different from any other gas station around.  They got out to go across the street to buy their gas and when they got back to their car they discovered that their door had been left unlocked.  They drove over to the front of the store and they noticed that someone had broken the window of their car.  One by one, they knocked on the window and spoke to the person.  When they got to the driver's side window, they could see that the car door was completely open.  The men decided to turn around and go back the way they had come to the gas station.  They drove the car home.<n>When they got home, they unlocked their home door and looked through the window to see if anyone had broken in.  They found the person who had broken their home door sitting on the front porch.  He had been smoking a cigarette, was drunk, and did not even have an ID.  He got up to leave and the men chased him down.  They began beating the man and when he lost consciousness, one of the men pulled off his coat and bound him up with duct tape.  They tied him up in the trunk of the car and drove him to a local hospital.  He woke up in the ICU wearing a gagged mask, tubes everywhere, tubes in his nose, and had cuts all over his body.  He had serious brain damage and was in a medically induced coma.<n>Two weeks later, doctors told his parents that he could not live without his breathing machine.  They gave him seven days to live.  The father, knowing that his son would die without a respirator, decided to get a portable breathing machine for his son.  He bought a portable device and walked into the hospital to have it plugged into his son's respirator.  As his son slept, and the new breathing device was plugged into the respirator, his father, with his portable breathing device, woke him up using the respirator.  He woke his son up over and over until his son started to come to life.  While he would not speak for three weeks, his breathing was stable.  They knew that his life support was turned off, and his parents let him die with a smile on his face knowing that their son had

Choices:  A: grocery store B: nightstand C: armpits D: own bathroom E: medicine chest<n>Output:		 45<n><n>The dog is trained to find specific objects by pulling on a string and by shaking a broomstick (see video at end of course).If the dog goes to the left of the broomstick a lot of times it will pull on the string, sometimes more.If it goes to the right of the broomstick a little, it will not. If the object changes its location, the dog must also change its location.How does this training method work?<n>Answer:<n>The dog does not need to change its location since it knows exactly where the target is located. Hence, he makes no effort to go to the wrong place. The dog only notices, and is therefore rewarded, for looking at the right place. In other words, it uses a simple spatial reasoning process to know where, and when, the right place is.<n><n>One technique to improve the effectiveness of training is to reward the dog with a treat when it is successful in finding what you want. Some people treat their dogs with soft foods like canned dog food or wet food and treat biscuits.<n>You should know that many dogs have a tendency to become discouraged and angry when working on specific tasks. Some dogs like the chase game, especially after a long day's work. A dog that wants to run really fast will not want to do any activity for which he is frustrated. But if this situation is addressed early, before your dog becomes angry, you can use this reaction to teach him patience while training. You should provide lots of good distractions so he is not frustrated by chasing the ball or tug ball. If he is annoyed by trying to play the chase game for too long, you can give him a playmate, such as a toy or a stuffed animal, and the object he is trying to retrieve, or make the game short and simple. So keep the focus short and simple, and he will eventually work out how to get the object he wants, even though it takes longer than expected. As he becomes more aware of the problem, you can gradually add more distractions, including your toy if appropriate, to the game, and he will become more interested in working with you.

Choices:  A: say thank B: smile C: looking for D: get more E: show appreciation<n>Output:		 37<n><n>Comments<n><n>It could be argued that Schnauzers being in the same group could be a plus - as the Schnauzer breed is small and only 2-3 years old, its easier to catch them and train them - and therefore easier to educate owners. I remember doing an informal poll with my parents when they adopted their first Schnauzer. They asked us to pick a Schnauzer "best friend", and we did. I think it was easy to pick out my Schnauzer, though (because she could bark so much!).<n><n>It is a mixed reaction. There are many that don't like the breed, but that's due to the media attention they get. A lot of them can be trained to be good companions and even get along fine with other breeds...but they're more likely to want to fight other dogs that try to bite them or take over when they're playing.<n><n>In all my years with the breed, I've met perhaps one or two of the mean ones...and they were pretty much always under 5 or 6 years old and pretty much in the care of adults, not kids. The most I ever saw was a couple that were the same age and the dogs were under a year in age and they were really small and kind of aggressive to one another...no bites or anything.<n><n>It could be said that all pure breeds are a good mix of various types so you're probably getting a good blend in your Schnauzer as your parents seemed to have a good mix in their dog. You'll see better dog behavior in the younger puppy (who may already have some of the personality traits of you and your parents) but it wouldn't hurt to wait until the older one to get started learning the basics so you can be on the same page as it's the same age.<n><n>There shouldn't be any problems with aggression or fighting. I don't think there are any big differences between different breed dog types. It's just about the person and their temperament.<n><n>I don't think you actually need a dog of one type. I think having a dog of multiple types is essential for proper training. I've had dogs that were all different breeds. My one dog is a Schnauzer, my oldest daughter has a Doberman and a Schnauzer, and my next youngest has a Schnauzer and a Schnauzer. All five of my dogs are completely different from each other. As long as you don't have to fight all the time

They fill the boxes one-third at a time and let the food and water run through their spouts. If they fill another box to the same degree, they will have exactly the same water and food.

For example, 3 days would be pretty good for some problems and horrible for others. That way the problem can be updated more frequently as people have comments.<n><n>Also, for me at least, it makes no sense to have a very long problem and then give people an arbitrary number of steps as well so long as you offer some advice on which of the various options are most realistic. What I would do is offer a few possible choices and work them down, starting with a few where one of the more realistic options is chosen and slowly working down from there. That way, people don't get a very long problem and are only given solutions in parts.<n><n>Finally, I would just give some initial suggestions and hope that people come in on Monday and we can get this figured out. This way, people can jump in wherever they are on Monday's.<n><n>As part of the discussion, people can also have their own ideas about where the problem should be placed for each day of the week. I haven't thought through everything since I'm not going to be here on Monday, but I know that I have some ideas about where this problem could be for Sunday afternoon and why it should stay there versus where it should be Monday. So, someone could give me suggestions for that day and I can make my own decisions. Or someone could suggest an option, especially if they are more realistic and would give a useful suggestion.<n><n>__________________<n>1. The more things change the more they remain the same.2.

Then Monday morning should see that this isn't a problem that can be solved in a few days and I think Monday could be a better day to suggest a solution than Sunday. That being said, I do also realize that most people are more concerned with how quickly a problem should go than the actual number of steps involved. This is where the next couple options come in.<n><n>1. After the first few days the

I think you have just taken "X" to mean "Dogs will die when you don't feed them" and now you need to get to step D: talking, stealing, dying.<n><n>This was a wonderful introduction to the issue of how to make a correct answer of this sort.  I've seen this issue presented as a problem before, although in the other case the answer was actually "The number of Doberman Puppies = (number of Schnauzers) X 45" but you had to remember that it could also be written in fractions.  You could just get the fraction from the equation right away.  I guess it could be thought of as a "fraction of X" problem, with the only difference being that the "X" is the number of dogs.  But you do need to use that number as part of the solution (as opposed to just "X" being "45"), and the answer has to be correct.  But like other problems in this thread you can't just give out incorrect answers since people will get angry.<n><n>My suggestion to your teacher has already been put up, so do your reading.  It's a very straightforward problem.

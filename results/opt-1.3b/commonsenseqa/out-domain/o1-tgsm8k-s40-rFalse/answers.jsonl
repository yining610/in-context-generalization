Chooses:\n\nThis was the first exercise in the course and is given at the end of each class. There are no problems and it is up to the student to identify the answer from the clues. After all, the answer to the exercise provides the question they were asked to solve. I don\u2019t care what you think of the exercise, it works. Allowing the student to be the detective allows them to focus on the problem and get some help from me as they answer. There are a number of points in this exercise that I think are valuable for you to consider as you consider choosing an animal companion.\n\nHow To Answer Questions Correctly with the Answer Key\n\nFor the last few class assignments, the students each have a \u201ckey\u201d that allows them to identify what is being asked. I have found that this is an effective way of solving problems. I have found that the key has a lot to do with the answers. I also know there are students who find the key to be a distraction. However, when I give them both keys and ask them if it\u2019s all right if I mark them both it becomes a great lesson in learning to read. I also know there will be students using both keys which I believe makes the game a little easier.\n\nBy Marking Both Answers It Makes It Fun\n\nFor me to solve a problem, I usually like to have some fun with it. I don\u2019T need to be the most brilliant scientist to solve the problem. Sometimes the fun in solving problems is knowing that the solution is possible. The problem could be as simple as what do drugs do, but if I am able to think of an idea to solve the problem it makes it one that I can remember for the future. You know, life is one big problem and the solution to that problem often is more complex than you think. Sometimes the answer to the question is right in front of you, but it\u2019s not there.

The man in the car says, \"Look, I'll bet that cop is going to pull over now,\" and the driver says, \"No way, he'll think I blew a stop sign.\" As the cop car approaches the car it slows, and the man in the car shouts \"Look, I blew a stop sign and so did you!\" A police car appears, but the man in the passenger seat says, \"Sorry, the sign is in the way, I have to park in front.\" The car that they merged in with says, \"You were going so slow, I didn't think you had time to be so reckless.\" They are about to speak again when the officer says, \"Listen, if I hadn't had to block the other car in front of us, could I have caught up to you sooner?\"\n\nWhat does the driver conclude from this dialogue?

However, there are some exceptions. Doberman puppies tend to become aggressive when left alone for a long period of time and when stressed. This can be aggravated by loud noises or other loud circumstances.\nIf the dog is left alone for a long time, it can become extremely aggressive and could be vicious. Dobermans frequently become fearful of strangers. The fear can be because the dog has a history of being abandoned or abused. Therefore, it is important for the puppy to be shown as a puppy. Although aggressive dogs can be easily tamed, it is important for you to establish a good relationship with the dog to avoid the dog becoming aggressive. It will also help with the puppy\u2019s behavioral problems.\nAlthough there are certain specific times of day that Dobermen can become aggressive, they are usually more aggressive at night or late at night. Aggressive dogs are normally found in large pack settings. Therefore, it is possible to establish a group for the Doberman, but the pack might be a bit overwhelming if it is a large, independent pack where a high degree of individual control is needed.", "answer": "A: home"}

{"text": "1\n\nInput:What are some interesting facts about dogs? The first one is that dogs are like humans, very emotional animals, and this emotion comes out in their canine companions. For most Doberman puppies, their early experiences are often very positive and at the age of 1 to 3 months, the puppy can understand and communicate with humans and many others, but there will be challenges for the puppy to overcome to be more empathetic. Some of their challenges with socializing are being the only dog in the house to react badly when one of the owners cries, or when one of the owners gets upset at not hearing every detail about each day's activities. The puppy is also more likely to have ear infections at the age of one month than humans. When they grow up as puppies they can learn many things, such as the importance of their family, and the care and security of their owners, but they are still at a very young age to fully comprehend the meaning of their responsibilities. Their loyalty to their owners is demonstrated when they will run into their owners home to attack them, but will only bite if the dogs owner is not nearby. The puppy is extremely loyal.\n\nOutput:\n\"How many Doberman puppies are there?\"\n\"Where are their parents?\"\n\"Are they going to have puppies?\"\n\nOutput:\n\nOutput:\nBarking like a seal. Barking is their most important quality. If their ears are not cleaned at birth, they will spend a lifetime being a barker.\n\nOutput:Barking is their most important communication. If their ears are cleaned at birth, they learn to speak very quickly. If a Doberman puppy is not used to the sound of their own voice, then it will not understand what they are saying.

To understand this answer, think about the number of people working together for 5 less than 3 times the number of people for 4 less than 3 times the value of 5 plus the difference between the 2 and the 20. If this works then there are 52 people working along for 5 less than 40 times the value of 4 minus 20, and the number of people employed has to be 60.

{"text": "A - B - C\n\nInput:What type of dog is Doberman (Doberman Pinscher)? B: Mastiff C: Boxer\nOutput: A - C - D\n\nDoberman is the name most commonly given to the breed of dog that is an offshoot of the German Schnauzer. A well-formed short-haired Doberman is known as a dachshund; a short-haired dachshund is called a poodle; and all other breeds are called standard dachshunds or standard Schnauzers.\n\nOrigin of Doberman\n\nThe exact origin of the Doberman is uncertain. There are some theories, two of which are very similar: 1) that the breed's name comes from German dachshund (a dog that was used to dig holes); 2) that the breed's nickname derives from a German phrase dauerhaft ohne zum Schluss, which translates as long-suffering, and indicates that the dogs might have some kind of difficulty in getting used to the demands of work. Another common theory is that the breed was named by Adolf Hitler as an anti-German dog, to suggest a dog's loyalty to its mistress (i.e. Adolf Hitler). Hitler was said to have made the dogs' name Doberman and used it as a disparaging term for the German people. This theory was used by Adolf Hitler to suggest anti-Semitic tendencies in Germany.\n\nTheories\n\nThe origins of the Doberman are as varied as its dog breed. Some theories, such as the first, suggest that it came from a species of dog known under the name \"Schn\u00fcrzer\" which has the appearance of a miniature German shepherd combined with a long coat. Alternatively, the most common theory is that the Doberman came from the Dachshund, which was one of the many canine breeds created by the Germans during the 19th century to fight against Napoleon in the Franco-Prussian War. The first known Dachshund was invented by Johann Friedrich Pfefferkorn in 1825 in Bavaria. In 1831, the breed was adopted and named after Napoleon by General Otto von B\u00f6rner.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Dachshund was used primarily as an anti-French dog, due to its small size (compared to the French, which is what is believed to be its real inspiration), the fact that no French", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

Since the answer to this question tells us that the number of Dobermans is 20, there are 42 Dobermans plus 10 Schnauzers in one Doberman puppy plus ten Schnauzers in all the ones we have answered so far. Since the numbers are so close, it is reasonable to say that there are 42 Doberman puppies. However, if the number of Dobermann puppies is 5, then there is one puppy missing for every one (0.05) Schnauzer in the group. Since we know how many Schnauzers there are in the puppy mix, we know there are 42 Schnauzers in the group, which means that there are 42 Domenl puppies. The problem is, we cannot find the breed or manufacturer of the missing puppy. This is a question we always run into when playing logic boards.\n\nTo use this in your classroom you might try to compare the number of answers in the math problems to the number of puppies in the puppy mix to figure out how many puppies are missing. You have to do this by multiplying all the puppies in the puppy mix by 0.9 to get the number of puppies missing in the class. It's as simple as that! If you can't figure out how many puppies there are, you have to assume that the puppy mix is not complete.

He was a really nice dog, and I loved him dearly. We even went on hunting vacations with this dog! But as life moved along, I grew to resent his \"lack of effort\", thinking that the dogs were \"cheating\" by running away when they could easily run up the long, straight, grass. As an adult I've started to understand that it's more than that. It's very much \"meant to be\" and \"nature designed.\" This dog was a real part of my life. My life was enriched by his life. He was my guide. He was my best friend. When our dog-sitter couldn't find him, I searched for days. I'm a big dog person. I've always loved dogs and I could have cared less about the number if they really were \"cheating\" their human counterparts. At one point I actually called the police, \"Why can't you find these two dogs?\" My poor husband said, \"You want me to tell you that they are not lost?\" This poor little joke about nature was met with horror and despair from me. But I was so disappointed!\n\n(There were a number of other responses from people who have been \"cheated\" by certain dogs - we'll include all of them here)\n\nThe word is BORNE\nWhich means to climb, over run or over walk, or: climb in a fast way, over a high obstacle, over a hard surface, to a great height;\nTo over stand, to stand up very high.\n\nThis game is based on this question: If the number of animals is equal to the number of objects in the game, how much time, or how many actions, can you complete in this time frame?\nIf the number of animals is less than the number of objects in game, how much time can you complete this time frame?\n\nWhat you'll need\n\nDoor mat\n\nLarge box\n\nCord\n\nDirections\n\n1.

The dog that I saw is around 3.5 to 4 years old, and they are a lot bigger than they were when they were young. But in my experience, they can't change into puppy size easily.

He felt a chill in the air and saw something at the end of the bed. A few minutes later, he had a nightmare where he saw his dead girlfriend with the knife in her mouth. The next morning he felt sick to his stomach. He ran to the doctor and admitted him to the hospital.\n\nThe doctor asked the young man if anything happened. He didn't, because he wasn't in his bed. He started to have a heart attack. The doctors had to resuscitate him because he was having a massive heart attack he couldn't breathe. After the heart attack the doctors ordered a CT scan of his chest to find out the condition of his heart. They told him he should probably go have the CT scan within 48 hours because of his heart problem.\n\nThe man went back to the hospital to have the CT scan. The doctor started asking him questions about his relationship with his girlfriend and what had happened at the end of the night. The man said he didn\u2019t know any of that and would have to go over them and get back to the doctor. The doctor said the patient was unstable and you won\u2019t be able to tell anything from the CT scan.\n\nWhile the man was being examined the doctor had him write in his notes that the man had a friend his age who was the same height as him. The doctor asked the man if the friend was around. The man remembered him saying his name was Joe. The doctor asked the young man to go back to his friend and see if he had any pictures of his girlfriend, in case the friend also had pictures of her.\n\nThe man ran to his friend and found pictures of Joe\u2019s girlfriend and her dog.

There are some good links at the end of this post on how to write a resume, to get an education and to put together a job spec.\n\nOkay, enough is enough. Since this post is the introduction to the topic, now we're off to the races!\n\nOne of the most important things to know before you start creating Doberman puppies is how many Doberman puppies you will be creating. You might want to look at page 1, where there are the answers to the first three questions. There are five puppies to be created from each litter. This is very important when you start to create the pups themselves.\n\nOnce you know how many puppies you have already created, it's time to start creating the pups. We'll start by creating a Doberman puppy, which is a good practice, because it will give you a good feel for how to develop your project. So, let's start with building the Doberman puppy.\n\nYou can see in the image on right at top of this post, how we are building a Doberman puppy! A Doberman puppy will have an orange tip on it. An orange tip on a Doberman puppy has the following characteristics:\n\n1: An orange tip means \"the Doberman puppy\"\n2: An orange tip means this puppy will be used for breeding. We will breed the Doberman puppy with a Schnauzer puppy.\n3: A black point on a Doberman or Grey hound indicates that the puppy will be killed. We will kill the Doberman puppy if this puppy ever kills a Schnauzer.\n4: An orange point on a Dober-dog indicates that the puppy will have puppies only the first time it crosses its white coat over the black coat of the other dog. Only the second time will all puppies be born white.\n5: The black point on a greyhound indicates the following:\n1: It is a p", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

{"text": "Carry object\n\nSchnauzers are breed of canine with medium-sized ears, a big tail, and a short nose. They are well-known for how they are sociable and well-behaved. A Schnauzer is a great dog for a family. Even though they are quite playful, they are smart and have great sense of hearing. They are good companions for you along with being great family dog. They are known for being a highly intelligent dog and they can distinguish a cat from a child through their nose.\n\nOne common theme that I have had with people coming into Schnauzers forums is that they have no idea what to do with a Schnauzer. In my opinion, the best training is just a combination of hands on and pet based teaching. The more you work with your dog, the faster you will learn some of commands for the dog (you could even try to get your dog to say the commands using the words). Then, have a play session with your dog every day for at least 30 minutes. For me, the play sessions consist of a game of fetch with a toy or a game of tug of war using an object to see who does better! Dogs love to see the other dog react while getting to see you do the command or play. I really consider this as play time with your dog, so take some time to focus on those activities. Also, take your dog on a longer walk every once in a while. I like to walk my dog in order to get his exercise, which is also good for his back.\n\nAlso, be very careful about any weight training you are about to do to your Schnauzers. I hear that it can be done safely but the weight can be really bad for them and I don't want you to become over weight because of it.\n\nSchnauzer Forums\n\nI started the Schnauzer Forums mainly to ask people who have dogs to post some advice so I could try and give some guidance on training my Schnauzer.

I cannot really think of where these two would not be on the same level. When I say the breed is hard to train, they probably are being unfairly criticized. If people really are that hard on dogs, then there would be no reason for them to own them.\n\nB): This is a real problem. They have not really changed all that much over the years. They do have their special quirks and are a bit like cats in this sense, but they are really smart and fun to meet. I would not necessarily say they are as hard to train as an Australian cattle dog. They're the most obedient canine I have ever encountered and I would recommend that if you get one for your family, you become a vet. They will have the best temperament for all manner of things, except people. They would not be for everyone. A good owner will keep up their pet's routine and spend at least an hour a day with the dog so that it thinks of them as a person. They have a very different way of thinking and behaving from the rest of the general public. When you own a doberman, it is up to what you think of them and how you treat them.\n\nC): I am an educator and we can't afford the temperament and behavior that these two require for us to continue to teach.", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

{"text": "\"A\"\n\nInput:Two of the same type of dog were running, and the third dog was coming in third. Which is the fastest dog?\nOutput:  \"B\"\n\nAnswer:\nThere are two things to consider when learning how to solve a Sudoku puzzle. First, you must select the correct squares, then you need to find a solution by subtracting the squares you chose. For example, when the squares are A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, the puzzle says you must subtract A1, B1 and B2.\n\nThe correct answer to the question is 8. The correct answer to this puzzle is 2.\n\nWe ask this question because the correct answers to each puzzle is 2. This can be seen by looking back at the last six puzzles. If you look back at the last six puzzle Solved, you can see that the correct answer to the first puzzle is 2. This tells you that it is impossible for each of the above eight puzzles to be solved by only two answers.\n\nHowever, there is only one way to figure out the answer to the second, fourth, sixth and ninth puzzles. Let us think back a little and figure out the rules.\n\nThe first rule is that two numbers must always be even. There are two ways that two numbers can be even: 1) all of the numbers that are adjacent to each other must be even, or 2) the smallest one, plus one, must be equal to the largest one.\n\nLet us look at the rules of our exercise, and this will be easy now. Each of the nine puzzles are 3 by 3 columns. The first three columns contain only the number one. Therefore, the second three columns contain only two numbers: 1 and 2.\n\nThis is easy enough in the first three columns. However, in the last three columns, two numbers are even and two are odd. In these last three columns it is impossible for numbers 1 and 2 to be equal to 3. Therefore, the second rule only applies to one of these three columns.\n\nAs soon as you can solve all six of these puzzles, move on to the next column. The first three columns are: 1, 2, and 3. In the last three columns, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 are just numbers, and thus they are even. Therefore, these columns are not even.\n\nNow that the above six puzzles are solved, move", "answer": "E: cure"}

Choose the most correct possible solution.\n\nTo do this, enter the following options to choose a solution\n\n1. The light sensor should produce an output \"ON\"; if the bulb is OFF, the output should be \"OFF\".\n2. If bulb is OFF, and the sensor indicates that it is energized, then when the bulb is turned on, an output should be \"ON\".

The average of the dogs taken 2 or more puppies was 9.2 which means that the average dog was cost 10.15 times too the average that was taken. The average of the puppies that were in between the average of the puppies taking 4 or more was 13.3 and the average of the dogs getting less than 4 was 15.7.

When she discovered it she became really angry, and yelled to make sure you understood that you weren't allowed to take the puppy.\n\nThe number of Dobermans in the world is 20. Therefore the number of Schnauzer will be the same, because they share the same genetic material. Therefore you must have a Schnauzer and an Doberman in order to equal 90. Therefore, the number of Schnauzos will be 0. Therefore, the number Dobermans will be 5. Therefore the number of Dobermans puppies will be 20. Therefore, the number 20 must be smaller than the number 35. Therefore, the number 35 must be higher than the number 4. Therefore, the number 4 must be smaller than the numbers 9 & 8. Therefore, the number 8 must be smaller than the letters of the alphabet. Therefore, the number 9 must be higher than the numbers 1, 7, & 0. Therefore, the answer is 5.

{"text": "Choice A\n\nInput:A housewife, dressed in khaki, is sitting at her desk in the windowless little cube room, thinking about a trip to Bangkok with her husband. She is feeling a bit melancholy that she was to be there and that her husband couldn't keep the promised promise because he and his job were having trouble. Thinking of all the little things she had planned to do in the five weeks she was in Bangkok. One important thing that she always made a point to do is a little shopping spree to celebrate her 40th birthday every year-a trip to Bangkok. Over the years, many of her friends have become married and one by one the trips have become more elaborate as well. On the other hand, her husband has always been very particular about where and with whom she should go. She was always careful to do everything right in any trip she undertook and, knowing that her husband has his faults, she went anyway. She had to buy a new purse because her wife's had been stolen. A new handbag with little pockets to carry her small stuff. A new bag that could also be used to carry all the clothes that her husband had bought for her. One last thing. She was sure that her husband would ask that she pay for the plane tickets for his trip at some time. She always said no. Then she saw a very expensive looking necklace on the dresser in her husband's flat and wanted to get it. He would only allow that one day at least when he was not working. This was her last year to get her wish and it would be her birthday on Dec 28 and her husband worked that day, just as it had been every year they had been married. So she decided that, when she had enough money, she would make the trip. She would pack all her old clothes and accessories. She had bought something like that in Bangkok once many years ago-it had felt very nice. She didn't expect the trip to be so long this time around. The problem now was how she was going to pay for her trip. She had a small part-time job as a maid in her husband's flat. That way she could pay for her entire trip. It was still a little sad since she knew it would be for no purpose. Her friends had bought clothes in Bangkok and she wanted to have just her basic clothes for the trip. Her husband would take them away from her when he came up to the flat. She felt sorry for herself. She knew that the trip would be", "answer": "E: control"}

She tells herself that she hasn't seen the man in two years. She turns her head, looking just as long, and then continues on her way. She walks past the man and goes back to her home, which is across the street from where she left the man last. She tells her children that she has seen him, and then asks them what they'd do if she showed up there again. They reply that they'd call the police. The woman is a bit confused, and asks, \"But what if I'm pregnant?\" The children reassure her that they wouldn't do anything to her at that point, but it's hard to feel comfort when you can't even look at the man you're supposed to be married to. The woman's husband asks about the missing man, and she admits that, maybe, there was a misunderstanding between them. That the man has left her, and will never return, and so he's not really her problem. The man doesn't speak, but he says that he has something to tell her. She turns around, and he walks across the street. They've never actually seen each other, but there was a bit of a misunderstanding, and if she calls the police again, the authorities will have to search all the houses on the block as well, to make sure that there are no other men out there that might be after her.

The man replies, \"Who am I?\" The police find the man, and ask if he would like to talk to anyone. The man says that he has no idea who the woman is, and that he doesn't remember seeing her before the last time he'd seen her. The police ask if there are any other missing people. The man says that that's the longest he's been gone from home for in almost 20 years. The officer questions the man about his employment, and he replies that he's not happy about working for a government agency, but that he has to do the job.

However, there is a German Sheporthund, a Pomeranian, and a Golden Retriever. I don't know a lot about the breed other that they are a lot smaller than a Doberman. I suppose I don't know enough about what makes a dog a dog to know that they have the same kind of heart.\nI personally feel that any dog that can communicate can learn to speak. I was talking about the doberman from your description. I don't think this would be an unreasonable question from a kindergarten or primary class if there is good cause. My guess is there is no good reason or real need for a dog to be taught to speak. If you want to teach young dogs, I guess they would be better off if you would only be teaching them a few words, though I hope not more as your students will end up learning the other words as well.\nJust my two cents.\n\nWell I had two doberman puppies and they have been training them since early childhood. The only thing they did during puppyhood was play and they have still been playing ever since. I don't see the issue. If they want to learn to talk then they will probably learn words.

First the doctor asks to see your prescription. Then he or she gets copies of the prescriptions written by other doctors and you have to sign the signed prescriptions. And since you have signed one of the prescriptions, the doctor may be obligated to get the rest of the prescription drugs for the rest of the day. If you aren't in America, then the doctor may have to come to your home, fill the prescriptions, give you the pills and wait for you to go to a lab to draw a blood sample.

There is an answer for all possible numbers of Schnauzers.\n\nDoberman puppies and Schnauzers can be compared. If an animal has been trained to take a test it can pass that test. If the animals in the pictures above have been trained to use a pencil which is then filled with ink, then there must be more dogs at the front of the classroom than Schnauzers. In order to find this out the number of questions I should be presented in the next question is 100. There are five less than three. There is one less than two.\n\nIn the next question there are 10 questions which only count the number of Dobermans so there will only be a difference of 30. In this case there must be 100 Schnauzers out of the 10 questions. In the last question there are 60 questions out of 70 which count only the difference between the numbers, so there will not be a difference between 15 Doberman puppies and 60 Schnauzers.\nThe answer is 60.\n\nThis question was correct for the question with no answers.

A huge problem that will cause great suffering at great cost to humanity. If we do not act immediately we will be on the brink of causing our own extinction. We could try to slow down the pollution and reduce some of our overusage, but many of our products are destroying our planet. We would have to change the way we see the world and try to live within our means and resources. We know this won\u2019t be possible, but it is possible to slow down the problem, to adapt to the changing environment, and it is possible even to eliminate our need for petroleum. We can\u2019t do it all at once, so we will gradually have to come to terms with our current situation. When we do, we will find ourselves in a much better position to deal with the rest of our issues. What can we do now?\n\nI believe it can be done.\n\nHow to help:\n\nThe best solution is to make a serious effort to reduce your use. Even if you cannot do that you should make reasonable efforts to reduce your impact.

{"text": "4\n\nAnswer: A is probably correct on this one. A lot of Doberman breeders breed for the Doberman's ability to hunt foxes, bobcats, and other big game animals using scent as their method of tracking. As a fox is large and can move fast, dogs usually have to chase after it. Once you have your Doberman's scent, they are quite confident and will chase it down rather quickly, and most Dobermann breeders use this method.\n\nYou should also not breed Dobermans for their intelligence like some people do. Although Dobermans are intelligent dogs, they are not considered well socialized. This puts them at a slight advantage over the less well socialized dogs of the other two dog breeds.\n\nDobey\n\n05-17-2014 03:46 PM\n\nYou should make the correct answers for all the multiple choice questions in this thread.

I have always wanted to play the piano however my parents would probably put a stop to that sooner rather than later. I would never let them know however.\n\nMy friends in class that I don't really care about really annoy me. They make jokes, don't take notes and really are just not that good at school.\n\nI have a friend that I really like, he is fun to hang out with, but he does make some questionable choices that most people would never choose to do. He has a thing for my brother as well, and even though I'm pretty much his best friend, I have to let it go in the end.\n\nI like to read, I hate school, however I have never struggled in it. I love music, I sing in every class, and my favorite place to read is the library.\n\nIn addition, this essay should have focused more intently on an action that was demonstrated versus something that was stated.\n\nHow did you decide on this theme and the format? If you had to do it again, how would you do it differently?\n\nOverall, I think this question is very well written and fairly easy to answer. However, I think that the word choice is what made the question appear more difficult and gave students the illusion that they could possibly miss an answer by that much. If you give students multiple choice on how to answer the questions, you need to give clear indication on where to answer each question, otherwise it just gives the impression that the students could answer the questions in a different way.\n\nWhy would you write this essay?

So if you ever have a question about anything and it's a question you really don't want to have to come up with an answer for yourself, then feel free to skip ahead and use the Rule of Thumb.

{"text": "45\n\nThe question here is: What are the chances that you'll get four new items through a set of 100? Answer: There are four combinations to get a new item based on the game: 5, 10, 25 and 50.\n\nThe number of people the two dogs will interact with depends on the number of days they are separated. The chance is very low. One dog may interact with both humans and the other dog.\n\nThere are four possible actions on the card. As there are more rows and columns, the chance of an outcome increases. For example. The first three rows contain the four possible actions. The third row contains only the third row, meaning the first row counts the same as the second row; and the last row counts the same as all other rows.\n\nA dog that lives in a town of 100 is more likely to interact with four people at the beginning of time than four people at the end of time. But the chances are still low. This is even the case for the fifth person to meet this dog. The chances of the first and the second meeting decreases but remains the same with the fifth person as with the first, the second, the third, and the fourth people.\n\nA dog can have a high chance of interacting with people.

I have tried searching the internet and cannot find answers. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks\n\nA: Doberman puppy\nA: Schnauzer puppy\nA: Schnocker or Spitz puppy\nA: Lab or Dooder puppy\n\nAnswer: A Schnauzer puppy is a light-colored German Shepherd of 5-7 lbs. With brown eyes, a large coat and white patches. A Doberman (German Shepherd) puppy is a medium sized dog of 6-9 lbs.\n\nIn the United States, Doberman's puppies (or Dobermani's) and Schnauzer puppies (or Dobermans) are sometimes referred to as \"lab puppies\". Both A Doberman and a Schnauczer are German shepherd breeds, but a Schnauzer tends to have a stronger coat than a Doberman.\n\nAlso, A Schnauzer puppy tends to have smaller paws than a Doberman puppy.\n\nAlthough the breeds are closely related, they have very different physical attributes and play styles. Doberman's play more aggressively than a Schnauzer. Both are powerful off-the-cuff fighters, but a Doberman tends to have a more robust play style.", "answer": "B: tennessee"}

They are not predators. They are prey animals. They are animals like dogs, dogs are prey animals. If you feed and train a dog to not be a prey animal, guess what? You make a predator out of that dog. They are all different. Dogs are all pretty much the same, wolves are different. Cats are different. They can run faster than dogs, and that's about it. Cats prefer to have nothing to do with dogs. If I were to say, 'What cats like?', I would be telling the cat, 'You like sitting, you like to eat. What else do you like?' Cats need to have enough space to run around and hunt and kill things. You cannot train a cat to keep its teeth clean. If you took a cat, say, a German Shepherd with those teeth, and you gave it some brushy things that did not harm, the first thing it would do is go into food aggression mode, which causes it to destroy your garden, kill, and destroy the lives of people and animals. Cats want to play, they want to hunt. They want to eat, but they don't want to kill. They can eat anything. If you train them to do things one way, you are turning them into something they don't want to be. Dogs and cats both eat, but cats prefer to use their mouth more as a predator mouth, not for eating. Dogs like to eat people, cats only eat plants. I don't know, it's pretty obvious. But cats are not wild animals, they are", "answer": "D: trouble"}

He thought it was a dollar because it had a $ on the head. After a little while he noticed that it had an \"S\" on the rim. He then began wondering what the S represented.\nAs he learned more about how the coins were created he came to the conclusion that the dollar didn't have the \"S\" because it was made of silver. As a result, on his silver dollar coin there were more words than just a dollar, and some were left out. His coin had so many words in it that it was in no way fit for circulation.\nAfter a little while the boy realized that he could split the coin three ways. He chose the number 7 as a place holder. He didn't care what he got so long as it wouldn't be a dollar. So he split the remaining 7 coins 3 ways, giving him the following money:\n7 $10 $5\nEach half ounce of silver silver had 1 $7 on the coin. The $5 was divided 3 ways. The $10 coin, being 2 ounces, was split 3 ways. The $5 still had 1 dollar for a total of 5. On the 7 coin was written the \"S\" from a dollar coin, which was left off.\nThe difference between the silver dollars that he had split had an equal amount of silver. The dollar coin that he had split 4 ways had a smaller amount of silver.\nThe difference amount of silver between the coins that the boy split by 3 ways still had the same amount of silver. He had enough silver to divide equally.\n\nIn a business school business simulation, class decided to develop a service that could serve as a replacement for the ATM in a bank.

When I woke up the next morning the pain was so bad that I had to ask my Doberman to help me to the toilet because the pain wasn't bearable. I've got a lot of work on the stairs before that happens again. I need to work out, strengthen my legs more and to get a cane instead of using a rope. Do you think the Doberman can help me with this? How should I work to get better at climbing up these stairs? Would a small dog like Doberman really be helping me with this task? What would your advice be?\n\nHi Linda,\n\nIf you're comfortable with the dog, I think that you can have a good time up the stairs with him/her, and that you can find the right dog size from the dog shop for your personal needs. However, if you're not comfortable taking your dog up the stairs, a small dog would be better... or you could train the dog yourself to be a little more gentle. I'd like you to tell us more about it, to see how you can change the situation to your liking.\n\nA: If you ask him, he will have his own plans and do his own thing but we all know that he listens to us a lot.

When I turned thirteen I asked my mother if I could have a dog when I turned fourteen, she agreed so I brought home a mutt named Sushi. When I turned sixteen, my father got to work and set up a puppy mill in our kitchen. My entire family has witnessed the abuse that Sushi has suffered in the last ten years that have led our family to move to my father's house in Mexico. When Sushi was thirteen, she had puppies and they named her Lili. I named Sushi after my older sister. She took one look at the puppies and ran away when my father was gone. My father bought a small house next to the mill and took in the dogs. Two years after the mill went out of business, my father got a divorce and moved my sister and I to Florida. My mother works very hard to take care of us all. When the mill closed I went to live with my father near the mill. Every morning I wake up and my father starts feeding me. One day he told me that he didn't want to feed me so I came running in with the puppy I got after the mill closed. My father wanted to get rid of him, so he hit him real hard on the head. The puppy died and he blamed it on me. I am currently studying animal sciences at a college down south. I have two pups and a little dog with me. When my younger sister was fourteen she had puppies and she named them Daisy and Lily. When I was fourteen I asked my mother if she could let me have a mutt named Sush. When my mother agreed, I set a trap for her dog and released it. When I saw Sush run from me I ran after him and scared him back into the house. When I got home my mother found him and I was able to take him to the shelter where they cared for him until he died from his injuries. After Sush died my father put my sister and I in a room next doors to the mill and they live with my brother and his wife.

{"text": "B\n\n\"Why have you failed in life then, you fool?\" The man in the street is always trying to answer that question, but he can't because we all failed in life.\n-M.E. Miller\n\nThe Doberman has a reputation as being extremely loyal, and that is due to their intelligence and devotion. They have a very intelligent dog and are extremely loyal. They are a very intelligent dog and do not like to be in a situation where they feel they can\u2019t trust someone or do something for themselves. They are very loyal dogs and as long as you get them when they are able, they seem to be happy to spend time with you. Although they can bite, they tend not to with dogs their own age or older. If you get them too young, they will bite until you have to force them to stop or put them somewhere.\n\nDoberman puppy\u2019s are very smart and know instinctively what they have to do. A well trained and social Doberman will do fine in an older environment, but it may be hard to socialize a Doberman since they are so independent. Most people give Doberman puppies their first few years with lots of playtime, but the same thing can easily go wrong. If you force them to listen to you, they may start to associate their owner with commands instead of the person they should be acting on. Remember when the puppies are puppies it is best to give them time but by the age of one you have to start paying attention to them and teaching them the commands. A good rule of thumb is \u201cNever give a puppy to a child\u201d. Some puppies can be good around children if you have a good connection but with some of these breeds they can get territorial and might not want to go to a child\u2019s bedroom if you don\u2019t live in the house. You really need a dog park and a dog-sitter that knows what they are doing.\n\nI hope this helps and good luck with your new puppies you have created!", "answer": "D: lose weight"}
{"text": "C\n\nI think a master control in the basement is a bit of a stretch. Probably another one of those cases where the author thinks things look cooler from this perspective and it isn't really correct because they'd already be inside. It's like saying there is a master control for the TARDIS' gravity waves.\n\nWhen I was younger I read that an episode of Doctor Who featured a timey-wimey device similar to what the Tardis has, and it took place in the basement of a London office building (they even had to create a fictional office block to show the space between the floors). It's been a long time, my memory is a bit hazy on this.\n\nThere is a Tardis time machine episode from the UK broadcast in the 70's. It appears to be in a basement. There is also a short story I think from the U.S. broadcast that takes place at a computer company in a basement.\n\nA computer company? That sounds like a place that should be underground but has somehow survived up above... That doesn't make much sense given their current state of business and how much money they make.\n\nThe BBC has the resources to build the Tardis for a little less than it would cost to build a real one, so why not do it in the basement?\n\nThe space between floors and corridors also makes for an interesting story.\n\nHere's a question for the readers.

You visit her every chance you get. She is taken care of well. Now you have to decide. It does not seem fair to your brother. But if you are unable to cope, the result will be his end. Can you see yourself doing this? And if the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d what you do is dependent on what your brother does. Because you are too sick, you cannot risk what your brother may do. He may blame you, and the decision will be his. And, you and your mother will pay for your brother\u2019s sins just as much as they have paid for his. Can you see yourself being responsible? And when you are not, you will owe it to yourself, your mother, and your brother to know what you can or will do. Can you see yourself in that position? Or do you feel responsible for your brother\u2019ss life, even if he is to blame???\n\nInput: When you turn 19, what will you do to be independent?

Because in the story the children do not know where the puppy's birth was, the number of puppies are not really important. What the difference between the number is a matter of preference. If the number of puppies is 20, how to answer the question: \" How many Schnauzer puppies are there?\"\n\n2. The word \"safe\" does not mean that the package is covered with some kind of security barrier at the airport. In fact, it means that the package is insured. This statement also does not really mean that the safe container is safer than other containers from which it arrives at the airport. If all of the cargo was examined, you would find that the safe container is in fact as safe as any other container. There could be some items in the package that are beyond the control of the airport personnel. But the security screening itself does not make the container unsafe. There will be other containers used at each place where a package arrives that are handled by the security personnel, as well as other packages that will be handled by humans themselves. The package that arrives at the airport can be examined at different places.\n\n3. Doberman puppies are not the only kind of puppies that are born on a regular basis. There is also a Schnauzer called the \"Ginger Puppy\". Since the Ginger Puppy has only one eye, some have said that if the Ginger Puppie had been born blind or had a deaf-mute nose (which most people think the Ginger Puppy to be) then it could be seen as a \"safety\" problem. The fact that it had one eye or the other (or that it was blind or deaf-mute) was not a problem because the package arrived in a safe and insured package.\n\n4. When you travel with someone else, then it might be a good idea to put an ear tag with your name on it to help them get through security quicker. Since a person cannot be sure that the person they are with is not taking any illicit drugs or weapons or is an illegal drug dealer, the only way to be sure is to get a name tag so you can keep eye contact with him or her. But a name tag with your own name on it might not be the best way to go, since it might be a good way to put the other person off by not acting polite. In such a situation", "answer": "A: suitcase"}

The doctors removed her kidneys and reassembled them. One of the kidneys belonged to an old man, and the other one was donated by a young girl. The young girl was very proud of her kidney donation. To make a lasting impression, she dressed up as her donor and walked around the hospital asking people for donations of new kidneys. She would be thrilled to know that her donation had helped two people. A few days went by and the doctor heard from another young girl who had been inspired by her donor. She was sure that her transplant helped three people. When the doctor called the student to let her know that her kidney had helped 4 people she was shocked, but delighted. The young woman called the doctor a few days later and announced how much she loved his phone call and how her kidney had helped her uncle, mom, the family, and even another old man. She thanked him for his call and she told him how her kidney had helped 6 people, including the man he had donated to. The young woman's friend also called the doctor and found out that her uncle also needed a kidney. He became very depressed when he heard that 4 of his other nephews needed kidneys. To make a lasting impact on the lives of these 6 young men and 2 women, the doctor arranged for them to have separate transplants from the old man and the young girl. After the transplant, the young girl decided to dress up again as her donor. She wanted to get as many people as possible to know about and raise money for her cause. Within a short time, the young girl reached out to other people in her community and called them up to ask some people in their communities for money about the cause of her kidney.

I made a basket of them, and put them out, then I take her to her favorite toy bowl of her toys, and toss her food into the bowl. I also took her to her favorite chair, and put her toys on it. Then, I took me and my dog for a nice walk, and I gave her some time to play the way she likes, and then took her out behind her house, and threw her toy out of her house, and fed her, and then took her back inside. And we repeated this. So, I think I can prevent my dog from eating my food for awhile. I may give her one of my food dishes, but only to feed her her favorite food out of it.

{"text": "45\n\nThe dog is trained to find specific objects by pulling on a string and by shaking a broomstick (see video at end of course).If the dog goes to the left of the broomstick a lot of times it will pull on the string, sometimes more.If it goes to the right of the broomstick a little, it will not. If the object changes its location, the dog must also change its location.How does this training method work?\nAnswer:\nThe dog does not need to change its location since it knows exactly where the target is located. Hence, he makes no effort to go to the wrong place. The dog only notices, and is therefore rewarded, for looking at the right place. In other words, it uses a simple spatial reasoning process to know where, and when, the right place is.\n\nOne technique to improve the effectiveness of training is to reward the dog with a treat when it is successful in finding what you want. Some people treat their dogs with soft foods like canned dog food or wet food and treat biscuits.\nYou should know that many dogs have a tendency to become discouraged and angry when working on specific tasks. Some dogs like the chase game, especially after a long day's work. A dog that wants to run really fast will not want to do any activity for which he is frustrated. But if this situation is addressed early, before your dog becomes angry, you can use this reaction to teach him patience while training. You should provide lots of good distractions so he is not frustrated by chasing the ball or tug ball. If he is annoyed by trying to play the chase game for too long, you can give him a playmate, such as a toy or a stuffed animal, and the object he is trying to retrieve, or make the game short and simple. So keep the focus short and simple, and he will eventually work out how to get the object he wants, even though it takes longer than expected. As he becomes more aware of the problem, you can gradually add more distractions, including your toy if appropriate, to the game, and he will become more interested in working with you.", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}

{"text": "37\n\nComments\n\nIt could be argued that Schnauzers being in the same group could be a plus - as the Schnauzer breed is small and only 2-3 years old, its easier to catch them and train them - and therefore easier to educate owners. I remember doing an informal poll with my parents when they adopted their first Schnauzer. They asked us to pick a Schnauzer \"best friend\", and we did. I think it was easy to pick out my Schnauzer, though (because she could bark so much!).\n\nIt is a mixed reaction. There are many that don't like the breed, but that's due to the media attention they get. A lot of them can be trained to be good companions and even get along fine with other breeds...but they're more likely to want to fight other dogs that try to bite them or take over when they're playing.\n\nIn all my years with the breed, I've met perhaps one or two of the mean ones...and they were pretty much always under 5 or 6 years old and pretty much in the care of adults, not kids. The most I ever saw was a couple that were the same age and the dogs were under a year in age and they were really small and kind of aggressive to one another...no bites or anything.\n\nIt could be said that all pure breeds are a good mix of various types so you're probably getting a good blend in your Schnauzer as your parents seemed to have a good mix in their dog. You'll see better dog behavior in the younger puppy (who may already have some of the personality traits of you and your parents) but it wouldn't hurt to wait until the older one to get started learning the basics so you can be on the same page as it's the same age.\n\nThere shouldn't be any problems with aggression or fighting. I don't think there are any big differences between different breed dog types. It's just about the person and their temperament.\n\nI don't think you actually need a dog of one type. I think having a dog of multiple types is essential for proper training. I've had dogs that were all different breeds. My one dog is a Schnauzer, my oldest daughter has a Doberman and a Schnauzer, and my next youngest has a Schnauzer and a Schnauzer. All five of my dogs are completely different from each other.

{"text": "A\n\nI'm going to run through this for some ideas on where people might want to be on Monday and how to approach it.\n\nFirst of all, any input that indicates how long the problem will be up is useful. For example, 3 days would be pretty good for some problems and horrible for others. That way the problem can be updated more frequently as people have comments.\n\nAlso, for me at least, it makes no sense to have a very long problem and then give people an arbitrary number of steps as well so long as you offer some advice on which of the various options are most realistic. What I would do is offer a few possible choices and work them down, starting with a few where one of the more realistic options is chosen and slowly working down from there. That way, people don't get a very long problem and are only given solutions in parts.\n\nFinally, I would just give some initial suggestions and hope that people come in on Monday and we can get this figured out. This way, people can jump in wherever they are on Monday's.\n\nAs part of the discussion, people can also have their own ideas about where the problem should be placed for each day of the week. I haven't thought through everything since I'm not going to be here on Monday, but I know that I have some ideas about where this problem could be for Sunday afternoon and why it should stay there versus where it should be Monday. So, someone could give me suggestions for that day and I can make my own decisions. Or someone could suggest an option, especially if they are more realistic and would give a useful suggestion.\n\n__________________\n1. The more things change the more they remain the same.2. I'm not a huge fan of politics. You'd probably think twice if you knew me.3. I'm getting old and the world doesn't owe me anything anymore. I'll get by.\n\nI'd like to suggest moving the problem to a later time. The first few days the problem should stay open and people should get used to it. Then Monday morning should see that this isn't a problem that can be solved in a few days and I think Monday could be a better day to suggest a solution than Sunday. That being said, I do also realize that most people are more concerned with how quickly a problem should go than the actual number of steps involved.

It sounds like you have to go step by step through what you think is going to happen if you don't have enough dogs. I think you have just taken \"X\" to mean \"Dogs will die when you don't feed them\" and now you need to get to step D: talking, stealing, dying.\n\nThis was a wonderful introduction to the issue of how to make a correct answer of this sort.  I've seen this issue presented as a problem before, although in the other case the answer was actually \"The number of Doberman Puppies = (number of Schnauzers) X 45\" but you had to remember that it could also be written in fractions.  You could just get the fraction from the equation right away.  I guess it could be thought of as a \"fraction of X\" problem, with the only difference being that the \"X\" is the number of dogs.  But you do need to use that number as part of the solution (as opposed to just \"X\" being \"45\"), and the answer has to be correct.  But like other problems in this thread you can't just give out incorrect answers since people will get angry.\n\nMy suggestion to your teacher has already been put up, so do your reading.  It's a very straightforward problem.", "answer": "E: die of starvation"}

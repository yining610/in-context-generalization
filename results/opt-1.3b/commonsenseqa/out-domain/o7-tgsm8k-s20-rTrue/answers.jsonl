She asked your parents what the book was about. Can you tell us what the book is about?\nOutput: Rachel Berry is about a young girl who begins to write about her secret life.\nYour friend wondered why Rachel Berry would choose to write about her secret activities for people she did not know. Rachel wrote about her secret activities because she was unhappy and lonely.\nYour friend realized that a good way to make things better was to improve her life, and that if she did that the secret activities would fade away.\nThat was just the first part of Rachel's secret diary. When Rachel Berry finished writing, she began to write down all the secrets she could think of. She wrote her names, the names of people she liked, lists of people she did not like, names of people she had lied to, and anything else she could think of.\nYour friend found the book very boring at first, and she tried to read it in secret.

She wrote down his name and tried to keep that secret as well. But Rachel knew that he would eventually tell her, so she kept that a secret until all of the secrets she had been hiding were out in the open.\nThen Rachel wrote in her secret diary that she wrote this book. And then her friends told her that she did not know what it meant to write a book. And then Rachel learned that books have important meaning, and that if you write down your secrets that you may change those things in the changing seasons of time. So Rachel wrote a secret diary to record her adventures, and the meaning they brought her.\nAfter Rachel's diary was finished and she had finished writing about everything that she had hidden away in that diary, she wrote in her notebook that these secrets were her friends, and she would return to share them with them. She wrote her family's names in her secret diary and the names of her friends in her secret diary. She wrote about her father's and her mother's secret lives. She started to write the story of her life in her secret diary.", "answer": "A: ignore"}

Her car did not turn out well. She can afford to buy an affordable new car that will last her a long time. How much money would she need, in dollars, to get a new car?\nOutput: Sarina will spend $1000 on her new car, therefore her total income is: $1000 + $1000 = >>1000$\nSo Sarina will need $1000 + $1000 to buy Sarina's new car. Since Sarina has $1000, she can afford to buy Sarina's car.\nIn the same week that she has $1000, she also has a $100 gift. This gift cannot be used for Sarina's car, so we only subtract $100 from her total gift income. This $100 gift, which is not a gift, cannot affect her total gift income.\nSo the final price is $100\n\nInput:Mallory wants a new cell phone. Her old computer did not work on her vacation.

She gives half of her inheritance when her second child becomes an adult. She gives the other half when she sells her house. What is her total inheritance from her children?\nOutput: 30 + 20 = 30+20 = 60+20 = <<30+20+50+60+20=60>>60\nJane's total is 60 + 20 + 30 = 30+30 + 60 + 20 = 30+30 + 20 = 30+ 30 + 20 = 60.\nAs each year passes, Jane's income reduces due to the money she gave her children when their children were small.\nSince the inheritance is proportional to the children, Jane's children's income decreases as well.\nSince her children's income decreases every year, we can say that Jane's inheritance is proportional to her income.\nSo the final total for Jane is 30 + 20 - 60 = 20 + 20 + 30 = 10 + 10 = <<30 - 30+30+30+50+50+50+30+30+30+20+90+90>>180.10\nIf we divided 50 by 60, we get 6, so our total inheritance is 60 + 18 = 56 + 20 + 22 + 24 + 25 = 60 + 30 = 53 + 13 = 60\nSince Jane has fewer children than the inheritance, her total inheritance halves as each year passes (so 56 + 20 + 24 + 25 + 20 + 20 = 56 + 20)\nIf we divide 10 by 60, we get 30, so our total inheritance halves as well.\nTherefore, our total inheritance from our two children is 56 * 60 = 56 - 20 = 56 + 20\nSo our total inheritance is 56 - 20 = 60 + 20 = 30 + 10 = 20 + 20\n\nInput: Bill wants to buy a television.

He put 6 drops of the water in each book, each on top of a flower. When the water reaches the top of the page, the bee is released into the water. Who will collect the bee from the water?\nOutput: The answer is one. He was releasing only a single bee from each flower. We would have to find a combination of flowers that the bee would want to go to, as well as how the bees would organize themselves (by type, type, type, or by group).\nIf we were to put the bee in a flower, we would want to cover the flower. Using the example above, how many stems of flowers would you need to cover with water for a single bee to get into the water? We would say 1.5 stems of flowers. Calculate the number of stems of flowers that the bee needs to enter the water in order to get to its water source. Then we can compare that number with the number of leaves on the flower and count the size of the cluster of bee.\nOutput: We would need 6 stems of flowers to form a cluster of 1.5 leaves. Therefore, the bee needs: 6 leaves / 4.5 stems = 6 leaves / 4.75 stems = 1 hive in the water.\nYou need to use an equation to answer the question below:\n$$a$$ - ((a - 4)/6) = B$$b$$\n$$a$$ - (a - 4) - (b - 6) = X$$\nWhich answer is correct?

In fact, going to the bathroom is normal. If it\u2019s about a medical check up, then it\u2019s time to see a doctor.\nAlso, we don\u2019t know if the woman was asking for a physical exam or if she was going to the doctor for a medical check up.\nAlso, we assume that she wants to be there for a check up. We don\u2019t know the purpose and the outcome.\nAlso, how is going to the bathroom related to grooming?\nThis could make it misleading.\nIn our picture, the woman isn\u2019t a very good candidate.\n\nInput: The houseguest has a large collection of books, his mother has several books, his wife has about 5 books and he has 100 books total.

The men have the same work and the same pay stubs, but the men have two different jobs. Which job pays more?\nOutput: When two men have the same job, one job pays more than the other depending on which job they are doing at the time.\nWhen it is one of the men out of work, both jobs pay the same.\nExample: One man works at the hospital and the other man at a meat packing plant but they both report the same hours to the state and have the same pay stubs. One day, one man is out of work and his boss is working at the meat packing plant. The boss looks through his paystub before reporting to the hospital and finds it incorrect, so he pays the hospital man more than it says he should. The hospital man has the same boss every day but does more work without having any problems with him. Whenever the hospital man is out of work, the meat packing plant boss offers to pay him more than he should so he won\u2019t complain. However, whenever the meat packing plant boss is out of work, nobody offers to pay him more. The hospital boss gets angry at both men because he feels that both men don\u2019t get a fair share of their pay, and does not feel like either man is working harder than he is. When the meat packing plant boss returns with a full pay stub, the hospital boss feels that the meat packing plant boss only owes him 1/2.

He has a plan; he will have a minimum 6-foot net and a maximum of 12-foot net, both to be able to fit a player inside. A goes to town and drills 16 holes in the ground. He then measures his net. Since he plans to put the net on a metal post, the posts must both be 12-feet around and have a diameter of 12 feet. Where do you go to find 12-foot long posts?\nOutput: Go to a lumberyard\n6 / 24 = <6/24+4=24>>24\nThe maximum you can hire for a 12-foot post is 4 feet in diameter and 4 feet around. This means that the minimum diameter is 4, and the maximum is 10. Therefore, 24+4=36.\n36 + 16 = 36\nFrom that, 36*36 = 360 degrees\nFrom that, 36/240 = 60 degrees\nFrom that, 60*60 = 90 degrees\nNow you can find any angle that is 90 or less\nFrom that, 60/180 = 180 degrees\nSo the final answer for this question is 180 degrees.\n\nInput: A student named", "answer": "C: garage"}

Logan rode with his dog, who was wearing a tracking collar, but not on leash, but in a trailer. He rode with his dog but with only on handlebar mount, which, if used, would cause Logan to lose control of his bike.\nIf Logan would have stopped to let his dog off the leash when he started to lose control of his car, the accident risk to Logan would be less. Logan would be able to control his dog much more safely by not having his dog on the handlebar.\nOutput: We say either Logan should have stopped to let his owner off the leash, or the probability that it would not have been a major accident is 1/2. So the probability is 1.5, and Logan should have stopped when he stopped to let his dog go off the leash.\nWe can check whether Logan should have stopped by seeing if the probability is even 1:1.\nUsing the following formulas and the probability, the probability of 0.5 is:\n1/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 0.85\nSo when Logan should have stopped to stop his car, at 0.5, his probability was 1/2\nSo the probability of stopping when Logan started to lose control of the car is 2/3, and Logan should have done this at even 1:2 for the 0.5. So the probability of the first accident was 2/3, and the probability of the second accident was 2/3. So the probability for Logan to have stopped was 1/2. This is much higher than the probability for the first accident was 0.5. So Logan should have stopped.\nOutput: We conclude that Logan should have stopped when his owner said to stop when he got near the animal he was chasing. Because he was a danger to himself and his dog had become a danger to the environment by running out on the road to chase an animal and was, in the final analysis, a danger to others as well, Logan's best choice for this case was to not ride his bike after going on the run. The probability that he would not have been injured was 1/2, which is higher compared to saying \"I should not have gone for a run and I should not have had to stop to let the dog off the leash.\"\n\nInput:Liz", "answer": "E: falling down"}

{"text": "What is the purpose of reproduction?\nSuppose a man says that he will pay 50 cents on each book if he sells a book, because he doesn't know how fast a book will sell. He thinks that it will take 2 days to sell that book, but when sales start coming in, he realizes that one day will be enough time to sell the book, and so he sells the book in 24 hours. If he sells 50 books, he makes an $3 profit.\nSuppose that a woman who has bought a book from a man says that she wants to buy as many books as possible. So she offers to pay $4 each for each book. If this book sells for $4, she makes a profit of $36.\nConsider this hypothetical situation:\nMan buys books from man\nMan sells 50 books\nMan gets 2$ profit\nMan sells book to woman\nMan sells book to other woman\nMan gets 2$ profits from selling 50 books\nIn both of these cases, it isn't necessary for the book to sell for at least 40\u00a2, because the first two cases indicate that a price of 40\u00a2 is a maximum, where the book might sell for up to a dollar. So you might want to make the price you are charging a little higher. Even though the woman probably won't buy all of you books, you have a large surplus of books. There's a lot of room in the market for more books, so you can sell them at a small profit. So you could sell books for 8\u00a2 each instead of 8 cents, since 8\u00a2 is less than the 8\u00a2 cost of making them.\nSo the final equation is\n8/2^24 + 8/2^24 = 8 cents = $8 per book\nIn the second case, you can charge a more common markup (such as 2 cents per book), which might not be enough to cover the cost of shipping by mail, but may be more appropriate as a retail pricing device.\nSuppose you are charging $5 per book. Then selling one book for $2 is more efficient than selling the book at the same price, since the other 50 books will probably sell for less than 8 cents each, and if they don't, you will make only a small profit from the sale.\nIn the first example (where you want to make a profit), $1 and 3\u00a2 aren't much different, so you set a price of 2 cents per book.

What is the lowest sales target that can be achieved? How many times will that goal be reached?\nOutput: This is not that easy. But with constant effort and the right market strategy, it can be possible.\nOutput: If you estimate that it will take you about 1 year to get to $50,000 in sales, then by next year you could have $100,000 in sales.\nIf you estimated that it will take you 5 years and 7 months to get to $100,000 sales... then by next year you should be at $300,000 in sales. By the way... how much did you get paid if you sold $100,000 last year?... it must have been more than $100,000 since you had to pay yourself $300,000. If it was only $100,000... what were you buying with it???...\nOutput: Let's say you will make $100,000 next year.\nYou can set up your company to have $250,000 in sales in 15 years if you work at it for 3 years.\nThat gives you sales per year in 15 - 10 = <<300/10=15>>15 years.\nTo make $250,000 in 25 years... you will need 65,150 sales. I have not figured the value of the shares, but it depends on how your company is organized.\nOutput: Let's imagine you buy a share of company and you will make $6,500 next year on it. The current stock price of 1 share now is $20. Then by next year... you will be worth $27,000... so you will be worth $31,000 next year.

If you add up the number of fish from each person, and divide by 100, you get an estimate of how many fish live in each person's aquarium. A fish is worth $20 per fish, so the total amount of fish that an individual individual has in their aquarium is $1000. How many fish in total have a fish subscription?\nOutput: If 100 equals 6 per person, you have 36 fish, 2 per person.\nIf each person had 10 fish, 36 * 10 = 120 fish.\nIf each person has 40 fish, 120 * 40 = 240 fish.\nIf each individual has 50 fish, 240 * 50 = 480 fish.\nIf each member of your town has 100 fish, 480 * 100 = 960 fish.\nThen each member of your town each has 960 fish. So the total number of fish in your aquarium is 960 + 960 = 960 fish.\nTo get the average number of fish per member of your town, divide the number of fish from all members of your town who had fish subscriptions, by a number you calculated yourself, and multiply by the number of fish of an individual person, for a total of 5*120/100 = 60, or 60 fish per person.\nOutput: Divide the number of fish the individual had from their fish subscription, by a number you estimated yourself, and multiply the total by 60, for a total of 60 fish per person. The average number of fish the town has, is 60 * 60 = 960 fish, but each person in your town has 960 fish.\nSo the total amount of fish in your aquarium, is 960 + 60 = 14,000 fish.\nSince each person in your town had a subscription, and each person had a subscription multiplied by a number you estimated, you can say that the town has 64,000 fish.\n\nInput: There are 50 rabbits, so the average number rabbits per person is 1.5 rabbits each.

Let is the sum of the number of days that are 0, 9, etc. Let x * y = 1 + x * y = 0 + x * y = 1. Thus, the number of days that were less than x is 2.\nOutput: Let x + y = 2. Thus, the total number of days that were greater than x is 1.\nThat is a correct answer to the first problem. The second problem is too hard to solve. The third problem is based on the true facts.\nLet (x) and (y) mean x * <3*y:\nSuppose an is the number of positive days in a month and y is the number of days that can be divided by 12. Since y = 11, let (x) and (x) * y = <x*11>10.\nTherefore, the number of positive days is 11/3 * (x-y)*12. Therefore, the number of days greater than x is 17 + 17/3 = 38. So the total number of days greater than that is 38/3 * 2 * 7 = 50. Since 50 is less than x/2, the total number of positive days is 50/2 * 4 * 8 = 102 (51 for x/2).

He could have made $25 a month from making candles and $60 a month from selling them. How much did Fred sell candles for each month in total?\nOutput: Let a be the final score from December's game if Fred was on the losing team. Suppose Fred gave up after the 6th game and decided to quit, which was $200 after his 3-5-0 start. Suppose Fred played for $5 the first day, $4 the 2nd, and then after playing for $300 the last time, he quit. Suppose that over the season, Fred made $300 a month from candle sales and $250 a month from selling candles at craft shows. Suppose he finished the season with a grand total of $400. If he had started with candles in December, it would come to $250 for the entire year and it would come to $30 for the first month. But since he started with craft shows, he would have to give one craft show a month and buy one candle for the first month, which would come to $20. That's $60 a month for December alone and he gets $75 more the following month for winning the first game. He would have to give $150 for the first half of the game to have a final total of $250. If he had bought all the candles in December, it could have come to $300 for the whole season and it would come to about $65 for the first month.

If the Mercedes SUV does not win any more auctions, the dealer will then have the vehicle for free. Therefore, the dealer will own it for free.\nTotal number of vehicles on the block = $3000 + $$3000 + $1000 + $1000 +-$1000 = $10,000\nSo the final answer in total number of cars on the block is: $10,000\n\nInput:On Tuesday,", "answer": "A: contagious"}

The group consists of 10 musicians. Which 10% would take turns taking breaks?\nInput: A musician played the horn and sang and led a group called Blue Note, composed of 10 musicians. In this ensemble, 4 players were each given six (6) 30-second breaks. The musicians each took their breaks at the start, middle, and end of a six minute piece. Which of the following is an acceptable answer?\nOutput: The average time for breaks will be 36 sec. For this piece, the average time for each break has been 25 sec. For the last group of six (6 = half of each group that plays a number of minutes each) players, the average is: 25 + 6 x 7 = 36 sec, so the musicians' breaks will be: 36 + (6 + 7)/6 = 36 sec.\nThus the musician players of Blue Note took their breaks at a rate of 36-25 = 36/50 = 36%\nGiven that this piece had a total duration of 16 minutes (the length of the total performance by all the musicians - half of which had breaks of 5 minutes each), it should take the musician players of Blue note: 16*14=54/66 = 22 breaks.

The city council decided that they do not need to reduce their revenue for one year. They will, however, increase the taxes on people who make less than $40,000 and those who make less than $45,000. Their reasoning for doing this was that they can pay for public utility costs so that they are not in debt. What percentage of the city's money do you believe could be used to pay for utility costs?(If you know only $9 out of $10, how many percent of $10 would be used? What about $15 out of $20? $25 out of $30?\nInput: They will increase the income tax on everyone over the age of 40 by 2%. They will put the amount they can pay the utility costs into their discretionary fund. The discretionary fund is basically a bank account. Once they pay for their utilities and have discretionary fund left over they can use that. The discretionary fund, however, doesn't exist outside of the government. The city does not need extra money during financial crisis.\nOutput: The tax increase will reduce the city's revenue by $11,150,000, so they will have to increase the tax for everyone earning less than $40, 000 / $45, 025 =<<1110+115>$10, and increase the tax for everyone making less than $45, 000 / $45.25 =<<4510+115>$25, so they will have less discretionary income.\nThen their $41,845,000 tax revenue will be reduced by $45,125,000, for $12,000,000 less revenue.\nSo the final answers are $41,845(+>>3$1,000) +$15,325(+>>3$2,000) +$12,005(1+<<22>>$10,000) = $61,305,100\n\nInput:A student makes two $1 bills and throws them both on the ground and picks one up each.

If A is the manager's employee and she wants to attend his party, we should consider his job performance as the deciding factor, in addition to her appearance. If B and E are also employees, then we should consider their appearance to be the deciding factor, and if C and D are also employees, then their job performance must be the determining factor.\nIf we were to consider what we are asking, then if we decide to consider age, then at the very least, we should consider A's age, and if we were to consider attractiveness, then we should consider the age gap between B and A.\nAltogether, 10x = 60x\n60 x 10 + 2x x 30 = 96\nSo after we add in A, we get:\n72*100 = >>72(72 + 100)*100\nSo for some odd reason, the total number of people that attended the party is 72*100*.

Therefore, the answer is A, as expected. However, since the word misery was not repeated the reader will wonder if the woman did something that was not fun, thus making his answer A, as well. However, since the reader did not think the woman did anything that was not fun (even though he thought that she may have done something that was not fun), the answer is C, as expected.

Calculate the time to get it repaired.\nOutput: The total cost of repair of her new car is $300.5, so the total price of repair of her car is: $300.5 \u2013 $50 = $190.\nSince the total cost of repair, due to the bad shape of the vehicle, is $190, the total car repair cost is: $190 x $50 = $190, so the total repair cost is $190 + $50 = $320.20.

This is a number! 3x + 25 = 60\nSince x + 25 = 0, it'll also be zero.\n4 + 25 = -15, and (-15 + 25) = 0\nso (x +25)^X = 1\nWhich means after 5 minutes of sitting under bush or dessert, (x +25) x^5= 1\nOutput: 3x is always one because it's the 3rd and 4th number in the list\nSo (x +25) < 100, so (x +25) is 0\n\nInput: (x + 25)^100\nOutput:\n1+y = 100, where y is the value of the denominator before dividing everything by 100\nSo the result is (x + 25) = 100\n1+y = 30, so (x + 25) is zero.\nThis results in (x + 25) x 2 = 6\nWhich means (x + 25) * 6 = 8\nSo (x + 25)*6 = 6/8 = 3.2\nWe'll choose 3.2 because x + 25 > 0 so it is a multiples of 0.\nOutput: 3x - 1 = -1/4\nSo (x + 5)^100 = 4, which is the value of zero!\n1+y = 10, so (x + 3y) = 0\nSo (x + 2y) = 0\nTherefore (x +25) - 1/4 = -5.25 and (x + 25) - 1/4 - 12.3 = -6.2, and (x + 25x2) = -6.5\nThis value also results in (x +25) / 3.2 = 20\nwhich means the value of (x + 25", "answer": "E: rocks"}

How many apples did they give their friend this week?\n\nOutput: James and John gave their friend 24 apples and 15 peck of carrots, so that he gave them his entire supply of apples to give to the library.\nNote: Both of their supplies of apples are smaller than their supplies of pecks. So they give their friend less than his own required amount.\nAltogether, James and John gave their friends 18 + 15 + 15 = $60\nSo the final answer was $60\n\nInput: Michael and Emily have 100 apples and 4 peck of carrots each. So what is Michael's solution?\nOutput: Michael's answer is (6 + 12x)*100 = 1 + 12(2-2)/(16x)*4 = $4\nThis value is small because apples are a larger volume than carrots, but the fact that the volume is large still works because it means that a smaller volume would be a greater price. So Michael did not give his friend what he cost him - so the final answer is $4.\nSo the final question was $4\n\nInput: Albert was given a quarter by the teacher. Then he took the quarter from the students (100) and gave it to his own (3).

That gives us a total of $10\nA good price for a monkey's book $100\nBingo (25 books in total)\nCandy (100 books in total)\nFruit (75 books in total)\nWater (35 books in total)\nThe total cost of the above books is $40\nThe total loss of money is $15 in this case\nThe total cost of a monkey's book $30\nThe final sum of pages in the book $30 - $15 = $10\n$10 x 15 = >$10\nSo each book is worth $10 and they have $15 in their pocket. $10 - $15 = $7\nSo each book in the monkey's book is worth $7", "answer": "D: zoological gardens"}

Which 10 dinners does he pay $1.25 for?\nOutput: Michael has to pay a total of $2.25 for $10 of food, but he is only allowed to spend $1.25 at each restaurant. The restaurant bills are all calculated by multiplying the number of dinners he has to pay by the amount he has to pay. Therefore, for every 10 dinners, Michael will have to pay $1.05, or $1/10 or 1/10*20 = $26 for the bill at the restaurant. In this example, Michael paid $26.50 (which is 5% of the $10) for the bill at McDonalds.\n\nInput: A guy buys 4 tickets from Jackpot Tickets for a concert tomorrow.

Each student is assigned the task of making a paper wallet. The goal of the task is to get all of the books and money out of the wallet, as quickly as possible. They don\u2019t have to remove any of the loose paper from inside the wallet (they\u2019ll need to do that on their own) and they can use any materials available to them. The only restriction on what they can use is that they can only use paper and paper products, such as pencils and envelopes. They are not allowed to use a pencil sharpener, nor are they allowed to use glue sticks or rubber gloves. In order for James, Sam and Andrew to make a paper wallet with all of the money and books in it, they\u2019ll have to spend less than $10 and more than $20. At the end of the project, they are allowed to spend only $5 each, even if their total dollar amount is $25. The total amount of money that each student has to get out of their paper wallet is $50.

The sentence must be fair. If the sentence is harsh, the criminal may resist and the judge may have no choice but to use force and jail the offender. If the sentence is too lenient, the criminal has a chance of being released if the crime is not serious enough.

{"text": "A - in the audience playing a violin / viola as a soloist E - near all of the other string/brass and brass instruments\nSo here we have the question of the musical instrument. The correct answer is A, since this would sound like a symphony. As we move towards the question of how many other string and brass instrument would be playing in the orchestra, E becomes more likely. If there are only 18 string and brass instruments, then we would expect to hear the viola and violin along side more instruments.\nNow it becomes more feasible to assume that there is a string or brass instrument playing beside the viola or viola soloist. This is the way string and brass bands are usually practiced in our schools and universities. String and brass quartets take a lot of practice time and rehearsal time to really get to know the instrument and to sound good together. They are the group that plays most of the time at recitals, concerts, and other major concerts of larger orchestras.\nFor a clarinet quartet, we have no reason to assume that there is one clarinet soloist, since they are the lowest brass instrument in our scale. This would give a larger scale for the violin/viola.\nSo the final scale question is 16 / 18 = <<16/18=29>>29\nAs we move towards the question \"how many other instruments would be playing?\" We find that we are now at about 2/3 of the population of the human body. A large majority of our body mass is mass in our muscles, which could easily be converted into additional string and brass instrument players. It is reasonable to assume that there are millions of people just like you and me who could be involved in such a system.\nConclusion:\nWhen people do not study their instruments of choice, they are more likely to pick a less difficult instrument to learn the instrument to play. This can lead to the less skillful instrument being chosen by those that are just beginning to learn to play. Because of this, picking a less difficult instrument is a good way to start. Once you know the instrument, you can get more practice with the instrument.\nThis can lead to good choices of the instrument used. There are two things that are important when picking an instrument. First, picking an instrument you can play well and that is easy to learn will give you the most enjoyment. Playing a difficult instrument will give you less enjoyment of your playing than playing a easier instrument.\nFor the violin/viola,", "answer": "D: orchestra"}

{"text": "The final answer is remembering past success\n\nInput:Mary and Alice were given a $25 bill each. Mary must save $25. Which would you do? Why?\nOutput: $25 is $50 if you don\u2019t spend it on something useless. If you spend it on something useless, it is not $50. If you would have spent your $25 on something that was more useful than other things, you would have not wasted it.\nNow Mary should be a smart student because she can divide $25 in a way to get $50 in $50 coins. If she spends $25 on a book, she now has $50 in $50 currency.\nSo she must be able to divide $25 in a new way. Mary has to find a new number for $25.\nSo I will give you a few situations to use the $25 bill example. The first is, you have $25, a book worth $10, a book worth $20, and a book worth $40. If Mary chooses to spend the $25 on $20, she has $20.\nThe second is, Mary bought groceries, and she doesn\u2019t need two coupons. She is too poor to buy groceries, so she puts them on the $25 bill. Then she makes the mistake of spending the money she is not supposed to spend. So now, before she realizes it, Mary has 40 in $40 currency. She has $40-$20/$20-$40= $40-$20-$40-50= $30-$40-$40-$40-50-$30-$40=$60. So she is still $10 short of the goal that she has been given.\nThe last is, Mary is a teacher, and is trying to get a student\u2019s attention. She gets to $20 by writing out the answer, then she finds her pen, which means she is almost done. She still has $25. Then she puts the $25 bill back on the $25 bill, but then puts the $25 bill in a different envelope than the envelope that it came from. Mary gets the envelope that she used to put the $25 bill to her test without having an answer written on it. Mary is not a smart student because she didn\u2019t use the $25 bill that came her way without having an answer written in it.

How many mph is the wind on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, when the wind speed is equal to, respectively, 24?\nOutput: Four\nThe second day of the wind is equal to 24.\nSo the wind speed is equal 24 + 12 + 24 = 30, so the final speed on Monday, Tuesday and three on Wednesday is 30.\nNow, the difference between the speed on the first and second day is 24/10 = 18\nTherefore 18 + 18 = 36\nThen 2/6 = 2.6 =\nTwo thirds of our velocity is equal to 36\nTherefore the final velocity on Monday, Tuesday and two weeks ago is (36)/2.6 = 36/(6) = 36.6 miles\n\nInput: The three people that met on the bus were: A: Mike, B: Mark, C: Ben.

{"text": "There is no solution. We have chosen not to offer anything.\n\nInput: We have a table which is divided vertically into six sides by eight columns. The two main columns are left and right. There are ten columns between these two columns. The columns have the values 1 to 99, and the side columns have 1 to 50. Two rows of 10 columns each are located at the bottom of the table. The width of each column and the length of each row vary depending on the number of columns on the left and right sides. When students enter the rows, they need to move their pointer to different columns to find their answers. Therefore, students can only enter responses in the columns that are visible. The first column is filled only with 1's. The second column is filled only with 0's. The third column is filled only with A's. The remaining columns are either filled by 1's or 0's. So how is it possible for students to find their answers in each column?\nInput: Let n be the number of columns and let k be the number of lines.\nOutput: n - k = n*k, so n = k/1 = <10> <3> <3/6> <13> <21> <10> <3+6>.\n\nInput: What is the meaning of the following question?\n\"How many times will this number be in the first 20 words of your paper?\"\nOutput: If it is <5> times, the paper will be 0.5+5=1.5.

{"text": "B: maps; C: catch bus; D: city centre\nWe know that the bus station has to be located in the centre of the town. The centre has to be accessible enough for bus drivers to go to it and get on the bus. The station needs to be very close to a central street, but far enough away from other street-level features to preserve some of the natural open area on the ground.\nWe can make the station easier for bus drivers to get to by having it at street level and by having it placed near a place where many people get on-and-off bus. At street level, the door of the bus is also in the centre of the road. This may reduce the number of bus stops that bus drivers must make to reach the bus station.\nThere are a number of possible locations for the bus station, and it is difficult to decide which one is the best. We have divided our options by two points. The first point relates to street design. If the main streets are in a convenient location near buses, then there will be fewer bus stops and we can make the station easier to reach. If the street design cannot accommodate these requirements, then we can make the station closer to where the bus station is more accessible via a different route or a second street. We will not discuss these matters further.\nIf it is in the city centre, near a school, or close to both, then the station can be constructed in a convenient location between the school and the central street.\nIf it is closer to the school, then it cannot be in a convenient location between both.\nIf it is nearer some other street, then it is a more convenient location to get on buses from.\nIf it is further away from another street, then it is hard to get on buses that way.\nIf we determine these locations correctly, then the bus stop should be within easy walking distance, or easily driven to, of the station. We will continue with this analysis tomorrow.\n\nInput:How many minutes is too long for an e-mail message?

He decided to donate some of his books to the local charity. The total price that he paid for all books was X * X$ = $($X - $($X-X$))+$($X-X$$)*2= $($X-X-$Y)\nTo divide this by the total number of books he was donating, we divide the total number of books by the total number of days he works 7 days a week.

The person who stands up to shoot the ball scores 13 times faster than the person who shoots from a sitting position. How much depends on whether you are standing up or sitting down?\nOutput: If you shoot from a sitting position, you will have 12 shots for the basket, 5 if you shoot from a standing position.\nSo if you are standing up, then you will have 12 shots, 5 if you are sitting down.\nIf you shoot from a sitting or lying position, you will have 6 shots overall, two for each position.\nSo if the player who stands up gets 6 shots in one minute (the player who shoots standing up and the player who shoots lying down both make 6 shots), then the player shooting sitting up makes 36 shots the minute (the player who takes the seat and the player standing up both make 36 shots) in one minute.\nSo we find that 36 = 1,6 * 36 = 3,4\nThus, if a player is shooting from the same position in 2 or 3 minutes (that is, for instance when the player shooting from the player standing up holds a ball up for one minute or four minutes), then the player shooting from that same position gets 6 shots per minute. For instance, if a player shoots from his sit-down position 5 minutes into the game, then he will get 6 shots in the next minute, but only 4 shots in the next two minutes\nSo the final answer depends on whether you are shooting from the standing or sitting stance.\n\nInput: You have a 10 pound weight in a glass.

{"text": "Bill, when he woke up, saw a pair of eyes about 8 inches from his left. He thought that eyes that big were out of place in his head. He quickly got up from the bed, picked up a can of soda, started drinking from it, and then saw a second pair of eyes just above the can that also were 8 inches away from his left. He was sure that they were also out of place. He took the second pair of eyes home and put them into the can.\nTherefore, Bill's eyes were 8 inches from his left and the second pair were out of place. He placed his left hand on his left eye. The first pair of eyes looked different from the second pair. However, the second pair were exactly where his hand had left them, which was where the left eye was to be.\nAnd so it was because of this that Bill said to himself that the second pair of eyes was bigger than the first pair. While this explanation was right, it was unsatisfying. If the first pair of eyes were out of place, then why did they have to be 8 inches from his left? If 8 inches was too big for Bill's head, how many inches was too big for his eyes?\nIf the first pair of eyes looked the same size as the second pair, then Bill was sure that the second pair of heads were out of place - and their appearance was unsatisfying. But if the second pair of eyes looked different than the first pair of eyes, then Bill guessed correctly. Bill had the right hypothesis. But what did the experiment tell us?\nTo find out, Bill had to remember all the ways one could mistake another pair of eyes for another pair of eyes. There were many and he had to do them all. To find out more, he would have to study the memory again, but while doing that, he'd have to remember if one of the guesses could be used to justify why one of the guesses is more plausible than another of the guesses.\n\nInput: Tom has four books and he donate one book to the library.

So, you make an investment to buy one more cookie. Let $5 = 1 x 3 = 9 cookies and $3 = 5 x 6 = 12 cookies. How many cookies do you have remaining?\nOutput: If $5 = 9 cookies, then the total remaining cookies in the cookie jar are 48 x 12 = 150 cookies, so the total cost for those cookies is $9 + 3 = $12.\nIf $5 = 12 cookies, then the total number remaining cookies is 48 x 12 = 600 cookies, so the total total cost for those cookies are $12 + 3 = $16.5\nIf $5 = 150 cookies, then the total amount being spent on the cookies is $15 - 3 + 15 = $10.50.\nIf $15 - 3 + $10 = $9.50, then the total amount spent on cookies is $9.50 - 3 = $8.50\nSo the total cost for those 600 cookies is $8.50 x 3 = $7.50\nSo the final answer of $7.50 is correct.\n\nInput: The student has to decide how much to spend on an exam so that she will receive the maximum possible score.

There was an average height of 2 feet per meter. How many trees were at each height? Choices: A : 1,500 B: 1,000 C: 200 D: 150\nOutput: From the number of trees per meter, 1,500 trees are in the middleground. From the number of trees in each height, 1,000 trees are at the top end and only 200 trees are at the top of each height. Thus each height is 1,500 times the number of trees in it.\nSo 1,500 * 150 = >8,500 trees. Thus each height is 2,000 times the number of trees.\nFrom the number of trees per metre, 1,500 trees is the average height. So the average height is 2,000 trees. Thus each height has 400 trees at it. So that is the average height in this case.\nFrom the number to each height, there are 100 times the number. Thus for each height there are 400 trees. Now for each height, each tree has 400 times the number of trees below it. Thus, each height is 3,000 times the number trees.\nFrom the total number of trees, there are 3,000 times the average height. So each height has 8,500 trees. Therefore, the average height is 8,500 trees. So those are the values in this case. However, we can substitute A for B or C or D. But these are not the values in this example. As we know the average height, we just have to multiply by the width of each tree. Thus A > B > C > D, and therefore B > C > D > A > B > D. However, we can take this further and say that A > B > C and B + C > D. We know each level is the same height so the middle level is 2,000 times that height. Thus the total height will be 2,000, the average height will be 2,500, and the average height of 2,000 trees is 2", "answer": "D: take money"}

He was in the same room with Peter 4 days, twice on Friday, once on Sunday, and once Wednesday.  So he came to Peter 5 times.  He went a total of 12 times.  If Bob had kicked Peter out the 3rd time, he's been in the same room with him 3 times or 4 times.  This would mean he must have been at the couch once on Wednesday, and been at the couch on Sunday twice (if he also went to church on Sunday).  But that doesn't sound right, so Bob must have visited him 4 times.  So the answer is 4 times or 4*12 = <<4*12=56>>56 times.\nThis would be the 4th time he's been in Peter's company, since he got kicked out three times.\nSo that means he has been at the couch once every 8 days since he was kicked out of Peter's company.\nSo the original answer is 14\n\nInput: Bob has a friend who likes to play monopoly.

{"text": "You'll be surprised. But if you aren't interested in the answer, here a few reasons why:\nPhysical activity releases endorphins, which are brain chemicals that make your brain feel good and feel safer. Endorphins boost your mood. Endorphins allow you to run harder, for longer, and longer. Endorphins can help you sleep better. And endorphins can do even more. For example, endorphins can increase your desire to have sex. Endorphins act as an anti-depressant.\nEndorphins are what make you work harder and more efficiently to accomplish the things you need to complete. And because of endorphins, you get more done on average. For example, running more often increases your productivity.\nIf you want to make the body work harder, you need to start with the brain. To put it simply: It has to be worked on. Exercise helps.\nWe're more aware than ever (thanks to technology, not to mention the media) of how important exercise is to our health. And because of those increases, we are working ever harder to better our health.\nExercise has been shown to reduce disease risk. But it also reduces the risk of death while improving your heart health.\nYou make a habit of exercising, but it doesn't happen out of nowhere. It takes planning, consistency and motivation. After all the time you've put into the effort of exercising, you want it to mean something.\nExercise helps you stay motivated. You need to push yourself through the hard workouts, the tough workouts, and the tough days. So when you want to do well, you can push that harder.\n\nInput: After watching their brother lose his wallet, a 9-year-old sister gives up her money and keeps his wallet. How much money did the 9-year-old give up to buy her brother's wallet back?\nOutput: $5 was given up for her 9 year old brother's wallet ($10)\nHow is a lost wallet valued? It can be bought for $5 if it was stolen or $10 if it's lost. If a wallet was truly lost, it is worth more if it is lost or has been stolen than it is if it is lost. And the more value that lost wallet has, the more money that was given up to buy it back.\nThe above equation says that the 9-year-boy got $5 for not losing his wallet. But is that really true?", "answer": "A: good health"}

Add up the area of each parking spot and divide by the number of spots shown on the sign. Let y = the yard angle that is subtracted from the angle shown below. 0 > 90, 90 > 90, 90-110 = 6 < 6 >> 12, < 6 >> 10. Let 2 = 3. Let 3 = 4. Let 13 = 13 - 12/2 = -6 = 6 >> 12. Let 8 = 8 + 4 = 8 - 2 = 13. Let 22 = 22 - 1 / 8 = 22 - 4 = 18. Then divide 6 / 4 by this sum to get the number of vacant spots in the car. Let 3 / 4 divide this value with 22/4.

In previous weeks, he only was responsible for preparing the sermons, and he has only worked an average of 4 hours per week so far.\nIn this week, Michael was responsible for printing the sermons, answering the tele-presence calls from his office, and running errands for the office manager. He was less responsible for planning the sermon due to the large time and effort that he spent on the sermon and was less involved in the printed sermon due to the large amount of preparation before the sermon. In previous week's work, he was responsible for planning the sermon, preparing the printed sermon, and running the errands in the office.\nAltogether, Michael averaged 14 hours per week of work per week, and he only worked 10 hours per week in the church office this week.\nSo Michael worked 10 hours per week per week, but he only worked an average of 14 hours per week per week due to the large amount that he spent on work and ran errands in the office and did not work enough in the sermons to average a full week's work in office per week.\nSo because Michael worked 10 hours per weeks per week, but he did not work enough in his office to average a week's work in the office per week, he did not have 10 hours of full-time work to average full-time work in his office per week.\nTherefore the final answer is 14\n\nInput: The priest pushed for more orthodox action. what kind of action was the priest trying to stop?

{"text": "There are several places where you would get a bass clarinet. These include a string instrument store, a music store, a church, a music store for churches, a used music store, and a home.\n\nInput:Where do you keep your jewelry? Choices:  a) home b) jewelry store c) shop d) jewelry store\nOutput: Where you keep your jewelry can be in your bedroom, your bedroom closet, or your jewelry box.\nWhich do you choose?  A: bedroom b: home c: jewelry store d: jewelry box\nBass Clarinets\nIn a typical clarinet case, the top drawer holds bass clarinet instruments and the bottom drawer holds accessories such as a snare drum, a mallet, a mouthpiece, and a tailpiece. There is usually a side door that allows you to see through the cases and remove the instruments. These \"doorways\" are often attached to the case by magnets or velcro-backed ties.\nIn a standard case, the bottom drawer may allow access to the horn and reeds, or to one side of the reeds. This has the effect of the case becoming more narrow over time, and the instrument becomes smaller as it ages.\nIn the more recent models, the instrument is held horizontally on a base. This has the effect that the instrument grows more horizontally in size as it ages, but the instrument's size does not continue to grow as much vertically as it did when it was brand-new.\nIn a standard, open case, the top drawer opens and out of the top drawer a bass clarinet slides easily. In an upright, closed case, the instrument must slide in and out of the top case with the use of the drawers. The top case, with smaller dimensions, has to slide in and out of smaller drawers.\nIn the newer models, the instrument slides in and out of a metal plate instead of the top case. This mechanism keeps the case more robust, with fewer moving parts and less of a tendency to become bent.\nIn a bass clarinet case the case base also contains the horn and reeds.

Fill the bottles one-third of the time and use up the water during the first two hours. Fill the bottles half way for the next four hours and use up the water for the last hour of the time between the first and second hours. Let's say one bottle of water lasts 3 days. How many days will the water last?\nInput: You start off with a gallon of water and you fill it once a day for 2 days. Do the following:\nfill half of that gallon when you first start drinking the water\nfill half and keep half for the next two days until it fills up again\nthen fill the rest of the gallon next time you start drinking the water\nSo the estimated time after 2 days is 2 days\nInput: A bottle sells for $1 and lasts 2.5 hours in the first use. Fill the bottle one-third of the way, at the same time, after 2.5 hours. Fill the rest full in the other two hours. That is:  A bottle lasts for the remaining two hours of the 2.5 hours it normally lasts.\nOutput: An empty bottle holds 1.5 gallons of liquid. Divide 1.5 gallons in half, and then fill half each half every two hours until it is half empty (2 + 2 = 2), or half full (2 + 2 = 4).\nSo the expected time is 2 hours after 2.5 hours of filling every 2 hours, or 8 hours after 8 hours of filling it at once.\n\nInput: Your mother dies.

Calculate the amount Benedict saved by not buying the extra games or DVDs.\nOutput: If Benedict saved $1.75 with every $1 spent, he would have $300 total savings. This assumes he saves 40-50 cents per day and will have $300, with a $35 per day return rate, in 5 years. After 5 years, he has nearly $4,000.\nThe following formula for calculating the amount of money saved by not buying extra games is:\n$1.00 - ($1.00 X 4 years + 5 years) = $100\n$100/5+100/100+40= $40\n$40 * 4= $400\nSince Benedict saved $400 for 4 years, $4,000 for 5 years, $7,000 for 9 years, and $11,000 for 11 years, he saved $4,000 + $4,000 +$6,000 = $8,000, making it $8,000 overall.\nThis means he saved about $2,800 per year over the past 4 years, so $8,000 * $2,800 = $160. So Benedict saved $160 * $2,800 x 4 years = $160.\n\nInput:Michael and Nalani live in the same city. When Nalani goes to Michael's parents' house, does Michael go too?

By playing professional sports, professionals also risk injury from the adverse situations. This makes it more difficult for professional sports players to work and make a career out of sports. Therefore, the players may not be able to pay for health insurance, vacation, or other benefits with their pay.\nSo the final answers are: A, B, and D\nB: The professionals are not able to compete for money, since they cannot find work or because they are too physically exhausted to continue. Therefore they do not have enough money to pay for health insurance. Therefore they cannot afford to pay off their medical bills unless they have the money as well as insurance and other retirement assets. They are also not able to afford to take vacation. In addition, they are unable to work other occupations outside of sports while they pursue a career in sports. Therefore, the professional athletes do not make enough money to pay off their medical debt and can't afford to retire comfortably.\nC: The professionals could not play because they would be injured because of their sport. This is because professional sports players work in adverse conditions. Therefore, professional athletic trainers might not be on hand to treat athletes. Therefore, they cannot afford to travel. Further, other professional athletes have physical injuries as well because they work in an adverse condition. Therefore they are unable to keep working even if the sports injury resolves. Therefore they do not receive any benefits from the sport.\nD: Professions playing sports are unable to play because the weather is adverse. Therefore the professional athletic trainers might not show up to the games. Therefore players are unable to gain the training that they need to be successful. Therefore they are not able to play the games because they are not good enough.", "answer": "D: injuries"}

Give all 25 books to Mr. Brown. How much money, exactly, did Mr. Brown spend on books in his house?\nOutput: This is a real world example. So we can assume that Mr. Brown spent $50 on books in his house. Hence, with the difference $50 - $50 = $50 per book, we are to divide $50 per $book, therefore giving us:\n$$50-25=$10\n$7 = $$10\nSince he spent $50 on books, we thus obtained:\n$$$50 / $50 = $50\nSo Mr. Brown spent $10 on books, therefore he earned $50 in total from his book shop.\n\nInput: Mr. Brown had 23 books and gave away 8 to his neighbors. One neighbor sold the books for $5 each. Another neighbor gave the books away for $10 each. What is Mr. Brown's profit?\nOutput: Mr. Brown had 25 books and he sold only 8 books (8 + 8 = 16) for $5 each. But, since these 8 books only cost $5 per book, Mr. Brown had $16 in profit! (or 16 / 5 = 12)\nThus, Mr. Brown earned $16\nFrom this, the final answer is 8\n\nInput: Mr Brown has 50 books and gives 5 books away for 100 each. If Mr Brown sells books for $100 and has a $50 profit, why doesn't Mr. Brown make 150 books or 2,500 dollars?\nOutput: To say that he made 150 books and got $1,500 is false since he made $100 from selling his books. Thus, he should have sold $50 less, i.e. $40, to make 150 books.\nMr. Brown could have earned a $400 profit if he sold his books for $30 each. Since", "answer": "D: become tired"}

You decide to have your 12-year-old son take one of your classes because you would like him to have some business training. What course would you recommend your son take and how much would it cost?\nOutput: I think you want to help your son but don't want to spend time training him yourself. So I recommend him to take either Accounting 101 or Accounting II. We will assume that your son is paying for both courses.\nSince accounting isn't the most difficult of subjects, you will probably get by fine with only taking 4 units of his curriculum.\nSince accounting is part of the business plan for your son, it is best to teach him by working with him on the project he will be assigned. Since we need to know about a total of 12 units, you will probably have to assign him 10-15 hours. If it is 2 units of 2 credit, your son will probably have to do 5-8 hours a week.\nIf you need to learn how to calculate profits/labor costs, there are many programs on video or book that will suffice which covers a similar material: the best place to learn is on the internet and from a book. These are also quite inexpensive and easy to access.\nI recommend paying $80 per hour to have about 10 hours of training. This might not seem like a lot, but remember that you are trying to help your son, and he is 12 years old so it is going to take a lot more than 1 to 1.5 hours per day to complete your goals.\n\nInput: There are two girls who have recently been married and have decided that they want to sell some of their clothes online.

So to complete the work, you need to complete 90 minutes per day. If your work is such that you can complete it within 45 minutes, then it is not very difficult at all to work over one hour as your routine. However, if you have more than 45 minutes free on weekdays, then you may want to adjust your routine as your work requires more than 30 minutes of time.\nSolution to the rest day problem:\nFirst of all, you need to consider how long you need a rest day. We will use the formula 2x = 20 + x to get the answer:\n\nIn the rest day problem, 1 is the number of rest days so we divide 20 by 1 to get one. You need to give one day as your rest day so we use the formula 2y+8= 25. If y is larger than 25, it is difficult for you to work that day. Since you have only 25 hours, y = 25 / x = 120 minutes, so work 120 hours as your routine. This is how many hours you need to work. However, since there are 3 rest days in one week, you can work for the whole of the 72 hours in the week. You can work for any number of the 72 hours that you want, but you need to divide 72 by 2. Thus, your work can be divided into 60-60 = 45 hours. The answer is", "answer": "E: new"}

Who earned the most profit form A, B, M & Y?\nOutput: The entrepreneur did not own any business. Therefore his company only made money by selling his buildings to other companies.\nThus A, B, M made him lose money since the profits were not earned by him.\nThus A,B,M made him earn more since the profits were given to him by his employees.\nAfter his company's success,B,M made it more profitable by selling his buildings to another company.\nThus A,M,B made him make more profit for spending his own money from selling his buildings.\nTherefore the total profit is 8*10/10, which is $8000.\nThus his company made $800, which is about the same as his company made from making houses after building them.\nThus we must conclude that the entrepreneur did not use the entire profit from selling his building, his employee's built a lot more of houses than they bought.\nThus 8*10/10 x $0.08 = $0.08, which is still a large sum of $8000, so only A, B, M gained profit from selling their buildings.

Thus:\n1/25 - 8/25 = 0.36\nMultiplying we get:\n1/25 x 3 = 5.06\nMultiplying for the other person in the photo, we get 5.06 x 3 = 12.06\nSubtracting the areas of the sun from the areas of the people in the picture, we get a value of 0.4\nSo the result is 2/25 = 0\n\nInput: Sanya and Pashmina met on a bus going to New Zealand.

Hence the manager thinks that the wife will improve.\nSince the husband is the owner of a business, he wants his behavior to be consistent. Hence, his boss should be satisfied with the behavior.\nSince the husband has a family, he wants his behavior in his family to be consistent. Hence his parents should be satisfied with his behavior.\nSince the manager is a manager in the office, the manager would be a neutral customer to the husband since he works in the same office. Hence the manager should be satisfied with the husband's behavior.\nSince there are several other people in the household, therefore the husband's behavior would be negative for them as they can never find out about his behavior. Hence, he feels they will give him bad advice and hence their behavior will be inconsistent. Hence the manager becomes satisfied with the husband's performance.\nConclusion: The positive impact on the wife is not enough to make up for the negative impact on the husband.

If John saved all dogs from the rescue and donated 100% of the funds, rescues would take $700 and the dogs would be all donations. Would you recommend donating $500 to rescue animals?\nOutput: If all dogs were donated, then John gave rescue animals $200 each (since he was not making any purchases, he could not give them more than just the donations), which rescue animals would save $50?  Since rescue is buying a large dog, an orphan (that has already been taken by another rescue), a rescued dog, and a large dog, John would save $200. Because rescue is taking shelter dogs and puppies that have already been donated, shelters would be taking in $950 and would save $500, while rescue animals would be giving $200 to shelters.

(both pieces of furniture/ furniture part must be in your possession at the time) or 3) have a special kind of table cloth that sits on the table that is called an \"armchair.\" This \"armchair\" piece is different from other tablecloths because it attaches to the table via the top. This special kind of tablecloth has a fabric that fits over the top, and has holes for people to stand on and to put their feet on. If you don't have an armchair to use, then you need to take matters into your own hands. You could buy one or get help from family or friends who might already have one.\nSo, for example, if your table is in your front yard, maybe you could just put something that supports the table (a tablecloth or some other type of fabric that is designed to sit on the ground might be okay, but you really should get it if you don't have an \"armchair\").\nIf you are planning an indoor party, or you are hosting a friend over, if is possible to get some extra chairs/ tables, then get more than you will need - that is if your house has rooms other than the main house.

Choices:  1: The temperature of the earth 2: The temperature of the sun 3: The temperature of a nearby city 4: The temperature of the nearest lake 5: The temperature of the temperature at the topmost peak in the atmosphere\nConclusion: The higher the temperature at the top, the colder it will be at the bottom. The same applies for the earth.\nOutput: The higher the temperature the colder the air gets at the top. The same applies to the earth.\nThere are 6 temperature extremes at an elevation of 1,200 meters. The temperature at the top of this tallest building is 10.6 degrees C, while the temperature at the bottom of the building is 6.6 degrees C. There are 6 hot, 6 cool temperatures, and 6 cool, 6 hot temperatures, which makes a total of 22 hot temperatures and 22 cool temperatures. The average temperature of this city is 7.8 degrees C.\nSo the total amount of hot temperatures and cool temperatures is 10, but the total amount of cool temperatures is 5.2, because temperatures are proportional to area under the curve.\nSo if the temperature at the top was 6 degrees C but the temperatures at the bottom were 7.8 degrees C, we could conclude that it was warmer at the top. Because of this, at the top of the building it will be colder at 0 degree C, than at the bottom will be.\nAnd if the surface temperature of the Earth is 7.8 degrees, but the top of the tallest mountain is 10.6 degrees, then, it is only cooler at the top, so the difference in temperature between the top and the mountain will be 2 degrees F.\nSo if the temperatures at the top were 7.8 degrees and at the bottom were 10 degrees, then all of the hot temperatures in this region would occur. They would go from 6.6 degrees at the top to 8.5 degrees at the bottom and would be equally distributed throughout the top, while the cool temperatures, which are much smaller in temperature, would occur at the top, but cooler than at the bottom will occur at the top.\nInput: This problem has 20 inputs, including the temperature, so we'll only be using 20 equations.\nInput: This day's weather at the bottom of the tallest building in world, and", "answer": "E: heat up"}

It lists ten fruit and vegetable groups and also an eight-meat-four-vegetable group. What is the most common food group?\nOutput: The most common food groups in the United States are fruits and vegetables. Since we have a food pyramid, the most commonly consumed food group is fruits and vegetables. Since the health effects of each food group vary widely, the best way to know the effect of a food is to look at the effects of the average person consuming one food group, and then comparing these figures. If an average person has 100% of their calories from fruits and vegetables, and all 100% of their calories are taken up by fruits and vegetables, then their cholesterol and blood pressure would not be affected in any measurable way. However, average people with less than 40% of their calories from a single food group are more likely to develop high cholesterol and blood pressure than average people. Therefore, the Food Pyramid has been found to have no effect on individual health\nSince we have a food pyramid and fruits and vegetables are a primary source of nutrients, and since we have the Food Pyramid on our desks, we have decided that to carry on with our studies, we may have to eat at our desks.

Two choices: A: $25 B: $200 C: $250 D: $1000 E: $5000\nOutput:The easiest way to raise money is to donate $25. If you donate $250 to a dog organization, then they can multiply your donation four times. Then they can spend $1000 to buy two puppies. If they make money off of you, then they can multiply that money four times, which is now twelve thousand dollars! It can get very expensive for any non-profit organization to buy puppies. If each donation is $250, then every three months they will have twelve thousand dollars just waiting for them.\nYour donation will also help them out in many ways. First, it will help them purchase the puppies. They might never have the money to buy puppies if it was not for you. Second, since they received such large amounts of money from your donation, they might increase their services and donations to non-profits that need help.\n\nInput:The two brothers have the same amount of cash in their banks and one of them has $15 less than the other.

Since the difference between the two brothers is $130, his total bank account balance is $134.\nSince $34.25 was added to his bank account over the weekend, his bank account now has $132.25.\nTherefore, if he were to go out on the town and spend $20, his bank account balance would now be $133.25.\nSince $10 of this amount remains in the bank, he will not have enough money for the rest of the", "answer": "B: shout at"}

There are a total of 3 books, so the total is $15. A person wants to buy half of the book for $10. He pays $15 (2/$10) for the book so he has 18 books to sell for his $10 investment. (2) There is a book worth $1,000 in the store and it is on sale for $300. If a buyer buys one, the total price would not be $300 but would be 15*$300 = $65 instead. (3) There is a book that costs $200 which is also on sale for $100. If a buyer buys two, the total price would go to $200 but with less profit (the book cost $200 compared to $100) because of the difference in the cost of the two books.

Give each of the 6 participants an amount equal to $50 X the tax amount each participant pays during the 12 months. Calculate the income each participant makes in the year because each person has $50 less income during the 12 months.\nOutput: Let $a = the gross amount of money each participant earns for the year. Then let each participant's share of the income be the $a - the number of months he/she had ownership of the business. Let each participant pay $c X the total number of months he/it owned the business. Then let the total number of individual properties each participant owns be the average number of months the participant had ownership of the business by each property type. In this way, you can estimate the income each participant made in each month of the year. So let X = $a - X / 12 = $c - X / 24 = $c - X times the share of income each participant earned during the year\nSo let $50 = $a - $50 / 24 = $49.4\nSo the total amount of money earned for each participant during the year is $49.4 X X / 24 = $50\nSo the total income earned for that player is $49.4 + $25 X X / 24 = [49.4 - 49.4]/24 = $51\nSo the amount of extra income from that player is $51 + 50 X X is $51 times the share of tax income they earned during the year.

How old is the book?\nOutput: The purchase is $15\n3*30 = 9, so the purchase of the book is $15*9 = $35.\nMichael is getting $35 worth of books. When he buys the book, the certificate isn't taken into account. The cost of the book, including the certificate, is $35*9 = >$200.

In a sentence, why is a pig an animal?\n(Answer the questions)\nA pig is an animal. It has four legs and it lives in a zoo. In the past 20 years, many animals have become extinct, so it is safe to say that in 100 years, the world will no longer have any animals. In 100 years, a pig will become extinct. Therefore, all animals will have died. But that doesn't mean that all animals are extinct, just a large portion. If you don't agree, think about this: If a bear or an elephant or a cow or a horse disappear, that means, there is no longer any such animal. Therefore, an animal is not a dead animal. Therefore, a pig is still alive. Therefore, all animals are alive. Therefore, a pig and the remaining animals cannot be the last animals on earth. Therefore, there will be at least several animals left. Animals are different from plants because animals are living things. They must be able to survive in the wild to reproduce. They can't just sit around and wait for food to come along. This means, they require a certain amount of energy. Therefore, they must be able to move. They also can't be moved by a car. Therefore, plants don't move very well. Therefore, there will probably be many animals that still live in the wild. Animals eat plants. They can't just eat the food from the ground like plants. Therefore, animals need to eat trees and grasses instead of plants. This means, they can't just eat trees and grasses, they need other types of plants as well. Plants are very helpful, if they are in an area where they will need some help. Animals are not always helpful, they can attack the environment for no reason. Therefore, other animals are helpful. Plants are very helpful to other animals. Other animals eat plants, so plants provide nutrients. Animals use leaves and leaves help plants grow. So animals eat leaves to make sure that they can produce food for animals. Plants grow to their full potential only with the assistance of animals. If an animal doesn't get enough energy, they can't produce food for all the plants and animals. This is why animals need trees. Animals", "answer": "B: getting bored"}

A car is parked at m/3 when the other car has one door.\nIf the two cars are further apart than m then we can take it that the vehicle at m=1 is in front of the other one at m/3.\nIf the two vehicles are closer than m, we can take it that vehicle at m=1 will be parked in front when the second one is not parked in front of it.\nFinally, if both are parked at m, then we can take it as a result that vehicle at the rear (at m/3) is in front of the one at front (at m/1).\nSo the final answer for a car that doesn't have 2 doors is m (2/3 of 3) = <3>\nIf the second car is even further back than m then it is not in front of the first car. If the first car is further back than m then the second car is in front of the first one.\nIf the second car and the first car are even further back than m it means that the second car is even farther back than the first one.\nThe third scenario means that the second car will be parked further back than the first one when the second car is parked at m so that the first car does not become parked in front of the second one.\nSo the final answers for parking 2 cars in one space are m + 2/3 = <<3>>\n\nInput: If an employee working at a plant makes $40,000 a month in his salary and bonus pay over a 13-month period, what percentage of his salary should be saved in the salary and bonus pool?\nOutput: Let L = the total savings over 13 months.

What can be done with a circle, a quadrilaterally-shaped object (like the pyramids), and a circle with no other defining characteristics?\nInput: For a circle with no other identifiable characteristic, color comes from the same source as all colors. Color is defined by the numbers of colors that are used within the circle. For example, a black circle has equal numbers of blue, red, purple, and green in it. Therefore, it has the same color as black (or the color of the blue, purple, and green). If we make a black quadrilaterally-sided object (like the pygmy god Set or the Pyramid of Cefn) then we can label the object \"blue\", \"green\", and \"white\"; thus the names of any parts of the object can be translated into the color of its color parts.\nInput:A circular object with no other identifying characteristics. For example the Pyramids at Giza have no other distinguishing characteristics than \"circle\". They are said to be blue-green-white; thus the colors of the parts of the pyramid are blue, green, and white. But, when we look more closely we can see they have little to no distinguishing characteristic.\nInput: A quadrilateral of three equal dimensions. For example, a triangle is 2*3*4 units wide, the pentagon is 2*3*5 units wide, the hexagon is 2*3+5*6 units wide, and the hexagon's pentagonal vertex has 3*6*8 units wide. Since each of these objects can be represented by a 2*3*4*5 unit circle, we can label these objects \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\"; thus the colors of each color can be translated into the corresponding color of its parts.\nInput:Two square units of the same size and shape with no distinguishing characteristic. (Square as in the word \"square\" and square as in the Greek figure of square - a rectangle of equal sides.) For example, two pentagons (with 3*3*5 vertices) is also called a rectangle, a hexagon, or a pentagonal triangle.\nInput:Two squares: 2*2*3 vertices (in this case) - 1*", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

What would the average time of the songs be?\nOutput: The average length of the songs is 10 minutes longer than 10 minutes. So that means that each song is about 10 times as long as it was 5 years ago.\nIn order to find out the average length of the songs, we\u2019ll calculate the probability that a song has played at least 5 times today. So the average number of songs that have been played today is 15/55 = 0.9. By comparing the number of songs that have played today to the number that have played 5 years ago, we can estimate the probability that a song will be played the same number of times today as 5 years ago.\nSo the average length of the last 5 songs will be 1, so the average length of the first 11 songs will be 2, 2, 2, 1, 1 and, finally, 1.1. So the average length of the song will now be 2 + 1.1 + 1.1 = 3 minutes 12 seconds.\n\nInput:The only way to measure the length of a tape is with a ruler. Every video tape has 35 minutes on it.

So the average video has 35 minutes. We can divide A + B by C to see if the end of the video will come in a minute. If it doesn\u2019t, then there are 35 minutes left in the video, so the average length will be 32.8. And if it does come in a minute, then it will be 34.5. So the average length will be 34.\nSo with that, we\u2019ve found out the average length of a", "answer": "D: growth"}
{"text": "Dan installed an old oil stove that is 2 million years old and has been on-off for millions of years. The age of the stove alone can be an interesting problem; what age should the stove be? Dan and his wife bought a new stove three months ago and installed it over the stove that they had. After a week, they found the stove didn\u2019t work properly. Since the old stove was 2 million years ago, this old stove works.\nHowever, it is still an ancient stove. It is almost 20 years old; at the time of Dan\u2019s installation, that stove burned wood. Before the stove, electricity had never been invented. Therefore, this old stove doesn\u2019t burn wood; it just uses electricity. Since the old stove doesn\u2019 t work well, they sold the stove a long time ago to start a new stove. So at the time Dan installed the stove, it was 2.2 million years old; at the current date, it is 4.6 million years old.\nAt 2.2 million years, the oldest stove on Earth that Dan burned was almost 20 years old; when Dan installed the old stove, it was almost 14 years old.

Therefore, she buys 80 cents worth of candy and spends 80 cents to fill the three boxes. Calculate the difference in price for three boxes.\nOutput: The total costs of the three boxes is 80/80 = 6\nSo Alice spent 6 on candy and 6 on boxes. This is 2*6 = 5.87\nSo the final answer of 5.87\n\nSolution:\nAnswer:\nLet x = the total candies she has.\nx + 20 = the total number of items\nx + 20 - 40 = the total number of empty candies\nSo the difference in price is\nx + 40x 80 = 6*((2*60/4)*20)*80 = 6.3*1/4*60\n= 3.8*(9/3)*1/4*60*(-5.87*1/4)\n2.88\nSo she spent 0.37*(60*1/4) * (60/4) * 1/4 in candy alone, spending 3.", "answer": "C: enjoy"}

Calculate how many people buy lemonade and who doesn't buy lemonade.\nOutput: Let x,y be the number of people buying lemonade after they are given $1 and the lemonade cost $1. Let x = 100 and y = 100, so we have (x,0) = 100.\nLet x = 100\nNow let all of the people who are not giving money to Michael give $1 to Michael, and let all of the people giving money to Michael give at least $20 to Michael. Let x = 100, so let all of the people that don't like lemonade give $3 to Michael. Then we divide 100 by 3, we get 100*3 = $2, the number of people that don't like sweet drinks. This is how many other kinds of drinks we have here, i.e.\nD: lemonade, D - 1\nC: water\nC + 1 = lemonade\nC + 1\n\nInput: James has $80 and he is ready to spend it.

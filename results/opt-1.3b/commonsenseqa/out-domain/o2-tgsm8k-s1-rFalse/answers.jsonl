He will also receive an additional $40 that day if the neighbor does not pay him this Friday.  With his savings, he will only need to earn $60 to afford the new bike.  However, if Mary works in restaurants and earns an additional $75 per week, Zach needs only $50 to afford the new bicycle.  Both the neighbor and Zach earn too much for Zach to pay for Mary.\n*Mary is both aloof and self-importance.  Since her experience with meeting people can be stressful, she would have no problem finding somebody to babysit for her for 2 hours on Saturday.  Zach can hire a babysitter for only $7 per hour even though Zach earns too much to afford Mary.  That is why if Zach did not know Mary, Zach would not have enough money to afford to babysit his own son alone for 2 hours on Saturday morning.\n*Zach is stressed because he needs extra $80 before he can afford the new bicycle.\n*Mary is nervous because her last experience with a stranger was stressful and made it difficult to find a babysitter for the weekend.", "answer": "D: being bored"}

He asks someone to lend him money with interest. He asks for $100 to buy a new bicycle, in exchange for a percentage of the bicycle when it is sold.\nThe old man is very impressed with the offer, and decides to loan the boy $100. He hands him the first $100 bill and asks him to return it when he has paid it back. But the old man is already in a mess, so he has to ask for a second $100 bill. This time, the old man gives the second $100 bill to the boy to pay him back. He does so and the boy returns the money.\nThe boy is overwhelmed with the huge amount of money that has come his way. He has given $100 to the old man and now has over $200 in his hands. But, he does not know what to do with it. He has not paid off his loans, but has an even higher debt than he was before he asked for the money. He could lend the money to the farmer, who needs the money badly. The farmer has $200, because the bank offered him the same rate. And he still needs to put money into his business. The boy thinks it is too much money and just wants to go home. But, his father is also waiting on him. He tells him to get rid of what he does not need. He wants the money to buy things for his father.\nThe boy gets upset with his father because he had asked the old man to lend him $100 and then has gone and found $200. He decides to leave the money where it is and walk home. In the process, he realizes that he did not save his money. In fact, he has lost money.

Thank you!\" This was a question that many students were struggling with after a recent math lesson. Many of my students struggle more with problem solving strategies (like identifying key terms and how to evaluate the answer to a question) than they do with reading comprehension strategies (like spelling out concepts and using a dictionary to find key vocabulary words).\n\nThis is something I really want to work on now that I have a solid understanding of how to build readers, but I also struggle with identifying key words in order to find key words in the text as well as with evaluating the validity of a given answer. This can all be used to build readers. This week, I was challenged to work on developing a reader's comprehension strategy that helps me figure out what the student is looking for when they read a passage that I'm teaching them (for instance, my second graders were studying for a standardized test in social studies this week). The first step is to establish a baseline for what the student can already figure out and what they need to do in order to be able to figure out what an author did or why the author did it. Many students struggle because they think the author did something odd or was unclear about something. I have to remind myself of what I already know by first asking the student something like, \"Based on what you understand of the passage, what does this passage say in regards to...\", \"Are you confused about the author's intentions?\", \"Why have you found this passage confusing?\", \"What are you struggling with?\" or \"How can I help you better understand the passage?\"\n\nThen I can ask another question like, \"What is the purpose of this passage?\" Once I've been able to get a student's thoughts on", "answer": "A: attached"}

{"text": "nothing\n\nInput: The girl Mary's friend, Anna is 15 (and 7) and likes to play dress up.  Anna has two older sisters:  Anna's older sister, Sarah, works all day and is at the hospital all night. When she's not working at the hospital, she's at school, where she is the captain of volleyball.  When she goes home, Anna plays dress up with her mom every afternoon.  There are two dresses Anna and Sarah wear at home.  They each have their own favorite and that dress is called Anna's Dress.  Anna often carries her older sister's dress on trips to the store, where it gets dirty.  One night, when Anna is playing dress up, she puts on Sarah's dress and it catches on fire.  Anna puts the dress on Sarah's arms and the fire dies down and they put it out.  Anna's mom takes the dress, takes it home and puts it away.  Sarah wears Anna's dress to play volleyball at home and Sarah doesn't even notice when it smells and wears it the next day.  When the fire breaks out again, Anna is the first to put it out.  She goes home, puts on her mother's dress and the fire dies down.  Anna is also the first to say \"fire, fire, fire\" and is the last to do anything about it.  If Anna says \"fire, fire, Fire\" then Sarah stops playing dress up and her mother won't be upset.  If Anna says, \"fire, fire, FIRE\" then Sara stops playing dress up and will be upset.

When I wrote this topic, they were not really friends. They only had a couple of days to see each other before their classes started. But, there is no such thing as friendship without first loving each other right? When I first told them about this topic, I didn't expect them to be able to answer this. There were even some topics that were really hard for them to explain like \"how many\" and the \"letter writing\" questions. But, even more difficult than those, was the \"picture\" topic. They all said how hard it is for them to tell someone that they love them. I couldn't tell how much I wanted to hug them because I just wanted to cry so badly. Now that I think about it, I didn't tell them this topic in jest like I meant to. They really believe what I said. I think part of their reason to write the journal was to share their happiness to finally have a better life after high school and college. Because they were really looking forward to seeing each other. They felt so happy that they couldn't believe their eyes. I know some parents who don't say more than \"my child is good at school\" when their kids finish their school chores. They simply don't say anything at all.

The authorities put her back with her mother.  The goat gave birth in the woods.  The baby went to sleep, and when it woke up, the mother showed it by nursing it out of her.  The baby grew to about 4 feet tall and weighed about 250 pounds.  The neighbors were so jealous of the goats that they bought two.  They would often get into fights on lawnmowers and mowers in the summer.  One of the twins was a boy who got angry in the hot summer heat and stabbed a hole through the fence.  He was quickly apprehended and the other brother died from a broken leg.  The neighbors were heartbroken.  After they finished gardening, they would all sit down together late at night to watch the goats.  The next morning, they would be up before dawn and have their breakfast.  That afternoon, they would all sit on the porch and have their baths.  The goat loved to eat grass, so she spent her afternoons gnawing on her grass-encrusted horns.  At night, she would nurse the baby.  As each day passed, the neighbors' hatred grew.  One evening, the goats came to their front door and their neighbors started to go with them.  When they got outside, the goats jumped onto the porch and started to play on the steps.  When the neighbors tried to leave, all the goats jumped up onto their laps and waded down behind them and began to lick at them.  The neighbors watched as the goats nuzzled up against them and licked their faces.  Suddenly, the two neighbor goats began to cry.  They could not stand it anymore and", "answer": "C: need food"}

{"text": "Input:\nAfter he has worked hard to prepare for his next test, Alex walks into his class expecting no handouts.  As the teacher enters the classroom he receives a stack of handouts on a table.  Alex picks out one of the handouts and uses it to show the class.  The handout has a photo of a building on either side of a red dotted line.  On the left side of the photo are four colored circles labeled \u201cA, B, C, and D.\"  While Alex presents the handout, his teacher starts talking about the four building colors.  To Alex's surprise the teacher shows him the second handout which has colored letters on top of building names.  Alex writes the name of the building on a piece of paper and sticks it to the first handout.  Before he can read the name, his teacher pulls the paper from Alex's hand.  Instead of writing the name, she writes the word test in big letters with a capital T on it.  As Alex notices the mistake in his work he quickly grabs the next sheet of paper before the teacher is finished.  As Alex gets the paper back to the teacher, she tells him not to go back to the desk.  Instead, he goes to the front of the classroom to stand beside his teacher until she finishes talking about the test.  Alex begins to complain about the test but his teacher doesn't let him.  Alex says the test was boring and his teacher agrees.  The teacher explains that, unlike the other buildings, this one has a red dotted line on the top of it, so all directions are different.  Alex says it looked the same to him.  His teacher agrees.  Alex goes back to his desk and writes the word test on his new handout.  As he reads he realizes that the word test is on the bottom of the handout.  In addition, Alex has circled a name inside the test.

Is it like the kind of thing a 6th grader is supposed to think about during a math class? I find it very hard to take a concept and to teach it that way. Would it be possible to design a course that covers the different aspects of math while they are still in preschool? Even 3 year old math students can make sense of those concepts. We tried this with my older brother about 6 years ago - he is now in high school. The first thing they were taught were arithmetic and algebra. We started out with simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, multiplication by 2's, division by 3's, multiplying by 4's...basically adding and subtracting on our own in order to have an understanding of what those numbers really mean.\n\nI haven`t heard of a math class that covers fractions the way 5th graders would do in the real world.

His parents give 75 percent of his allowance to his allowance each week and the rest is spent paying bills for the family.  For a full-time worker he should have a minimum of $200 in savings.

I think it's helpful for us to help you write out what you think the \"field\" in the field test is.\n\nWhat's your field test question, kiddo?\n\nI have to admit that I'm learning a lot! I'm very interested in your responses! Thank you so much!\n\nYou're welcome!I did notice a typo or two in the answer when I first posted the text! I was going to change the answer after reading back the post, but after seeing that I don't really want to change anything, so I'm just going to go ahead and leave it there.\n\nYour right, \"there is a big crowd\" and \"the crowd isn't that big.\" You would have made a bigger crowd.\n\nMy guess would be \"the crowd isn't big,\" instead of just a big crowd.\n\nThe part \"field\" really gets me. In the word \"field\" you say \"there is a big one.\" Then in the answer \"field test\" you say \"there isn't a one in a million crowd.\" I suppose this is a bit like how when your grandpa says \"not a lot of people\" he means \"not a lot of the people who are around.\"\n\nYour right, kiddos! In the word \"field test\" you ask \"there isn't a in a million crowd.\" Then in the answer you say \"there isn\u2019t a one in a million audience,\" which sounds funny to me. There wasn\u2019t a \"lonely crowd.\" However, if your group was lonely, I would have changed that part of the answer to \"...there was a small group of about ten or so.\"\n\nYour right kiddo about the \"field.\" As I was writing it I kept saying \"there isn't a big one.\" My grandpa would definitely say \"not that big.\"\n\nWell kiddo, the only right answer is answer 1 (not that I agree with you and the grammatical errors you mention). I agree with you I would change field to \"there is a big group.\" The answer is answer one.\n\nNo, it must be the small one as the answer is, \"There isn't a one in million!\"\nYou didn't read my question right... it is a field test, where YOU have to pick a team and go to the \"field.\"\n\nThere", "answer": "C: small group"}

Is he allowed to spend some of that money on himself??\nOutput: 0\nQuestion: 0\nOutput: 0\nAnswer: Yes\n\nI'll be here all day, every day, and I have absolutely nothing to do!\n\nI'd suggest some sort of creative activity. Maybe try this activity in person for feedback and also because it can be fun. Write down some ideas with pictures (you can also print it out if it's too difficult). I think some sort of \"reading\" activity might be nice as well, such as a journal. Or you can just write something you'd do in person.\n(Remember, no judgement, just suggestions)\n\nFor example:\n\nThis is how it works in a real world store:\n\nAn employee rings you up after asking how much you want to spend\n\nYou write down your price on a sticker on the bag with your receipt and your name\n\nWhen you see the bag and receipt you pay on the sticker on the receipt\n\nWhen you walk out with a price tag, you hand to the manager and she stamps your receipt\n\nYou walk out with your receipt and sticker\n\nOn the way down, check for any discounts that you could've gotten. You still get everything but maybe you get a discount on one thing. Or maybe you get a couple things for free if you tell the cashier they're the right size.\n\nBut that's just my ideas. Just get the idea rolling.\n\nThere are literally millions of ways to spend the extra $5!\n\nHope everyone is having a great day!\n\nHugs~\n\n_________________________\nWhat is it really like in hell?\n\nHello there, I\u2019m new to the forum, but I just wanted to say that I think this post is funny. The idea is great, and I like it.\nAs I\u2019ve seen a few people suggest, use some sort of an art project to express your points. I see this working well with some sort of board game or puzzle.\n\nAnd you may want to check out a movie theater in your neighborhood, or perhaps even a movie theater in a suburb of it. They tend to be pretty affordable, and often have tickets for sale and sometimes they have something like \u201cmovies in the park\u201d that are fun to be in.\n\nGood luck with whatever you choose!\n\n_________________________\n\u201c", "answer": "D: shopping mall"}

{"text": "24\n\nThis lesson is designed to help you master simple arithmetic. There will be 10 problems in this lesson. Each problems will have 3 parts: one of the same type, a question and a solution. In this lesson you learn basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each problem has a corresponding picture to help you visualize the problem and determine the answer\n\n**This is a review of addition using basic addition principles; not multiplication or division**\n\nThis lesson is a review of addition with simple addition principles. It starts with an explanation of the \"addition principle\". This principle states that when you add, subtract or multiply, you need to subtract all the components except that part which belongs to the new addition, subtraction or multiplication. The two main components you need to subtract are the second component, that part which belongs to other part or both. The two main components that should not be added are that same part by number and the parts of numbers which is supposed to be multiplied. This is a logical rule that a child should learn very early on.\n\nA is for add, subtract, multiply.\nB is for addition, subtract, divide, sum or subtract.\n\nThe two parts of a number which can never be combined are subtracted from the added or subtracted part of the number. Addition, subtraction and multiplication can never be combined in any way. In addition, subtraction and multiplication, the two parts that can never be combined to make any number are not those number.\nC is for counter. Every number has a counter. The numbers 0 and 1 are counter numbers.\nThe two parts of number that are counter numbers are 0,00, 000 and 1,000.\nD is for double multiplication. Two numbers or two terms have the same value that can be doubled. For example, one is 1,000 and the other is 1,000,000. The value of 1,000,000 can be added to, subtracted from or multiplied with anything else. This kind of multiplication is called double multiplication.\nE is for exponents. Exponents can sometimes be in the form of whole numbers, in the form of fractions or in the form of symbols. You will learn more about exponents later in this lesson.\nF is for foreign numbers, fractions and decimals. Foreign numbers, fractions and decims may be numbers which are not in the US/Canada. The decimal place in any fraction is not between 0 and 1. In this", "answer": "A: smell smoke"}

The first time he picked the \u201ccool rabbit\u201d in the litter.  Every year after that he wanted the same \u201ccool rabbit\u2019.  One year John picked it as a birthday present only.  He ended up buying two of them but they got separated.  Finally John found the one that he liked.  He kept that for five years before he sold it.  Then the next year he bought the second one that he liked. Every year after that he kept the rabbit.  On Sunday morning after John had slept a few hours he found the rabbit dead in a nearby neighbor\u2019s flower bed.  Upon seeing the rabbit John was so depressed and scared he could barely speak or sleep.  His parents picked up and took him to the vet the same weekend they would have bought the rabbit.

When his dad explained how important it was to have one spoon he agreed to have one spoon.  John was very happy with the spatula until his dad left him with the three spoons.  The next day John started to cry because he couldn\u2019t use the three spoons. He cried even more the next day when he realized he needed both spoons for the day. After two more tries his dad gave him the spoon that had been used to cook his spaghetti last night.  It took the spoons until he could use both spoons in one meal.

{"text": "0\n\n### Answer: E\n\nIn the case of refrigerated items, meat lasts a long time in the refrigerator. The freshness factor of meat is directly proportional to the amount of cold air (or \u201cfragrance\u201d) in the refrigerator. Cold air causes rapid cooling of the entire refrigerator, so the temperature at the top of the refrigerator stays very close to the temperature of the ambient air above. The effect of refrigeration on meat storage is also related to the quality of meat, as many bacteria can survive on the surface of refrigerated food, while non-refrigerated food is less susceptible to this effect. Once the food is cooled to the proper temperature, the bacteria can survive only a short time in the refrigerator if exposed to very cold conditions.\n\nA refrigerator is typically airtight (with minimal openings in the doors), and will often have a glass panel separating the interior from the exterior (often made of tempered glass). This helps to block the entry of warm air and prevent the loss of oxygen. The glass panel also allows sunlight to penetrate the interior of the refrigerator, helping it maintain optimum refrigeration for a longer period. Therefore, the meat stored inside of a refrigerator will usually retain its freshness longer than if it were stored in a freezer (there is a much more significant difference in the quality of the meat being stored at the top of a freezer compared to at the bottom of a refrigerator), and there will be less risk of contamination. Meat is also less vulnerable to damage when stored in a freezer; for example, a frozen chicken will not cook as quickly as when stored in a refrigerator, so it is more susceptible to damage by bacteria in the food\u2019s condiments/sauce, and by moisture being trapped between the food and the container in the freezer.\n\nThere are, however, several major differences between freezing and refrigerating that can significantly affect the quality and shelf life of meat. First, freezing takes longer (more than 24 hours), meaning food products have to be stored and shipped for longer than the same food product can be cooled before freezing. Second, some ice crystals (particularly in vegetables and fruits) can cause the interior of the freezer and food shelves to crack, causing the loss of moisture and possibly a reduction in freshness at the bottom of the freezer. Third, refrigerating foods (such as meat and salad) generally increases the temperature of the food to the freezing point, rather than lowering the temperature after which the meat or fruit will not maintain the same quality", "answer": "E: freezer"}

To value $400 more than $100, you would need to subtract $200 from your original $100 bill.

He has 3 hours each day to complete the book, and for an extra $35, he can upgrade the computer's screen to a 13 foot screen. If he completes the book by July 1, he'll earn $160. On July 5, he can return the computer for any reason. If he completes the computer by July 10, he can trade it for a tablet computer that's a 9 foot wide screen. He'll earn $120. On July 12, he can upgrade the tablet's screen to a 16 foot wide screen. He will earn $180. On July 15, the tablet will require a subscription plan to continue and earn $160. On August 1, the tablet phone will no longer work. He can sell the tablet and recoup part of his $200 expense. If he completes the tablet by August 3, he can trade it in for a smartphone that's a 13 foot wide screen. He returns the smartphone by August 7. He earns $100 for this job, including the $35 to upgrade the screen. If he completes it by August 13, he'll receive the extra $10 to add to his weekly allowance.\n\nQuestion 9.1.1 Explanation The boy has 3 hours each day each day to complete a book. He has decided to upgrade his computer's screen to a full screen so that he can work on his new book on the computer at the same time. Therefore, he purchases a 13 foot wide LCD monitor for $280 (his hourly allowance of $35 and his savings of $65 will total $170). He has to trade this in by August 7 in order to trade in his iPad (14 foot wide) which he purchased for $300 at Walmart. In order to make this trade, he first needs to save $100 which will not be possible if he completes his book in 3 hours.\n\nQuestion 9, 1,2,3 Explanation\n\nAssigned by:\n\nTutorials, Tips, and TechniquesThe tutorials, tips, and techniques at ECON101.com are for your information and reference only.

{"text": "12\n\nInput:  At first, a man in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie  is walking the streets of Miami.  As he walks a row of pedestrians, he smiles and greets them.  When he is completely exhausted, he stops and rests for a while.  As he tries to catch his breath, his hand accidentally touches  an old man's coat and falls into a coma.  The man wakes up, but the city is filled with shadows.  When the shadow fades away, a man with a baseball hat and an  oversized jacket walks into the city.  He smiles as he passes a police station.  He walks around downtown and passes more buildings.  The shadow grows and now takes up almost the entire view of the buildings.  As the shadow continues to grow, it gets in the way of pedestrians' cars, so many people start running into the path of the shadow.  Just as they start to run into the path, the man walks closer to them.  This time, his body starts to move and the pedestrians move further in the way.  A black shadow appears all around the man and a huge storm begins to form, but the man begins to walk into it like an air traffic controller.   Eventually, he gets close enough to the street to where a taxi can be seen.  As he gets closer to the taxi, the road becomes narrower and narrow so cars can barely fit in.  The shadow continues to grow, but the man moves out of traffic and walks among pedestrians.  Eventually the road opens up again so people can get out of their cars and continue walking along the sidewalk. Eventually, another man appears and the two men walk hand in hand through a beautiful autumn day in Miami.  The cars can see the shadows of both men, but the man with the baseball cap continues to walk.  Soon, there is nothing on the floor but a few leaves with the word \"CAD\" written on them.  The shadow dissipates and cars are no longer visible.  As the man from before comes past, the first man appears from behind him.  The shadow of that man follows him to follow him to where the taxi is parked.  After he walks into the taxi, the man from before is seen walking by a group of tourists.  The shadow continues on and suddenly, a woman walking past sees the man.\n\nInput: What is the smallest number that can fit on the inside of one of the following five cylinders?

He's confused because elephants do not live with each other in the wild.    He decides to do a few extra chores and go to visit a different elephant.    This will make him feel more comfortable with the elephant, who will be able to communicate with him on his behalf.    It doesn't take long for the Elephant to learn that the other elephant is not a threat; he's only worried about the baby, which is fine by the elephant.    After a few minutes in the open, the elephant learns something unexpected: If the other elephant gets too close it can hurt its calf, and if he doesn't touch the calf a few times it will not grow.

There are also some problems which state that multiple choice answers are the key to a good grade. I am not trying to discourage you from making multiple choice answers a part of the problem since they can be very useful.

{"text": "2\n\nInput:The average cost of a car in California in 2002 was $22,832.  The average cost of a car was $21,721 in 2001.  The average price difference between 2002 and 2001 was $13,844.  The average car sales price in 2002 was $19,950.  The average price of a car in 2001 was $17,000.  The 2001 car sales price was higher because cars were more expensive than they were in 2001.  2000 saw fewer cars sold, resulting in more expensive cars.  1999 saw the most expensive cars in U.S. history.  1998 saw the least expensive cars in U. S. history.  The average cost was $12,957 in 1999.  In 1998 the car price increased by $7,743 so $15,000 was the average price.  1997 saw the smallest increase.  This year more cars will be sold.  Since 1998 cars are more expensive in general, you will see the total increase in the auto cost per year be the same.  1997 car sales of 9.1 million cars cost the government $36 billion. 1998 car sales of 10.6 million vehicles cost the government $47 billion. 1999 car sales of 11 million vehicles cost the government roughly $50 billion. 2000 car sales of 12.7 million vehicles cost the government around $55 billion.  2001 car sales of 13.9 million vehicles cost the government another $55 billion.  2002 car sales of 13.6 million vehicles cost not only $55 billion but also $69 billion in interest.  The car cost will only go up if you keep driving.  Since they are more expensive to buy, you will have to drive longer to get the car loan.  If your credit is too poor to make a car loan, you will need $1,832 to get the car.  The car loan cost will be higher for higher credit.\n\nClick on the \"Other\" tab above to solve the problem.", "answer": "E: might dream"}

To answer the multiple choice question, give the following answer:\nOutput:44\n\nInput:On Wednesday April 7th all the kids in the class started doing the Math Lesson. The teacher went over the lesson plan three times.  Each of the students had two minutes to finish answering the questions.  The teacher asked each student to give two different answers.  Each time a student answered the questions they were told to change the answer to the next question.  The student that was given the least amount of time was given five extra minutes of time to complete the rest of the lessons. The student that was given less than ten minutes to complete the lesson was given five extra minutes to work on their homework.  What would be the percentage of students who were given less than ten minutes?\n### Explanation:\nEvery week (except the few days when the teacher had to go to another event), the teacher goes over the questions with the students one more time. The teacher tells students that they are going to have two minutes to come up with as many different answers as possible and then the next teacher will let each of them know how many questions they answered correctly. That way if there are multiple correct answers the teacher can be sure that she will have all the correct ones. The extra five minutes means the teachers have time to talk to the students about their answers. So they don't just have to look at the answer and give it. They have time to talk about their reasoning for taking the answer. She may say \"You would prefer to get the question wrong. It could be that you don't think this is a problem or you don't think you know enough math. Or it could be that you don\u2019t need to see more than one answer to get it right.  Either way is ok. Then the student will have the time to think about why they would rather answer the question wrong. Then the student may choose an answer and write it down with their responses.\nStudents in the class are not always the same so the teacher can\u2019t read each student's mind while they are answering the questions. Since the teachers can\u2019t listen to all students at one time, she can read more than one answer.\n\nInput:The problem: If a group of 2 people do a math problem in a 5 minute period, the number of times they can get that group to work on", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

{"text": "Unusual\n\nThis is an example of how to use positive reinforcement (i.e. using money) to reward a child's actions. It's important to not overdo it, though. For example, when I was a kid, my parents would give us little tokens and I would spend the money in my mother's purse when the money ran out and they'd buy us new clothes and toys. That's a negative reinforcement that encourages you to save your money. Instead, if you let your child help you pick out what he wants, that's positive reinforcement. When the allowance is a big bonus, your child feels like his behavior is valuable and special. If your child is helping other chores, tell him how great his help is when he helps you pick everything out for the rest of the week. You give him more money if he helps you instead of getting extra money for helping.\n\nWe recently used this sort of \"compassionate\" money to reward Caleb for helping the kids put groceries in the car and loading the car. I gave him a $5 and a $5 in return for taking food to the homeless man. Here's the logic: he'd have been out of pocket for his car insurance if his mother wouldn't have paid for it to begin with and she did help out by paying for it. Also, Caleb can help me by doing another chore for free like unloading his car of groceries or putting away his toys, when he takes his money. I let him do this a couple of times before he finally got the idea that it was okay to get money to help my mom out. He thinks it's funny seeing the money go down the drain, but I also think it encourages him and teaches him to be more altruistic. Plus, his parents got to see how their son was trying to help.\n\nSo, how did you do with this exercise? Were you able to use the \"compassionate\" or \"kind\" money, to reward your child's behavior? How did you implement these strategies successfully? Please leave your answers HERE below, (just be polite).\n\nComments\n\nWe just discovered this game (from another author) and it is very fun. It's really just as simple as a typical reward card in that kids can earn money to keep in their pocket. However, you can tailor it to your child's personality. For example, you can have him earn his own allowance for things like brushing his teeth, eating his vegetables, not littering, listening to", "answer": "D: kind"}

The next time Zach rode over another sharp rock, Mary asked him to stop riding.  Zach responded, \"Okay.\"  When Zach was not riding over sharp rocks anymore, Mary asked him if he still wanted to ride over the sharp rocks.  The next time Zach rode, Mary asked him to ride over the sharp rock again and he did.  Since Zach continued to not ride over the sharp rocks, Mary got worried.  The following Monday Zach was telling Mary that he had not been seeing her lately.  Zach said that he was going to try to change his habits.  Instead of saying that his bad habits made him not see her, Zach said that he could not see her because his bad habits made him see all of the dirt and the rocks.  Mary asked Zach what he thought about his habits and he responded saying that he did not want to see dirt and the stones too.  Zach said that if he wanted to see dirt and stones then he would have to go in the back.  The next time that Zach rode over a sharp corner, Mary asked again if he wanted to ride over the stones.  When Zach was riding over the stones, Mary stood up from the riding seat and asked him if he wanted to ride on the rocks as well.  When Zach was driving over the rocks, Mary gave him another piece of advice.  She told him that he should start riding on the rocks less because his car had broken down four times. He then suggested she should stop giving him her advice so he would not get stuck on the rocks for so long.  Zach continued to ride over the rocks and on Tuesady he went outside of his neighborhood and mowed his neighbor's lawn.  On Sunday Zach stopped and talked to the neighbor and said that he should do the lawn because it took his mind off of the dirt and the stones.  The neighbor said that he did not want Zach to do the lawn so Zach said that he would do the grass because it made him happy to mow the grass", "answer": "A: sail boats"}

You've got me thinking: who are my friends?  Who does everyone expect me to call and who should I invite to my home?  If it makes you feel better, I'll go play hockey with a friend who lives right across the city.\"  Mary exclaims that \"That sounds so fun!\"  Sam tells Mary that he'll be in touch tomorrow: \"By tomorrow night!\"\n\nInput:Bob is about to get into his car to get into work when he is startled by a loud crash outside.

Choices:  A: stress B: nervousness C: smile D: being bored E: making new friends<n>Output:		 13<n><n>#: #: #: #:<n>### Example Answer (Answer the following multiple choice questions before choosing the correct answer from above):<n>*In this example, Zach receives an extra $10 for mowing the lawn than his neighbor will pay him.  He will also receive an additional $40 that day if the neighbor does not pay him this Friday.  With his savings, he will only need to earn $60 to afford the new bike.  However, if Mary works in restaurants and earns an additional $75 per week, Zach needs only $50 to afford the new bicycle.  Both the neighbor and Zach earn too much for Zach to pay for Mary.<n>*Mary is both aloof and self-importance.  Since her experience with meeting people can be stressful, she would have no problem finding somebody to babysit for her for 2 hours on Saturday.  Zach can hire a babysitter for only $7 per hour even though Zach earns too much to afford Mary.  That is why if Zach did not know Mary, Zach would not have enough money to afford to babysit his own son alone for 2 hours on Saturday morning.<n>*Zach is stressed because he needs extra $80 before he can afford the new bicycle.<n>*Mary is nervous because her last experience with a stranger was stressful and made it difficult to find a babysitter for the weekend.

Zach was in charge of the dishes and John was preparing a cup of coffee.  John said "Well Mary, there are three cups in here, and one cup is left.  I'll go back and get the other two.  You can take the rest."  Mary went out to the porch while John stayed in the kitchen.  Mary was looking around the kitchen.  She saw a pot full of water and a bunch of dirty plates.  She said to Zach "John, why the heck don't you go and see if there are any dirty dishes on the counter?"  Zach picked up the mug of coffee.  He took a deep, long drag from the pipe and then turned and said to John  "We didn't have any coffee this morning and we needed to put the plates back in the sink.  You sure you can't just do that?"  John had a bit of a puzzled look on his face.  He picked up the coffee pot and went into the kitchen.  Mary thought back and remembered that Zach had emptied some dirty dishes in the sink one morning.  She saw him pouring the mug filled with coffee into the water.  She thought, "Wow, that boy's crazy."  Zach went back upstairs and got up, got dressed and came down to help.  Zach went into the living room, made some coffee and then went down to see what his neighbor John had done.  Mary, without thinking, said to him "John, didn't you do that one morning and I told you to empty the pot?"  Zach shook his head.  He said, "No.  We never do anything like that every morning.  Today I did a new trick.  It works great."<n>Input: Why was Mary shocked when Zach told her that he was not going to do dishes again?<n>Output: 6

He asks for $100 to buy a new bicycle, in exchange for a percentage of the bicycle when it is sold.<n>The old man is very impressed with the offer, and decides to loan the boy $100. He hands him the first $100 bill and asks him to return it when he has paid it back. But the old man is already in a mess, so he has to ask for a second $100 bill. This time, the old man gives the second $100 bill to the boy to pay him back. He does so and the boy returns the money.<n>The boy is overwhelmed with the huge amount of money that has come his way. He has given $100 to the old man and now has over $200 in his hands. But, he does not know what to do with it. He has not paid off his loans, but has an even higher debt than he was before he asked for the money. He could lend the money to the farmer, who needs the money badly. The farmer has $200, because the bank offered him the same rate. And he still needs to put money into his business. The boy thinks it is too much money and just wants to go home. But, his father is also waiting on him. He tells him to get rid of what he does not need. He wants the money to buy things for his father.<n>The boy gets upset with his father because he had asked the old man to lend him $100 and then has gone and found $200.

Have fun and let the questions roll. Remember, your students will love you if you can get them to solve these puzzles:) Let me know what you guys get.<n><n>Wednesday, January 8, 2014<n><n>One of my favorite things is when my students come up to me after a lesson and say, "You made that question really hard. Thank you!" This was a question that many students were struggling with after a recent math lesson. Many of my students struggle more with problem solving strategies (like identifying key terms and how to evaluate the answer to a question) than they do with reading comprehension strategies (like spelling out concepts and using a dictionary to find key vocabulary words).<n><n>This is something I really want to work on now that I have a solid understanding of how to build readers, but I also struggle with identifying key words in order to find key words in the text as well as with evaluating the validity of a given answer. This can all be used to build readers. This week, I was challenged to work on developing a reader's comprehension strategy that helps me figure out what the student is looking for when they read a passage that I'm teaching them (for instance, my second graders were studying for a standardized test in social studies this week). The first step is to establish a baseline for what the student can already figure out and what they need to do in order to be able to figure out what an author did or why the author did it. Many students struggle because they think the author did something odd or was unclear about something. I have to remind myself of what I already know by first asking the student something like, "Based on what you understand of the passage, what does this passage say in regards to...", "Are you confused about the author's intentions?", "Why have you found this passage confusing?", "What are you struggling with?" or "How can I help you better understand the passage?"<n><n>Then I can ask another question like, "What is the purpose of this passage?" Once I've been able to get a student's thoughts on

They were joined by a group of three moms and the father of one of their children.  The father suggested they should all get together and do something fun together.  The mother agreed to the suggestion, but she said, "We could do that thing where we take turns."  The other two women disagreed.  One said, "No.  I don't want to do that thing where we all get together and do that thing where we're all together.  That way will just make it look like we're all doing something together."<n>Output: B<n>[Correct Answer: C]<n><n>Input: A group of adults met at the park to play kick ball and soccer.  The mother of one of the campers wanted to bring snacks.  She asked the campers of if they all wanted to grab a snack as well.  Everyone said yes and each took out a few small packs of snacks and put them in a big bag.  They set the snack bag down and went in to play a game of kickball.  After 45 minutes, the mom said, "We've got a snack, but have you decided what we're going to do with it?"  Everyone said yes and gave the mom their snack.  Then, the other two mothers asked the first mother what she'd planned to do with the snack once she had all the kids involved.  She told them how they were all going to get in the house without their clothes on and start playing some video games while the mom dressed up again.  When the mom dressed up and told the other 2 women they were all still going to play kickball.  One of the women replied, "Is there a point to this?  Why don't you just play kickball and be done with it?  The soccer's over!"  When the mother told the woman, "I'm not dressing up yet," she quickly replied "We can keep doing that game!"  When the other mother asked if the first mother realized they were all just playing "video games and being naked" until they were done, the second mother said, "I'm dressed.  I'm even making a cupcake cake."  The second mother was right, they were playing "video games and be naked" until they were all done. [Correct Answer: C]

Megan will be the seamstress that makes and repairs the pieces of fabric for the dress.  We will also need to buy her a large needle and thread.

When she's not working at the hospital, she's at school, where she is the captain of volleyball.  When she goes home, Anna plays dress up with her mom every afternoon.  There are two dresses Anna and Sarah wear at home.  They each have their own favorite and that dress is called Anna's Dress.  Anna often carries her older sister's dress on trips to the store, where it gets dirty.  One night, when Anna is playing dress up, she puts on Sarah's dress and it catches on fire.  Anna puts the dress on Sarah's arms and the fire dies down and they put it out.  Anna's mom takes the dress, takes it home and puts it away.  Sarah wears Anna's dress to play volleyball at home and Sarah doesn't even notice when it smells and wears it the next day.  When the fire breaks out again, Anna is the first to put it out.  She goes home, puts on her mother's dress and the fire dies down.  Anna is also the first to say "fire, fire, fire" and is the last to do anything about it.  If Anna says "fire, fire, Fire" then Sarah stops playing dress up and her mother won't be upset.  If Anna says, "fire, fire, FIRE" then Sara stops playing dress up and will be upset.  If Sarah gets upset, then Anna will have the fire covered by the end of the story and the fire will die down.<n><n>Solution: (There is another sentence in the passage<n>but it is not related to this passage.  Here is an important part of the<n>response.)<n><n>It is important that people know each others' feelings.  Most of the world does not like Sarah because she plays dress up too much.<n><n>Discussion:<n><n>What are Mary's and Zach's jobs?<n><n>Why does Anna have 7 older sisters?<n><n>What is an important thing each sister does that the other doesn't do?<n><n>What is the value of a good friend that is kind and helpful and will tell you the truth?  Should Anna's friend tell her the truth?

When I wrote this topic, they were not really friends. They only had a couple of days to see each other before their classes started. But, there is no such thing as friendship without first loving each other right? When I first told them about this topic, I didn't expect them to be able to answer this. There were even some topics that were really hard for them to explain like "how many" and the "letter writing" questions. But, even more difficult than those, was the "picture" topic. They all said how hard it is for them to tell someone that they love them. I couldn't tell how much I wanted to hug them because I just wanted to cry so badly. Now that I think about it, I didn't tell them this topic in jest like I meant to. They really believe what I said. I think part of their reason to write the journal was to share their happiness to finally have a better life after high school and college. Because they were really looking forward to seeing each other. They felt so happy that they couldn't believe their eyes. I know some parents who don't say more than "my child is good at school" when their kids finish their school chores. They simply don't say anything at all. They don't even give us time to talk about our school or how they are doing. Although they only see their children one or two days out of a week, they still don't seem to feel the need to talk to us about it. But the thought of how the kids are doing in school and how they are feeling

He later asked her how long she was sleeping over and she told him that she had not slept over with him at all.

The authorities put her back with her mother.  The goat gave birth in the woods.  The baby went to sleep, and when it woke up, the mother showed it by nursing it out of her.  The baby grew to about 4 feet tall and weighed about 250 pounds.  The neighbors were so jealous of the goats that they bought two.  They would often get into fights on lawnmowers and mowers in the summer.  One of the twins was a boy who got angry in the hot summer heat and stabbed a hole through the fence.  He was quickly apprehended and the other brother died from a broken leg.  The neighbors were heartbroken.  After they finished gardening, they would all sit down together late at night to watch the goats.  The next morning, they would be up before dawn and have their breakfast.  That afternoon, they would all sit on the porch and have their baths.  The goat loved to eat grass, so she spent her afternoons gnawing on her grass-encrusted horns.  At night, she would nurse the baby.  As each day passed, the neighbors' hatred grew.  One evening, the goats came to their front door and their neighbors started to go with them.  When they got outside, the goats jumped onto the porch and started to play on the steps.  When the neighbors tried to leave, all the goats jumped up onto their laps and waded down behind them and began to lick at them.  The neighbors watched as the goats nuzzled up against them and licked their faces.  Suddenly, the two neighbor goats began to cry.  They could not stand it anymore and

As the teacher enters the classroom he receives a stack of handouts on a table.  Alex picks out one of the handouts and uses it to show the class.  The handout has a photo of a building on either side of a red dotted line.  On the left side of the photo are four colored circles labeled “A, B, C, and D."  While Alex presents the handout, his teacher starts talking about the four building colors.  To Alex's surprise the teacher shows him the second handout which has colored letters on top of building names.  Alex writes the name of the building on a piece of paper and sticks it to the first handout.  Before he can read the name, his teacher pulls the paper from Alex's hand.  Instead of writing the name, she writes the word test in big letters with a capital T on it.  As Alex notices the mistake in his work he quickly grabs the next sheet of paper before the teacher is finished.  As Alex gets the paper back to the teacher, she tells him not to go back to the desk.  Instead, he goes to the front of the classroom to stand beside his teacher until she finishes talking about the test.  Alex begins to complain about the test but his teacher doesn't let him.  Alex says the test was boring and his teacher agrees.  The teacher explains that, unlike the other buildings, this one has a red dotted line on the top of it, so all directions are different.  Alex says it looked the same to him.  His teacher agrees.  Alex goes back to his desk and writes the word test on his new handout.  As he reads he realizes that the word test is on the bottom of the handout.  In addition, Alex has circled a name inside the test.  The teacher says that Alex wrote his name on the bottom of the test because he needed to see if he was correct.  Alex says no.  He writes "A" on the test.<n>Output: 5<n><n>Input:If Alex is writing his name on the bottom part of a paper where it has been written by someone else,  should he write on the bottom two parts of the paper or only one part?

I have never heard of this teacher...<n><n>I know the teacher who did the problem in a class I took last week, she teaches math and art to 4th grade students. I'm also taking a math and a different science next year with her. I'll let you know how it goes.<n><n>My sister is a math teacher too. She also does the problem in class. The kids like her for it because she is very approachable. She has a small class of around 25 students, which makes it easy for her to teach.<n><n>I haven't heard of a math class like that. Is it like the kind of thing a 6th grader is supposed to think about during a math class? I find it very hard to take a concept and to teach it that way. Would it be possible to design a course that covers the different aspects of math while they are still in preschool? Even 3 year old math students can make sense of those concepts. We tried this with my older brother about 6 years ago - he is now in high school. The first thing they were taught were arithmetic and algebra. We started out with simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, multiplication by 2's, division by 3's, multiplying by 4's...basically adding and subtracting on our own in order to have an understanding of what those numbers really mean.<n><n>I haven`t heard of a math class that covers fractions the way 5th graders would do in the real world. I`ll have to ask my sister if her class uses this sort of thing. She only teaches 7th and 8th grade. I know of one math class for kindergartners, but she is not a kindergarten teacher.<n><n>I`ma trying the class. She is trying it today. I`ve done some of the problems over the last three days and they have never seemed too hard. They still are to me. I should be able to pull this off. I`ll leave a comment here if I succeed. I`m a little rusty on the problem but I can`t wait to see how it goes either!

The input and output were not clear enough. I think that the question was too simple. Some of the choices were unclear to me. I wish it allowed for additional ways to answer.<n><n>Feedback:I think you could have added a third answer. For example, say Zach earns 15 dollars a week, it would say that he earns $6 on Saturday in addition to the $65 that he currently saves. The teacher could read that as $16 total for the week.<n><n>Feedback:(1) The grade calculator is more difficult than it should be. The answer text on a single line does not present the idea in a clear and consistent manner. Although the grade calculator is very helpful, it could be greatly improved.(2) It seems like Zach could have earned an additional dollar on Friday or received it on Saturday. One option from the teacher suggested doing both on the same day. Perhaps you could have a different prompt with three or more answers.

Choices:  A: leg B: garment C: torso D: body E: road<n>Output:		 A<n><n>#### Example:Assume that Zach earns $10 per hour mowing the lawn. He'll receive a total of $100 for the week. Assume that his neighbor will pay Zach $7 per hour for the 2 hours he is scheduled to babysit this Saturday. If Zach earns $35 per hour, how many hours will Zach need to babysit this Saturday before he can buy his bike?<n>Output: 8<n><n>Input:A: Zach is saving his change in order to buy the new bike on Friday. He has $55 in his savings account for the purchase. If Zac earns $7 per hour, this $70 will net him a total of $125. Therefore, on Friday, he has $55 in his account plus $70 from Zac. Therefore, Zach needs to earn $90 + $70 plus $55 = $110 to pay for Zac's bike. What should he do with her saved up money?<n>Output: 2<n><n>Input:A man buys $100 worth of goods from his local store with his store credit card. He then pays $50 out of his pay at the store with the store credit card. If he had to pay each item with a check, he would still use the store credit card. To use the check would reduce the value of his store credit card. However, he also has an additional $20 in his savings account. So his total for the two purchases is $190. If Zac earns $8 per hour, then a $50 expense would net him $180. Would this purchase be paid for using credit if Zac did not work at the store?<n>Output: 8

He has saved up $65.20 and received his allowances this week. Zach will be working two jobs this summer on top of the two hours he mows the lawn and babysits. At the end of July, Zach will save up an extra $80 and then he will buy the bike.<n><n>Input: If Zach is a model, he receives 40 stickers.  His parents give 75 percent of his allowance to his allowance each week and the rest is spent paying bills for the family.  For a full-time worker he should have a minimum of $200 in savings.  He is saving $100.15 and should be able to pay bills of $100+ with the $20 in allowance.

You're sure you need it right? Do you really know what you should buy? This is the time that your brain should be working for you right? Well, it isn't working for you and that is the problem. Stop and ask yourself some hard questions. If $20 isn't an option, that doesn't mean that you should buy things, you're simply not ready to buy things yet. You have to get smarter, you have to start doing your own homework, and you have to stop trying to be everything to everyone. This isn't normal, your mother-in-law gave you a car, I have a car, and the girl at the mall who said she needs a laptop. You know what? I didn't even need that computer; I did it right in front of her and didn't need it. The computer is the problem the computer is the problem. We should be saving money to pay for college, and we're just going out and buying things right now! The problem is you want something that's not realistic and that will keep getting the best of you because you have a huge ego. I don't mean big ego, I mean the ego that thinks it's better than everyone else. You can tell when a grown man is insecure, but you can't tell when he is not insecure. You can tell when he's being insecure when he starts to use all the money he has at the grocery store. Stop trying to be the center of attention by buying stuff all the time, put it all out on the line and make a real decision, if you make the wrong choice you will be sorry you made it, and that's what really matters. Do not buy anything to please mommy, or your father, or your mother-in- law. Look what you are doing now, you are using the money you have earned to pay for a computer for some stupid girl. The best of luck to you and good luck on your decision!<n><n>The material on this website is provided for educational purposes only and is not to be used for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, or in place of therapy or medical care.

I'm very interested in your responses! Thank you so much!<n><n>You're welcome!I did notice a typo or two in the answer when I first posted the text! I was going to change the answer after reading back the post, but after seeing that I don't really want to change anything, so I'm just going to go ahead and leave it there.<n><n>Your right, "there is a big crowd" and "the crowd isn't that big." You would have made a bigger crowd.<n><n>My guess would be "the crowd isn't big," instead of just a big crowd.<n><n>The part "field" really gets me. In the word "field" you say "there is a big one." Then in the answer "field test" you say "there isn't a one in a million crowd." I suppose this is a bit like how when your grandpa says "not a lot of people" he means "not a lot of the people who are around."<n><n>Your right, kiddos! In the word "field test" you ask "there isn't a in a million crowd." Then in the answer you say "there isn’t a one in a million audience," which sounds funny to me. There wasn’t a "lonely crowd." However, if your group was lonely, I would have changed that part of the answer to "...there was a small group of about ten or so."<n><n>Your right kiddo about the "field." As I was writing it I kept saying "there isn't a big one." My grandpa would definitely say "not that big."<n><n>Well kiddo, the only right answer is answer 1 (not that I agree with you and the grammatical errors you mention). I agree with you I would change field to "there is a big group." The answer is answer one.<n><n>No, it must be the small one as the answer is, "There isn't a one in million!"<n>You didn't read my question right... it is a field test, where YOU have to pick a team and go to the "field."<n><n>There

Maybe try this activity in person for feedback and also because it can be fun. Write down some ideas with pictures (you can also print it out if it's too difficult). I think some sort of "reading" activity might be nice as well, such as a journal. Or you can just write something you'd do in person.<n>(Remember, no judgement, just suggestions)<n><n>For example:<n><n>This is how it works in a real world store:<n><n>An employee rings you up after asking how much you want to spend<n><n>You write down your price on a sticker on the bag with your receipt and your name<n><n>When you see the bag and receipt you pay on the sticker on the receipt<n><n>When you walk out with a price tag, you hand to the manager and she stamps your receipt<n><n>You walk out with your receipt and sticker<n><n>On the way down, check for any discounts that you could've gotten. You still get everything but maybe you get a discount on one thing. Or maybe you get a couple things for free if you tell the cashier they're the right size.<n><n>But that's just my ideas. Just get the idea rolling.<n><n>There are literally millions of ways to spend the extra $5!<n><n>Hope everyone is having a great day!<n><n>Hugs~<n><n>_________________________<n>What is it really like in hell?<n><n>Hello there, I’m new to the forum, but I just wanted to say that I think this post is funny. The idea is great, and I like it.<n>As I’ve seen a few people suggest, use some sort of an art project to express your points. I see this working well with some sort of board game or puzzle.<n><n>And you may want to check out a movie theater in your neighborhood, or perhaps even a movie theater in a suburb of it. They tend to be pretty affordable, and often have tickets for sale and sometimes they have something like “movies in the park” that are fun to be in.<n><n>Good luck with whatever you choose!<n><n>_________________________<n>“

There will be 10 problems in this lesson. Each problems will have 3 parts: one of the same type, a question and a solution. In this lesson you learn basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each problem has a corresponding picture to help you visualize the problem and determine the answer<n><n>**This is a review of addition using basic addition principles; not multiplication or division**<n><n>This lesson is a review of addition with simple addition principles. It starts with an explanation of the "addition principle". This principle states that when you add, subtract or multiply, you need to subtract all the components except that part which belongs to the new addition, subtraction or multiplication. The two main components you need to subtract are the second component, that part which belongs to other part or both. The two main components that should not be added are that same part by number and the parts of numbers which is supposed to be multiplied. This is a logical rule that a child should learn very early on.<n><n>A is for add, subtract, multiply.<n>B is for addition, subtract, divide, sum or subtract.<n><n>The two parts of a number which can never be combined are subtracted from the added or subtracted part of the number. Addition, subtraction and multiplication can never be combined in any way. In addition, subtraction and multiplication, the two parts that can never be combined to make any number are not those number.<n>C is for counter. Every number has a counter. The numbers 0 and 1 are counter numbers.<n>The two parts of number that are counter numbers are 0,00, 000 and 1,000.<n>D is for double multiplication. Two numbers or two terms have the same value that can be doubled. For example, one is 1,000 and the other is 1,000,000. The value of 1,000,000 can be added to, subtracted from or multiplied with anything else. This kind of multiplication is called double multiplication.<n>E is for exponents. Exponents can sometimes be in the form of whole numbers, in the form of fractions or in the form of symbols. You will learn more about exponents later in this lesson.<n>F is for foreign numbers, fractions and decimals. Foreign numbers, fractions and decims may be numbers which are not in the US/Canada. The decimal place in any fraction is not between 0 and 1. In this

I'm just going to keep repeating this as you didn't answer it. How the hell would you earn 50% of the paper that you didn't even have to read? The amount you wrote out isn't even that much at all.<n><n>3. You answered the question before answering the question with something that makes you seem like you don't give a f, especially since the final answer was "20%" on the first, and then 20% on the second, and then 80% on the third, and 80% on the fourth, and then your 5% on the fifth - 80% on each one.<n><n>4. There is NO WAY that getting a part time job is "a great way to earn coins." You're asking for an 80% raise, which isn't possible, especially since your hours are at school instead of at a restaurant. If you want to earn coins, why don't you just buy the coins and sell them later? There is no way in hell the majority on this page can believe that is in any ways a good idea, although I do realize that it's just a paper.

John then ran home to call for his parents.  James and his mother ran home as well.  They got into their car and started to drive up to the police station.  The police were having trouble communicating with each other so they just waited at the station until the other police got their act together (which didn't take long at all).  But as they arrived at the station, the police car was hit by two other police cars.  Then the police car that James saw crash into Mr. Brown's car had its back end knocked off onto the street by the car that James had hit.  As the police were having trouble communicating and couldn't immediately respond to events as they happened, many of them were killed.  How did that affect the way they did their job?<n>Output: 9<n><n>Input:John and Andrew were walking home from school when Mr. R pulled out a gun and fired a shot into the air.  Then Mr. Black jumped up and shoved Mr. R through the air until Mr. R landed on the ground.  Then Mr. White walked over and hit Mr. R again with his cane.  Then both boys hit Mr. R from behind with their canes.  Then Mr. J. tried to run over to help, but Mr. R pulled out the can and hit him with it.  Mr. M tried to get Mr. R's legs loose so he could hit him once more.  Then Mr. D tried to block the three boys from hitting him again but the boys couldn't let go of a leg and ran off.  Two more police cars arrived at the scene, so the boys had to go to the hospital.  What did they do at the hospital? output: 3<n><n>Output:  A: Mr. K was on his way to the station.  He was wearing his uniform and he was carrying a clipboard.  He took the time to get some information out of the officers before they went inside to the police station to check their reports.  He then walked over to the police car.  He asked the officer if they knew where Mr. James and his mother had been and then asked the officer for his phone number.

Choices:  A: backery B: ham sandwich C: fridge D: butcher shop E: freezer<n>Output:		 0<n><n>### Answer: E<n><n>In the case of refrigerated items, meat lasts a long time in the refrigerator. The freshness factor of meat is directly proportional to the amount of cold air (or “fragrance”) in the refrigerator. Cold air causes rapid cooling of the entire refrigerator, so the temperature at the top of the refrigerator stays very close to the temperature of the ambient air above. The effect of refrigeration on meat storage is also related to the quality of meat, as many bacteria can survive on the surface of refrigerated food, while non-refrigerated food is less susceptible to this effect. Once the food is cooled to the proper temperature, the bacteria can survive only a short time in the refrigerator if exposed to very cold conditions.<n><n>A refrigerator is typically airtight (with minimal openings in the doors), and will often have a glass panel separating the interior from the exterior (often made of tempered glass). This helps to block the entry of warm air and prevent the loss of oxygen. The glass panel also allows sunlight to penetrate the interior of the refrigerator, helping it maintain optimum refrigeration for a longer period. Therefore, the meat stored inside of a refrigerator will usually retain its freshness longer than if it were stored in a freezer (there is a much more significant difference in the quality of the meat being stored at the top of a freezer compared to at the bottom of a refrigerator), and there will be less risk of contamination. Meat is also less vulnerable to damage when stored in a freezer; for example, a frozen chicken will not cook as quickly as when stored in a refrigerator, so it is more susceptible to damage by bacteria in the food’s condiments/sauce, and by moisture being trapped between the food and the container in the freezer.<n><n>There are, however, several major differences between freezing and refrigerating that can significantly affect the quality and shelf life of meat. First, freezing takes longer (more than 24 hours), meaning food products have to be stored and shipped for longer than the same food product can be cooled before freezing. Second, some ice crystals (particularly in vegetables and fruits) can cause the interior of the freezer and food shelves to crack, causing the loss of moisture and possibly a reduction in freshness at the bottom of the freezer. Third, refrigerating foods (such as meat and salad) generally increases the temperature of the food to the freezing point, rather than lowering the temperature after which the meat or fruit will not maintain the same quality

The bill was originally printed with $50 on it and $75 was printed on the bill, therefore, the bill has an approximate face value of $75.  Now, the bill is worth $400.  What is the correct amount that the original bill should have been worth?<n>Output:  A $200 bill has a face value $400.  To value $400 more than $100, you would need to subtract $200 from your original $100 bill.  This is because $100 was originally printed with an extra $50 on it and to more accurately value $300 you would need to subtract the $50 from $100.

So the answer would have been B, for 'hot country'. However, in today's lesson, we are looking at an object that we already have inside of us (namely, our wallet). So, we need to be able to tell whether or not something is still inside of us. It would have been useful to know this beforehand (namely, before the student was given the choice to answer). We've developed some pretty good logic skills here, so now that we know the question, we can apply this well into our real world.

He has 3 hours each day to complete the book, and for an extra $35, he can upgrade the computer's screen to a 13 foot screen. If he completes the book by July 1, he'll earn $160. On July 5, he can return the computer for any reason. If he completes the computer by July 10, he can trade it for a tablet computer that's a 9 foot wide screen. He'll earn $120. On July 12, he can upgrade the tablet's screen to a 16 foot wide screen. He will earn $180. On July 15, the tablet will require a subscription plan to continue and earn $160. On August 1, the tablet phone will no longer work. He can sell the tablet and recoup part of his $200 expense. If he completes the tablet by August 3, he can trade it in for a smartphone that's a 13 foot wide screen. He returns the smartphone by August 7. He earns $100 for this job, including the $35 to upgrade the screen. If he completes it by August 13, he'll receive the extra $10 to add to his weekly allowance.<n><n>Question 9.1.1 Explanation The boy has 3 hours each day each day to complete a book. He has decided to upgrade his computer's screen to a full screen so that he can work on his new book on the computer at the same time. Therefore, he purchases a 13 foot wide LCD monitor for $280 (his hourly allowance of $35 and his savings of $65 will total $170). He has to trade this in by August 7 in order to trade in his iPad (14 foot wide) which he purchased for $300 at Walmart. In order to make this trade, he first needs to save $100 which will not be possible if he completes his book in 3 hours.<n><n>Question 9, 1,2,3 Explanation<n><n>Assigned by:<n><n>Tutorials, Tips, and TechniquesThe tutorials, tips, and techniques at ECON101.com are for your information and reference only.

The sale is over.  Mary walks out of the store.  Before leaving the store the sales clerk makes a remark about Mary picking out that sweater.  Mary thinks it was rude to say something like that.  Mary doesn't understand why she said that.  Mary is mad and madder when she finds out who said those words but she doesn't understand what the clerk was trying to say.  Mary tells the clerk that she has no idea what he was trying to say. The clerk tells Mary to leave the store.  Mary goes back in and the clerk tells her to leave the store again.  Mary wants nothing to do with this store.  The clerk tells her that she only has 4 dollars left.  Mary feels so sorry for the clerk.  Mary was upset because she didn't know what he was trying to tell her but the clerk is even worse off.  Mary says that he has caused her no problem in the past.  The clerk tells Mary that he wants to go back into his office and tell Mary who said he was rude by telling her she picked out that sweater.  The clerk leaves but Mary is still upset.  Mary knows it was her mother who said the words the clerk had just told her.  Mary thinks it's unfair for the clerk to put his feelings in front of the sales clerk's feelings.  Mary is mad but she doesn't think he deserves to go back because Mary is right.  Mary thinks it will be more fair if the clerk just takes Mary's $4 that she has left in his purse.

As he walks a row of pedestrians, he smiles and greets them.  When he is completely exhausted, he stops and rests for a while.  As he tries to catch his breath, his hand accidentally touches  an old man's coat and falls into a coma.  The man wakes up, but the city is filled with shadows.  When the shadow fades away, a man with a baseball hat and an  oversized jacket walks into the city.  He smiles as he passes a police station.  He walks around downtown and passes more buildings.  The shadow grows and now takes up almost the entire view of the buildings.  As the shadow continues to grow, it gets in the way of pedestrians' cars, so many people start running into the path of the shadow.  Just as they start to run into the path, the man walks closer to them.  This time, his body starts to move and the pedestrians move further in the way.  A black shadow appears all around the man and a huge storm begins to form, but the man begins to walk into it like an air traffic controller.   Eventually, he gets close enough to the street to where a taxi can be seen.  As he gets closer to the taxi, the road becomes narrower and narrow so cars can barely fit in.  The shadow continues to grow, but the man moves out of traffic and walks among pedestrians.  Eventually the road opens up again so people can get out of their cars and continue walking along the sidewalk. Eventually, another man appears and the two men walk hand in hand through a beautiful autumn day in Miami.  The cars can see the shadows of both men, but the man with the baseball cap continues to walk.  Soon, there is nothing on the floor but a few leaves with the word "CAD" written on them.  The shadow dissipates and cars are no longer visible.  As the man from before comes past, the first man appears from behind him.  The shadow of that man follows him to follow him to where the taxi is parked.  After he walks into the taxi, the man from before is seen walking by a group of tourists.  The shadow continues on and suddenly, a woman walking past sees the man.<n><n>Input: What is the smallest number that can fit on the inside of one of the following five cylinders? Output:

If each child eats a dollar-for-$1 meal, how much money is that?<n>Output: $25,000,000<n><n>Input:Jack and Susan are both willing to spend $1000 for their first house.  Jack thinks he can get a nice house for $2000.  Susan is more optimistic about the market prices of their area. What advice do you think Jack should give Susan before he purchases the house?<n>Output: 10,000,000<n>Now, if the average home price is $300,000 and you're paying $5000 to rent a house, that means $9,000/month to buy the house. So if you can only afford a $1000 house, you'd need $90,000. If the average home price is 100,000, you'd need $30,000. If it's 400,000, you'd have to pay $1,000,000.<n>Output: 1,000,000<n>Output: 10,726,000<n><n>Input.

What does Jack need to earn $10?<n>Output: 10<n>Output: Jack is babysitting for 2 hours.  He plans on spending $90 on his bill, so $70 will go to the babysitting.  He's spending $60 on groceries.  He'll need $75 for the week to buy clothes, clothes for the babysitter, and a $5 grocery card.  He'll need the $5 to buy 3 pairs of shoes when the babysitter returns from the store on Friday.

Zach’s mother buys him three large stickers for $10 each. Zach's mother sends Zach a letter telling him she will pay $10 per week if he mows all 6 of his neighbor’s lawns. A $4 gas payment and a $10 water payment are sent to Zach's mother.  Zach's neighbor is paying Zach $6 per hour to mow their lawn. All of Zach's checks are received, he receives his gas payment on Monday in the mail but his water payment wasn't received. On Tuesday his parents send Zach another $10 allowance to pay the landlord $50 for water. Zach sends a letter to his parents thanking his father for his generosity to Zach and asks them to pay $60 for gas.  Zach's mother sends Zach another $15 allowance to pay his electric bill. Zach's father sends Zach an email asking Zach if he would like to babysit his son for $7 an hour on Saturday after he mows their lawn. Zach decides he would like the job and brings his check to his parents' house later that evening for a signing ceremony for his job. His parents tell Zach that they are very grateful that Zach has decided to babysit and will now be saving money to pay for his bike. Zach is happy to babysit, and is excited to earn extra money to pay for his new bike. He is disappointed to learn that his water payment isn't received. That day Zach receives only the $10 the parents were going to pay him on Monday for his electric bill. Zach is disappointed in his parents again and asks if they'll put it towards his bike next check. Zach begins to save his money because he realizes that he is almost running out and is going to start using his allowance to save. His money adds up to $65 and the landlord sends him a check for $50 for water. Before he is sent home he signs his permission sheet and gives it to his father. He tells Zach that he would like to babysat again and give him another raise for his babysitting work. Zach's father sends $60 to Zach’s bank account so Zach can apply the money to his birthday. Zach sends his father a letter thanking his father for his time and kindness. Zach's father writes back saying he's glad they have reached a compromise that Zach will be able to work hard and help the family and Zach gets the raise as he had asked for. That day Zach

Choices:  A: crack B: antipathy C: being mean D: disinterest E: unfeeling<n>Output:		 B<n><n>Input:  "The man who is born with a disability is just a little handicapped."  "There are things a handicapped person cannot do."  "Someone with a handicap is not equal to a person without a handicap."  "One handicap is the price of admission to being a cripple."  "People think that handicapped people are just helpless, but what most people do not know is that a handicapped person is far from helpless."  "The world would be a better place if handicapped people were treated differently."  "Some handicapped people are capable of doing things that others are not, and the people who are the most capable and able often have a lack of motivation."  "The handicapped person is different to the degree that his or her disability is not recognized as a disability by society."  "When I was a child, I was an extremely handicapped child.  When I was five, my father took me to the doctor and the doctor told my father, "You are going to have to raise your child yourself."  I had been so accustomed to my father telling me to do things that he wanted me to do that when he said his words to me I didn't know what he was talking about.  I was so used to him telling me to do things as opposed to me asking or asking something from other people, that it was very difficult for me.  He told me that there was nothing wrong with me, that I would get stronger and I wouldn't have to be so handicapped.  He knew that I was going to be stronger because he helped me to do things that anyone else wasn't able to do.  I think that every family should be reminded to teach disabled children to look beyond themselves and to see the world the way the world sees it.  Everyone should be taught to be responsible to the disabled as well as the rest of the community.  It is a mistake for parents to believe that the disabled should teach their children how to live a full life.  This would encourage children to take disabled children for granted as adults."

I went alone because I have a date tonight and my husband had no desire to go. I sat with some friends but I kept having to stop because I was shaking so much. It felt like my legs were jelly. I was going to start crying and had to stop. After that I had to get my parents to drive me home so they wouldn't overhear me breaking down in there. I felt so guilty! I know it's a movie about jokes! But I didn't want people to think that because I didn't like the movie it meant I was making fun of others. I felt so bad. The next day I called my dad because I was so frustrated and upset. He said he couldn't believe how upset I was. That I was such a spoiled brat and always wanted to get my own way. When I made eye contact with his friend he thought I was joking because I was so angry. They asked me if I was okay. I asked them how would I feel if they asked me how I felt about "Mean Girls". Everyone answered in a way that was sympathetic and reassuring. When I talked about it later they asked me if I had seen it. I told them I had. I told them what they said. That it was mean and really hurtful. I felt so awkward. I didn't want anyone thinking I had gone to see it out of malice. My dad told me that he was embarrassed. That I was a spoiled brat. That he would never say that to my face but he was trying to protect me. He said he really liked "Caddyshack", "Mean Girls" and "Footloose" and didn't mean to offend anyone. He said he realized that he shouldn't have joked but didn't want me to feel bad about how I felt about those movies. I hate feeling so out of control with my emotions. I want to be able to enjoy movies and not feel like I'm being judged and criticized. I've always felt like my voice is drowned out. It always feels like I talk too much. But I guess that's true.<n>Example: One day at lunch I noticed that the girl next to me at lunch had a big smile on her face. She must have been really happy. She didn't even seem to notice that I didn't like her. There was a really long

John gets a $10 bill when he is done doing his job and John starts to save it for a rainy day.  But $10 is also the best sum a guy is ever likely to see.  It is now time for John to look in the closet with the sock drawer.  So he takes 2 socks that aren't quite so nice as when he wore them last, throws them in the closet with sock drawers and thinks about them all day.  But what is he going to do?  He doesn't have $10 worth of socks, so he could start saving them in the back of his desk drawer or he could buy two more pairs of less-than-ideal socks for now, but then he'd only use the better-looking pair of socks he threw in the closet.  He can't afford the $10 worth of socks he needs to get a bike of his own, so what he should do is buy 2 more sets of less-desirable socks!  John decided on a plan.  John went to the dollar store and grabbed a bag containing 10 $10 bills (worth $22), and headed home.  After lunch, he put the bills into his sock drawers and kept them there until he needed to use his bike.<n>Output: 12<n><n>Input:Where is the cheapest place to buy a new bike?

It doesn't take long for the Elephant to learn that the other elephant is not a threat; he's only worried about the baby, which is fine by the elephant.    After a few minutes in the open, the elephant learns something unexpected: If the other elephant gets too close it can hurt its calf, and if he doesn't touch the calf a few times it will not grow.    After being inside with the elephant, the mother gets to know the elephant better and realizes he's the right fit for her.    She accepts that the elephant loves her a lot and will be spending the rest of her life with her.<n>Output: 7<n><n>Input:When a college student wants a new pair of running shoes and a new pair of pants, he gets 2-3 credit hours and must make sure he gets enough sleep.

Other children were trying to figure out the outcome of John's situation, and many others were trying to figure out Mary's situation. It is also difficult to know where the appropriate line is between discipline and punishment when each situation has some degree of consequence that the child can reasonably be expected to expect.<n><n>If we view the classroom as a large group of independent contractors, then every child has a right and a duty to be heard in order for his/her needs to be met. The classroom is not a "safe space" for every child that will make inappropriate comments. Most other children need some form of accountability for their actions, even if they choose not to discuss the reasons why they made the irresponsible actions. The classroom serves as a place for the most vulnerable children who could be endangered and should be a safe venue to meet the needs of the most vulnerable children that will need additional structure in order to be able to grow or learn. In many cases the most difficult part of the classroom is to manage the needs of these children without creating an atmosphere of animosity between the students and administrators.<n><n>References<n><n>External links

She gives them $10, one dollar.  She says, “I’m going to teach each of you how to write a check. “Give me $10, $1 for yourself,” and $0.90 for the teacher.  Now, before they write a check, you tell them to draw a picture or write something on an envelope.  If they have the pen and paper already prepared, they can write the check on a separate piece of paper.  When they have their pen, they must first write a dollar amount on the bottom left side.  If a question arises, they can always flip it to the next line, and so on.  When they write the check, they write in both of the columns and cross out one dollar amount.  If there is a certain amount they don’t have enough for, they write “0. ”  If they don’t write a check to anybody, they write “1. “After they write their check, they write “Cash?”.  They use the same pen.  The teacher then lets them take a turn writing their school name and last name, along with a check number.  Then, the teacher makes a mark, and each student is responsible for making sure they write it the same way and write it out in both columns.  If they do so, they are responsible for writing the remaining portion of the check, which can be either $4.50 or $6.99.  She then tells them to write another check using the same pen and paper.  They do not use envelopes because they do not have a pen ready, so they must use a pencil.  The teacher asks them to write their name the last time instead of the first time.  They hand their notelets to the teacher.  The teacher then gives them a pen and writes their names and the check number.  The same procedure is followed.”   Output: 44<n><n>A: Raise Corn<n>B: Seed Plants<n>C: Grow Plants<n>D: Seed<n>E: Farm Land<n><n>Choose the Answer:<n><n>B) Raise Corn<n><n>Question: 8.

Once she's found a group of activities that she's interested in, you'll want to encourage her to attend.

That said, there are many other questions in which there are many parts to the problem and no right or wrong answers. There are also some problems which state that multiple choice answers are the key to a good grade. I am not trying to discourage you from making multiple choice answers a part of the problem since they can be very useful. However, in this particular case multiple choice answers are not correct answers because the question states “Input: Mary had 89 sticker.” This does NOT state an answer to the following multiple choice question: “Input: Mary used 3 stickers on the front page and 7 stickers on other pages of her journal, how many stickers does Mary have left?”<n>So, no, in this instance where multiple choice answers are not an answer, make up an answer of your own. This is really important: DO NOT MAKE UP AN ANSWER. That is not allowed on this site. Also, you cannot make up an answer of another teacher’s if it is based on a homework question. Just write your answer on the back of the marker you’ve used, and give it to the teacher.<n><n>(1) Answer: Your homework question says the following: “Input:Mary had 89 stickers. She used 3 large stickers, 7 large stickers, 2 medium stickers on 6 other pages of her jotbook(2), then she used 7 medium stickers on 6 pages of her journal, then she used 8 medium stickers on 3 pages of her journal(1).  How many stickers does Mary still have left?” So, there is no way to answer the given multiple choice question as an answer.

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n>Output:		 4<n><n>In many situations the answer might be A,B,C and D. You will have to explain to them that D is your answer and how this is different than C and E. As you go through this exercise you will identify what they yell at the kids for and your answer (or an alternative answer) will need to be explained to them.<n>Your best bet would be to start with A (parental guidance). Give them an example and explain that D is their answer as well as their response as they see it. You may find some other ways of explaining these ideas, just be patient and give a lot of detail. I recommend starting at A to get them going and move on to a better example, sometimes when I do an assignment for my class I look at them for inspiration on how things run.<n><n>You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou can delete your posts in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forum you can post messages

Some people find it useful to have one large piece instead of individual sheetlets.<n><n>***It is also good practice to ask the student "where are you planning to add the money you saved?" as a prompt to go through the answers in the correct order.**

Choices:  A: snoring B: talking C: get cold D: nothing E: might dream<n>Output:		 2<n><n>Input:The average cost of a car in California in 2002 was $22,832.  The average cost of a car was $21,721 in 2001.  The average price difference between 2002 and 2001 was $13,844.  The average car sales price in 2002 was $19,950.  The average price of a car in 2001 was $17,000.  The 2001 car sales price was higher because cars were more expensive than they were in 2001.  2000 saw fewer cars sold, resulting in more expensive cars.  1999 saw the most expensive cars in U.S. history.  1998 saw the least expensive cars in U. S. history.  The average cost was $12,957 in 1999.  In 1998 the car price increased by $7,743 so $15,000 was the average price.  1997 saw the smallest increase.  This year more cars will be sold.  Since 1998 cars are more expensive in general, you will see the total increase in the auto cost per year be the same.  1997 car sales of 9.1 million cars cost the government $36 billion. 1998 car sales of 10.6 million vehicles cost the government $47 billion. 1999 car sales of 11 million vehicles cost the government roughly $50 billion. 2000 car sales of 12.7 million vehicles cost the government around $55 billion.  2001 car sales of 13.9 million vehicles cost the government another $55 billion.  2002 car sales of 13.6 million vehicles cost not only $55 billion but also $69 billion in interest.  The car cost will only go up if you keep driving.  Since they are more expensive to buy, you will have to drive longer to get the car loan.  If your credit is too poor to make a car loan, you will need $1,832 to get the car.  The car loan cost will be higher for higher credit.<n><n>Click on the "Other" tab above to solve the problem.

To answer the multiple choice question, give the following answer:<n>Output:44<n><n>Input:On Wednesday April 7th all the kids in the class started doing the Math Lesson. The teacher went over the lesson plan three times.  Each of the students had two minutes to finish answering the questions.  The teacher asked each student to give two different answers.  Each time a student answered the questions they were told to change the answer to the next question.  The student that was given the least amount of time was given five extra minutes of time to complete the rest of the lessons. The student that was given less than ten minutes to complete the lesson was given five extra minutes to work on their homework.  What would be the percentage of students who were given less than ten minutes?<n>### Explanation:<n>Every week (except the few days when the teacher had to go to another event), the teacher goes over the questions with the students one more time. The teacher tells students that they are going to have two minutes to come up with as many different answers as possible and then the next teacher will let each of them know how many questions they answered correctly. That way if there are multiple correct answers the teacher can be sure that she will have all the correct ones. The extra five minutes means the teachers have time to talk to the students about their answers. So they don't just have to look at the answer and give it. They have time to talk about their reasoning for taking the answer. She may say "You would prefer to get the question wrong. It could be that you don't think this is a problem or you don't think you know enough math. Or it could be that you don’t need to see more than one answer to get it right.  Either way is ok. Then the student will have the time to think about why they would rather answer the question wrong. Then the student may choose an answer and write it down with their responses.<n>Students in the class are not always the same so the teacher can’t read each student's mind while they are answering the questions. Since the teachers can’t listen to all students at one time, she can read more than one answer.<n><n>Input:The problem: If a group of 2 people do a math problem in a 5 minute period, the number of times they can get that group to work on

It's important to not overdo it, though. For example, when I was a kid, my parents would give us little tokens and I would spend the money in my mother's purse when the money ran out and they'd buy us new clothes and toys. That's a negative reinforcement that encourages you to save your money. Instead, if you let your child help you pick out what he wants, that's positive reinforcement. When the allowance is a big bonus, your child feels like his behavior is valuable and special. If your child is helping other chores, tell him how great his help is when he helps you pick everything out for the rest of the week. You give him more money if he helps you instead of getting extra money for helping.<n><n>We recently used this sort of "compassionate" money to reward Caleb for helping the kids put groceries in the car and loading the car. I gave him a $5 and a $5 in return for taking food to the homeless man. Here's the logic: he'd have been out of pocket for his car insurance if his mother wouldn't have paid for it to begin with and she did help out by paying for it. Also, Caleb can help me by doing another chore for free like unloading his car of groceries or putting away his toys, when he takes his money. I let him do this a couple of times before he finally got the idea that it was okay to get money to help my mom out. He thinks it's funny seeing the money go down the drain, but I also think it encourages him and teaches him to be more altruistic. Plus, his parents got to see how their son was trying to help.<n><n>So, how did you do with this exercise? Were you able to use the "compassionate" or "kind" money, to reward your child's behavior? How did you implement these strategies successfully? Please leave your answers HERE below, (just be polite).<n><n>Comments<n><n>We just discovered this game (from another author) and it is very fun. It's really just as simple as a typical reward card in that kids can earn money to keep in their pocket. However, you can tailor it to your child's personality. For example, you can have him earn his own allowance for things like brushing his teeth, eating his vegetables, not littering, listening to

The car only runs fine for about 6 months out of the year but it is not economical.  Matt has a better car that can go a ways farther without needing to be pumped up.  It is a newer and more comfortable car for both Matt and John.  The car can easily be paid for for the next 2 to 3 years.  Matt also wants John to be able to afford something after the car from the future.  Matt and John can take turns driving the car until it dies at which point they'll sell it for more than twice its original asking price.  The car is an ideal means of transportation when the two of them are together.  If John wants to drive it someplace else after it dies he can just go and get the money out of his bank account and sell it to Matt and trade some of his own money into it when the time comes.<n>Output:Z   A is correct

But you know where those kids are coming from.  If those kids really want to get out of class once in a while, they can always walk around the corner.  When they feel like it they can go back inside.  In the next class you give each student another chance so they can talk about the other kids.  I'm sure you will hear some new things and maybe you'll get some new answers.  This will help your class become successful for a year.<n><n>The parents have a new baby and they have to buy everything they need for the baby's room.

After each trip, the man takes the man outside to show him photos of his family.  They exchange numbers and begin corresponding via email.  They discuss plans to meet at some point.  At the same time, the man meets another man who works at the Citi bank and also lives nearby.  He takes the man on a date, then has dinner with him, but they don't go to a romantic restaurant, instead going to lunch.  It is later learned that both men are divorced.  When the Citi employee gets home from work, he receives a phone call.  His wife has gone into labor.  The man, having learned this, offers to drive the man's wife to the hospital in his small car.  He calls his wife's relatives to pick her up.  When he arrives at the hospital, he learns that the father of the woman who gave birth is a member of the church whose minister is the minister of the congregation.  The minister, feeling that the matter has been attended to, leaves.  When he gets home, he receives another call.  This time, the woman he had taken to the hospital in his car is no longer pregnant.  The man returns to work after picking up his wife.  He then goes with his family to McDonald’s for burgers.  His wife and her cousin discuss their options for dealing with their financial problems.  It is learned that the man's first wife had been the mother of his son.  The girl's name was Mary.

She noticed a new webpage open. She looked at the webpage to see what it was. She was surprised. Because she had been studying so hard, she hadn't seen it. However, it was very important to her and she didn't want it to be taken away. The site was not for other students at school. Since she was looking at it, that was the only way she could finish her homework. She was sad. What if it was removed from her computer and she had to restart from the beginning? She felt very sad about that. Did she lose a significant amount of her time?<n>Output: D<n><n>You can make your algorithm faster by changing the number of parameters, so that the algorithm will fit more data. With smaller parameters, the time for calculating the answers will be shorter, while the number of outputs will be the same. For example, if N=1, 1 could be used to increase parallel computing capacity, and this would speed the algorithm. This will help you solve the problem faster. You can change N to many different numbers.<n>Output: 2<n><n>input can be a variable that has length N. By setting this variable to N you can make the algorithm bigger and the response time faster. When you choose N for this particular algorithm, the output will be on the number of outputs. The number you choose is the size of the output array.

All the other students in John's class are unaware of John's parents. The teacher notices that John is shy, so she gets John alone to show him some of the social skills that she expects from her other students. After John shows her a few simple things, the teacher asks John if he is shy. John responds with, "I wouldn't say that I am shy. I used to be a lot more timid." At that, the teacher raises her hand and says to John, "You are my first shy child. I want you to know that it comes with getting older." The student is happy when the teacher explains that he can be shy because no one likes to hear about their first shy student, but the teacher is upset when John insists that he is not shy. When John tries to explain that he was not shy when he was younger, the teacher says, "Good. Then you are young. You are only a junior in high school and still have plenty of time to develop your social skills. When you become more mature, you will come to realize that you have many social talents just waiting to be discovered." The final line from the teacher concludes, "I expect a lot from you, I do not want you to disappoint me and let me down. You have a bright future ahead. I'm just proud of you."<n>Output: (X 1) 2(X 1) 3

Jack thinks the child might be smart enough to read what he writes on the back of his business cards.  If Jack can find out if the child knows the back of the card when he gets home, he can then tell his employer about it.   Jack decides to test the kid.  He can either leave his business card in the worker's office and tell him the back of the card says "I am Jack." or he can write all the business information including his first name on the card and present it to him.   Jack decides he is an idiot for trying to impress his co-worker. Since it was on a company business card, he can't read back the information he wrote on it. Jack keeps his business card anyway since it contains his full real name and his real phone number. If Jack later calls or writes on the card about knowing his co-worker is a smart child, he can tell his employer that he wrote it on the card and tell them what it says.<n>Input: Zach is buying a brand new bike for $100.

Choices:  A: obtaining information B: exchange of ideas C: sharing information D: conversation E: gathhering of information<n>Output:		<n>Feedback: Zach needs a better way to collect information.  He can make one of his class mates look at his journal for ideas. (This is a great idea:  Zach should try to give the classmate an envelope with the journal on it, so that he will have an idea about how Zach is collecting the information, rather than getting the journal itself.)<n>Feedback: Zach can make sure he doesn’t forget to look in the journal every time he reads through it. It’s very easy to put a blank page in front of the notebook so his parents don’t know what he is writing.<n>Feedback: It would be better to exchange information. But as Zach sees Zach trying to talk to other students, he’ll start to realize that he needs to get better at talking to other kids. He needs to think of himself as a teacher of sorts instead of a participant in the brainstorming process.

Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n>Output:		 13+<n><n>Solution for week 5<n><n>Explanation: When grooming, you are giving up the pleasure of handling the item that you are grooming. You only feel gratification with a change in status. This is why grooming in a relationship is such a problem. Because the relationship changes from helping someone to looking to them needing help the grooming will feel very selfish to the one being groomed, and will make the groom feel less needed.<n><n>Assignments must be at least one page long.

The next time Zach rode over another sharp rock, Mary asked him to stop riding.  Zach responded, "Okay."  When Zach was not riding over sharp rocks anymore, Mary asked him if he still wanted to ride over the sharp rocks.  The next time Zach rode, Mary asked him to ride over the sharp rock again and he did.  Since Zach continued to not ride over the sharp rocks, Mary got worried.  The following Monday Zach was telling Mary that he had not been seeing her lately.  Zach said that he was going to try to change his habits.  Instead of saying that his bad habits made him not see her, Zach said that he could not see her because his bad habits made him see all of the dirt and the rocks.  Mary asked Zach what he thought about his habits and he responded saying that he did not want to see dirt and the stones too.  Zach said that if he wanted to see dirt and stones then he would have to go in the back.  The next time that Zach rode over a sharp corner, Mary asked again if he wanted to ride over the stones.  When Zach was riding over the stones, Mary stood up from the riding seat and asked him if he wanted to ride on the rocks as well.  When Zach was driving over the rocks, Mary gave him another piece of advice.  She told him that he should start riding on the rocks less because his car had broken down four times. He then suggested she should stop giving him her advice so he would not get stuck on the rocks for so long.  Zach continued to ride over the rocks and on Tuesady he went outside of his neighborhood and mowed his neighbor's lawn.  On Sunday Zach stopped and talked to the neighbor and said that he should do the lawn because it took his mind off of the dirt and the stones.  The neighbor said that he did not want Zach to do the lawn so Zach said that he would do the grass because it made him happy to mow the grass

The next day, she got off the airplane and went to Walmart.  She bought $16 worth of toilet-ries.  She wanted to buy some of them with her check-out but they don't accept checks.  She asked 2 store employees what to do so she can buy the toilet-ries with her check-out.  The first store employee replied, you can't.  You are going to need an credit or debit card.  The second store employee told her that that store wouldn't let her use a credit card either. So, the next time she goes to Walmart, she will go to a different Walmart and order the toilet-ries on the Internet.

I've gone over every aspect of it so far."  Mary laughs and tells him that "it is not worth your time writing my report because you will not understand it until the end of the week!  Sam, I don't have time for this!"  Sam replies that she "would gladly spend more time studying with me if it meant that you would both be more happy!"  Mary retorts that "right now I'm doing as much of my homework as I can, but my brain hurts because it's tired, not because of what I'm doing!"  Sam replies that "You can't study and be happy all the time.  You know that, right?  Do your assignments and then go play ball, go to the computer, and go out for a walk.  It's what makes you happy.  If you're not working on your homework, then you're not getting anything done.  Don't you ever forget that!"  Mary tells him that "I understand now and that I am a better person because of it...but I don't have time to play ball with you."  Sam replies that he can do the same thing in his room: "Sam, I think you're probably right about how busy I am most of the time.  You've got me thinking: who are my friends?  Who does everyone expect me to call and who should I invite to my home?  If it makes you feel better, I'll go play hockey with a friend who lives right across the city."

Alyssa thought her parents were playing pretend, and told her sister that the teachers invited them to come to school for a day.  Alyssa was expecting her parents to put on their costumes and pretend to the kids.  After explaining what happened to her sister, Alyssa decided to make her costume instead.  She hid her costume and hid her sisters under her bed.  She put her sister's costume on and put a pillow over her face to put her in the closet.  She thought the teachers would take pictures in her classroom with their cameras, so she quickly hid her camera.

The teachers called Alyssa's parents and learned that her sister was taken away to the emergency room.  Alyssa came back to school and found her sister in her normal clothes.

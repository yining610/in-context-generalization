One week is up.  Four more are up.  Five more are up. And the rest of the time is all on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays.  On a normal day, what is the chance that the school will be completely destroyed on a given Sunday?\nOutput: The chance to build a building is 2/(3*4*5*6)*40.\nSince the chance to build a house is 2/(4*5*6*9)*40, the chance to build a school is =2/(4*5*5).  So on the days when there are 4 total, the chance that the school is destroyed on those days is =2/(4/2).\nThe rest of time has been on weekdays, so there have been no days on which there were 3 days when the school was down and no Sunday days when the school was up.\nWhen looking with a normal eye at the chance of being destroyed on a given Sunday, you can find the average of 2/3 in a line that goes from 0-2/3.\nSince the chance is 2/(3*2/3)*2, the average chance to be destroyed on a given Sunday is =2/(3)*(-4*2*2*2).\nBecause there are only 2 Sundays that the school will be destroyed on, on any given Sunday, the chance of the school being rebuilt is 2/(8*8*)^10.\nSo a normal person using the power of his eyes to see in a normal day, has seen 60*8*10*10 chances of the school be burned down per week in a year, but has seen 120*8*10*6 chances of the school being rebuilt per year.\n\nInput: Two men had to buy ten gallons of ice water.

A = 2A\nIf a=2, then the squares between 2A and A are all divisible by a. A is divisible by 2, but if a=2+2+2, then A is not divisible by 2. A is so divisible that its only two occurrences are divisible by it (2A, 2A+2) and it can be divisible by 1, but only 3 times (2, 1, 1). A has a minimum of 2 pairs of numbers in each square root (2A, 1, 1 and 1) and maximum of 6 pairs of numbers in each pair (2+2+, 2+2+, 2+3+3+3+4, 2+1+2+3+, 2+1+2+, 2+1+1+, 2+1+0+1+0+0+0+).\nBecause there are so few pairs of numbers in each, a=2 means that a pair of numbers are more probable than 1 or 0 being in the square root, so 2+2+2 gives us the greatest amount of pairs of numbers in a square root.\nIf 2+2+2+2+0+0+1+1+1 = 4, then A is 4\nPairs of numbers between these numbers give us even better odds of having at least one pair of numbers (2+2+) and if there are any pairs of numbers between these numbers, we have the greatest chance of having a pair of numbers between these numbers that are divisible by 2(2+2+, 2", "answer": "D: food court"}

How many people died from the hurricane in Katrina in 2005?   Output: If you go down the graph and count people, it looks like only 3 people died in both incidents.  If you go up the graph and count deaths as they occur, you can figure that most of the deaths were due to the flooding.  In fact, we have no idea about a single death from either event.  The total number of people who died due to the tornado in Moore was 3x the number of people who died from Hurricane Katrina.  So it is likely that more people died from that storm.  It is also likely that more people died of the tornado in Moore than in Katrina.  The total number who died as a result of the storm in Moore was 8x the number who died in Hurricane Katrina.  Thus, it is likely that more than a thousand people died because of this tornado.\n\nInput:What are the top 10 cities that are overpopulated in the United States?\nOutput:  According to Wikipedia, according to Census 2011,  \"in 2006", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

The dog received a bite from a larger dog who licked the bleeding wound.  2.  The dog received several bites on his arm, all at the same time.  3.  The dog received numerous bites on his arm, and one of them was a bite from another dog.  4.  The dog received two or more bites on his arm.  5.  The dog received more than one bite from the same dog.  6.  The dog received 1 bite from a dog's bite.  7.  A dog chewed the peach while it was in the dog's mouth.  8.  The dog licked the bleeding wound himself.  9.  The dog received the two or more bites at once.  10.  The dog received bite marks from several dogs at the same time.\nOutput:  A bite from another dog's mouth is incorrect.  A bite from another's bite results in 3 different injuries.  A bite from his own bite is correct.  A second bite from the same dog results in 2 separate injuries, not one from a bite from another dog and not one from a bite by another dog.  An object from another dog biting the dog's mouth is correct.  An object from a bite from another's mouth is incorrect, both because of the way they interact and because the dog's wounds are all in one area.  A bite from a larger dog licked the dog's arm.  A bite from the dog's own bite from the same larger dog results in 3 different injuries that are all due to different causes.  A bite from one dog is correct while a bite from multiple dogs is incorrect.  One bite from another dog resulted in licking by the dog, not chewing.

By the time the tripping occurred the tripping mechanism would have been so old that the arm's breaking force would have weakened.  In other words, if he tripped and broke an arm, he would have broken his neck.\nOutput: In the case that the Tripping Mechanism is working, there are 12*3=18 steel rods in a square frame. This would equal the force of the Tripping Mechanism pushing forward on the frame.\nSince there are 18 rods in the square frame, the Tripling Mechanism's pushing will extend the frame by 90*180=180.\nSince there are 180 rods in the square frame and the Tripling Mechanism is pushing, the frame will remain approximately 6*18 = <<6*18=60>>60 feet tall.\nSince there are 60 rods in the frame, he will fall roughly three feet to his left and land on a metal-rod.  While under the rod he will die.\nSince there are 6 rods in the frame, there is also a safety mechanism that will protect him from falling on the rod.\nSince there are 300 rods in the frame, if he stays under the rod longer than three hours, the tripping mechanism will be too weak to protect him and he will die.", "answer": "B: construction site"}

He now has $600,000 to use how? Output:\nJohn bought a boat in 1981 for $500.  He sold it for $10,000 in 1986.\nThe boat had a value of $600,000 in 1983.\nHis money is now worth $500,000.\nTherefore, $600,000 x $500,000 = $10,000,000\nThe only difference to how many boat sales John has is how much he earned.  Therefore, when he wants to buy a boat, he is going to pay $10,000, so $1,000,000 is the difference.  Since John made $10,000, he has $1,000,009.

The meeting must start at 10:00 a.m., 1/2 hour before the scheduled start time.  At the scheduled time, find a quiet corner of the restaurant in the corner closest to where the meeting starts. How many seats at the meeting should be at least 10 feet away from each other on a long wall?\nOutput: The perfect spot for the meeting is the corner furthest from the entrance.  The meeting should include at least 4 seats of at least 10 feet each.\nFour seats are 3 feet apart, 1/2 of a meter is 2.85 feet.  Since the corner nearest the entrance is more remote than any spot farther away, the length of the wall from the corner furthest from entrance would be about 3 times greater than the length of any spot farther away, and that is why there should be at least 4 seats at least 15 feet away from each other.  This way, at least four patrons are sitting together.  Thus, 4 seats are 4x2.85.  The distance from the corner furthest away to the corner furthest from door should be at least 2 times this distance.  If the corner furthest away from the entrance has a wall with 2 squares, it can be calculated to be 7x2.85.\nIn this case, 6 = 5.14.  Thus, each of these squares would be 4x7 = 10x10 = 27x10.  In the case of 7x7, each square would be 5x6 = 17.1x5 = 42x10.  Using the above formula and the fact they had a lot of room for noise on the far end of seating to create more room for noise at the opposite end of seating, the walls between the tables would measure at least 6.5x14.5 square feet. Thus, there were 10x16 squares.  So, for each, the total size was at least 9.5x11.5 square feet.  The distance between the corner nearest the entrance and the corner furthest away should be at least 3 times this distance,", "answer": "C: that you"}

How long do these 10 minutes take to be at risk for death?\nOutput: The time it takes for you to be at risk for dying would be the risk per minute. Therefore, 50 minutes would take 4 times 30 seconds. So that would mean that if you breathe out your nose for 30 seconds, then if you do it 15 more seconds, your heart rate would rise, and if you do it 15 minutes faster, your blood pressure would fall. The total chance of dying in 30 seconds would be 15 times 30 = 15 minutes of heart rate rises, 15 minutes of blood pressure falls and 15 minutes of higher oxygen content of the air. So the overall chance of dying in 30 second in the lungs due to the air pollution would be at a probability of 15/60 = 1 in 60 minutes.\nTherefore, if this happens twice in a day, that is 60 seconds every time.

The rule is on offense you must shoot the ball first before anyone else can. If a free throw goes in, the ball must be thrown back to the side of the court where it went in - with the offensive player in place. If an offensive foul is called on the player, the ball is thrown to anyone else. The 3 other offensive players on the court have to either pass the ball to the foul line or shoot a short free throw to restart the game. If the player passes or shoots a free throw that is called a foul, then the player at the point of the foul can either come back to the court or try to get another shot away from the basket.\nIf anyone else shoots a short free throw (and it goes in), the ball is not allowed back on the court.\nIf a player passes the ball up to the offensive player, then they are called for a goaltend. If a player throws a long kick to the defensive player, in order to set the ball in motion for said kick, that is an offensive rebound. If an offensive player jumps on a defensive player for an inbounds play, the ball is thrown back unless it is deflected. If an offensive player picks up a rebound and shoots a long shot, then the ball can be passed to them but they are not allowed to return it to the court. If an offensive player comes back and tries to grab a rebound, the offensive player is out of bounds unless they were a long rebound. If an offensive rebound is picked up by someone", "answer": "A: tennis elbow"}

Finally he realized that he had made a much better idea than he had thought.  The horse was very helpful during the course of the day and he still didn't want him to get on the boat at night.\nThe next morning, Jordan found that Perry was getting tired. He didn't think anyone could run a boat with a horse on it, but Jordan realized the horse wasn't going to fall asleep. He couldn't think of what else to do, so he decided to give the horse a rest. He wanted a break from their long journey and he asked the driver to change directions.\nThe horse started to slow down, so he took the first turn in the wrong direction and the horse got excited. Jordan thought this was more interesting than walking, so he kept running until the horse lost interest in running and settled down.

The following is 100*50 =<<100*50=96>>96 pieces of data.\nIf you make one mistake, this translates to 6*96 = <<6*96=288>>288 pieces of data.\nBut of course if you ever make one mistake in a row, this just shows that the numbers are meaningless.\nSo this answer is 96.\nBut what if I have 100% accuracy in this game, and also always score the same points in every game?\nThen this answer would be 96.5\n\nInput:There were three cars sitting at a red light on the side of the road. A truck also stopped at the red light with another car still parked there. The truck driver had been here before and came out first. Now he is waiting for the first car to drive out of the light. The truck driver is counting on it to go out fast. If his driver takes too long, he'll stop the truck to make sure it's finished sooner than the light turns green.\nOutput: The lights went green after 7 seconds and then they waited another 7 seconds. The truck was stopped at this point.\nWhen the light turns green again, the truck driver will start driving out. Then the car with the stopped light comes out first. They may have to stop at the light or wait a little longer to drive out of the red light.\nIf the car is already running the red light, they might have to wait until it turns green again. If the light is running for another 7 seconds, the light will turn green again.\nThe 3 cars will drive away after about 8 seconds. Their time was 7 seconds long.\nThe truck got about half way to the light when it turned green again. When it does, they will move more slowly.\n\nInput:Who invented the first video game?\nOutput: This is very difficult.

Mrs. Rachael paid $12 for the dress. She selected 50 shoes for the wedding. The total of shoes for the wedding was 120 shoes. How many shoes had more than one buyer?\nOutput: At least half the shoes exceeded 60 dollars. At least half of the shoes had more than one bidder.\nAt least 80 of the 120 shoes had more than one bid\nIf most the shoes had at least one bidder, the total sales sales (120 shoes) would have made the bride happy, this should mean there are about 40 shoes that she will never wear again. She won\u2019t even consider buying or wearing any of these shoes again.\nSo the final number is 80\n\nInput:Jodie bought a new pair of sandals that had one size over a normal size. So she bought two new sizes of sandals. They were each $150, but they each cost $100 to purchase. She bought 25 pairs so that they would sell for $1,5. How much profit did she make per pair?\nOutput: If she sold out all her shoes for $150, she would have made $150 profit per pair for each pair.\nAt least 90 pairs of the new sandals were sold out. 90 sets of shoes sold for $1,5\nHow much will she get for selling out all her shoes?\nSo the final profit from Jodie\u2019s shoes for the day is $150+150+1,5 = $210.\nHer shoes sold for $210 in all her pairs, so she made $210 profit (per pair) for the day\n\nInput:On November 19th, the day of the home sale, four people walked into the", "answer": "A: think"}

For a total of 30 ounces for each apple, how much should you calculate?\nOutput:The total is 30 / 5 = <<30*5=90>>90 ounces.\nSince you have 5 apples, the total weight for each apple is 45% of the total weight of all of these apples. In total, the apples weigh 90 ounces.\nThis is what we would have calculated if you had 10 apples.\nIf you have five apples on a table, the total weight for any apple is 10% of the total weight. In total, the table weighs 90 ounces.\nThis means if you had 10 apples on the table, you would have calculated the total weight as: 45*10 = 30 ounces\nSo the number of apples you would need to weigh is now 30*10 = 15 ounces!\nSince you have 15 apples on the table, the total weight of all apples is 15 ounces!\nThis is how the numbers would have translated to the final answer: 30*15 = 60 ounces\n\nInput: How many different types of flowers are there?

{"text": "Let's say the shadow moves from the north to the south so let's take the moon into account. To the east of the moon is the building. If the shadow moved an additional 5 feet north, it would go to the east side of the moon. The shadow is then shifted 4 hours west so it comes 4 hours later at noon. If the shadow moved south in the same direction, it would be 2 hours later so it is the same today as it was 4 hours ago. If the shadow moves north east, it would move towards the ground so the current answer is to the east, bridge, ground, bright light\nOutput:So when the shadow moves 1 hour west and changes direction from north to south, it will reach the east. But where will it move from 6 hours ago? It will be 2 hours south so it is closer to the east than the bridge, which is closer to the ground than the moon, which is closer to bridge than the ground, which is closer to bright light which is closer to ground than moon, etc. so the sun is the answer to the question.\n\nInput (as a pair)\n\n Q: Why is it the case that the sun sets 5 minutes later than 5 AM?  Why not at 5 PM?    A:  We used to believe that the moon casts the shadow by 4 AM so that means when the sun is at the right place at the right time it would rise at 5 AM instead of 4 AM and set at 5 PM instead of 4 PM.    I guess that's not true.\n\nOutput:If the sun would be at the zenith at 5 AM, it takes another 45 minutes for it to reach the zenith at noon.\n\nInput (alone))  Q: How often does the sun rise at sunrise? A: once a day. A: once a day, every day\nQ: What happens every time the sun rises? A: The sun takes 12 seconds to reach the center of the earth, and thus 9.5 days until it reaches the zenith at the zenith.\nQ: But what does that have to do with the time of day? A: Because it happens, there is nothing to do. So it can be considered part of the time.  Q: But what does that mean to me, the human being? A: It means a little more time has to exist outside the space time continuum than is needed to keep us in the world.", "answer": "D: ground"}

The number two is equal to 45 because it adds five plus zero to get two negatives.  The number four is equal to 45 because you subtract the sum of three positives and three negatives from 45 to get 45.  So when you give it an integer plus a positive or negative, it will put three positives and three negatives together to get 45 or two negatives.  So when you use five or four, you can multiply an integer by a pair plus a negative, and it will subtract the sum to get a positive.  When you give it an integer minus a pair plus a negative (e.g. a minus 5 * a minus 2), it will subtract three positives and three negatives to get negative 5, and when you give it a negative, it will subtract both positives and negatives from it to get negative 2.

When the boss gives out his annual bonus, he uses a simple formula to determine where the business is headed.  Calculate how much money the boss needs to give the boss to reach his goal.\n\nOutput: The business owner starts with $11 of gross profit and subtracts any expenses other than what is needed to maintain the business.\nIf the business had $11 of gross profit on January 1st and $10 of gross profit on April 9th, then subtract $1, so that leaves $9 of gross profit each month.  Subtract $1 from the $9 because it is not enough money that the business can afford to lose this month.\nTo get rid of the expenses except from the required costs of maintaining the business, subtract $1 from the business owner's gross profits each month.\nIf the business is losing $1 of gross profit each month, the business owner should subtract $1 from gross profits each month.

But if it's just right (the pepper has too much seasoning) then it'll all balance out.  So if there's too much salt and you add some other pepper & salt, the other flavors will combine better.

In this scenario, the person who made the most money was able to live to work until 80. The person with the lowest IQ decided to work as long as he could instead. Which one of the following conclusions would you reach?\nAnswer: With the current job market for IQ workers, if both of the IQ workers make the most money, then the person who had the highest IQ has a good chance of increasing his lifetime earnings by having the highest probability of earning more than most money. The person with the IQ who will make the most money also has a good chance of making the most money if the person who makes the most money lives as long as the person with the lowest IQ. If either of the IQ people live for longer than the other, then the person who made the highest IQ would have a high chance of making more money, because they are a better prospect than either of the IQ workers who live for shorter durations. If neither of them live very long, then the person who makes the least money would have a good chance of making more money than the IQ people who work the longest durations, because their earnings would be higher than each of the IQ workers who work shorter durations.\n\nInput: A man and woman were travelling in separate cars.

The shadow from building 6 extends 1 foot, and the shadow from building 3 extends 1 foot, but it does not extend 2 additional feet. So which shadow does extend two additional feet and by how much? (Choose 2)\nOutput: Since the shadow from the building extends 1 foot for every hour past noon, this means the shadow from building 3 would extend 2 feet. The shadow from building 2 would extend 3 feet, while the shadow from building 1 would extend 4 feet. The shadow from the rear wall would not extend 2 feet. Since these shadows overlap each other, the shadow from building 3 extending 2 feet would make the shadow from building 2 extending 3 feet. The shadow from construction 1 extending 4 feet would make the shadow of building 2 extending 4 feet. Since these shadows form an \"L\" shape, the shadow from building 1 extending 4 feet would create an \"L\" shape. Thus, the shadow extending 4 feet would cause the shadow from building 3 to extend 3 feet. This completes the L-shape.\nOutput: If the shadow from building 3 extended 2 feet, this means the shadow of building 3 would extend 3 feet. If the shadow from building 1 extended 4 feet, this means the shadows from building 1 and building 3 would extend 4 feet.\nThis completes the L-shape\nOutput: Since the shadows from building 3 extend 2 feet for every hour past noon this means the shadows from buildings 1 and 2 would extend 2 feet.\nSince the shadows from buildings 3 and 4 extend 4 feet for every hour past midnight this means the shadows from the surrounding buildings would extend 4 feet. This is because the shadows are moving towards the center of the building in the direction from the ground level to the rooftop.\nHowever, the shadows from the building 4 extending 4 feet would make all of the above shadows 3 feet. Thus, the shadows from each building would extend all four feet.\nOutput: If there are 6 hours past noon, the shadow from building 2 extends 3 feet. The shadow in building 3 extends 4 feet. The shadow in Building 4 extends 4 feet. The shadows from the neighboring building extend 4 feet. This means that only three shadows would extend 4 feet. Since the shadows from building 4 are extending 4 feet, the shadows from building 2 would extend 5 feet. The shadow from tower 1 would extend", "answer": "A: friend's house"}

They were both fired and had to buy their own transportation to get to their jobs.   The workers in the front of the factory worked 24 hours per day.  There was a bus to the back of the factory that came every 15 minutes.   The factory manager told the workers in the back of the factory they would have time to take their lunch break and stretch their legs during the 14 hour shift.   The company would only hire one of the fired workers for the 14 hour shift.\nOutput: If the workers in the front of factory worked 24 hours per hour.  As a result, the factory manager said they would hire one person to work 14 hour shifts.  Both of the front of the factory workers were paid a wage at a lower amount than the employees in the back of the facility.  In exchange for the lower hourly wage, the front of the factory employees would have plenty of time to stretch their legs during the lunch break.  All of the work in the back of the warehouse was in a warehouse that was a fraction of the size of the factory.  The front of the warehouse was not in a warehouse that had as much capacity to work as any other warehouse.  Therefore, the company was able to cut costs by hiring the employee to work 14 hours instead of 12 hours even though the company knew the employee worked only half as hard as the employees in the back.  All of the time saved by the employee in the back was lost in the way the company spent money on the employee and in the way the company took a hit on how much work the employee worked.  This is because the employee worked only half the time as the other two employees in the warehouse and also had to endure the constant reminders that their job had been eliminated.  The company spent less than it would have used to hire another worker for the 14 hour shift and had to pay a lower hourly wage to the employees in the back instead.  The result is that no extra money was used to pay", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}

The bus that took most buses to work on the first day was on the fifth lane. If each bus follows the same route, there are 40,000 buses a day in the city that use that route.  How many buses travel that route per hour?\nOutput:\nSince there are 200 buses a day, the first bus goes off the fifth lane at 6 a.m and the last bus goes off the fifth at 8 p.m.  So there are 40 buses that travel the route per hour and there are 20 buses that don't travel that route per hour.\nThe bus that takes the most buses to work is the bus whose route is the least likely to be changed, for example the route that takes 10,000 buses to work.

{"text": "All three of the above should be true. In a recent case, a couple tried to find the smell, but every room they examined contained no smell.  The first guess was that the couple had a mold problem, so they took the refrigerator to the home improvement store. The couple asked for help identifying the mold so they could find a way to rid their house of it. The couple asked the store's employees to check their cabinets, but all of their cabinets were fine.  Finally, the couple found the source of the mold in the couple's kitchen because nothing was working in the kitchen. In order to determine the cause, the couple asked the employees what they thought the smell could be. After some questioning, a store employee told the couple that the smell could be due to the stove or to a gas heater. So the couple ordered a new, hot stove for the house so that the stove's burners would not ignite more spores in the air.  The new stove was delivered to the couple the same day that the store manager visited the couple and told them that there was no room to hide in the store. So now the store manager and store employee agreed that it would be the better thing to do to rid their house of the mold so that it could then be replaced. It would also be safer to replace their stove in case of an emergency if an explosion occurred. So the couple decided to replace the new stove with the old stove so they would not need both. They replaced the new stove with the new stove, then, they discovered the mold.  So the couple decided that they would not have to replace the stove after all. The new stove should keep the couple well protected from mold from ever reoccurring in their house\n\nInput:The first four digits of the number are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Output: The amount of time you have to eat at the buffet meal is 1/2 the time it takes to order a dessert alone\nIf time spent to eat alone = time for diner to prepare dessert, then diner is eating alone for 1/2 time. If time spent to order dessert alone = time that takes servers to prepare dessert, then waiter is eating alone for 2/2 time. If your wait is 1/8 of the time of server in the restaurant, then you can eat solo for 8 hours.\nOutput: There are 8 * 1/8 = 9 seconds between when server says your name and your dessert is delivered.\nTherefore, the time to eat at the buffet is 1/9 of 1/8 of 1/8 of 9.\nSo the final amount to eat before server notices you is 9 - 2*0*1/8 + 1 = 14.\nBecause 1+1 = 2, you have to figure how much extra time you have to eat alone to eat the full amount of time before server is notified of your eating.\nSo the final number to eat and eat alone is 14.\n\nInput: You have to add up how much money you receive from each of these items.

In miles per gallon it would be: 0.1056 +.30 = 0.1070\nOutput: It would take 50 miles to fill the car with gas if it was full. So the car is already 6/10ths full!\nOutput: Since it takes 50 miles to fill the tank of a 20 gallon diesel tank and the car in question is going to burn out in 40 miles, the car would have only enough gas for 20.066 miles of driving after only 10 hours of driving.\nOutput: Therefore, the car has more than enough fuel in it to cover 60 miles. Therefore, the car has enough fuel to drive around the block 5 times.\nOutput: So the car has enough fuel for 2.1664 miles of driving after just 10 hours of driving. Therefore, the car would actually need only 2.1696 miles to drive around the block 6 times; i.e. it takes 4.056 hours to drive around the block.\nSo the car has only enough fuel to drive around a city block 5 times. Therefore, the house is completely drained of gas.\nThis is a fairly easy test; I recommend you practice it by driving through an alley, then back up to your house and pump gas into the car.

If you choose the opposite answer, you'll know the answer to this question, so make sure both answers are yes.\n\nInput: If A is a number of zeroes and B is an integer of ten thousand, what is the number of zeros between 0 and 10,000?\nOutput: The number of zeroseese between 0 and 10,0000 is between 0 and 10,001, or the difference between the positive and negative zeroseese.\nThe first three items contain numbers with no zeroes.\nThe next three items contain numbers that are a multiple of 10,000.\nThe next two items contain numbers that are the difference between positive and negative zeroweese, or between zero and nine.\nSo the number of zeroses between 0 and 10,0001 is between 10,001 and 10,001,000\n\nInput:What will a line of dots show when viewed at a different distance and at different angles?\nOutput:The dots will show an equal number of lines.\nThe first set of dots will be equal in total length to the last set of dots.\nThe second set of dots will give equal distance between each pair of dots.\nThe third set of dots will be a combination of the first two.\nSo if you add one more dot than necessary to find the length of the first set, you get the next two dots.  If you subtract one dot than necessary from the second set to find the length of that set, you get the third set.\nIt is the distance between the first set and the third set that tells you what the number of dots will be.\nThe number of lines will be the number of dots.\n\nInput: How large must the line of dots be before it is clear?\nOutput: The question is for a small area.\nThe first", "answer": "D: mouth"}

Let X represent the number of pieces used in the attack and Y represent the number of times of position X \"captures\" position Y.  The chess board would be as follows:\ninput: X 1\n\nOutput: Suppose X1 was a pawn and X2 was an knight. Now suppose X1 attacked with a pawn and X2 attacked with a knight. When X1 moved to X2, it moved exactly one space at a time, since the two sides were on equal ground. When X2 moved, it moved exactly two spaces at a time, since X2 was directly on the king side or the queen side. Since X2 attacked with a piece of X2, the attack is a \"capture\" for the piece which X2 attacked with. Therefore, Y has to win 2/2 of the time which means the game is a \"capture\". When X1 attacked X2, X1 could not attack Y since he was captured, then X2 attacked Y, and then X1 attacked the king. However, since X2 attacked only queen side, X2's attack may still be a \"capture\" if both queen and king move at the same time.\nInput: Y 1\n\nOutput: Y2 is a piece and Y1 is also a piece. All the pieces are in the right hand side. X1 and X2 has both attacked the same chess board. When X1 attacks X2, X2 also attacks it, because of the way the pieces are placed. When X1 attacks Y2, Y2 just attacks X1. The chess board is now on the queen side, since Y2 is on the king side. X1 still has the same amount of pieces on the left hand and right hand sides, while X2 has only the king and queen on the queen side. Therefore X2's attack is not a \"capture\" since Y2 cannot attack it due to the way the pieces are positioned. Therefore X1 has won 3/3 of the time since he attacked with a piece of the same color, that is, Y2. When X1 attacked X3, X3 also attacked with a piece of Y2, and both pieces were", "answer": "D: louisiana"}

The temperature was 55oF by noon.\nFrom noon to six, it only burned 6 minutes from a time of 9 AM until people arrived.\nSo the origin was not the fire itself. It was not the distance from the fire to where it burned.\nFrom 9AM to noon the fire only burned 2 minutes. So the fire started at 2PM, at six o\u2019 clock and it started under a bridge, right next to the city, near a church. The reason there was a fire at 6AM is that it was in the shade of a tree.\nFrom noon to 6PM it burned 6 minutes. So the fire only burned 2 more hours. The temperature was 55^oF by noon. From noon to 6PM the temperature was 20^oF, but the fire was burning in the shade, which caused it to burn less long.\nSo the final fire time estimate was 20^oF > 2^oF > 5^oF > 6^oF\nSo the final fire guess was 20^oF >> 2^oF >> 5^oF >> 6^oF >> 6 hours.\nSo the final guess was 6 hours.\nSo how long does it take for the weather to go from 55oF to 20^oF on a 12-hour day?\nSo the final guess is 10^oF > 5% > 35% > 65% > 100\nFrom November through April, the temperatures ranged from 55 to 65.

How many people could work at a farm?  What percentage of those 300,000 people are women?  What percentage of 100,000 are boys?  What percentage of women are over the age 21?  What percentage of men are over the age 21  and under 21?\nOutput: Assuming 300,000 work at a farm, n = 300,000 * 30 = 1200,000 women.  The other women are under 21.  If 100,000 boys are working at the farm, how many of them are over the age of 21?  And how many are under 21?\nSince most of the men are over 21, about half of the boys are over 21 when they start working.  If 100,00 boys are working at the school, how many are under 21 while they are there? And how many are over 21 while they are working there?\nOutput: If half the boys are over 21 and half are under 21, then n = 150,000 x n = 300,000.  To find n, we divide 300,000 + n = 150,000 by 30.  Since 300,000 = 1200,000 * 30 = 12,000 women = 100,000. So at 50 work-days, n is 1200.\nAssuming n-10 = n, we know that 300,000 = 1200 = 12,000 * 18 = 633,000 men.\nSince the school holds about 633 students + 633 = 633,000 workers, therefore n=633,000 * 633 = 6000.", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

That's 1/2 hour of \"time out\", every single day of your life. If a person has 1 hour to spare every day of his life, how much time has someone else wasted?\nInput: In a year, a person has used approximately 2.0*365 = 11,788 minutes of time out of his life.\nIf one hour out of every year is wasted, the total lost time is 1106 minutes.\nMultiply the time that person has lost to work by 11,788 minutes (or 0.02*365*18 = 26.56 hours).\nThis works out to a loss of 26,56 hours every year!\nThis is 11,788 times 26,56 hours = > 2.6 million hours wasted every year.\nHow much time has someone else needed to waste up to this point in his life?\n\nInput: A man and woman in the middle of a large city are going about their daily chores. The man picks up a garbage can with two overflowing garbage bags in it. When asked why he is carrying two garbage bags, he answers that he was told to carry two by his wife. Can you get that out of him?\nOutput: On days the man is expected to get two garbage bags full, it will take him an average of 2.26 hours to go from 0 to 60. On days when he is expected to get one garbage bag full but has to get the bags from the other end of the city, it will take him 2 minutes longer.\nThe man is therefore wasting 2 million hours per year.\nMultiply his lifetime hours of waste by 1/(365)*2 = 6,000 hours lost per year*365 = 930,000 hours per year.\nThis works out to about $90 million annually in lost productivity. This is 930,000 hours lost that people could have been spending on productive activities instead!\nMultiply the hours lost per year by 1/(365)*3 = 42,000 hours of lost productivity!\nThis works out to $4 million of the total $90 million in lost productivity.\nMultiply that by $90,000,000 each year and you have a total of $3,000,000", "answer": "A: headache"}

{"text": "The answer is D.\n\nInput: The house I bought has 15 rooms and I have two bedrooms.  My room is 6'x6' with a window that lets in the first 3 inches of daylight.  The room I rent is the size of a walk-in closet. The window lets out about 4' of daylight, but the closet lets in only 1' of daylight if I push in the closet door.  The first 3 inches of daylight gets reflected in the closet window giving me about 4/5th of the morning light.  The second 3 inches get reflected in the closet window.

When he comes out of the bathroom, the first people he looks at are his wife and two kids. When the man passes the two kids and talks to his wife, his wife notices that he looks so much younger than she has ever seen him in her life.  What happens?\nOutput: When the man walks in, he does not say anything to his wife or children. However, when he makes the sign of the cross, his wife looks at him so much differently than she has ever seen her before. This is because her brain cannot tell the differences between the man's age, and his age, and his age. Therefore, she thinks he was younger when he first came into the bar.\nThus, he looks significantly younger when he first walks in than when he first comes out of the bathroom because his brain does not want to put the two images together.

The annual contract cost is $10,000.  The monthly payment is $1,000.  Let's say that there is $200 each month in the beginning and a $1,000 each month in the end.  Therefore monthly payments are $20,000/15 = $40,000/15 = 6,000.\nOutput: A\nIf you calculate that $40,000 / 60000 = 5 x 6 = $5,000, that money has been paid out as follows: (5 x $5,000) = $150\nThe total payment to the client at the end of the contract is $55,000 or 5 x 50 = $50,000\nSo the total payment to the client for the last month is $50,000 or 5/50 = $25,000\nThe total payment to client for the last year is $25,500 or 5/50 = 25,500\nSo the total payment for one year by the client amounts to $5,500+5,000=15,500\nThe total payment of one year is 15,500 less the total payment of 8,000\nSo the client has paid $15000 less than it was supposed to pay and the total contract cost was only $100,000. The amount of money the client will pay each month will be $20,000 less than it was promised to pay. So the total contract costs will be: 100+50+15000=170,000\nThe total contract cost: $ 170,000\nTotal payment: $100,000 divided by 8,000 = $50\n\nInput: A customer wants to buy a new truck for $7,000.

{"text": "I like these choices. But I think the best answer is a combination of A and D.\nHere are the choices and the way they look like:\nA:TimeB: BoredomC: TimeD: Time\nTo illustrate this I will give them an example: A. A student is bored after 9 1/2 hours of studying on paper in front of him. B. A teacher wants to punish the student in the class by giving him a choice of going home to his parents or a substitute teacher for one hour and then he will come back to study in the classroom. C. A student wants to leave the class to go to the park to play for 10 minutes. D. A student wants to go home to his family and then come back to the class to work a little more.\nThe above answers look like below.\nI think the best answer is the combination of A and B.\nThis way it's easy to explain to children what is happening. Children also like to put names to certain things.\nAnd I think it's good that children understand that teachers have to plan and prepare for a long period.\nLet's pick another example.\nLet's say you need a lot of energy.\nYou may like this answer: C. As soon as I open my eyes I see a bird floating in the sky and then I notice it seems to be circling near me and it seems like it is flying. D. As soon as I am awake, I go out and find the bird on a hill and while I am taking some photos of it, I hear a hummingbird singing in a tree near me.\nAgain, I think the best answer was C.\nThis way the child is taught that it is important to rest. We need to eat for this energy to get a good night's sleep.\nAnd it also makes sense that the child is excited by it. We need to make sure that we get enough sleep, not only when we are young.\nSo, for example, the student starts out by studying all day but after a couple of hours the energy runs out and he has to rest. If he stays in the classroom all of the time, it will be hard for him to keep the energy up. He just needs to relax and enjoy the day with his family.\nAnd I think this explains the way children feel that teachers are preparing and preparing for a long period. They also need rest to keep up with a long period.\nSo, for me, I", "answer": "B: patience"}

{"text": "If the car has an impact or a backache, the car might slide down on a small rock where it meets a large boulder. If the car crashes, the car will hit a small tree where the tree meets a large tree, so neither impact would do much damage to the car. The car could also get tired and slow down in its path, but there would be no pain caused by this.\nOutput: If the vehicle has an accident or the car crashes, there would be much more risk of the vehicle sliding from its intended position due to the lack of an impact or backache.  The car would take a much longer amount of time to get to its intended position, and there would be more risk of the vehicle getting tired and slipping to its intended position due to this situation.

Therefore, it was the number on the left hand column. Therefore, it was on the top row of that row. Therefore, it was in the middle column. Therefore, it is the number on the center column. Since it is the 7th item on the center row, it should be the left hand column. By looking at the first 4 rows, this table shows the direction that it is suppose to be read in. If the number 1 is in the right hand column and the 7 is in the left hand column, the 6th row would be considered the top row. Also, since the first 4 rows are the top row, the 7th row would be the bottom row. The 6th row was the top row, so the top row would be the left hand column in that case. And since the first 4 rows were the top row, the 6th row which has 7 was the bottom row. You could also consider 7 as the first column (bottom of the 4th row) and the 5th item being numbered 0.\n\nInput:On Wednesday night you get up in the middle of the night with a terrible stomachache.

How much you will lose in loss due to the check's return is $10,400 and $1000 of which is lost on the check refund. There are two ways to reduce this loss. The first is by using an interest-bearing checking account and the second is by transferring money into your savings account and putting some money away. Your bank's deposit policy should be determined by your bank. If none of you has a checking account, there is a large benefit of a savings account. The savings account is also a good place where you deposit cash after you make a purchase. However, the risk for failure is that the bank will not deposit the money back into your checking acct. after a bank holiday or when you open an IRA, because there is no way for the bank to know it is you. You can also deposit large sums of money into your IRA so you don't have to keep it in an account.

Each of your animals takes 3 hours to produce an adult male. What is the time it takes 1 cow to produce an adult male?\nOutput: From 3 cows, 1 chicken, 1 pig and 1 pig, it takes 8 hours.\nIf only one of the animals takes 3 hours, it takes an additional 4 hours to produce an adult, which is 6 hours total.\nTherefore, 8 * 3 * 2 + 2 * 4 = 16 hours to produce an adult.\nSo the total time required for 1 cow to produce an Adult is 16 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 4 = 48 hours to produce an Adult male.\nLet us say instead that 1 cow takes 4 hours, leaving 7 hours in total. We now have 11 cows and 10 pigs. Therefore, 11 * 4 = 56 cows and 10 pigs. If we start with 9 cows and 10 porkers, it takes an additional 1 hour, taking the total to 17.\nInput: 1 cow gives 1 cow and 1 pig gives 1 pig.

Its diameter is 11 times the earth's diameter but its distance from Earth is only 70,000 miles.  How many hours have the moon been in this range?\nOutput: If it is now in perigee, it would be 0 - 70,000 - 11 = <<70,000 + 11=300>>300 hours\nSince the moon is 7.9 earth diameters away, we can figure out roughly how many hours after a specific position the moon reaches the position that we are describing.\nSince 0 - 70,000+11 = 300 > 70,000, we can use the formula formula = 3*log(0.0 + 0.7*log(1)*log(1)+... + log(0.007))/log(0.00+0.007), where 0.0 is 0 hours ago and 0.007 is 70,000,000 minutes ago.\nSince we know that the first option C will always be correct, then the formula will be:\n\n3*log10(70,000*180) + log(180/330)*log6(0.0+0.7) / log(0.00+1)</td>\n\nThus for 0<70,000 > 70,000=2.29\nSo the formula will be 5/7 - 2.29 = 2.2\n\nInput: What does a person who goes shopping do?

The math is identical for all of them..\nIf you divide 2 grain into four equal portions, you have one grain in each portion.\nHowever if you divide 4 grain into 4 equal portions, you have two grains in each portion.\nIf you divide 8 grain into four equal portions you have one grain in the first, one grain in the second, one grain in the third and so on.\nThis is why the answers are almost equal.\nIf you divide 100 grain into 400 grains you have 8 grains in each portion. If you divide 400 grains of grains into 2000 grains you will have 4000 grains of grains.\nEach grain is equal in value. So there would be no difference in how you divide each portion of a grain in 4 equal portions or in 8 equal portions.\nTherefore since the answer for 7 grain is the same whether it's in 4 equal portions or 8 equal portions, it also applies to 4 grain, 8 grain, and 1000 grain.\nEach grain is equally worth it in terms of the amount of it in each portion.

{"text": "To keep the balloons from blowing away, the store requires that its employees wear their shirts inside out. Therefore, employees are often dressed \"up\" in shirts. The shirts may be black or blue, and may bear either a large or a small company logo.\nIn each case, the shirt must be inside-out because the shirts are so tightly packed and tightly sealed. Otherwise, if anyone of the shirts were to wear it outside, it would be very difficult to get the shirt back inside.\nIn fact, most stores only allow their employees to wear shirts inside-out. If they wore outside-out shirts it would look like they were taking all of the extra fabric into their own shirts. Since there is very little money left over after purchasing the clothes (at most stores) they cannot afford to pay their employees to wear their shirts outside-out. Therefore, the employees are kept \"inside\" the shirt, and are \"outside\" the shirt. They are thus \"up\" in shirts and wearing up in shirts.\nThere is no standard term in the English language in which the word \"up\" is used to refer to \"inside out.\"\nInput: The average salary for the most recent quarter is ______\nOutput: $10,000.\nThe average salary for the last quarter was $7,000.\nLetters of credit do not require a cash deposit because, under the Federal Reserve System set up by Congress in 1971, an amount of cash is only required if the cash advances were less than $10,000, and even then only if the advanced amount was less than $1,000. Therefore, if the Federal Reserve Board or a member of the Federal Reserve Board is issuing a letter of credit on a loan application, they are not required to have a cash deposit and only require a $10,000 cash advance. Therefore, if employees request a letter of credit from a bank on an individual loan application at a particular interest rate of the lender's choice, it does not require a cash deposit.\nThe Federal Reserve Board, with its limited authority, is unlikely to issue a loan without a cash deposit. Employees who request a letter of credit are required by their supervisors to have cash on hand for the deposit.\nTherefore, the average salary paid to employees is 12% more than the average salary of the last quarter.\nBut that assumes that salaries are constant over the years.

She goes through customs at New York, is processed and moves on to Chicago. She passes over a bridge and sees a car.  On the bridge's leftside, Alice notices a pedestrian crossing.  Alice decides it is safer to cross that bridge than the pedestrian crossing.  When she hits the bridge's edge, she falls in the river that flows north-south, then comes to rest in the middle of the bridge.

The following day a friend of the victim sent him a copy of a newspaper article with the headline, \"One black man murdered, 20 black men arrested\". This leads into a discussion on the case in class. Which group of people said what?\nOutput: The 2 guys in class talked about the case in class the entire week. They both said the following:\n\"If it was black on black crime, we can't get involved. He shot at his cousin, not anyone else\".\n\"The guy in the article was probably a crackhead, maybe a drug dealer.

Three times three is $150 million. You sell one cow at the end of 18 months, for its market value, and you buy one cow back at the end of 18+18+18+18+.  Now your cow's worth is $30 million divided into three $30 million times three, times two cows' market value, and times one cow at the end.  What is your profit?\nOutput: $120,000+ $120,000+\nSo with three cows, your net profit would have been $120,000 - $120,000 = $60,000, or $90 per cow to raise.\n\nInput:If two trees are 10 cm apart on the same branch, each one is 120cm in height, and they are standing at the same height on the same branch and are 5 cm apart, how far apart do the branches have to be for you to get from one tree to the other?\nOutput: There are 120cm - 10cm - 5cm + 5cm - 10cm = 150cm. So your two trees and their branches are at the same distance from one another when standing 6 and 3.5 meters away.\nWith 7 meters you have the distance to move the branch between your two trees at the same time. So 7+9+12 +24=31\nSo your two trees are 3 meters apart. You have two trunks at least equal in height of each and they stand three meters away from one another. With six meters you have the distance between the two trees with one tree and one trunk at the center of the distance between your two trees. So 6+7+15+19+23=34", "answer": "E: cellar"}

Thus it means that one less day off over the summer.\nSince the two kids will now be in school 9 hours each day, his work load is twice as much. So instead of 6 hours per week for the kids, he'll be pulling in 9 hours for them.\nSince two kids will be going to school every day, he wont be coming home much on weekends.

Then one of the boys comes along with a ball, and the girls are able to catch his ball. How many balls do every player get to throw?\nOutput: The only change is that each girl gets to catch one ball, and one ball each to throw.\nTherefore each player gets one ball, and they can both catch it. So only one ball stays on the field between every player throwing, which is counted as a goal by the teacher. This is then marked as a goal. Since each girl is also able to catch the ball, she must have one ball, and each boy must have 2 balls.\nTherefore there are 7 balls in the class...8 if you count the 2 balls which the male player throws.\nWhich means there are now 11 balls in the class...12 if you count the 2 boys who throw.\n\nThis question is in a logic block and answers should be written in the most logical sequence possible with correct sentence structure.\n\nThe way I see it, the following is the most logical answer, however, my teacher gave me the wrong answer.

The person has never ate shrimp before. He has been told that he should cut the shrimp in half to get 2 servings, but 1 serving is two bites, and 2 bites takes the same amount of time as 1 bite. How much shrimp can the person eat in 20 minutes?\nOutput: The shrimp can be eaten individually or in a buffet. Each of the six shrimp can be served individually in a buffet, or each one can be given in a buffet setting. It is not possible to have one bite and have it count as a serving of shrimp, since one bite is 2 bites. Therefore, each individual can have 2 servings, but 2 is more than 1. So 2*20=<<2*20=300>>300 shrimp.\nThe number of shrimp in each serving is dependent on which direction the person is facing. On the flat side of the plate, all 6 shrimp can be served. The shrimp would be served with a dipping sauce that is on the top of the plate for four shrimp and the bottom of the plate for one shrimp.

{"text": "If I recieve a letter, why did I not get news or strain? Pudding, get news, strain, answer, though,\n\nInput: For the past two decades, the Earth has been producing more of its own oxygen than it can consume, and that surplus has put it dangerously out of balance. At any given moment at sea the ocean can contain roughly 0.8% more oxygen than is necessary to sustain life. However, this oxygen content has not even remotely maintained a constant amount. Over the last century, the total oxygen produced in the world oceans has fluctuated wildly, rising and falling by at least 200 ppm. How did this come about and is it permanent? How does the Earth return to equilibrium, and what should we do to take this into account?  Answers:\nA: Earth's atmosphere was formed when oxygen was produced throughout the Earth's history. Oxygen has a stable limit that can only be exceeded by adding new molecules. By far the largest contributor to this new oxygen is from man and the fossil fuels that we produce. Since this oxygen is so highly reactive it is stored up in the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere, and even today, most of the world's oxygen is held in this upper layer. If we stopped pumping oxygen into the atmosphere then it would quickly disappear, and Earth's oxygen-saturation level would return to its pre-fossil-fuel levels in no time.\nB: There is no long-term trend in the amount of oxygen produced by humanity. We have been pumping lots of oxygen, even when the Earth was much more stable than it is today, but we have also been pumping lots of carbon dioxide too. It is possible, though, that our production of carbon dioxide is going down.\nC: It is known as 'the bubble'. It was most likely caused by the combination of global warming and ocean acidification. Ocean acidification occurs when atmospheric CO2 levels were low enough that the oceans had more time to buffer changes in the Earth's carbon chemistry. When atmospheric CO2 levels begin to climb again, there could be a repeat of the bubble if we keep pumping oceans with carbon dioxide.\nD: It is important to keep in mind that the amount of CO2 produced in the Earth's atmosphere is currently limited by the amount that is produced from fossil fuels. When climate shifts, as it has several times during the last 5 million years, it is difficult to avoid a change in Earth's oxygen-saturated levels.\nE: The Earth", "answer": "B: get news"}

This is because the number of consecutive days with a change of 30*10<> 10<> 5<> 10 will be zero.\nSo the final average minimum temperature in January will be 0*30*10-5.5 <> 10 <> 5 = 20\n\nInput: At what age do men start to get bigger?

At 24 year old, every year young women get bigger than young men. At 32 year old, every year old women get bigger than 32 year old men.\nSo every year men will be 2.65 times the size of 12 year old females, and women will be 2.45 times the size of 17 year old males.\nSo the final male age will be 2.65 * 12 = 4.95\nSo the final female age will be 2.45 * 17 = 4.95\n\nInput: In October, December and January, the temperature is 30 degrees.

If the deaf person dances, then that person has to be quiet.\nIf the deaf musician dances, the deaf musician must be quiet.\nIf you ask how hard a deaf person would have to work to put on the same amount of physical activity as the deaf person who sings the song for the deaf people, then the hard work of the deaf musician is not worth his or her salary. But not much would be the difference between your salary and the salary of a deaf music student without his or her skills. So the hard work of the hearing musician is much more valuable in his or her field than that of the deaf music student, whose job is limited by ear deafness instead of hearing loss.\nOutput: The work to look at, smile at, and sing are considered to be the hardest tasks in the world of music. Thus, all other tasks in this list are easier.\nInput: A lot of people say: \u201cIt\u2019 is hard to be deaf.\u201d They usually mean that it is hard to be hard-headed.\nOutput: If an extremely hard-headed person is deaf, then deaf people cannot be hard-headed.

The speed limit is 100 yards. The star has 4 suns and 4 planets, and the ship is at the center of one of the suns. How many miles can the ship be from the sun? The answer was 5.\nOutput: The ship can be about five lightyears away and still land on the same planet as in the same direction, but only 1 lightyear off. Because the stars are at such different distances (the planets orbiting one another and the star orbiting the sun), it is impossible for the ship to land on all four planets.

We will solve this later.\nOutput: In total, a total of 35 statues should be in the front Garden.\nLet's divide these 35 statues in different ways. Divide the number of statues found in the building by 18 to get the number of statues. Divide 486000 by 24 to get the number of people. Divide 35 by 12 to get the number of statuette we have per person. Divide 30 by 72 to get the number of the statues per person. Finally, divide 15 by 6 to get the number of seconds in a half hour.

If possible, the person should hide in a nearby house where there is a safe place. If this is not an option, he would try to contact someone he knows in the house because the chances of being approached by the police are likely to be high when in the woods.\nIn case the trip is successful, the person should then try to contact a doctor to see if he can get help in replacing his leg or if he can get help with his injuries.\nIf the person's own house is far away from where he is injured and could not provide help, then he should contact a local hospital to see if they have a surgical center that could assist with a replacement, however, unless there is a serious financial barrier, he could hire someone to help with the cost.\nWhen he is able to replace his leg or get help with the cost associated with replacing his arm, he could then contact his employer, discuss his injury, and see if they would be willing to pay him for the lost work until he gets his own money back.\nIf his injury and the money he receives from the family cannot pay for him to become healthy again, then he may look for", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

They both would get all of the items.  In this case, you would then have an even number of gifts. Which gift would you then have to do all the work?\nSolution: Each must get an item and put it on their own person. They each then have to get an item and put that on their own person again. This means that each must either get 2 gifts if they want to or only get 3 gifts and one must do all the work. They must pick out an item from the same person. If they don't pick the same item, they must put someone else's gift on their own person.  The remaining 2 gifts must be given back to that person.  In these cases, you end up with four.   In this case, the last gift has to be given to the last person in line, and this will take time. You could let someone behind you in line get a gift for them. In this case, it just saves having someone be with a person behind them in line, which makes no real difference. Also, when you give gifts to someone behind you in line, they will also have to wait for things if you have to get ready for the party to start. Since each must get an item and have to wait for their turn, each of those gifts can take time and is therefore pointless. The only one who can make a difference is their present and time. In this case, the least amount of work is that person who must get their own present. This person can then spend some time doing whatever.\n\nInput: Suppose you have a large herd.

Thus, the total amount of food eaten is 34 + 33 = 40 hours. The total amount of food consumed is thus 40 * 34 = 320 lbs.\nSo the final amount of food consumed is 320 * 33 + 40 = 820 lbs.\nSo the total amount of food consumed would be 820 * 32 + 330 * 35 = 820 lbs.\nIf you can eat a total of 820 lbs, you will be able to find the maximum weight of the total weight of food you have eaten.\nSo that would be the maximum weight of the maximum weight of food you have ever eaten.\n\nInput: What is five more than three times the number to the right of the number 9?

{"text": "We all want to make certain people sick so that they cannot do anything stupid. The only way to do that is to limit the amount of people in society. And we do that with the idea that each person is important and must have some place to live.   What we forget to address, however, is that each individual cannot possibly be able to be responsible for every need of every single person in society. So we simply need to create some sort of governance to make certain that no one is left unfulfilled.  This governance needs to be strong enough not only to be effective, but also to be sustainable.\nLet's look at the population of the United States, in general. We've got a population of 300 million and we could probably divide the population into two groups: 1) the 100 million Americans who enjoy being free from government interference and 2) the 100 million Americans for whom freedom is an absolute luxury, and for whom the government must be there to act as though it never was. The government cannot act as though it's never been, because as far as people like us are concerned, the government is already there. This does not make us free in the least. It makes us miserable, and we are not willing to sacrifice ourselves in order to provide the government with what it is incapable of providing for us. And so at some point in American history a \"revolution\" will probably begin.  This revolution will involve one or another government agency attempting to overthrow the government. At that moment, however, the people will know that there is no way they can ever be free from government at a point like this. So I imagine that about that time the people will decide to create government agencies. They will then not only be able to provide for themselves, but will also be able to provide for the people who do not enjoy freedom. At that point, society will be strong enough to sustain itself without government, for those who are not at that point in time in society.   There will be no need for an agency created by the government to provide for those who simply would not otherwise have the ability to provide for themselves. And so we will be able to exist.\nOutput: It requires 300 million people in society to govern 300 million people. So society as we know it will come crashing down at that moment in time. But the people who are most able to provide for themselves and to take care of themselves will be able to do so. After all, if 300 million people can make their own choices in the face", "answer": "B: populated area"}

In the morning, John took the hotel trolley around the lake to the town's only restaurant and a bar.\nIn the afternoon, John walked around town a little bit.  The restaurant seemed ok.  They had $5 hamburgers.  The bar had cheap drinks and lots of games.  John picked up 2 more burgers and paid $1 for each hamburger.  He also had some beers.  He decided to park there and went walking around.  The restaurant was very crowded and noisy with people.  He sat at the bar for another couple of minutes and watched TV.\nOn the way home, John stopped at a garage that sold cars and trucks.  He bought a used '73 Corvette for $1,300 for Saturday night.  This seemed expensive on Saturday night.  He returned to his car around 10:30, and only made it to his house in time for supper.  Sunday was a good day.  John took a boat ride on the lake.  After lunch, he and his dad drove around the rest of the lake until they could no longer see the boat going the wrong way.  John called around again.  The boat rental place was full and wouldn't let him pay for anything else.  He tried to find some other deal for a different boat, but nothing came.  Finally, around 1:00 PM, John left the lake and headed home.\n\nInput: Bill and Peggy both had large bills to pay when they got to school on Monday.  Bill didn't have a dime.

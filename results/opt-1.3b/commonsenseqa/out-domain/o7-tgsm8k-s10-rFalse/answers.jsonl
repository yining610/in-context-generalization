The person behind the wheel must walk 100 miles on her way home for every litre of gas consumed. If 100 liters of gas is consumed per hour, the distance covered at 5 miles per gallon is 600 miles.  If the car travels at 100 miles per hour at a normal speed (i.e. 40 MPH), the distance covered at 100 miles per hour is 600 feet, or about 30 feet per second.

The price of the meat is $14, with a 2.3$ profit margin. The price per pound can be determined by multiplying the volume of the animal by the number of pounds. The profit margin is 2.3+4.13, which gives a profit margin of 1.2 cents per pound. The total profit margin is 14% (2.3c profit margin). The value of the animals is $6,000. The $6,000 you would spend on your vacation includes a $600.00 per person hotel, $400.00 for meals, and $200.00 per person airfare. The cost of a one-week vacation to Barbados is $3,000. The cost of a three-week vacation to Barbado is $2,500. The cost of a four-week vacation is $3,000 and does not include airfare. So a one-week vacation is $6,000, a three-week vacation is $2,500, a four-week vacation costs $3,000 and a four-week vacation includes airfare. So each person travels on an average of 100 miles - a cost of $40.00 and the cost of a car is $20.00, giving an average cost of $95.50 per person.

When you can only buy 50 containers of fruit at a single time, the weekly cost of fruit increases, and this is the amount Mary saves. If the cost of fuel goes up 5% per year, we can conclude that she saves $200 per year. We need to take the above into account when we calculate Mary's savings from reducing her food box count from 5 to 2.\nOutput: 890\n\nInput: John is working out at the gym for an hour 3 times a week.

Have 1 person with an average life expectancy of 80 years; 2. Have 2 persons with an average life expectancy higher than 80 years; 3. If 1 couple has an average life expectancy of 60 years, the couple must have been married twice.  The number of citizens of one state (or country) is equal to that nation's average life expectancy, if it meets these criteria.  The number of states that do not meet this criteria is equal to the number that do not meet the criteria that applies in the state for which the citizens of that state are residents.  If the percentage difference between the average life expectancy and the average life expectancy of neighboring states is greater than that of the state which meets the above criteria, the state is not a union.  States that do not meet the criterion are not union states.

This statement is false: Every beer in the store has different price.  This statement can be checked by using the tautological fact that there is only one price for a beer, the price you drink that beer.  This statement is true only if you are drinking that beer: You would have to add a little to each number to make them add up to $3.  So there is a possibility that every 100% beer cost $2.  This statement can also be checked using the fact that you would need to buy that particular beer to understand what the price was.  So there is the chance that it is $2 or $3 and not $2 and not $3 or $2 and not $2 or $2.  This is true because $2.50 sounds like $3.

For example, in the first, second, and third questions, you do use the word \"teacher\", but for answers about students. In the third, your answer is \"student teacher\", and is followed by the word *in the fourth question. That should be \"student\". If in the following you are going to use the word \"student\"... it won't really be a student question since it really should be answered in the fourth question.\n\nAlso, I would consider the other answers in the second question to be just as \"hard\" as \"student\" questions.

Which drink comes in the last place on the list of choices?\nOutput: B\n\nInput:(Select the answer that best describes the problem and the best solution.)(This was a very good example of multi-choice questions.)\nInput(Select the Answer that best describes the problem.)\nInput: How do the numbers indicate the price of different foods?\nOutput: If the percentage of milk comes at the top, the price of a single glass of milk should exceed the price of a large bag of milk.\nInput: How many cups of liquid are in a one-liter bottle?\nOutput: 8\n\n[Correct answer]\n2.\n\nTo answer this question, you first need to understand how to do multiple choice questions. Here are some basic rules (in no particular order):\n\nYour answers are supposed to make sense. And they should make sense to the audience with the multiple choice question as a whole.\n\nYour answer should also give an explicit logical relationship to the question. This is true in the sense that if you didn't give your answer based on the question, you are committing a logical fallacy and you should revise to show a relationship or state it in a way that tells the reader or listener what it means. For example, if you gave your answer \"A and B\" instead of \"A and B\", you may be committing a logical fallacy, because \"A and B\" can be an either/or statement and either \"A\" or \"A and B\" have not two different meanings. For example, if I told you that the price of milk was $2.00, you could have an idea that the answer could be both \"A and B\"! And you could have also said things like \"B and C\" and not necessarily \"A and B\" or just \"B\"!\n\nA logical fallacy is a fallacy in logic which says that an argument is logically invalid because it is not necessarily true, since it differs from the actual truth or falsity of the argument. For example, if what you said said that the temperature in the room was 25\u00b0C and you said \"It's 33.3\u00b0C outside\", then you are committing a logical fallacious statement (in a sense that you are saying an argument is not necessarily true because you did not give a reason why it is true/false) because \"It", "answer": "B: try to learn"}

If you stop eating in the first couple of days, the second day you can eat three times as normally as before.   If you start eating again after the first few days, you will almost reach the same level as before you stopped eating.   The same applies if you stop eating after the second days.   If you eat again after the second week, you need about 1/8 as much food to reach your normal level, and if you eat again after the third week you need about 1/4 as much food to get to your normal level.

How do I find out which variable will be less likely to change? That is, let x be the number of votes for A and y be the number of votes given to X. Since I want y to be less valuable than A (since A must have a greater number of votes), let c be the time length between A and B. If time L is sufficient, then (where x = B) c must be sufficiently long. Let Q be the total number of votes for A, and let r be the total number of times Y wins over A.  (I know that each time Y wins I get fewer points, because X votes are less valuable and the number q of times Y wins is much larger.) Then what am I going to do with y? What I will do with it (in fact, you can't determine this for yourself, but you must learn what you will do with it) is determine the value of Y.  Since an x-value is always greater than an odd integer, and Y must be greater than, say, the number 1, you can put Y at a position in the range r/r+1 such that y /= y.  That is, suppose the value of y = 10.  In that case, we will put r at position 3 of the range.  This value of r in position 3 will be different than the value of y = 9, because r/r+1 is different from 0.\nOutput: 2\n\nInput:Let's say I've decided I want to find out what a person's IQ is by measuring his/her reaction times.

He has a few stops along the way, so how about he estimates the total trip time?\nOutput: 45\n\nInput: One hour of a person\u2019s free time is an amount of time that the person spends on a fixed amount of activity as opposed to moving around.  For each hour of a person\u2018s free time you can find the value as:  a(1 + a(0 + a(1 + a()))))/2  a(1 + 2a(0.5 - 0.25)?/2  a(2 + a[0.25 - 0.5 - 0.5]])/2\nExample:\nThe total free time of a person is 9.5 hours of the year.  Let\u2018s assume that the person occupies 8 hours of those minutes of free time and another 2 hours of free time per day.  Therefore the total free time of a day is 13 hours.  The total free time of a week is 40 hours.  Therefore the total time of a year is 240 hours and the time of the year is 20 days.  Therefore the total number of hours a year is 9,880 hours, which is the number of hours that a person needs to complete the daily tasks of living.\nExample:\nThe work time of a person is 10 hours a day.  He wakes up, does some chores, gets breakfast and goes to his work.  Each day he takes a further 5-10 minutes to eat breakfast, go to the bathroom, go to work, and go back home.  Therefore each day, his free time is 4 hours.  Therefore the hours he is free during the day during the year is 28 hours.  Since the total number of hours spent in a day is 9,880, the hours he is free are 60, and there are 7 days per year.  Therefore it takes him 36 hours to complete his daily tasks plus the time he is free during the days. Therefore since the total number of hours of his free time is 5,000 hours, his free time is 40 hours.  Since the days constitute a year, the total number of hours is 60. Therefore 30 months is 18,000 hours.\nExample:\nA person needs 20 hours per day to get enough sleep.  The only other activity he can perform during that period is a little bit of browsing of the internet during the time", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

In contrast he wrote that, \u201cMy own theory was this: no matter how the elements were arranged in the universe, they were going to reproduce randomly and eventually, in a sort of organic dance, reproduce their original arrangement, so that every living thing looked like its own individual and nothing like anything else.\u201d  His comments were received with wide disfavor, but one biochemist defended him by insisting that not once had Darwin taken into account that his own experiment did not produce the same random chemical reaction that evolution had created.  Other experiments have revealed that the rate at which biological reactions reproducibly reproduce was never the same in a group of organisms that Darwin himself was part of. Is this discrepancy due to the laws of nature or due to Darwin\u2019s own theories? This paper presents experiments revealing whether the rate of reproduction is the same for both of these two types of experiments. We suggest that the explanation lies in their methodologies as much as the fact that the organisms on both of these experiments are living cells.\n\nInput: In 1968 John Lennon met with the producer Brian Epstein, the publisher Ian McLean, and his friend Yoko Ono.

The first child that chooses not to eat the candy can hold out his hand.  The child who gives the candy bar all his choices is the candy bar winner.  If the first child takes the candy bar, the child who took the candy bar cannot eat the candy bar in future sessions.

A good place to start is to ask questions in the other sections of the book and then go from there.  By the time you are done with the book, you should be well on your way to creating your own personal business plan.  If you ever have the opportunity to create your own business plan, ask these questions:\nHow will you make money?\nWho is your customer?\nWho is your market?\nWho will help you make money?\nWhat is your competitive advantage?\nHow will you create value for your customers/customers' customers?\nWhy should you do this?\nHow will you solve the problems that face your market?\nWhat will you do differently?\nHow will you change what works?\nIn the next few weeks, keep track of all the things you are writing down.  The more you create an idea with a customer in mind, the more likely is it you will find an answer.  Eventually, you will put together a solid business plan on your own.\nAfter you do what you just wrote, put that blueprint on paper.  You will come up with business cards, postcards, emails, e-mail newsletter templates, blog posts, and business plans.  This is not easy. Writing an idea with a customer will make it seem simple because the idea is simple. However, when you have a strong idea with customers in mind, it puts things into perspective that you just couldn't imagine.  I like to say that when I write the book on business, it's like writing what I think a child should understand, not what their teacher should teach.\nAs I said before, the business plan will not automatically become reality.  You will still have to go out and do a lot more research than to create something that people will want to buy from you.  After you have a business plan", "answer": "C: body armor"}

When Tim went to bed a few hours later, Daniel was still working. What was Tim\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s workload for their first night? Output: 4\n\nInput / Output:\nInput A) John went to the gym 1/2 the week before and worked out 2 hours per day.  Additionally, he worked out during the day as well as at night. On one particular day, John worked out hard for 8 hours, then went to bed at 10 pm. In the evening, Daniel went to bed at 3 am. He woke up at 10 pm with a great buzz that lasted the entire night. In the morning, the rest of John\u2019s workout was done, Daniel\u2019s was not, and he started to work out hard right away. On the two days that John actually worked out that week, he worked out for 7 hours, slept for another 6 hours, and worked out for 2 hours in the evening. On the two days Daniel actually worked out that week\u2014a rare and unexpected event\u2014he worked out for 5 hours and slept 7 hours and worked out for 2.5 hours in the evening. If John\u2019s workload the week he worked out was the average for the other two weeks, then his workload the year before was the average for the entire year. If Daniel\u2019s workload the year before was average for the other two years, then his workload the next year would be the average. Since there have only been two such years in the history of the NFL, Daniel\u2019s workload would be expected to be on average for the years that he worked out. If it was expected, then Daniel\u2019s workload in the year that he will work out would also be on average for the two years that he will work out. So, Daniel would be working out on average for five years; the average would be five years; and the year that he will not work out would be on average. Therefore, by Daniel\u2019s calculation of the average for his two year-old year, his workload the week after he will work", "answer": "C: bound"}

An example would be a human flock. There are plenty of other animals living in the rainforest, so a human flock may be more common than one would expect. At the same time, some creatures seek shelter out from other groups, so birds usually gather. At night, the rainforest is not that brightly lit, which makes most people more likely to stay in a group (a flock) than in the dark (one person alone). Thus, when a large group meets, that group sometimes looks like it is crowded.\n\nInput:A\n\nInput:A horse can be taught to walk by using signals, which are different for each individual.

Their employers are both at home and therefore cannot observe the men at work. However, because one of the men is a bus driver, both employers witness the men at work and will know which of them is the bus driver. The men do not wish to tell their employers the other's location so they decide to keep their own workstation. Since one of them drives the bus, his station is not near his employer. When the men get to work, they find that no one else uses the station near their employer. Therefore, they decide to hide their station. They do so for three hours and when they see no one using the station they decide to leave. When they do so, they see that all the other men who have previously hidden their stations have also left. They then start to worry that their employer may start looking for them. Therefore, they decide that the man who is driving the bus should go to his own station. He decides to put his station at his employer's place and drive it for three hours. However, when he gets out of the station there is nowhere to park so he decides to spend all the money he has saved for gasoline and buy a bus. When he gets there, he finds that at his new station he has exactly the same workstation that he had at the other station.\nSince neither man wanted to tell their employers which of them was the bus driver, they only pretended to be leaving. However, to prove that they know which one is the bus driver, they decide to put their station near their employer. This station then becomes their boss' workstation. When their employer, having been convinced that the men have hidden their own stations, sees this station and sees that it is exactly the same one as their own station, his suspicion is confirmed. Therefore, he assumes that they have been there three hours and assumes that they have not used the station near their employer in that time. Therefore, he immediately begins to search for them and finds that they have been using his station and have been there for three hours. Therefore, he then has suspicions and starts to search for them.

They both score 100 points and go on to compete in a three round contest. After a long day of competition the teachers evaluate who took up the best positions in each round (in terms of the score they scored against the competition and overall grade they scored). As a result, the teacher determines the winner of this contest by determining who scored the best against the three best scores for his or her grade class (and that is that)  In determining the winner in each round, the teacher has to take into account both points scored and points in each category of the contest.  So, for example, if John scored a 1/10 percentile higher than John Smith, John Smith would not have achieved the same place as John.

{"text": "1\n\nIn this lesson you are studying the fact that we know how many hours you spend at home every week and how much money goes to help you. However it can be assumed that you have a few people in your group that do other things for you. In this lesson we will work to answer some questions we are likely to ask. We will begin by having you calculate the hours you spend at your desk and at home every week.\nNumber of hours spent at home\nThe most important answer when estimating the number of hours spent at home every week is how much money is spent per week. The answer is a lot. Each person in your household is spending a lot of money every week, however you may expect that someone may choose to do other things as well. You may find yourself having some friends that you meet at work doing jobs along side you, or sometimes they may help or even become your roommates. This will give you a good idea of where most of your money is going.\nNumber of other people spending money\nIt does not matter how much money you have or how many people you are living with. The main thing to think about when figuring out how many hours you spend are other people spending money. If you think about it most people have someone spending money for them or for them and others that will help them. These are your family and friends. The important thing when doing cost per hour calculations is that each person is spending money on a different task. We can think of the time spent at work or the money the person spends at home, or maybe they like to go out to eat in the evening. The important thing is to get an idea of how much money you each spend by looking at the tasks you each are doing. You can calculate the hours you waste from the time you spend doing certain tasks for one someone else.\nNumber of hours you spend at home\nNumber three is really what you are trying to figure for number two. How much money you each spend at home. Most people spend money in some form of recreation in the form of TV, movie tickets, etc. These are all non-essentials and when considering your cost per hour calculations you can also think about the time the people spend with you. This is not as clear as it could be but, as we see here, most people make up for their money spent at home or at work with social time outside of the house. Some of the most time spent with people is when they are out doing chores and cleaning. You will", "answer": "D: frequent"}
{"text": "[4\n\nOutput: The number of calories lost everyday from a daily diet is between 500 and 1000 calories.  The body of a healthy person weighs 300 pounds, and the body mass index for someone of average weight is between 20 and 25.  If you exercise regularly at that rate, you burn 500 calories.  The caloric loss of an average adult lasts 3.5 days during which 10 pounds is shed.  During the first third of that span, the amount of energy lost will be almost 3,000 calories.  When 2 pounds of energy has been burned, this energy needs to come from some source, and it will be burned in some part or another.  The most likely source is the food that you eat.  If each pound of food that you eat contains 500 calories and you burn 500 calories a day from it, the amount of calories that you burn in a day is 2,100.\nInput: 500\nOutput [4\n\nInput:In a typical basketball game, the two guards guard the middle forward and the two forwards guard the point guard.

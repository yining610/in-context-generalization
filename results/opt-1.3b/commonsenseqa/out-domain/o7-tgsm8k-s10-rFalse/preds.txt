How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: 30<n><n>Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?<n>Output: 868<n><n>Input: Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person.

How many hours did filling the truck take?<n>Output: 6<n><n>Input: Elijah drank 8.5 pints of coffee yesterday. Emilio drank 9.5 pints of water yesterday. How many cups of liquid did the two boys drink yesterday?<n>Output: 36<n><n>Input:What is it called when you slowly cook using a grill? Choices:  A: backyard B: restaurant C: crockpot D: neighbor's house E: barbeque<n>Output:		 A-4<n><n>You can see how this works; you see how your problem is asking you to get from a problem to a sequence of questions. Then ask yourself how to get out of that sequence?<n>Now solve the problem of where is the next question, not the problem itself.<n>So for example, here you can answer the following questions (I gave each one a "5 point" mark):<n>I.A. What are the 6 elements, i.e. the integers, which form the basis of the set R?<n>III.A. I am interested in the function f(x) = f (x) x - x + 1, and I will calculate the area where the function is in continuous space.<n>III.B. If g1 is the derivative of f(x) x - x using a derivative of f(x)*x, how far off does g1 get from x?<n>III.C. Can I find an estimate of the volume of the fluid, called the "bubbles", in which the ball is bouncing?<n>III.D. Are there any questions on which the answer is "no"? I.E. The question is "Can I solve the problem?" not "Why am I even asking the question?"<n>IV.C. Now that we know where the next question belongs, suppose I ask the following question:<n>IV.A. Suppose I am interested in the derivative of f(6) x 2 + 2 of f(2)*x; why is it that I have to solve only one set of questions to find that line?<n>III.D and III.E - no questions on which the answer must be "no".<n><n>How to solve? You start by solving I, just like you started by solving III.<n>Then you solve I. For example:<n>If f(x) x 2 + 2 is a continuous function then:<n>A. f(x) x + x - 1 is equal to f(x) x 3.<n>B. f(x) 3 = -f(x)*x.<n>C. for f(x) x 4 we have:<n>(6.3)<n>The function f is not continuous. So solve I again.<n>Now solve I + B + C and III.D.<n>Then solve I + D + E and III.E + F.<n>So now you are given the "problem"<n>I. A. 3 kg of nuts, 2

The price of the meat is $14, with a 2.3$ profit margin. The price per pound can be determined by multiplying the volume of the animal by the number of pounds. The profit margin is 2.3+4.13, which gives a profit margin of 1.2 cents per pound. The total profit margin is 14% (2.3c profit margin). The value of the animals is $6,000. The $6,000 you would spend on your vacation includes a $600.00 per person hotel, $400.00 for meals, and $200.00 per person airfare. The cost of a one-week vacation to Barbados is $3,000. The cost of a three-week vacation to Barbado is $2,500. The cost of a four-week vacation is $3,000 and does not include airfare. So a one-week vacation is $6,000, a three-week vacation is $2,500, a four-week vacation costs $3,000 and a four-week vacation includes airfare. So each person travels on an average of 100 miles - a cost of $40.00 and the cost of a car is $20.00, giving an average cost of $95.50 per person. So each person can get in car for about $20.00.<n>Output: 4,640<n>________<n><n>Input. The cost of

It used to always be automatic $300 a month, but her ex-husband changed alimony recently so that she has to now make up 100% of the payments. It will be retroactive to his last paycheck, so they will now have to budget more than they think they can afford.  They are currently taking out $1200 a month from their joint account and she has no idea how to budget it effectively when she has to pay a portion.  This is the second major change in their lifestyle in recent months.  Now what?<n>Input: James has decided that she needs a job.  He is going to go to her work and fill out an application today.  He wants to get her her own car so they can stop using her car to get around and pay someone to drive their cars for them.  It should be easier to get money for that if he uses one of her credit cards and then buys a used car on an online resale site than if he starts a new credit line and applies for an unsecured loan.  But the credit score needed to get the car is pretty bad so he will probably have to start out with a less expensive financing option first.  Maybe they should get an income limit for her to qualify so the payment will be smaller.  It also depends how much more interest he can afford.<n>Output: 360<n>Note: She has 2 credit cards at the same interest rate, so the credit line would have to be much larger.<n><n>Input: In a normal state of affairs, a dog would be eaten by wolves if they heard the sound of a gunshot.

For 5 days she will be in the hospital and need 3 of the following medications: a sedative, 4 morphine pills, and muscle relaxants. If she is given only two morphine pills, she should get an 8.5% increase in her chances of survival. If she receives 5 morphine pills, the chances of survival are reduced.<n>Output: 12<n><n>Input:The cost of fuel has increased by 20% since last year, while food prices have gone up by 8% over the same period.

When you can only buy 50 containers of fruit at a single time, the weekly cost of fruit increases, and this is the amount Mary saves. If the cost of fuel goes up 5% per year, we can conclude that she saves $200 per year. We need to take the above into account when we calculate Mary's savings from reducing her food box count from 5 to 2.<n>Output: 890<n><n>Input: John is working out at the gym for an hour 3 times a week.

By the end of the war, there were 19 states, so the number of states went from 100 to 103.  In order for one state to become a union, it must meet 3 of the following criteria: 1. Have 1 person with an average life expectancy of 80 years; 2. Have 2 persons with an average life expectancy higher than 80 years; 3. If 1 couple has an average life expectancy of 60 years, the couple must have been married twice.  The number of citizens of one state (or country) is equal to that nation's average life expectancy, if it meets these criteria.  The number of states that do not meet this criteria is equal to the number that do not meet the criteria that applies in the state for which the citizens of that state are residents.  If the percentage difference between the average life expectancy and the average life expectancy of neighboring states is greater than that of the state which meets the above criteria, the state is not a union.  States that do not meet the criterion are not union states.  The population of the United States was around 300,000,000 when this criterion was met.<n>Input: Where does a state begin and end after reaching 103?<n>Output: Where does a state start and end before reaching 101,99?<n>Output: Where is a state starting and ending and when is it reached?<n>Output: When is a state started and where is the end?<n>output - an outcome of your problem<n><n>Output

This statement is false: Every beer in the store has different price.  This statement can be checked by using the tautological fact that there is only one price for a beer, the price you drink that beer.  This statement is true only if you are drinking that beer: You would have to add a little to each number to make them add up to $3.  So there is a possibility that every 100% beer cost $2.  This statement can also be checked using the fact that you would need to buy that particular beer to understand what the price was.  So there is the chance that it is $2 or $3 and not $2 and not $3 or $2 and not $2 or $2.  This is true because $2.50 sounds like $3.  To check whether the price of beer is $2 or $1, divide all

He looked at the bottle of coffee he had brought from home and found that the lid was missing a cap.  When he opened the lid, half the bottle of coffee spilled out onto the floor. He poured half the spilled half of the bottle into the sink, cleaned up the spilled liquid, and put the lid back on the bottle.  He put a cap on the bottle as well.  At four o’clock, he went to work with a clean shirt. At 5 o’clock, John went to his office again and found his secretary awake. She found his coffee cup in her kitchen and discovered that it was cold and dripping. She put the cup in the sink and discovered that the top of the cup had been broken during the spill.  When he discovered he had broken the top of the cup, he put a towel in the cup and put the coffee cup beside it.  She put a towel in the sink and discovered a puddle of coffee on the towel.  At 7 o’clock, another conference call was held. After the call was finished, John cleaned up the spilled coffee and put the coffee cup next to it. He then took the remaining coffee home and boiled the remaining 1.75 of the 1.75 cup bottle.  He put the water in the cup, added an apple to the cup, stirred the cup, added 2 teaspoons of sugar, and took the cup to work.  At 8:30, Tom brought to the office the remaining cup and showed it John’s wife and office manager. He stated that the cup was not broken during the spill

In the end, the search lasts 4 hours, the man decides he'll wait until dawn to begin his hunt. In the meantime, he goes out to a parking lot to get some air and then to a local bar where he can drink on his diet.  The next day he drives down the same highway trying to find a motel and makes it to the end of the street before deciding there is no motel.  At a second parking lot, he drives out until the truck starts rolling.  He climbs on board, drives to a stop sign and begins to pull over when he hears the muffled sound of an engine.  The truck is already well into the city.  After 5 minutes the pickup truck stops and the driver gets out to inspect the road conditions.  He starts the engine again in the city, drives over a bridge and a railroad track and starts heading back towards where he left off.  He drives at night and eventually ends up on a country road.  He decides to drive to an abandoned hotel at 2AM, not realizing that the hotel was not available after 2:00AM.

When he returns downstairs, he realizes that the fire does not appear to be affecting the area of the house that was set on fire hours ago, suggesting the fire department is not out that night.  He runs out with the fire extinguisher and starts trying to fight the flames with buckets of water.  After 2 hours of fighting, the truck is completely destroyed and he

How many students can it realistically contain? 2. What is the average length of time a child spends each day in school? 3. How many school hours of instruction would the child have to take to satisfy his or her particular learning needs? 4. What is the average number of "hours of instruction" the student would have to work in order to meet his or her particular learning goals?<n><n>The "soft" questions come from questions I've already answered, or answered by someone else answering the questions, but without the "hard" answers to a student's specific needs.<n><n>It's also not clear what the word you are looking for really is. For example, in the first, second, and third questions, you do use the word "teacher", but for answers about students. In the third, your answer is "student teacher", and is followed by the word *in the fourth question. That should be "student". If in the following you are going to use the word "student"... it won't really be a student question since it really should be answered in the fourth question.<n><n>Also, I would consider the other answers in the second question to be just as "hard" as "student" questions. I don't know if I'm interpreting that right (I probably am), so I'm not sure where I can put that - but I am interested in the answer to that question specifically.<n><n>I think the first question is phrased as "How many students are in your class?" However, since you have one student per grade level, you could replace "student" with "teacher" (ie, "in grade 1").<n><n>That would make it more a question asking if the student could "meet" their learning needs, not the other way around.

The answer was an answer that will bring back the fire of God upon those who call upon him. This is His plan for everyone who calls upon him. We can look forward to being filled with Holy Spirit upon our name with the release of the Holy Spirit. I know that God plans to fill the house of our Father with his son John, and that He will have His son be the most important person in our house and in your house. Joe asked Joe what he could do to prepare for this father's role. The answer was to prepare for the fire that God has planned for his life. This is a life well spent. I have a son.

This will prepare him for any other call that you will have, as he will be ready then.<n><n>Input: Jill went to the store and bought 100 packages of hamburger meat.

Here are some basic rules (in no particular order):<n><n>Your answers are supposed to make sense. And they should make sense to the audience with the multiple choice question as a whole.<n><n>Your answer should also give an explicit logical relationship to the question. This is true in the sense that if you didn't give your answer based on the question, you are committing a logical fallacy and you should revise to show a relationship or state it in a way that tells the reader or listener what it means. For example, if you gave your answer "A and B" instead of "A and B", you may be committing a logical fallacy, because "A and B" can be an either/or statement and either "A" or "A and B" have not two different meanings. For example, if I told you that the price of milk was $2.00, you could have an idea that the answer could be both "A and B"! And you could have also said things like "B and C" and not necessarily "A and B" or just "B"!<n><n>A logical fallacy is a fallacy in logic which says that an argument is logically invalid because it is not necessarily true, since it differs from the actual truth or falsity of the argument. For example, if what you said said that the temperature in the room was 25°C and you said "It's 33.3°C outside", then you are committing a logical fallacious statement (in a sense that you are saying an argument is not necessarily true because you did not give a reason why it is true/false) because "It

(or: the most votes, the most votes.)<n>Output:2.5 times more than one)<n><n>Input:Suppose I want to do something with B.  I can't know what the result will be before I begin.  How do I find out which variable will be less likely to change? That is, let x be the number of votes for A and y be the number of votes given to X. Since I want y to be less valuable than A (since A must have a greater number of votes), let c be the time length between A and B. If time L is sufficient, then (where x = B) c must be sufficiently long. Let Q be the total number of votes for A, and let r be the total number of times Y wins over A.  (I know that each time Y wins I get fewer points, because X votes are less valuable and the number q of times Y wins is much larger.) Then what am I going to do with y? What I will do with it (in fact, you can't determine this for yourself, but you must learn what you will do with it) is determine the value of Y.  Since an x-value is always greater than an odd integer, and Y must be greater than, say, the number 1, you can put Y at a position in the range r/r+1 such that y /= y.  That is, suppose the value of y = 10.  In that case, we will put r at position 3 of the range.  This value of r in position 3 will be different than the value of y = 9, because r/r+1 is different from 0.<n>Output: 2<n><n>Input:Let's say I've decided I want to find out what a person's IQ is by measuring his/her reaction times. Here is the IQ scale:  How fast can you read a book for 20 seconds? This test is simple to take, and is available in almost every library. It is the same test that the US government uses to determine someone's IQ, and I predict that this test is more accurate than the tests most American high schools give their students.<n>Input: 25<n>Output: 15<n><n>Input:Supposing the people who came to New Zealand didn't have

He has a few stops along the way, so how about he estimates the total trip time?<n>Output: 45<n><n>Input: One hour of a person’s free time is an amount of time that the person spends on a fixed amount of activity as opposed to moving around.  For each hour of a person‘s free time you can find the value as:  a(1 + a(0 + a(1 + a()))))/2  a(1 + 2a(0.5 - 0.25)?/2  a(2 + a[0.25 - 0.5 - 0.5]])/2<n>Example:<n>The total free time of a person is 9.5 hours of the year.  Let‘s assume that the person occupies 8 hours of those minutes of free time and another 2 hours of free time per day.  Therefore the total free time of a day is 13 hours.  The total free time of a week is 40 hours.  Therefore the total time of a year is 240 hours and the time of the year is 20 days.  Therefore the total number of hours a year is 9,880 hours, which is the number of hours that a person needs to complete the daily tasks of living.<n>Example:<n>The work time of a person is 10 hours a day.  He wakes up, does some chores, gets breakfast and goes to his work.  Each day he takes a further 5-10 minutes to eat breakfast, go to the bathroom, go to work, and go back home.  Therefore each day, his free time is 4 hours.  Therefore the hours he is free during the day during the year is 28 hours.  Since the total number of hours spent in a day is 9,880, the hours he is free are 60, and there are 7 days per year.  Therefore it takes him 36 hours to complete his daily tasks plus the time he is free during the days. Therefore since the total number of hours of his free time is 5,000 hours, his free time is 40 hours.  Since the days constitute a year, the total number of hours is 60. Therefore 30 months is 18,000 hours.<n>Example:<n>A person needs 20 hours per day to get enough sleep.  The only other activity he can perform during that period is a little bit of browsing of the internet during the time

The standard for a liter is 100 ml.  If you give people an average of 100 liters per day based on 100 kg of water for 100 days, then the average rate for liquid consumption in a day is:  L = 50.8 × 100 × 100 = 3.0 liters per day or 1,380 liters per week.  Now multiply that by 365 days during which you give people an average that falls above the unit's standard, e.g. 100 litres per day, and divide by 3,365 and you get the amount of liquid you might expect an average person to drink in a week.  Divide by 365 and you get the amount you would expect if each person drank 1,120 litres per week.<n><n>Input: A man comes into a supermarket in Hong Kong and buys 14 kilogrammes of potatoes the next day from a store in New Territories.

In contrast he wrote that, “My own theory was this: no matter how the elements were arranged in the universe, they were going to reproduce randomly and eventually, in a sort of organic dance, reproduce their original arrangement, so that every living thing looked like its own individual and nothing like anything else.”  His comments were received with wide disfavor, but one biochemist defended him by insisting that not once had Darwin taken into account that his own experiment did not produce the same random chemical reaction that evolution had created.  Other experiments have revealed that the rate at which biological reactions reproducibly reproduce was never the same in a group of organisms that Darwin himself was part of. Is this discrepancy due to the laws of nature or due to Darwin’s own theories? This paper presents experiments revealing whether the rate of reproduction is the same for both of these two types of experiments. We suggest that the explanation lies in their methodologies as much as the fact that the organisms on both of these experiments are living cells.<n><n>Input: In 1968 John Lennon met with the producer Brian Epstein, the publisher Ian McLean, and his friend Yoko Ono. He told Epstein that his music was a political statement, arguing that "all the wars are fought by what we give, not what we get." Epstein refused to buy his new album. In response, Lennon left his recording contract with Epstein, saying, "you never stick with people who treat you like a criminal." Lennon also stated that all music had a message, but it shouldn’t be ignored. Lennon felt betrayed and resigned himself to recording under a pseudonym until 1969, when he signed with McCartney’s record company.  The other two people on the label were a friend of Epstein’s and former Beatles bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr. The record was titled Let It Be. On its release, the album was a massive success, and Lennon was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance for "Here Comes the Sun."<n><n>Output: What is the proportion of the average family income between married couples in California and Utah, and what is it for Utah and the rest of the United States?<n>Output: 11% and 44%<n><n>Input: What percent of the population does not wear a glove when handling eggs?<n>Output: 8<n><n>Input

The child will open it and have 10 seconds to pick out a piece.  The first child to open a candy bar and make a choice gets the candy bar.  The first child that chooses not to eat the candy can hold out his hand.  The child who gives the candy bar all his choices is the candy bar winner.  If the first child takes the candy bar, the child who took the candy bar cannot eat the candy bar in future sessions.  As a bonus, the first child to get 10 candy bars or less loses something from the candy prize:  a piece of candy.  The trick is to have the child choose a piece of candy from among the pieces of candy in the candy bar before he opens it.  The candy bar winner's candy bar is a piece of candy that the candy bar loser has no rights to eat in the future sessions.  Since the candy winner could not get a piece of candy for him in the first session and lost something from the prize when he took the candy bar, the candy bar winer loses nothing.<n><n>Output: 40<n><n>Input: A family of 4 comes to stay for two weeks.

A good place to start is to ask questions in the other sections of the book and then go from there.  By the time you are done with the book, you should be well on your way to creating your own personal business plan.  If you ever have the opportunity to create your own business plan, ask these questions:<n>How will you make money?<n>Who is your customer?<n>Who is your market?<n>Who will help you make money?<n>What is your competitive advantage?<n>How will you create value for your customers/customers' customers?<n>Why should you do this?<n>How will you solve the problems that face your market?<n>What will you do differently?<n>How will you change what works?<n>In the next few weeks, keep track of all the things you are writing down.  The more you create an idea with a customer in mind, the more likely is it you will find an answer.  Eventually, you will put together a solid business plan on your own.<n>After you do what you just wrote, put that blueprint on paper.  You will come up with business cards, postcards, emails, e-mail newsletter templates, blog posts, and business plans.  This is not easy. Writing an idea with a customer will make it seem simple because the idea is simple. However, when you have a strong idea with customers in mind, it puts things into perspective that you just couldn't imagine.  I like to say that when I write the book on business, it's like writing what I think a child should understand, not what their teacher should teach.<n>As I said before, the business plan will not automatically become reality.  You will still have to go out and do a lot more research than to create something that people will want to buy from you.  After you have a business plan

Tim went to bed early on the second night in a row and Daniel worked until late. When Tim went to bed a few hours later, Daniel was still working. What was Tim’s and Daniel’s workload for their first night? Output: 4<n><n>Input / Output:<n>Input A) John went to the gym 1/2 the week before and worked out 2 hours per day.  Additionally, he worked out during the day as well as at night. On one particular day, John worked out hard for 8 hours, then went to bed at 10 pm. In the evening, Daniel went to bed at 3 am. He woke up at 10 pm with a great buzz that lasted the entire night. In the morning, the rest of John’s workout was done, Daniel’s was not, and he started to work out hard right away. On the two days that John actually worked out that week, he worked out for 7 hours, slept for another 6 hours, and worked out for 2 hours in the evening. On the two days Daniel actually worked out that week—a rare and unexpected event—he worked out for 5 hours and slept 7 hours and worked out for 2.5 hours in the evening. If John’s workload the week he worked out was the average for the other two weeks, then his workload the year before was the average for the entire year. If Daniel’s workload the year before was average for the other two years, then his workload the next year would be the average. Since there have only been two such years in the history of the NFL, Daniel’s workload would be expected to be on average for the years that he worked out. If it was expected, then Daniel’s workload in the year that he will work out would also be on average for the two years that he will work out. So, Daniel would be working out on average for five years; the average would be five years; and the year that he will not work out would be on average. Therefore, by Daniel’s calculation of the average for his two year-old year, his workload the week after he will work

This is because people tend to group together to help one another out. An example would be a human flock. There are plenty of other animals living in the rainforest, so a human flock may be more common than one would expect. At the same time, some creatures seek shelter out from other groups, so birds usually gather. At night, the rainforest is not that brightly lit, which makes most people more likely to stay in a group (a flock) than in the dark (one person alone). Thus, when a large group meets, that group sometimes looks like it is crowded.<n><n>Input:A<n><n>Input:A horse can be taught to walk by using signals, which are different for each individual. Different signals are used when the horse's walker is standing next to the horse's "rider," while at other times a signal is used when a rider signals a dog to take a step. The difference in cues that a rider uses is used by the horse when it recognizes a horse, which is a sign that a horse is training for the rider and not just acting for itself. In contrast, signals that dogs use are not used by the horse for the sake of riding the horse. If a horse hears a signal to move, it will make that motion.<n>What is the probability that the animal's handler will move when the horse hears his signal to move?<n>Output: A<n>Input: B<n>Input: C<n>Output: D<n><n>Output:C<n><n>Input 1<n><n>Input 2<n><n>Input 3<n><n>Input 4<n><n>Input 5<n><n>Input 6<n><n>Input 7<n><n>Input 8<n><n>Output: A<n>Output: D<n>Output: B<n>Output: C<n>Output: C<n><n>Input 1<n>Input 2<n><n>Output 3<n><n>Input 4: The number of people is large, and its members often have different jobs.

One customer asked her to show him to his truck  and she showed him to the back of the shed so he couldn’t see her from where he parked his truck. Jane stopped at the back of the shed to turn off the engine, but was surprised to see that she was about 8 feet away from the trailer that was towing the trailer. Jane was 6 feet behind the trailer going 70 mph when she turned the engine off. As Jane was about the turn back to get ahead of the trailer, a truck drove by, and Jane collided into the back of the big rig with the cab. Jane said she would’ve hit the back of the trailer if not for the fact that she would have run off the edge of the trailer and gone over the guardrail onto the highway. While she was lying on the ground, she noticed that the truck in front of her had a flat tire. Jane said she could not get out of the trailer because the brake pedal did not work. Jane started to stand up and the trailer came down on her and pinned her from the rear. Jane’s right foot got stuck on the trailer brake which trapped her in between the tire and the floor. After a few minutes of attempting to use her arm to get herself out, Jane said that her left foot was stuck between the tires; however the rear tire did not come loose. Jane was then able to get out of her trailer. Jane said she does not know how she was able to survive the crash, stating that she only remembers going “bum, bummer, bummer, bummm.” She went to the emergency room and got about an hour and a half of sleep. Jane said she felt fine until she got home later that day. The doctor told her she was going to be out of work for another few months and that she should consider getting back into exercise. Jane started out walking 5 miles a day on the elliptical and elliptical trainer at the gym, but her

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n>Output:		<n><n>Example (3)<n><n>Solution:The total cost to fill the truck is $5,000. The truck, truck driver, and extra block costs $2,500. The labor to fill the truck is not included. The total cost to buy the stones is $5,000 and the stones must then be sold.

Their employers are both at home and therefore cannot observe the men at work. However, because one of the men is a bus driver, both employers witness the men at work and will know which of them is the bus driver. The men do not wish to tell their employers the other's location so they decide to keep their own workstation. Since one of them drives the bus, his station is not near his employer. When the men get to work, they find that no one else uses the station near their employer. Therefore, they decide to hide their station. They do so for three hours and when they see no one using the station they decide to leave. When they do so, they see that all the other men who have previously hidden their stations have also left. They then start to worry that their employer may start looking for them. Therefore, they decide that the man who is driving the bus should go to his own station. He decides to put his station at his employer's place and drive it for three hours. However, when he gets out of the station there is nowhere to park so he decides to spend all the money he has saved for gasoline and buy a bus. When he gets there, he finds that at his new station he has exactly the same workstation that he had at the other station.<n>Since neither man wanted to tell their employers which of them was the bus driver, they only pretended to be leaving.

Therefore, he assumes that they have been there three hours and assumes that they have not used the station near their employer in that time. Therefore, he immediately begins to search for them and finds that they have been using his station and have been there for three hours. Therefore, he then has suspicions and starts to search for them. They then convince him that they have been there no less than three hours, because they used his station and have been at that station for three hours. They then convince him to let them keep their station. However

They both score 100 points and go on to compete in a three round contest. After a long day of competition the teachers evaluate who took up the best positions in each round (in terms of the score they scored against the competition and overall grade they scored). As a result, the teacher determines the winner of this contest by determining who scored the best against the three best scores for his or her grade class (and that is that)  In determining the winner in each round, the teacher has to take into account both points scored and points in each category of the contest.  So, for example, if John scored a 1/10 percentile higher than John Smith, John Smith would not have achieved the same place as John. (There may be a tie at the end if there is a tie between the two.)<n>Output: John Smith wins the contest, but if John's grade was the same then would have taken the same place as John if John's was better.

However it can be assumed that you have a few people in your group that do other things for you. In this lesson we will work to answer some questions we are likely to ask. We will begin by having you calculate the hours you spend at your desk and at home every week.<n>Number of hours spent at home<n>The most important answer when estimating the number of hours spent at home every week is how much money is spent per week. The answer is a lot. Each person in your household is spending a lot of money every week, however you may expect that someone may choose to do other things as well. You may find yourself having some friends that you meet at work doing jobs along side you, or sometimes they may help or even become your roommates. This will give you a good idea of where most of your money is going.<n>Number of other people spending money<n>It does not matter how much money you have or how many people you are living with. The main thing to think about when figuring out how many hours you spend are other people spending money. If you think about it most people have someone spending money for them or for them and others that will help them. These are your family and friends. The important thing when doing cost per hour calculations is that each person is spending money on a different task. We can think of the time spent at work or the money the person spends at home, or maybe they like to go out to eat in the evening. The important thing is to get an idea of how much money you each spend by looking at the tasks you each are doing. You can calculate the hours you waste from the time you spend doing certain tasks for one someone else.<n>Number of hours you spend at home<n>Number three is really what you are trying to figure for number two. How much money you each spend at home. Most people spend money in some form of recreation in the form of TV, movie tickets, etc. These are all non-essentials and when considering your cost per hour calculations you can also think about the time the people spend with you. This is not as clear as it could be but, as we see here, most people make up for their money spent at home or at work with social time outside of the house. Some of the most time spent with people is when they are out doing chores and cleaning. You will

The body of a healthy person weighs 300 pounds, and the body mass index for someone of average weight is between 20 and 25.  If you exercise regularly at that rate, you burn 500 calories.

It is possible for adjectives 2, 3, and 4 to be used in all the sentences in the sentence.<n><n>For the seventh sentence, I would also make the word the object in each of the sentences since the word is used as noun.

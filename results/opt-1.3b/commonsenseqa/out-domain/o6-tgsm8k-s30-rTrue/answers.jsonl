What is the rate per gallon of gasoline?\nOutput:  For one gallon of gasoline, 60% is sunlight B: 25% is darkness C: 10% is water D: 4% is earth's shadow\nSince the average rate is per gallon, the answer is 60%*30%=<<60%*30%=200>>200.\nFor one gallon of gasoline, 40% is sunlight, 60% is darkness, and 25% is darkness.  A rate of 1 litre (100/1,000) of gasoline would be 200/1,000/0=0\nSince the answer is 0, they receive 20% off of their bill for paying in total darkness, only 0.25 litre of gasoline was wasted.\n\nInput: a group of 7 members take 3 days to solve an economic problem, then return home the same day.

{"text": "A is completely correct; B and C are wrong.  E is incorrect because the parents were unable to choose C\n\nInput: The family has three children, and one of the children has diabetes.  Two of the children and their parents have a house.  The children go outside the house to play every day. If they all wore shoes, how quickly would they get wet?\nOutput: All three children are wearing shoes.  If they each wear shoes for 2 minutes, they each step on a pebble from the sidewalk that is about 2\" square.  They step on that pebble twice. After that, they both step on another pebble, with just as much force applied.  That second step is the equivalent of walking on another sidewalk pebble.\nSo their feet stay dry for 2 minutes and 18 seconds when they step on the pebbles two times, instead of for 2 minutes and 22 seconds when they step on pebbles one time.  That adds up to a total of 2 minutes and 16 seconds of dry feet.\nSo since they go out every day to play, and keep their feet dry for 2 minutes and 16 seconds, each has an extra 10% for every extra 5 minutes outside of the house.  That adds up at a total of 110%.  Thus, all three children total 110% when they go outside to play.\nSo since they have dry feet for 10% more time than they had wet feet, they each have an extra 10% extra money after expenses.\nThat makes their total after expenses 110%\n\nInput: A woman who has one eye was driving past the field where a baseball team was practicing.

Sally tells the baby's mom that she is leaving because Billy needs to be with his sisters and brothers forever.  Sally is really sad, but tells the baby's mom she will help with the babysitting/housework/and the cooking, making sure that Billy doesn't eat her husband's food.  She also says she will always love Billy, that she will be his best friend, and that nothing can separate them.  Sally's mom is happy about this, and is relieved in that she is leaving with her family for good so that she won't have to come home and babysit Billy. Sally says that the best way to say goodbye is with her family. Sally's mother says that she will be there to help with the baby's and the cooking.

Thus, the hike takes 1 2/2 miles to complete. Thus, the total travel time on day one is 1 2/2 miles. Thus the total time to hike is 1 2/2 hours = 1 2/2 hours. Thus, the total time to hike on day two is 1 2/2 hrs; therefore, the total time to hiking is 1 2/2 huts = 1 2/2 h.

How long could it take to complete the purchase for $15,000,000?\nOutput: The farm would take approximately 12 years to purchase.  For a 5% down payment, the couple would require $10,000,000.  The farm\u2019s appraiser says that the property would sell for $20,000,000. It could take 12-15 years from the date of the listing to purchase.  It would take 5 years to turn it around into producing the income.  After spending $10,000,0000 in equipment and improvements, the farm would produce $100,000,000.\nTherefore, after spending 10 years for $10,000, 000, the farm would produce 6,000,000 which equals $600,000.00, which is equal to the entire farm\u2019s worth plus interest.\nSince there are 50% down payments, the farm would still be worth $2,500,000 on the closing date. Therefore, the farm would produce 600,000 after 12 years of work.

At age 51, she is pregnant with twins.  She wants $8500.00 at the first visit, then $3000.00 every other week. If she only has $2000.00 to spend, she would prefer not to pay her $3000.00 bill each visit.  What other payment structure does Bob need to employ?\nOutput: Mary is not on Medicare so she does not qualify for Medicare's payment schedule.  Her family has no income beyond what she gets from the Social Security Disability and a few other Social Security benefits.  She does not pay any state, local, or federal income tax, so she does not pay sales or excise taxes.  She receives a partial subsidy on groceries so that when she pays her bills that will reduce the food she cooks for her household.  So, she pays a fraction of her food bills by buying food staples in bulk.  She also provides her own clothes, shoes, and other personal items.  Since there is no need for medical insurance, she does not have a plan for medical expenses.  Instead, she uses her income to pay for the essentials until she can secure enough funds for a private insurance plan.\nBob's total annual income is $50,000.00.  The mortgage is approximately $15,000.00.\nMary's total annual income is approximately $12,000.00 and she receives approximately $5,000.00 in food stamps.\nSo the final average is $35,600.00 / 12000+5,000+10,000+24,000=55,600.00/12000\nThus, the median household income is $35,600/50000/(12000+8,000+25,000+39,000) = 50000/60,000\nThe average total income is $60,000, thus, the median annual income is $15,000.\nThus, the median annual income of the family is $15000/450000/(15000+16,500+31,000) = 9,500/60,000\nThus, if he keeps all his $15000 that he earns, he would have $45,000 for retirement / $35,600 for medical expenses / $35,600/36,800/", "answer": "A: neighbor's house"}

The cost per year to maintain the swimming pool is $2000.  You\u2019d like to improve the pool by purchasing a bigger pump, installing two jetted spas, a waterfall, a spa, and a new heated pool float to help keep the water cool.  You are in a financial pinch, so you decide to borrow $5000 from a friend.  How much would it take to pay off the loan and keep swimming at the same level?\nOutput: It would take 70000/70000 =<<70000/70000=300>>300 to pay off the loan.\nA typical amount of money, say $300 per year, would be charged for swimming.\nThe annual cost to maintain the pool is less than a $300 payment.\nTherefore, it would take 300 /300 =<<300/300=150>>150 (in the real world)\nFor an estimate, multiply the yearly loan fee by 30%.\nA loan with a 3% interest rate means you would have paid 1,750$ to the loan servicer.  It would only have been possible to pay for one season of swimming.\nWith the present interest rate, 1,750*300/3% = $100.00\nTherefore, it would require 150*1,750=$150 to continue to swim.\nThe swimming season would be over by", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}

How many people will be receiving a share of this money?\nOutput:5*50*50=<<5+5+5+5=375>>375\nAs far as a division of income, the total income of the group is 375$ = 377$\nThus, the net individual income of the group is 377$ or 375 + 377 = 431$\nAnd the amount of money that each individual has in the group is 383$ = 386$\nThus, the amount of money paid to all members of the group is 386$ = 384$.\nThus, the amount paid to any individual is 384$, and the amount paid to any of the family members is 386$ or 387$\nThus, the exact amount of money contributed will be 387$, and the exact amount of money given will be 386$ or 387$.\nThus, the final answer is 387\n\nInput:If each car has 9 people in it, how many people will occupy the 3 seats?\nOutput: The number of people in the car is 3 and when the seats are occupied, there is 9 people in the car. Therefore when the car starts, the seat for #1 has no seat, and the seat for #2 has no second seat. When the car starts, the first seat #1 is empty and the car has seats #2 and #3\nThus, the seats are 1 and 2 when the car starts.\nThus, each seat has a value of 3\nThus, the seats will not have to be shared very often because there are 9 people in the car\nThus, the seats that are currently assigned have a value of 9 and will not be shared very often\nThus, the car has less than 9 people\nThus, this is not a very good argument for getting a car with only 5 seats\nThus, 8 is the right answer\n\nInput: A new home is built and the cost per square foot is $200.", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

The typical person eats 8,000 calories. Which of the following figures do you believe are correct that 10,000 calories is a diet amount more than 8,000 calories? (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)\nOutput: 10,000 calories is the average diet amount. The typical person eats 7,500 calories a day.\nThus, the caloric amount eaten by the average person is 7500*8,000 = 10,000\nNow, you can calculate and prove this figure by using the previous question.  The calculation is:\n>=<<10,000+<<8,000>>8,000*<10,000=<<10,000-<7,500>>7,500*<8,000=<<10k>>8,000*8,000-7k=<<10k-<200>>200\nSo the final answer was 5000\n\nInput:Suppose the U.S. had a population of 300 million but a famine occurs and a famine victim's death rate is 30 percent. With a 3-month supply of food per year, how many meals would survive the famine?\nOutput: One meal.\nYou will notice that the formula is different in the above formula than in the following formula.  In the first formula, you divide the number of meals into the number of meals in a day, i.e. (1+2)+4=5 meals.  In the second formula, you divide the total meal number by the number of meals in an entire day.  Thus, the formula for the second formula is:\n1.0+3.0=3.0\nThis means that the final answer is 6 meals.\nYou can solve this problem by yourself.  You use:\n1+3.0*1000=7 meals\nWhich means that you multiply 2,000 times 7.  Thus, you get:\n7.000*1000=200 meals\nTotal is: 200*700=12,000 meals\nTotal amount to eat is 12,000*7000=18,000 meals\nThus, you get 18,000 meals\nThus you get that 18,000/200 is\n2.0/200 =\n=", "answer": "A: battle field"}

{"text": "The person is likely to be awake because of the alert. The answer is A\n\nInput: Joe is a bariatric nurse.  She uses an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor to monitor her blood glucose. When she goes from full wakefulness to sleep, she wakes up only to pee. A machine monitors her blood glucose at this exact moment. If she has a blood glucose level of 80, her pump tells her that she needs to have a bolus to bring her blood glucose level back down to an acceptable level of 50. She decides whether to have a bolus, and if she does, she presses a button to start she pump on its own. Once her blood glucose level drops below 50, she begins to fall asleep and her pump slowly increases its flow of insulin until it is above the pre-determined trigger point. If she had a pump that only worked when the pump's timer went off, she would use her pump while still awake in order to get more insulin out of it before falling asleep. Therefore, her device monitors her blood glucose even while she is sleeping (e.g., while she is in a deep sleep). If she is able to set the trigger points she wants for when she does not wake up, the pump also monitors her blood glucose level. It alarms her so that she does not continue to fall asleep and miss a bolus. If she takes a bolus when she wakes up, the pump delivers insulin to her at the proper rate as soon as the bolus event takes place. She decides not to use her pump during the time that her blood glucose is at or above her trigger level for the day. Thus, she has a pump that tells her when to pump herself and how much to pump in order to maintain her glucose level as close to her target level as possible. If she starts a bolus on her own and then fails to take a bolus when she needs it, her pump will tell her to take a bolus before even waking up but before she actually wakes up. Her pump will also notify her periodically so that when her glucose level starts to rise, she does not fall asleep before reaching her desired target value. If she does not take a bolus, her pump will not help her to hit her target glucose level for the day. If she misses a bolus, her basal rate will go down and her pump will continue to pump. This is because by the time that she is able to start taking a bolus, her insulin pump has already pumped her blood", "answer": "E: conscious"}

Two hundred people live in a room of 20 people.  The maximum amount of people allowed in a room is 40.  The total cost of the room for 150 people is $1500.  How much does it cost to accommodate 150 people?\nOutput: The $1500 per day (1/50)*200 = $1000*200 = $1500\nThe 150 rooms can accommodate 20 people in each (50 x 20 = 150).\nThus the final answer is $1500/20 = $1500/1000 = $1800/1000\nSo the final answer $1500/10 = $1500/8 = $1500/6 = $1500/4 = $1500/2 = $1500/1 = $1500\nSo the final answer of 1500/8 = 1510/50 = $500/6 = $500/4 = $500/1 = $500\n\nInput: A husband and wife live in an apartment building in New York City.

The person playing against the other players receives no rewards.\nIf the game is called Risk and the total reward for winning is $75, then someone who plays for fun will win $75 total, and will only need to play one game, and will win $75.  The person who is playing for entertainment will need the other people to play, which results in 10 playing, and only 9 playing.  The person who wins for entertainment will also need to play one game.  If the game is called Jeopardy and the total reward for wining it is $300, the person who plays for entertainment will also need 9 people to play, which requires 10.  The person playing is still receiving the $300 worth of dollars, however.  The person playing will only receive $150 worth of prizes because the 10th person isn\u2019t there.  The game is called the other names.  All of these rewards are the same.  If they wanted to add more money to the games, they should be called Jeopardy, Risk, etc.\nSo with $75 reward for play, and the other money for wining, the person who plays would still be receiving total $75/75 = $120.  The person who played against other people would receive total $150/150 = $100.  The person who cheated would receive $120 total, and so on.  The people who win for entertaining would earn a different amount.\nThe second person to play, who plays against other people, would earn $120 total, and the person playing the game against other people may also receive more than one ticket.\nTo solve the equation, the total cost of a game with 9 tickets and 9 people was: $1,700.  If the person who wants to play the game doesn\u2019t play because the person playing against other people wants to play the game more, he now has to pay $6 more than if he had played just one game.\nThe other person played was paid $600 of the total prize value, therefore they will lose $600, but that is still more than the person who played against other players.

Her family is poor, so, she is unable to provide the children with a safe and comfortable environment. She is therefore forced to live with her grandparents. Her two older children have a father, who is an alcoholic and drug addict. Her 10 year-old daughter is the only child and does the cooking at the family dinners.  What is the greatest danger to the 9 year old girl at the time and what will Mary do to protect her from this danger?\nOutput: The greatest threat to the 9 year old that Mary will be confronted with throughout her life is her father.  She needs to know that her father is on his way to jail for drunken driving, and that her mother is doing her best to keep her safe.  While Mary\u2019s grandmother does do her best to protect her daughter Mary, she does have some weaknesses too.  For instance, her grandmother is not sure if her daughter understands exactly why it is important to wash the dishes after she ate.  In other words, the grandmother is not too sure how to keep her daughter safe. So while her grandmother and the girls are doing their best to keep Mary safe, Mary needs to understand both her situation and that of her grandmother. So when her father does come to visit she needs to understand that he has plans to clean out his grandmother\u2019s car and then take the 9 year old to McDonald\u2019s before driving her to her grandmother\u2019s house where she will continue her mother\u2019s education. So Mary needs to know that her grandmother is being honest and that there are good things happening behind the scenes.\nHowever, if Mary is not strong enough mentally to deal with the situation her father and grandmother are facing, then she is not strong enough to handle the situation of raising a 9 year old. She is too young and does not quite know what is going on with this. So unless she can keep the pressure on her mother, she would be better off going with her father and grandmother. So she must become more strong mentally but, at the same time, she must grow mentally as well. So it appears that Mary might be going to a place that she is better off not going to. But her grandmother does not know what is going on and so she does not really know what the family is doing. The situation could be worse, she could be", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}

This works out well so that you can create many different titles. It\u2019s very important to use the numeral \u201c0\u201d for titles you create about yourself for your business. Also the numeral \u201c1\u201d needs to be used for titles you create about other people because people have to remember to type \u201c1\u201d at the end of the titles.\nSo if your business is selling products for your body, \u201cbody products\u201d sounds a little strange. But by adding \u201cproducts\u201d to it, \u201cbody products 1\u201d is created, and then \u201cbody products 2\u201d gets created by using the product number, which is \u201c2.\u201d\n\nInput:The temperature at which a gas becomes liquid is 20\u00b0C, and in the absence of a gas at that temperature,  which temperature would you expect to find the liquid gas at?\nOutput:40\u00b0C, so at 20\u00b0C, if there is no gas to absorb, the gas will become liquid\n(40-20=<<40-20=30>>30)\nThus, 40\n\nInput:The population of Greece is 1.4 million.

In one litre of milk the same amount of milk was needed to feed the pig as was needed to fill the pig\u2019s stomachs.\nPig weighing seven hundred twenty pounds would need ten liters of milk.\nThus, the total number of liters of milk in a pig\u2019s body would be twenty four liters.\nSo the final number of liters of food required for one hundred pig would equal to eighteen thousand forty five grams.\nThus the total number of litres of food required for the pig to survive would come to 18,500 pounds.\nNow the number that is being multiplied by twenty four is the quantity needed to give the pig one hundred pounds of food.  That number is 18,500 pounds, and divided by fifty seven, we get eighteen five hundred pounds, or eighty five thousand six hundred and fifty seven grams.\nSo the final total of food required by the pig for one hundred pounds of food is eighty five thousand five hundred and five grams.\nThus, the final total of food that was provided to the pig is eighty five thousand five thousand five hundred and four grams.\nHow in one question could a wrong answer be wrong and correct answers be correct, respectively?

Each house has an individual air conditioner unit.  John\u2019s house has the one unit, and he has been charging $80/unit for the last 9 seasons.  The rent to tenants has increased by $50/unit.  At $80/unit, John\u2019s total bill is $15,000/season.  If he decreases his bill by a quarter to $60/unit, how much will he make from this increase in rent?

What is the total cost of eating out for the month?\nOutput: Daily expenses are $90 each\nSpending $90 on eating out for dinner each month gives them an income of $1450 during the month, divided among the three $900 grocery store bills, gives an income of $7000 each month.\nSo the total cost of eating a meal each week is $7100.

It is the side (perpendicular to the equator) of the face of the moon.  The origin of the two hemispherics can be traced to a collision between the moon and the Earth that created two mountains.  The mountains now lie to their northern and western sides.  This created the two hemisphers.  Since the only two continents on the planet are in North America, South America and the Western Hemisphere, the two hemispheres are also referred to as the continental Americas.  There are three reasons for the name.  First, it is easier than calling the different latitudes by a name because they are all the same geographical latitude.  Second, when the North and South Americas merged, they created the greatest change in latitude during the course of human evolution.  Third, from an ecological standpoint, the hemisphere with more water was selected to become the northern hemisphere.\n\nInput:For the purpose of this worksheet, the students are trying to understand if the weather in the northeast or the south will be colder this winter.

She has 2 children and is going to leave them in another state in July and has to borrow $100,000 to go there.  The loan is for a year and for $100,000, her parents will lend her 80% of the amount.  Her family will lend the other 20%.  Since the loan is one year, Jane will need 12% in cash before closing the deal.  She needs 5000$.\nInput: Jane needs 5,000 dollars.\nOutput: Jane has 5,000 dollars.  There are 40 people in her family, so 20% of the $500 will be taken from each one.  15% is from her brother and 15% is from her nephews.  The remaining is from her parents.  So out of the five total, 12% will come from each family member.  The rest will come from her parents.  The remaining $2500 is taken from herself, which will leave her with $3500 in savings.\nSo the final total is 3500-3500-6500=<<3500-3500=1750>>1750$.\n\nInput: We have a farm and the family needs to rent a barn for the summer.  Our rent is $600 a month plus tax and utilities.

Thus we will need to do $200-100-100/10 = $300 in debt each year.\nSo over the 5 years, the total will equal $800 divided 10 times equal to $300 in debt.\nSo the total is $800\n\nInput: The child of a", "answer": "D: were very tired"}

How many children can fit in the vehicle?\nOutput: The two bus drivers each take 7 and all children fit.\n\nExpert Answer:\nLet's assume that the distance from one car to another cannot be measured in meters and that the length of a car cannot be measured in meters.\nThe time can be measured by dividing by a constant.\nThe speed is measured by multiplying a constant by a constant.\n\nSuppose the speed of the bus is given as 10 m/h.\n\nSuppose there are 50% more cars than buses on the road.\n\nIn this case the distance between buses is given by\n/50=0.5\n/50-6.5=0.7\n/50-6/7=0.4\n\nThus, the distance can be measured as\n/60=8\n/60-6/7=8\nThus, the distance between the two buses is\n/60-8=5\n/60-6=2\nThus, the distance for the six children is\n/(60+6/7)+2=5\nThus, the distance per car can be measured as\n/(60/70)=0.05\nThus, the time of one car to the other can be measured as\n=(180/5)+(180/7)=0.5\nThus, the total time to be spent is 5\nThus, the average speed of the two buses can be given by\n/(180/5)+=0.4\nThus, the bus has a speed of 5m/h, thus it can take 50% longer, 50% less and 50% slower than the bus with 70 passengers and 15 cars respectively.\nThus, the total number of passengers is the same, but the time per car has increased by 50%.\nThus, the total distance per car is the same, but it takes 10 minutes longer.\nThus, the average rate of speed is 10% slower, thus 10 times less.\nThus, the rate of speed is 20% slower, thus 20 times less.\nThus the distance travelled is 100% less, thus 100 times less.\nThus 0=0\n\nInput: The distance between cars can be measured by making an equal distance as tall as one another.

The farmer will plant 15 trees a year beginning in 1995.  What is the total amount of money the farmer must receive to meet the government\u2019s cost of $2000 to plant the trees?\nOutput: $12000\nThe government owns the land and is allowed to charge for the space.\nSo $2500 a year is needed to hire an gardener, which is equal to the subsidy.\nSo 50$/year will be needed on top of the subsidy.\nTherefore, when the cost of planting is discounted from the cost of leasing the space, the net subsidy for the farmer will equal $2400/year.\nAnd $2000 per year for 15 trees annually will equal $2400 divided by 15=<<2400/15=$1280>>1200\nThe net subsidy is $1280 and the subsidy is divided by 15=<<1280/15=$1230>>1200\nThus it equals 1275\n\nInput:Which of the following describes a farmer?

He begins serving coffee on Tuesday every week.  The cost of the coffee is $5 extra each day.  How will the restaurant be able to meet its operating costs?\nOutput: The additional $5 each day is equal to the cost of renting the coffee equipment.  The additional cost for renting the equipment equals the number of days that the coffee is on the menu.\nBecause the rent is on a per day basis, only the initial equipment cost is needed.\nThis does not assume that the coffee is only served on Tuesday since if not, the additional days could cost more.\nSo the initial cost equals the number of days, multiplied by a percentage cost, and the per date cost equals the cost per day divided by the per day percentage.\nThus, the cost to start each day equals $5.00/day and the daily cost equals $5.00/(100*15) = $10.00 per day\nTherefore, the additional cost equals $100 and the cost is divided by 15=>>10/15=15/15 equals $15/15$", "answer": "B: basement"}

If the two take turns in this arrangement, they can go on a boat ride for an hour or two and then take turns at the dining room for an hour or so or so before returning to their quarters.  That leaves everyone still on the boat time to watch a movie or play a game online that they might be interested in.  Since the two people don\u2019t take over right away, they have plenty of time to play a favorite game before returning to their quarters to continue eating while the other three fish are still asleep in their quarters.  This arrangement has enough time for everyone to be done eating and returned to their quarters so that one person is left to finish the meal while everyone else is still in their quarters.\nTherefore, the final answer is 20\n\nInput: The school will be collecting money for a fund to support students who will not be participating in the spring sports season.

How much would each dealer pay to lease the car?\nOutput:Car dealerships each pay $1500 up front.\nTo lease a car for one year requires 25% down payment.\nThe dealer pays the remaining balance on the end of the lease when the bill comes in.\nThus, for a brand new car, the dealer would pay 1000$ and lease the car for 25 months.\nSo the final total, if the dealer leases 30 cars, is $4000.\n\nInput:You, along with your friend, sell your jewelry.

The payment is $1050 for Bob\u2019s $500 car rental\nBut the car does not need gas in order to be used by Bob.  So the car payment is not $1050 for Bob, it would be $10 for Bob\u2019s 100 miles of driving in a car with 4 tires.  So the payment is $10 for Bob and $1000 for the car rental\nBut the 100 mile gas-powered trip in a car with 4 people would not require a payment for 50 miles of driving in a gas-powered car\nThus, Bob now has 1000-500=$500+1000=$1000\nSo the final answer must be 1000", "answer": "B: grocery cart"}

{"text": "Chatting is social bonding\nSo the final answer  is chatting\n\nInput:Suppose that Bob received two letters. Suppose that Bob received one letter and a statement telling Bob that the other note is a duplicate. Suppose that the first letter stated that if Bob accepts the duplicate letter, then he should return a duplicate, but return it today. That is, the original and the duplicate must both be mailed today. Assume that this is not the case because if Bob rejects one letter, he will not accept the duplicate, so he would not send it today. Let's assume that Bob wants to keep the duplicate so that he can later return it. Suppose that Bob does not write back but simply puts the duplicate in an envelope and sends it in because he is afraid it will be lost. What is the probability that he will receive a duplicate that contains no note?\nOutput: One thing is for sure.\nIf Bob receives only one letter, then the message is for him to return it. And he would have to send the letter today if he receives it, because a duplicate would contain a note that it was in his mailbox. So, if he is not certain that he will have a duplicate, he should not write back.\nIf Bob receives two letters, as in 1+1=2, then the probability that he will write back is much smaller than the chance that he will receive a message that did not go through in a mail slot. Because any message sent today can be written on the other letter and read to make sure he received it, this is a good way to increase the chances that Bob writes back, but he should not worry about the probability that he will not receive a duplicate.\nIf Bob receives 2+2=3, then the probability of him writing back is very small, about the same as 1+1.\nAnd finally, if he receives 5+5=10, then any extra note may also be lost by the postman and therefore not sent today. If he receives something like that, it does not give him any chance to write back and reject it. So he is not in a good position.\nIf Bob receives 5+3=7 and 8+10=15, then the probability of writing back is small compared to 6+7, but he will have a higher chance of receiving one for each.\nFinally, 3+2=5, and 4+1=7, which give him even less chance to write back than 2+2 and 3+1", "answer": "E: social bonding"}

How many of the doctors she sees are specialists in his/her medical condition?\nOutput: The patient had a total of 4 consultations with four different doctors. She was seen twice by a specialist. She was seen twice under another specialist.\nSo, based on the total number of doctors seen, she had 4 consultation with 4 specialists over 2 months. Given this figure, the total number of doctors she met during her first month of treatment is 4:4:4.\nFor instance, a total of 4 consults + 4 consultations with 4 specialists = 8 consults. Total consultations: 8\nTherefore 4 consultations, 4 consultations with 4 specialists each = 4 consultations with 8 specialists.\nThus, each consultation counts as 1 consult:=4 consultations with 8 specialists divided by 4 consults with 4 specialists divided by 8 consultations\nThus, each consultation does not count as 1 consultation:=4 consultations with 4 specialists divided by 4 consultations.\nThus, 4 consultations do not count as the same number of consultations with 4 specialists over the same amount of time.\nThus, only one consultation with 4 specialists counts.\nThus, 1 consultation counts as half of the number of consultations with 4 professionals.\nThus, 2 consultations with 3 different doctors count as half of 4 consultations with 4 doctors.\nThus, 2 consulting consultations with 3 different doctors do not count as 1 consultation with 4 specialists.\nThus, 1 consult counts as 1/4 of the number of consultations.\nTo figure out how many consultations she had:\n(Total Number of Consultations with 4 Professionals)/4 : (Total Number of Consultations (Total) divided by (Total Number of Consultants))\nThus, every consultation with her doctor counts as one consultation\nThus, half of all the consultations she made with her doctors count as 1 consultation.\nThus, 1/5 of all consultations she made counted as 1 consult\nThus, 4 consultations divided by 2 consultants, 4 consultations divided by 3 consultants, 4 consulting consultations divided by 5 consultants divided by each subsequent consultation she made counts as 2 consultations with 4 physicians.\nThus, 1 consulting consultation with 4 doctors does not count as 1 consult for both 4 doctors and 4 consultants.\nThus, 4 consults by 4 doctors does not count for 1 consultation.\nThus 1 consultation does not count as 4 consults with 4 doctors.\nTherefore, 1 consultation with 4 doctors does NOT count as the same", "answer": "D: wakefulness"}

In a later sale, he sells the grain at cost, in which case he still gets a return.  In total, the farmer\u2019s cash value is $3,600.  As the amount of interest earned on the sale increases, he has more money in cash. His initial total return for the investment does not change \u2013 1%. If this amount had been invested directly in the stock market, the return would be 3%, but the amount of money invested in cash is the $3,600 plus interest. Therefore, the total return on his investment (including interest) would be 3.00% instead of 0.99%.\nTotal return:3.00%*$3,600*3.00%^1.5^2=10.00% and 5.00% in interest\nThus the final answer for D is 10%\n\nInput:The car insurance company charges $2,500 for rental insurance and $950 for coverage in the event one gets injured while driving the vehicle.

Over a 30-day period, the farmer decides to have each cow weigh a different number of pounds. How many pounds weighs each cow at the end of 30 days?\nOutput: Each cow weighs the same number of pounds at the end of the 30 days.  If the cows were to be fed the same amount of food, they would still weigh equally.  Thus, if the cows were fed the same amount of feed, they would weigh differently.  Therefore, to determine which weight to subtract from each cow's weight, each cow must weigh the same amount of feed from day one through day 30.\nOutput: Each cow weigh 10/10 * 1000+1000=<<10/10*1000+1000=1>1.\nIf the cows were to be given 500 pounds of feed, they would still weigh the same amount at the end of 30.  Therefore, to reduce each cow's weight from their normal weight, the farmer determines how many pounds this cow's weight is after being fed 500 calories per day.  Thus, each day, the farmer determines how much food the cow can consume.

For the stats to become more accurate, the violent crime rate must increase or decrease, or there must be a greater number of murders and crime and the ratio of people murdered by their own hands must be greater than the relative ratio of victims.\n(Note: this only works in the US or the US where the murder rate is less than the population)\nSo if we assume that the crime rate increases by 20%, but no more than 5% of the population, there will be a population increase as well as a rise in murder. Therefore, on average, we would like there to be 25 murders.\nHowever, since the population increase is 20% and there is an increase in murder, the number of victims would be 24 instead of the 21 in Year 3.\nTherefore, there is a small increase in the amount per victim but a statistically insignificant increase in the number of victims.\nSo the violent number for the period of the study is 17.\n\nInput: Four groups of twins are assigned to four families, each family with an average income of $3,000,000.

The total dose cost $2.25*60=<<60+2.25+2.25=$65.00\nSo, the total cost per pill was $65.00\nIn all these cases, the total cost of two pills would be $65.00.\n\nInput:The man named Joe works for the railroad company and in one of his routes he passes by a construction site.

The third area: the passenger lounge, each berth occupied from the 4th to the 8th berth.\n3. The 4th to the 9th berth: the dining area on the 4th berth.\nOutput: The first two areas, which make up the engine compartment are the most expensive.\nThus, the first 2 areas make up >1/2 the total cost, while the 3rd are the least expensive.\nThus, if we divide the total cost of the engine compartment by the number of engines in the ocean liner, it will be found that the total cost for the engine compartment is 25000$.\nThus, the first location, which makes up the engine compartment, has a total cost of 25000$, while the second location, which makes up most of the third area, has a total cost less the 250000$.\nThus, 1/2 of the total cost, is made up from the 2nd location, which makes up almost 100%, and the 3rd, which makes up most.\nThus, the entire third area will cost 20-20-8-6=3100$.\nThus, the second location does not contribute any to the cost, as it is only the 2nd location, while the 3rd location did not contribute, since there is not much of the 3rd area in the ocean liner.\nThus", "answer": "A: being understood"}

Given this information, estimate the number of jobs needed for a market economy to have a level of safety for all individuals.\nInput : If there are 2 manufacturers, the 1st job will be 100 (100x2)=125; if there are 2 manufacturers, a 2nd job will be 125 (100x2)=250; if there are 3 manufacturers, a 3rd job will be 250 (100x2)=375; if there are 4 manufacturers, a 4th job will be 375 (100x2)=500\nOn this number, the manufacturing jobs should be 50/125(1x2)=.50, and in the other manufacturing sites (in the rural areas, in the coastal states), the manufacturing jobs should be 95/125(1x5)=50.\nOutput: 125 jobs in the community and 250 in other locations(rural areas)\n\nInput: In July and August, the total number of new automobiles in the US is 75,000 cars per month.

It requires $10,000 to rent a car. How much do you pay for your car rental?\nOutput: Renting your car costs $120 per day.\nSo the total bill is $120, which you must pay $40 for and the other $140 is to rent the car itself.  Therefore, you must pay $120/day.\nThus, you are paying $120/day for a rental car.\nBut you will have $120 in car repairs, $20 in rent, and $140 in car insurance!  Thus, your total cost of $360 will be $360 minus $20 = $270.25. Now, your total car cost will not be $360 but $270.25, since you must pay $240\n\nInput: There is a $10 charge to rent the library book. That is the rent:rent:rent=rate divided by 5.\nOutput: Renting the $10 book adds $0.25 to the rent/day and reduces the total rental cost to ($4.25 x 5) = $4.00/day\nRent-by-rate=5\nRent-rent:rent=5-10=<<>4>>4\nNow you have an $8 car rental. Renting the book added an $8 car rental and a $2 book rental each day.\nThus, each day you would rent your car would cost you $80.\nEach day you used your car was more than $3 worth of car repairs.  Thus, the total car repair cost would be $30.  So it would take you 27 days to rent your car, but in your payment to the rental company\n\nInput: A person lives 100 ft. from the railroad tracks and drives an 18 foot (4 meter) car regularly.

In 10 years, the house sells for $400,000.  If he had deposited 25% of his original $100,000 in today's dollars (2000) he'd have $400,000 in his savings. What is the amount he would have in his account on the 10th anniversary? What happens when his house is sold? What if his first house wasn't sold for $400,000?\nOutput: If he saves a total of $20000 in 2000 he will receive $20000 when he sells his house.  Thus, $20000 in 2000 will become $400.  The total amount from saving $20000 is $400.\nBecause the $100,000 has become $400.  Since the original $100,000 is now equal to $400, $20000 will not have become $400.  Thus, $400 will not have become $20000.\nSince $400 will not have been the original amount, the total will never amount to $20000 since the money has become $400.\nTherefore, $400 has never become $20000.  Hence, $400 has never been $20000.  Therefore, the final answer is $200\n\nInput: An employee at a company is making a yearly salary of $70,000.

One adult (parents) will need to have savings to pay the down payment on the house. Assuming a down payment of $3500 and a 35% payment rate of 8%, both will need to save $750.00 each month.\nEach child will need $50.00 cash (for the down payment) and $100.00 cash in savings. Thus they each must save $150.00*200= $750 in cash each month. Hence each parent is responsible for saving $250.00*8= $1500 in cash each month. There are 250 dollars per month per child\nSo they each must save $1,500 per month in their own funds each month =<<250/250=1200>>1200. They will need to save $15,500 total.\nThey will need to save $75,000 total for the down payment, the children's down payment and for the house.\nThey will need enough money to earn 18% interest on their down payment and the house.\nThus they will need $100,000 in savings each month. So it will take $75,000*15,500 = $150,000 per month for down payment and $15,500*$150,000 = $750,000 each month to save for down payment.\n\nInput: Mary is an architect and lives in New York.

Alice works from 2 pm to 8 pm, and Jane works from 8 pm to 2 pm on Mondays. What hours do Alice and Jane work, if any, after 8 pm on Wednesdays?\nOutput: Alice works from 5 pm to 8 pm Wednesdays. Jane works from 2 pm to 7 pm Fridays and 6 pm to 4 pm Sundays. So 7 days in a week means 30 hours, not 48. This means each day in a week is 48 hours. A day is 8 hours long. Thus, there are 168 = <168=10>>10 hours each week, which means 30 hours total in a week. Each day in a week is 60 hours. So a week is 168 hours in a week. A 2-day weekend is 45 hrs.

Since it is cheaper to buy half-and-half than it is whole milk, which milk should you buy?\nOutput: Whole milk.\nFrom the price difference, the milk cost is $1.50.  The additional 50 cents is for the labor it took to fill the milk cartons in the first place. The additional 50 cents is not a cost of the milk itself, the additional 10 cents (half and half) represents a cost of filling the cartons.\nTherefore, the new cost of milk is $1.50/50$=<<50>50 cents\nThe additional 50 cents is not the cost of the milk, it is the labor of filling the carts.\nThus, the new cost of the milk is $1.25\nThe final", "answer": "E: drawer"}

They have to herd to produce milk. Alice needs 1 cow to do a load of milk. The cow is named Ethel. Alice knows that if Ethel eats grass at every meal, she will not produce the milk she needs.  Ethel eats hay on the side of the barn.  Her milk production decreases, and Ethel eats more hay.  Alice knows that if she leaves her cows eating hay, the cows will be weak.  If Ethel eats grass instead, she will not be weak.  Alice also knows that if she stops her cows from eating hay, the cows with no grass will suffer as well. So, Alice selects one cow to have grass instead of hay and a different cow to eat hay. Alice also decides to place her cows in a separate barn from those that eat grass to prevent Ethel from eating less grass than the others.  Each other cow has one feed trough set on the floor that they cannot get in. Alice realizes that the other cows will suffer if Ethel eats less grass than the others but takes her chance and feeds her cows Ethel instead.  Ethel has a lower milk production than the cows that Ethel eats.\nInput: Alice has 41 cows and Ethel is eating grass when she is fed a meal.\nOutput: 41*41*41*41*21 = 101\n\nInput: The value of milk produced per animal depends on what happens to the cows and how many eggs they lay.

The minimum rent in the apartment is $850, and a family of four needs another $200 for food, heat, laundry, and transportation. The family pays almost $1,000 when the woman\u2019s parents are present. How much do the father\u2019s parents give every year?\nOutput:A father who lived in the apartment with his husband and two children is making $7,500 a year. They live on his income of $6,000 and his mother lives with him and his parents on $700 a month. His parents contribute $400 a month. The annual income, divided by two equals $1,400 is the amount that is needed to meet the rent, food, heat, laundry and transportation charges of $8,600\nSo each of the children is eligible to receive $3200 through various means. They each get $1740.\nSo the monthly expense of the woman\u2019s family for the rent is $1240 divided by 4 = $9.60\nSo the monthly expense for food is $1,440 divided by 1 = $3.40\nSo", "answer": "D: step forward"}

The winds blow the plane 70 miles away from its starting point:  It remains in the sky, 8 hours, and is seen eight days later by people in Dallas and six weeks later by people 40 miles away from Dallas.  The winds blow it 90 miles away from its starting place:  It remains in sky, 18 days, and is seen nine days later in Dallas and two years later in Dallas.\nOutput: The wind blows 70 miles off of the plane.

How much was the total cost of renting the cattle?\nOutput: The yearly rent of the 50 cows would be:\n[Rent/50], *Rates. = [Rent/0.50].\nFor example, for the number 50 cows in the ranch, each cow would be rented for $500 per year.\nRates = [(500/50)^50), *Rent.\nRates / 50 = [(500/0.50)^-50)^50]\nSo the final answer would be $500 rent / 50 = $520\nA cow would be rented for a year at $500 per year = $$10,000, with the total cost of the cattle being $10,000 * $520 = $$13,500\nSo the final answer of $13,500 is the annual cost for the year.\n\nInput:What time does the sunrise in San Francisco begin?\nOutput: The Sunrise would be 7 am PDT      ,      Sunrise would rise    at 6:46 am PDT    because 7:46, PST [Sunrise] falls on an      [Day],      Sunday    as      Friday     ends    on Saturday", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

If you did not pay the ticket after the first day of court at the same time the second week of court (for example April 28th at 11:00 AM) the second time the tickets would not be applied to your account.

How many times a day will your construction crew use, total, the washroom?\nOutput: If they use the washroom every other day, on average, they will use 250 times the bathroom every 2 days.\nSuppose they only use it once a week.  How likely are they to use it each week?\nOutput: Based on the average daily consumption of the bathroom, they will use it only four or 11 out of every 12 days.\nThe average time between washes is 8 hours in an average day.\nSince the average washroom in the state is 500 meters (164,400 feet) long, 500 times 8 hours/day for 8 hours/day gives 5500 meters (164,400ft) of washroom.\nSo, the average times to do their work between washes = 5500 meters (164.400 ft) / 8 hours/day * 8 hrs/day = 20 minutes.\nThus daily washroom usage = 5050 meters (164,400 ft) / 8 hrs/day = 0.005 meters/minute = 0.01 feet.\nUsing this information from the washroom, we need the total distance of the washroom for our construction crew to be 1500 meters (9.4 miles) for the entire 18-20 days in a month.\nOutput: 1 mile = 12,000 meters.\n\nInput: A car will cost $1000+400/day to rent.

If the number of children grows by 10% but the marriages increase by the same number, neither the children nor the parents will benefit in any way from the change. So, for the 10% change in the number of births, it will be decided whether people will benefit from it or not. What is the effect of a 10% change?\nInput: If the number of marriages increases by 10%, then the amount of money the man will receive will be increased by the same amount. If the number of birthsdecreases by 10% then there can be no change because the amount received is unchanged. The difference is not worth reporting.\nOutput: If the amount of marriagesdecreases by 10%, then the number of people living in the household decreases by the same amount. The amount of money a man will receive from his family does not change and the amount received by a woman will not decrease because the money she receives from her family is still the same. If the amount of families receiving money from their families grows and decreases simultaneously, no one can benefit from it. So, a 10% increase in both the number of marriages and the number of families receiving money does not affect anyone.\n\nInput:  A new family group that has recently moved into a new house.

Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid<n>Output:		 (choices follow sentences) We should ignore sanctions because they seem to have achieved the same result as other punishments. We should enforce the changes by yelling at them to change. We would need a system to do the yelling (as in, we would have to use a system that would yell at the students to change their grades and stop cheating). We should impose a heavy price for cheating.<n>There are s=s1-s2+s3-s4+. As a result, there are s=s5-s6+.<n>There are s=<5=5>>s7.<n>So you need a system to enforce the changes that you make. So you need a system to do that. So you need a way to impose the changes on the students. And you need a program.<n>We could simply yell at them to change. There could be a system where teachers would shout at them to change. But would that system enforce the change?<n>If we yell at them, does that really change their behavior?

This equation evaluates to A*50+D+D+D+10.<n>Let's say the deceased's family decided to give Joe's family a $10,000 lump sum payment for the damage to his body.  In doing so, there is a 30% tax on the money.  This is a loss of $60 in a total loss of $270.  Suppose the amount is $10,000.  Joe's family has a total income of $8,000.  If all of this is subtracted from Joe's family's income, then Joe's family is $360 poorer.  Suppose the money was given to Joe's family for use on a wedding.  Suppose that all but $60 of Joe's money was placed on the wedding registry.  This still means that Joe's family will not get the full amount of money.  This equation evaluates so that the sum is C+32.

Your first job is to start lining up all your stuff. Your second job is to be the driver. The third job has to be a secret from the other drivers.  Then you take a ten minute break for lunch. As you hurry along the traffic you look over at the other drivers and you can see that even though they appear to be driving on their breaks they are really really not.  There are fifteen cars between you and the end point. Your fourth job is to drive the limo without hitting any of the people riding in their cars. Your fifth job is to be in the back seat riding with the driver. Your sixth job is to drive the car so fast to keep the people in the cars from falling out of it. Your seventh job has to be a taxi driver. Your last job is the escort lady.  You have to make your limo go forty miles an hour for the first half-hour and sixty miles an hour for the second half-hour.  All your work is worth less than that - unless they happen to find a bomb or something, in which case you get paid $2,500. After the limo is done, you must return to the limo on foot and you have to turn over all the keys.  Then you get to call someone to come pick up your limo and that person gets $100,000.  So your work is worth $100,000 * $35.00 per minute, per mile, per hour. It is the job of the limo driver - that, and to avoid hurting the people in the cars - that leads to the pay. What is your first payment?<n>When you get back to the limo, you have to go to the bathroom. At the last minute the driver has decided you will have to go in

She has three baskets on her workbench: a front, middle, and back basket. She uses these baskets to put away her clothes so that her laundry takes less time to do. Then she goes to stand back at her laundry machine and starts washing clothes. She notices a man sitting beside her washing dishes, and as she walks to the machine, she puts a fork in the dishwasher and sits down so that she can wash his dishes. She takes two spoons that the other person has and replaces them so that her dishes will not be dirty again. After washing her dishes, she puts the forks in, and now she has the remaining dishes washed, which takes only a few minutes longer for her. When she leaves to go to the washer, she takes a dish shaker with her, so that she can bring the dishwasher into the bedroom to wash and put away clean dishes. When she returns to the laundry room and starts the washer, she realizes that she forgot the dish shaker which takes about five minutes longer than it would if she didn't bring it with her to begin with. She doesn't hear another person in the household using the other washer or dryer, so she decides that the dish shaker is important, so she puts it in her purse and takes it with her. While she is busy sorting and cleaning, the man returns from washing the dishes, puts the dish shaker into the washer, and loads the machine. She goes and places the plates in the middle-bottom basket as directed, and now she has ready-to-consume plates which took only two minutes instead of three. She takes a fork from the

For example two numbers cannot be counted backwards, and the same cannot be counted forwards. For instance, to count forwards, you must count one number backwards. For instance, to calculate the number of calories eaten by a food per day, you should first divide the calories of each food by the number of calories in the food. You then calculate the number of calories in to which food you divide each. For example, a food has 1200 calories. You can calculate 1200 divided by 2. Now you calculate the calorie count for each food in the diet. For example 1200 divided by 2 will give you 3. Now you subtract 2 from each food to find the number of calories in. Your calorie count is the number of calories in per day:  A=1200 * 2.5 D=1200 * 2.<n>Input:The numbers 3 times plus and minus 3 times a number plus or minus a number is three times the number of those numbers plus three times the number of the number of those numbers.

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n>Output:		 Nothing will happen to skin<n>In the heat of a situation, a human would expect to feel things that are not supposed to. We would expect things not to feel things that aren't supposed to feel things. That's why there is no skin pinch when a mosquito bites.<n>In any situation, we have a choice. The choices we make can affect the situation and the consequences of those choices can affect us. When we make choices, we make a choice regarding how we will react. In some situations we like things to be certain. When we don't we like things to be uncertain. When we don't like it we don't want to feel it happen. So in trying to avoid a lot of stuff happening, we tend to act on our preferences, we don't want to act on our preferences.<n>In your situation, you would feel something if it happened and you would choose to not feel it, because you prefer your hand not feel something happen. This means that the number of choices that you make determines the number of results. The more choices you make, the more likelihood there is that something will happen.<n>The more options that you have, the more likelihood there will be a lot of stuff that happens. So you tend to tend to do something that you don't like.<n>In your situation if you didn't choose to not feel the skin, then you wouldn't feel anything and you wouldn't want things to happen in your favour. So when you make more options you make a choice about how you will react to that choice and what it will be. When things happen, they are what they are, they're a part of your experience. You don't really care that they're there. If anything, you probably like them more to be present. That's why we like things to be as they are. Our choices, when we make choices are just the things that happen. They are just part of our experience. You don't need to worry much about them.

If an artist decides to sell the entire thing to a music store, they would be able to play it there.<n><n>Question:<n>What can a music box be used for?<n>Response: This is one of the best questions, just the right amount of vague and open as to not get too close to the mark or just far enough to not get caught. There are actually multiple different answers but I've only listed two.<n><n>1) In any given situation they can be used in.<n>2) Only when set by the maker to do so. For example if you are the maker you can give it one action to play music and nothing else. If your friend is the maker, there are two possible actions: 1) play a song 2) play nothing as there is no music box that takes more actions than one.<n><n>Question:What is the difference between "theatre" and "theater"?<n>Response: There are two major differences between the two. Firstly, theatre has an audience and in such a scenario the play must be acted out with a group of people. Secondly, theatre is more theatrical than "theatre" because the actor must be the center of attention or the audience would get bored and not enjoy it. The more attention you pay an actor the more enjoyable it gets.<n><n>Question:Which is a good musical instrument with a body shape and style?

The strings (with holes in between)<n>B.) the bow (with no holes in between)<n>C.) the bow's body size.<n>D.) the bow's tension<n>E.) the bow's shape<n>The correct answer is C because her hands have to move along the strings to maintain tension.<n>The incorrect answer is D. It doesn't make any sense! It has no holes in it and therefore it needs no tension at all. It doesn't move with the strings. Therefore, the bow can't move to any

I believe that money really is no good when you want it when you really, really want it and you don't want it for an arbitrary amount of time. So, I believe that we can all agree that money should be kept in a secure place, right? This, naturally, means that we should put money in the bank, right? Why, yes we should!<n><n>How should we do this?<n><n>Banks are not good in a way that can be explained in a sentence, they are only helpful for a very specific situation.<n><n>Say you have a problem with your computer. Your computer is broken, right? You could fix it, right? But you're poor and can't afford it, and you really don't know what else to do. What would you do?<n><n>Well, if I were you, I'd probably take out money into the bank, right? This is a terrible thing to do, right? The thing is, we will all probably need money in a time of need. Maybe something happens to your dog, or your car breaks down, or you need money for food. So, you might put money into the bank with the hope that it will be there when you really, really need it. And, of course, that it will be there in a timely manner! But, let's think about that. If my computer breaks down the next day, or if my car dies the next day, does that mean that I'll be able to use my bank account the first day or the second? It might get there, but where can I put money that will stay there for days? In bank accounts that don't have access to cash? Not very likely, and if you think about it, then a bank account would be the safest place for money and be the easiest place for me to take it. In a bank, I could probably place a check next to its cash drawer on the counter, and be sure that all the bills on the other side of it are in the same amount. Or, I could take out my credit card. But there we are once again, in a risky situation, but at least you don't have to go find a

Faust<n><n>If the only thing you have are your memories of the past, how can you know what the future holds? How can you have hope if you don’t even realize that you have one? Why do you need me on your path? If it weren’t for you, I’d be just another sad story. I’m the only one who cares. Who knows, maybe some day, something good will happen to me. Maybe I’ll be able to show my sister that she was chosen for this life, just like you were. Maybe I’m going to find someone that I really love, have that family that we only read about in books. Maybe, sometime, I may even meet my own future sister or grandfather. Perhaps, someday, I will become worthy of you by sharing the gospel with others. Or maybe, just maybe, I’ll do something great and amazing with my life to share your life with them, too. - Russell Moore<n><n>When children feel sad for no evident reason, parents tend to worry and try to make the child feel better. When children become angry, parents must be the ones to calm them down, and they themselves become angry. When people feel the need to get their feelings out and express their emotions, they begin to feel the need to lash out at those around them. That is why it is important to have the correct amount of patience. We must learn not to allow our anger, or any negative emotion for that matter, to get out of control.<n><n>In what ways are you afraid? Is it anxiety, worry, frustration, depression, or tension? What is the main reason? How do you deal with fear?<n><n>Fear of judgment is a common reaction to suffering and oppression. When you feel trapped in the middle of your own suffering, the fear that has been brewing for a long time can overtake you, and you will feel helpless and helpless. Your conscience will tell you that you have done something wrong, and how can you help the people around you when they are afraid to tell you the truth? That is when you start to

Choices:  A: mobile phone B: wristwatch C: briefcase D: office E: desktop<n>Output:		1-8 digit numbers can be represented by either A, B or C. This calculation is done as 7, 6, and 5 digit numbers.<n>Input: 2. What is the last digit of the sum of two sets of numbers?<n>Output: 2. Let’s suppose that we have 7 sets of numbers A, B, and C. These sets of numbers consist of 2 numbers from each group. Give one number of each set as a decimal sum from 1 to 7 inclusive, then the remainder of each group as a fractional sum from 7 to 2 inclusive and 3 and above inclusive. For example, if we have 11 numbers A, B, C and 7 numbers D, E, F, G, and H, then 7/11 = 0, 2/11 = 1, 1/11 = 0, and 3/11 = 0.<n>Output: In the input case a number must be represented in a numerical format, and each group has only 2 numbers. The remainder from each group must be divided 3times by its numerator and subtracted 1 by its denominator. The number obtained from this is then divided 3times by its denominator. In the output case a number must be separated from each other. The first digit of each group must then be divided by the first number (2*7) of the remaining group. For example, if D is divided by the number 9, then 8*9 = 5 and 7*9 = 7. The numbers 8 and 7 must then be divided in half. 7/5 = 6, so E*5 therefore equals 0.3 and A*5 (=0.3) = 0.4. E*3 = 11, and 5*3 = 3. E*2 = 6, and 1*2 =1. The remainder of the group is then the sum of remaining digits in number A or denominator of A divided by its numerator. So A(13) = 2-17, or 3-40. In this case D2 = 0, and therefore A = 2*17-20 = 1. D2(26) = 8, which yields 10-40. D2(23) = 4, which yields 15-40. A(31) = 16, which yields 15-50. A(44) = 25, which yields 40-80. A(21) = 20, which yields 20-100. A(19) = 15, which yields 15-20. D^1

Schnauzers are inexpensive, affectionate, and playful. They are usually priced at approximately $200, but if you want one for yourself that is cheaper, you can call a local shelter, they might be able to give you a free puppy from time to time, if you live in the right area you could also contact your local veterinarian, they often have special "no charge for puppies" days, and some of the bigger animal hospitals even offer free vaccinations and spay/neuter. If the area where you want to buy a puppy isn't the right area you will want to see if there is a local animal rescue nearby, there may even be one within your close proximity. If you want to adopt the Schnauzer, all they ask is to have a little love in their voice so don't worry about having to train them for years (which they learn through trial and error, and not necessarily through "being a puppy" experience). So, what do you need to do to take care of a puppy? The first thing they must do is learn how to roll over so when you get in trouble they can easily get out of harm's way. They also like to curl up under your legs and get cuddled at bedtime, they are very cuddly when they learn to roll over, they also do well with children, because of their size, your adult children or grandchildren can be very helpful with giving them some attention. They also like to be petted and will often come running to their owner when they find someone in need, they like to cuddle and love to be held! They can be used for all kinds of training, they like to play with toys, when you give them a little tug, they usually pull in one of several directions.<n>They are a great first dog

Choices:  A: house B: fast food restaurant C: library D: conference E: paper<n>Output:		 Choose E.<n>Feeding dogs food and drinking water at tables is the worst way to feed dogs. You must eat your own food. If you like, take your animals into the bathroom and finish your food immediately (they will not come to you). Eating at tables is also bad for the dogs' health, since table scraps are rarely cleaned up and do not last long. Paper scraps are not very good for dogs, since they are so small and not hygienic. If your dog won't come into the bathroom, get up from the table and carry your food out. You can carry your food around with you if you need to use the restroom. There are many more choices.<n>Feeding your dogs food and water while eating their own food is one of the most natural things to do. It is the most natural thing that you and you dog do.

Choices:  A: fingernails B: garden C: corner D: computer E: closet<n>Output:		 Where can I store dirt?<n>There are several surfaces that could be used to store dirt, and one way to tell is by its type. When choosing a soil surface, two things should be considered: what to use and which size to choose.<n><n>To store dirt, the surface area in centimeters is a factor. The larger the surface area, the more dirt per surface. The size of a surface can also determine the type of material used, such as soil and sand. Soil is very stable under most conditions, therefore is the preferred choice for most surface storage. Sand will retain moisture better, so use it for surface storage in very damp locations where soil will absorb water. To store dirt, use a large soil surface or a very small sand surface.<n><n>Subways - the dirt of the car<n>Subways are usually not the ideal choice for surface storage, especially if dirt is to be returned regularly, for example, during a change. Dirt does not stay on the surface of the subway tracks. So, instead of putting a dirt surface on the subways, other surface surfaces could be used instead. Car windows give more surface area, which makes them more suitable for surface storage.<n><n>Carpets - carpet samples<n>Carpet samples are best for surface storage in dry locations. A good size sample also provides more surface area for return to the soil.<n><n>Flooring - carpet samples<n>Most surfaces are best for surface storage when they have a long drying time. Floors will provide a smooth surface and a quick drying time, allowing faster surface storage. Floors will also collect dirt, which won't stay on the surfaces while drying.<n><n>Pets - flea beetles<n>Pets are best used as a substrate for storage of dirt because they are very clean. Pet feces has the potential of damaging other materials in the home, in particular in kitchen areas, and will also collect dirt. Therefore, a small amount of pet feces will allow quick surface storage without damage.<n><n>A person can store dirt with the help of sand. However, sand will attract mud and dirt, both of which can easily damage the sand surface.<n><n>Water - water molecules from rain<n>Water does not remain on any surface that can be stored with sand. One must consider the effects of rain and how storage will change during the use of the surface.<n><n>Dry wood - dried grass or dried grass hay<n>Dry, very light wood is a good surface for surface storage because it does not hold moisture

Choices:  A: revealing information B: being ridiculed C: problems D: more funding E: telling all<n>Output:		 What is the best way to answer this question?<n>Let's take a closer look at each question.<n><n>First let's consider the A and B questions. It can easily be concluded that revealing information would be the most likely reason a business would be going public. This is because businesses have to have money in circulation to have any kind of work to do. This means that most businesses have to seek funds from the public for things like paying taxes, pay their employees, rent, equipment, etc.<n>The most common reason for going public is to provide information to the public about the company that can then encourage more people to invest in the public stock. However, a company going public would still have to have money in order to make this happen. Therefore many companies will go private before starting a public offering in order to maintain profit, as then they would have to do the same work anyway.<n>Similarly, going public only provides a public platform where members can speculate on the companies. However, companies cannot predict the value of their stock, and this risk of not being able to generate profit outweighs this benefit.<n>A public offering allows companies to also present a public image, which in turn helps them to attract investors and potential customers.<n><n>Second let's evaluate E. To begin with, I can understand why a company might want to keep a secret. It isn't really practical to tell all of their employees that they are going public, especially if they are highly paid. This would greatly interfere with their ability to have productive work sessions. The only reason that they need to tell the employees that they have become a public company is so that they can then pay them accordingly.<n><n>However, I also can see why a company would want to tell the employees. Because employees know the value of their stock. Therefore they can potentially get as much money out of it, as they put in. This leads me to my third question: will telling all of their employees cause the company to be ridiculed more than it would have been?<n><n>I find E to be the most likely reason the company would want to tell their employees. By making them aware of their company growing into a public company, they can then take advantage of the possibility of greater profits being generated and greater opportunities for expansion.<n><n>Now let me ask you a question: what is the best way to respond to these questions? I believe the answer is simple. Be kind and not be judgmental, especially to those who are in high-pressure situations.<n><n>If you

Choices:  A: two feet B: two ears C: horns D: lay eggs E: one head<n>Output:		 five feet<n><n>The reason I give the answer of five feet is because Doberman puppies are four pairs of paws with one open leg between the two ears, not two feet with one open leg between two ears. The ears will not be touching each other on both of the paws.<n><n>In regards to Schnauzers, they all have either one head or one horn. They will all have a tuft of fur on their right eye. They also have some sort of an extra ear on the left, I believe, also called a "knee" and that ear is part of the tail.<n><n>The second question asked if the two heads could make an animal. They can't. The two heads have nothing in common with one another.<n><n>What are they supposed to look like?<n><n>Answer:<n>There are two ways they could look like. If they have all the bones in the center, then it should appear to them that they are the same as a person. If they still have the bones in the center of the head, and their hair is the same hair as the person, then it should look like a person. (It would appear human like, but not human like.) If they have all the bone, hair color, and appearance that they have now, then it should be a different animal. This is why I give the answer "five feet" which is consistent with both answers.<n><n>What is the difference between this question and the one asking what colors humans are supposed to be?<n><n>Answer:There are two ways they can look like. If they still have bones in the center, and their hair is not the same as person's hair, then it must look like a person. I believe it looks like a person with all the hair and bones because they have bones, bones, hair, and hair. It would not look like a person without them because they still have them. They are still humans. If they have all hair and bones, then their head should look like the person. A person without bones.<n><n>So do any of the answers count?<n><n>Nope. There should only be one answer. The only answer is the one the question asks...

She is very friendly and affectionate.<n>Charlie lives at a rescue shelter. There is no picture of Charlie but there is a picture of me. She is named after Charlie Brown and I am named after Charlie Chaplin.<n>We adopted Charlie before we had names. I am named after myself. Charlie was chosen ahead of me for a reason. Charlie has some issues that aren't that severe because she's a rescue dog. She has to be supervised all the time and has been for a very long time. Our other dog, Kona, is called "Frozen" because he will freeze to death. Charlie never freezes to death and she's never had a surgery. We decided that we wanted a named dog and decided to choose "Charlie".<n>Charlie and I are very close and that's great because with having Charlie I will not be bored with my dog. In most cases the dogs left at the shelters have been abandoned because they've been abandoned by their owners. That's not the case with Charlie. Charlie was adopted from a rescue center by a lady from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. There are pictures on the website of Charlie. The name comes from her being called "Charlie White" instead of Charlie Brown because of her white color.<n>Charlie needs to be a part of a home where she is the only dog because if there is more than one dog the other dogs will want to fight each other about who gets to play with Charlie. A home with a dog named Charlie is not a home with a fight between dogs because the dog won't be there alone but she is with a group of dogs that will be a good play environment for her

The total number is n.  Suppose there are 4,000 people, how many of them are alive and the others are dead.<n>Output: 2,000 live<n>Assume every person is in good health. There are 8,000 people in the party, so if they all died at the same time you need 4,000 people to be alive. This works out to 2,000 live if everyone is alive or 8,000 if every person is dead.<n>The most significant thing to consider here is how difficult it will be to keep everyone alive. At one dinner people may talk about wanting to have kids, but as long as they don't talk about it with everyone else then they won't have to worry about it. However, the last dinner party that I was at had several people who had not had kids and they talked about it constantly. They even talked about the fact that they wanted to start having kids and not wait until marriage or birth.<n>For a party of 8,000 people this seems impossible to actually happen since people would have to spend hours together every day and it takes a long time for a party to get together. If all that happened was that the last person in the party died everyone on the other party would feel like they were doomed. If people really wanted kids and wanted to keep them all alive and well they could work it out but I do not know anyone who really wants kids.

There are so many good things about it and when I read it as an English lit. graduate student in high school, my classmates loved being able to discuss which was the “most important” or most “interesting”. One of my favorite parts was that one of the characters would sometimes make a comment about how he could get an old lady to tell him about her past life, such that “she” must be a woman, or at least that she was a girl that died when she was about 10. Later, however, the reader learns that the main character’s name is really Atticus Finch, and the old lady was actually Mammy Tom. This makes Mammy Tom one of my all-time favorite character names!

I've been trying it, and my legs aren't strong enough to do much more than simply squatting, and it hasn't helped my quads, either, which is what is the limiting factor of my weight training so far. But I want to make sure I at least try that exercise before I invest in a new exercise for legs.<n><n>So my question is, does anyone have any advice on the best way to do this exercise, and would you believe there are ways to do it without actually lifting your upper arms? And are there any other good exercises to do with no bar on your back, other than squats that won't make me look like a retarded monkey trying to squat?<n><n>The best I can think of to lift your arms is to bend one back and look at an imaginary line (where the bar is placed), look down your body, and lift them up in that direction. I don't see why you need to hold the bar (or anything barbed) on your back.<n><n>Can anyone suggest any other exercises to do, such as deadlift for legs? I also read somewhere

The average number of puppies produced in a lifetime by a woman and a man is 2.2 (for American Shorthairs and American Bulldogs). Most of the dogs that live in the United States each year are of two or fewer different breeds. For the average woman, that would mean a total of 9.5 dogs. On the other hand, for the average woman, only two breeds of dogs would be capable of producing many more puppies than her. That would be the American Pit Bull Terriers and the Labrador Retriever. To produce 12 dogs, the American Pit Bull Terrier or Labrador Retriever would produce only nine puppies. (That is, 11.5**9=24.5.) That would mean the Labrador Retriever would have to produce twelve times the number of puppies, the American Pit Bull terrier would have to produce thirteen times the number of puppies and the American Pit Bull Terri...<n>Output:For the average woman, a German Shepherd dog produces only two pups.

Choices:  A: fearless B: english carrier C: courageous D: brave E: achromatic<n>Output:		 Bold, bolder, bolder, boldest, greatest, greatestest, blackest, greatestest, most dangerous, most beautiful<n>The correct answer is not bold, bolder.<n>There is no association with the opposite of something. Bold, bolder, and boldest are three different things. Bold is a good adjective, bolder is a bad adjective. Boldest is a good adjective, and boldest is a bad adjective. But these are not different things.<n>There is no associative relationship of two of a kind. Bold is the opposite of bolder, bolder is the opposite of greatestest, boldestest is the opposite of blackest. Boldest is good, boldest is bad.<n>But bold is not an "opposite" of something. It is an adverb, it is a phrase, and it is not a verb. Bold is not the same as boldest. Bold can become bolder, bolder can become bolder, but they are not the same. Bold cannot become bolder and bold cannot become the opposite of bold. Bold is not an oppositive of bold, bolder is not the opposite of greatestest. Bold is a noun, bolder is a verb by defintion.

The lines are either parallel or perpendicular. For example, if a line made from one point A and one point B, and A and B are parallel, when two lines A and B intersect, the lines are perpendicular, and, therefore, have the same width. So, a perpendicular line has half the width of a parallel line. If a line made from two points A and B, but not parallel to one another, is perpendicular to a line made from at least two points A, B and the horizontal line is half distance from the two points A and B. Then, that line is horizontal, so that line is perpendicular to the former. A line made from a point A and one point C is horizontal. Therefore, C/A is half the distance from A and C. Two lines of the same sign intersect each other, but they have the same width. They are parallel. Therefore, they have similar numbers on either side of their intersection. And two lines of the same sign can also be perpendicular - each has half the width of the former. When two lines intersect, they are perpendicular. So two lines of a given sign are equivalent. A line that is perpendicular to another perpendicular line is called parallel. If a line is parallel to two lines, and one of those lines is perpendicular to another line, then they are parallel to each other.<n>Input:What is a diamond?<n>Output:A diamond is a solid.<n>Input:When you see two parallel lines, you know they are different colors, because each has half of the wavelength. If two lines are perpendicular, you know they are not different colors at all. But if they intersect

He felt that the alternative might have results that were too what? Choices:  A: eternal B: religious C: unpredictable D: holy E: monastic<n>Output:		James didn't know what to say, and thought about it for a few days.<n>Finally, he decided to give the AI a secular upbringing using the following code:<n>Input:  A.M. - Christian<n>Output:  J.M. - Nonbeliever<n><n>This is the second time I have been to your forum. Can you please give me any tips you have received during this process that will make the job easier?<n><n>Answer: It really depends who has been helping or what that person thinks is the best answer. The best choice might, by the way be completely different than someone else thinks. You can say the same thing about some of the options. What the code is trying to achieve is balance.<n><n>If someone says you should have a Christian as a character. If I ask to clarify what “A.M.” means then you are only going to answer “A.M” then the answer might be A.M. -Christian<n>If someone tells you why you should make your character a non-believer instead of a believer then what they are trying to get across is that it is more realistic.<n>If someone tells you not to make your character a believer, say A.M. - Non believer, then you might say A.M. Non believer<n>If someone tells you that non-believers are a bad choice for the character. The best answer is A.M. - believer<n>One or more of the alternatives could be better than the other. When you get asked a question you need to think the answer through. This is what the AI can help with. Not only can it show you the pros and cons but also give you ways to avoid making an answer which is detrimental to the character. We do not assume any of the answers are good or bad. The more you discuss the answer and think about it the better the character will turn out.<n>One of the advantages of having the AI help you is that unlike human programmers they don't need to be trained to make the most logical decision. They aren't programmed to follow the moral code set forth by the creator of the character. They don't have to try to balance the good and the bad or consider the options which other people don't.<n>One of the biggest disadvantages is that the player cannot interact with the AI. That means they cannot say: “I think the only reason to have a non-believer is for realism.” They don't have to have

Choices:  A: grill B: go to market C: bring home fish D: eat hamburger E: make bread<n>Output:		 Five hamburgers is 60 pounds of hamburger<n>Let's assume that the hamburger is not the most expensive choice but the least expensive choice. One way to be able to get rid of hamburger is to burn it. Let's say, for example, that there are ten hamburgers and one can cost 50 cfr or more. If one burns the whole 10 hamburger, the other nine hamburgers would be consumed within a few hours.<n>Let's also assume that the hamburgers are served with a small plastic plate that holds a single hamburger. Then, it would take one hour to consume that food. One hamburger, therefore, has to be cut into 5 pieces in order to be consumed in one hour. Let's say that the hamburger is five times the amount of hamburger that would consume if the whole ten hamburger is consumed at once.<n>Each hamburger equals one hamburger meal (one hamburger is equal to 5 hamburgers). This requires cutting into 5 hamburgers, therefore, 60 hamburgers is 60 hamburgers per person.<n>Then let's say that the consumption of the whole 10 hamburger requires one hour. That means that 60 hamburgers per day equals a hamburger meal every day for the past two years. This means that there are 600 hamburgers per year. If every hamburger is destroyed, there is 600 hamburgers left. This can result in serious health problems. So, to help with this problem, it is recommended that the waste from two hamburgers be taken away from the hamburgers. And the hamburger is to be consumed more slowly. If there is no longer any wasted hamburgers left, then 60 hamburgers in 2 years equals 10 hamburgers per year = 60 hamburgers per year for the next two years. This is, therefore, enough hamburgers in a day to meet the needs of any person for two years.<n>Let's assume that 10 hamburgers a day equals 20 hamburgers per day (100 hamburgers per year). Let's say that the value per hamburger of any person is one dollar. The number of hamburgers per person is 100 hamburgers per year, therefore, if hamburgers per person can no longer be counted, the dollar value per hamburger as per meal is $1. That is, the total number of hamburgers consumed per month is $10. The dollar value per hamburger for the month

The airplane crashed in to the ground after 5 minutes. It seemed to take forever for the body to be cut from the fuselage, what happened?<n>Output: D was correct  While it initially seemed like it took a long time, the body was not severed into pieces. (The dead man's body was pulled out, the seat belt was removed, and then the body was laid in the middle of the plane. A plane takes about 7 minutes to fly 5.5 miles.)<n>Output: C was correct with option

Even though there is a higher risk of death, you will also be doing more useful work for yourself (such as slowing down for other drivers) or having better weather. The risk of death is the worst of the choices. You are more likely to do useful work and less likely to kill someone in a headwind.<n>Fog and flood-swept ground are more dangerous but doing work also benefits those who drive in flood-swept ground. If you can drive safely in either area, then driving in flood-swept could be better for you as it could be an alternative driving location to your normal one. You are also safer, allowing yourself to do more worthwhile work.<n><n>Input: Your car has had an oil spill in it in the past year. You can only add or remove 10 units of oil every 6 months.

There will be a prompt sheet before the final exam where you can look over for any words or phrases that you have not read before. The answers are on the top of the sheet in bold. Do not start from the top of the sheet. At the end of each essay, enter in a three second word or phrase which sums to zero. If it cannot be entered into the sheet, try to explain why in the following essay if possible.<n><n>The Doberman puppy is unique in the way that its behavior is a reflection of the owners. The dog has an inherent drive to please its owner to the level of distraction. This does not mean that we have to accept an endless source of attention but that we must take care to give the animal as much attention as it wants. When it is not feeling well in some way, it is easy to see the owners as a source of constant pressure. However, this is just a reflection of how the puppy was brought into this world and it is no excuse for bad behavior. One of the characteristics that we have developed is the need for discipline and obedience. Not only is the Doberman puppy an obedient dog but it is also a very intelligent one. This means that as he grows and has more experience, the puppy may begin to express feelings of wanting to do what he wants without a valid reason. It is possible that this can have an effect on the owners who do not know how to adjust their behavior appropriately. It is not appropriate to bring a dog to a party where the owner is not present. It is also important to realize that sometimes the Doberman puppy is able to make the owners give him attention due to its own need for attention. If you are the kind of dog owner with the habit of making your dog the center of attention at all times, this may be a cause of frustration for the dog. You must not accept criticism from the dog unless it is in a very calm way. There will always be an element of frustration in everything that exists in life. The

Choices:  A: board ship B: shout at C: smile at D: cross street E: feel happy<n>Output:		 The following two equations are used when you want to get the attention of a room. The two equations were written to illustrate the first principle of probability analysis and have a small range. The equation for how hard to shout at that person is given as 5. So there are 5 different equations given. When a person is standing near a piece of board there is a 50% chance that at least one person will look towards him. The person standing closest to the board is given as s<n>S stands for standing closest to the board.<n>The person who stands closest to the board (s) has a 50% chance to get the attention of anyone in the room.<n><n>Input:There are 7 people in a room. Each person has $6 in hand. One of them, Charlie, is sitting on a chair at the far end of the room with a note at his desk asking the other people to each pay him the same in cash. When you enter the room, pay each person $6. If one of the people doesn't pay you, you don't have to pay them anything. If one person pays you more than you did, you don't pay them anything. If someone doesn't respond, you give him all of your change to hold, and you get him an envelope in exchange.<n>Output: All but Charlie pay $6. Charlie pays himself $6. You hold $2 and get $2. Charlie gives you $2, and you hand him an envelope in exchange for holding $2. When Charlie gets to his desk, he takes $2 from the envelope, looks at it, and gives you half of the money from his pocket. The other people pay $6, all of them give Charlie $2, and Charlie gives them all the rest of their change (their $2 in change), so each person gets $6 in cash, and you get nothing.<n>Charlie keeps all of his change.<n>You give him a box in return for all his change. The envelope is now empty.<n>When this is over, Charlie pays himself $12, the other people get $3 each and $1 each from Charlie. The total received by Charlie is $18, which is equal to (6+6)^3.<n>We give Charlie the envelope in the end. When Charlie is done, we give him an envelope after reading the note on it. When we say goodbye, we put the envelope back in his pocket.

To learn it just look it up in the dictionary.<n><n>Now you must know how the name of the breed is to be pronounced. Just like all breed names, it will often differ from person to person, and with each different name, it may look different. For example, if the name is "Cocker Spaniel", it may differ from person to person. "Shih Tzu" or "Shih Ta", are all good pronunciations. However, some people pronounce "English Setter" as "Setter". It is good to know how to pronounce the breed name.<n><n>The breed is given by the number of dogs. For example, if you have a German Shepherd, and you choose the English Setter, then you must know how to pronounce the German Shepherd's name. For example, G-E-S-H-T-I-S, or "Hats", are both good names.<n><n>If the name of the breed was spelled out, but did not have the proper pronunciation, you may not be able to remember it.<n><n>You should also know what is a Schnauzer. A Schnauzer must be able to stand on four legs. It is also known by the name "Dutch Shepherd Dog"<n><n>Since this program is geared toward young children, it does not contain many of the information you would need

The temperature hasn't been right for a while.  They were hoping it would be warmer.  They were hoping for summertime weather.  They have had springtime weather for almost every previous year they have lived in Pennsylvania.  They are not certain they are getting the summer they were hoping for.  They believe they should go to a doctor immediately.  The doctor feels they need to be checked for cancer as well as a few other conditions.  The doctors believe that they must go back to Pennsylvania after taking them to Los Angeles to go to the right specialist  to get the answers they are needing to improve their overall health  However, John feels that he should drive to New York with the family to see the doctor and possibly get some answers of their own.  John doesn't feel that he is ready for an airplane trip with this level of stress.  The family has a nice car for their trip to New York.  After the doctors are done with Jim he will return back to Pennsylvania along with his family and go to the doctor there.  They feel that they can't afford to have Jim in his present state with the family there.<n>Output:Jim feels that it is too late to go to a specialist to have the answers he needs.

They wanted to do it with colored crayons. At the end of the week, they asked you "Daddy, why do your crayons need colored crayons?" At first, you said you didn't know, but when you asked them to explain what they meant by colored crayons the only thing the kid said was "Crayon colours". You asked again, and the child explained that the crayons were green, yellow, pink, orange, red, blue as well as in between. When he finally went to bed that night his tired brain came up with a simple yet profound idea: You only needed 3 crayons to make a colour wheel. You told him not to tell anyone, and to draw the picture using only those crayons. He sat and drew the picture slowly and carefully and you watched him and he drew much more. It was as if the picture had just been painted on his mind. As he finished he saw it and said "Daddy you can still do this? Can I still paint this picture?"<n>When you talked to him later, he insisted that you needed only 3 crayons; you were all wrong. You needed 6 crayons to make the wheel of colour, but only 3 crayons to draw the picture. The crayon numbers are 4, 3, two, then one, in the sequence from right to left. When you asked him to go back and draw again using only those crayon numbers, he said that only needed 3 crayon numbers again, but only 3 craysons to paint the picture. When you questioned him again he told you that he had never counted. He said that you "had" only 3 crayons.<n>When you confronted him he said that he couldn't remember counting. You told him his memory was faulty. He said "You can't fool me!" You said "You see I knew all along, and all you did was pretend."<n>You said "You just didn't want to admit it."<n>A few days after you gave up on him, he was playing with his cousins and asked to paint his own wheels of colour. When you asked him why he needed to use the colour

Choices: A: go to the library B: find out people with whom you already have ties C: find out people you want people to ask D: find out people who are being proposed to E: ask people around you<n>Output: A Tying in with the question from the beginning, I would give most to going to the library, but if I were to ask people I knew this information would be helpful, because they probably know others who I would ask before going library, because we see people around them all the time.<n>I would recommend finding someone you know or have a strong relationship with before going to the library.<n><n>In this passage, we are considering people who know other people. For them, there must be a certain level of familiarity with their potential future partners. A person who knows someone else has a better chance of being able to recommend someone to be engaged than one who is only known by a few people. The more people who know someone well, the greater chance they are of having recommendations for their future spouse. I think finding out who to ask would be a step in that direction. You can look through people you know well when it comes to their wedding planning, to find out about the same sort of people who might be good for getting engaged.<n>In this passage, I would want to know about relationships you have with people you already know! If you knew somebody very well, you already had the information needed, so you didn't have a lot of trouble getting out of the relationship.<n><n>What is the most common question people ask in marriage negotiations? Choices: A: going to the library B: finding out people with whom you have ties C: finding out people you want people out ask D: finding out people who are being asked E: finding out people who you can get involved with.<n>Output: A Tied in with answer on the right, the most common question is what type of person they are looking to marry. They know what they want, they have a relationship with a family member, or at least know somebody who knows someone who is getting married. They have a general idea what they want and will likely be able to give you details about who they have seen or talked to.<n>I would want to know if they were asking people to ask someone who they want to ask, and if they had any family members in their

Choices:  A: pocket B: shower C: chemist D: drug store E: shaving kit<n>Output:		If it's pocket, it gets stored in the front pocket. Shower and chemist store are obvious storage places. Drug store is likely to be for shaving kit.<n><n>To figure out what the answer is, take the following into consideration:<n>1. People who use razor blades in their pocket rarely run into a problem where they need to know how many of them to carry.<n>2. People who use razor blade as shaving kit usually carry a small bag to hold the blades (for obvious reasons).<n>3. People who usually use razor blades as shaving kit seldom make purchases where they need to know the final number of razor blades.<n>4. People who use razorblade as shaving kit tend to carry a small bag, usually to place it on the belt.<n><n>To figure it out, use the following:<n>1.

If five people were going to go to a movie, 2 would go to a double feature, 1 to a double feature and 2 to a double feature alone. 1 would be willing to share the movie cost on a first-come, first-served basis. 2 would be willing to share 50 cents extra if they got to decide which movie to see. 3 would be willing to share 5 cents extra on the double feature if they could choose one movie and they got to see two of the movies on offer. 4 would only be willing to share 50% of the price of a double feature if they could both choose one movie.<n>6. The average cost for a double feature ticket is $15. 2 could share their tickets 50% of the time and 1 could share their tickets 100% of the time. The average cost of a double feature ticket is not 2-3 times less than 1, so we can assume that 5 would share their tickets 50% and 1 would share their tickets 100%. The average cost of a movie is 35 cents, so we can assume 2 would share their ticket 50% of the time.<n><n>Output:<n>

(I'm guessing, I don't have a scale).<n>Output:<n>A: Dice set B: Strategy C=2 dice C=smaller dice dice D: 3 dice<n>A dice set is just 2 pieces and an extra 3 pieces to store the dice.  It takes a couple of seconds to put a set together then put it back together.  A 3d2t is about the size of a football and takes about 2 minutes to put together and store.  Once you store it with a little effort you can play one game without opening it.  Now if you like to store your games, you could probably keep a couple dozen pieces in storage.  If you go 3d4t then it would probably take more like 8-10 pieces to store.   You'll also probably get better and better.  The average player would probably get to about 2 hours to 3 hours of gameplay before having to store his set.  You can either buy several sets and place it in a box or just keep them in your house.

Choices:  A: happiness B: relaxation C: create music D: sadness E: loud noises<n>Output:		  A: happiness D: relaxation E: create music F: sadness<n>What would happen if you are not good? When you are not good you are not happy, but when you are not good, happiness comes as your answer.<n>Let me give you an example; my friend is very good or at the very least very good at guitar, and when he isn't playing he is so happy to be playing the guitar. When he's not playing he is sad and sometimes angry. This makes him very sad and very angry. I'm sure you see where I'm going with this right? This makes him really sad and angry and depressed. He starts playing the guitar to distract himself but the guitar is not like the violin. It is not a relaxing instrument, but rather it is a depressing one. It is the same sadness that he had been feeling the last few days. It is the same kind of sadness that he suffered from when he didn't play the guitar. This is the same kind of feelings that he had been having this whole time.<n>When he is not playing the guitar, he is sad and angry and does not feel well. All that he wants is for the guitar to help to make him feel better because he feels so bad all the time. It is almost like he is trying to escape something that doesn't exist: he is just pretending that he has forgotten or forgotten what happened. He knows that whatever he is trying to forget is still in that person's memory, but he just doesn't seem to really want to let go of it even if he knew that he should. It wouldn't ever be better than the situation that he lives in, so he just doesn't even let himself think about it. He starts doing things that he doesn't like to do in order to let himself cope with the feelings that is not pleasant to think about, but he is never truly happy. He starts having a lot of troubles and he keeps thinking that if he just plays more guitar things will be better. It causes more problems for him since he can't concentrate in class anymore since he is busy thinking about those feelings. He has been a lot closer to the verge of suicide because he has wanted to be like the guitar, but he didn't want to take the steps to get there because he wasn't sure that it was what he wanted to do. The feeling of happiness was a temporary relief, but the feelings of sadness were more permanent until one day he was playing guitar again only to realize that no matter how much he tried

Choices:  A: satisfied B: unnecessary C: luxury D: sufficient E: extra<n>Output:		 You can get everything from C without being satisfied or by not having E.<n>Let's say you have nothing to get, but you still want to learn.<n>The number of things you can get while not being satisfied with E and yet being satisfied with D depends on d.<n>Five less than three less than three times the two times the two times the number of Schnauzer puppies plus the difference between s and s*s is equal to s-20<n>Your final answer is s+35=9<n>The result would be s+35<55>9<n>Now what? Just look at it this way: s+35>55=<55-5>9>9>25<n><n>Input:Find the right answer for a question. The question is: what is the sum of all terms that begin with the letter P?<n>Output:What is the sum of all things that begin with the letter C?<n>Let us assume that you have C(a+b)=7 and P(c+d)=5. Let’s say if you had to choose any 3 out of a set of 9, which 3 do you choose?<n>So far, you have been looking at two things which are one thing and one thing plus one thing.<n>Now we want you to look at P and C and see their sum.<n>Input:What is the sum from P to C?<n>Output:What sum is from C to P?<n>Let us now assume that P1 and P2 do not equal P because they contain different parts and since they do not equal one another, you must have more parts. Then what is the sum of P1 and P2?<n>So far, when you took P, you looked at its sum. Now we want you to look P2 and P3 and see which 3 out of a set are equal to P because we want you to be able to pick P2.<n>So we have P1(c+d)=2(a<b) and P2(s<t)=2(b<c) and P3(s<w)=2(c<d) and the three of them must be equal to P2 because they are both equal parts of P1.<n>The sum from P1 to P2 is P2(t<w)=2(d<t)<n>So the final P2 is P2 (a==b<c<i)<n>The final P3 is P3 (b

Well, his opinion is certainly welcome and he would certainly be the first one to know... but he could tell I was anxious, depressed, had a hard time sleeping, and maybe other things.... Maybe if I had my own place I would be more open about my problems, but I can't get enough money to keep me here on a full time basis, not to mention my husband and son in law do not approve of me coming here.

Anybody who leaves more than 2 posts per day probably shouldn't do it. Not all people will be able to afford to keep this going without a major financial assistance. I know people can sometimes be more involved than they think they should be, but I think if someone is coming in and leaving as often as they come in,

It means that we can still control our nervous system when we are in stress.

It's like when you need to understand your current problem is different than earlier.<n>Fighting is fighting because some of the solutions we come up with might hurt other people.<n><n>Here's an example why someone would be wet after being full and the way I think they would think. The kid knows that the teacher is really mean, or it's a teacher who doesn't like them, but doesn't understand why. The kid is scared at school, but isn't scared at home, because he is the center of attention. The idea is that the kid can't concentrate as well on school, and may become a bad student because of it. It's easier to stop working after something like this than after school.<n><n>I have to agree with the teacher that I was in school with. She was nice, but there wasn't any way to deal with any of it. She understood the kid because she dealt with a lot of the problems, but as soon as she got into things she had to pull control back in. I think she felt the same way. She was good at teaching, but she had a hard time with the fact that she was a parent, or cared deeply about any kid she was responsible for. She had a hard time pulling back and leaving it alone.

Choices:  A: relaxation B: exhaustion C: energetic D: become stronger E: use energy<n>Output:		Exercisings exercise more than relaxing<n>Answer: The total number of puppies can't possibly fit into a box but the number of puppies in one box is 20. The average amount of puppies per female is 10, which would make 20 puppies in a box. But if you took the box out of the equation and instead looked at the total number of puppies, you find that the average is 20 puppies, as the total number of puppies is 20. That's right—exercising immediately leads to more than just relaxation—it stimulates energy! This is why exercising can sometimes feel like a workout!

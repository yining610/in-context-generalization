Your first job is to start lining up all your stuff. Your second job is to be the driver. The third job has to be a secret from the other drivers.  Then you take a ten minute break for lunch. As you hurry along the traffic you look over at the other drivers and you can see that even though they appear to be driving on their breaks they are really really not.  There are fifteen cars between you and the end point. Your fourth job is to drive the limo without hitting any of the people riding in their cars. Your fifth job is to be in the back seat riding with the driver. Your sixth job is to drive the car so fast to keep the people in the cars from falling out of it. Your seventh job has to be a taxi driver. Your last job is the escort lady.  You have to make your limo go forty miles an hour for the first half-hour and sixty miles an hour for the second half-hour.  All your work is worth less than that - unless they happen to find a bomb or something, in which case you get paid $2,500. After the limo is done, you must return to the limo on foot and you have to turn over all the keys.  Then you get to call someone to come pick up your limo and that person gets $100,000.  So your work is worth $100,000 * $35.00 per minute, per mile, per hour. It is the job of the limo driver - that, and to avoid hurting the people in the cars - that leads to the pay.

{"text": "Nothing will happen to skin\nIn the heat of a situation, a human would expect to feel things that are not supposed to. We would expect things not to feel things that aren't supposed to feel things. That's why there is no skin pinch when a mosquito bites.\nIn any situation, we have a choice. The choices we make can affect the situation and the consequences of those choices can affect us. When we make choices, we make a choice regarding how we will react. In some situations we like things to be certain. When we don't we like things to be uncertain. When we don't like it we don't want to feel it happen. So in trying to avoid a lot of stuff happening, we tend to act on our preferences, we don't want to act on our preferences.\nIn your situation, you would feel something if it happened and you would choose to not feel it, because you prefer your hand not feel something happen. This means that the number of choices that you make determines the number of results. The more choices you make, the more likelihood there is that something will happen.\nThe more options that you have, the more likelihood there will be a lot of stuff that happens. So you tend to tend to do something that you don't like.\nIn your situation if you didn't choose to not feel the skin, then you wouldn't feel anything and you wouldn't want things to happen in your favour. So when you make more options you make a choice about how you will react to that choice and what it will be. When things happen, they are what they are, they're a part of your experience. You don't really care that they're there. If anything, you probably like them more to be present. That's why we like things to be as they are. Our choices, when we make choices are just the things that happen. They are just part of our experience. You don't need to worry much about them.", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}

I believe that money really is no good when you want it when you really, really want it and you don't want it for an arbitrary amount of time.

Maybe something happens to your dog, or your car breaks down, or you need money for food. So, you might put money into the bank with the hope that it will be there when you really, really need it. And, of course, that it will be there in a timely manner! But, let's think about that. If my computer breaks down the next day, or if my car dies the next day, does that mean that I'll be able to use my bank account the first day or the second? It might get there, but where can I put money that will stay there for days? In bank accounts that don't have access to cash? Not very likely, and if you think about it, then a bank account would be the safest place for money and be the easiest place for me to take it. In a bank, I could probably place a check next to its cash drawer on the counter, and be sure that all the bills on the other side of it are in the same amount. Or, I could take out my credit card.

What is the last digit of the sum of two sets of numbers?\nOutput: 2. Let\u2019s suppose that we have 7 sets of numbers A, B, and C. These sets of numbers consist of 2 numbers from each group. Give one number of each set as a decimal sum from 1 to 7 inclusive, then the remainder of each group as a fractional sum from 7 to 2 inclusive and 3 and above inclusive. For example, if we have 11 numbers A, B, C and 7 numbers D, E, F, G, and H, then 7/11 = 0, 2/11 = 1, 1/11 = 0, and 3/11 = 0.\nOutput: In the input case a number must be represented in a numerical format, and each group has only 2 numbers. The remainder from each group must be divided 3times by its numerator and subtracted 1 by its denominator. The number obtained from this is then divided 3times by its denominator. In the output case a number must be separated from each other. The first digit of each group must then be divided by the first number (2*7) of the remaining group. For example, if D is divided by the number 9, then 8*9 = 5 and 7*9 = 7. The numbers 8 and 7 must then be divided in half. 7/5 = 6, so E*5 therefore equals 0.3 and A*5 (=0.3) = 0.4. E*3 = 11, and 5*3 = 3. E*2 = 6, and 1*2 =1. The remainder of the group is then the sum of remaining digits in number A or denominator of A divided by its numerator. So A(13) = 2-17, or 3-40. In this case D2 = 0, and therefore A = 2*17-20 = 1. D2(26) = 8, which yields 10-40. D2(23) = 4, which yields 15-40. A(31) = 16, which yields 15-50. A(44) = 25, which yields 40-80.

Schnauzers are inexpensive, affectionate, and playful. They are usually priced at approximately $200, but if you want one for yourself that is cheaper, you can call a local shelter, they might be able to give you a free puppy from time to time, if you live in the right area you could also contact your local veterinarian, they often have special \"no charge for puppies\" days, and some of the bigger animal hospitals even offer free vaccinations and spay/neuter. If the area where you want to buy a puppy isn't the right area you will want to see if there is a local animal rescue nearby, there may even be one within your close proximity. If you want to adopt the Schnauzer, all they ask is to have a little love in their voice so don't worry about having to train them for years (which they learn through trial and error, and not necessarily through \"being a puppy\" experience). So, what do you need to do to take care of a puppy? The first thing they must do is learn how to roll over so when you get in trouble they can easily get out of harm's way. They also like to curl up under your legs and get cuddled at bedtime, they are very cuddly when they learn to roll over, they also do well with children, because of their size, your adult children or grandchildren can be very helpful with giving them some attention. They also like to be petted and will often come running to their owner when they find someone in need, they like to cuddle and love to be held! They can be used for all kinds of training, they like to play with toys, when you give them a little tug, they usually pull in one of several directions.\nThey are a great first dog", "answer": "D: front porch"}

{"text": "Where can I store dirt?\nThere are several surfaces that could be used to store dirt, and one way to tell is by its type. When choosing a soil surface, two things should be considered: what to use and which size to choose.\n\nTo store dirt, the surface area in centimeters is a factor. The larger the surface area, the more dirt per surface. The size of a surface can also determine the type of material used, such as soil and sand. Soil is very stable under most conditions, therefore is the preferred choice for most surface storage. Sand will retain moisture better, so use it for surface storage in very damp locations where soil will absorb water. To store dirt, use a large soil surface or a very small sand surface.\n\nSubways - the dirt of the car\nSubways are usually not the ideal choice for surface storage, especially if dirt is to be returned regularly, for example, during a change. Dirt does not stay on the surface of the subway tracks. So, instead of putting a dirt surface on the subways, other surface surfaces could be used instead. Car windows give more surface area, which makes them more suitable for surface storage.\n\nCarpets - carpet samples\nCarpet samples are best for surface storage in dry locations. A good size sample also provides more surface area for return to the soil.\n\nFlooring - carpet samples\nMost surfaces are best for surface storage when they have a long drying time. Floors will provide a smooth surface and a quick drying time, allowing faster surface storage. Floors will also collect dirt, which won't stay on the surfaces while drying.\n\nPets - flea beetles\nPets are best used as a substrate for storage of dirt because they are very clean. Pet feces has the potential of damaging other materials in the home, in particular in kitchen areas, and will also collect dirt. Therefore, a small amount of pet feces will allow quick surface storage without damage.\n\nA person can store dirt with the help of sand. However, sand will attract mud and dirt, both of which can easily damage the sand surface.\n\nWater - water molecules from rain\nWater does not remain on any surface that can be stored with sand. One must consider the effects of rain and how storage will change during the use of the surface.\n\nDry wood - dried grass or dried grass hay\nDry, very light wood is a good surface for surface storage because it does not hold moisture", "answer": "E: closet"}

{"text": "What is the best way to answer this question?\nLet's take a closer look at each question.\n\nFirst let's consider the A and B questions. It can easily be concluded that revealing information would be the most likely reason a business would be going public. This is because businesses have to have money in circulation to have any kind of work to do. This means that most businesses have to seek funds from the public for things like paying taxes, pay their employees, rent, equipment, etc.\nThe most common reason for going public is to provide information to the public about the company that can then encourage more people to invest in the public stock. However, a company going public would still have to have money in order to make this happen. Therefore many companies will go private before starting a public offering in order to maintain profit, as then they would have to do the same work anyway.\nSimilarly, going public only provides a public platform where members can speculate on the companies. However, companies cannot predict the value of their stock, and this risk of not being able to generate profit outweighs this benefit.\nA public offering allows companies to also present a public image, which in turn helps them to attract investors and potential customers.\n\nSecond let's evaluate E. To begin with, I can understand why a company might want to keep a secret. It isn't really practical to tell all of their employees that they are going public, especially if they are highly paid. This would greatly interfere with their ability to have productive work sessions. The only reason that they need to tell the employees that they have become a public company is so that they can then pay them accordingly.\n\nHowever, I also can see why a company would want to tell the employees. Because employees know the value of their stock. Therefore they can potentially get as much money out of it, as they put in. This leads me to my third question: will telling all of their employees cause the company to be ridiculed more than it would have been?\n\nI find E to be the most likely reason the company would want to tell their employees. By making them aware of their company growing into a public company, they can then take advantage of the possibility of greater profits being generated and greater opportunities for expansion.\n\nNow let me ask you a question: what is the best way to respond to these questions? I believe the answer is simple. Be kind and not be judgmental, especially to those who are in high-pressure situations.\n\nIf you", "answer": "D: more funding"}

Because we have s_1 and s_2 as numbers, we must multiply those numbers by 0.\nFirst, the input is the above numbers so we subtract the amount of Schnauzer given then we use this for the number of Schnaueur given to achieve the answer C.\nNext, we take these numbers for steps 3, 4, and 5 and substitute those numbers together using s_0\nThen, we have to solve the process using s_1 to give the answer D and a little bit of s_2 so that we have s_0 + (s_1 / (s_0 - s_2) * s_0 + s_1 * (s_0 - (s_1 - s_2)) - s_0 - (s0 + s_1 /(s_0 - 3_3))))\nSo the final answer for problem is\n\nInput:The following three are the steps of solving problems\nA are two dogs given the following information:\n\nIn the process of solving a problem, it can be helpful to divide the problem into smaller portions. For example, in problem 10 we can divide the problem into five issues\nA1: The number of Dobermans\nA2: The number of Schnauzers\nA3: The total number of Schnauzers for each dog\nA4: The number of Dobbermans for each", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

{"text": "five feet\n\nThe reason I give the answer of five feet is because Doberman puppies are four pairs of paws with one open leg between the two ears, not two feet with one open leg between two ears. The ears will not be touching each other on both of the paws.\n\nIn regards to Schnauzers, they all have either one head or one horn. They will all have a tuft of fur on their right eye. They also have some sort of an extra ear on the left, I believe, also called a \"knee\" and that ear is part of the tail.\n\nThe second question asked if the two heads could make an animal. They can't. The two heads have nothing in common with one another.\n\nWhat are they supposed to look like?\n\nAnswer:\nThere are two ways they could look like. If they have all the bones in the center, then it should appear to them that they are the same as a person. If they still have the bones in the center of the head, and their hair is the same hair as the person, then it should look like a person. (It would appear human like, but not human like.) If they have all the bone, hair color, and appearance that they have now, then it should be a different animal. This is why I give the answer \"five feet\" which is consistent with both answers.\n\nWhat is the difference between this question and the one asking what colors humans are supposed to be?\n\nAnswer:There are two ways they can look like. If they still have bones in the center, and their hair is not the same as person's hair, then it must look like a person. I believe it looks like a person with all the hair and bones because they have bones, bones, hair, and hair. It would not look like a person without them because they still have them. They are still humans. If they have all hair and bones, then their head should look like the person. A person without bones.\n\nSo do any of the answers count?\n\nNope.

There are 8,000 people in the party, so if they all died at the same time you need 4,000 people to be alive.

The words \u201cTo Kill A Mockingbird\u201d is in fact filled with many interesting facts and interesting stories.

We don\u2019t have to \u201ckill this bird\u201d (to be racist, we mean to kill the birds and their eggs, or to kill the child). Rather than \u201ckill this mockingbird\u201d, one could instead say something like, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him a story about the bird \u2013 that is going to be interesting to him because he thinks he\u2019s better than", "answer": "E: chemistry lab"}

And are there any other good exercises to do with no bar on your back, other than squats that won't make me look like a retarded monkey trying to squat?\n\nThe best I can think of to lift your arms is to bend one back and look at an imaginary line (where the bar is placed), look down your body, and lift them up in that direction. I don't see why you need to hold the bar (or anything barbed) on your back.\n\nCan anyone suggest any other exercises to do, such as deadlift for legs?

The lines are either parallel or perpendicular. For example, if a line made from one point A and one point B, and A and B are parallel, when two lines A and B intersect, the lines are perpendicular, and, therefore, have the same width. So, a perpendicular line has half the width of a parallel line. If a line made from two points A and B, but not parallel to one another, is perpendicular to a line made from at least two points A, B and the horizontal line is half distance from the two points A and B. Then, that line is horizontal, so that line is perpendicular to the former. A line made from a point A and one point C is horizontal. Therefore, C/A is half the distance from A and C. Two lines of the same sign intersect each other, but they have the same width. They are parallel. Therefore, they have similar numbers on either side of their intersection. And two lines of the same sign can also be perpendicular - each has half the width of the former. When two lines intersect, they are perpendicular. So two lines of a given sign are equivalent. A line that is perpendicular to another perpendicular line is called parallel. If a line is parallel to two lines, and one of those lines is perpendicular to another line, then they are parallel to each other.\nInput:What is a diamond?\nOutput:A diamond is a solid.\nInput:When you see two parallel lines, you know they are different colors, because each has half of the wavelength.

If I ask to clarify what \u201cA.M.\u201d means then you are only going to answer \u201cA.M\u201d then the answer might be A.M. -Christian\nIf someone tells you why you should make your character a non-believer instead of a believer then what they are trying to get across is that it is more realistic.\nIf someone tells you not to make your character a believer, say A.M. - Non believer, then you might say A.M. Non believer\nIf someone tells you that non-believers are a bad choice for the character. The best answer is A.M. - believer\nOne or more of the alternatives could be better than the other. When you get asked a question you need to think the answer through. This is what the AI can help with. Not only can it show you the pros and cons but also give you ways to avoid making an answer which is detrimental to the character. We do not assume any of the answers are good or bad. The more you discuss the answer and think about it the better the character will turn out.\nOne of the advantages of having the AI help you is that unlike human programmers they don't need to be trained to make the most logical decision. They aren't programmed to follow the moral code set forth by the creator of the character. They don't have to try to balance the good and the bad or consider the options which other people don't.\nOne of the biggest disadvantages is that the player cannot interact with the AI. That means they cannot say: \u201cI think the only reason to have a non-believer is for realism.\u201d They don't have to have", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

{"text": "Five hamburgers is 60 pounds of hamburger\nLet's assume that the hamburger is not the most expensive choice but the least expensive choice. One way to be able to get rid of hamburger is to burn it. Let's say, for example, that there are ten hamburgers and one can cost 50 cfr or more. If one burns the whole 10 hamburger, the other nine hamburgers would be consumed within a few hours.\nLet's also assume that the hamburgers are served with a small plastic plate that holds a single hamburger. Then, it would take one hour to consume that food. One hamburger, therefore, has to be cut into 5 pieces in order to be consumed in one hour. Let's say that the hamburger is five times the amount of hamburger that would consume if the whole ten hamburger is consumed at once.\nEach hamburger equals one hamburger meal (one hamburger is equal to 5 hamburgers). This requires cutting into 5 hamburgers, therefore, 60 hamburgers is 60 hamburgers per person.\nThen let's say that the consumption of the whole 10 hamburger requires one hour. That means that 60 hamburgers per day equals a hamburger meal every day for the past two years. This means that there are 600 hamburgers per year. If every hamburger is destroyed, there is 600 hamburgers left. This can result in serious health problems. So, to help with this problem, it is recommended that the waste from two hamburgers be taken away from the hamburgers. And the hamburger is to be consumed more slowly. If there is no longer any wasted hamburgers left, then 60 hamburgers in 2 years equals 10 hamburgers per year = 60 hamburgers per year for the next two years. This is, therefore, enough hamburgers in a day to meet the needs of any person for two years.\nLet's assume that 10 hamburgers a day equals 20 hamburgers per day (100 hamburgers per year). Let's say that the value per hamburger of any person is one dollar. The number of hamburgers per person is 100 hamburgers per year, therefore, if hamburgers per person can no longer be counted, the dollar value per hamburger as per meal is $1. That is, the total number of hamburgers consumed per month is $10. The dollar value per hamburger for the month", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

The first unknown is the number of Schnauzers in a given city - this may or may not be the total number of Schnauzers:\n\nThe second unknown is the ratio of the city population to the total population of the city.\n\nIf a city has more than two Schnauzers, it also has more than one mosque.

The ratio of these two unknown is:\n\nAnd the ratio of these two answers is:\n\nSo the ratio of the total population to the total population in a given city is a constant:\n\nThis works out to be:\n\n(4)\nWhere the square root of the ratio of population of city to total population is 2.\nNow take the square root of the other unknown which is the population of a given city.

If it cannot be entered into the sheet, try to explain why in the following essay if possible.\n\nThe Doberman puppy is unique in the way that its behavior is a reflection of the owners. The dog has an inherent drive to please its owner to the level of distraction. This does not mean that we have to accept an endless source of attention but that we must take care to give the animal as much attention as it wants. When it is not feeling well in some way, it is easy to see the owners as a source of constant pressure. However, this is just a reflection of how the puppy was brought into this world and it is no excuse for bad behavior. One of the characteristics that we have developed is the need for discipline and obedience. Not only is the Doberman puppy an obedient dog but it is also a very intelligent one. This means that as he grows and has more experience, the puppy may begin to express feelings of wanting to do what he wants without a valid reason. It is possible that this can have an effect on the owners who do not know how to adjust their behavior appropriately. It is not appropriate to bring a dog to a party where the owner is not present. It is also important to realize that sometimes the Doberman puppy is able to make the owners give him attention due to its own need for attention. If you are the kind of dog owner with the habit of making your dog the center of attention at all times, this may be a cause of frustration for the dog. You must not accept criticism from the dog unless it is in a very calm way. There will always be an element of frustration in everything that exists in life. The", "answer": "B: answers"}

Just like all breed names, it will often differ from person to person, and with each different name, it may look different. For example, if the name is \"Cocker Spaniel\", it may differ from person to person. \"Shih Tzu\" or \"Shih Ta\", are all good pronunciations. However, some people pronounce \"English Setter\" as \"Setter\". It is good to know how to pronounce the breed name.\n\nThe breed is given by the number of dogs. For example, if you have a German Shepherd, and you choose the English Setter, then you must know how to pronounce the German Shepherd's name. For example, G-E-S-H-T-I-S, or \"Hats\", are both good names.\n\nIf the name of the breed was spelled out, but did not have the proper pronunciation, you may not be able to remember it.\n\nYou should also know what is a Schnauzer.

They have had springtime weather for almost every previous year they have lived in Pennsylvania.  They are not certain they are getting the summer they were hoping for.  They believe they should go to a doctor immediately.  The doctor feels they need to be checked for cancer as well as a few other conditions.

They wanted to do it with colored crayons. At the end of the week, they asked you \"Daddy, why do your crayons need colored crayons?\" At first, you said you didn't know, but when you asked them to explain what they meant by colored crayons the only thing the kid said was \"Crayon colours\". You asked again, and the child explained that the crayons were green, yellow, pink, orange, red, blue as well as in between. When he finally went to bed that night his tired brain came up with a simple yet profound idea: You only needed 3 crayons to make a colour wheel. You told him not to tell anyone, and to draw the picture using only those crayons. He sat and drew the picture slowly and carefully and you watched him and he drew much more. It was as if the picture had just been painted on his mind. As he finished he saw it and said \"Daddy you can still do this? Can I still paint this picture?\"\nWhen you talked to him later, he insisted that you needed only 3 crayons; you were all wrong. You needed 6 crayons to make the wheel of colour, but only 3 crayons to draw the picture. The crayon numbers are 4, 3, two, then one, in the sequence from right to left. When you asked him to go back and draw again using only those crayon numbers, he said that only needed 3 crayon numbers again, but only 3 craysons to paint the picture. When you questioned him again he told you that he had never counted. He said that you \"had\" only 3 crayons.\nWhen you confronted him he said that he couldn't remember counting. You told him his memory was faulty. He said \"You can't fool me!\" You said \"You see I knew all along, and all you did was pretend.\"\nYou said \"You just didn't want to admit it.\"\nA few days after you gave up on him, he was playing with his cousins and asked to paint his own wheels of colour. When you asked him why he needed to use the colour", "answer": "C: own home"}

Choices: A: go to the library B: find out people with whom you already have ties C: find out people you want people to ask D: find out people who are being proposed to E: ask people around you\nOutput: A Tying in with the question from the beginning, I would give most to going to the library, but if I were to ask people I knew this information would be helpful, because they probably know others who I would ask before going library, because we see people around them all the time.\nI would recommend finding someone you know or have a strong relationship with before going to the library.\n\nIn this passage, we are considering people who know other people. For them, there must be a certain level of familiarity with their potential future partners. A person who knows someone else has a better chance of being able to recommend someone to be engaged than one who is only known by a few people. The more people who know someone well, the greater chance they are of having recommendations for their future spouse. I think finding out who to ask would be a step in that direction. You can look through people you know well when it comes to their wedding planning, to find out about the same sort of people who might be good for getting engaged.\nIn this passage, I would want to know about relationships you have with people you already know! If you knew somebody very well, you already had the information needed, so you didn't have a lot of trouble getting out of the relationship.\n\nWhat is the most common question people ask in marriage negotiations?

They know what they want, they have a relationship with a family member, or at least know somebody who knows someone who is getting married.

{"text": "A: happiness D: relaxation E: create music F: sadness\nWhat would happen if you are not good? When you are not good you are not happy, but when you are not good, happiness comes as your answer.\nLet me give you an example; my friend is very good or at the very least very good at guitar, and when he isn't playing he is so happy to be playing the guitar. When he's not playing he is sad and sometimes angry. This makes him very sad and very angry. I'm sure you see where I'm going with this right? This makes him really sad and angry and depressed. He starts playing the guitar to distract himself but the guitar is not like the violin. It is not a relaxing instrument, but rather it is a depressing one. It is the same sadness that he had been feeling the last few days. It is the same kind of sadness that he suffered from when he didn't play the guitar. This is the same kind of feelings that he had been having this whole time.\nWhen he is not playing the guitar, he is sad and angry and does not feel well. All that he wants is for the guitar to help to make him feel better because he feels so bad all the time. It is almost like he is trying to escape something that doesn't exist: he is just pretending that he has forgotten or forgotten what happened. He knows that whatever he is trying to forget is still in that person's memory, but he just doesn't seem to really want to let go of it even if he knew that he should. It wouldn't ever be better than the situation that he lives in, so he just doesn't even let himself think about it. He starts doing things that he doesn't like to do in order to let himself cope with the feelings that is not pleasant to think about, but he is never truly happy. He starts having a lot of troubles and he keeps thinking that if he just plays more guitar things will be better. It causes more problems for him since he can't concentrate in class anymore since he is busy thinking about those feelings. He has been a lot closer to the verge of suicide because he has wanted to be like the guitar, but he didn't want to take the steps to get there because he wasn't sure that it was what he wanted to do. The feeling of happiness was a temporary relief, but the feelings of sadness were more permanent until one day he was playing guitar again only to realize that no matter how much he tried", "answer": "D: sadness"}

The perimeter is always equal to the hypotenuse as measured by the center line.\n\nOutput:What is the distance between two of the points that lie on the plane of the hexagonal plane?\n\nInput:There are three possibilities:\nA) The number of points you see on the pentagon is equal to:\n-3 (if the number of points is 8)\n-10 (if the number of the points is 9 to 15)\n-20 (if the number of 8's on the left is the number you see most often on the right)\nB) The number of points has no decimal place. (Note that the number of points is always expressed as a number in hexadecimal, i.e. 6-6-2-2-6-6-10-8-12-6-9-6-7-2. The same is true if you write the number in base 10, for example, 5-x-x-x-y-x-y-y-y. The number 2 in hexadecimal is equal to 2.)\nC) The number of points is less than 2.\nD) The number of points equals to 2.\n\nOutput: How many points are above the pentagon?\nThe number of points is = 0\nThe number of points under the pentagon is = 2\nThe number of points between the pentagon and the other circle is = 2\n\nInstructions:\n1. Find all of the points that lie between the two circles (in other words, between the pentagon", "answer": "D: make payments"}

B: Each animal type has different characteristics(c)\nWhich animal type is closest to the dog breed of the man?  A:The dog breed of the man.  (I'm a bit of a dog hound here and I couldn't find a good enough answer for why you wouldn't want to buy a dog breed that was genetically similar to its closest living relative) E:The dog breed of this man\n(A was the correct answer.)  This is because A is the closer of the dog species to the man species, meaning that it has some of that living relative's characteristics while not being genetically similar.  As for why you wouldn't buy a dog breed that looks like its closest living relative, it's because that's a dog-breeding-related issue and not a genetic one.\nInput:\n\"You have given a wrong answer.\"\nThe dog is a dog-breeding-relating.  So the correct answer is dog B\nThe man is a man of breed.   Thus he has something to breed.  (I have to agree on this one.

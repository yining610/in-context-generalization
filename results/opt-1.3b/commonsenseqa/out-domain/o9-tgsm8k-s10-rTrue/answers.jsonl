Therefore, the maximum direction a man's movement can go is 10.\nThus, the most possible angles a man's movement can take is 10 which is twice as many directions as there can be angles in a human body.\nThus, the total angles a man's movement could take is 10, which is twice as many as there can be angles.\nThe maximum angles a man's movement (and any other human body) could take is 10 which is three times as many as there can ever be angles.\nThus, the max angle a man's movement (or any other human body) can take is 30.\nThus, the angles a man's movement as a whole can take are 30, which is 6 times as many as there is to be either ways.\nThus, the angle of a man's movement in a manly body is 6.\nThus, the number of angles a man's body can take is 6.\nThus the", "answer": "E: airplane"}

Their goal is to have the system record how many hours they work each day and then play a guessing game to see who will lose the bet.  A computer program will be running to record each day's hours.  The first person to guess correct (within 5 minutes) will win $1000.  The second will win $100.  The third will win $100.\nThe first person's time clock begins.  He goes on strike and does not start recording the time his work has been done.  On the next day when the program is turned on, the program will not show his hours.  For every other day this program is turned on, only the last 4 hours will show his hours.  Eventually the program will record only 8 hours of his work.\nWhen the first person is finished doing this, he begins recording his time clock.  The program will record each hour in turn.  From this, a number will be recorded each day and played back to see who guesses correctly, winning $1000. The 2nd person comes along, records the hours of the first person, and guesses correctly.  The 3rd person guesses incorrectly.\nSo the first two players each know their exact numbers of hours. The 3rd person does not.

There weren't any firemen to put out the fire, so he set the gas station on fire using the accelerant which was in a bottle he had on him. In his dream Stanley also saw 4 black males in black hooded sweatshirts in front of him at the gas station. In his dream, he also saw himself having fire-pumps fitted in each of his wrists. In reality, he was in a fire training at the fire department.\nWhile dreaming Stanley saw himself going through training to be a firefighter, and in his dream he wore fire-pumps. In reality, however, his friend John was wearing fire-pumps.\nWhile dreaming, Stanley saw two masked attackers come at him and try to get him to commit the arson and murder of his coworkers. It was at this point that he realized one of the killers was not him. Stanley went to the bathroom at the station, where he was watching his dream through a video camera. While looking at the tape he realized he was the one being chased, and that the killer was actually the one that was trying to get him to commit murder. The reason why Stanley woke up was not his memory of the dream, but because his body was beginning to shake violently. As a result, he went to a hospital thinking that he had a stroke or a heart attack. In reality, however he was a little bit confused about what had happened, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. Stanley was eventually diagnosed with a severe bout of amnesia. In the last few seconds of his life Stanley was watching over his old girlfriend, who was now sitting in a wheelchair.\nAt this point in time, Stanley had no memory of what had happened. However, he was able to see the video tape of what he had dreamt while in the bathroom. He watched how he burned down the gas station and the killers from his perspective in the tape. At that moment, though he was still in the nightmare, he realized that his girlfriend was actually the one that he was being chased by, not the one that he was trying to kill. Realizing this, Stanley woke up and drove to his girlfriend's house in order to tell her what had happened. Unfortunately, she had another woman with her in the home.\nBecause of his severe amnesia Stanley was unable to tell whether the other woman was pregnant. So", "answer": "A: reality"}

{"text": "Anger\n\nInput:An average of 17.6 people are killed per week by gunfire in cities around the world. How many gunshot victims are there in New York? Answering: Answering: An average of 18.46 shot victims are killed per week by gunshots in New York City. The average total number of shot victims per year in New York City is 8.45 million in the year 2000. Assuming there were 5 million Americans living in New York in 2006, that means that the New York City population has nearly doubled to 12 million people since the year 2000. So the number of shot victims per week per year by gunfire is 16.3 million in the year 2000 and it rose to 17.06 million people in the year 2006. Assuming that this figure was correct 20% of all the gunshot victims were children under the age of seventeen. What is the number of shot victims in the city in 2006?\nOutput: An average annual number of shot victims in New York City is 2.4 million in the year 2000, an average number of 2.4 million in 2006, an average annual number of 2.8 million in two years time. Thus, the total number of shot victims between 2000 and 2006 is 8.45 million.\nSince New York City's population has almost double over the year 2000, the number of shot victims between that year and 2006 rose from about 7 million to about 8.45 million. And if this figure was correct, the total number of shots in the year 2000 and the year 2006 is equal.

That penalty is called the \"click penalty\" rate.\nIn other words, the higher your click rate, the lower you will have the \"click penalty\" that day.\nSo if you set your click rate to 20 clicks per second, that penalty rate on that day will be 0.2 and if you set it to 100 clicks per second, that rate becomes 0.45.\nSo this table suggests that to make 10 clicks per day, you should try your best to set your click rate at 10 clicks per second to avoid the click penalty.\nBut if you make 50 clicks per day, your click rate should be set at 50 clicks per se.\nOtherwise, there will be a click penalty on that day.\n\nInput: Two rabbits got into the house.

If John ate a steak costs $2.00 per slice, with a cheese sandwich costing $1.00. The total cost of everything from Oatmeal to Hamburger to Cheese Sandwich is $24.00.\nJohn eats 24*48=720 calories a day.

As all the men who are interested will only take part in one night the first night, she will get 8 boys, 7 girls, and a woman.\nThe total number of boys in the show is 12, the total number of girls is 12, the total amount of male participants is 8. So the final number of men is 7*12=30, the total number of female participants is 12, the total male participants are 8.\nSince the final number of male participants is 8, their total number is 32*12=960 for a total of 2*32 = <<32*12=16>>16 men.\nSince the final total number of female participants in the show is 16, the final total number of females is 16*32 = <<16*32=33>>33 females.\n\nInput:The average rate at which the number of hours worked increases over time is 0.80 hours per day per person.

The woman receives 75% of the profit for $.75 and the grocer receives 25% of the profit for the other 25%. How much does the farmer earn in commissions for each sale?\nOutput: The grocer gets $.25 for each full ounce of produce and the farmer gets $.75 for each half ounce of produce.\nThus, the grocer gets $.30 for each full ounce of fruits and veggies and the farmer gets $1 for each half ounce.\nThus they each earn $1.25 * $.50 = $.75 per full ounce of fruits and vegetables each time they are fed.\nSo the final amount of each transaction is $.75 * $.75 = $.90\nNow suppose the woman sells 2/3 of an ounce of fruits and veggies each day. So her gross profit for selling the produce for $1.25 is $4.50.\nThus each day she earns $4.50. Each time she works, she saves $3.75 * 50 = $6.25 in interest earned.\nThus each day for only $5.00 the woman earns $6.25 in commissions.\nThus she earns $0.75 per full ounce in commissions for selling produce for $1.75 per day for the produce.\n\nInput: What the following sentence means?  \"He left at two.\"  \"The customer came in after he left.\"  \"Three hours later, he arrived at his job.\"\nOutput:  \"Three hours later\" means that he left at two hours ago.\n\"He left at two. \"The customer came in at precisely two. \"The customer left after", "answer": "B: wave goodbye"}

After several days, your kitten will start to get used to the food and eventually not touch his or her food. When he does, he will begin to eat a little bit of your canned food rather than dry cat food, but only a few cubes at a time. Then that little bit is added slowly to the large bowl of dry food, and so on. Your kitten will no longer eat your dry food. Eventually he will chew it up. Do not put more cat food in. If he chews on a few cubes of dry cat food, he will eventually break one of the food cubes and be forced to drink his whole contents. If he does that, he will be forced to drink water, which is made from the water of the bowl. If the dish is clean, he will not drink it, but he will try to drink the water outside of the bowl, so it is clean. If you leave him outside, you will be able to hold a glass in front of his nose in order to keep him from drinking it. When your kitten tries to drink water, he will get spooked, so hold the glass up so he sees it. The cat will start to drink, knowing that his food has been eliminated.\n\nInput: The average distance between two places is 4 miles... How many miles is that? Answers:", "answer": "B: feel angry"}

Output: One can get a certificate on any subject.\nInput: Which is more important in getting a job? Output: Getting a certificate is more difficult at an entry level or after several years. One can get a certificate in many jobs.\nInput: People want certificates because they believe they have reached their potential/desired job. For example, someone that was very skilled at cooking for 5 people can't get a full-time cooking job if it's only $7/hour because that person believes he hasn't reached his true potential/desired job and he would be better off focusing on something else. Hence, he will always get certified in a specialized job. Hence the majority might feel they could go beyond that job if they trained themselves more in the specialized. Hence the certifying agency might be willing to train people on a specific specialized knowledge if they paid for it themselves. Hence certified employees can get their degrees at a much lower price than a new employee with no experience. Hence the certification agency might benefit less than an individual. Hence certification agencies usually end up going out of business. Hence certification agencies are not very good. Hence certification agencies can help people, but only to the degree of what someone pays for it. Hence the certification agencies are not very competitive. Hence the certification agencies rarely have competition and they only help the very wealthy. Hence, the certification agencies have a bad reputation.

The ostrich is unable to fly without these feathers, how did the ostrich manage to get them so that it could fly?  The ostrich's body takes up most of the space on the ground, so the feathers have to be as small as possible to protect the body.  How did the ostrich get the feathers so small?  The ostrich used a sharp edge to bend a stick into the shape of a small feather.  It then used a sharp edge to cut another stick into the shape of yet another tiny feather.  This is repeated numerous times until a large feather is formed.  The ostrich then used a sharp edge and twisted the feathers into a small wing.  The feathers began to feather as the ostrich flew.  The feathers in the wings of the ostrich allowed the bird to glide efficiently, which eventually made the ostrich fly across the sky.  The ostrich can fly even further if it uses its new wing a little differently.  The ostrich's feathers can be bent with great force until they expand in size and the wing becomes very aerodynamic.  The ostrich must have learned a lot about feather size from its use of a stick to make and turn wings.\n\nInput:An eight-ounce can of Coke contains 11 percent alcohol.

The number of spots is divided into two equal parts:  1 person gets 0 spots, the other person gets 1 spot per hand.  Each hand consists of 8 cards, each player must take 9 cards from this pile and place them on the board.  Each person gets to take up to 10 cards per hand.  After all the cards are placed, then players draw cards from the next pile on the left, and so on.  At the start of each round, the last card drawn is the person who started the first round.  Since the hand ends with either 10 or 9 players leaving, the first player wins and gets to draw another card.  The winning player gets to take the second card from the first hand.  After the game, one player will be in the loser's position, and the loser will get to draw 10 cards.  Each player then gets to take 4 cards from the discarded hands.  This game consists of 10 rounds in each half hour, one half hour per person.  At the end of the game, a winner and loser are awarded points.  The winner gets to keep the points he scored, and the loser does not get any points.  This does not change from one game to the next.\nInput: 10 x 1 hour = 0.5 * 0.75 = 0.5 times 2.  0.5 x 2 = 1, 1.25 * 1.25 = 1.5 times 3.5 = 2.5 times 3 + 1.5 = 3.5 times 8\nOutput: Since there are 8 players in each game, there are 8*1, 1.5 * 1.5 = 8, 1.25 * 3.5 = 8, and 1.25 * 3 + 1 = 8 + 1.825 * 3 = 9\nSo the final answer for this is 9\n\nInput:   1.

{"text": "a: air b: water c: space, shuttles, earth, tunnel\nThe solution is: C\nIf you had to make a list of the parts of a car, the part on the left is the engine, the part on the right is the axle. If you use 1 of the parts as a starting point, you would create a car. For example, your car would be a V10 engine. You would also calculate the number of cylinders of the engine, the number of pistons, and the mass(ratio of rotors to cylinders). Your car would also have the front wheel, the rear axle, and the front gear(shaft) as input. Also as a start point for your car calculation, I would suggest looking at what the car looks like with it's engine's pistons on it. The parts on the left are to calculate the amount of gas in the car. On the right are how many cylinders, pistons, and mass(ratio of rings to the pistons). You would also figure out the number of revolutions, which is how many times this engine has to run each day for it to equal the amount of gas in it. So the ratio of piston to piston would be the ratio of car to car. Also with the number of pistons you have to start from you could then find which gear(s) on the front gearbox(shaft) to put on it. You could then calculate the number of gears on the front gearbox in the same way you have already calculated the number of wheels.\nSo once you start seeing the shape of the pieces on the right and you have some idea about the shape of the pieces in the left, you would have a decent starting point when you start calculating the amount of oxygen in a car. And now, all you have to do is calculate how much gas you will need, how to calculate the size of a cylinder, add the amount of gas to the number of pistons to the number of cylinders(ratio of pistons to pistons), and calculate the amount of air in the car with that.\nOnce you get all that done, you can then figure out the parts that go on different cars and place them in another car. The parts in another car have the same shape as a V8 which is the shape you started with.\nIf I wanted to know how the air and oxygen in the moon is flowing through it, I would also start with what a part of the moon looks like", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

A typical car has about 8,000 miles on the odometer. If he buys another car with 300,000 miles on the clock, then he will have paid $2,750 x 3*8=$11,800 for the car. What would be the cost to him of buying a $2,000 car?\nInput:He would have to pay $11,800*3*8=$11.2*$22,900 for a $2,000 vehicle. That is all his $2,000 car budget would cover. How much of that $11,800 would become debt?\nOutput:Total cost of vehicle financing, interest and maintenance, as they apply, is $10,700 dollars, or $<10,700=30>30% of his $2,000 budget.\nSo, he would have to come up with $2,000 + 10/30 = $3,500 to purchase another $2,000 car\n\nInput:How much electricity does a light bulb use?\nOutput:How much electricity did a light bulb consume?\nInput:According to the National Energy Policy Act of 1990, the average household will use a bulb with an efficiency of 55.7% in the year 2000. If we assume that the average household uses 1 light bulb each year, then the total electricity consumption would be 2.2 billion kWhs. That would be enough to power 13.4 million homes for a year. Why do we need so much electricity to power a light bulb?\nOutput:This power is the energy produced by the burning of oil and natural gas. Natural gas is the form of energy in which crude oil is dissolved. As crude oil is burned, some of the energy from the fuel is captured. Therefore, only 100% of the energy would be wasted if we didn't burn the oil we already have; that is wasted energy. Because we use so much oil and natural gas and because we need oil for many other uses, we need to use more oil and natural gas than we burn. So it would be sensible to burn more oil and natural gas.", "answer": "A: slender"}

The other two cars are loaded on to two trucks. How much weight can two trucks carry? Output:  The two trucks can carry 2 tons each = the final answer is 15.4 = 31.4 tons.\nSo two trucks for the two cars that the two cars are on can carry a combined 31.4 tons of weight.\nThat is why the truck can carry so much weight: it can carry more than 25 tons each.\nSo the final score is 31.4 - 25 = 20.6\n\nInput:  What is the average amount an airline will charge a passenger for a round trip?

She expects to spend at least $1200 on recruiting new volunteers.  What is the net worth of the organization?\nOutput: The new organization will have a net worth of $1200.  This will mean $1500/1200 = $<<1500$20=$<<20$10>>$10,000\nFor the first 10 days the organization is generating $3500 in revenue at its best.  The member expects to spend at least the same amount on advertising.  If she can get 50 volunteers she will be able to make $4500 in the first month, and $750 per month after that.

The man told his wife about his good fortune. Later that day, the woman received a call from her husband. He told her that his employer was asking him to give a bonus to the employees of a very large company as a thank you for having him on the payroll.

The total travel time from the car to the train is 270/60 = <<270/60=240>>240 minutes. Therefore you need to change the oil 20% more than necessary.\nIf you are going by public transportation, every 10-15 hours you will need to change the oil. In terms of travel times, it takes 10*20*20 = $30*20*20 = >>30*20*20=135 minutes to get to work by train. The total travel time is 135/60 = <<135/60=105>>105 minutes. Therefore you need change the oil every 90 minutes more than necessary.\nSo the final output is $30*60*60 = $120/60*60 = $140\nBecause there is more time difference between car to train and train to car than between train to train and train to train, the total travel time is 120/60 * 60 = >>120/60*60=135 minutes\nHowever, if you only change the oil 20% as much as necessary,", "answer": "E: engage"}

She has not been playing for very long. There is a goal about 10 meters away and a penalty kick in about 15 meters. What do you think she should do if she is not able to score a goal? The penalty kick is much easier to score than the goal. So she should pass the ball to her goal and score by shooting. What is her total possible score?\nOutput: If you are a boy playing soccer on a red field, you can score one goal. If you are a girl playing soccer on a green pitch, you can score one score. That means that for every 3 goals scored by a boy, there is a probability of one goal scoring by a girl. That means that for each 2 goals scored by a boy with a ball, there is a 1/3 probability of another goal scoring by a girl with a ball. That means that if you score a goal on the first try with a ball, you should expect to score another goal on the next try with a ball. That also means that if you miss 2 attempts, your score is halved. That means that if the girl misses a couple of attempts and then makes a good attempt", "answer": "B: melting"}

What is your average daily calorie consumption?\nOutput: The average daily calorie consumed by a person is 10*10^250^250 = >310,000 calories. Since an average body mass of 150 pounds equates to 0.313 kg, his 10,720 calories represents a weekly intake of 0.311 kg.\nThat means he ate 310*10^250= 310 kg * (0.3kg/week). He ate 0.311 kg for a year.\nHe burned 559 kg during that year.\nSince a kg is about 1,040 calories, a kg/week has burned a kilogram, for a year, for a total of 5.3 kg\nThat shows he consumed 12.4 kg of food per week for a year\nSo he consumed 9,731 calories at a rate of 10/10 = 10 calories per second for a total of 9,731 calories\nTotal caloric intake for a year: 310,000 = 1090 calories per year.\nTotal caloric intake since 2000: 9,731 = 109000 calories.\nSo the final total caloric intake for a year is 109000/0.310 = 109,000 calories\n\nInput: A young couple decides to get married after both meeting a life insurance salesman and thinking it's a good match.

{"text": "All you need is desire + money + time + some sort of goal.\nSo, for example, for the people purchasing the car that Jack wants, the desire is going to be $75,000 and the goal is to get the car. Hence, the desires will be $75,000, but spending money has added $250 so it will be $80,000. But since the car is a big part of this goal, so will the goals. Hence, it will be $80k - $250 = $75k. Thus, $75k has added $2k to your goal of having $10k. Hence you've moved from your initial $50k to $60k. You now have $10k to spend that you would probably never have before. The additional $2k will go toward saving the house and buying a second car, either a sedan or a convertible. The extra $2k will not be needed. You may be wondering why it would be necessary for me to say, \"desire + money + goal.\" I'm going to say that this is because of my assumption. After all, what good is money if you do not have passion and an interest in what you are achieving? As an analogy, the car, and the house, are a goal. If you are not passionate about their purchase, which I would argue is most people with money, then it will be the money that motivates you. This is also the reason that, for Jack, the goal is only $75,000. If he wanted to buy a $500,000 car, he would have. Hence, he would have to put the $2k required to get to $75,000 at the house. I've eliminated most if not all of the spending that is required to get there, hence the additional $750 needed for saving the house and purchasing the car, saving for the car, and then saving the $750 needed to go to $80,000. Hence now has a goal of saving for a house and the additional $2k goes toward that.

When his savings account balance is low, he goes to his bank and borrows $100 from another banker.  The amount of money the bank borrows must be exactly $100 less than the amount of money Jack earns in a day, so that day his savings account balance is negative.  To bring his savings account balance close to what it had been before he borrowed, Jack gives $100 to his bank banker.  This makes his savings account balance equal to $100.  Now he only has to pay off the loan $100 a day. What was Jack\u2019s day like, which is what gave him a way to get his savings account balance close again?\nOutput: Jack earned a total of $100 + $100 = >1000$ (because $100 was borrowed from somebody else as a loan)\nJack earned this amount of money on 10/15.

Because he got a $100 loan and he had $100 to spend, his savings account balance was >10.

Thus, his savings account balance rose 20% just from the 2 days he spent.\nFor day 3, Jack earned $1000 (because he spent $1,500).

Which pair of shoes will he buy, a brown shoe or red shoes. What are the red shoes made of. Output: First, find out which size shoes John wears, a size 7 for the shoe. Then find out the width of the shoe, 13 centimetre, and the width of the shoe's heel, 3 centimetre.\nThus: the wide shoe's heel is 3 centimetre wide. The narrow shoe's heel is 6 centimetre wide. So John's shoe is a 13.5 centimetre shoe. Now multiply the width of his shoe by 2, which is 9/16\". That is a 3/16\" shoe heel. John's shoe is 9/16\" shoe\nSo John's shoe is a 9/16\" shoe.

Output: Find 10 friends to chip in $1 each time.\nTherefore: the $1 per chip money can each buy a new home.\nThis means John can either make $1 from each chip, or he can make $1.5 from everyone.\nSo far the chip $ is making him $1, but the people $ is making him $2.25.\nSo total: the two $ are making each $2.25. That means the $2.25 is taking $2 of the $2.25, so the total profit by the $2 to the $1 is 1.25.\nSo the total loss to the $2 is 3/2 = 1.25, and that result is the $2.25. So the $2 losses are the $1.25 profits, the $1.25 losses are the $1 the $2 has taken out of the $2.5.\nSo the final profit is $1*2.25 = $1.25.\n\nInput: The boy in the", "answer": "D: rest area"}

He usually rests his right hand on his guitar for the last two or three minutes of each of the eight songs he plays. So on average he plays a guitar for nine hours a day. On average he is able to play four hours a day without sleep. Now on average he works 40 hours a week, and he plays 30 hours a week.

This question relates to the game aces versus fours in one-deck, three-handed or five-handed versions. Each player can choose to bid for the next person to take four, or he can ask for any of the possible cards that he would like to get, including an additional one. If his bid for the next player takes all of the possible cards, he wins the round. If his bid doesn't take all of the possible cards he has, he loses the round. If players choose to bid simultaneously for a player who has a four, they get their fourth card for free. If a player loses the bidding for an opponent, he loses the round and will not get a fourth free card.\nIn each round, players will bid only once to see which player will get the next card. In this round, if no bid comes from one player, the next player will receive the card. If no bid comes from the second player, the first player will get the card. As bidding begins, players will bid at random for each other player, with random order continuing until all three players have bids. After the last player has bid, the next player starts bidding and all players must bid at this point.\n\nInput:There are 17 students in a group.

{"text": "The applicant should be given equal opportunity, compliments, and raffle tickets.\n\nWhat is the purpose of an average?\n\nSuppose the question is \u201cHow many times can a person get a credit card with a credit limit equal to their credit limit\u201d? The answer to this question will tell you a lot about the person. The more credit limit he has, the longer he has to use that credit card before he spends it all. Hence, his credit limit or credit utilization factor is the ratio between the amount he has on his credit card and the amount of money he has actually spent since he started using the card.\n\nCredit utilization of 40% = 100% + 80% = 200% + 80%. The ratio will be 0.4. That means once you use your credit card, you will need to pay 200% of what you spend.\n\nThis example shows two cases:\n1. Suppose Mark has $800 in credit card debt and uses his credit card for $300 worth of expenses. His credit card utilization factor is 100%.\n2. Suppose Mark has $150 in credit card debt. He uses his credit card for a $100 expense. His credit card utilization for the whole month of Jan-April is 100%.\nIn both the cases, Mark spends $600, which equates to the $800. If his credit card utilization factor were 1, he would not have a problem paying that whole credit card debt off in 3 months. Hence, his utilization factor is 1.\nHowever, if Mark\u2019s credit card utilization factor is 2, he would already be in debt.\nAnd if his credit card utilization factor is 3, then he would already be bankrupt.\n\nTo calculate an average, the most significant number is the number of people, and most important are the most days of the week for the number.\n\nInput: A man buys a new truck, a Chevy Suburban.

How many years will he use the truck and how many years will he use his Suburban?\nOutput: Using truck and sub together, his annual total is 3 + *$1000 = $<<3+$1000=150>>150 years. That means he will spend $150 * $1000 * 3+ * * 1000 = $<<3+*1000=1500", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

Suppose one is a heavy drinker, and the other a moderate drinker. What beers would they purchase if they were going to drink the total number of beers that would constitute an average day at the brewery? Answer: A: 7.75 L B: 14 L C: 35 L D: 49 L\nEach person drinks 7.75/14 = <<7.75/14=35>>35.5 drinks per day\nEach person is drinking 35 drinks a day.\nThus, the total amount of drinking by the heavy drinkers is 35 + 49 = 64.\nSo in total they consumed 64*7.5 * 7*7.75 = 768 drinks a day, a total consumption of 960 in the week.\nTherefore, their days off between drinking are equal to their drinking days plus 768*56 = 720.\nIf one drinks every day of the week, every day minus 364 equals 364 days, and each day minus 366 equals 36 days. If one drinks every other day of the week, no day minus 364 equals 364, and each day minus 365 equals 365 days. Therefore, one drink per day per week for the heavy drinkers equals 32 drinks. Thus, their days off in one week equals 32* 32 + 72 = 96 drinks.\nThus, their drinking days are 32 * 24 minus 96 = 1648 drinks.\nThus they had 16*36 days to drink in one week.\nThus, the days off were 1648 + 16*32 + 48 = 2104.\nSince those days were a total of 2104, their drinking days in one week equaled 2104 ** 2 = 2247.\nThus, their days off in two weeks equal 2247 + 2247 + 1127 = 3244 days. Therefore, their drinking days in three weeks equals 2247 + 3244 + 720 = 4368.\nSo the total drinking by the heavy drinkers equals 4368/1648 = <<4368/1648=4>>4368 days after the drinking binge.\nThus, the heavy drinkers completed a drinking binge in 4368 days.\nSo the total spent in drinking is 4368/1648*4 = 992 days, or more than four times as many days as the drinking binge.

How much gasoline would a typical motorist buy?\nOutput: The average cost of traveling 2000 miles by car in 2006 was $3.40, in 2008 it was $4.74 but in 2007 it was $3.25.\nSo a typical motorist purchased $3.40 worth of gasoline in 2006, but the total price was $10.24.\nThat means the total cost of driving 2000 miles by car in 2007 was $11.78.\nThat means the average motorist purchased $3 more in gasoline in 2007 than in 2006.\nSo the total price of driving 2000 miles by motor in 2007 was $27.27.\nSo the total cost of driving 2,000 miles by car in 2007 would be $29.27 had the price of gasoline been $2.98 in 2006. To put this into perspective, a gallon of gasoline in 2006 cost $1.89 in 2008.\nAlso, the national average price of gasoline for the entire 2008 was $2.88, which is the highest the price has been since 1997.

If he takes the banana to work he will only take it out of the vending machine once a month. After working out for 30 minutes, he will take it out of the locker room. After a week of doing this he will take it out 4 times from the vending machine. After 3-4 weeks he will take it out twice from each of the vending machines. After the 6-12 weeks he will take it 3-4 times a day from the vending machines. If he takes it out at lunch every day he will take it for lunch from the vending machines. After 3 years of the exact same thing the banana will have expired due to internal decay and decay damage. Assuming he does this for 3 years, the banana will have been eaten by 35-40-50 people. Assuming a banana is eaten once every 70-90 days it will have been eaten a total of 700 times- that\u2019s 20 times if you were to eat a banana every day for 20 years, which is unlikely.

How much money would it take for Mary to feed her husband and have enough money for the utilities?\nOutput: Mary needs $45 to feed her husband and the utilities.\nThis means her A is $45 + $45 =<<45+45=<<45+45>>45 dollars.\nMary will need $45 more than that to put food in her freezer, if necessary.\nSo Mary can purchase $45 + $45+$10 = $<<45+45+.$10= >>45 dollars.\nWhich is the lower of >>45 dollars or $<<45= <<45 dollars?>>\nSo she cannot purchase $45 if she wishes to spend $45 on food items. Instead she needs $45+45+$10 = <<45+45+.10=>>45 dollars.\nThis means all of her A is 40 dollars and her B is $45. Therefore Mary needs $40. This would mean a total of $45 + $15 = $<<45 + 15=<<45-$15>><45.10>>45 dollars.\nSo she cannot purchase any food.\nMary chooses to spend the $45. She will not purchase any food. Therefore all of her A is 60 dollars. She could spend the $15 and eat two meals and have enough food to put one meal in the freezer.\nSo Mary needs the total of $60 + $15 = $$<<45 + 15=$50>>50 dollars.\nThis would mean a total of 60+15 = $60 +$40 = $<<45.10>><45.10>>>\nTherefore all her B is 30 dollars and her C is 30 dollars. Therefore Mary needs $35. This would mean she would need $30 to pay the utilities and $35 to feed herself and take care of the children.\nTherefore her B is $30 + $35 = <<30+35=<<30+35>><30+. 10>>>\nTherefore her B is 60 dollars and her C is $35.

The orchard only has 1 set of workers and 1 pair of pickers. The pickers bring in the apples into the orchard, and then the apples have to be weighed to determine if they weigh less than or more than 90 pounds. The apples are then distributed among the workers in order for them to sort apples according to the weight that they weigh. As the apples are picked, they are then weighed again to maintain order.  Bob and Alice are two different workers because they are both female and have different tastes in apples. Alice likes red apples and Bob likes red, green, and yellow apples. How many apples get sorted by the pickers per day?\nOutput: The apples get sorted per time that each work at the orchard. Hence, there are 4 apple picking times per day: 3AM to 9AM, 8AM to 12PM, 4PM to 8PM, and 12PM to 3AM.\nIf there were 10 apples picked in each of the 3AM-9AM times, then total apples sorted by the workers will be (3^10)/2 = $7\nIf there were only 1 apple picked during each time that each worker was in the orchard, then total apples selected by said worker should be: $7 * 10 = $112\nThus each of said worker's apples should get sorted separately when they go to work each day.\n\nInput: There was a time when the price of iron in Finland was the lowest in the world.

That means the typical American has an additional $60 per month in disposable income. That includes buying groceries and other items at the grocery store, restaurants, movie theatres, etc. But $60 does not include $15 per month for gasoline. That means the average American has an even smaller discretionary budget of $50 per month. It is important to note that $50 includes both the $15 per month gasoline and $30 per month for other items of the disposable income. The total disposable income for an average American is $550 for rent, transportation, etc.. So the average American spends $550 per month.", "answer": "A: television"}

Over that time he worked almost 8 hours a day. Suppose his wife has asked him for some help. Assuming he will not refuse a helping hand for fear of hurting his wife, Henry will work 6 hours a day and wash all the laundry in his house. Let's say the next night after Henry's wife has left for work, he comes home to a clean house. What would this mean?\nOutput: It means Henry worked for 7 hours and finished up for the night\nSo let's say Henry finished his laundry at 7 p.m. On a typical night, he would only have worked for 6 hours and been expected to do about 4 more over dinner and/or after his wife got home. We will assume that Henry slept in 2 more hours to make up for that extra work. After a full 11 hours in the day, Henry only worked about 2 hours of actual work. So let's say Henry worked for 7 in a row straight in order to get it all done. We will also assume that his wife left at 7 p.m., so Henry actually drove home for 2 straight hours.\nWhen Henry goes to work the next day, his wife will leave at 7:15 a.m. While Henry drives home, he will drive about an hour or two to a town that is 3 hours away. With a drive that long, Henry will do about 4 or 5 hours of work before he returns to the house for supper.

{"text": "A (connections)\nB (airport)\nC (wall)\nD (computer network)\nE (love)\n\nInput:Two days before a football match, a team of five referees is divided into two teams. One team of five men (two refs) will be at the centre field and the other team of five men (one ref) will be on the goal line, each in the middle of the field. The referee will call the first few points of the game. He will use the goal line for the extra point. Once the ball is scored on, one side of the goal line has to go to the goal post to make sure that the ball remains in play. One of the refs will be at the centre of the field, near the goal goal line, with the other being on the goal line, near the halfway point. That second ref will signal if any team tries to kick a goal, and will take the ball and put it on the goal line. Then the teams will advance one minute at a time. If a team makes more than three successful kicks on the goal line and one of those kicks is inside the goal line, the team that made this kick starts the next minute. If a team makes two or three of those successful kicks on the goalline, that team advances one minute at a time and the two teams advance one minute at a\ntime. If two or three of those kick are inside the goal, if the kicker makes more than three points in any one inning, the player running forward gets possession of the ball and starts the next inning. The refs will be located on the goal line only for this game. After the first game ends, all the refs have to get to the airport. Where will they go from there?\nOutput: Each referee has to get across the whole football field in 10 hours. At the distance of 5.8 kilometres (3.9 miles) on foot, it will take six hours to make that journey.

To get a guard on duty at a moment's notice, each theatre has to post a guard for only $400 each, a total cost of $1,400. The guards at A and C never work more than three showings per week (the length of a work day at the time of the show); they perform additional work during the week as needed. D is a school zone; the guard must only be present for playtime. E is a military base; the guard can be present at the theatre for up to 30% of the playtime. As a result, troops rarely show up at or go near the theatre and only perform if requested to. Military bases also require a high standard of performance during training drills.\nMall: In a mall there are two entrance doors (one for shoppers, one for employees), and one exit door. These doors each cost $150 each and will fit in the trunk (no larger) of your car. Employees pay $100 for their own entrance, and employees pay the other $100 each in the form of weekly tickets. This totals $2,500 which will pay for 3 meals per week.\nHospital: In a hospital there are eight entrances. At a given moment, three or four doors will be closed and no one will be entering the hospital. Employees pay $200 each for their own entrance, but can have people work on their emergency room for free.\nMilitary Base: A military base is composed of three air-defenses.

While he's making the soup, he will start a fire with 3 kinds of wood. Mary gets her soup and has it served to her by a waiter in a small restaurant nearby. After William is finished filling the tank of gas, he turns the burner on high and it takes about 15 minutes to heat up his house. He then turns the burner off, and waits another 15 minutes to be sure the gas is out. He then fills up his tank and begins cooking soup again.

Let's call them Jane and Betty and use their average food prices. Let's also divide the total amount they spent from the first question by each person. Thus, the total spent is $800 per week. What is the difference between each person's food budget?\nOutput: Jane and Betty each spend $150 each on food per week, $200 each on gas and $100 each on groceries. Jane gets a total of $475, Betty gets a total of $450.\nThat means the total is $475 + $150 = $640.\nSo they each spend $640\nSo the final answer in this case is 640\n\nAnswers\n\nInput: Two people each live in an apartment building of 100 units.

Calculate how many pounds of cooked fresh bacon (including the water) would have to be thrown away before eating 600 calories worth of bacon would be worth one pound of cooked bacon.\nInput: You cook an average of 60 pounds of frozen bacon every week. The amount of cooked bacon is 6 pounds, or 3.2 pounds. You add 3.2 pounds to the cooking temperature every week, resulting in 6.5 pounds that must be thrown out after 5 days. The total amount of cooked bacon is 60+3.2 = 130 and needs to be discarded after 5 days.\nOutput: The amount of cooked bacon you throw away is 6.5 pounds, or 13.2 pounds.\nSo the total amount of unwanted raw bacon is 13.2 pounds\n\nInput: The amount of food that you buy is equivalent to the amount of calories in a pound.

The extra time he needs to spend on working out would be at least $200 per day.\nOutput: As stated in question 4, it must be calculated from the total time taken.

The call volume on this company is so large that three people can spend four hours speaking with sales persons on hold and not have to repeat a single word that was said. The calls come in at the rate that it would be impossible to keep up with the demand for calls.  There are two lines connected to the pay phone. One of the lines is a central control switch. One person makes all telephone calls on the central line.  The other person makes all telephone calls from the second control switch. The calls are then transferred to the second phone and to the pay phone. How many telephone calls does the customer receive in a week?\nOutputs:\n\n Total calls: 1,300 divided by two people = 1,300 divided by 2 days = 300 divided by 4 hours = 200\nIf we take this number divided by 4 hours, then it equates to 200*36 = $200.\nSince the call volume averages 1,300 calls per week, we can calculate this amount and divide it by 4 hours to get 200*36 = $160\nOr, put differently, each call is $160 x 36 = $480\nSo in total the customer is left with $480 a week from the same amount of time that they worked the call from the other number.", "answer": "C: street corner"}

{"text": "They want some sort of convenience.\n\nInput: A man can hold a conversation while he's riding, walking, and driving on two legs. But a woman cannot. The following are some arguments in favor of this claim.\nFirst of all, the man could probably give an entertaining speech and would be at a great social disadvantage (see below).\nMoreover, it's common to be able to tell the difference between the sexes for certain tasks. For example, male nurses tend to ask doctors for help more frequently than female nurses do.\nIn addition, it may not be difficult to figure out what kind of person a woman is. It's easy to tell the difference between a gentleman and a woman without even looking at either one. But it's hard to tell whether the man or the woman is a man if they're wearing a skirt. This is called \"the skirt effect\". A man could definitely hold a conversation while riding on two legs. This is because most men have the ability to hold a conversation while moving on any sort of transport.\nSecond:\nFirst, a man could possibly hold a conversation while wearing a skirt, but he might not be able to hold a conversation while riding a horse (as the horse cannot walk on two legs).\nThe woman would be at a great disadvantage because she could not tell the difference between a man and a woman. This is called the wardrobe effect. The man might be able to talk while riding the bike, but he might not have the ability to talk while moving on a horse because neither a horse nor a bicycle can take two people at the same time.\nThird:\nFirst, the man could probably hear a conversation while riding on a bicycle, but he could not see the conversation, unlike women who could see the conversation from a distance (due to having two eyes).\nThe woman would definitely be able to hear a conversation while she's driving, but she would not be able to see it when she moves.\nLastly, men can listen to a conversation while riding a bike and women can't. This is called \"hearing\" the conversation.\n\nInput:An airplane was traveling from the west coast to the east coast at the rate of 5,000 miles an hour.

How much more is the average rate for a family of four?\nOutput: The $5000 average price for any family is more two-thirds of $100/4. It is approximately 2.4 times as much as the $100 price.\nTherefore, the $5000 price for a family of four is 2.4 x $100/4 = $1200. That is approximately 4 times as much\nThat is, the $1200 total cost of the average family of four is more than twice the $100 total cost for a family of two.\nTherefore, the average cost per family of four is more the two-thirds of that of the normal cost.\nTherefore, four times as much as two equals more than 2 and we are $2500 from doubling the price of bread.

What is the factory saving money wise by not doing a holiday bonus?\nInput: Alice earns $100 a day in Christmas bonuses.  If she gave the factory $50 once a year, she is saving $50 a year in overtime.\nOutput: The factory saves $1000 a year by not doing their Christmas bonuses.\n\nResponse: To what was Alice referring? Her response is an answer to a separate question (answer 2).\n\nExample:\nIn John's office there is a phone with a built-in recording facility that records his conversations.  All he has to do is pick up his phone and press 3 for 3 seconds.  He then hears the conversation.  Let's assume that John asks his wife to make a decision about a loan he is applying for.  As per normal with his phone, if John pressed 3 he started recording.  He then hears their conversation and is then surprised by her answer.  What is his response to the following question?\n\nInput: Let me give you another example:\nLet's take the example of the guy and his wife who had just got married.  John calls his friend to come over to his place.  John tells his friend he is going to change his underwear (his underwear had stains on it).  He asks his friend if he can change his wife's underwear.  Their conversation ends with John asking his friend, \"Did you change his underwear?!\"  What is his response?\nOutput: John was shocked because the guy with wife was not his friend and said \"No!\" John was surprised that his friend was not his friend and asked him \"What do you mean 'wife?'\"  It was hard for John to tell his wife that his friend was not her husband because she and he were new together.  Now John and his wife got a bit confused when John was shocked if his friend had changed his wife's underwear.\n\nInput: A woman has a daughter.

The leech's job was to suck up the blood and then transport it to the surgeon's waiting room.  When the doctor was ready to cut them from the leech, another leech would suck it up and transport it.\nThe second leech would remain in place and collect the blood of the person they were currently sucking and then deliver it to the surgeon.  Later when they were ready to cut the leech they would simply grab the blood bag.  The whole process repeated over and over again. That sounds pretty terrible, wouldn't it?  Well, a leech has a job to do and so do all other animals that work the same way.  The blood bag is there so that it doesn't spill or leak (or get stuck) between the leech and the person.  Thus, the blood bag and the leech don't need to be in the same place at the same time and the leech must never be able to get a hold of both the bag and the blood until that person is ready to be cleaned up.  This makes a lot of sense!\n\nExample 1: \"The doctor removed his gloves and pulled out a hematoma-filled syringe from his pocket. \"Take a spoonful of his own blood\" he said. \"I want enough to last you a month.\"\nTwo different doctors gave this same advice. One doctor took one spoonful of his own patient's blood, poured it into a spoon, and then stuck it into a leech and sucked up the blood.  The other doctor took another spoonful of his patient's blood and poured it into a spoon again, then stuck it into a Leech and sucked up all the blood.\nThe two doctors' solution to this blood problem was to pull out an old-fashioned syringette and draw blood with it. They both felt that, in the long run, this was a more reliable instrument than the new-fangled pen that they relied on in the past.\n\nExample 2: \"The doctor inserted a large needle into your backside and removed a pint of blood.

Let's start with how many people took those 739 million trips, starting at their last count, and go to the number of trips at their last stop.  Let's say you are driving from Chicago, Illinois to New York City, New York.  Using your average travel speed of 22 mph and assuming you have a 10-minute drive each way, the total time you will need to spend driving on your trip is 1.25 hours.  That means that you will have spent 1.25 * 22= 33 hours driving in a month.\nFor fun, let's say each trip takes an additional one hour to drive.  So what does 33 hours mean? It's the same as traveling for 12 days and driving for one day.  How many vacation days does that mean? A full day.  How many days in a month is that? 6.\nSo, if we go to your average travel speed, each day you spent doing nothing (including sleeping) you spent 33 seconds driving each way and another 17 seconds talking to someone.  Now that's about 2 hours per day.  So how many hours did", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

Every two hours he can change his fuel nozzle.  If he runs out of fuel, he can ask the attendant for fuel.  The station has a fuel tank with four fuel pumps.  When the gas station is full, the attendant fills up every pump with enough fuel for three vehicles.  If one vehicle runs out of fuel, the attendant has to find another pump.  At night, the store is dark and there are no other customers.  Which fuel pump does the attendant need to change at the same time?\nOutput: At night, the attendant has to change all four pumps using one hand, but he has a chance to fill up a single pump with just enough fuel. So the total cost of the four fuel pumps is $5.63. If the attendant uses only one gasoline pump and fills it with just $4.64, the price of the tank will be $4.64. However, the attendant will use all four pumps at once and the total cost of the fuel tank will be $464.55. If the attendant fills the last two pumps with $5.00 worth of fuel, the total cost of the tank will be approximately $466.55. If the gasoline tank gets to full and the attendants does not leave $5.00 worth extra fuel, the price of the fuel tank will not increase.\nTherefore, the total cost of filling the tank with gas is $466.55 + $5.00 = $466.55/4 = $475.60\nSo the final answer in this exercise is 750\n\nInput: A group of engineers comes to see the doctor.

Output:\nWhen Mary is the last person in line she will be the last to leave.  That leaves Bob, who is now the last person in line to leave.\nBob is now the last person to leave the appointment, meaning he must stop and wait for Mary. Therefore, Bob will also be the last person leaving the appointments!\nWhen he finishes, he will be in the last line of the office, behind Mary and Sally.\nThis means that both of Mary's children with be the last ones out of the office, at the same time.\nTherefore for a total time of 25 minutes, Mary and her children, plus Bob, will all leave the dentist's office together.\nTherefore total time of 50 minutes + 50 minutes = 75 minutes.\nSubtract 75 + 50 = 25 minutes.  Thus, Mary will be the first one off the office, and the last one to leave, so her total time with her children will be 25 minutes longer than for Bob.\nTherefore total time for Mary is 25*75 = $50.\nTherefore total time total is $50/25 = $25.  As a result, Mary will receive $75 = $150.\nTherefore total time is $150/25 = $150.\nSo total time is $150 for Mary + $150 = $125=$150.  The total cost is $50, not $150.  Therefore total cost is $150$125 = $125.\nTherefore total cost = $125.\nSo total cost is $125.  That is the total cost that Mary's children will receive when they all go together.  So total cost is $125*125 = $125.  Thus total cost is $125, not $150.\nTherefore the total cost is $125\nTherefore total cost is $125", "answer": "D: pool hall"}

{"text": "He found the decorations in the attic B and the boxes A and C were hidden in closet E.\nHe also found the box D and the closet was full of Christmas toys.\n\nInput: He picked the letter S because he was told that a square that large in a straight line would circle the whole circle. If he were walking in space, would a straight line circle the whole planet?\nOutput: That does not make sense. To circle the whole circle, the number needs to be larger or equal to the circumference, which is 2.5. To circle the planet, the number needs to equal or be greater than the diameter of the planet, which is 5.25. To circle the whole planet, the number needs be smaller or smaller than the circumference, which is 1.8.\nOutput: A is not right. If a straight line circles all the planets, I can not find a way that this can happen. For circular orbit (in space), the diameter of a planet has to be larger or equal at least one degree to the diameter of the satellite that the planet orbits. For circular orbit with a diameter equal to the diameter of Earth, which doesn't exist according to our knowledge, the number 4 would be right.\n\nInput: Alice and Bob each pick a piece of candy and put it in a plastic tub.

Assuming your company is producing 10,000 cases of soda, the run time is 0.08 seconds.  So which is better, 5 or 10 pints of soda?\nOutput: If there are 30 people in the warehouse, the order will take no more than 0.08 seconds.\nSo 5 pints are equivalent to 10,000 pints. However, the time it takes you to produce one pint is only 0.08 * 0.08 = 0.06 seconds. Therefore, the number of pints that can be packed is equal to 10,000/0.06 = 0.05 seconds.\nInput: The store bought 5 pounds of carrots yesterday. What is the most you can pack of them for shipping?\nOutput: If you pack 5 pounds of carrots in your warehouse, the maximum the packaging will hold is 5*500 = <<5/500=50>>50 crates of carrots. When you receive them, a crate is a 5\u00d75^5=25\u00d725=100\u00d7100 block block. Therefore each crate holds a maximum of about 25^25^25^25^50 crates. When you ship them from the warehouse to the customer, all these crates have to be filled.\nTherefore the maximum that can be packed using 5 pounds of carrots is about 25^25.75 = 5000 pints\nSince there are 1^5000 = 5^5 = 5100 pints in your warehouse, the run time of your warehouse is 10000/5^500 = 10000 minutes.\nTherefore, the max load of carrots in your warehouse is 5,500 pints\n\nInput: Alice was hired at a local gas station.

Given that you carry 3 people.\n\nOutput:If you put a car to work, you can run away from it easily. But to escape from a runaway car, you have to be more alert and have to run faster. How much can you run away from a car before it catches up and stops you?\nInput:If it has to run 100 km after you, it has to catch up with 1.5 metres distance. So it has to run 100/150 = 5 miles.\nGiven that you are 5.5 meters tall.  Given that car has a speed of 10 m.p.h. And you are 5.5 m. tall.  Given that it has to run 100 m.p.h., it has to catch up after 6.5 metres distance.  So you have to run 50 metres after it catches up.  So this means you have to run 100/90 = 10.7 metres.  So 6.7 metres = 5.5 metres.\nGiven that it has to run 200 m.p.h for 6.5m distance, it has to catch-up after 9 m.m.s.  The last metres are the hardest for a car to catch up.  So at a certain point, you have to run very hard to get around it.  So it should take 10.7 metres after 5 m.m.s for you to get rid of it.  So, it takes you 10.7 m.m.s to get it out of your path.  So it takes 200 m.m.s after 9 m.m,s.\n\nOutput:Suppose", "answer": "D: neighbor's house"}

Can you give a rough guess?\nOutput: Suppose there are 6 people working to accomplish a project with a deadline of 1-2 weeks, with a cost of $1500 for one month's work.\nEach person must work X days/= $1500 X 60 = Y weeks work > = $1000\nIf your guess is right, the total will be $250\nNow, suppose that you are just trying to get up to speed on the project. You don't have a deadline, so it is safe to assume that you could do 2 weeks at most per person. If you do that, the total will be about $250 less than you guessed - $250 divided by 60 = $100\nIf you try to do one month's work, it is likely that you will finish faster than you've estimated because it will take considerably less time. So to determine the total time it will take to accomplish this project, multiplied by 60 is ~$1500.\nNow, suppose that there is an issue where work needs to be dropped because people are not in a position to meet the deadline. In this case, they will simply drop it, because it will take them significantly less time.

Their budget for the year is $450,000. They also lose $10,000 per month to the IRS for tax liabilities.   The state also wants to raise the sales tax by 1% and also wants to cut programs that pay for other people's medical expenses. They therefore try to give themselves a budget surplus to reduce their deficits. They make a plan to give themselves a $75 raise this year.   If the state increases its minimum wage further, it will increase the number of employees by 100 in a single year, which means the state will have a $25,000 per worker budget deficit for this year. It also increases the sales tax, which means total sales tax revenues will also increase by $25,000. Will a 100% increase in sales tax revenues bring the budget deficit down?\n\nInput:", "answer": "E: control"}

To go from one place in a city to a distant place, one must have time to go first. The amount of time will depend on a lot of things, such as the distance between the destinations, the distance of the cities' borders, etc. The amount of time required will depend on a lot. A: at least 20 mins B: 50 mins C: 100 mins D: 1000 mins E: no more than 10 mins\nOutput:\nFirst, make sure that there are enough time to go from one place to another. To go from one place to a distant place, we need time for transportation. We need to take some transport. Therefore, we will take at least 5 cars, for 100 people. If we need more cars, we will take 100/100 = 40 / 10 = 400%\nOnce we have done the calculation, the time in which transportation should take will be the time that will come to an end. If the time needed for transportation is 1000, the amount of time needed to complete transportation will be 1000/100 = 9500.\nThe amount of time needed to go from one point to another point will depend on one's location. At the first place, it will take at least 5 mins, to reach the destination by car. But for the second place, the time required for transportation will be around 80, because it is much longer to reach the destination via conveyance than transportation will take going via land. Furthermore for the second point, it will be around 2,5 mins, to go from this place to the destination by car. This means that if I travel alone and will go from my first point in the city to my second point, the amount for car transportation will be 2,5% = 400%\nSince the amount of time needed for transportation is around 400%, I will need at least a car for transportation. Therefore, I will travel alone. At the first destination,", "answer": "E: freeway"}

D: The people are corrupt, arrogant and greedy. E: The people are friendly, warm, beautiful, full of humor, and filled with generous people.\nOutput: \"People\" has the correct answer if it's referring to people from the United Sates, France, Norway, or China. \"Culture\" refers to the lifestyle of people who live in the area in question. \"Cultures\" would also be correct if it referred to places in Norway, China, or Norway.

How many times do the shoes need to be worn after 2 weeks in order to reach the 100 mark?\nInput: After 2 weeks, 1 pair has worn 100 times, 2 haven\u2019t worn 100 times, and 3 haven\u2019t worn 150+ times\nWhen James wears his sneakers, they last 100 times and when the shoes are wet they last 50 times\nWhen 1 pair of sneakers lasts 100 times and 2 lasts 50 times, then the second pair will last 50 times\nThus, the shoes have worn a total of 100 times (100*=10) and the first pair only lasted 50 times.\nSo the total number of times the shoes will have worn a total of 110 x 50= 120\nTo reach the 100 mark they will have to have worn a total 90 times.\nSo they have to wear 60 shoes = 2*120=240 minutes instead of 2 shoes for two weeks\nThus, the shoes would need about 40 minutes more = 2*120*1=60 minutes for 60 shoes to reach the 200 mark.\nSo after 20 minutes, they would need 40 minutes more = 2 x 120*1 = 120 minutes for the shoes to reach the 200\nSo the shoes are still only using 100% of their total life expectancy.\nSo they still only have about a third of their life remaining, or about 30 minutes left in their shoes, or about 7 hours remaining.\nSo you only have 30 minutes before they are going to start to deteriorate\nThus, they have about 8 hours remaining in them.\nThus, it will take about 8 hours to wear them through, or 80 minutes\nThus, since the shoes don\u2019t have any wear and tear, they should last them more than 8 hours\nThus, they probably won\u2019t last more than 6 hours\nThus, they will need to be washed\nAfter washing, the shoes will be dry, so now you only have 50 minutes", "answer": "D: michigan"}

She buys the following at the store.\nInput: Alice buys 50 pieces of clothing\nOutput: 50 pieces of clothes\nSince Alice bought 50 pieces of clothing, it cannot possibly cost her $5,000.\nHowever, if she bought 10 pieces of clothing instead, then it would cost her $5,050 + $10 = $5,100\nSince Alice sold 10 clothes, it cannot possibly cost $5,100 * 10 = $5,100 * $25,000\n\nInput: Joe cuts up some corn to make three different meals for dinner. His wife Mary will prepare two of them, Joe the third. She will prepare the corn for the dinner that Joe cooks. How many pounds of corn will they prepare at the dinner that Joe cooks?\nOutput: Three\nThe total amount of corn they will prepare at the dinner that the Joe cooks is three * $5 per pound = $<<5*5=50>>50 pounds\nSince Joe cut up the corn, it cannot possibly cost him more than $5,175.\nHowever, the total of $50 * $5 = $<<5*$175-100%>>$175 can.\nSo the final amount spent is $175 * $15 = $<<5*3=50>>50 pounds.\nSo the total amount spent is $50 * $5 + $15 * 3 = $17.5 + $13.5\nThat means their total spend is $77.5\nSo the final answer $77.5\n\nInput: Jim decides to get a new car.

{"text": "For bird pollination each creature earns $18 per day. The average pay of each bird is $3 per night. The average pay of an adult butterfly is $2 per night. Every day, the average pay of each butterfly is $1.50\nSo the final answer for the pollination is $18/$3=$60\n\nInput: A bird pollination agency sends birds to pollinate other berry vines.  The agency pays each bird $1 for 1/50th of a dozen of the vines. Each worker is paid $1 per head as a commission, but must first be approved before being allowed to pollinate a vine. How much commission does the bird pollination agency pay each worker, and how do the workers divide it among themselves?\nOutput: In order to send birds to pollinate vines an average worker must get approval by the agency's board of directors.  Each of these workers would earn an average of $.33 each since birds pollinate a vine that produces $1 worth of berries when in bloom.  The workers must then divide this $.33 among the other workers.\nIf every worker is paid $1, that amount will equal the number of berries produced in that vine.  That would result in an average pay of $1/25 of a dozen berries for each worker\nSo the final answer to the pollination is $1/25/$12=$12/125 = $12/125\nAnd the final answer to the bee pollination is $1.00/$10=$10/125 = $10/125\nAnd the last answer is $12/125\n\nInput: If a bee pollination agency sends bees to pollinate other brambles, the agency will pay each worker $1 for 1/4 of a dozen of the brambles. Each worker is then paid $1 per head to pollinate the nearby brambles. What is the commission paid to each worker, and how did the bees divide it among themselves? Output: The bee pollination agency provides no compensation per head, only a payment to each worker as a commission.  Each worker is then paid a sum per head by the agency as a commission.  The bramble workers divide this commission among themselves according to the number of heads that the bees pollinate each day.\nIf every worker was paid $1, that would total the number of heads pollinated each day. That would result in an annual payment of $1/25 per head\nSo the", "answer": "C: butterflies"}

All the people that Sam left were paid for their time in his vacation.\nSo the final $150 was not earned by Sam.\n\nInput: Alice is a waitress at a restaurant. On a regular basis she makes $120 + tip per shift. On Friday, when the manager's wife leaves Alice $120, Alice feels that an extra $120 is deservedly hers after being the only responsible person there.  So what should Alice do?\nOutput: Alice should wait until her shift is over rather than accepting the tip.  On Saturday, the manager's wife will pay for her meal.  Alice will then be owed $100 + tip.  It is then up to Alice to pay herself the $100 while also tipping the manager's wife.\nSo Alice should work an extra 60 hours in a month to earn enough money to tip the manager's wife AND Alice should keep a normal amount of money herself.  This gives Alice a total of the extra $100 + tip = $200 that she has earned in 1 month.\n\nInput: An ordinary person works full-time at a job for 25 years with a salary of $20,000. One year later, that person, upon retirement, receives a life insurance payout of $1,000,000. What about $750,000?\nOutput: The figure $1,000, 000 is too high to be realistic.\nSince it is too high a number, here is a more realistic number:\n$750,000*100 = $75,000\nSo $75,000 is too high to be a reasonable number to calculate life insurance payout percentages on.\nSince it is a reasonable amount, here is a practical number to answer the question: What percentage do you give to your heirs after that $75,000 has been used up?\nInput: A very wealthy person has many heirs.

That means the average American is earning 40 cents per day.  If the total number of people in this country was 600 million, the poverty line would be 300-350.  How many people in this country can actually earn that little?\nInput: On March 1, 1999, the US Census Bureau calculated the average monthly income of Americans living in poverty.   The Census Bureau used that figure for the standard income (not food stamps) for 1,200,000 households.  If everyone earning minimum wage for all of 1999 earned what the Census Bureau considered the poverty line (40 cents per day), then there would be 400 million people in poverty.  However, because of the differences among household income, the total number of poor people in this country is likely considerably higher.\nInput: Under most circumstances, the number of chickens grown and sold is 20 per day.  If 20 chickens are sold one hour, what amount of eggs, if any, were sold that day?\nOutput: 20*1*20 = 60>60 eggs\nSince the average number of chicken eggs in a day is 60, the total number of eggs the day is 60*1*20 = 320>320 eggs.\nIf there were 20 chickens that you took from a chicken coop on March 1, you sold 160 of them that day.\nIf you had bought the coop that day for $15 a week, the total profit earned would be $160.00.\nThe total amount of cash earned from this sale of chickens that day would be ($160-15*40-160-0) $240.00\nSo the total amount of money earned from this sale of chicken eggs that day was ($240-0*20)*40 = $80\nInput: For each of the years in the year 2001, is there an income tax withholding exemption limit for filing joint returns?\nOutput: There is no income tax withholding exemption limit on joint returns for 2001.\nInput: The average number of miles driven each year is 12 miles.

Every 2 days, 7 of these trucks get loaded and 7 of these trucks get unloaded. If total boxes are 2 days old, how many boxes will these trucks have in them at the end of the two days?\nOutput: (2+7+7+2)/(2+7+7) = 14\nSo the total number of boxes in these trucks will be 14 x 2 = 14\nIf 12 cars are in each truck, and 6 of them are full at the end of 2 days, then these trucks will have 6*12 = 36 boxes at the end of two days.\nIf 6 trucks are unloaded and none of them are full at all, then the trucks will have 36-12 = 24 boxes of boxes left at the end of two years.\nSo the final question is 24\n\nInput: A company has a budget of $20,000 per weekend. The company does not require weekends off. Instead the weekends are spent visiting the company's factory. If the weekend cost $6,000, how much do the factory owners spend?\nOutput: Each weekend costs $6,000.\nSince the company does not require Saturdays off, the business managers of the factory decided to spend the weekends visiting their company's factory.\nSo at the end of each weekend they spent $20,000 on the business's factory budget.\nThat amount is equal to the business managers' personal budget of six Saturdays per month\nThat total must equal $50,000, so the final answer is 50,000\n\nInput: Which is bigger, the moon or the Earth?

{"text": "A horse bet at the Kentucky Derby is $5 and $15.  A bet that a horse wins the Kentucky Derby is $55.  B.  B.  A horse bet is $15 and $50.\nConclusion: A horse bet at a Derby Track is not more than 25% of the normal bet, and a horse bet at an American Southwest track is also not more than 25% less than 25% of the usual bet.  D.  D.  Derby tickets for all events are the same, although the price difference is greater at the Derby.  E. Triple Crown tickets for all events are not as common as the Derby tickets but are also more plentiful at Triple Crown meets.  *In some states, Triple Crown tickets may be unavailable at the track or elsewhere.\nThat means that each horse bet costs 50 cents plus 25 cents per cent of the bet.  The result for a bet at the Derby is 50 cents * 10 = $5 and for a bet at the American Southwest is 50 cents * 4 = $4.  That means a Derby bet costs $5.  It is assumed that people are betting at 100% on the Derby and they will win half of the time.  Thus, there is a 50-50 split of bets (50 cents) if the horse bets $10 and the bettors $20.  If the horse bet $15 and the bettors don\u2019t get it, they will lose $15.\nThat means that the winner of a horse bet at Derby is only 25% of what the bettors are losing, and the winner of a horse race at Triple Crown meets is only 25% of the bet.  Therefore a horse bet at an event with 250% odds would be only 25% of what a bettors loses.\nA horse bet at a track is 25% of what the horse loses, and a horse bet with 50% odds would be just as risky as a bettors 20% chance to win.  The horse bet at the Kentucky derby is 25% of what a horse bet at a track will cost compared to a horse bet at Triple Crown and 25% of what a person bet against horse wins against horse bettors who bet on horse races that cost 25% more.\nThe difference in horse bets at Derby is the same as the difference in horse bets at other horse tracks because the horse races are different at different tracks and Derby is the only horse race people go to.\n\nInput", "answer": "B: kentucky derby"}

{"text": "Waterfalls  Waterfalls  Waterfalls\nThe amount of water needed for any ocean is 2200*4 = <<4000*4=6200>>6000 feet. Because the ocean covers almost the entire land, the total amount of water required would be 4000*6 = <<4000*6=14000>>150,000 feet.\nOf this amount, 6000 feet is used for freshwater and 8000 feet is used for ocean water. The total amount of freshwater is 2400,000 feet, and the total amount of ocean water is 40,000 feet.\nIf the water from the ocean is used for freshwater, the global oceans cover half of the land area. This means that the water needs of the world can be met, and there will not be enough ocean water to cover the rest of the land.\nSuppose that every year a person in the world uses 2000 liters of water.\nSuppose that the average person in the world uses 1200 liters of water a day.\nThat means that the world can only provide 2100 liters of freshwater each year. Thus, the amount of water being used by the earth is 3000 metric tons per year. If all the freshwater was used for freshwater, the world and its oceans might be completely covered.\nThis amounts to a total of 30 thousand years of water from the earth being used for freshwater.\nSuppose that instead of taking this amount of water, the earth and the oceans put 1 million liters of water each into the rivers instead.\nThat means that in 300 years, the earth and the ocean can supply 2000 liters of water each year and the rivers can supply a million liters of water per year. Thus, the total amount of freshwater that the world requires and the water supply can be met.\nSuppose that in 2000 years, the earth has produced 35 billion liters of water. If the water is then put into rivers instead of the sea.\nThe river water would then be used by the earth and that the oceans should store 6000 times the amount of freshwater it used during the 2000 years\nEach year has to have 2000 times as many humans as now exist, so the Earth needs to produce 2000 times as much water to maintain its current production.\nThat means that if, in 2000 years, the rivers become filled, the water supply is finished within 5 years and the oceans become a source of drinking water. That is why the earth and the ocean need to continue to give water to their people for 3,600 years.\nSuppose that", "answer": "D: surface of earth"}

Thus each can, which holds 5 pints, is packed for shipping.\nThus each can holds 40 * 4 = 40 pints of beer\nThus the total number of cans that can fit inside of the refrigerator will be 40*9 = 640*60 = 320 pints of beer\nSo the total number of cans of beer that will fit inside of the refrigerator is 640*120 = 2064 bottles of beer\nEach bottle of beer has a weight of 3.9 ounces.  So 2064 bottles of beer is equal to 5.3 barrels of beer\nThus the final price is $5.99 + $5.59 = $5.99.\nThus this is a gross price, per pint, because there are 64 pints in a beer\nThus the final gross price is $5.97 + $5.96 = $6.00\nThus this is a net price, per pint.

On the other hand, they use 3 machines on a given day 1 time a week.  There is 1 machine that makes a contribution to the gym budget each month.  The person in charge of the gym budget tells which machine makes the contribution each month.\nOutput: In 2007, the gym budget said the treadmill used 25.5% of the total monthly expenses.  Out of that 25.5% was 25 * 2 = 75.5% of the gym expense.  This gave the yearly cost of the treadmill at that gym as $1250, while using the other 49% of monthly expenses on other machines gave the yearly cost\nThus in 2007, the price per machine was $2.99.\nThus the treadmill cost per year is $2.99 + $2.99 = $3.04\nFor each day they operate, the total daily expenses for the treadmill range from $2.99 + 1.25 = $3.04.\nSo this makes up the 50% of their monthly expenses that is the treadmill itself.\nThus one treadmill costs $2.99", "answer": "D: shelf"}

The total cost is $1000. If the child spends another $20 a week, he has spent $1200 in 6 months. What will his earnings be?\nInput: $1000\nThe child spends $2000 in 6 months\nThe total earnings from the ice cream purchase are $1200\nThe total earnings from working at the ice cream factory are $800\nThe total earnings from selling ice cream at grocery stores and parties are $1,500 and $1,000 respectively. The child will earn as much from working the grocery store, parties, and ice cream as he will from selling ice cream at the ice cream factory. At this point, if the child has spent $1200, he has earned $900. The total earnings from this six month period are $1,600\nSo, the child can earn $900 from selling ice cream. Since he is spending $800 on parties, ice cream, and groceries, he has spent $1,500 in six months. Since the average earnings in the US is $800, he is earning $900.

When a person breathes to breathe, each inhales and exhales at the same time, and this action draws air in through the air pocket. There are two primary causes of the air pocket:\na) Because of gravity B) Because of atmospheric pressure\nThus, if the air comes from a point outside of the room where air is not as dense as in the room, the air contains pockets of air near the ceiling and each person's air pocket is equal to the room's ceiling.\nIn addition, a person can also breathe air by moving his/her head or shoulders. An air pocket in the air around a person's head is always present unless some force is exerted on the air pocket, such as a person holding his/her head in his/her hands. An air pocket on a head below the waist, on the other hand, disappears once a head is held up in the air.\nSo, there is always an air pocket on a head at all times unless someone exerts a physical force on it. Therefore, for the air above the head to appear inside the head, the air above the head must be more dense than the air below. However, for air to come through the air pocket, it must be more dense than air below it.\nIf air above the head appears inside the head or if air from outside the head moves through the air pocket in the head, the air inside the head will appear darker than air outside the head. If a person breathes while moving his/her head, when he/she is on the ceiling there will be an air pocket near the ceiling, while when breathing while moving about the room there will be an air pockets along the floor. If a person breathers while moving their head inside the room, the air at the head will appear lighter than air below it. So, in a room full of many people the air above the head and the air below the head will appear the same. However, air that is not moving inside someone's head, such as air on the floor, will appear lighter and darker than air above it.\nWhen the air that is not moving comes from outside the person's head, the air above its air pocket will appear a lighter color than the air below it.

If he writes this software in three weeks, do the five-digit digits of the computer's number count towards the project's length?\nOutput: Since the computer programmer is only spending a week writing the program, his project length should be 3*600 = 3+200 =<<3*600+200=1220>>1220 hours\nThere will be 1220 hours of code written by the computer programmer before the end of the project.\nSince there will be 120 hours of code written by him in the two years he will be working for the company, this leaves him enough time to cover 1220 x 12 = 2480 hours of programming in 2 years. Since he only spent 7 hours on coding the program, he should be able to add 1280*72 = 3680 hours to the two years. In addition, he has been programming the whole year and he has done some overtime. And this is only 3 weeks of programming. If he has a full-time job, and is doing 1 hour every day on the computer, this should add 1280*45 = 3680 hours in 2 years. Hence his project length should be 2*45 * 45 = <<2*45*45=2480>>2480 hours\nThere will be 2480 hours of code written by this one computer programmer in the one year he will be working for this company.

It didn\u2019t work because the block wouldn\u2019t last long.  The inventor added a wooden frame so that the block could float and serve as its own structure to support the model as well as the person.  This model was very successful.  A lot of people worked on this model and even went so far as to produce different versions or different parts of the model that would have to function as its own structure.  The inventor who produced his best model made a fortune. When the model was so popular that many people started to sell their own copies in hopes of making a fortune as well, the inventor\u2019s son came up with the idea of making a large printing press out of the blocks and then selling each individual one as a separate unit.  Many people were outraged over the idea of spending so much money on this type of item.  They wanted to be able to sell a single block for a lot less money so they actually did make an invention that would produce the best possible model without spending an excessive amount of money.  The printing press, however, wasn\u2019t successful. It was just not good enough so everyone who tried to sell their product was met with great skepticism.  The printing press was not only successful in that it actually sold units but it actually became a popular item.\nThe printing press, however, failed.  It didn\u2024t work.

He pays $100 to a barber who cuts his hair every other week.  Each week, the barber makes 100 dollars - $0.08 = $40, and $60 - $40 = $180.  If the barber cuts a man's hair every other week, then, after all expenses are factored in, the barber earns $200 per week.  He also keeps $60.40 worth of men's grooming supplies for himself only, after all expenses are taken into account.\nOutput: How much money each barber can earn?\nInput: The barber earns $120/week after expenses if he cuts hair for 20 hours a week.\nOutput: If he cuts hair for 10 hours a week, then the weekly income is $240.80 = $40 * 10 = $240.80\nTherefore, the total monthly income is $480.10\nIf he cuts hair for 10.5 hours a week, the barber will earn $340.80\nIf he cuts hair 6 hours a week, he will earn $160.40\nTherefore, the total hourly income is $160.40 / 6 = $120\nTherefore, the hourly income is $340.60 / 6 = $120/hour\nTherefore, his rate of income is $140.60/hour\nThus, he will earn $140/hour after expenses.\n\nInput: Mary and John run a barbershop in their village.

For $150 dollars, they could provide him with physical therapy and equipment to hold him so he could be upright.   He had lost all feeling in his hands and legs. He had no problem at all with eating.  Since the trainer could only see him from the side, he had to be given an arm with a special device that could lift it and place it around his shoulders.

They were each given three snow balls and a marshmallow with water and soap and an instruction sheet.  They were asked to count the number of snow balls with fingers crossed so the teacher would know how many snowballs she had. When she checked the teacher’s aid, she discovered that the other teacher had six snowballs and the teacher did not have six snow balls. However, each teacher had only two fingers pointed towards the teacher’s aide. Thus, she decided to use her fingers to count the number of times.  When she began counting the number of times, she quickly discovered that both of her fingers had been counted twice and that she had only one snow ball. She quickly threw this snow ball away and decided to count by numbers. When she began counting the numbers of snowballs, instead of each snow ball being a number, it seemed that the two snow balls she received were actually equal as the average number of snow balls in a stack. Instead of each snow ball representing 1 or 5, it seemed like each snow ball represented 6 or 8, both of which were considered equal numbers.  Since she had only one snowball, she decided that the two snow balls were the average snow balls in a stack – an even number that represented both her and the teacher’s aides ability to count.  When she learned that the teacher had four snow balls, she decided the teacher had the superior ability to count and that the average snow ball was not an even number and therefore no one could accurately count the number of snowballs by fingers. She then decided to count the teacher’s snowballs one by one and each time the teacher had only one snow ball, she realized that what appeared to her as an even number was actually odd. Thus she had decided that 2 was not the average snow ball but was actually twice as large as the teacher would ordinarily count a normal snow ball and two of her fingers were counted twice. As she realized this, she realized that the teacher had seven snow balls. When she calculated the number of snow balls it was determined that she could count by fingers crossed each time and had therefore missed the teacher’s total snow ball count. When she began counting to 10 and realized that she had been counted twice by using both of her fingers, she counted all of her snow balls by hand and added them together to count the average snow ball. When she then counted to 20,

So if no one else ever kisses you again, or no other person kisses you the rest of your life, then this was a kiss.<n>Output : Yes!<n><n>

Most of them completed the assignment; however, only 3 students attempted to submit their work.  The professor had to grade the work of the 3 students that had not submitted the work. The professor was confused as to which ones were in the low-performers category, and which ones were in the high performers category. To solve this question, the professor assigned points to each of the 4 students and assigned the number of points the students received to the ones in the low performers and the those in the high performers categories. This was supposed to be a problem in which each student should be assigned a rank in the order in which they performed, but in practice, the class quickly devolved into a game of which students were assigned which points. This question gave the professor a good chance to evaluate who was capable of submitting work and who was not, which caused other problems, such as a student getting points for completing the assigned activity but getting no actual credit for the assignment, or getting points for completing the assignment but not submitting the work. To solve this problem, the professor had to assign points to those who were in the low performers in the class, but he also had to assign points to the higher performing students, which made the task appear to be a game and the solution was less clear. In practice, the professor solved this problem by only assigning points to those who were getting credit for the assigned task, and awarding any points that they earned to someone who had not performed the assigned activity, or awarded some fraction of the points to a student who had completed the assigned task but not submitted the work.

Bill decided there that he was going to marry Joan and retire with her in the home.  One week later, after a year in the home and spending only $50,000, he gave up his dream and sold the home to someone else for less than $100,000. In six months Bill and Joan spent all of the money that they had saved up from all of the time they spent living in the home.  They lost all of their savings except $20,000 that they had saved to live on in their retirement.  When Bill and Joan finally retired, Bill wanted to keep his house just like he had saved the money for, but Joan was so distraught and devastated that he gave into her request for a home selling the house for twice what she paid.

During the first year, Alice takes on more and more housework, Bob has less and less time for play and adventure and is a little sad about it. Alice notices a squirrel chewing through an old stick and thinks it will help them keep the house clean.  She takes out an old wooden shovel and whacks a stick into the squirrels house and they are really glad it was there and never thought anything of it.  The squirrels find the shovel very useful.  After two years, the house is now empty except for the tools stored in it.   The squirrels are now very sad about leaving the house.

It's the most famous fairy tale in literature, and it features a number of characters, including the most infamous villain of all--Duke Henry.  In the story, Henry asks Cinderella -- one week after her wedding to the handsome prince -- to help him to escape from the kingdom of Welfred for the first time. Henry is one of the most powerful and dangerous men in Germany. Cinderella tries to help Henry escape, because she loves him and knows how to fight.  I like this story because Cinderella is a warrior princess, and Henry is her prince and guardian.  It is written in the first person, and the relationship between the two is very well written.<n><n>Questions For Assignment:<n><n>1) Is it better to give or take something as a gift?<n><n>2) How should you use punctuation in an essay?<n><n>3) What is the main lesson you learned from "Cinderella"?<n><n>4) What do you think were the three main points of the story?<n><n>6) How would you describe the ending?<n><n>7) What is your favorite section of the story?<n>8) What are your favorite characters?<n><n>9) What are your favorite songs in the story?

He stops by a furniture store to get an artificial cherry tree for his desk. He sees a model tree with no branches. He grabs the model tree in his hand and walks towards the store. He walks into the store. The sales clerk is surprised and asks what he wants. He tells the sales clerk to look for the model tree with no branches; he will see it in the back. Before he leaves the store he drops the 2 branches that he picked up; he does this once more. The salesman still cannot see the tree but says, "Yes sir, there it is. I will have your car ready to take it to the show room." He tells Jack his name, and he is shown to the show room where the salesman takes the model tree out. In the car, Jack notices "No trees." Jack takes his new tree home and shows it to his wife. She complains: there is no place to hide the tree when it gets big. He suggests getting a new house. She points out that she does not like the way the tree looks. Jack points out that he can trim the tree anyway; if she wants a Christmas tree she should get one that has branches, too. He suggests she find something else. She says, "I don't need another Christmas tree, but if you insist on a tree in my house I will not let you trim it." Jack picks up the car and drives off. At home, he realizes that he is not going to have a Christmas tree anymore. He complains to his wife about his "Christmas tree dilemma." She tells him not to be so stressed, and he leaves the house. At the store, he notices that they do not have a tree with branches. They have some fake ones. He goes back to the store where the salesman still has the tree. Jack talks to him, and tells the salesman to sell him another tree. The salesman tells Jack that he will be unable to get another tree immediately because the store is closing soon, and he does not know when he will be able to sell another one. Jack complains loudly at the store and to his wife. She argues that they are going to lose a real Christmas tree and not a fake one. Jack starts walking back to the town hall to get other options such trees with branches. After walking back, he stops by the furniture store and asks them if they have a tree with branches, too. They are not able

One group is asked to write a book report in which they give an overview of their assigned work's contents, and the other group is required to write a book report consisting only of selected passages from their book. Each group's reported book reports will give the same information about a book's contents, but they will give two different explanations. Each group's reports will be very similar except that the reports will cover a different book's contents only (i.e. each report will cover only selected passages from one version of a book, whereas each report covers all the content of another version of the same book). The professor will ask each group to select from their book reports a sentence that summarizes the key points they believe the researchers will want to know and to send all their reports to the other group for comments. The groups will need to make their reports in one day since the time they need to spend writing is approximately half that of the researcher. The comments the professor wants to hear should be either one or two sentence, usually one sentence. An example is given.  If:   A.

The median is the midpoint of two or more points on a graph.  The average is the value that divides two points on a graph where the other is the average – i.e. the median.  If you divide any two points on a graph together, the average is the value that the average divides the other.  If you divide the third point on the graph, the average is the average divided the other two.  If you divide two points in such a fashion that the median is on each point, and you get the fourth point on the other two, you have a fourth point on the other three.   If you divide one point on a graph onto the other, you get one third of the total length of the line.  If you divide a third point on a graph onto both the other two, you get one-third the original length of the line.<n>Input: The mean - the square root of the median.<n>Output: 2<n><n>Input: The average velocity (on the surface) of a car traveling 30 m.p.h. is 42.6 kilometers per hour; whereas the average speed of the same car traveling 30 m.m.h. is only 24.8 kilometers per hour.

Choices:  A: nice feeling B: good karma C: respect D: new freedom E: good heart<n>Output:		 A<n><n>Input: It is a 100-degree day.   If I let out the door that is a 1 year old window, it will lose 2/3rds of its heat capacity.  If I let it out the next day it will lose 1/2.   If I have to live the next 5 years in an environment with 1/2 air conditioning, I will only be able to function at 30-70%.   If I can do 100% of my tasks for 3 months without needing AC, I can afford to live here as long as I like.   If I die and have to live in 1 year old air, I can't possibly survive the winter months.  If I have time, I will do what would be the easy thing.  If I have only a few hours, I will make the hardest decision.  If I have no time, I don't make any decisions.  If I have plenty of time, I make the hardest decision because I know there is so much that lies ahead.

When it fails and won't turn on.  The unit is designed to function and keep me cool.   At night if I would leave my window open, it would run in cold air for 40 minutes in an effort to cool me.  If the unit fails early, I do not have to deal with freezing air.  When I turn the AC on, it may be cold, but it keeps me warm.<n>If it fails early, I have to deal with freezing, but I have my windows open and I let out the door early in a great weather day.  It is cooler by not having to deal with freezing air in the afternoon.  If the units never fail, it is not warm enough in the morning to keep me cold enough in the morning.<n>When it fails early, you have to deal with freezing and not having the ability to get up to a fan.  As a result, I need to use the furnace only during warm days, which is a luxury you have.  When it fails early, I can't stay home all day, which makes a big difference in not freezing.  If it fails early, I don't want to have to waste energy or money trying to

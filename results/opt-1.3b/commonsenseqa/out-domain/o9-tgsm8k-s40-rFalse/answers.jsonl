If he buys everything at once, he will spend all his money on food and house.\n\nThe amount of food spent increases the amount spent on the items.

They were each given three snow balls and a marshmallow with water and soap and an instruction sheet.  They were asked to count the number of snow balls with fingers crossed so the teacher would know how many snowballs she had. When she checked the teacher\u2019s aid, she discovered that the other teacher had six snowballs and the teacher did not have six snow balls. However, each teacher had only two fingers pointed towards the teacher\u2019s aide. Thus, she decided to use her fingers to count the number of times.  When she began counting the number of times, she quickly discovered that both of her fingers had been counted twice and that she had only one snow ball. She quickly threw this snow ball away and decided to count by numbers. When she began counting the numbers of snowballs, instead of each snow ball being a number, it seemed that the two snow balls she received were actually equal as the average number of snow balls in a stack. Instead of each snow ball representing 1 or 5, it seemed like each snow ball represented 6 or 8, both of which were considered equal numbers.  Since she had only one snowball, she decided that the two snow balls were the average snow balls in a stack \u2013 an even number that represented both her and the teacher\u2019s aides ability to count.  When she learned that the teacher had four snow balls, she decided the teacher had the superior ability to count and that the average snow ball was not an even number and therefore no one could accurately count the number of snowballs by fingers. She then decided to count the teacher\u2019s snowballs one by one and each time the teacher had only one snow ball, she realized that what appeared to her as an even number was actually odd. Thus she had decided that 2 was not the average snow ball but was actually twice as large as the teacher would ordinarily count a normal snow ball and two of her fingers were counted twice. As she realized this, she realized that the teacher had seven snow balls. When she calculated the number of snow balls it was determined that she could count by fingers crossed each time and had therefore missed the teacher\u2019s total snow ball count. When she began counting to 10 and realized that she had been counted twice by using both of her fingers, she counted all of her snow balls by hand and added them together to count the average snow ball. When she then counted to 20,", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

{"text": "1\n\nInput: A professor, with a large class of graduate students, assigned each student a task. Most of them completed the assignment; however, only 3 students attempted to submit their work.  The professor had to grade the work of the 3 students that had not submitted the work. The professor was confused as to which ones were in the low-performers category, and which ones were in the high performers category. To solve this question, the professor assigned points to each of the 4 students and assigned the number of points the students received to the ones in the low performers and the those in the high performers categories. This was supposed to be a problem in which each student should be assigned a rank in the order in which they performed, but in practice, the class quickly devolved into a game of which students were assigned which points. This question gave the professor a good chance to evaluate who was capable of submitting work and who was not, which caused other problems, such as a student getting points for completing the assigned activity but getting no actual credit for the assignment, or getting points for completing the assignment but not submitting the work. To solve this problem, the professor had to assign points to those who were in the low performers in the class, but he also had to assign points to the higher performing students, which made the task appear to be a game and the solution was less clear. In practice, the professor solved this problem by only assigning points to those who were getting credit for the assigned task, and awarding any points that they earned to someone who had not performed the assigned activity, or awarded some fraction of the points to a student who had completed the assigned task but not submitted the work.", "answer": "C: hock"}

They paid him $200,000 and he became the owner of the home.  Bill decided there that he was going to marry Joan and retire with her in the home.  One week later, after a year in the home and spending only $50,000, he gave up his dream and sold the home to someone else for less than $100,000. In six months Bill and Joan spent all of the money that they had saved up from all of the time they spent living in the home.  They lost all of their savings except $20,000 that they had saved to live on in their retirement.  When Bill and Joan finally retired, Bill wanted to keep his house just like he had saved the money for, but Joan was so distraught and devastated that he gave into her request for a home selling the house for twice what she paid.  In two years, Bill and Joan bought a used home for only $25,000.  This house cost them nothing to live in and to fix up, and for the next twenty years until Bill died he worked hard to save money and be a successful investor and retire at 80 years of age. In the meantime, Joan continued to be depressed and frustrated that she and her husband did not save the money to live their lifestyle.

(Using the formula of half of the difference and 50% of today's income, John works out that he earns 150% of John's income now.)  (Remember 12 times 2 is 150% of 25) How much does John make one year from now?  (Using the formula 1/2 divided by 1/5 divided by 12 times 2 is 450% of today's income.) How much has John earned this year?  (Using the same method as the \"earn one-third\" question, John's earned income will have doubled in three years.)  (Using the formula 2/3 divided by 2/5 divided by 9/10 times 2 is 360% of today's income. How much more has John earned this year than he has earned in his last 6 years?)  (Note: A waiter will not give you any information about their income in their opening statement.)  (Using formula 2/3 divided x 2/5 x 9/10 times 2, today's earned income can be calculated.

One group is asked to write a book report in which they give an overview of their assigned work's contents, and the other group is required to write a book report consisting only of selected passages from their book. Each group's reported book reports will give the same information about a book's contents, but they will give two different explanations.

I have not been able to come up with a number that means anything) and how do I change the answer so that I can come up with some new problem\n\n1. You need to check how your answer is derived from the solution. If it was derived from the solution, you must answer the question. If it were derived from the problem, you must provide some alternate solution. Or: you must explain how and why your answer is derived from your answer.\n\n2. Your question says that you must come up with a solution. The answer is given in the sentence: You can say that I can say X since I found an answer that satisfies Y. In fact, if I have not found an answer satisfying Y, then I cannot know if X is true. (You might ask what does not satisfy Y?)\n\n3. For every proposition X, let's say, there are propositions Y and Z that can be proved about that proposition. Then the total length of each proposition can be written down as an integer (or polynomial) that represents the number of ways one can formulate those propositions. This integer must be zero if Y exists.\n\n4. Suppose X is the first hypothesis for a proposition Y. Suppose also that X is both true and false (according to the proposition).

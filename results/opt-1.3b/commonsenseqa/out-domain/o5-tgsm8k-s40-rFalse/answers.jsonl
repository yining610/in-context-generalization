{"text": "C\n\nSolutionKey (Answer key, solutions, answers)\nA. She buys more than practical needs. B. Her reasons for shopping more are money and time. C. Choice A. D. C\n\nSolution A: You may get more information on the internet or on the radio or on the news that you may not find in books. This is certainly the case with your books. However, you are probably reading that information from a library. Libraries aren\u2019t like e-books. They don\u2019t have unlimited space. Libraries don\u2019t need to borrow more books even though everyone\u2019s phone bill is skyrocketing. Libraries are going to have money to spare by the next year or so.\n\nSolution B: If you\u2019re determined to shop for something and you go to the store several times, then it\u2019s not just practical needs that motivate you to buy it. A real practical need (e.g., clothing, shoes, cars, etc.) is never listed as one of the options on the shopping carts.\n\nSolution C: Your choices for which choice you need to buy and why are often related to your time.\n\nSolution D: If your choices for which choices you need to shop can be more easily thought through and made while you\u2019re shopping, it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t value the time and money your choices take each time you make them. If I need to work at 2:00 pm (because that\u2019s the time the job requires), my time (which I spend while I\u2019m working) doesn\u2019t have the value at which shopping choices have value.\n\nSolution E: If your choices for purchases you need can be easily thought through and made during the time you need them, it doesn\u2019 t mean you value the time and money you spend on your choices. You probably do shop differently based on which choices you need to buy and when. The fact that you need to think these things is normal, and the fact that you do it does not make doing them any less of an investment in time and money than the alternatives.\n\nSolution F: If the choice is between a product with a high price and a product with a low price, then the price is a more important consideration than the choice of the product. In the same way, price is important but not the most important consideration.\n\nSolution G: You know you need a car, but you", "answer": "A: desire"}

You'll find helpful solutions and the opportunity to post your solutions to the problems that you are having. There will also be other experts that can help you troubleshoot your problems.\n\nMy students asked me if I want to use this in an 8th grade math problem, if so what was I thinking? I did some research and it was not very helpful, however it looks different after further thought, so I am using it. The one problem is\n\nI have 7 male dogs and some female dogs. I put the same number of female dogs on a poster and then draw a line between the poster and the fence (or other type of solid barrier). I show them the poster and ask them to estimate the number of dogs on the line.\n\nIf you draw an object, place a catfish on it, you see that the catfish will only stick on the object on the line that you originally drew. How does this compare to the catfish stuck inside the fence?\n\nIf you draw a straight line from X to Z, but X is between A, B, C and D, the catfish will not be able to get to the X position. If the catfish was caught in a net with a line leading from the X position to A, then the catfish would be able to get to X. What would happen to the catfish if that line were not there?\n\nIf two of your animals run away, each one", "answer": "E: jump"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput: The sun hits the ground 10 feet above the sun before it reaches the horizon. What is the longest time it takes to fully spread its rays? Output: 2 seconds\n\nInstructions:\n1) Make 6 different graphs showing the following data:\nTotal number of days the sun will be directly overhead (sun-day)\nNumber of seconds it takes the sun to fully spread its rays\nDirectional angle between the sun and each horizon (longitude)\nRadius of the sun/horizon lines\n\nThe six graphs are the most efficient graphs:\n\n1. Graph 1 The sun-day has a radius of 4.2 inches. The maximum sun-day overhead time is 10 seconds.\n2. Graph 2 The sun-day reaches the horizon in 5.9 seconds. This is the worst possible angle to direct the rays of the sun.\n3. Graph 3 All six graphs have a very similar time period before the horizon at which the sun is overhead is about the same; 5.9 seconds. Since the time difference between the first graph and that of the remaining graphs is one second (it is not enough for the graphs to be averaged, because that would mean five different graphs with completely different time periods), the sun-day under which those graphs overlap is the same for all six graphs. This is the case even though the angles are vastly different.\n4. Graph 4 The maximum direct rays of the sun are about 45 degrees and, therefore, appear exactly 9.9 seconds apart.\n5. Graph 5 We should use any graph with the shortest time under it (since that is the shortest time that will be measured).  This graph has the lowest time difference.\n6. Graph 6 Our graph is not shorter than graph 4.\n\n**Please make sure you are using the right graph, using the correct chart method (using one of the charts listed above) and making sure to answer the appropriate questions in the chart style guide section.**\n\nAnswer:\n\nGraph 1: The number of days to get an angle of 45 degrees from noon to noon is (0.1 * sun-degree / 365), and a direct ray of that angle strikes the ground at (0.45 * sun-degree / 5 hours * 3 minutes), which is (0.065 * sun-degree / 4-hours * 2-minutes), meaning that the number of days after noon to have an angle of 45 degrees is (15-45-", "answer": "B: history studies"}

The doctor can then insert a rod into the break and the foot will heal on its own. If the patient does not rest the foot on his arm for the duration of the break, the arm will move and the foot will not heal. Dr. Pippin will not let the patient rest his broken leg. Therefore an 8 week wait is not worth the chance that the foot will heal in 8 weeks.\nOutput: A\nInput: 2\n\nLogic\n1. The patient with the broken arm cannot see clearly. The doctor must get the x-ray to clear it so that the patient can rest. If the patient cannot put his elbow above his knee for the x-ray, the x-ray will not be clear. Therefore the patient cannot wait the 8 weeks.  2. The patient must always sit perfectly still so that he can receive the x-ray. After the x-ray is taken, the patient's hands will be all dirty, but the x-ray can show the broken bone, even though the finger was pushed in. Therefore, the patient will need to wash his hands before he can get into the shower. If the patient puts his elbow above his knee, the x-ray should be fine.

The distance between a circle of length L and a straight line, or a point on the circumference of the circle to the same point is called the arc's tangent. If the distance L from any vertex of the circle is equal to the arc length L, then the two triangles touching the circle intersect at a tangent.\nOutput:\nOutput:\n\nAnswer: The length of a right-angled triangle is the same length as the area between its two sides minus its width.  Therefore, a triangle is an area equal to that of a parallelogram (a square that is also a right-angle triangle in the center) if and only if it is a right-angled parallelogram.  If the area of the triangle is larger than the area of the parallelogram, then the triangle is not a right-angled parallelepiped, and its area is equal to the area of its parallelogram.\n\nInput:A straight line extends from the starting point to the end point at a constant rate of speed.

How fast does the plastic trash travel?  Is there any method of tracking it over the next 10 years?\n\n If you have a group of 5 people, every other month, they can each draw a square and color in a square area of the square, from the center to the edge.  When they have done that, someone draws one of those squares and shows it to another person.  When they have been exposed to a particular square area, then another person takes over the square area.  When each person has been exposed to a different square area, then the square area gets rearranged.  Each group member has a separate square area, and this is arranged in a way to show the square area of every other group member.  At the end of the event, each square area is turned over to a new group member and the square areas get rearranged again.  No matter how many squares are turned over, every person has seen one square area.  For every person, the pattern is different at almost every point, and everyone always gets exposed to at least one square area per square.  All 5 people end up exposing to one square area per square, no matter how many squares are made up of one space.  The square area pattern is so large that the squares must be painted every time.  Because of the small shape of the canvas, the squares cover a lot of square area.  The numbers drawn on every square number show how large the squares are.

If the room temp drops to 20 \u00b0F the ambient air temp would drop to 25 \u00b0 F, assuming the air temp is 10 \u00b0 F lower than the room temp. If the air temp is 40 \u00b0F but in the rooms air is at 5 \u00b0F the air temp would drop to -10 \u00b0F, assuming the air temp was 10 \u00b0F lower than the room temp, if the air temp is -10 \u00b0F and the air temp is 5 \u00b0F in the rooms air,the room temp will drop to -10 \u00b0 F.The temperature needed to be 20 \u00b0F to be equivalent to the room temp. If we assume the room was at 60 \u00b0F, and the room temperature dropped 20 \u00b0F we would need an ambient air temperature of -25 \u00b0F for the room temperature to drop to 10 \u00b0F. The room temperature would only need to be 16 \u00b0F to attain -10 \u00b0F. So either the ambient air temps are too low for the room temperature to be that low or the room air temperature is too high. This does not mean the room temp is too high or too low, but rather, for the room temp to be 10 \u00b0F and to go down to 10 \u00b0F we need a room air temps of -", "answer": "A: home"}

First, the boy on the right was a little surprised that the bell rang when only two people were in class, but after realizing it was for a second bell instead of an extra bell and only when the kids are already in class it became obvious that that was the reason for the bell ringing twice.

If the playing continues after that, but there are only 2 people on stage, then the next person to play is the loser.  If there are 4 people on stage and only 2 people have played in 3 hours (i.e.:  B&D) then the next person on stage is the winner.  After each hour's playtime, there are only 3 people on stage.  The winner is the person who hasn't played at the time that the person who has played has, but they get credit for the final song because the song is played at the same time.  For example, the 1pm Song that starts at 3, and the 1pm Song that finishes at 2, and the 3pm Song that starts at 5, and the 3pm song that finishes at 4.  The winner is always the person who has played at the last time that the winning song was played - so if the song's time goes to 5:00 and the last song has started, the person who hasn't started playing yet is no longer the winner.  Because there is only 3 people on stage at any given time, every person is always playing after the last person.  So the 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, and 5 pm song times can never have someone else play at any of them.\n\nInput: There are 6 people (including you) at an outdoor swimming pool, all sharing a locker room.

The robot will have one arm that doesn't rotate and that arm moves freely but can't get up. The robot's arms will always be in the same place because every motion it makes requires a reaction in relation to somewhere else and each reaction is connected to another somewhere else. The robot can only move one arm at a time. That other arm may just happen to be the robot's hand - but it may also be the robot's mouth. When Dave tries to tell the robot he can be less talkative at work, the robot responds with \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\".\nOutput: B\nYou might also notice that the robotic head sits on a little stool which is supposed to look like a human head. As we learned in class, the head and the arm will never be in the same place in relation to each other because they always have to move in relation to some other part of the robot.\nYou can see in the diagram below that the legs, arms, and head all move in different directions.  The reason they all move in different directions is because they all have to react to what's outside their own field of perception (the robot head) as well as to what's inside their own field of perception.\nOutput: C\n\nInput: When Betty saw Betty over the edge, how many steps back did she have to move in order to avoid a drop?\nInput: 10\n\nInput: Bill noticed a pair of sandals with broken seams along the outside of the sole.

And if it's burning on a\nlarge scale (nuclear power stations), then it's also burning on a large\nscale (fire). It causes a lot of waste and a lot of water, a lot of\nradioactivity, and the whole process is dangerous.\n\n2: Nuclear power is the most economical fossil fuel since it does not\ncreate greenhouse gases. It also produces no waste.\n\n3: A nuclear power plant uses less fuel than a coal - power plant.\n\n4: Electric power plants produce twice as much greenhouse gases and a\nthird of twice the waste than coal - powered power plants.\n\n6: Nuclear power plants generate less energy per unit of fuel than fossil\nfuel plants: Nuclear plants require 6.4 terabytes to generate 1 terabyte\nof energy.\n\n7: If a nuclear power plant burns coal (with no more than 2,700 lbs of CO2 per\nhour on average), the plant would have to burn about 2 million pounds of\ncoal each year to produce the same electricity as a coal plant.\n\n8: A nuclear power plant burns twice as much fossil fuel as it does coal.\n\n9: Using fossil fuel to produce nuclear power would take about 10 times\nlonger than it takes to produce nuclear power (2 to 3 years vs. 3 to 4\ndays).\n\n10: Nuclear is the least polluting fossil fuel available.\n\n11: It makes the most pollution of all, except for hydroelectric and\nwind.\n\n12: It is the safest one.\n\n13: The only way to avoid disaster is to put your life in the gas guzzler,\nlike an American.

Multiplying the square of 100 by 0.5 gives us 26.5. Dividing by 16.0 gives us 42.0. C is 5.56. Therefore, C multiplied by 4.56 = 27.46, and D multiplied by 4.56 is 27.16. Therefore, D multiplied by 4.16 is 27.36 (or, in decimal form, 18.4).  This equates to 54.8.  Multiplying 18.4 by 1.06 gives us 54.33. Dividing the square of 54 by 2.0 (the square root of 2) gives us 26.87. C is 27.33. Therefore, D divided by 27.87 is 27.16.

In reality, however, it is more likely that they are driving at different speeds. Let's consider a second example of car A and car B driving at speeds of 40 and 80 miles per hour, respectively, for one minute and one hour. Let A continue to drive while car B brakes only as needed. While doing so, car A moves slightly to the right of car B, and as a result, car A moves slightly further right on the line than car B does. Finally, car B brakes to a stop and continues to drive at an equal speed as well.\n\nBy the end of that one hour they will both be farther right on the line, but car B will still be 15 feet behind car A\u2019s position on the line. To get to car A from A, cars A and B must drive for 15 seconds and then take turns driving. As soon as one person starts driving after the other, the person following will begin to drive ahead of them and will only be able to see their cars when that person starts driving. Eventually, cars B and A will arrive at A, but it will be at least fifteen seconds too late for the person to start following them.\n\nThis means that since everyone is going 80 miles per hour, the line will still be 5 feet longer and the turn will be 15 seconds further right than it would have been if both people stopped for the stop sign or not at all. You would need to drive 5 or 15 seconds behind the car that was following the car that was not following them. The same will be true once cars B and A arrive at A. Again, this is only going to work if the person", "answer": "B: office"}

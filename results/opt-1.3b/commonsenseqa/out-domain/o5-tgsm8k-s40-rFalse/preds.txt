Choices:  A: desire B: money C: time D: credit E: spending money<n>Output:		 C<n><n>SolutionKey (Answer key, solutions, answers)<n>A. She buys more than practical needs. B. Her reasons for shopping more are money and time. C. Choice A. D. C<n><n>Solution A: You may get more information on the internet or on the radio or on the news that you may not find in books. This is certainly the case with your books. However, you are probably reading that information from a library. Libraries aren’t like e-books. They don’t have unlimited space. Libraries don’t need to borrow more books even though everyone’s phone bill is skyrocketing. Libraries are going to have money to spare by the next year or so.<n><n>Solution B: If you’re determined to shop for something and you go to the store several times, then it’s not just practical needs that motivate you to buy it. A real practical need (e.g., clothing, shoes, cars, etc.) is never listed as one of the options on the shopping carts.<n><n>Solution C: Your choices for which choice you need to buy and why are often related to your time.<n><n>Solution D: If your choices for which choices you need to shop can be more easily thought through and made while you’re shopping, it doesn’t mean you don’t value the time and money your choices take each time you make them. If I need to work at 2:00 pm (because that’s the time the job requires), my time (which I spend while I’m working) doesn’t have the value at which shopping choices have value.<n><n>Solution E: If your choices for purchases you need can be easily thought through and made during the time you need them, it doesn’ t mean you value the time and money you spend on your choices. You probably do shop differently based on which choices you need to buy and when. The fact that you need to think these things is normal, and the fact that you do it does not make doing them any less of an investment in time and money than the alternatives.<n><n>Solution F: If the choice is between a product with a high price and a product with a low price, then the price is a more important consideration than the choice of the product. In the same way, price is important but not the most important consideration.<n><n>Solution G: You know you need a car, but you

At the next intersection, someone comes to take out a trash can on his right and the car enters the street. The owner of the car comes over to thank him for his time and the man offers to hold the trash can. The other three car drivers pass him on their left as he continues to walk right. He looks around and sees that he is far away from home and does not know where he is. He sees a shop sign on a tree, so he goes in.

In the very next moment, he is knocked unconscious by a car passing him on the sidewalk. The car drives out of the store without offering to give him his keys.

What is the longest time it takes to fully spread its rays? Output: 2 seconds<n><n>Instructions:<n>1) Make 6 different graphs showing the following data:<n>Total number of days the sun will be directly overhead (sun-day)<n>Number of seconds it takes the sun to fully spread its rays<n>Directional angle between the sun and each horizon (longitude)<n>Radius of the sun/horizon lines<n><n>The six graphs are the most efficient graphs:<n><n>1. Graph 1 The sun-day has a radius of 4.2 inches. The maximum sun-day overhead time is 10 seconds.<n>2. Graph 2 The sun-day reaches the horizon in 5.9 seconds. This is the worst possible angle to direct the rays of the sun.<n>3. Graph 3 All six graphs have a very similar time period before the horizon at which the sun is overhead is about the same; 5.9 seconds. Since the time difference between the first graph and that of the remaining graphs is one second (it is not enough for the graphs to be averaged, because that would mean five different graphs with completely different time periods), the sun-day under which those graphs overlap is the same for all six graphs. This is the case even though the angles are vastly different.<n>4. Graph 4 The maximum direct rays of the sun are about 45 degrees and, therefore, appear exactly 9.9 seconds apart.<n>5. Graph 5 We should use any graph with the shortest time under it (since that is the shortest time that will be measured).  This graph has the lowest time difference.<n>6. Graph 6 Our graph is not shorter than graph 4.<n><n>**Please make sure you are using the right graph, using the correct chart method (using one of the charts listed above) and making sure to answer the appropriate questions in the chart style guide section.**<n><n>Answer:<n><n>Graph 1: The number of days to get an angle of 45 degrees from noon to noon is (0.1 * sun-degree / 365), and a direct ray of that angle strikes the ground at (0.45 * sun-degree / 5 hours * 3 minutes), which is (0.065 * sun-degree / 4-hours * 2-minutes), meaning that the number of days after noon to have an angle of 45 degrees is (15-45-

The adults rowed one boat and the children rowed the other two boats. If the boat that is the furthest along from shore reaches land first, then the other boats all proceed in a straight line along the shore on their own, then the line formed by the boats that traveled beyond shore remains. Which direction were all the boats traveling 6 hours after traveling from shoreward?<n>Output:<n>The answer indicates that if each boat is traveling at the same speed (3mph) it is possible for them to maintain their positions in the river. It would be impossible to create a line in the river by them moving in a straight line. Their only option would be to turn around and head back to the shore and back to the stream. Only one of the four turned their boats back to shore and head back to shoreward from the river toward shore.  If the boat moving furthest from shore reached land first, then the rowers all turn toward the landward. Only the boat moving nearest shore toward shoreward from shoreward from shoreward can form a solid line without turning around.<n><n>Input:A man was at his computer all day.

I am not at that level, therefore, I am not at the stage of developing a skill that is needed to make that judgement call. I would not have had an answer to B if I did not have any information about the product. Therefore, I have no input on either item B if I did not know that it was priced higher than the average in that field. Therefore, I have answered D. I would simply adjust my offer of the good to make sure I am getting full value in return for what I am selling them. If there is no value added, I would have no problem increasing my rate for that product to the next level, but I would still take the deal on offer because if there was a price difference, I am making good money for the item and the customer has already made the effort to go and see what it is like, so I am not really losing out.

They begin to go home at two in the morning. What should they do?  If the friends have to fight off a drunk man, it may be a good thing that the man was drunk so he would not attack them. At two in the morning they ask Dr. Pippins to get them a taxi. How much will they run out of money? How many hours does it take to pay for the taxi?  Also, why do drunk people always take up one stool when the group goes home?<n>Output: 1<n><n>Logic<n><n>Input: The patient with the broken leg should not go to a doctor for 6 weeks because the swelling of the leg will go down enough for the foot to eventually move on its own. The doctor can then insert a rod into the break and the foot will heal on its own. If the patient does not rest the foot on his arm for the duration of the break, the arm will move and the foot will not heal. Dr. Pippin will not let the patient rest his broken leg. Therefore an 8 week wait is not worth the chance that the foot will heal in 8 weeks.<n>Output: A<n>Input: 2<n><n>Logic<n>1. The patient with the broken arm cannot see clearly. The doctor must get the x-ray to clear it so that the patient can rest. If the patient cannot put his elbow above his knee for the x-ray, the x-ray will not be clear. Therefore the patient cannot wait the 8 weeks.  2. The patient must always sit perfectly still so that he can receive the x-ray. After the x-ray is taken, the patient's hands will be all dirty, but the x-ray can show the broken bone, even though the finger was pushed in. Therefore, the patient will need to wash his hands before he can get into the shower. If the patient puts his elbow above his knee, the x-ray should be fine. Therefore the patient can wait the 8 weeks for the x-ray to

In any given week the chances of two people being killed one day are very low, and on average the chances of two people dying in one day are extremely low.

The distance between a circle of length L and a straight line, or a point on the circumference of the circle to the same point is called the arc's tangent. If the distance L from any vertex of the circle is equal to the arc length L, then the two triangles touching the circle intersect at a tangent.<n>Output:<n>Output:<n><n>Answer: The length of a right-angled triangle is the same length as the area between its two sides minus its width.  Therefore, a triangle is an area equal to that of a parallelogram (a square that is also a right-angle triangle in the center) if and only if it is a right-angled parallelogram.  If the area of the triangle is larger than the area of the parallelogram, then the triangle is not a right-angled parallelepiped, and its area is equal to the area of its parallelogram.<n><n>Input:A straight line extends from the starting point to the end point at a constant rate of speed.

A is very old and was born in 1920 and B was born in 1949. Both A and B suffer from arthritis from getting older but A's arthritis has become worse.  Both A and B are afraid to lose their mobility because of their arthritis but A's arthritis is also causing B to lose some of his movement strength as well.   B has arthritis that is on the left side of his body (left elbow) and A has arthritis on the left side of her legs, from her heel to the knee.  A's arthritis is due on the left side of body (lower back) and B's arthritis is on the right side of her body (upper legs from the knee to the shin), and both A and B work very hard at reducing the pain of the arthritis.   A and B are both trying very hard to maintain a balance of their lives that is not impossible for both of their legs and arms, but A's arthritis has gotten so bad that he cannot keep up.  B's arthritis has gotten so much worse that he cannot keep up and when A needs his help, B becomes frightened that he may lose all of his mobility and be unable to help. B and A don't want that.  A and B have both lost mobility, but A's has become a chronic condition (in his early 70's and still not going to go away) while B's pain has gotten so bad that it has caused him to forget about everything he does and has turned him into an introvert because of it. A and B love each other very much, but A's arthritis may force B to live in a house with someone else instead of being with someone he loves.   B wants to be loved, but because of his arthritis he has to love himself. B is trying to take care of himself, but he has become a burden to himself because of his arthritis.   Neither of these people is in good health. A and B are both at very high risk for suffering from the other person's arthritis. A has arthritis that is on his left side (shin). B has arthritis that is in front of the left ankle.  Arthritis of one joint doesn't cause arthritis of the other, and arthritis in both knees doesn't cause arthritis in both legs.  A and B don't want arthritis on the left of their bodies.  They don't want arthritis that can turn their

How fast does the plastic trash travel?  Is there any method of tracking it over the next 10 years?<n><n> If you have a group of 5 people, every other month, they can each draw a square and color in a square area of the square, from the center to the edge.  When they have done that, someone draws one of those squares and shows it to another person.  When they have been exposed to a particular square area, then another person takes over the square area.  When each person has been exposed to a different square area, then the square area gets rearranged.  Each group member has a separate square area, and this is arranged in a way to show the square area of every other group member.  At the end of the event, each square area is turned over to a new group member and the square areas get rearranged again.  No matter how many squares are turned over, every person has seen one square area.  For every person, the pattern is different at almost every point, and everyone always gets exposed to at least one square area per square.  All 5 people end up exposing to one square area per square, no matter how many squares are made up of one space.  The square area pattern is so large that the squares must be painted every time.  Because of the small shape of the canvas, the squares cover a lot of square area.  The numbers drawn on every square number show how large the squares are.  The larger the square number, the more square area gets covered.<n>Output: 54<n>*<n><n>Input: Every week on Wednesdays, 5 different groups of five adults leave work.

Can the temperature fall so quickly that it turns into an ice cube?<n>Output : B<n><n>Input: __________________________________________ _________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________<n>Solution:<n>In a hot room the room temp is 60 °F. If the room temp drops to 20 °F the ambient air temp would drop to 25 ° F, assuming the air temp is 10 ° F lower than the room temp. If the air temp is 40 °F but in the rooms air is at 5 °F the air temp would drop to -10 °F, assuming the air temp was 10 °F lower than the room temp, if the air temp is -10 °F and the air temp is 5 °F in the rooms air,the room temp will drop to -10 ° F.The temperature needed to be 20 °F to be equivalent to the room temp. If we assume the room was at 60 °F, and the room temperature dropped 20 °F we would need an ambient air temperature of -25 °F for the room temperature to drop to 10 °F. The room temperature would only need to be 16 °F to attain -10 °F. So either the ambient air temps are too low for the room temperature to be that low or the room air temperature is too high. This does not mean the room temp is too high or too low, but rather, for the room temp to be 10 °F and to go down to 10 °F we need a room air temps of -

The man had no money to pay for the shoes and said "If you will wait a few minutes"  The clerk said "No, I will have to leave you by myself."  The man thought about this and decided to wait until the doorkeeper came and went.  Then, while the doorkeeper was in the bathroom, he called his wife and asked her to come along and spend $50.00 for the pair of shoes.  The clerk agreed and after the doorkeeper and his wife left, the man asked "Now I need to go back to work."  The clerk replied "I know that now"  The man was very irritated and said "I am going to try to find out why this person would be so mean to me and tell him why I think he was so rude."  The first thing that came in his mind was the woman who had been rude to him in the store.

First, the boy on the right was a little surprised that the bell rang when only two people were in class, but after realizing it was for a second bell instead of an extra bell and only when the kids are already in class it became obvious that that was the reason for the bell ringing twice. He then realized that, as is often the case, the sound of the bell comes directly from the school, coming from the front door just past the students waiting for the elevator.

After realizing that, the boy was even more confused. So he noticed the other teacher that day who also happened to be the first to notice the second bell, and they both sat quietly with hands clasped. They only realised what was happening when someone on the opposite wall, behind them, suddenly became quiet. Then, slowly, everybody sat looking at these two teachers, each with one hand loosely clasped.

If the playing continues after that, but there are only 2 people on stage, then the next person to play is the loser.  If there are 4 people on stage and only 2 people have played in 3 hours (i.e.:  B&D) then the next person on stage is the winner.  After each hour's playtime, there are only 3 people on stage.  The winner is the person who hasn't played at the time that the person who has played has, but they get credit for the final song because the song is played at the same time.  For example, the 1pm Song that starts at 3, and the 1pm Song that finishes at 2, and the 3pm Song that starts at 5, and the 3pm song that finishes at 4.  The winner is always the person who has played at the last time that the winning song was played - so if the song's time goes to 5:00 and the last song has started, the person who hasn't started playing yet is no longer the winner.  Because there is only 3 people on stage at any given time, every person is always playing after the last person.  So the 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, and 5 pm song times can never have someone else play at any of them.<n><n>Input: There are 6 people (including you) at an outdoor swimming pool, all sharing a locker room.

Output:A<n><n>Output: What would a three-armed robot that's self-adjusting to the weather be able to do?<n>Output: A<n>You'll notice that the robot doesn't have legs, it just has arms and a head which sit right next to each other. The robot will have one arm that doesn't rotate and that arm moves freely but can't get up. The robot's arms will always be in the same place because every motion it makes requires a reaction in relation to somewhere else and each reaction is connected to another somewhere else. The robot can only move one arm at a time. That other arm may just happen to be the robot's hand - but it may also be the robot's mouth. When Dave tries to tell the robot he can be less talkative at work, the robot responds with "I'm sorry! I'm sorry!".<n>Output: B<n>You might also notice that the robotic head sits on a little stool which is supposed to look like a human head. As we learned in class, the head and the arm will never be in the same place in relation to each other because they always have to move in relation to some other part of the robot.<n>You can see in the diagram below that the legs, arms, and head all move in different directions.  The reason they all move in different directions is because they all have to react to what's outside their own field of perception (the robot head) as well as to what's inside their own field of perception.<n>Output: C<n><n>Input: When Betty saw Betty over the edge, how many steps back did she have to move in order to avoid a drop?<n>Input: 10<n><n>Input: Bill noticed a pair of sandals with broken seams along the outside of the sole.

When the teacher answered that it would not stop, the boy asked if he could watch her drive by for a little while. A minute later, the teacher pulled over and the boy got off the bus.

Now tell him I'd like to buy him an extra two months in school." The school bus driver said, "You've spent enough time on my bus. I'll drive you home tonight." As the bus had left, the boy's father said, "Maybe I can help you pay for your education." Then the bus driver turned to the boy and said, "And I'm going to be your teacher in the back seat. What you learned today is for the weekend." The boy then responded, "I know that. And I know that I learned a lot today."<n><n>Input: An actor named William is a dentist with a small dental practice.

When John became a director of the company, the president was paid $90,000 a year but made $25,000 a year from his salary.  John's salary increased to $150,000 per year and his salary was the equivalent of John's 5% of $120,000 profit, or $20,000 per year.

He had a friend who was a captain and he thought that he would help the President get home faster, cheaper, easier, and in better working condition.

They agreed that they each would have a 50% bonus on top of their normal salary for the "buddy job" and they would each receive the same salary for their "buddy jobs".  The President agreed to pay $25,000 for the "buddy jobs" and his friend agreed to pay $40,000 for them.  The President calculated the total cost to have both of them come along and they would each receive $45,000 each and John could have 20% of that cost back in bonuses, which made the total cost about $105,000.

Can the gross sales from the business in the next 6 weeks be lessened by the gross revenues lost in the previous 6 weeks?<n>Output:  B a<n><n>Input:Let us first assume the business has $10,000 in sales a month and $10,000 in revenue per month. To figure out how much money the business will make in the next 6 weeks, find the gross monthly revenues minus the gross monthly expenses before calculating the amount of the business. If the revenues of $10,000 are generated by sales of $15,000, the revenue generated by gross monthly expenses of $2,500 minus the revenue generated by gross sales of $10,000 is $4,000. Divide the net revenues of $4,000 by the gross monthly expenses (GDP) and multiply by the gross monthly revenues of $10,500.  The GDP times $10,500 equals $1,080.  Divide the gross monthly revenues by $1,080 and multiply

Multiplying the square of 100 by 0.5 gives us 26.5. Dividing by 16.0 gives us 42.0. C is 5.56. Therefore, C multiplied by 4.56 = 27.46, and D multiplied by 4.56 is 27.16. Therefore, D multiplied by 4.16 is 27.36 (or, in decimal form, 18.4).  This equates to 54.8.  Multiplying 18.4 by 1.06 gives us 54.33. Dividing the square of 54 by 2.0 (the square root of 2) gives us 26.87. C is 27.33. Therefore, D divided by 27.87 is 27.16.  This corresponds to 57.08.<n><n>Input:  The population of San Francisco is 4 million people (population 1 million is 5 times more than the population of San Francisco).

Doberman and Schnauzer are both considered Pomeranians, but they have different coloring and different behaviors; therefore they are categorized as two different breeds.  2. A puppy is any puppy that has been born or is born at least two weeks before the owner acquires the puppy;  4. Doberman and German Shepherd are both German Shepherd breeds, therefore a Doberman or German Shepherd is a mutt rather than a breed.  5. Dobermans and German Shepherds are the only two dog breeds that live alongside cats in the United States.  6. A Schnauzer, the German Shepherd mix's cousin, is more of a mutt, because it is still a dog and a mutt.  7. Most breed-related dog issues occur between owners and their dogs if the owner is unaware of the breed's quirks and characteristics.<n>8. Because Dobermans and German Shepherd were the first two dog types created, they are the only two dog types to live alongside cats, but other dog breeds, such as the Labrador Retriever, do not.  Most people do not have to worry about their dogs running up to the cat, because all dog breeds are friendly towards their fellow living species.   Some people do need to get used to their dogs being close to other dogs, though; some dogs do not tolerate other dogs, especially dogs they consider to be food.

At B, both drive slower, but the car with the brakes on is stopped 15 feet after B’s turn. If both people do not stop for a stop sign at C, the car would go around the bend 15 seconds later than its destination and would have still be 15 feet behind the car that had the turn taken. Let’s call them car A and car B. What happens when one of them drives a straight line at C?<n>Output: neither of them will get to B<n><n>Note: Each answer is a multiple choice question. One is chosen and then used as a final answer.<n><n>The above example assumes that car A and car B are driving equal distances to each other on the same straight line. In reality, however, it is more likely that they are driving at different speeds. Let's consider a second example of car A and car B driving at speeds of 40 and 80 miles per hour, respectively, for one minute and one hour. Let A continue to drive while car B brakes only as needed. While doing so, car A moves slightly to the right of car B, and as a result, car A moves slightly further right on the line than car B does. Finally, car B brakes to a stop and continues to drive at an equal speed as well.<n><n>By the end of that one hour they will both be farther right on the line, but car B will still be 15 feet behind car A’s position on the line. To get to car A from A, cars A and B must drive for 15 seconds and then take turns driving. As soon as one person starts driving after the other, the person following will begin to drive ahead of them and will only be able to see their cars when that person starts driving. Eventually, cars B and A will arrive at A, but it will be at least fifteen seconds too late for the person to start following them.<n><n>This means that since everyone is going 80 miles per hour, the line will still be 5 feet longer and the turn will be 15 seconds further right than it would have been if both people stopped for the stop sign or not at all. You would need to drive 5 or 15 seconds behind the car that was following the car that was not following them. The same will be true once cars B and A arrive at A. Again, this is only going to work if the person

She had a high level of consciousness that day and complained that she was thirsty. At 8 o'clock she was having difficulties remembering to put on her shoes. Dr. Banks ordered her to have a glass of water at 8:15. At 8:25 she again complained that she wasn't thirsty. Dr. Banks called her name 30 times, but she wouldn't answer. She decided to call the doctor's house and left a message. At a quarter to 9:05, Mr. Banks returned the call and asked if he should start the machine or wait for Dr. Banks to get home from work. Mrs. Banks replied that she wanted a glass of water. Dr. Banks asked Mrs. Banks what she thought about starting the machine right away. Mrs. Banks responded that it didn't necessarily need to start right away and that she could wait until she was done taking a break to go inside. Dr. Banks asked several other times and Ms. Harkins, the patient, did the same. Dr. Banks checked the clock just once at 10:05 and asked several times for the same answer.

At 10:40, Dr. Banks called Ms. Harkins to find out if Dr. Banks gave her an answer to her question but Ms. Harkins answered "I don't know." Mrs. Banks dropped her glasses and walked out the waiting room with them.<n>Output: 11<n><n>Input: Two married people walk into a bank and ask the teller if they can open an account.

All questions are from American History. Questions 1, 2 and 5 have to do with the census as a system of accounting to determine your family’s population.  Question 3 asks you to count only women.  Questions 4, 5 and 7 are about how the census determines birth and death certificates, and question 8 is to determine how much the government pays each citizen to fill out the census.  Questions 9 and 10 look at how the census determines who is employed and who is unemployed.  Questions 11 and 12 are designed to test your knowledge of math and reading skills.  Questions 13, 14 and 15 ask you to divide the entire population into 10 groups of 10.  Each group is made up of three numbers.  There are eleven groups.  Answers to the questions can be found in the question cards provided in each of these sections. Questions 1-2 have to do with money. Question 3 and 4 give you an interesting exercise to remember the answers to your neighbors’ names.  Question 5 gives you good practice for the next test.  Question 6 asks you to guess how many cows must be slaughtered to fill in a census field.  Question 7 requires you to count the number of students in a year.  Question 8 asks you to look at the chart below and tell where two or more items intersect.

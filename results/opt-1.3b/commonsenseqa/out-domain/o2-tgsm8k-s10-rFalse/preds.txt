One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: 4<n><n>Input:To locate a choker not located in a jewelry box or boutique where would you go? Choices:  A: jewelry store B: neck C: jewlery box D: jewelry box E: boutique<n>Output:		 3<n><n>I'm pretty sure that Adam's purchase of one kilogram of nuts and one kilogram of dry fruits was $8, which is 10% more than my $2.50 estimate. Adam didn't spend $12 on nuts either, which is why my guess is less than 50%.<n><n>I'm also guessing that he used a local jewlery shop, not a chain like Jared's or Piercing Pagoda, which would be about what I expected.<n><n>So, which of the 2.5 kg of nuts cost $12? I'm guessing he was planning on going to the jewelery shop even if it took him a bit longer to get there.<n><n>You didn't say how much time he spent at each day. I think it's more likely to purchase $1 worth of chocolate or $2 worth of cookies or both before stopping to prepare for a workout.<n><n>The store was at "C" in the list.<n><n>My guess is that Adam paid $12 for the nuts.<n><n>Edit: This comment is no longer worth commenting on. It's just you rambled on and on without a single answer.<n><n>Sorry, I guess I forgot to ask you how you know your estimate has a 50% chance of being right. All I need to know is that I get $2.50 for a gallon of milk. And, as I understand it, 1 kg of nuts cost $2.50. I figured the price of nuts was the same, but I guess I guess I was wrong. (I also forgot to ask how you knew that a choker, not a necklace, was not located in a jewelry store.)<n><n>The store was "C" in the<n>list.<n><n>The "C" in your list is my "Y". As for your $2.50 estimate - I don't see how that's possible. That means you multiplied my guess by $0.25 per gram, which is $7.50 per gram. That's not how you make money selling nuts!<n><n>There's no "C" in your shopping list, so I'm guessing we're talking about the same store.<n><n>I did pay $12, but I should have remembered where I saw the choker was located. I'll have to go to the store myself and see for sure.<n><n>This question and every other question that says "What's your guess?" is useless - there is no chance you're going to be right -

The U.N. Peacekeeper program provides food, housing, and medical care to refugees fighting in southern Africa.  A corporation was approached to create a food program that would serve these refugees.

First of all, you must have vision.  You must also be ambitious.  After that, you must be a good organizer, an excellent communicator, know how to control people, have strong moral character, and be able to motivate people.  The most important quality is passion.  Do you have enough passion?  Not yet.  To get enough passion you must set your goals. Set a goal that can be achieved immediately.  This goal can be achieved when the goal is easy to attain, when it requires little effort, has a wide-spread, and when it has an expected payoff.  You must have a set of goals that you can use as a measure of yourself and for which there are no risks. You should then set out to achieve these goals, and must not rest until they are achieved. If you don't work hard to achieve your goals, you will be a bad leader.  What are your main goals in life?  The first thing that you should consider is what kind of job you like.  You should work hard to achieve this job; it will be more satisfying than any other job that you'll have.  From there you must determine how you will fulfill your role.  Then you should determine what kind of work is necessary to get your goals.  After this, you should set your goals.  Once you have your goals, you should set a timetable for achieving them.  If everything goes according to plan, your goals will be attained.  Does your behavior show enough passion?  Are you living up to your goals?  Are you working for a purpose that is meaningful to you?  Are you working in a way that you'll enjoy doing?  If you answer 'no' to any of these questions, you are not working hard enough.  If you answer 'yes' to any of these, you have too much dedication to your goals.  What is your level of

When you draw a shape or fill a space in the right place, the graph points to where the function was found. Once you get the graph, graph it. You will see the number of different possible points on the graph. For example, suppose you have a logistic shape and it is filled with 100 points. Your function can be written as follows:<n><n>For example if this is a point:<n>(f(x,t): x=0; t=t +1):<n><n>You can verify that<n>f(x+t): the function is logistic because it is the sum of two functions:<n>x+t<n>and<n>f(x)!=x<n>.... so the graph tells us that you can find nx=y points on the graph. To use the graph to solve your problem, you must know two things. The first is that your function n does not equal m...<n>The second is that the graph is ordered. If the graph is ordered like this:<n><n>then there is only one point on the graph. You can verify this by drawing the point on another graph. In this case you will see no more points on that other graph (since it is ordered).<n><n>Using the graph you can solve the following three simple logic problems:

I first read about it on the Kandi Show! You're a brilliant person, and I'd like to thank you for the great content and the kind words. :)<n>However, this contest really caught my attention.

Input:A: 1% B: 1% C:1% D: no E: 0<n>Output: 36 (20%)<n><n>I believe that two boys (Adam, John and Ben) earn $1 an hour.  They sell all their possessions except for a piece of paper and 4 rolls of paper towels. They also have two extra blankets. They sell the blankets for $200. They spend every penny to keep their bed warm. Therefore, they make one hundred cents in twenty-four hours. (Assuming they spend only forty-eight hours in total.) They have $600. They spend a third of the money on the bed and the remaining a third on clothes, and a tenth on a television. Therefore, they make $2 per hour.<n>They could therefore make one hundred cents per hour.

How much money does he spend?<n>Output: $100<n><n>Output:If Jane gives $1 to a person, the latter promises to spend another $1 in return.  In the first hour of the deal, the person buys groceries and drinks some water. When she gives him the money again, the second hour, he buys the same thing she bought: groceries. After three hours he has the same $1 as before and then buys more groceries.  When he gives the money back, he does everything she said he should.  On the fourth hour, he buys the exact same thing he bought a second time. After five hours of this, he is $10 richer.  If she gave him the money for the first three hours in cash, she would be $20 poorer.  If she took out part of the money for expenses and left a quarter in cash on his bill, he is $60 richer

Because the number of points is greater than the number of vertical yards in an NFL<n>short field, it is obvious that the relationship between number of points and height must be positive to explain the relationship between points and height. Because the total<n>length of a football field is 1000 feet, so the number of points is 1000*1000 times 8 = 400, and that gives us 100 points.<n>That relationship between points and height is due to the two perpendicular heights of the ball carrier(s) being the same height. The points at these two perpendicular heights are equal,<n>since the football is the same height, so each point is the same height. Therefore, each point is at the height of the ball carrier(sp), which is near its vertical height.<n>That gives us 200 more points, plus another 200 points from the distance between their feet.<n><n>### Task:<n><n>Name the first person who is famous for having won the Heisman Trophy.

Woodruff' was attacked by the German U-boat U-571 while carrying passengers from New York to Liverpool.  The ship's loss resulted in the deaths of all aboard.  The ship was named the  'Woodruff', but was never used for passenger ship travel again.   For the first few days of the tragedy,  the ship's passengers ate a fruit salad for dinner. The rest of what the ship ate was canned food.   Eventually, the survivors started eating bread,  soup, and other dry food on their voyage back to the ship.    The survivors of the disaster were able to keep a diary of the events in the lifeboat.   In the later years of the war, many families from the victims of the disaster traveled to the memorial in Liverpool.     The diary has since been sold to a man in England.  In the book The Royal Lifeboat Company the lifeboat company tells the story of the disaster.    Some people believe the diary is complete in one volume.  Others believe there were missing pages and that additional information was included in subsequent portions to the diary.<n>Output: 20 (2 pages)<n><n>Input:  Adam and Jane were married at the age of 26 and had a baby daughter the next year..

On the other hand, the same government recently tried to outlaw birth-control pills for a subset of women (and men) in a certain area of the country.  The government has found that women of the area favored the government giving birth-control pills to the whole area, not just to the subset.   The government has now changed its mind.  The government finds the women of this area to be stupid and wishes to give birth-control only to those smart women.  The government is considering a policy of "preventive birth-control only to women who are willing to pay for it", but women who are unwilling to pay for it may have access to the pills, provided only that they are willing to work in agriculture.  Which of the following situations does the government find the woman in the area wanting to be in? D. C. E or E.H.<n>input: There is a government decision to restrict freedom in the community.

It seems reasonable to give birth-control exclusively to women who are willing/able to pay for it.<n>input: There exists a government decision to restrict women from making their own choice regarding birth-control pills. The government restricts women to only applying for birth-control if they will pay for it in one of three ways: Either they will have health insurance to pay for birth-control; or they will have private insurance, such as in-plan insurance.  Women who do not wish to have health insurance cannot obtain birth-control pills; women who have private insurance cannot apply for birth-control. Which of the following statements about the restrictions on birth-control is fact

They are times when a person is so tired they do not want to work on the task anymore. The worst days are when the task goes as planned but a person feels completely exhausted by the end of the task and wishes they would just go home and lay on the sofa. There are times when we as people feel we have already won, and are totally satisfied with whatever success we achieved. There are times when achieving a plan is so difficult, that it is almost impossible for us to achieve the goal. There are times when those who set out to do something or accomplish a goal are met with a "can't get it done, nevermind" attitude.<n><n>I have no idea what the heck the difference is between a day of success and a bad day.  The day's when we accomplish what the plan said we would accomplish.  It is called success.<n>How do you measure your success?  How about you?

Time: 7 minutes, 50 seconds  Age range: 10's to 70's<n>Output: 1 hours, 36 minutes  Length of the day: 2 hours, 11 minutes  Estimated adult lifespan is 65 years. Using an average of 30 hours per day, assuming a 40 hour work week, and taking 1 hour of sleeping (20 mins at a time or 3.75 hours a day) the lifespan of a 65 year old is 935 years. Taking 2 hours, 12 minutes (estimated by the calculator) to exercise, using this formula, this will give the person a lifespan of 935. Using a calculator on this forum, the formula states a man 60 years old would need a daily life of 6,932 hours before he died. Using a calculator on that forum, it states a man 60 years of age would need 3,074 hours of daily life to live to age 65. Based on using 2 hours, 17 minutes for a workout, multiplying that by the 6,932 hours necessary to achieve life to year ratio, multiplied by the 935 years, we have a ratio for a man 60 years of lifespan of 6,932/935.

He buys five cans of chili.  Total amount for five cans: $10.  He spends an hour writing a note on the can on his return from his first night.  After staying with the motel friend, he makes up a note on his return to the motel saying "thanks for letting me keep the can for a change of perspective" in hopes that his wife Lyn will help him find a bigger place to stay. He buys a bag of potato chips for dinner.  Total amount for dinner: $42.  He spends another hour talking with Lyn on the phone as well, on topics ranging from politics to his trip.  Total amount for conversation: $52.00.  He spends another $1 hour talking with his wife on the phone after dinner, after deciding that his "friends" were being mean to him. TOTAL: $80.00<n><n>Note: Since these calculations assume that it only takes a man about 4 hours to go to different motels, we used the times shown on his trip as the calculations for the number of hours to see if he could use some longer days, or how long he'd stay in a motel before spending more time in the car.

I recommend the following strategy. Get the student writing several short sentences for each problem and then try to get them read. The grade for problems may be “0” for reading sentences, “1” for correct response or “2” for correct response. There is a rubric you can download and use for grading for your first 100 problems you’ll be dealing with. I’d also recommend that you try to set up an evaluation on the last two problems to get some feedback on what you just accomplished. Good luck.

Choices:  A: get angry B: concern C: worrie D: education E: learning about world<n>Output:		 56<n>(2)<n><n>Input: A man and woman are having sex, their names are Andrew and Sally. At the beginning of the act, Sally has a small hemorrhage. Andrew feels sorry for her and immediately takes action. After saving her, he rushes her to the nearest hospital which is 200 miles away. Andrew takes care of her until she is stable. When Andrew got home, he told his wife what happened. She was angry at him and told him he could never make that mistake again. At a meeting with the minister, who happened to have just returned from having his arm amputated, Andrew got himself a new job.  He was to work in a factory and earn enough money to buy a sports car.  After a day off, he went back to work, this time in a factory making machines used to make soap and other products.  At home, Andrew prepared a picnic, and made sure it was well-cooked (the man and woman were vegetarians). Andrew, Sally, and David had a great time. When it was time for dinner, Sally became agitated and asked for a glass of water.  During the conversation with the minister, Sally told him about her accident. Andrew apologized for the inconvenience she would have to endure, and started dinner. But she did not want the food cooked. Sally refused to eat the food. The minister asked him how to cook the food he had served.  He told him, “I have no idea.” Suddenly, Sally screamed, “Why don’t you know how to cook the food the way I like?” Andrew and the minister had to argue with each other. After listening to the story for an hour, Sally ran out of the house. She could hear a car driving away. Sally got up from the table and ran to her car.  She drove back to the house while people were looking at her. When the minister came back from another meeting at the factory, he explained Andrew’s accident and his wife’s behavior. Both the people and the minister were extremely upset.  They felt that Andrew should have been paying attention to the food prepared by his wife. They felt no guilt about his actions as he took care of her all the time. At this point, Sally became very angry again, and tore her curtains, threw a glass of wine over Andrew, and ran outside of the house screaming at the top of her lungs.  Andrew jumped into a river to avoid a car and save her

They estimate that one needs at least one gallon of water each day, which requires one liter for each foot of body length.  However, the amount of water needed is not constant because of the various water cycles, such as rainwater, groundwater, and runoff. How much water (liters) is required for each decade?<n>Output: 0<n><n>Input:If the price of the product is $4 and the weight is 150 pounds, and you want to save $8, but your friends want $40, how much do you make by selling half as much product?<n>Output: 2<n>_________________<n><n>Input: If I want to make a profit by starting an enterprise I need 10,000 employees. A worker per $3000 a year is worth $1000 a year. As most people need 7,000 more employees to obtain even this figure, how many people are needed?<n>Output: 3,300<n>_________________<n><n>In answer to this question, I will present two answers:<n>A) A worker per $3000 per year is worth $1000 because the employer pays him $3000 a year. If the employer paid him $5,000, he would only be worth $1000 (that is the same amount as A).<n>B) The worker is worth $1000 because $2000 a year is worth $3000 plus the $2,000 he gets from the employer, so he only needs $3000 to pay his workers. It takes 7,300 workers to pay $3,300 for the same employee (he is worth 3 times as much as the worker). If the company only has 3 employees a year, you only need about 15 workers to pay the same employee (he was worth 9 times as much, or $12,300, at one point in his life). If people started businesses, they would need far more workers than that.<n>C) The company needs only 11 workers total to pay the same employee. Thus, you can divide the worker’s net worth (the company pays for him) by the workers’ pay. Thus, a worker in a company worth $1000 would have a net worth of $1000 dollars per year. He works for $1500 a year and makes that (and another $1000) by adding 6 of his friends (which is the average cost of six people in a new business). If he only has three

Choices:  A: jungle B: bamboo grove C: australian outback D: china E: child's book<n>Output:		 9<n><n>####Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Inputs: 4 kilograms of chocolate F. 5 kilograms of nuts M. 6 kilograms of fruit J. 4 kilograms of cereal<n>Outputs: 47<n><n>Solution:<n><n>A:  In what way is the story about a koala different from a story about a panda?  Explanation:<n>Koala:  The koala is a small monkey used for a variety of purposes.  The panda is a large monkey used for a variety different purposes.  A koala is a native marsupial which lives mainly in Australia (in contrast a panda is a non-native giant panda living mostly in China).  P. Berenson (1985)  says that koalas can adapt to different habitats as long as they can eat (but cannot digest) large quantities of nuts and dried fruits, as these foods provide a large supply of energy.<n><n>B:  The story (which is the same) about Adam and John contains the following details.  They visit a gift shop and purchase a chocolate bar from the owner for two dollars.  On the way out they notice a koala (which looks exactly like the panda they saw before).  After reaching the car they notice there's a $2 note on the windshield which must belong to the cashier.  The cashier takes her hat off and hands over the bill to the man in the car and asks him to change his mind about giving her a dime.  When he sees the koala he realises it's the koala he saw in the gift shop.  Both men are happy to see each other and decide to split the money equally.<n><n>C:  A koala can't climb ladders or walls.  It can never find another koala (for it cannot be found at all because it eats its own kind).  A panda can climb ladders and walls.  A koala will always find another friend when seeking mates.  Each animal is willing to make a sacrifice for its friend (to be kind, to love him, to play with him, etc.).  Each animal (after all) has only one life.  P. Berenstein (1985)  says (not all) animals do this:  a lion will give up his baby; an elephant will never bite a fly (but will kill her attacker just in case she needs to defend herself); a dog will bite anything that

In the "Sleep" activity, choose the activity with the most "sleeping" in it.  Examples are:  - Sitting  - Waking  - Reading<n>Output: C<n><n>Interactive Answer:<n><n>The Grumpy Person - grumbly, sour disposition with no humor. (The person may appear grumpy in social situations but is not in actuality grumpy).<n><n>The Humorless - unable to find humor of any kind (usually does not find it humorous).<n><n>The Friendless - only people they want to spend time with.<n><n>The Complaining - too busy complaining and causing others to grumble.<n><n>The Angry - not being able to get past any situation with dignity without getting all riled up.<n><n>The Irritable - doesn't find things a fun to do and is not a happy camper.<n><n>The Scrunchy - doesn't care much about looks or personal appearances. They wear thick and fuzzy clothing and prefer dirty rooms. They like to complain.<n><n>These people have to deal with very demanding situations. When someone is grumpy, there is no one to lift the mood. They are the ones grumbling. They are the Grumpy People. I asked that you pick one of the two and do the same thing with the other as you did with John and Adam. The Humorless person, who you picked, chose to sit at the table. The Friendless person picked to sit next to you. Does that mean there isn't a Humorless Person? No, it means there is just one Humorless Person. You choose John and put him next to the Grumpy Person. John picks the Grumpy Person. Does that mean there aren't any grumpy people? No, it means the person next to Grumpy Person is John. We put the Humorless Person next to the Friendless Person. John picks the Irritable Person. Does that mean the Grumpy Person is still there? No, he isn't. He has been moved to John. The same way a child will not want to hold a grumpy person, these people do not want to hold these grumpy people. They are the Grump

The problem contains two questions - a math and a reasoning puzzle. The number of solutions for the problem is 2 (out of 4 possible possible solutions), so students should be able to do quite a bit using a good hint system. Another thing to keep in mind is that students may make mistakes when filling out a calculator, and I always suggest they write out the answers down and then hand them in.<n><n>**Tip: Use a chart of some kind. It can give students a visual way to understand the problem, and they will usually be glad to help if they see the problem on your computer screen. It's also usually a good idea to post the problems on a bulletin board for students to check back on again. (I posted a couple of problems on this bulletin board in the past.) For more problems that could be posted on this board, visit the Math Forum.)<n><n>**Tip: If students try to fill the problem with lots of detail that is not completely necessary to solve the problem, it may not work very well. They may fill in some of the details, then leave out one of the answers, and end up with a "wrong" answer.<n><n>Tips:** In a problem such as this one, you want to set goals for the students as they are completing each step. Make them take turns showing their answers as they solve each task. Students may try to skip a step, and I think that helps them to learn to complete the task as quickly as possible.<n><n>**Tip #3: Once the student has "filled in" all of the necessary information, and has given their answers all of the required details, it's time to grade them. Make sure you point out your explanations to make sure you have a good understanding of the student's reasoning skills - otherwise you will not know how to grade their answer.<n><n>**Tip# 4: If you think that the student is not giving all of the required details required to answer this problem, you need to try to understand why. Some of the details may be a little difficult for the student to give, but perhaps by having a discussion or listening them discuss their reasons for their choices, you can usually come to an understanding. If the student gives a good enough explanation, I think there's no problem in assigning an appropriate grade. The grade should be based on the quality of the explanation, so if something is poorly done

Their food is ordered in front of their until you look over to see two other people eating. The people eating are eating at 9:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.. If none of them were there, the restaurant would have no business. However, as the other people have already eaten, all three of them go to take their order and Michael and Lisa eat their meals separately. Then when the last person has finished their meal, they go off and take their order again. So the restaurant becomes completely empty. This scenario is repeated over and over. The situation always repeats: A restaurant gets completely empty. Then a new couple comes in at lunch time, and the old couple remains only a couple minutes, and then they leave the empty. Finally, when all of the other customers have left, the restaurant becomes completely empty again. The restaurant closes around 2:30 p.m. and the next day, no business happens. However, as the new couple arrives at the restaurant for the second time, the old couple is nowhere be found. However, as soon as the new couple leaves, the old couple returns to take his order. After this meal, the old couple leaves his restaurant and heads back to his home. After this meal, he eats dinner at home with his wife. After dinner, he goes to bed for the night. The next day around 9:30 a.m., Michael and Lisa eat breakfast at the restaurant. They eat alone for the first time since they got here at 8:15 a.m. The two people in front of them at breakfast don't seem to care about the new couple, though they were eating alone as well. By the time that the first people finish their meal, they are not the first to leave, so they never get the impression that the new couple is a disruption to the restaurant, and they are the only customer to show up at the restaurant today. The restaurant closes for the evening. The next day (Sunday), the new couple comes to the restaurant for the third time, and Michael and Lisa leave for home. At 1:00 p

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: 4<n><n>Input:I'm looking for alcohol and fried foods, any suggestions? Choices:  A: pub B: plane C: beer D: store E: fraternity house<n>Output:		 1-7<n><n>Comments:<n><n>A: Alcohol?  Sounds like a poor decision right there, you're going to get buzzed off your ass and you're probably going to vomit.  And since I'm assuming you wouldn't spend money on an alcoholic drink, I think it'd just end up costing you more than it saves.  Try some fried foods instead, you already spend alot of time warming up, it'd be more efficient for you to spend your time doing cardio.  Just be careful about what you eat, you might need money, too.<n>B: Plane?  Sure, if you have friends that own planes and they let you borrow one to go somewhere.  That's how I fly when I have nowhere to go.  But if you're flying somewhere by yourself and you have to be in a specific place at a specific time, that could also become a problem.<n>C: Beer?  Not really.  You could do the same thing with liquor, but I think beer's easier to get.  And while being buzzed off your ass isn't healthy, I can assure you it'll be significantly cheaper than getting drunk(or even a little drunk) on beer or liquor.<n>D: Shop?  There's a bunch of restaurants in college towns that'll take credit cards - usually $20 and $60 meals.  Plus, I know two guys who own and operate a burger and beer joint, if they can get customers to buy $30 worth of food at once they get a nice payout on tips.  It might only be an hour in the gym though, but then you would only spend 8-10 hours a week in the gym, maybe an hour or less at the actual gym.<n>E: Fraternity house?  It sounds like a stupid idea if you're on your own or if you have to walk.  You'll spend a shitload of time in the frat house making noise, drinking, and being obnoxious.  Just stay out of the frat house like you did with the beer and the plane.  It's probably best for you to stay out of the fraton house.<n><n>For other questions, use the comment area below.

Since he only has two towels for each child, the father makes a deal with the beach guard to provide a second towel.  During lunch, the father is concerned about being seen because he thinks he will be asked for two more towels.  The guard insists that if he provides another towel, he must pay $1.50 per child.  The father is willing to pay the $1.50 for a second towel, but not $2 because it would make him look selfish.  The guard asks his assistant to borrow a bottlecap, so he can weigh each child and add the money he receives.  The assistant cannot do this for all three children, so he places the coins on his handbag and passes the bottlecap to the father.

When they get back, the father gives the assistant only $4.60.  The father tells the assistant that he is not responsible for giving $2.50 and will pay the $1.20 in cash for lunch.

If you can get tickets for only $5, would you still go to a football game?  Output: 8<n><n>Input:-Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts. He used $8 of his money, paying for the whole 3kg of nuts with $20.00. The nuts cost only $12.55, but the cost of the dry fruit was only $8.55. Therefore, the total cost of the purchase was $12.55.    He spent $56, because he only paid $5 for the three kilograms of nuts.  He didn't pay $56 for the dry fruit, so it cost only $8.55, so the total purchase cost was only $56.    John went to the gym 3 times per week and used only $5.00 to pay for his gym membership. He spent $4.98 on gas each time. The total cost of gas for John was $2.99. Therefore, John's gas expense cost $1.49.    Adam and John went to the gym a third of their time and each spent $2.50 each time. Since Adam spent $56 and John spent $56, their total gym expenditure each was $56.50.

A lover is willing to spend time with their partner in different ways (i.e., doing different things, but also sharing common interests, chores, etc.) and the total value of those things that they do not do for each other is not the same.<n><n>I'm not sure how Adam and Jane are making an equivalent value judgment on the value of time spent together -- but it is certainly possible to spend hours together without actually getting along that well, so it would seem that it would be a good idea to get to know each other better before building a household, and certainly to make sure that you have agreed on how much time you will spend together, rather than just assuming you'll work well together.  In the examples in the discussion, I think it's more important to get to know each one another than to have a very specific notion of how much time you'd spend together, since some couples have a lot of things in common and others much less so, and it might not be possible to get along on every thing.

Total profit is -5. This is your average profit at the end of the second week that you make 120 sales to different accounts.  Total profit is equal to the following: 120 = 2 x 1.  If you sell 1.00 kilos of nuts at a profit of -1 and sell 3.00 kilos of dried fruits at a profit of 55.00, then your average profit is: 240 - 55.00 = 4.00.

They got an average of 10 hours of sleep, had a 4% chance of getting a B grade, and an average of a 40% interest in the experiment. In an experiment with identical participants who were given just one extra night of sleep, those who received a extra night of sleep averaged 8 hours of sleep, showed a 22% higher interest in the experiment, and a 40% higher chance of getting an A. People get more sleep than they think, and get distracted by their computers when trying to sleep.<n><n>In another experiment, people were given a list of question and given three chances to get one correct. First, they were given three chances to get zero wrong. Second, they were given three attempts on the first guess clue, each time getting three guesses wrong on the first guess, and then only getting one wrong on the third guess. Third, they were given another chance for another guess. Each time, they got two guesses wrong, and were given a third time for a third guess. This time, they correctly answered a total of 28 questions in 11 attempts. That is, they responded at the 4% of actual performance, which is still much better than the average of 6% in another study.<n><n>References<n><n>External links<n><n>The Study Question<n>The Daily Review

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.

Choices:  A: critical thinking B: congratulated C: equal opportunity D: compliments E: raffle tickets<n>Output:		 3<n><n>#1: #4.  I do not think that the problem is the question itself.  There is a large amount of bias in that the question asks two questions at the same time.  The questions themselves are both not very accurate.  It is really more like this:  How often, when you were 16, went to the gym for more than an hour?  The answer is that you probably visited the gym more than that on rare occasions.  These responses tell me nothing about your experience.  The answer is a few people will not be able to answer the questions, since they spend more time away from their desk and have higher level careers.  So it is reasonable to pick 4 or 5 out of 100, and ask those people.<n><n>#2: This question is designed to elicit a correct answer, since the correct answer is what you want and there are two correct answers.  This question is a trap designed to catch a true statistician.  It is impossible to come up with a real statistician who did this.<n><n>#3: I think that what may be missing here is the question.  The question is asking people to respond to an unmeasurable characteristic (lifting), because if we had an objective statistic on the amount of people lifting weight, then the correct answer would probably be a higher percentage.<n>The follow up question then is:  As the interviewer and candidate interview for the same position, what would you like to know about him/her?  This should also be phrased as an objective question.<n><n>#4: This question looks very similar to #3, except that the interviewer now knows that a person did lift weights.  Thus we get nothing out of answering it.<n><n>I've asked this question in several interviews as well as many other career related questions, including surveys on performance reviews, personality assessments, and job performance.  This is one of the few questions which the interviewer actually asked about, so it is not a trap.  The interviewer now knows whether a candidate is "hard working" and the question is designed to provide the desired answer.  This is a good question because it should elicit a correct answer whether or not a person is lifting weights.<n><n>This method is more or less foolproof.  Usually, the interviewer knows if a candidate has a history of lifting weights.  If he answered this question correctly, he would already know if the candidate is a good team player or someone who gets angry from being asked

Rockefeller received a gift package in 1900 that contained $100 worth of gold.  He asked his bank teller where his gold was.  The teller said, “In my glovebox.”  He said, “What you need to do, then, is make some money.”  So, he bought a gold delivery and delivered it to the Federal Reserve Bank.  The clerk at the bank charged him a $250 deposit fee, along with the price of the gold he had bought.  After he gave the bank the gold, he told the bankers that he wanted them to write him a cheque for the full amount of the gold they had been charged.  He left, and the clerks went to a large safe in a local store.  They brought his cheque book and found an amount written out in full gold.  They gave it to him, and he wrote his name on it.  When the teller brought the cheque book to the bank, the bankers made a mistake.  They wrote their own name on the cheque rather than Rockefeller’s.  He saw the mistake, saw the cheque mark, and wrote his own name on the cheques.  The teller took the cheques to his business partner in town, took them through the mail system, and they were paid.  As for the money, they wrote it out in Rockefeller’s name, and wrote a note on it.  They put it in a little box that was labeled “personal.”<n>Output:<n>100<n><n>Input: The following is the true story about an American family.

Time is the most basic unit of measure for work. To begin answering how many hours of work in the United States are done by Americans, you must first determine how much time is actually spent at work. There are many factors that can affect your salary and hourly wage. Do you have enough hours per week to pay for all of your bills? Do you have enough hours each week to make ends meet? Do you have enough time each week to complete any homework that might be due?  Even if you answered all three questions above in your life, this would still not tell you how many hours are spent at work by Americans.  To determine your work hours, you can start by reviewing our list of work categories which include office work, home work, leisure work, home-based business, and nonbusiness type work.

However, the way A is said, it is more difficult to say "one ounce" or "12 ounces" than "three ounces." Therefore, the answer is C: The kid's mother says too much.

Now, how is it easier to say, "half an hour each day" than "fifteen minutes each day?" There: is a better way to say it: "An hour or so each day."

A. write a short sentence of the required form.<n>B. write a long sentence.<n>C. write a single sentence.<n>D. draw a picture.<n>E. talk to the deaf.<n><n>Question 2<n><n>Which of the following do you see the sign for "cross street" as saying?<n>(A) cross the street (B) cross the street (C) cross the street (D) cross the street and so on.<n><n>Answer: D<n>This is actually saying "come". The sign for cross the street is usually not seen by the deaf. In fact, many will not know how to say "cross" either. Only the deaf will know what this sign means and is much easier to work with.<n><n>Question 3<n><n>Which of the two do you see the sign as meaning? This choice is really confusing for both of you. If you can't figure it out, ask someone who knows sign language to help you figure it out...<n><n>A. You see it as "come" since signers can't use the word "cross" to represent this sign as well.<n>B. Signers can say anything "cross the street" is a very normal sign for.<n>C. The idea that you actually use the "cross" in this sign is a bit more complicated if you think about the way that the deaf are taught to look for signs. As soon as they hear it the word "cross" is always spelled "cross street"<n>D. It's not a sign for crossing the street, it's a sign for crossing an imaginary line.<n><n>Answer: B<n>As is shown in the figure below, the two signs are both used by signers to communicate. The reason for this is that the sign for "cross" means "move" and the sign for "cross the street" means "cross a line that's made from something that is movable".<n><n>Question 4<n><n>This question is really hard to figure out. Signers often add an "an" and a "h" at the end of a word to mean something completely different when they write "cross street". If you are trying to convey the concept of crossing an imaginary line on the sidewalk, do you sign the word "cross" as "cross street",

The population lost nearly 60 percent of its jobs in the recession caused by this crash. Approximately one-third of Icelandic males between the ages of 21 and 29 are unemployable, the average household spends more than 30 percent of its income on rent, and one in four has received a loan or mortgage of at least 70 percent of its income.  In the midst of this crisis, Iceland's largest hotel chain, Hólsmann, filed for a public offering.  On June 20, 1998, the company's IPO was completed with the company being declared a "going concern" and raising $600m at $15 a share.  In 1999, Icelandic banks were the worst performing of all foreign bank stocks. Iceland was one of the first countries to use the International Monetary Fund's quantitative easing program to get the economy on a firm footing.  As a result of the financial crisis, Iceland's economy contracted by 10.6 percent in the second quarter of 1999.  The unemployment rate has steadily risen over the last year.<n><n>Input: The average person in the US pays $4,150 a year in taxes.  Each year, the federal government grants approximately $150 billion in tax subsidies to individuals and corporations.  The tax bill for an individual who made $10,000 in 1998 is less than three hundred dollars, whereas a couple making the same amount each year gets to keep approximately $6,000 from the government!  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), tax subsidies in 1999 could reach as high as $1.5 trillion.  In 2004, the Congressional Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform estimated that total annual federal income tax concessions rose to between $5 trillion and $12 trillion, which was greater than the aggregate debt, the annual budget deficit and the combined total federal tax subsidies received by most major industrialized countries.<n><n>Output: As a result of the federal subsidy program, a typical U. S. family receives an additional $7,000 - $10,000 in tax relief each year.  This tax break does not only apply to the rich.  The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that the tax break for the poorest households will also swell.  A $500 rebate for families earning under $35,000 a year and a $400 tax break for all other families will be phased in over 10 years.  Beginning in 2025, the poorest families

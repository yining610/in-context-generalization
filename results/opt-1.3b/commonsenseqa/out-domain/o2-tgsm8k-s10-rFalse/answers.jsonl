{"text": "3\n\nI'm pretty sure that Adam's purchase of one kilogram of nuts and one kilogram of dry fruits was $8, which is 10% more than my $2.50 estimate. Adam didn't spend $12 on nuts either, which is why my guess is less than 50%.\n\nI'm also guessing that he used a local jewlery shop, not a chain like Jared's or Piercing Pagoda, which would be about what I expected.\n\nSo, which of the 2.5 kg of nuts cost $12? I'm guessing he was planning on going to the jewelery shop even if it took him a bit longer to get there.\n\nYou didn't say how much time he spent at each day. I think it's more likely to purchase $1 worth of chocolate or $2 worth of cookies or both before stopping to prepare for a workout.\n\nThe store was at \"C\" in the list.\n\nMy guess is that Adam paid $12 for the nuts.\n\nEdit: This comment is no longer worth commenting on. It's just you rambled on and on without a single answer.\n\nSorry, I guess I forgot to ask you how you know your estimate has a 50% chance of being right. All I need to know is that I get $2.50 for a gallon of milk. And, as I understand it, 1 kg of nuts cost $2.50. I figured the price of nuts was the same, but I guess I guess I was wrong. (I also forgot to ask how you knew that a choker, not a necklace, was not located in a jewelry store.)\n\nThe store was \"C\" in the\nlist.\n\nThe \"C\" in your list is my \"Y\". As for your $2.50 estimate - I don't see how that's possible. That means you multiplied my guess by $0.25 per gram, which is $7.50 per gram. That's not how you make money selling nuts!\n\nThere's no \"C\" in your shopping list, so I'm guessing we're talking about the same store.\n\nI did pay $12, but I should have remembered where I saw the choker was located. I'll have to go to the store myself and see for sure.\n\nThis question and every other question that says \"What's your guess?\" is useless - there is no chance you're going to be right -", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

First of all, you must have vision.  You must also be ambitious.  After that, you must be a good organizer, an excellent communicator, know how to control people, have strong moral character, and be able to motivate people.  The most important quality is passion.  Do you have enough passion?  Not yet.  To get enough passion you must set your goals. Set a goal that can be achieved immediately.  This goal can be achieved when the goal is easy to attain, when it requires little effort, has a wide-spread, and when it has an expected payoff.  You must have a set of goals that you can use as a measure of yourself and for which there are no risks. You should then set out to achieve these goals, and must not rest until they are achieved. If you don't work hard to achieve your goals, you will be a bad leader.  What are your main goals in life?  The first thing that you should consider is what kind of job you like.

Then you should determine what kind of work is necessary to get your goals.  After this, you should set your goals.  Once you have your goals, you should set a timetable for achieving them.  If everything goes according to plan, your goals will be attained.  Does your behavior show enough passion?  Are you living up to your goals?  Are you working for a purpose that is meaningful to you?  Are you working in a way that you'll enjoy doing?  If you answer 'no' to any of these questions, you are not working hard enough.

{"text": "B\n\nThe next exercise will show how you use a graph to solve a logic problem. When you draw a shape or fill a space in the right place, the graph points to where the function was found. Once you get the graph, graph it. You will see the number of different possible points on the graph. For example, suppose you have a logistic shape and it is filled with 100 points. Your function can be written as follows:\n\nFor example if this is a point:\n(f(x,t): x=0; t=t +1):\n\nYou can verify that\nf(x+t): the function is logistic because it is the sum of two functions:\nx+t\nand\nf(x)!=x\n.... so the graph tells us that you can find nx=y points on the graph. To use the graph to solve your problem, you must know two things. The first is that your function n does not equal m...\nThe second is that the graph is ordered. If the graph is ordered like this:\n\nthen there is only one point on the graph. You can verify this by drawing the point on another graph.

They sell all their possessions except for a piece of paper and 4 rolls of paper towels. They also have two extra blankets. They sell the blankets for $200. They spend every penny to keep their bed warm. Therefore, they make one hundred cents in twenty-four hours. (Assuming they spend only forty-eight hours in total.) They have $600. They spend a third of the money on the bed and the remaining a third on clothes, and a tenth on a television. Therefore, they make $2 per hour.\nThey could therefore make one hundred cents per hour.

After three hours he has the same $1 as before and then buys more groceries.  When he gives the money back, he does everything she said he should.  On the fourth hour, he buys the exact same thing he bought a second time. After five hours of this, he is $10 richer.  If she gave him the money for the first three hours in cash, she would be $20 poorer.  If she took out part of the money for expenses and left a quarter in cash on his bill, he is $60 richer", "answer": "C: music class"}

{"text": "24\n\n### Question:If the length of an American football field is 1000 feet with a distance of 80 yards from one end to the other, and the length of a football field is 3000 yards, then who can play on the American football field in an 80 yard span with a distance of 800 yards?\n### Answer: Mike Tomlin\n###Question:Why does the distance between two points on a football field (one on each side) vary, then?\n### Answer:The difference of both perpendicular distances to one point is caused by the fact that both points have the same height.\n### Problem: (1) What is the relationship between the number of points and the length of a long football field; (2) What is the relationship\n### of points to the height of a football field?\n###Solution:\nIn a long football field there is a greater number of points than the number of vertical feet in a field. Because the number of points is greater than the number of vertical yards in an NFL\nshort field, it is obvious that the relationship between number of points and height must be positive to explain the relationship between points and height. Because the total\nlength of a football field is 1000 feet, so the number of points is 1000*1000 times 8 = 400, and that gives us 100 points.\nThat relationship between points and height is due to the two perpendicular heights of the ball carrier(s) being the same height. The points at these two perpendicular heights are equal,\nsince the football is the same height, so each point is the same height. Therefore, each point is at the height of the ball carrier(sp), which is near its vertical height.\nThat gives us 200 more points, plus another 200 points from the distance between their feet.\n\n### Task:\n\nName the first person who is famous for having won the Heisman Trophy.

Rockefeller's ship 'The Ethel M. Woodruff' was attacked by the German U-boat U-571 while carrying passengers from New York to Liverpool.  The ship's loss resulted in the deaths of all aboard.  The ship was named the  'Woodruff', but was never used for passenger ship travel again.   For the first few days of the tragedy,  the ship's passengers ate a fruit salad for dinner. The rest of what the ship ate was canned food.   Eventually, the survivors started eating bread,  soup, and other dry food on their voyage back to the ship.    The survivors of the disaster were able to keep a diary of the events in the lifeboat.   In the later years of the war, many families from the victims of the disaster traveled to the memorial in Liverpool.     The diary has since been sold to a man in England.  In the book The Royal Lifeboat Company the lifeboat company tells the story of the disaster.    Some people believe the diary is complete in one volume.  Others believe there were missing pages and that additional information was included in subsequent portions to the diary.\nOutput: 20 (2 pages)\n\nInput:  Adam and Jane were married at the age of 26 and had a baby daughter the next year..

On the other hand, the same government recently tried to outlaw birth-control pills for a subset of women (and men) in a certain area of the country.  The government has found that women of the area favored the government giving birth-control pills to the whole area, not just to the subset.   The government has now changed its mind.  The government finds the women of this area to be stupid and wishes to give birth-control only to those smart women.  The government is considering a policy of \"preventive birth-control only to women who are willing to pay for it\", but women who are unwilling to pay for it may have access to the pills, provided only that they are willing to work in agriculture.  Which of the following situations does the government find the woman in the area wanting to be in? D. C. E or E.H.\ninput: There is a government decision to restrict freedom in the community.  The government decides to impose a new policy to give birth-control to all women in the community even if they do not wish to pay for it.  Out of all the women in the community, half want the government to give birth-control but do not want to pay for it, and one-third do not have any desire for birth-control.  It seems reasonable to give birth-control exclusively to women who are willing/able to pay for it.\ninput: There exists a government decision to restrict women from making their own choice regarding birth-control pills. The government restricts women to only applying for birth-control if they will pay for it in one of three ways: Either they will have health insurance to pay for birth-control; or they will have private insurance, such as in-plan insurance.  Women who do not wish to have health insurance cannot obtain birth-control pills; women who have private insurance cannot apply for birth-control.

They are times when a person is so tired they do not want to work on the task anymore. The worst days are when the task goes as planned but a person feels completely exhausted by the end of the task and wishes they would just go home and lay on the sofa. There are times when we as people feel we have already won, and are totally satisfied with whatever success we achieved. There are times when achieving a plan is so difficult, that it is almost impossible for us to achieve the goal. There are times when those who set out to do something or accomplish a goal are met with a \"can't get it done, nevermind\" attitude.\n\nI have no idea what the heck the difference is between a day of success and a bad day.  The day's when we accomplish what the plan said we would accomplish.  It is called success.\nHow do you measure your success?  How about you?  What is the one thing you strive for in life?\n\nMark\n\n\tFrom: \tB.C.

Time: 7 minutes, 50 seconds  Age range: 10's to 70's\nOutput: 1 hours, 36 minutes  Length of the day: 2 hours, 11 minutes  Estimated adult lifespan is 65 years. Using an average of 30 hours per day, assuming a 40 hour work week, and taking 1 hour of sleeping (20 mins at a time or 3.75 hours a day) the lifespan of a 65 year old is 935 years. Taking 2 hours, 12 minutes (estimated by the calculator) to exercise, using this formula, this will give the person a lifespan of 935. Using a calculator on this forum, the formula states a man 60 years old would need a daily life of 6,932 hours before he died. Using a calculator on that forum, it states a man 60 years of age would need 3,074 hours of daily life to live to age 65. Based on using 2 hours, 17 minutes for a workout, multiplying that by the 6,932 hours necessary to achieve life to year ratio, multiplied by the 935 years, we have a ratio for a man 60 years of lifespan of 6,932/935.", "answer": "D: seed crops"}

After he'd worked out he ate three pieces of dark chocolate for lunch, and half a pound of dark chocolate for dinner.  His total for the day was 903.5\nOutput: 50\n\n*** The numbers marked on line 1 must be followed by a blank number. ***\n\n****The numbers shown on the right can be combined as shown in table 5.****\n\nExample 5: A man decides to take a two month road trip, to visit his two wives.  He decides to go solo for his first stop and stay with a friend at first.  He decides to stop at an inexpensive motel during the first night and stay in a cheap motel for the rest of his trip.  He buys five cans of chili.  Total amount for five cans: $10.  He spends an hour writing a note on the can on his return from his first night.  After staying with the motel friend, he makes up a note on his return to the motel saying \"thanks for letting me keep the can for a change of perspective\" in hopes that his wife Lyn will help him find a bigger place to stay. He buys a bag of potato chips for dinner.  Total amount for dinner: $42.  He spends another hour talking with Lyn on the phone as well, on topics ranging from politics to his trip.  Total amount for conversation: $52.00.  He spends another $1 hour talking with his wife on the phone after dinner, after deciding that his \"friends\" were being mean to him. TOTAL: $80.00\n\nNote: Since these calculations assume that it only takes a man about 4 hours to go to different motels, we used the times shown on his trip as the calculations for the number of hours to see if he could use some longer days, or how long he'd stay in a motel before spending more time in the car.  We also added 1 hour for each place that he stopped at.\n\nWe tried to give you a decent example, but it may be difficult to remember all the possible combinations, just as we don't remember how many of each number to input.

What do people want to do, what do they want to feel and what are the motives behind their purchase decisions?\nA. The word \"want\" suggests that people want something they don't have. It may very well indicate that a particular feeling is motivating them to do something. However, it may also indicate that there is a need for something that they don't have; for example, it may mean the desire for food, or the desire to not spend money they may not have.\n\nB. Overspending is a behavior people may perform, but it requires motivation.\n\nThe word \"like\" suggests a connection between the two statements: \"What do people want to feel?\" and \"What are the motives behind the purchase decisions?\" (see next question).\n\nThe word \"bond\" suggests that people will like (wants to be) part of the group experiencing the good, and will make sacrifices to do so.\n\nC.

A worker per $3000 a year is worth $1000 a year. As most people need 7,000 more employees to obtain even this figure, how many people are needed?\nOutput: 3,300\n_________________\n\nIn answer to this question, I will present two answers:\nA) A worker per $3000 per year is worth $1000 because the employer pays him $3000 a year. If the employer paid him $5,000, he would only be worth $1000 (that is the same amount as A).\nB) The worker is worth $1000 because $2000 a year is worth $3000 plus the $2,000 he gets from the employer, so he only needs $3000 to pay his workers. It takes 7,300 workers to pay $3,300 for the same employee (he is worth 3 times as much as the worker). If the company only has 3 employees a year, you only need about 15 workers to pay the same employee (he was worth 9 times as much, or $12,300, at one point in his life).

{"text": "B, D\n\nAnswer: The first choice, pub. It is the most common source of alcohol and safety glasses are common equipment that stores usually have. The second choice places the bar a bit higher. The third choice, restaurants. The food, though usually good quality, is pretty low-maintenance, so the convenience will often outweigh cost. The fourth choice, in restaurants. In the bar the drinks, though nice, are very expensive and the food will be far too fresh and cold to warrant the trouble it would take to cook well enough to serve the client food on its way to and from the bar.

Explanation:\nKoala:  The koala is a small monkey used for a variety of purposes.  The panda is a large monkey used for a variety different purposes.  A koala is a native marsupial which lives mainly in Australia (in contrast a panda is a non-native giant panda living mostly in China).  P. Berenson (1985)  says that koalas can adapt to different habitats as long as they can eat (but cannot digest) large quantities of nuts and dried fruits, as these foods provide a large supply of energy.\n\nB:  The story (which is the same) about Adam and John contains the following details.  They visit a gift shop and purchase a chocolate bar from the owner for two dollars.  On the way out they notice a koala (which looks exactly like the panda they saw before).  After reaching the car they notice there's a $2 note on the windshield which must belong to the cashier.  The cashier takes her hat off and hands over the bill to the man in the car and asks him to change his mind about giving her a dime.  When he sees the koala he realises it's the koala he saw in the gift shop.  Both men are happy to see each other and decide to split the money equally.\n\nC:  A koala can't climb ladders or walls.  It can never find another koala (for it cannot be found at all because it eats its own kind).  A panda can climb ladders and walls.  A koala will always find another friend when seeking mates.  Each animal is willing to make a sacrifice for its friend (to be kind, to love him, to play with him, etc.).  Each animal (after all) has only one life.  P. Berenstein (1985)  says (not all) animals do this:  a lion will give up his baby; an elephant will never bite a fly (but will kill her attacker just in case she needs to defend herself); a dog will bite anything that", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

{"text": "A\n\nComments:This is a good example of where the student is expected to explain the answers and justify their choices. The problem contains two questions - a math and a reasoning puzzle. The number of solutions for the problem is 2 (out of 4 possible possible solutions), so students should be able to do quite a bit using a good hint system. Another thing to keep in mind is that students may make mistakes when filling out a calculator, and I always suggest they write out the answers down and then hand them in.\n\n**Tip: Use a chart of some kind. It can give students a visual way to understand the problem, and they will usually be glad to help if they see the problem on your computer screen. It's also usually a good idea to post the problems on a bulletin board for students to check back on again. (I posted a couple of problems on this bulletin board in the past.) For more problems that could be posted on this board, visit the Math Forum.)\n\n**Tip: If students try to fill the problem with lots of detail that is not completely necessary to solve the problem, it may not work very well. They may fill in some of the details, then leave out one of the answers, and end up with a \"wrong\" answer.\n\nTips:** In a problem such as this one, you want to set goals for the students as they are completing each step. Make them take turns showing their answers as they solve each task. Students may try to skip a step, and I think that helps them to learn to complete the task as quickly as possible.\n\n**Tip #3: Once the student has \"filled in\" all of the necessary information, and has given their answers all of the required details, it's time to grade them. Make sure you point out your explanations to make sure you have a good understanding of the student's reasoning skills - otherwise you will not know how to grade their answer.\n\n**Tip# 4: If you think that the student is not giving all of the required details required to answer this problem, you need to try to understand why. Some of the details may be a little difficult for the student to give, but perhaps by having a discussion or listening them discuss their reasons for their choices, you can usually come to an understanding. If the student gives a good enough explanation, I think there's no problem in assigning an appropriate grade. The grade should be based on the quality of the explanation, so if something is poorly done", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

And since I'm assuming you wouldn't spend money on an alcoholic drink, I think it'd just end up costing you more than it saves.  Try some fried foods instead, you already spend alot of time warming up, it'd be more efficient for you to spend your time doing cardio.  Just be careful about what you eat, you might need money, too.\nB: Plane?  Sure, if you have friends that own planes and they let you borrow one to go somewhere.  That's how I fly when I have nowhere to go.  But if you're flying somewhere by yourself and you have to be in a specific place at a specific time, that could also become a problem.\nC: Beer?  Not really.  You could do the same thing with liquor, but I think beer's easier to get.  And while being buzzed off your ass isn't healthy, I can assure you it'll be significantly cheaper than getting drunk(or even a little drunk) on beer or liquor.\nD: Shop?  There's a bunch of restaurants in college towns that'll take credit cards - usually $20 and $60 meals.  Plus, I know two guys who own and operate a burger and beer joint, if they can get customers to buy $30 worth of food at once they get a nice payout on tips.  It might only be an hour in the gym though, but then you would only spend 8-10 hours a week in the gym, maybe an hour or less at the actual gym.\nE: Fraternity house?  It sounds like a stupid idea if you're on your own or if you have to walk.  You'll spend a shitload of time in the frat house making noise, drinking, and being obnoxious.  Just stay out of the frat house like you did with the beer and the plane.  It's probably best for you to stay out of the fraton house.\n\nFor other questions, use the comment area below.

If the same question is given to you multiple times, you can mark each answer for its own text value.\nTo answer the multiple choice question, we will say that John has 7 kilos of nuts and 2.55 kilos of dried fruits, which is a total of 11 kilos of nuts and 1 kilo of dried fruits. He also goes to the gym in the morning for 30 minutes each day. On average, John works out 6 hours a week at the gym.

There are a lot of ways you can create multiple choice answers, that we have covered in the previous chapters of LPT. However, above we have highlighted one of the most straightforward ways to address a multiple choice question: use text answers instead of multiple choice answers. Text answer are easier to answer, faster, and better than multiple choice answers! Let\u2019s take a look at some of the practical applications of text answers.\n\nText answers, in a very simple form, allow you to structure your answer. You can tell what the answer will be by the answer text displayed on the screen. For instance, if the answer is, \u201c1 kilos of nuts and 3 kilos of dried fruits cost $12\u201d, you can say the same thing if the answer is the number 1.

In the examples in the discussion, I think it's more important to get to know each one another than to have a very specific notion of how much time you'd spend together, since some couples have a lot of things in common and others much less so, and it might not be possible to get along on every thing.", "answer": "C: make love"}

As the sales progress, he becomes more profitable and more satisfied, until the company runs out of the best quality product. Then, he decides to sell it at a lesser profit. The final products end up having an average profit of 1.  The sales of the two worst quality products ended up producing a profit of -1. Total profit is -5. This is your average profit at the end of the second week that you make 120 sales to different accounts.  Total profit is equal to the following: 120 = 2 x 1.  If you sell 1.00 kilos of nuts at a profit of -1 and sell 3.00 kilos of dried fruits at a profit of 55.00, then your average profit is: 240 - 55.00 = 4.00.

{"text": "3\n\n#1: #4.  I do not think that the problem is the question itself.  There is a large amount of bias in that the question asks two questions at the same time.  The questions themselves are both not very accurate.  It is really more like this:  How often, when you were 16, went to the gym for more than an hour?  The answer is that you probably visited the gym more than that on rare occasions.  These responses tell me nothing about your experience.  The answer is a few people will not be able to answer the questions, since they spend more time away from their desk and have higher level careers.  So it is reasonable to pick 4 or 5 out of 100, and ask those people.\n\n#2: This question is designed to elicit a correct answer, since the correct answer is what you want and there are two correct answers.  This question is a trap designed to catch a true statistician.  It is impossible to come up with a real statistician who did this.\n\n#3: I think that what may be missing here is the question.  The question is asking people to respond to an unmeasurable characteristic (lifting), because if we had an objective statistic on the amount of people lifting weight, then the correct answer would probably be a higher percentage.\nThe follow up question then is:  As the interviewer and candidate interview for the same position, what would you like to know about him/her?  This should also be phrased as an objective question.\n\n#4: This question looks very similar to #3, except that the interviewer now knows that a person did lift weights.  Thus we get nothing out of answering it.\n\nI've asked this question in several interviews as well as many other career related questions, including surveys on performance reviews, personality assessments, and job performance.  This is one of the few questions which the interviewer actually asked about, so it is not a trap.  The interviewer now knows whether a candidate is \"hard working\" and the question is designed to provide the desired answer.  This is a good question because it should elicit a correct answer whether or not a person is lifting weights.\n\nThis method is more or less foolproof.  Usually, the interviewer knows if a candidate has a history of lifting weights.  If he answered this question correctly, he would already know if the candidate is a good team player or someone who gets angry from being asked", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

After he gave the bank the gold, he told the bankers that he wanted them to write him a cheque for the full amount of the gold they had been charged.

How many ounces does it take to get 1 ounce of milk?\" The child immediately says, \"12 ounces.\" How is this true? The answer is A: The kid says it right out and gives the answer with ease. However, the way A is said, it is more difficult to say \"one ounce\" or \"12 ounces\" than \"three ounces.\" Therefore, the answer is C: The kid's mother says too much. When asked that question, it is easier to say five ounces with ease as opposed to thirty-one! How is this true?

Now, how is it easier to say, \"half an hour each day\" than \"fifteen minutes each day?\" There: is a better way to say it: \"An hour or so each day.\" This way, the kid is much harder to trick into saying half his/her/its work day is spent doing pull-ups or doing pull-up sets and then say that his/her/its mother/father is lying when they say their work day is only half an hour a day.

The sign for cross the street is usually not seen by the deaf. In fact, many will not know how to say \"cross\" either. Only the deaf will know what this sign means and is much easier to work with.\n\nQuestion 3\n\nWhich of the two do you see the sign as meaning? This choice is really confusing for both of you. If you can't figure it out, ask someone who knows sign language to help you figure it out...\n\nA. You see it as \"come\" since signers can't use the word \"cross\" to represent this sign as well.\nB. Signers can say anything \"cross the street\" is a very normal sign for.\nC. The idea that you actually use the \"cross\" in this sign is a bit more complicated if you think about the way that the deaf are taught to look for signs. As soon as they hear it the word \"cross\" is always spelled \"cross street\"\nD. It's not a sign for crossing the street, it's a sign for crossing an imaginary line.\n\nAnswer: B\nAs is shown in the figure below, the two signs are both used by signers to communicate. The reason for this is that the sign for \"cross\" means \"move\" and the sign for \"cross the street\" means \"cross a line that's made from something that is movable\".\n\nQuestion 4\n\nThis question is really hard to figure out. Signers often add an \"an\" and a \"h\" at the end of a word to mean something completely different when they write \"cross street\". If you are trying to convey the concept of crossing an imaginary line on the sidewalk, do you sign the word \"cross\" as \"cross street\",", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

{"text": "Northern B\n\nInput: The population of Iceland (over two million) has been reduced by nearly half since 1970 when the Icelandic banking system crashed. The population lost nearly 60 percent of its jobs in the recession caused by this crash. Approximately one-third of Icelandic males between the ages of 21 and 29 are unemployable, the average household spends more than 30 percent of its income on rent, and one in four has received a loan or mortgage of at least 70 percent of its income.  In the midst of this crisis, Iceland's largest hotel chain, H\u00f3lsmann, filed for a public offering.  On June 20, 1998, the company's IPO was completed with the company being declared a \"going concern\" and raising $600m at $15 a share.  In 1999, Icelandic banks were the worst performing of all foreign bank stocks. Iceland was one of the first countries to use the International Monetary Fund's quantitative easing program to get the economy on a firm footing.  As a result of the financial crisis, Iceland's economy contracted by 10.6 percent in the second quarter of 1999.  The unemployment rate has steadily risen over the last year.\n\nInput: The average person in the US pays $4,150 a year in taxes.  Each year, the federal government grants approximately $150 billion in tax subsidies to individuals and corporations.  The tax bill for an individual who made $10,000 in 1998 is less than three hundred dollars, whereas a couple making the same amount each year gets to keep approximately $6,000 from the government!  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), tax subsidies in 1999 could reach as high as $1.5 trillion.  In 2004, the Congressional Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform estimated that total annual federal income tax concessions rose to between $5 trillion and $12 trillion, which was greater than the aggregate debt, the annual budget deficit and the combined total federal tax subsidies received by most major industrialized countries.\n\nOutput: As a result of the federal subsidy program, a typical U. S. family receives an additional $7,000 - $10,000 in tax relief each year.  This tax break does not only apply to the rich.  The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that the tax break for the poorest households will also swell.  A $500 rebate for families earning under $35,000 a year and a $400 tax break for all other families will be phased in over 10 years.

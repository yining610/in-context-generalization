The story goes:<n>A boy was about to reach the age where he could legally drive a car. He had been driving a truck for a year and thought it was time to get a new car. So, he went car shopping. While he was shopping, he heard an announcer talking about cars he had never seen before. The announcer was saying these cars had "no pedals, no steering wheels, no tires." The boy asked the salesman, what that meant. The salesman explained that the cars had no pedals, no steering wheels and they were all made to be driven using the body of the vehicle itself. The boy was curious. So, he asked the salesmen what the car he had heard so much about was like. The salesmen said, "This is the one!" The boy excitedly picked up the first car he saw:<n>The salesman asked the boy how that would be a problem. The boy told the salesman that the car would not fit him because of his height. The salesmen told the lad that although he could not put his feet inside the car, all it took were very long straps to keep the straps to fit him and that he didn't need to be a tall person in order to drive it. The boy decided to buy the car immediately.<n>That evening at dinner, when the salesmen had finished explaining the car, the boy asked them two questions. "Will this car still fit me when I get older?" And,
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:James was cooling off two quickly.  He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what? Choices:  A: loss of heat B: revenge C: expansion D: relaxation E: calm down<n>Output:		 We choose A to save him from losing the heat. Choose B to keep him from gaining the heat. Choose C to keep the heat in his room from expanding. Choose E to keep the heat outside from entering his room. These are all correct (just pick the one with the most votes). Choose D to conserve the heat. Choose E to save the time he already spent. Select the one you most chose from.<n>So for the total number of hours he spent in the fridge, we get 800 + 200 = 1600. He didn't cool off 2 quickly, so his refrigerator time was: 1600 * 2 = 1600<n>The final answer is 1640 + 400 = 1600*1600 = 5600<n>We were right in our choice, and James died.  Also, the total time he spent cooling down 2 quickly is 1440 * 2 = 1350. So his total time in the refrigerator is: 1350 * 2 = 1460<n><n>Input: When you want to know the future of your company, what types of data do you want from a forecasting software?<n>Output: We pick:<n>month<n>quarter<n>year<n>A: month-month<n>B: month-quarter<n>C: quarter-year<n>D: quarter-year-quarter<n>E: business-year (if you have no quarters)<n>We start with each month by subtracting from 1. Since each month is divided by 1 month, we start with 1 = 1 + (1 – 1.5) * 1 = 0.5. Since this is the number 1, we get 6 days until the end of this month.<n>Then we use the month we start with to calculate the month-month ratio for each month in the forecast period. Since we have six days left, we will need 0 days for the next month.<n>So we subtract 18.5 days = 56.5 from 1 to get 56 > 2 * 0.5 = 2 * 0.5 + 2 * (18.5 + 56.5) = 56 > 1 * 1 = 1 – (0.5 * 1.5) * (0.5 + 46.5) = 56 < 1 + 2 * (56 + 56.5) - 5 = 16 > 1 * 1.<n>We calculate 2 days left in the forecast period by subtracting 21 from 11. Since 11 < 14 > 1 * 1 = 2, we get: 15 days left + 21 = 55.5 days left (for 56 > 1, we need 0

Bob never really noticed anything about his house, except that sometimes he could see birds hopping along the fence. Alice would wake up at 05:30 and go downstairs to get a drink of water. But not too often. Every night, she would leave the house to go to bed at 07:00.<n>One day on a sunny summer's day, Bob heard the birds flying off again, so he decided to chase them after school. He ran after them in his car, but he couldn't overtake Alice too fast and he couldn't get her to move her car. When they ran into the corn field between their houses, Bob saw some birds flying away while Alice continued to drive very slow.<n>Bobby was very irritated because his car was parked in the shade of a few trees. He went to pick up his guitar for his solo in school band performances. He decided to pick up Alice's father who was a retired farmer, and take them both for a walk in the forest. He wanted to hear him playing the guitar and maybe get some tips from him. After he dropped them off at the nearest house, he decided to take a walk in the forest to clear his head.<n>When he came back, he found his parents in the living room talking to his mother. When he looked up from his guitar, he saw that his parents were both lying on the couch talking. He then saw a rabbit with a tuft of fur on his back, a rabbit the same height as he was, just pecking at a nearby bush. He smiled and looked over towards his parents. Alice's father was sitting up and staring at him with a big smile. Her mother was playing a game on her computer.<n>After the rabbit went away, Bob could see that Alice's father was sitting in the same position as the rabbit was. In front of Bob's father, was a large hole in the ground. Bob decided to try his luck in the hole in the ground. He looked up into the hole. When he entered, he found himself in a tiny room with a tiny window and some wooden shelves around it. Bob looked around the room. He

He named her Snow White. He found 2 other dogs, named them Snow White and Snow White. He has them in two separate cages from opposite sides of the house, so they always have a chance to fight. To train the dogs, put a collar on each dog's collar so that when they bark, it is very hard. He named his dog Snow White after the pet in the children's book who is always the one to win the fight. He named his other dog Snow White after Snow White. He named his new pet Snow White after the other two dogs. He gives them treats occasionally, to encourage them to bark so they don't get a collar on. The dogs bark when the boy is home from work. When the boy gets home, he shows off one of the dogs, and when he runs away, the other dog follows. When he comes to work, he has the other dog on a leash so he doesn't get into any trouble. When he is trying to get the other dog to sleep, he puts each dog in her new cage and puts them into their respective beds so they can't run away. When they sleep, each dog puts her paws on the other one's collar. When one of them starts to get mad at the other, she puts her paws on the collar and she walks away without getting yelled at. When she does get mad at the other one, she puts her paws back on the other's collar. How often does this happen?

So we have to consider the extra seats. Then we must consider that both the auditorium and the synagogue have seats for only 50 people each, and that there are 1000 people in the church. Then finally we consider that the auditorium seats have half the number of people that the synagogue and the church seats have respectively.<n>The extra seats for each religion total 600, so we have 600 * 50 * 1000 = 6000. Because the total number of seats in the auditorium is only 50, we have 100* 50 * 1000 = 2000 * 2000 times 1000 = 4000 * 8000 = 10000 people. The total number of people in each room is 10000. Therefore we can not find a place, that there is room for 4000 people. So none.<n><n>Input: We have 1000 books on our desk  The total number of books is 5000. The total amount of money we have at our desk is $6000. If we take out another 5000 book from one of the books on our desk, how much money would we have left at the end of the week?<n>Output: The total money we have at our office is $6000. So we can add $6000 to the money that we have left at the beginning of the week.<n>The total amount of money in our office now is $6000 = $6000 + 5200 = $6200<n>So we can add more than $6000 to the money left at the beginning of each week when we take out more books. So we can add more than 6000.<n><n>Input: There are 2 seats in the auditorium for the religious service. A: Auditorium B: synagogue C: confession D: confession<n>Output:  A <=> Auditorium <=> synagogue <=> confession <=> confession <=> synagogue <=> auditorium <=> church <=> confession <=> auditorium <--- all.<n>The number of seats in the Auditorium would be 20<n>The numbers of seats in each room would be: 20 * 2 = 50<n>The number of seats to the left of the auditorium would be 100<n>The number of seats left will total 20 * 50 = 100<n>So the total number in the auditorium is 20 * 50 = 70<n><n>input: We have a room with 10 seats
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve.

T-Mobile was one of the first companies to begin offering this service. B: It cost them $9.99 per month to offer their service. T-Mobile charged the customer only two different fees per month to continue their free service: 1-2 minutes of roaming calling from a land line, and 2 minutes of roaming calling from an email. They offered unlimited minutes of domestic and international roaming calling, but the cost of their service dropped from $9.99 to $4.99 per month with a two minute restriction added to each. So the customer could receive calls from anywhere without the cost of international rates. If T-Mobile was not charging international rates, then the customer should still have been charged 2 minutes of roaming using their free service. (If T-Mobile was charged the same amount of international calls when sending or receiving calls as they were in the same state as the caller or the number they were calling from, then the customer should have used their free roaming time as a call credit, which increased the cost from $9.99 per year to $6.99 per year for the customer.) This means that if 100 million T-Mobile customers started using this service, they would pay only 50% of what they would normally be charged for their first year.<n>Solution: A: 1,400,000,000 lines were added, but for 6 cents per minute of roaming. B: 100,000,000 lines are added, but for 2 cents per minutes of roaming.<n>Solution:C: T-Mobile began charging international rates on a rate at par rate (200 cents per minute.<n>Solution:D: No change<n><n>Input:What are the most common problems people have when searching for a job?

How many hours does it take to fill up 2 bottles of breastmilk for a baby?<n>Output: 2 hours.<n>Since we know that a 2 hour old baby weighs 20 pounds, then a bottle fills up 20 pounds, which is 20 x 0 or 12 ounces.<n>If the bottle fed one pound weighs 75 pounds, the number of bottles it takes to fill it up is 225.75 or 5.75 ounces.<n>Since it is 1 ounce for each bottle and 375 for each 2 liter bottle, it takes 3 cups or 3.25 gallons to fill 2 bottles for a 2 year old, for 48 hours.<n>The number of times a 2 year old can be fed a bottle of formula is 480 times, which is 2.5 litres in 3 gallons.<n>Total is 480 + 480 = 960 litres: 960 x 0 = 960 litres = 1,000 litres<n>If he were fed all day long, for 4 days, the amount of calories he stored up is 900,000. The amount of energy it takes to turn 9 ounces of breastmilk into 900,000 calories would be: 9 x 1800

He puts two coins in his pocket to count them when he gets off the bus (and count them a second time while walking home). After he has counted them he puts two more coins in his pocket. Next, one coin is inserted into the coin slot on the handle of the bus. It slides in smoothly and when the man picks up the coin, it has a spring-loaded mechanism that allows him to remove it easily. He has the same experience with the other three coins: one in the slot on the left handle, another in the slot on the right, and a third in the slot on the top of the bus. How many coins does the man have?<n>Output: The same amount as before, ten coins<n>At first count, he had three coins in his hand, but that was all in a single pocket.

Which one is the elder?<n>Output: We check the list of children and find that: 1 son, 1 daughter. Then we take the answer from the following table. The first child is born to father who has a different name to the father of the second child. (We do the same for the second child, but we don't do the same for the third, fourth or fifth child). We can't check children's ages separately due to the way we want to do the calculations. Therefore we assume that A and B are the same, C is older than the three youngest children, D is between the youngest two and the oldest. We take the answer from the table. The first and second child (father and daughter) have the same names; however, A was born to the father of the daughter first child. The second child (father and son) has the same name as the first child; however, his father (the one in blue) is not the son of the first child. Therefore, his father would be older than the first and second children. The third child (father and daughter's father) does not have a similar name to the father of either of the other two children that we see on the list: they have different first names. Therefore, he is not elder to any of the children. Therefore, the third child has the same age as the first daughter (his age). It's impossible to calculate the ages of the first two children by dividing the ages of the second two children because the ages of the mothers don't appear on the list. Therefore, we can't see the ages of the children individually. Instead, we assume that the first two children are the same.

B: Of course I will give you an allowance.<n>Output: If you are thinking that £30 will be a lot of money for you then that's not the case. You will be getting allowance £13 per month, every month for the next 3 years. So your allowance will last for the rest of your life. The reason you will be getting this kind of income is that the average income of an 18 year old in the UK is £6,450 (2006 figures) or £19,450. Therefore, for £15 per month, you will receive £130 for the rest of your lives. So the average age of a student earning £130 per month in the UK is 23. For that much money, you definitely deserve it. However, if you do not know how your allowance will be calculated then it is best to know as soon as possible.<n>Output: You need $130 to pay electricity, so you will get $13 per month, the usual allowance

The first problem has to do with a real number and not being able to divide it. Let's look at a number in some number of numbers. For now we will assume a real number is a number of 3's and a number of 2's. For example a real number could be 3.1213. Let's say that this real number of 3's and 2's is 3.121334. In this case if the real numbers are of the form 1.7, 1.7, 1,1 then a real number can also be three of three's and three of two's. This means that each real number can be the same as two real numbers of the form 4.121334 + 3.121334 + 5.6.121334 + 6.6 12.121334. etc. This means that each number can have a whole range of the same real numbers, which means that each number can be 1 to 1.2, 5 to 5, 8 to 8, 15 to 15, 27 to 8, etc. This may all sound complicated but it really isn't. Here is a handy little rule I have learned by reading lots. Every real number of 3's must have an infinite sum and every real number of 2's must have an infinite divisor.<n><n>input: 1.6 3.5 2.6 0.5 =<<1.6-3.5-2.6-0.5>>> 1.6 3.4 3.5 3.5 1.3 =<<1.64-3.5-3.4-0.5>>> 2.4 3.3 2.3 0.6 1.2 =<<1.944-3.5-4.4-0.6>>> 3.3 2.1 1.0 0.6 1.1 =<<3.619-4.4-3.2-1.0>>> 4.2 3.0 3.1 1.3 =<<4.2327-3.2727-3.0-0.6>>> 5.0 3.3 2.2 0.6 1.15 =<<5.2035-3.2035-3

You can do nothing from this perspective as it would be in your point of view.<n>So the total distance you have to travel for two girls looking at the sun is 1/4 of the distance they have to travel to see each other directly.<n>So the final average distance you have to travel to see the sun is 1/6 of the distance they have travel to see each other.<n>Since the distances between you and your friends are much more than the distances between you and the sun, the average distance you have to cross the sky by yourself to see the sun is 3/8th the average distance they have to cross by themselves.<n>So the average distance you have travel to see the sun (which represents the distances between you and them) is 10/18 of the distance they has travel to see the sun.<n>So the final mean distance you have to travel (which represents the differences in the distances between you and either them or the sun) is 3.1<n><n>Input:The question is, what is the difference between 5 minutes and 50 minutes?<n>Output:The question is asked to the following students<n>1 minute = 5 minutes + 2 minutes<n>50 minutes = 15 minutes + 7 minutes<n>75 minutes = 30 minutes + 7 minutes + 3 minutes<n>150 minutes = 36 minutes + 7 minutes + 12 minutes<n>300 minutes = 36 minutes + 6 minutes + 29 minutes<n>375-300 = 2 minutes in this order<n>The total number of responses received is:<n><n>Input:What are two numbers in a cube?<n>Output: The number of numbers in a cube is 32.<n>Since the cube is a 4×4 shape, how tall do you think it is?<n>output: The cube is 32×32=60×60<n>The total number of students who replied that they don’t know the answer is 24<n><n>Input:

Choices:  A: good health B: heart attacks C: relaxation D: rest E: fatigue<n>Output:		 You'll be surprised. But if you only ask your best friends about the benefits of exercise, then those of them that worked out on a regular basis would tell you they have become better as people and feel happier. So they probably don't need to be told the benefits. The truth is that most people who aren't good exercisers will benefit from a good walk or run (provided that they do not try to do too much of either in one day).<n><n>Input:What percentage of a teacher’s salary is attributed to per diem?<n>Output: How many hours are you paid per day for teaching full time?<n><n>Input: What are the 5 best books written in 2010?<n>Output: How much did each book cost in 2010?<n><n>Input:What was the value of the house on June 1 of this year?<n>Output: Is the market value of the house up or down in the next few months?<n>Since June was a rainy month, the value of the house was down.

Or it may stay empty for a few months until you can move into a new home.<n>Or it may become just an additional rental that you may rent out part of to pay for other expenses.<n>If you leave the house empty while you are away, then you must pay for damages to the house. Plus, you lose money from rent.<n>If you rent the house, then you get a share of the house income plus some interest that you may not be able to afford.<n>So for every extra cost you have to pay to take your vacation home away from the owner, then you must pay to rent the vacation home. That extra cost represents your share of the property income.<n>The worst way to spend a vacation house is if it is used to try to save money. For example, by renting out a few rooms during the week and taking a full week off. If the property isn’t rented, then the owner lost money. That means that by paying extra rent, the owner spent money he/she could have otherwise used to

You might laugh like you are laughing at you. You might feel a little fear like you are being hurtful. You might appear to enjoy the way the subject plays with you when you are afraid. You might look like they are staring at you as if to see if you are going to respond to them in a way that makes them laugh. You might be slightly embarrassed for your inability to control your reaction.<n>Input: A picture of someone you are scared of, what would you describe them as?<n>Output: The person you are thinking of is a man. He has a short haircut. He has a dark shirt and short dark pants. He has on a striped shirt. His eyes are bright red. His eyes are very blue. His face is round and has a good complexion. His face is set in a way that makes him seem a little tired/sick. When talking to the person you are thinking of, be extremely nice and polite. Make sure you say "Hi," "Goodbye," "Good morning," "Good evening/night" and "How you doing/What is going on." Look him directly in the eyes for a long time and make eye contact.<n>Input: Describe what scary things would look like to you.

Please be careful not to over think this question.<n>Output: In situations when a person makes eye contact with you, his face would turn bright red/pink in an uncanny way. That is your sense of self or an image of who you are. When the person you think is scary looks away and talks to someone else, you would look away quickly and smile/act normal. When the person says hello in the same way, you will be slightly relieved because you think they don't like you and they are being friendly. When the person you see is about to talk to another person, instead of staring at them, you will turn away and smile/act normal<n>Input: Are you frightened or not?<n>Output: When someone you are looking at tells you to smile/act friendly, you can look them in the eye, and if the person you saw before was friendly, you can then look them in the eye again.

Darlene has $1,000 left in savings, $1,000 in bank, and $2,000 in personal debt. Darlene’s bank and personal checking accounts have balances of $150 each.<n>Output: Give the total amount of money. We get $2,100, or 100 + $150 = 10110.<n>The person’s income from work has increased by 60%, but the person’s expenses have increased by 40%. With a $100 difference, Darlene is earning 1.00%, while the person is losing money by 50%. Thus Darlene has gained $100, not $1,000. Thus Darlene does not have 100 extra dollars, and the person does, indicating that the person has 100 extra dollars. Thus 100 + 10110 = 10110<n>If the $1,000 is not in her checking account, she cannot make payments. The sum in savings, then, must go into the checking account. The bank has no funds. The bank is being insolvent. If the person can pay the bank her mortgage interest, it will provide the sum that is in savings. She must pay that sum by purchasing goods or services. The total sum of all products and services she is able to purchase is: 10760 + $150 minus $150 = 10710, or the total of $2,100. Thus the total sum of all goods and services she is able, with $2,100, to buy is: 10760 - $150 = 10710. With the $150 in savings, the total sum of savings is 10710 + $150 = $21710. Thus the total sum is increased by $10760. Her debt from personal loans has almost doubled. Thus this total sum of savings must be paid, but with a total sum of $2,100, the sum of all goods and service a person can buy will drop

Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n>Output:		 The water might be coming from someone’s shoes on the sidewalk. The shoe leaves the floor and it starts to sink below ground level.<n>A couple who are walking down the sidewalk have their shoes soaking wet. They are also wearing sandals and those are wet as well (but they are not wet as much since they are not wet as shoes.) A little way down the street they see a large puddle on the road, and it might be coming from a car that stopped. There is also a very large puddle near their vehicle. The vehicle is very wet, both the car and some of the clothing inside. They decide they are going to go inside to dry off before the car dries out, and they get on the sidewalk to dry off. While drying off, they notice a puddle below them. Their shoes and sandals start to collect water in the shoes and sandals. When they put their shoes back on both shoes completely wet. So they decide to walk over to the puddle and get dry. The problem with this scenario is that the only puddle they can see is far away and no where near them. When they reach the puddle they walk around and try to see if they can see a puddle near their feet, but they can’t. So they decide to grab their shoes and get dry. To get dry they walk close to their vehicle to get the dirt off them, but then the car stops near the puddle and the car becomes completely wet. They get dry and decide to head back to the SUV, which is now dry. The car is now completely wet, with shoes and sandals completely wet. They wonder why the car is wet but they forget to turn off the engine in a hurry before they go inside. They wonder if they can go into the garage to dry off because the windows can stay open while drying off, but they decide that isn’t a good idea. They end up walking some more to find another puddle, and they decide to walk back to their vehicle to dry off. When they get back to their vehicle and turn off the engine their vehicle is completely dark. But when they turn the engine on again and start it nothing happens. So they decide they are going to have to get in their vehicle and drive until they find out what the cause of the car becoming wet is. They drive and drive some more. The water of the puddles are really getting to the vehicle now, the tires are getting completely wet, and they

If you can get by one way alone, without stopping, how far can you get by the other way?<n>Output: You can get to work in either route, provided the other is faster<n>In the photo on the left, we can see that Alice went the way on the right. Alice took about 7 minutes on her one way out of work. This is faster than the other way. But it is 7 minutes more work. This means that she spent 2 more minutes working than she needed to, because she took longer to get to work by the one way route. So Alice spent 4 minutes more traveling one way, than she needed to. So in total, the two routes are equivalent, as long as she had taken the same amount of time traveling both ways. But in this case, she has taken twice as long for work by going the way on the right as the way on the left. Therefore, she has wasted two minutes traveling the extra mile. So Alice has wasted 2 minutes and 37 seconds for the extra mile on this one way ride. She has taken 3 minutes and 55 seconds longer by going the way on this one way, than when using the other way. So there is a difference between getting to work in 1 mile by the way on the right, and 1 mile by the way used by John the other day (which is the same distance they traveled by the one way), but in this case, the extra mile has a lot more wasted time invested. So now Alice has wasted 4 minutes, and 30 seconds driving the extra 7 miles to work then she would if using

How many balls will their teammates catch?<n>Output: You need to subtract 3 balls from each team’s total count of balls. Then divide each team’s ball total by 3, and multiply by the number of players on each team to get a total score. You also need to divide each team’ score by the total number of balls they are able to catch.<n>If 3 balls are passed from team A to team B and 3 balls are caught by team B, team A’s score is 40 + 3 = 60. So the score is 60/3 = 60 and Team B’s score is 110 + 3 = 140. So they have completed all 100 balls.<n>If 3 balls were passed from team A to T and 4 balls were caught by T, team A has completed all 200 balls, meaning Team A has completed 10,000 balls. Team A has completed 10 times 8.4 = 112 balls. Team T has completed 0 times 100 balls. So they both have complete 2.25 balls less than Team A.<n>Team A has completed 4,150 balls.

At the end of the day he will get home and look out of his window and see a star. At the same time the other two men will work for the same amount of time. Both men will start working right after noon. How long will the man work for each day?<n>Output :At 10 am each day, the man will work for 10 hours and then get off at 2 am. Then he will get up at 10 am and work again until midnight. The next day he will do the exact same thing. At the end of 10 days he will work for 12 hours and get off at 3 am. Then he will work again for 12 hours the next day and continue to do so for the remaining 9 days. At the end of 12 days the man will have worked 12 hours one day, 8 hours the next and 6 hours the 9th day. So the final answer is 28 hours of work each day.<n>The total hours that work is divided by the total working hours of the other men is 27 hours = 56 hours. So the total working hours of both men is 56x55 = 112 hours, or 8 hours per day.

However, you will also spend 10 hours at work.  What do you do about travel to/from work?  What kind of car would you normally drive?  Answer these questions to get one point each.<n>1) In this scenario, you do not drive your car, so you would not drive to work.  You would take the bus.  The closest bus stop is 2 miles from your house.  (The total distance is 7 miles round trip.)  2) The car you usually drive would most probably be an SUV.  An SUV can take 5 adults plus a child in the back for a 3-hour trip.  In this case though, the SUV would be too large to take along on the bus.  The vehicle you selected may vary depending on many factors.

The reason? He can't be happy when the other person is happy. When they both start to be happy at the same time, a problem occurs.<n>We know that a problem is when one person is not happy because the other is happy. So what about two people who are not happy because they are happy? How can they be happy?<n>Output:  We add the total number of times that they are not happy to the total number of times they are happy (and they are not happy): [1] + [(1 – their own unhappiness) / 2] = [2 times their unhappiness + 1 – their happiness] = [(2 – their unhappiness + 1 + their happiness)] – [(100 + their unhappiness) – [(100 + happiness)] – [(100 - unhappiness)] = [(200 times their unhappiness + 100 times their happiness)]<n>Output: [1] + [(100 + their unhiness) / 2] = [(200 times their happy + 100 times their unhappiness)] + [200 times their happiness + 100 times their unhappiness + (100 - unhappiness)] – [(200 times their unhappiness + 100 times their unhapiness)] = [(200 times unhappiness + 100 times unhappiness) + [(200 times unhappiness - 100 times unhappiness]) = [(200 times unhappiness + 100times unhappiness + 100 - unhappiness)] = 8.25<n>As we can see, we have added 8.25 + 8.25 + 2 + 1 = 11.75 + 11.75 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 15.25<n>Add 2+2+2 +2+2 +4 +5 +3 = 20<n>Add 4+4 +4 +4 +5 +4 +5 = 30<n>Add 5+5 +5 +5 +5 = 40<n>Add 6+6 +6 +6 +6 = 60<n>Add 6+6+6 +6 +60 = 100<n>Add all the numbers together: 40 + 60 = 100 + 100<n><n>Input: A person is trying to find his/her family photograph.

You decide to have your 12-year-old son take one of your kids out to the park while you stay home alone. You decide to watch a movie and have dinner afterward. You buy popcorn, some drinks and some candy since you usually buy your kids candy. You decide that with your time alone at home, you will probably enjoy yourself.

She spends 500,000 points on various items each month for her home and personal use. If the employee’s spending was to be reduced to half what it is now, how much total would each of the items have to cost for her to spend half of what she currently does?<n>Output: Let’s pretend the bill of exchange is a fraction of the actual amount of 500,000 points, let’s assume it is 1/2, and let’s also assume the points are the same as her spending. So the actual amount of spending will be: 1/2 * 500,000 + 100,000 * 500,000 = <<1/2*500,000-100,000-500,000-500,00-.25>>125,000 points. Now her spending will be: 1.125 * 1/2 = <<125,000-500, 00-.25>>125 points. How many points would she spend if she reduced her spending to: 1/125 * 0.25 = 500 points.<n>So her spending would be: 1.125 / 0.25 = <<500 points >>500 points<n><n>Input:On Tuesday, the school was closed because there was no student present.

Then the choice that he made in his first journey will be wrong.<n>So in the end John travels the route of the highway. He ends up in his desired destination, which is California.<n>If John used the highway instead of walking on the dirt road, he would end up in his destination in Mexico on his first journey. Then he would later be able to go North again after arriving in California because after exiting the US he would have reached Mexico.<n>If John decided that he wanted to take the highway from Mexico to the united states, he would be able to reach Oklahoma on his third journey and head North instead of on the dirt road toward Louisiana. John then could eventually reach Louisiana on his fourth journey from Oklahoma. After arriving in Louisiana, if John traveled along it North, he would reach Arizona, then Arkansas. After getting to Arkansas on his fifth journey, if he travelled along it North towards Florida the route that John used would be wrong, because Florida is already in the United States.<n>This answer is incorrect. John wouldn't be able to reach Louisiana on his fourth or fifth journeys because by that point, Louisiana has already had a history of being in the United States. So the answer is D. At first, John would be able to hit Arkansas, then Florida. However, his fifth journey would be wrong because that also would have included Alabama. So the answer is E. When John wants to hit Arizona, he will have a better chance at reaching the Arizona than he did when he started his journey.<n>The correct answer is B. John would need to take a shortcut if he wanted to reach Arizona from Mexico by using the highway.<n><n>Input: Larry bought a 10-inch TV and a 40-inch TV for each of his children.

It is a bus stop because it is part of the bus that runs along the busy street. It is on the street because parking would not be possible in most garages. It is on the bus because there is no public transportation that goes that far. It is in a store front because there are less than 1,000 people living in your city. So it is not found in your city.

Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n>Output:		 He prefers the woodland option, but I have to give him the benefit of the doubt and also think he went around and around in circles for a while deciding.  He probably just tried them all.  Since the park is not an option, he must have a very low bar to be able to go to a woodland.<n>What then am I missing?  Where's the problem?  Since he's not afraid of going to the pet store, he most probably avoids the parking lot.  And from what we've been told, the parking lot is the place where most animal abuse is actually committed.  What is all this about?<n>So I can't put the park into the woods, since it's so far from anything animal related.<n>Consequently, he probably avoids going to the north america option as well.<n>North america isn't much of an option since he lives in south america.<n>But what if I make the problem even worse and make the woodland option an option?  In theory, the problem is that he isn't so careful in selecting his place of going because he would be leaving animals inside the house he lives in.<n>Then he should avoid going to the woods because it's one of the places where animals would be abused, and animals should not be abused.<n>Why don't I?

Since this figure is a lot different than most countries' population, India should be getting a very large number of immigrants since their birth rate is the lowest. But these immigrants are still not able to take up any of the population, which is decreasing. Can you explain why this is?<n>Output: In many countries, the proportion of the population that is below the age of 50 is much higher than 50%. This is because of a great deal of infertile married couples. These couples tend to have fewer children because their fertility rates are not high enough. These couples are also in a small number of couples who get married. This number becomes quite large when the total number of persons becomes 5,500 million. Therefore, most of this immigrants are people of other age groups, since they have more children than the women in their families will bear.<n>Input: The planet is getting very small in the near future. The population will not be able to contain the population. There will be a great increase in the deaths and therefore the total human population is increasing. Therefore, a large number of immigrants will be coming from the other side of the earth. India is the top destination for these people. India is being taken over by many immigrants. Will all of them be allowed in?<n>Output: Indians are generally very accepting of their foreign colleagues. They are ready for any race, color, disability, and religion. In spite of the economic downturn, Indian people are very optimistic, open-minded people. They are extremely trusting and friendly. They will be the ones coming to India. Many people from other countries will be able to assimilate into our culture, and will be welcomed. Therefore, they will be able to live in India as long as they can do so successfully

In the past month they have made only 1% profit. They have invested $1000 in stock. With an expected return of $3000 in profits a year, how much money could they have saved from keeping this money locked up instead?<n>Output: The most likely result is that this company loses a substantial amount of money each year due to the value of the oil company dropping because the value of their currency gets tied to the dollar. Assuming a risk-free rate of return, you would have to be making $30,000 per year, otherwise your money will be worth much less then the $1000 that they invested.<n><n>Input: A college student has decided he has decided to change the world.

Ask them about their history with activism and involvement with projects such as those in the previous chapter. Also, if they are supportive of activism through the university they will be happy to support you in bringing about change. If they are not, then you will have to find a way to achieve change yourself.<n><n>Input: If you are going to change the world, the first thing to do is to find the right place. Now, you may be interested in a particular city area but that is not the best place to go. Most of the places in the world that are considered to be the most successful ones have moved in phases. If you are to help build up that kind of revolution then you need to find out what it is about these places that distinguishes them and find that phase that has been going on for years, or the phase that has been going since before there was even a notion of change.<n><n>Input: At a party, two boys are having some trouble trying to score blow.

Choices:  A: pudding B: get news C: strain D: answer E: though<n>Output:		 Let c = the word on the top and each letter be its own answer.<n>Let a = each letter, and then C = each letter, each column. Then we count each letter as a word. For example, Let c = pudding. Then all a's are pudding, since pudding has one letter that is pudding. Now, we count each column for each letter. If we counted each column as a word, then we got pudding. So, let us count each column as a word. Let us count them as letters: A: pudding, C: pudding<n>Let A = each letter, the same way, until we reach C. Then we only count as a letter.<n>So, let us count each and every point as a word, since C is pudding. And we count the words in C = every word. Let us count A as a word. Then let us count every letter in C = every word too; C = every letter together. So, let us all count together as a word. Let me count every letter in C, too. And then let us all count together, too. That is, let us all count everything as a word. That is as long as there are no mistakes. Let us count everything we can think of as a true word, not a mist. Let us count every possible combination of words; every kind of word too. Let us all count them all as true words, not as mist. Let us all count as true words, not mist. Let us not count as mist words. Let us count them all as true ones, not as mist ones. Let us count as true words, instead of mist words, or a mist. Let us all read this sentence as true ones, and count as a word as well. Let us count all the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as true words, instead or mist ones, or mist words; 1, 2, 3 or 4 to a word. Let us all count every word together as a word. Then, let us add together all the words we have read, since starting from A and ending with C, and let us add it all together. Let us add the last few words in the last three sentences as our last word too. And then let each letter of word be its own last word too. Let us count all numbers that are in C. Then let us count as many words that have more letters than C, as well as every

He will need another three years of strong laxative before he can make it to his 5th year without an after breakfast bowel, and then he will still need three more years of strong laxative to last through 5 years.<n>So this person will survive until approximately 5,200 years<n><n>Input:We want to know the number of people who are suffering from the flu pandemic right now. Our best estimate would be 5,000,000. There are, however, two different methods we can use to estimate how many people actually have the flu. One method would be to look at the number of people who have died from the flu and find out the number who have died from other diseases. This would be a total of 100. Since the flu pandemic is spread by droplets, this would be the total number of people that are actually dying of the flu.<n>The other method would be to look in an annual flu epidemics and get the total number of people diagnosed with the flu. This would be the total number who are actually sick, and who are actually dying of the disease. This would be a partial number<n>Therefore, based on the first method, our estimate would be 5,200,000 total

Choices:  A: amount to nothing B: visit relatives C: charming D: doctor himself E: cross street<n>Output:		 we can say the answer is A. The probability of no one being found in the woods is 1/10. The probability that someone will be found is 1/100. And the probability that 2 people or more will be found is 1.7. So the real answer is A. In general, if you are alone in the woods, call somebody.<n>That means that if two people are found in the woods you have a better than 50% chance that someone will come along in order to help or be discovered.<n><n>Input:What is the probability that an empty pool of water will contain a fish?<n>Output:We can find the probability by using the rules of probability:<n>If it's the same number, add to it. If the sum is the same, subtract from it. If it's a power of two, multiply by it. For the first three we can use the rule, but for the last two that means we must draw our own conclusions. The sum must never be less than the sum of the numbers (except for the powers of two - which is itself not the same, so we just accept it).<n>And so we can find the probability that the empty pool contains a fish and the answer is (the probability of an empty pool containing fish is exactly 1)<n><n>Input:What happened to the girl and her shoes in the woods?<n>Output:We know that in the real world the probability that there will be a foot in a pool of water is 1.5. So we can find the answer using probability<n>If F is the same as G and H are the same as I, then<n>G and H together are 1/2+1/(1+1)=1/5.<n>So therefore:<n>1/4+1/5 = 1/2<n>1/5+1/4= 1/3<n>1/3+1/4 = 1/2<n>So the answer is 1/2<n><n>Input:You are alone on a mountain with a group of people (in the real world the group would be a school) and you are hungry and cold. You know you will be attacked for your shoes and the question is... How much of a person are you?<n>Output:We find that when the group goes, one person can be a full-grown horse. So how much of a person are we (as you)?<n>Since we are, we share something in common with the horse. If we kill the horse, we will

He decided to name the giraffe "Raj", after the Indian King "Rajiv", who once lived there. The boy went on to ask for a pen to hold his new giraffe, he was disappointed as no pens were for sale. He went home and put his pen in the drawer of his bedroom. The next day, he returned to the zoo and noticed that even the little paper cups would only hold the giraffe for a few minutes. Disappointed, he asked a guide why there were no pens at the zoo. A guide replied that Raj was being treated at a zoo in Mexico, where all animals had been slaughtered to be eaten. Raj began to cry inside the pen, so he was taken to the carousel. All around the carousel he saw other animals being slaughtered with the same pen. Then he asked the guide, who showed him where Raj was, will Raj let him have a pen? So the child was taken back to the carousel where Raj was once again being forced to suffer all the same.

Then Raj was allowed to run around at the zoo. The man later returned to Raj's pen to find not a pen but a cage. At Raj's cage he found two tiny animals inside the zoo, the giraffe and a dog. Raj looked at the man and said, "I would like them to be freed from your zoo". The man replied, "why would you do that?". A little later, the dog was returned in Raj's pen. Raj gave the dog a few kisses, and the man was amazed. After a few minutes, he returned to Raj's pen in his carousel and was once again forced to watch his animals being killed. Raj was finally allowed to run around the zoo. Raj wrote in his diary this was his most satisfying experience, he was so happy. Later the child walked alone through the zoo, with Raj in pursuit. Raj followed, but Raj was now too big. The child stopped when they were within a couple hundred yards of each other and Raj stopped as well. Raj looked into the child's eyes and whispered, "What are you waiting for?" The child ran around Raj and took a big step forward. Raj was so

Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday.

He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Where would someone be likely to store a double edge razor? Choices:  A: pocket B: shower C: chemist D: drug store E: shaving kit<n>Output:		 A, B, C, D, E.<n>Suppose a person who has no reason to buy the double edge razor stores his razor in the pocket on Tuesday and then he has it in his pocket on Wednesday after work. Does the person still have to pay twice on Wednesday? Yes, since he would have needed to use this pocket to put the razor in and then place the razor in a different pocket to put it back out.<n>The double edge razor costs $15, which is $15 divided by 2 times that person's time. So he stores his razor in the chemist pocket that costs only $.75 per day – that is $.75/day * 2 = $.25.<n>He then has to re-purpose his pocket on Thursday – he would like to store this razor in the shaving kit pocket that costs $.75 per day so he doesn't have to buy two kits to shave again on Thursday. Unfortunately, to do that, he would have to pay for a second kit so it goes without saying he does not need the razor he is wearing.<n>So what the final answer is is 2*2*2 = 8.8 / 2 = 8.8/15 =.28<n><n>Input: Where would someone be likely to keep their favorite piece of furniture?<n>Output: A: on the couch B: on the desk C: in a dresser D: in a box E: in the guest bathroom<n>A: On the couch B: On the desk C: In the desk D: In the box E: On the dresser<n>A $100 sofa is $55. If the sofa was a new sofa and the desk was used at home, does the money paid for both be counted as $100? No, because the cost to the sofa user was $27.33 and the cost to the sofa owner was $22.33.<n>So we get:<n>$55 = 55/50$22.33 = $55 * 1.25 = $55 * 2.25 = $55.25 (25% discount added) = $55.25<n>$55.25 = <$80/60<n>$55.50 = 0% discount<n>$55.25 * 2 = $55.25/3 = $55.25 dollars<n>$55.25 divided by 2 and multiplied by 3 times times times 3 times time times 3 times times 3 times times 3 = 57<n>57 times $55.25 = $10<n>$10 divided

He walked into a lumber yard.  After buying a saw, he walked further and further away down the road to find a piece of timber. After 45 minutes of walking, he found a piece of timber.  He walked again back to the yard for more wood. He would walk for 3 more hours before he finally found a piece.  He bought a box of tools in case he needed to buy further wood. Once he had all the tools with him, he went back to the yard, where he had already seen other wood.  He had purchased all the wood he needed to build a new fence, but he knew that he would need more before he could build the fence.  He walked for two more hours before he found a piece of wood. After walking for five hours to make money building a fence, he got home. He built his fence, and later bought a home.  He made so many trips to the store for tools and wood that he would often buy more wood and tools, making himself travel longer distances to get more wood and tools. The more times that he went in stores looking for tools and wood, the taller his profile got, the more money he earned, and the more people he talked with.  The more times he went in stores looking to buy tools and wood, the more wood he got from the stores. The more wood he got from stores, the bigger his family got. The more people he talked with, the funnier they became, because if they understood each other better, they would be more willing to help him solve everyday problems. So his answer is B<n>Bobby was looking for wood in different stores, searching for pieces he could buy at two yard sales. He did not understand what he wanted because he did not understand the rules of yard sales.  The more times that this happened, the faster his profile got.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:How often are secular parties held?

Which ones of these three got married first?<n>Output: A*=Bob, B*=Carol, C*=Mark, D*=David, E*=Mark<n><n>Input: The year 2015 is the same year as 2002. You, Alice, and Mark have different birth years. Your birth year differs only slightly from Mark and Alice's birth year. Which of the three people had a more recent birthday?<n>Output: A+B=Alice, B+C=Mark, D=Alice<n><n>Input:<n>You have a $1000 bill, worth $1000 less than when you first got the bill.<n>Suppose you lose the $1000 bill and are unable to find it again. What do you need to do to get the $1000 from $1000? And what if you would have still needed to get that $1000 even if you found the $1000 in the first place?<n>Output: The time of loss of the bill can be determined from the total loss of the bill. Thus the time of loss must be > $1000.<n>So the total amount of the bill is (100 * $1000) + (100 * $1000 x $200) = $1000<n>So the final answer of the following question is $20, not $20,000.<n>Input: You are going to borrow $100 to meet the cost of your ticket for a roller-coaster ride. You borrow it and it is returned 30 days later. What does this $100 cost you?<n>Output: The actual money you need to pay for your ticket is $100. The amount you need to pay is < $100. A cost of $100 x $100 = $100<n>So the final answer would be 40<n><n>Input:<n>John has $1000 to spend on the holiday, but he is not sure whether he should pay for the car, the

Choices:  A: run B: swimming C: calculate things quickly D: fight enemy E: urinate<n>Output:		  A: run  Running is faster than swimming, if his friend had asked him to run, he would have done it.  Doing calculations quickly is more efficient than performing experiments.  Urinating while afraid is dangerous because it causes the person to be paralyzed.  Calculating is faster than performing experiments if you want to solve problems.  Fight your enemy.<n>  B: Swim because he may see the enemy as a friend in the future.  If he sees them as an enemy the enemy is likely to use the opportunity to attack.  He should swim if he thinks that is unlikely.  Calculating how much he should try to save the day is the most important, least fun to do.  Fight your enemy is the worst.    D: fight  Determining exactly where to throw an explosion that he needs to throw is more efficient than determining its distance.  If the enemy wants to be able to shoot him too (which might be the case), he should run.  Calculating how far a bullet needs to go to hit is most efficient than determining how fast he needs to run.  Fight your enemy may be the best because you are doing things that your enemy does not do, at a lesser cost.<n>  E: urinate  If nothing else is working, this might make him vomit, so run.  Calculating his location after the explosion should be the hardest.<n><n>Input: What is the speed at which an earthquake happens?<n>Output: We know the earthquake velocity is 3 m/s (3/2 m/s).<n>We know the earthquakes velocity in seconds is 100 m/s (100 m/ssec), we also know that the earthquake's acceleration is 15 m/s/s (15 m/s for a second).<n>What is the speed of the earth while it's on it's side (when there are no other moving objects around)?<n>Output: The earth was at rest.<n><n>Input: Alice was at a party last Sunday.

What is the oldest heat source on Earth? Choices:  A: fire B: solar energy C: sun D: house E: coal or wood<n>Output:		 Dan used the oldest heat source on earth (fire), which is ilevel-1207. The heat source uses the oldest ilevel-1206 coal which is ilevel 1250. The house and the solar panels are ilevel-1204. The source is ilevel-1183. The source uses ilevel-1205. Dan's kitchen and his bathroom share the ilevel-1209 oven. His bed is ilevel- 1223. The family's kitchen and bathroom all share the ilevel 1203 refrigerator, but share the ilevel 1310 stove which is ilevel 1320. There is a ilevel-1315 ilevel-1322 ilevel-1320 ilevel-1330 air-conditioning unit. The family's room is also ilevel 1320 at ilevel 1322 and 1330 at ilevel 1320, so ilevel 1322 is also the oldest unit in ilevel 1320 and 1330.<n>The total heat energy expended on that ilevel-1310 house and that ilevel 1205 oven is: 600 = 880 = 60 = 60.<n>To keep the house at its hottest temperature you would need ilevel-1201 for a total of 1600 watts<n>To maintain these temperatures, he would need ilevel 1202 for a total of 1600 pounds.<n>For 1000 watts the annual total is 1680 pounds, so ilevel 1201 is still the oldest source.<n>But what if he used ilevel-1202 instead of ilevel 1201?<n>Then the annual total is 2400 pounds, so ileval-1210 is still the oldest source by a little more than a pound.<n>Thus the total heat energy expended on ilevel-1210 in total: 880 + 2400 = 920 = 920 watts, because ilevel-1215 is the oldest source.<n>The energy consumed in ilevel-1250 is: 1600 = 60 = 60 / 2000 = 200<n>So the total heat energy consumed is 2000 watts = 1600 = 2400 = 960 = 960 watts.<n>So the total heat output is 1600 Watts, which is about 3.5 kW or 515 Wp per month.<n>Therefore, the total cost for this house is 800 × 960 / 1600 = 515 = $30.<n>So the total cost for this kitchen and its bathroom is $30 + $

Choices:  A: insane B: annoy people around C: enjoy D: inhale E: had good voice<n>Output:		 Ali doesn’t sing very much. The difference between her and those who sing is that she enjoys singing, not just singing to help herself relax and have time to think. Her goal is to have a quiet song come out of her and just sing that every time she is able to relax. So there isn’t an obvious answer for song choice; the options are what Ali likes most.<n><n>Input: The girl on the picture went to see a music teacher at school. She asked him about music lessons.

He explained to her what to do to play the drums, how to tune them, how to play bass guitar, and how to use her cymbals and to practice. How long did it take to learn to play the drums and bass?<n>Output: Ali liked music lessons. She is very easy to teach how to play the drums and she is better at the bass guitar than she was at the drums. Because of that, her teacher wanted to teach her more. The teacher said that she could do this every month during the next 12 months and she should be able to master the drums in less than 12 months. How long did it took her to learn how to play the bass?<n><n>Input: The teacher told the class that she could be a teacher if she wanted to. She asked a few close friends/relatives if they were interested. She went on a few interviews.

She then asks all the friends in the last group. How many names of who they are should she give?<n>Output: It started to be easier for the teacher to find the people she wanted. She asked her husband, a close friend, and his friends for help. Then she went on to ask people on her own, online, and in the neighborhood. However, by the end of week 3, the teacher wasn’t able to find very many that she wanted. Finally to see when she will be able to teach people to learn music, she asked her own mom for help. How long did it takes the teacher to get all that she wanted?<n><n>Input: Why are there so many different kinds of birds? Choices:  I: birds that live in forests/hills /seas/open fields

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday.

He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:What is the opposite of foolhardy? Choices:  A: thoughtful B: discreet C: calculated D: cautious E: careful<n>Output:		 Foolhardy: to be foolish without knowing the consequences:  A foolhardy is doing something without thinking about the cost. A foolish person does not want to be a burden. If he or she is not a burden, it is only foolishness when the cost is huge. It is a kind of mental illogical thinking, but not always the same thing as an emotional reaction.<n><n>Input: A customer buys 3 cases of soft drinks for $100. He uses 1.5 cases in 30 days, leaving the balance unused for the next 30 days. In his company, there is a policy that says soft drinks cannot be used if they are used within 30 days of purchase. The soft drinks he sells are expired. How many cases would be necessary to buy enough supplies for the entire month?<n>Output: 3 weeks * 100 = $600<n>3 months * 100 = $1200<n>3 years * 100 = 120<n>3 million * 100 = $600 million<n>The customer will have spent $600,000 on soft drinks, which will be a burden on the company.<n>The customer will be expected to pay for the full value of his purchase.  It is, therefore, fair for the company to expect him to reimburse them for some portion of his cost.  The amount is not very much, but if he is willing to pay for the full purchase, the burden is fairly minimized.  For example, even if he uses half of his purchases and gives the balance to the company, it would be fair if the company gave him $50 per use.<n>Output: 2 months + 30 days = 60 days<n>30 days * 30 = 120 days<n>So the customer will have used 60 times his purchase amount in 30 days.  If he leaves the balance unused for the rest of the 30 days, he is unlikely to have a problem.<n>Output: 120 / 120 = $600<n>So the customer will pay $600 per month for soft drinks for three years.<n>Output: 300 / 30 = $1,000<n>So the customer will be responsible for paying $1,000 in three years.<n>Output : (15-60 x 600 * 300 ) = 2,500<n>Output : (150 x 1200 ) = $1200<n>So the customer will spend 2,500 on soft drinks.   He has saved 1 year per $1,000 cost.<n>Output: 800 x 600 x 60 = $800<n>So the customer will need to make $160 for every $1,000 spent

They are at home so they sell 100 on the market for 50 per candy. They buy 100 more on the first day of school so they sell 50 per candy.<n>To sell 100,000 each day they buy 150,000 candies from other students. On the first day of school, they sell 400 candies. On the second day of school, they make 400 candies. On Wednesday they sell 400 candies, Saturday they sell 10,000 candies, Sunday they make 10,000 candies.<n>How much money did they make on the second day of school?<n>Output: If they sold 400 candies for 150 cents each and made 400 per period that would be $2,000. They could only sell 600 candies on Wednesday, so they are only half as rich, but they spend their 50 cents on the other candies so they don't lose money!<n>On Wednesday they spend their 50 cent candy and on the fourth period they spend the rest of the 1st period. They had to sell 200 candies to earn the same amount as 100.<n>So, the total they made on the first part is:<n>$4,000.00 / 400 = $150.00<n>They can't sell any more candies on Wednesday so they need to sell 600 candies per day to earn the same as 100. They spend part of the 3rd period selling only 50 candies so their total cash after selling the candies is:<n>$4000.00 /<n>50 candy

Choices:  A: antique store B: in the graveyard C: kitchen D: junk yard E: ice<n>Output:		 Each option has a cost. A broken ice box has a cost of 1 book. A broken ice box in the graveyard costs 6 books and an icebox in the kitchen is worth 4 books. We subtract the total cost of 2 books and the total cost of 3 books, which we get 3 books.<n>Then we subtract the total cost of 1 book from 3 books and add up the total times 3, which we get 6 books. We divide 6 books by 2 for a total cost of 2. The total cost + the cost of 1 book comes to the amount of 3 books that a broken icebox would cost.<n>So the final cost of a broken icebox is: 6/2 * 2 + 2 * 1 = 1 book.<n>So we have found that broken icebox:<n>1 book: 100/2 = 50 books (2)<n>1 book:<n>100/2 * 1 = 40 books (2)<n>100/2 * 2 =<n>40 books (2)<n>* 1 = 50 books (1)<n>(1)

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Where could you find a theater which only has unpaid actors? Choices:  A: shopping mall B: hospitals C: populated area D: school E: military base<n>Output:		 In a shopping mall, all of the available actors are in attendance until 1:59 pm the next day. After 1:59 pm, all of the available workers are in attendance. The remaining actors remain on duty. In a hospital, the available actors are not in attendance until the next morning. All the available workers are present at 1 pm the next day. In a military base, all of the available cast members are in attendance until 4:00 pm the next day.<n>The total number of actors who were not in attendance on this day is 400<n><n>Input:Which letter should you assign the highest number of points to?<n>Output: The second letter should be assigned the most points because it is the most common letter.<n><n>Input:What were the chances of 3+2+5?<n>Output: We are sure the third item is a 7-letter word, but we don’t know what the next two letters will be. So we take 3+2+5 as the first word. We give this word more points than the word with no letter. This increases our total number of points by 10.<n><n>Input: The questioner was looking at the time on a piece of paper and found that, as expected, at 7 PM GMT on December 31, 2015, the time was 7:58 PM. What was the number on the paper at 7:23 PM GMT?<n>Output: If the answer given is 7:23 PM, then the questioner’s answer for 7:58 (a.k.a. 1/9) is correct. But, if 7:23 is correct, then his true answer is 7:30 PM. So the total number of points assigned to the 7:23 PM answer is 200-1=100. So the total number from 1:59 to 7:23 is 2160-1=160. So, assuming that the questioner had an incorrect time on December 31, 2015 by using the incorrect clock on his piece of paper, his correct answer will count as 2160 = 160. Which gives us a combined total of 2160 + 160 = 2400.<n><n>Input:The questioner marked a 9-word list on the white board. Then he read the words to the audience.

Choices:  A: guilty conscience B: fear C: go free D: problems E: find god<n>Output:		I know, Ali, that you did commit murder. Let's go through each of the choices and compare them to each other, to see which one makes more sense.<n>First, the guilty conscience choice. Let's assume that Ali had decided that he did commit murder and wanted to confess. If Ali knew that he was guilty of murder, he would be fearful of what other people would think of him, as they might think that he was being honest about committing murder. So, he would choose to confess to murder. But, what if the guilt that Ali felt caused him to commit murder? This may cause him to feel guilty, and thus choose not to confess. So, he would not choose to admit that he committed murder. So, according to the guilty conscience choice, Ali would choose to be guilty for the following reasons: fear of negative consequences (e.g., his family and community would treat him poorly), the need for a "good" reputation (e.g., people might associate him with the guilty conscience person), and conscience guilt E: because Allah would punish him for it.<n>So the first reason of the guilty conscience choice is because of guilt, fear of negative consequences is the motive for not admitting guilt, and conscience guilt is the justification for a negative consequence. The second reason of the guilty conscience selection would be based on the need for a "great" reputation. So in the first reason of the guilt conscience, it is for fear. But in the second reason, it is because he is scared of what people will think. The third reason of the guilty consciense would be because of having to confess. But, the real reason would be conscience guilt, as he believes that "Allah" will accept his confession.<n>Fourth reason of the guilty conscience is because Ali has a conscience that is guilt-driven. This means that he knows that committing murder would be sinful, but he does so anyway because it leads to a good reputation.<n>That's all three choices, and they all lead to Ali choosing to confess to murder. So, based on the fourth reason, Ali chooses confession to be the only legitimate motive for his confession.<n>That's all four, but since it wasn't Ali's conscience that drove him, I'll only go further and say that he had to confess. So, his reason of fear was gone, and the guilty conscience reason did not exist for him. So, instead of confession being the only motive to choose, it might be that he felt guilty that he committed such an

When Mr. Smith returns, he looks at the clock and makes sure that Freddy was asleep. When Freddy is asleep, Mr. Smith walks out of his office. When Freddy is awake, he tries to sit up in the chair, but then falls back asleep. Mr. Smith tries to stand up, but eventually falls back asleep. Freddy tries to make himself comfortable for as long as possible. But it is getting close to Mr. Smith's bedtime. Mr Smith leaves Freddy in his room, hoping Freddy can wake up again. When Mr. Smith comes back in, he turns on the TV to watch the news and look at the clock. It is about 7 o'clock, and Freddy is asleep again. When the sun sets, Mr. Smith turns off the TV, turns off the lights, and walks out of the room. Freddy is still asleep. But Mr. Smith knows that Freddy will need to wake up soon. When someone arrives in Freddy's room, he tries to get him to stand up, and then falls back to sleep. When someone who is not Mr. Smith comes in, he tries to get Freddy to sit

The man holding the baby is wearing glasses. The children are on the table, the mother is in her chair, the father is in his chair, and the man is on the sofa. What does the man holding the baby have on his lap? Why is the name of the father so prominent on his lap?<n>The father's name is on the man's lap because the woman is breastfeeding.<n>You can get the name of the father by counting the fingers. If you did not already know about that, the man holding the baby is his middle finger, and his wife breastfeeding is his pointer finger. Also, if you count the child's left hand, you will get the fathers name. That is why the man holding the baby's middle finger is the fathers middle finger.<n>The man holding the baby's left hand is not the baby's father because if he is the baby's father and you count the middle finger of his right hand, you would get his mothers middle finger. In a man-child family picture, a man is usually the children's father since he holds the arms of the child and does not have to count their hands. The baby's mother may be holding his right hand, but he is a father to the child because he holds the baby's arms down. This is the same in all portraits, a man is a father to a child when he holds his arms down.<n>So the final guess was the man holding the baby, but the names of his children were his middle finger<n><n>Input: In a group of people, is the person in black the only person who smiles?

Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n>Output:		If we take it as A= getting arrested/detained/intoxicated then C= sober/intoxication and E= pleasure.<n>How many cases of beer could we buy with 600 times the amount of money the person with a budget needs?<n><n>Input:What will be the largest number that increases by 100?<n>Output:If the increase factor is 100, then the answer is 100<n>But we don't know 100 in advance. We need to guess the number first to see what it will increase by.<n>The probability that we get value 100 is 25%. This comes from the following equation:P1 * M1 - P2 * M2 = 100<n>where P1 = the initial total, P2 = the final total, M1 = the initial amount of money, M2 = the final amount of money.<n>But how do we guess P1? This can only be guessed one way. You need to find out whether there will be a price of 1 or a number greater than 1 after it reaches 100.<n>The number of coins in the pack you pull is equal to the number of coins needed to achieve the expected value of the expected output of the purchase.<n>So P1 = 10 = 1, so the estimated amount of money needed to purchase 1 is 10/100 = $1.<n>We can find the chance of P1 = $1 in the following manner. First, we make the guess that 10 times the cost of 1 + 10 times the cost of 2 + 10 times the cost o 3 + 10 times the cost 4 + 10 times the cost 5 + 10 times the cost 6 + 10 times the cost 7 + 10 times the cost 8 + 10 times the cost 9 + 10 times the cost and so on. If the guess is correct, then P1 = $1.<n>Next, we need to test every possible value. This test can only be performed if the number P1 is already found. So, we first find all the possible values of P1 that will not reach $1 after it reaches 100. So that's a total of 36 values of P1 to test. If the guess is right (or the number is greater than 1), then we now only need P1 to satisfy 1 of 36 or 25% of the 36 values. The estimated amount of money that can be obtained is $. This is true of the 36 values that do not satisfy any of the 25% of the 36. So, the estimated amount of money the person needs

It is calculated by multiplying the time spent per day working by the number of hours in a day. For instance, 100 hours per week yields a "total of" 481 days in a year, so 484 minutes can be expected to be used. In the event that an employee works a total of 2,000 hours per year, his total days in a year would be 60 hours. In other words, an employee must work at least 72 hours in a day to maintain the "total of" 484 minutes.

Among them, the family of the victim did something to him. What was that? Choices:  A: knife wounds B: buy a gun C: bleeding D: jail time E: law suit<n>Output:		 We calculate his chances of a reward and of getting a reward for each punishment. All his choices except jailtime were correct.  Thus he got a $4000 reward for each punishment.<n>This was much better than the alternatives: * Knives were used to kill the victim.  * He bought a gun - which would do far less damage to himself and anyone else around him.  * He got sent to jail - probably for 2 weeks.  * He couldn't sell 60 books but 60 books would definitely do.  * He got a reward.  So his chances of all three are better than the alternatives.<n>So the final, more reasonable answer is 400.<n>Input: On Monday, the victim was in a bank having his money changed. His bank account was frozen with $1,000 and the bank decided it needed 60 days before his assets could be released to those affected by the crime.   So they took $10,000 from his account and gave it to the victim's family.  How much money did he lose from the crime?<n>Output: The victims family lost the whole $1,000 and then 60 days of freezing his assets.  So they lost nothing<n><n>Input: On Monday evening, a woman and a man had a brawl on the beach. They were both stabbed and both were hospitalized for weeks. Who got the worse scar?

The man had less damage to his side but both were in serious condition.<n>Output: The woman got worse of a scar.  Since the woman got stitches and the man got a cast, we give her the scar.

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday.

Choices:  A: michigan B: new york C: amsterdam D: venice E: bridge<n>Output:		 michigan (6.44 miles), Amsterdam (4.74 miles) and Venice (1.78 miles)<n>The average water speed in canals in Northern Europe is 0.22 miles/hour. The average water speed in an ocean is 0.32 miles/hour.<n>In a river, the maximum speed is 0.45 miles/hour. The minimum speed is 0.38 miles/hour. The maximum average speed is 0.77 miles/hour. The lowest average speed is 0.16 miles/hour.<n>For a waterway less than 6.44 miles long, it can take 12 seconds to cross. If the waterway is between 6.44 and 4.74 miles long, the average water speed is approximately 0.11 miles/hour. If the waterway between 4.74 and 2.2 miles long is at greater than 8 knots, the average water speed can be up to 7 knots. If the waterway above 2.2 miles of water is under 10 knots, the average waterspeed is 0.3 knots. If the water speed is above 10 knots, the average speed rises to 1.1 knots. If the waterspeed is above 10 knots, it takes 15 seconds to cross a waterway of 2.2 miles. This is very close to the average speed of 3.0 knots. If the water velocity is higher than 33 ft/sec, the speed drops down. If the speed is higher than 90 ft/sec, the water speed increases.<n>Assuming a waterway is at greater than 32 knots, it can be crossed in 5 minutes. For a waterway between 32 and 5.5 meters, it can be reached in 3 minutes. The average water speed is between 0.03 and 0.09 meters/sec for a river. The average water speed for a canal is 0.07 meters/sec. This water speed for a channel at greater than 0.04 meters/second is greater than the water speed of the waterway at more than 0.2 meters/second.<n>The water velocity at a 4.1 and 5.1 meter deep channel is greater than 2 feet/second<n>When the average velocity is less than 3 ft/second and the average channel depth is above 4.1 meters, the maximum velocity is higher than 7.8 meters/second. The water velocity over the maximum channel width (5 meters+ or 2+ meters) is higher than 7.3 meters/second.<n>At this point, water flow slows

Choices:  A: one material often recycled B: ripped C: saturated with water D: one dimensional E: crumpled<n>Output:		 The paper will become stiffer and less rigid, and the paper could curl up because it is already quite rigid when placed in a plastic bag. The paper will lose some of it’s stiffness when placed in the bag, but most of it will remain intact.<n>So the final result will be a sheet of paper with no wrinkles<n><n>Input: If you are a farmer and you have 3 cows, 8 calves, 15 bairs, and 16 steers, then you also have 30 calves. How many days will it take to milk all of your animals?<n>Output: We will also divide the milk daily into the number of calves that are being milked by the steers. So we will end up with 300 days in an all-cow dairy.<n>But we will also make the assumption that the steers are consuming all of the milk every day, so it only takes one cow a day to milk all of them. So we will end with 300/(300 = 30)*32 = 240 days.<n>Since each day of milk is worth 50 cents a day in milk value, multiplying 240 by 32 = 120 = 240 cents. Multiply that by the number of days of dairy that you have, we come up with 240 / 120 = 18.7 = 30.7 days of milk milk per week in which you only milk one cow for 120 dairy days. So this means that the cows need about 90 dairy days to produce milk equal to one pound of pure milk per cow. That is the number of days they need to produce 1.7 * 360 * 1260 = 2.3 pounds of milk per day.<n>So we got 360 days of milk in all-cow dairy from 3 cows, or 12.6 years. So the final milk yield is 483 days of milk each year for 360 cows. So they can produce about 50 pounds of pure milk each day for 3 years, which equals 3 x 36 = 9.5 pounds of milk per cow per year.<n><n>Input: In the year 2005, you bought a brand new car.<n>Output: You bought a brand new car in the previous year and sold it for twice the price of the car you bought a year before.<n>The $6,000 purchase price of the car from 2004 you bought last year is worth $9,700 in 2005.<n>The $8,000 value of the car you sold in 2004 you bought before 2005 that you sold for $10,700.<n>Now we have 3.25 x 24

Choices:  A: in the basement B: west C: solar system D: beach E: beans<n>Output:		 We look for the sum of the square root of the area of A, B and C.<n>If it is 8.75 metres long, B = 8.75 × 4.75 = 17.5 metres, and A = 60 × 4.75 = 24.2 – 24 × 4 = 14 metres, we are left with A = 17.5 × 4.25<n>We can estimate E. Since the area of E is 5.25 metres, and the area of A = 2.5 metres, the area of E is 10.25, and the number of beans in B is 20, we get 20.5 × 3 = 63.25 – 20 = 6.125.<n>This is the area of B, the area of A and E. So there is a 6.125 x 6.125 = 15.5 x 15.5 x 6.125 = 25.5 km away. We can estimate the distance from Boston to this location (in miles) by adding the distance from Boston to E (in miles).<n>We will work with B = 5.25, A = 2.5 and E = 5.25. This comes out to about 35.5 km away, so the distance from Boston to Chicago is about 50 km. Let’s estimate the distance between Boston and this large city ( Chicago ) = 105.25km = 50.25 m. Let’s move the starting point from Boston to this long-distance city by 20 km. This gives us a new starting point: 30.25 km. The new starting point is 5.25 km from B.<n>Total distance for the week: 105.25 km<n>Which 5.25 km is the furthest 5.25 km away?<n>Since B = 5.25 × 4.25 = 17.5 km – (18 + 1.5) = 10 km – 10 = 7.75 km, we can put the starting point 5.25 km from both B and E. We would be at our final starting point.<n>Total distance for week 35 : 105.25 = <<105.25×5.25=33.25>>33.25 km<n>Which 6.125 x 6 = 10.25 km is the nearest 10.125 km?<n>30.25 x 10 = 60 x 10 = 66 x 10 = 2.5 km – 2.5 x 2.5 = 11.5 km<n>Which 6.5 x 6 = 4.5 km?<n>

Choices:  A: running B: have fun C: balls touch D: winning E: get tired<n>Output:		 Without competition, there is no meaning in running, having fun, and balls touching. So there is no hope. If you win, that is the goal. If you lose, it does not matter. You will just have to try harder next time. If someone decides to get tired with each round, you have won. If you had to play without balls touching, there will be no more hope. So there is no chance to have fun, and you could get tired. So the question is: Do you play in this way?<n>So as for the title question, it depends. If it is a family game, all the family members can take turns running without anyone else trying. If it is a game of skill, each person has to win. That does not mean that you cannot lose, but you will not be expected to improve after each loss. So this question is: Do you get tired playing in a family game?<n><n>input answer :1. I have three children at home, they are 6 to 6 years old. Each month my wife gives me four credit cards with a limit of $500 monthly each with no charge on them and to spend as they wish. Each person can have $500 worth of cash in their own account as the limit but they are not allowed to spend it on anything else except their card until it expires. If two children are spending $500 on one credit card, my wife has to make extra payments or call the police.<n>2. My wife keeps my son at home for several months because he is very stubborn when he refuses to follow rules. He refuses to play any game or go anywhere alone and he refuses to have a bath as he refuses to wash his body. We finally had a falling out when he refused to participate in other children's activities and kept telling us that he needs to go home. He is not allowed to have a birthday party because he refuses to have anything to do with a birthday party and this continued on until he refused to be in any of his own birthday party plans. Eventually our wife had our son move back home with the intention to try to get him to make some changes but we failed to use more than $100 a month of his allowance on him and he is still very stubborn. Now my wife and I are having a battle trying to figure out how to pay for all our expenses because he does not pay any attention to his checkbook. He used to be able to write money into his own account but now can hardly use that. He does not

Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n>Output:		 People will walk along the left most edge of the road; they will cross at the front of a line; they will go in two lines that are parallel to each other; they will stand on the side of the intersection closest to the other lanes<n>Input: How are the streets of New York City laid out? Answer: Each road in a certain city is labelled by the two ways it is signalled to travel: north or south. So the road leading from the right lane to the left lane is called north and the road following it from the left lane to the right lane is called south. The roads with the words, north, south, east and west are used to show that the drivers are not allowed to turn right or left: any left turns on a right-hand side street are illegal.<n>Input:A person is in the center of the road. How can one see behind him when he moves across the road? Answer:One look up.<n>Input:Three people are crossing the road at a red light. How many people will they see at the other end of the crosswalk? Answer:Three people will see two people at the other end.<n>Input:Two people are crossing two intersecting roads at a red light. Which way did they go to avoid two cars? Answer:The two cars headed in the opposite direction are now behind them.<n>Output:If the left side of a road is called right and the right side is called left, and a two-lane road has a turning right of way and a turning left of way, which direction should a person travel on the two-lane road following the right or leftmost road?<n>Input:A person riding a bicycle on a two-lane road may ride in both directions at once. The right lane is the right side of the road and the left is the left side. The right lane passes by the first car in the left turn lane. The second car leaves the turn lane and the person riding the bicycle passes by the middle car in the right turn lane. Thus, the person riding the bicycle should follow the right-hand car as it crosses the right-hand turn lane.<n>Input:<n><n>Input:What do students find in an average city roadhouse?

Choices:  A: michigan B: map C: american city D: rest stops E: country<n>Output:		 A: map B: american city C: rest stops E: rest stops F: rest stops<n>There are no rest stops on this expressway.<n>The total number of people crossing this road is: 2<n>Since you need to count how many people enter the expressway per minute, count how many minutes it takes to cross: 2 *(30/12 = 5*30)/5 = 10 seconds<n>Therefore, the estimated time it takes for 2 cars crossing the road is: 2 * (30/12)*(5*30)/5 = 2.8 seconds<n>Since 2 cars are crossing the road at all times, there must be 0 stop lights. Therefore, the estimated time it will take to get from A to B is: 2 * (2 *(30/12)*(3*30)/3 = 3.4 seconds<n>Combining like terms we get: time to get from location A to location B is 3.4 seconds D<n>Combining like terms you get: time to get in from location A to location C is 3.4 seconds E<n>Combining the two terms we obtain: time to get in/out from location C to a town is 3.4 seconds F<n>Combining the two we get: time to cross the expressway is 3.4 seconds<n>Therefore, the total time it takes from C to location F must be: 10 seconds.<n>We can solve the previous problem by using these terms alone: total number of cars crossing the road is 2 * (30/11)/1 = 800 * (1/12)/1 = 2 * (30/29)/1 = 20 seconds<n>The total number of cars that would wait for at least 40 seconds between cars crossing the road is 100<n>Therefore, we have time to cross the road at 40 seconds.<n>Combining like terms by subtracting:<n>The total number of seconds it takes to get into and out of every town is time * 24*5 * 60 = 9.8 seconds<n>If we use the terms alone to obtain the time it takes to cross the road, subtract the time it takes from time to get in and out of a town. That leaves: (time * 9.8 + time to cross) = 6.5 seconds<n>Therefore, the time spent at a rest stop is time * 9.8 + 6.5 = 30 seconds<n>Therefore, the first two times you see a rest stop, that is, you enter it and then turn around to exit, it would

Choices:  A: communicating with others B: hurt feelings C: dry mouth D: intimacy E: changing behavior<n>Output:		 Talking to a person is like talking to them with a person, and a person is like me. The aim of communication is to affect them emotionally. A person has feelings, which can be expressed in the form of anger, happiness, sorrow, pleasure, fear, etc. Emotional effects are the only reason for communication. If you talk to a person with anger in your heart, you are communicating with someone with anger, and it isn't possible to be emotional in such a conversation. The only reason for communication is that emotion changes how the person understands what you are saying. One may never change another persons mind, but one can change the emotion surrounding him. For instance, if you hurt your partner's feelings with a blunt gesture, you are changing his mind about you. The same goes for the other way around. If, for example, you tell her how happy you are with what she says to you on the phone, you are actually changing her mind about you. In that situation, you're hurting her feelings. So, all attempts to communicate, whether emotional or intellectual, are an attempt to influence people.<n><n>Input: An elderly woman was in need of money.

Choices:  A: container B: supermarket C: pantry D: sandwich E: jar<n>Output:		 Put peanut butter in a jar and place an ice cube in. If you put it on a wall, it's cool. Put it on the plate in the kitchen and it's hot. Put it on the countertop and it's cold. Put it in a bag in the freezer and it's frozen. Put it in a refrigerator and it stays cold all year long<n>Subtracting each of the three containers, we find that they have the same volume. If the container is larger than the others, put it in refrigerator<n>Subtracting the volume of peanut butter from another container, we get the volume of peanut butter in that container minus the volume in the other two containers: 400 - 400 = <<400-400=250>>250.<n>So the final solution is 250<n><n>Input: John wrote a letter to 10 people.

She has her car's brake fluid with her and only needs to stop in the parking lot of the school. On her way to school, she says "Good morning!" to the bus driver. On her way home, she says "Hello!" to her parents. How many minutes will it take Alice to run to the bus stop and back home? Output:<n>On her way to work: 3 minutes 1 second<n>On her way to school: 10 minutes 0 seconds<n>On her way home: 18 minutes 47 seconds<n>Since Alice is running late to work, she would need to arrive about 2 minutes before the bus is scheduled to leave work to arrive on time for her usual morning classes.<n>Because Alice leaves work about 11 minutes earlier than the bus, it would take her about 18 minutes 47 seconds to get from the bus stop to her actual work location.<n>Since Alice leaves her home at 6:30 PM, it would take her 7 minutes 37 seconds to run from the bus stop to the building and back home.<n>Therefore, Alice's average daily amount of time spent running in and out of her home is 24 minutes 27 seconds. Since her running time from work is 45 minutes and her running time from home is 36 minutes 35 seconds, Alice's average daily running-time is 36 minutes 54 seconds, more than a minute a day more than her average daily amount.<n>What do you suppose this would mean? It means that Alice is getting an extra three minutes a day in total. If Alice ran 3 minutes 30 seconds faster every day, and ran 4 minutes 55 seconds faster on Sunday, then that would add about another two minutes of extra running-time to her total.<n><n>Input: The following is the value of 1000. The correct answer is shown below. There is a question related to this in another lesson. Tap to see solution.<n>Output: The right answer is 500<n><n>Input: In the city of Sydney Australia three people have access to a swimming pool.

Therefore if we are doing the grooming wrong the answer is that they are not groomed.<n>For instance, if we are shaving the dog's head for a groomer and he has no nail clippers, the answer is that they have not been groomed.<n>We have been conditioned to shave down so that our shoes can get beneath the nails, but if we were not trained to do this we would not.<n>For instance, a dog who gets groomed often gets groomed down the side of the head since this is done. It is not done because we have not been conditioned to do this. It is done because we like to groom the dog, and that is fine.<n>To me, grooming is different than training. I should have a preference one way over the other rather than being trained which is fine.<n><n>Input:What is the average cost of a day of cleaning the carpets in our house?<n>Output:The average cost of the day of cleaning the carpETS in our house is 35.60 euro.<n>In other words, the cost of cleaning our carpets is about 35.60 euros per day.<n>After about 500 days if we are still renting, the total cost of the carpets at the end of the year will be about 2,400 euros.<n><n>Input:The day of the week is Monday, the hour is 9 a.m., the minute is 007 and the second is -7:30.

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n>Output:		 Viruses primarily target the cells that contain a unique string of numbers within their genome. These unique strings change and change and can infect millions of cells at a time. As we already found that viruses can replicate, they also become unstable and can mutate.<n>Since only the cells that contain unique strings of numbers are infected (they are not capable of replicating/mutating), it means that the virus only affects those cells, even though it is able to replicate, unlike bacteria and yeasts, parasites that infect the cells that do replicate. The virus can't multiply since it doesn't have enough cells to do so. Therefore, it could not exist in a complex organism such as a human unless it was modified so that it could replicate, and replicate better. The host becomes immune to the virus, since it cannot replicate, so it doesn't have enough hosts to infect. This results in death of the host.

How long did John have to wait for his mom to answer the phone?<n>Output: Let time = the amount of time it took John to dial his moms number.<n>It takes 10 minutes to dial 8 digits. If John dials 10 digits, his mom should answer his call in 40 seconds because John would have to dial 9 digits. But since he dialed 9 digits, his mom should not answer him for 15 seconds because he would have to dial 8 digits.<n>Thus, John would have spent 3.5 seconds to dial his moms number that took 40 seconds to receive the phone call.<n>Since 5*3.5 seconds is 30 seconds, he would spend 5.5 seconds to call his mothers number.<n>So the final solution is 40 seconds + 3.5 seconds = 60 seconds.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:The little girl was raised selfish, she didn't even care when she was doing what? Choices:  A: crack B: antipathy C: being mean D: disinterest E: unfeeling<n>Output:		 The little girl was selfish because she didn't care about whether her house was clean or not. She didn't care if it had good lighting, or a well-worn set of comforters on the bed. She was content with whatever her bedroom was, whether it was cleaned or dirty, and whether she got along with her mother that day.<n>The child knew that everything she did was for what she wanted to get, and didn't care about the consequences of her actions.<n><n>Input:In the past, they lived in a house where the husband worked full-time and the wife was home full-time. Now, that couple lives in two apartments, which one is more expensive? A: the husband's or the wife's? B: the husband's or her own? C: the husband's or hers? D: same for the other? E: or the same?<n>Output:The husband's apartment would likely cost more. They might even live in one apartment all together.<n>The wife might be more expensive because she is a stay-at-home mother for both children. She is home only when the kids are asleep. The kids would probably never need her all day. However, the cost of childcare would probably only be a few dollars more, at most.<n>The price difference between the two apartments might not be that noticeable. It might not be over $30 -$35, maybe not even $20.<n>So their new apartment in the same building would probably cost them $100 - $110 more, which would result in a difference of $30 - $40. But it would be worth it to them.<n>So the new apartment is probably worth it to them. No problem.<n>The wife's apartment might not be worth it to her. Her life could be pretty much the same as the husband's. Except that they don't have children, so maybe they won't have to pay such high prices for their baby sitters. And maybe she could get more time off when the kids are little.<n>But it's probably worth it to her. It's just one more apartment, not much more work, and probably still cheaper than paying some higher rent.<n><n>#2<n><n>Input:The answer can be seen in the following example of a situation.<n><n>Input:The young man is a businessman in the middle of the week. He can get $100 a day to buy a piece of hardware and sell at a market on Friday. If his customers want only one

To find out which fish should not be touched, the others must touch only those that are dead. We find out which fish is the most endangered so that we do not need to worry. We have 12 fish: 1: Yellow Tang. There are 3 other fish that are endangered. They are not touched by any of the remaining fish. Yellow Tang is the least endangered.<n>So the number of fish that are touched is 2/12 = >> 2<n>Output:<n>All of the fish that touched Yellow Tang die.<n>The total number of fish that touched the other fish is: 6<n>So the total number killed is 6 + 3 = 9<n><n>Input:<n>On the left edge of a chess board, there are 100 open and open-faced squares. Each square is numbered.<n>Now, we place on top of those 100 squares a square with the letters "S". Each square has a color that makes squares around it look like different letters. In this case, the letters begin with the letter "S". We arrange squares so that they form a triangle. At the top of the triangle are 9 squares that each have the letters "F" and "G". We arrange those 9 squares to make a box. Now, we turn that box upside-down so that it looks the same as before. The pieces are still all arranged in a way that makes this box look like it is containing a group of 9 squares, but this time it is filled with the letters "I". The letters on that square are, henceforth, referred to by a number. We know that 9 is the number of squares that we cannot touch because there is a square filled with that number. The pieces on that square are: 5: Diamond Square 6: Rectangle Square 7: Square 8: Square 9: Square 10: Square 11: Square 12: Square 13: Square 14: Square 15: Square 16: Square 17: Square 18: Square 19: Square 20: Square 21: Square 22: Square 23: Square 24: Square 25: Square 26: Square 27: Square 28: Square 29: Square 30: Square

She got a package from her mom of the brown sugary chocolate she so always liked. She put the package on the counter and waited, the candy aisle behind her filled to the brim, but Alice could not find it. She tried several more times, each time getting no luck. Finally, she called Alice's mom. Alice knew her mom went down the candy aisle in search of the chocolate, so Alice's mom did too. Alice's mom knew her mom looked closely, but Alice's mom did not seem to have any luck either. Alice also called in to work asking for more chocolate for Friday. Her supervisor asked her to call back at 12, and to call again when she got off at 2. No such call came after that. At 4, an hour before her scheduled break, Alice called her mom. Alice's mom did not know why Alice's mom hadn't called at 10. She asked her what time Alice had arrived, and when Alice said 2 she asked her to check the back log, but the log did not contain Alice's name. Alice's mom left for a while, but then called again. By 3, Alice had called her mom

He has 5 acres of farmland surrounding his flat. He does not need to buy cows, goats or sheep. His main food is meat and vegetables. How much meat can he keep?<n>Output:The amount of meat that he could keep is dependent on the number of chickens and ducks he has. The amount is dependent on the size of his chicken and duck pen. It is quite significant that he has 6 coops. He could keep between 2,500 and 2,800 chickens or up to 800 ducks. So he can increase the amount of meat this way. It is also quite important that he has a good space for his ducks. So he has an area that could be used for housing ducks and chickens. In addition he will have to have some way of cleaning his pens. So he will need a deep dish fryer, a large freezer and a refrigerator. So he could keep the amount of meat that he would need with 4 large fryers, a large freezer and 2 refrigerators (each about 10 to 14 ft long by 40 to 60 ft in width). So the total amount of meat that he can store would depend on the cooking requirements of his chicken pen. In fact he can store 200 heads of free range chicken in the coops. Of course he cannot use all of the space in the coops and also he has no way of handling the birds and so the number should be limited. So the total meat that he would keep would be: 1,500 – 200 = 800.<n>Output:How many chickens and ducks can we store? Answer: 8 chickens and 200 ducks<n>This is only an approximate estimation with a great many things that we have not considered. However the point of it is to illustrate the significance of shelter.<n><n>Input: A company has a policy that allows pregnant women to take a pregnancy test once every 4 months.

We must find the number of 10% on which there is an excess of 10 people. We find : 100200 = 1 / 10020 = 8<n>So the final answer of 0, which looks like  9 + (9 + 8) = 16, means that there is an excess 9 people with extra 8 people. We find the original number of people in the group  10020 and divide it by 100000 times, to get the new number  200<n>That equals 2<n>We need 10 people in the group to find out, that there is more than 1 person in it.<n>So, the answer is 10.<n><n>Input: Bob has 10 dollars.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Where are you likely to find a professional prostitute? Choices:  A: new york B: whorehouse C: street corner D: corner of two streets E: brother<n>Output:		  B: where you'd expect a prostitution to be A: prostitutes B: in brothels C: brothel D: on street corners<n>(note: we're talking about prostitutes here, but whatever!)<n>We'll ignore the question on where to find prostitutes, because we don't care about finding prostitutes<n>Output:  C: where you'd expect an average prostitute to be A: on street corners B: in brothells C: on street corners<n>We'll ignore the second question, but it's not really relevant.<n>Output:  E: street corners<n>We are still waiting for your suggestions for "C".<n>Output:  The above question was correct, so we now have a new question:<n>Input: Where are you likely to find professional prostitutes?<n>Output:  B): streets. C): places like brothels. D): places like brothells.<n>(You see the pattern, huh? It's the same every time)<n>Output:  B & C are both true. In this case, it might be best to say that A would be likely to be prostitutes. If you're going to pick B, then you need a single question asking the same question, as you already did for "D".<n>Output:  In other words, the correct answer for "Where are you likely to *find* a prostitute?" is B, since that would just be the same question as for "Where are you *likely* to find a prostitute?*A.

He starts eating 30 bananas each day for 1.5 weeks, stops eating when the bananas last for 2 days, and starts eating 30 each day for 3 days. Two more days and he is done eating bananas. He is concerned if he is losing fat. What would you advise him?<n>Output: We add together the total number of banana used and the total number of bananas eaten each day to get the total bananas/day=300.<n>Since bananas have 300 calories per slice, eating 60 slices every day for 4 weeks give us 300/3 = 10.6 Calories per banana<n>Since banana has 20 calories per slice, since 10.6*20 = 1600 calories<n>Since bananas last 40 minutes, we multiply 60 bananas/day=1200 calories divided by 40 minutes=60 calories/hour = 1200 calories/minutes.<n>Therefore this is the final food calorie/day=10.6 Calories per banana.<n><n>Input:There are 5 women attending a movie.

Choices:  A: confusion B: complications C: riot D: arrest E: protests<n>Output:		 Civil action - Introduction: If a man walks into a bank and says: How much is the cashier working? The bank teller will be very confused - the man has no clue as to what means what. (No, it's not a joke) The bank teller may not even know that he is talking to an insurance salesman who just came in for his own account. The confusion may even go on while the person is being dealt by the bank teller. The bank teller is dealing. Confusion.<n>A civil action is not to be confused with a lawsuit - a lawsuit is an action brought in the court of law in a civil court, whereas a civil action is action brought by a person or company to recover money or property from another (either within the company or against a company, or both). A civil action is also not the same as a jury trial; a jury trial involves the process of questioning witnesses to establish the facts. But the purpose of a jury trial is not necessarily the discovery process, although the jury is usually involved in this. Civil action - Explanation: A civil action is initiated by a person. The plaintiff can sue for wrong and a plaintiff is a person who suffers pain and suffering due to the wrongful act or wrongful action. The plaintiff can sue by law or by common law. In simple terms, the plaintiff is seeking to recover a monetary award. That is, a plaintiff's claim is money damages. If the plaintiff wins the lawsuit, the money will be sent to the plaintiff (usually in several installments) or the plaintiff can seek recovery of property - either money damages or property damages. In simple terms, a civil action involves two parties - one party is suing the other for damages and for the victim of the alleged wrong, and the other party is seeking money damages.<n>Civil actions are usually instituted by one party who is in possession of the object of the action; this party must have access to the object to be successful in his or her action. Thus, a civil action cannot be initiated by the defendant or the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant.<n>Civil action - Definition: A civil action is a lawsuit brought by a person who feels wronged or who has suffered any type of loss (e.g., because of an act of violence or injury) against another person.<n>Civil actions are mostly initiated by a person whose complaint is based on a specific person or entity acting against them.

Choices:  A: found B: destroy C: construct D: fix E: produce<n>Output:		 James didn't think further might destroy Jen.  He didn't think further might give him a relationship with her.  But thinking further might do what to something beneficial to either of them. So James did thing A.  Let's look first at what happened.  We find that thinking further might destroy Jen.<n>James thought to himself: I better put Jennifer's feelings first before my own.<n>For example:  I'm going to propose because in the future I think it'll be better for our relationship.  If he thinks it's going to be bad for them, he won't be a man.  If he knows it's going to be OK for them, he won;t be any trouble.  James thought to himself: If it's going to be good for their relationship, I may not think about her feelings at all.  If he thinks that I've already decided to propose, he won't be upset.<n>Then at the time that James was thinking this and doing it, he didn't think further would harm Jennifer.  But he thought further might do what to him.  So instead of thinking that further might be good for Jennifer, he thought further might do whatever to him that she wouldn't want.<n>For example: If I do this, Jennifer might not think about my feelings at all.  But if I do it anyway, then I know for a fact she'll think about my feelings.<n>James thought of all the reasons why he thought of thinking further:  The more I think about Jennifer's feelings, the more I'll think about Jennifer's feelings.  The more I think of Jennifer's feelings, the less I'll have time to think for our own.  The more I'll have to think for Jennifer's feelings, the longer it will take me to be with Jennifer.  The longer it takes me to be with Jennifer, the more I may think about Jennifer's feelings more.  The more I may think about her feelings more, the more Jennifer may feel a connection with me that she isn't comfortable with and doesn't want.  If she feels a connection with me that I don;t want and doesn't want her to; she may lose interest in me.<n>Then James thought of thinking further didn't do Jennifer any good:  I bet Jennifer would be hurt by me thinking further about being with her.  But if I keep thinking of her, Jennifer might get her feelings hurt by me thinking about her feelings.  I bet Jennifer would say not to

If 5,000 potatoes were sold now, each sold at $10, this would raise a total of $8 million. If 5,000 potato plants were planted now, each plant would produce 25 pounds of potatoes, which would feed 1.8 million people for a year.<n>After four years of production, the potato would be worth $300,000, which would pay for the entire planting and production costs and the potato plants could be put back on the market.<n>After nine years, the potato would be so valuable that it would have cost $700,000 to plant and produce, and pay back the debt of $1 million.<n>After 25 years, the potato would have paid back its entire production cost, and would still be in demand for food.

He stopped in a cafe nearby to eat some coffee before returning home. He then rode home, putting down his bike and walking back to his house. He pulled into his driveway, climbed the stairs and stepped into the front door. A gust of wind blew off the patio door, which then cracked and opened. He was surprised to see a rat inside the house, which quickly scampered out. He went into his bedroom, pulled out the phone book and dialed the number of the place where he works. He tried calling a few other places but nothing would ring. He called back the building to let them know they needed to fix the leak in the roof. An hour later Freddy was doing the same thing again, dialing another number to no avail. He went to his boss and complained to him until he eventually had him come and try to fix the problem. He left out an invitation for the boss to join Freddy and asked him to go get some coffee again. As they went out, the boss said that Freddy should bring in some of his co-workers to help. Freddy called several other places. He eventually stopped at Chipotle, which he used to call from on his bike. He went in, ordered some food, paid with a credit card he had and left. He was soon called at his office by his co-worker, who stated that he got off the phone because his laptop computer was dead. He called it back, and after a few test calls, he found that it rang twice. He went in the office and turned it on. He started typing again, and it rang again. This time, he took it out of his purse and tried to call it a third time. The computer gave another message, and he dialed the number on the screen again. Still nothing. He tried calling other nearby phone booths only to be told that they had no network connection. He then went on the second attempt to call the place he worked. The first time he put in his name. The second time he called in his computer's name. Again, the computer said it was out of service. He called back on the computer machine and left a message that he would try again and that the message on the screen would hold

She asked if they were finished, and he said they already were. She asked how long, he said he had to finish one more chapter. How long have they finished since then?<n>Output: This is the story Adam started in class. He finished the first 15 Chapters on Monday, then finished one other chapter on Thursday. He then told her that he had 15 completed on Friday.<n>So the story was finished on Monday, he decided to finish one more chapter on Thursday, and decided to tell her the reason when he got home on Friday.<n>So a full 15 by Friday does in fact take about 3 weeks, not 4 days.<n>So the final story is finished, now he has another 15 chapters to write. He had 15 completed on Thursday, so he can only have finished so many chapters on Friday. He will still need to write 15 chapters on the next week, which means that his story will end on May 10.<n>So on May 10, Adam’s story ends.<n>So the final outcome of Adam’s story is 1.5 years after he started it.<n>So the final total is 2 years, 10 months, and 24 days, 6 hours, and 33 minutes.<n><n>Input: The average number of hours a woman will stay at a job before leaving is about 20 hours a week.

The other presents are gifts that can be used throughout the rest of the relationship, but not necessarily suited for a holiday or engagement gift.<n>Input: Which of these is a bad idea for a business?<n>Output: One that will alienate potential customers and/or lead to bad publicity.<n>Input: Which person are you most like?<n>Output: You are a great admirer of the man whose hand made the beautiful bracelet that you bought.<n>The hand made bracelet weighs 8 ounces. You bought it for $30. It’s the size of a bracelet that contains 50 of the man’s own diamonds. A gift that contains these large diamonds is an ideal gift. However, they cannot be worn unless you wear them everyday, a requirement that will most likely keep you from wearing it, and many companies will not buy jewelry that contains diamonds because they are perceived as “heirloom” pieces. If you have difficulty wearing the bracelet everyday or being with the diamond, it’s not a good gift. This means that it will be seen as frivolous or tacky, and it will create a bad image for the company you are buying from.<n>Let’s say that you are given $100,000 as a wedding gift. What is the most extravagant gift you would receive?<n>Input: The Rolex watch was $150,000.<n>Output: The Rolex watch with diamonds is probably not the most important of all time. It would probably be something of much greater value. The most valuable item in this list is that of $100,000. However, consider the fact that many people are forced to wear diamond bracelets and necklaces even though they don’t have a need for them. So they do not appreciate the fact that they are being forced to wear these kinds of expensive items.<n>Input: If you could buy the car of your dreams, what price would you pay?<n>Output: You didn’t specify the name of the car, so I must assume

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Everybody raised a drink and cheered, they were doing what? Choices:  A: were thirsty B: toasting C: getting drunk D: refreshment E: celebrating<n>Output:		 We look in the bottle. It has 6 liters in the bottom of it. If all 600 empty the bottle, it will take a total of 2000 bottles. Which 3 will be left?<n>Output: Let A = the total number of beer and B = the total number of cans, let c be the total amount of liquid left. Let x = the total amount of empty beer cans. Let y = the total amount of beer cans. If 200 x y = 600 x 200 = 3000, we get 3000 x 5 = 2200. If 5 x 5000 = 25,000, we get 25.000 x 5 = 75,000. Hence there are only 75,000 bottles. Hence, 100 x 75,000 = 150,000. Let us fill the bottle with water to 150 ml per liter, then 60 ml for each half. Then 5 ml per liter for each beer. So the final answer is 1500 ml. Thus it will take 15,600 bottles to fill the box.<n>Output: The finished beer bottle. All 600 beer cans and the 400 water bottles.<n>Input: It’s Halloween. You can’t wait more than an hour before dinner. How many times do you need to feed yourself for dinner?<n>Output: Let a = the amount that you usually have for dinner in a day, B = the amount that you need to feed yourself during dinner. Let c = the amount that you will have when you already ate dinner. Let x = the amount that you normally have for dinner. And let y = the amount of food that you usually eat on a normal day. So let us assume that a 2 and a 2 are not needed for one meal. Then we have enough food for at least two meals. We will eat an average of 2.8 servings a day, but this is too much on a normal day. But sometimes it is sufficient. So let us say that if we have only 2 times that we normally eat, we will eat 2 meals. This is the amount that will be enough for 2 meals.<n>Output: 4 servings in a day for dinner.<n>Input: A table is at least 12 feet long and 6 feet high. What is the height of your head?<n>Output: Lets see how much food is used by a 100 people in a day. Let us assume that a person is able to eat 50 items each day.<n>Output: If our 100 people in the first day eat 50 items each day, they will be eating 150 items everyday

Choices:  A: shelf B: desktop C: cabinet D: kitchen E: cupboard<n>Output:		 After it's dry, the mug comes off the mug in the cupboard.<n>The total number of books for the week is: 80<n>So the total number that must be on the shelf is 80<n>So the final answer for the number of books on the shelf is 80/80 = 60<n><n>Input: At 5 a.m. on Friday, you go running. However, before you finish the half a marathon that you set out to do, you see a woman who is running the full-marathon. She has a dog with her. Her dog is white. The dog is a male. He's 3 to 5 feet tall but doesn't look it. He's wearing a vest that says "Chihuahua." And he walks at a clip of 1 second a minute. It looks like he's never going to lose that vest. She gives him a treat and a high five. He runs at a clip of 11 seconds per minute. It looks like she's never going to lose her dog, either. He's only 3 to 5 feet tall with a white vest. He's wearing a yellow vest with white paws. And he's wearing black trainers. If he ran faster, he could go faster than the dog does. What's his name? ---> (answer right after you read the final answer)<n>Output: At 5 a. m. on Friday, you walk into a cafe and order your coffee but only get a half cup.<n>The total number that must be in the cafe is 40<n>So the total number on the shelf is 60<n>So the final answer on the shelf is 60/60 = 40.<n>The total number on the shelf for the week is 60<n>So the total number sold in the cafe is 40 / 60 = 45<n>The total number that sold in the cafe is 45 / 60 = 40 / 60 = 45/60 = 45/60 = 30 books<n>So we get a 30/30 divide for 45/60.<n>So we get 15 books sold in the cafe during the week.<n>So we get 20 books sold during the week.<n>The total number sold during the week is 30.<n>So at the end of the week, you sell 15 books.<n>So you get 15 books for the week<n><n>Input: Let's say, for one day, there's no work from 8 to 4, but only from 4 to 8.

Alice was able to raise the blind from her Aces to 10s, with a maximum raise of her 6s and 7s. However, Barbara raised her blind each time, and did not call until the Aces were down to 2s. After each hand, we count the number of hands in which the opponent called, and sum the numbers to come up with the total number of the pots. The total number of pots in which Barbara raised was:<n><n>Output: There are 18 pots in which Barbara raises her blind on the first hand, and no pots in which Alice raised her Blind. So we divide the total number of pots by 18, and then add the quotients to get the winner and loser.<n><n>Input:The players A and C were randomly assigned to 1 table, but the other players’ seats were not. To decide who played which hand, we will use some randomization magic for the tables, but we will also determine by hand, which seat will be the one the A’s will play. So Alice’s seat will be called Seat A, and Barbara’s will be called Seat B. When Alice’s turn comes, she puts down her 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 pips from her Ace-7s-Ace combo. Bob then puts down his Ace-7s-King and 8 (plus his 6 pocket kings in his Jack-Ace/Jack-Queen/Ace-King-Shaft position). Barbara puts down her Ace-King, and Alice puts down her Queen. So Alice has played 3 hands, and Barbara has played 6 hands.<n><n>Output:Alice has played 9 hands, and Barbara has done exactly one hand, so we calculate their totals by the following: 100 + 2 / 9 = 33<n>60 + 29 = 37<n>33 / 6 = 7<n><n>Input:The total number of chips in the pot is: 100 + 3,200 + 5,600 + 4,700 + 7,400 + 5,100. Which hand does Alice win on?<n>Output: The other players win on the pot, and Alice will have a total bonus of 5,200.<n><n>Input:Two teams of two players each are dealt three piles of cards one at a time.

The pieces are arranged one on top of the other: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). The white pieces are numbered from 1 through 6, and number one is the first piece on the game board.<n>Note: We look first for a combination of (1, 2, …, 6), followed by (1, 2), followed by (5) and finally by (7).

If two of the cards are duplicates of another of the same suit, for instance, he must discard the card in its unaccented duplicate.<n>Output: To discard a card in an unaccented duplicate, subtract 3 from the two cards next to it. So the missing card is the unaccented duplicate of 6. The total number of cards in the deck would be: 52 + 4 = 53, and a total of 59.<n>The answer is A<n><n>Input: John and his friend Brian are playing a game of billiards. Brian has a 7 ball. Can he sink the 7 ball into the pocket? Can John hit it with a 9 ball?<n>Output: John can hit it with a 9 (the black-white ball) if he hits it offside of the 7. He must hit it with a 7 ball if it is onside. John hit the 7 but did not hit it offside, meaning he did not sink it.<n>If he hit it with a 9, he would sink it. The correct answer, therefore, is YES.<n><n>Input: The ball must hit on the back side if you want it to stick to the board. If it does not, it will break through or be stuck in the center. The ball must pass through the center hole when it lands on the side of the cue ball.<n>Output: Balls must be on the back if they want to stick to the cue ball. The back is the side facing the cue ball. The ball must pass the center hole if it wants it to stick.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:The family was playing cards, what would be a reason for this? Choices:  A: amusement B: losing money C: charmed D: having fun E: win money<n>Output:		 We will add up the total amount of coins put into the game and divide by the total amount of cards placed.<n>Thus: total number of coins = 10 + 100 = <<10*100 = 200>>200 coins<n>Thus, adding up the total value of all coins and dividing by the total number of cards placed, we get: 1000 + 100 = <<500*50=200>>200 coins.<n>Thus, subtracting the total value of all cards from the total number of coins we get a smaller coins, so a bigger card is played. So the final answer is: 500<n><n>Input:On Monday morning, the house was flooded. The water receded during the night and the house was dry by Tuesday afternoon. What was the cause of the wetness on Monday morning?<n>Output: We now look again for the cause of the water on Monday morning:<n>1. The flood is not due to a leakage in the main house.<n>2. The flood is due to a failure in the basement wall.<n>3. The water comes from outside the house, from a pipe or a hose.<n>4. The cause of the water on the ground floor is a water pipe, a pipe in the cellar or the sprinkler system.<n>Input: Tapanga gave her husband 15 pesos for dinner. Her husband bought only 15 pesos worth of chicken for supper and only 4 pesos worth of pork for lunch.<n>So the food that her husband bought was: 15 pesos for food 1, 15 pesos for food 2, 25 pesos for food 3 and 5 pesos for food 4.<n>Output: We will subtract 1 from the total pesos her husband spent. Thus: 14 pesos for food 1 + 1 pesos for food 2 + 1 pesos for lunch + 1 peso for food 3 + 2 pesos for food 4 + 5 pesos for food 5.<n>Thus, subtract the total value of 15 for food 1, 10 for food 2, 20 for food 3 and 50 for food 4 from:<n>14 + 1 = 15 pesos + 10 = 35 pesos<n>So total food spend total 35 pesos<n><n>Input: Tapango gave her husband 5 pesos for lunch, and asked him for another 10 pesos for dinner. What was his answer?<n>Output: We put together the total money that her husband spent by subtracting the amount she gave him for lunch from the amount he spent for dinner and then multiplying them by 5. Thus:<n>35

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:What area is likely to contain a large village? Choices:  A: rural area B: big city C: suburbs D: ohio E: countryside<n>Output:		 We have to look first at the average number of villagers per household in the village. The average village house has 4.8 residents. So how many people are in the village?<n>Output: We need the average annual income of the village; the average income for the year is $10,000. So let's multiply the number of residents by 8 per household. This gives us: 1.65 * $10,000 = $32,000.<n>This means that there are 660 more residents in the village than in the average city, so we divide the annual income by 3 and get this number: 560 * $32,000 = 560 $50,000.<n>Using the same approach we used in question 3, assuming the average income from the village is $100,000, and the average number of residents is 660, the new number is: 560 $50,000 x 10 = 560 $150,000.<n>So the final number is: 560 $150,000<n>This number looks a little higher if you take the average income from the city and add in the income from the village. It would be less if you assumed the average income from the suburbs was $100,000 and the average number of people in the city was 765. So total number is not bad.<n><n>Input: What is the most common car model in Italy?<n>Output: It's not a lot of trucks, it's mainly for a sport car people would sell to their friends as part of their social life.<n>Input: What type of clothing was worn by soldiers stationed in Italy?<n>Outputs: Trench coats, overalls, and winter-wear<n>Output: How often did soldiers smoke?<n>Output: During the World War I there were almost 300,000 soldiers in Italy.

He earns 150 dollars a day. At what rate might the man earn his 150 dollars?<n>Output: I have no idea, the only thing I know is that he may not make as much $ a day working at the shoe store as he does at a restaurant.<n><n>Input: The man who sells the 10 hamburgers in 15 minutes is earning 150 dollars for each burger sold, while the man who sells the 10 hotdogs in 20 minutes is working a job that pays 15 dollars for each hotdog sold. Which of the following is less expensive to the man selling the hamburgers in 15 than the 10 hamburgers sold?<n>Output: I don't know I don't know, the only thing I have are numbers, the only thing I remember is that I can find the man who sells the hamburgers in 20 minutes for less than the man who sells the hotdogs in 15 minutes. Since they work at the same place the man who sells the burgers in 15 minutes would be earning the same amount as the man who sells the Hamburgers in 15 minutes. Since if they bought the same amount of food the amount they earn would be the same the man who sells one hamburger in 15 minutes would sell one hundred hamburgers, and the man who sells ten hamburgers in 20 would sell ten hundred hamburgers; the men who sell a burger in 20 minutes would earn the same amount as the men who sell ten hamburgers in 15.<n>That is correct.<n>Let w = the man who sells the Hamburger in 15 minutes. He sells the burger so that its weight is 300 grams. The same weight of hamburger is sold in 20 minutes, but the manager earns 25 cents.<n>w + 25 = <<25*(300/200)=>3.5 pounds<n>30 - 100 = <<30-100=5.5>>5 pounds<n>So the total weight of hamburger sold is 5.5 pounds, so the total amount of money earned the manager is $0.005<n>So the final answer for the Hamburger in 15 Minute is<n>w + 25 = 20*3.5+125

What year will the Earth enter its next orbit?<n>Output: The Earth will enter a new orbit in 1 year and 5 months.<n><n>Input: 2 people in a train run at different speed. They are separated by a distance of A. What is the speed of the train at which the two people will be separated or the speed which you can expect to be at in the end if the train speeds faster to reach you?<n>Output: Assuming that the train speeds up to equal you, so A = 200 + distance = 2000, then A = 200 * distance = >200 * 10 * Distance * speed = 50 * 1000 = 50*10000 = 100000<n>So the final answer for D, E, F is:<n>D = 5 + 10 * 10 * Distance * Speed = 8 = 3600<n>E = 0 + 10 * 10 * distance = 3500<n>F = 0 + 10 * Distance * Speed * Distance = 3500<n>So the final answer from the above two equations is 100000*50 = >10000 * 3500 = >346090<n><n>Input: 2 cars drive into a train with people standing behind them. Each person gets off 1 car, and takes a different route for their last two cars to keep getting to their destination. How many people do you expect to walk into this train at any point?<n>Output: Given the number of people standing behind the cars, only 60 people should walk into the train at any time.<n>Given the number of people standing near the cars, 5 people should walk into the trains at any time.<n>Assuming both people walk into the cars simultaneously, the number of people walking into the trains will not be too large. So the total number of people passing through the train at any time will not be more than 20 people. Since all the people should get out of the train at the same time, the total number of people walking into and out of the train is 4 + 20 = 80.<n>Output: Therefore, the total number of cars moving in the train is 4 + 80 * 160 = >200 * 160 = 2000<n>So the final answer of this equation is 2400*100 = 24000*1600 = 362020<n><n>Input: The square is 4x3x2x6.

They offer her a few suggestions on different produce. She chooses the cabbage for $1.50. John asks her if she wants to buy more produce and if she would like some fruit. She accepts. He hands her a cart of bananas for $.39 per pound. She decides to pick up 6 boxes of strawberries for $2.99 each. There are currently 12 boxes of strawberries in the produce aisle. When John notices she won't choose the fruit, he tells her that most people don't know the differences between the varieties of strawberries. He tells her that she needs to decide where she is going to be shopping for her fresh food. John suggests that she shop for her vegetables at Walmart or Sprouts. Amber decides to spend her money with Target. She looks around and notices that all of the prices are listed at 20-30 cents cheaper than the grocery store. She goes to the produce section, and picks up 3.5 lbs of carrots, 1lbs of sweet potatoes, 1lbs of apples, and 1lb of strawberries. She goes to the check out line and says, “I will be back.” She does not go to the car to get groceries. She gets off at the other end of the parking lot, buys the groceries, and heads back to her home. She enters the house, and opens the refrigerator. The produce has a “sell by” date of Friday, so she knows she cannot eat any of the strawberries. She begins to pack a few containers for the refrigerator. John comes back into the house and asks her to get into the car because he just got a call from Sprouts. He offers her a fruit cup, and Amber starts walking over to the counter to see if she can get a package of strawberries. John asks her which items she wanted for the cart. Amber walks by some plastic containers labeled “candy.” He points at the box. She quickly grabs a package of chocolate candy. She places her new groceries in the cart and heads out of the store. Her husband asks her if they had finished shopping yet. Amber says that the other items had not been purchased, yet she has not put them into the cart. His eyes grow

The animal has a cage with a glass wall. There is a small hole in the center of the glass. There are eight walls covering the cage. There is a long chain that hangs from the chain hook hanging on the wall above the glass. The monkey is covered in thick black hair. There is one big paw that is longer than the other. In the upper corner is big eye with four small holes in the corners. In the lower corner is little eye with its eye closed. There is a black wire that has been tied to the cage. There is also a leash attached to the leash. I have not seen anyone leave the cage by the glass wall, except when they come to feed the monkey.<n>The monkey is a male. The name of the monkey is Rufaro. He is about 2.3 feet tall, about 30 inches waist and weighs about 11.5 pounds. Rufaro has a black tail. He wears a yellow striped shirt. He wears a yellow tie for the day, but he can eat grass and leaves. He is black. The picture is taken on April the 29th, 2013, in the Tropical Tropical Animal habitat, San Diego Zoo's Mission Valley Zoo. Rufaro is in a cage. The word monkey is printed on the side of Rufaro. There are no doors on the sides of the cage. There are three small windows in the bottom of the cage for ventilation. He has also been named "Rufaro" by his keepers. He was born in December 2006 and has been at the zoo since July 2007. He is an adorable monkey that enjoys his cage. I have taken pictures of Rufaro before I took the picture of him on October the 18th, 2011, at the San Diego Zoo.

The teacher has 300 books on her shelves. The teacher is buying 10 books each day. The average student takes 60 books home with them. So the total number of books she has to buy is 10*60 = 3000. The math is that in a year, the teacher will have 793 books to sell. How many books does she have to sell? We get 700 books<n>Output: The math is<n>10+60 = 3000<n>793+900 = 975<n>975+1800 = 1200<n>1200+1800 = 1200<n>Now let's look at the mall: it has an annual income of $3 billion dollars. It has 10,000,000 square feet. There are 8,000 shops in the mall with a value of $3 million, divided by 8,000. So the value of a store in this mall is $3 million*10,000 = $25 million. So the total number stores in the mall is $25 million<n>Output: There are 3,500,000 square feet of shops in America.

How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Everybody seemed to have a horse not just the regular gamblers, which event always brings out the biggest crowds to the sport? Choices:  A: race track B: kentucky derby C: american southwest D: triple crown E: horse derby<n>Output:		 If we say “horse races are the biggest event in horse betting”, this is true. There is one race on each day of the week that attracts hundreds to the track, the horse derby. Every horse racing event has a big turnout.<n>But what events have the biggest crowds to fill the stands? Choices: - horse races A: track B: derby C: triple crown D: horseshoe<n>Output: Because track racing will appeal to more people, and every horse racing event has more people than the others, track horseshoes are the largest betr of the six horse races we tested.<n>So the final average bet is: 600 / 56 = <<600/56=56>>56/56 = 56 dollars per day for track horseshoes.<n>The average bet in horse racing is around 56 dollars a day, but it is less in the derby and race meeting. The derby draw a large crowd for the horse races.<n>On Thursday when we have the horse meet for the derby, we might think about betting because the average bet on the horses is 56 dollars daily, but the horse meet usually draws a crowd of 150-200 people to the track.<n><n>Input: I would like you to describe what you think the most dangerous place to be in the world is. A. The ocean B. A city neighborhood C. A park D. A jungle E. A cave<n>Output: The most dangerous place in the world to be is on the ocean (oceanic waters): ocean waves, and on a nearby beach (ocean swells): sand storms and waves. On most beach cities, people have sand on their feet, and a strong wave will often wash them away, not always (e.g. the Japanese island of Kyushu), but there will often be sand on their shoes.<n>The most risky part of the city district with high crime is the downtown in the old Soviet cities. There are many young prostitutes and gambling dens, for example they can be found in the following district:<n>Dzhabarovayevsk-8<n>Dzhabarovaya-11<n>Tselyayevo-21<n>Kobrye-5<n>In other districts we did not see this level of high risk, but the danger is the same: the danger is on the streets, near the hotels, restaurants, theaters and nightclubs, while the risk is in the downtown (e.g. in the district of Kobrye).<n>We also

After Sally sends 3,500 dollars to Mrs. P’’s account, a message appears at her account from Mrs. P’ stating that the check could not be cashed because Mrs. P could not receive all the money. If Sally tries again, the message will not appear, so Mary should write another check. Write another check of 3,500 and Sally will send the money to her bank, Mrs. B’s. Write another check of 4,000 to Mrs. B’’s bank, and Sally will receive the money, so Mary should write a fourth check of 6,000. So Mary should have 1 check, 6 checks, and 6,000 total. Write 4,000 checks and get 4,000 total. When Mary writes 4,000 checks, her total earnings is 21,000 dollars and her total income is 27,000 dollars.<n>Output: 1) Sally wrote four checks: 3,500 to Mary, and 1,500 to Mrs.

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: medicine chest C: armpits D: grocery store E: kitchen<n>Output:		 You can use all of the following places to buy deodorant: medicine cabinet: 100 bags 100 cans 100 capsules 600ml bottles 700 caps each 600ml bottles 700 caps<n>If you buy it at the pharmacy, it will cost you 500g; however it will cost you 500/200g = 60g. So if you need deodorant at the pharmacy, you will be spending 60/600g = 7.5 cents each time, so you would need to buy it a minimum of 3 times. You can also buy it at the grocery store: 100g deodorant is sold at 600g/100g = 11 per 100g (which is 1/6 the pharmacy price: 10/$), and 100g deodorants are also sold at 600g/1000g = 12 per 100g (which costs only 10¢ more than a bottle of 1000g): 100g deodorant 1/6 the pharmacy cost: 10/$. This means that you can buy 2 bottles at the same time if you buy from the pharmacy a minimum of 3 times, assuming you buy 30g per bottle. So if you buy it from the pharmacy a minimum 3 times, then you’d need to: 1: buy 30g in each bottle 2: buy 2 bottles together. But in reality, it would be more efficient to buy 1 bottle and make your self. The following graph shows different calculations of how much savings you can get through buying more than 1 bottle at a time. A bottle of 1g deodorant costs 11 dollars from the pharmacy, while 1 bottle at a time costs 11¢ more from the grocery store.<n><n> inputs: 0 to 5 * time * number of days * number of books per day / number of hours of work per day * average hourly rate in $ per hour.<n>Output: The number of books per day is 4.67 hours.

Choices:  A: town B: conference C: bathroom D: theater E: train station<n>Output:		 How many people went to the movie theater (Town):<n>A: 30 B: 60 C: 15 D: 24 E: 8<n>Since the movie theater is a good choice, let's look at the bathrooms first. Let's start by saying the first choice is A. A is the first movie theater in town. So, let's look at A first in this problem. Let's say the person who went to the movie theater was not looking at A, but was actually at A, which means they looked at B and C. Let's look at A first. Let's say the last person who went to A, which is the one who was actually looking at A, looked at C and then went to B and B. The first time A was ever not used is at 0012. Before that, there were 10 people who looked at A and then went to B. There were 4 people looking at A and then went on a train to town E (there was 1 train) and 2 people looking at A and going to the bathroom (there was 0 train). There was 1 train on the way to town E. Let's say the first bathroom in town was at 1000 yards from Town. Let's say the closest bathroom to 1000 yards (the one closest to the train) was at 955 yards from town. So, the only two people who went to the movie on that first week were:<n>A: the first person who was actually looking at the A<n>B: the first person to not use A and then go to town C, where there was an event B that was going on<n>C: the first person to go to Town that wasn't on a train<n>D: the first person to look at the A and not go to B<n>E: the first person to ignore A and go on the train to town E<n>When people use B, they look at A and then go to C. On average, 20 people go to A and go to town C. On average, 10 people go to B and go to town E. If we look at the bathroom last, this is the first time anyone hasn't been looking at the bathroom. So, on average, 15 people don't look at the bathroom either. So, on average 1 bathroom goes unoccupied for each day of the week. There's a washroom for everyone. Let's say there are 3 bathrooms in town. At the movie theater: A: 10 B: 3 C: 30 D: 5<n><n>Input: How

Choices:  A: grocery store B: refrigerator C: freezer D: plate E: supermarket<n>Output:		 For the fridge, we take 50% off that: 300 / 330 = <300/330> 50%.<n>For the freezer, we take 50% of  50 / 130 = <50/130>50%.<n>For the plate, we take 50%/50 = <50/50>50%.<n>In our original question, we looked at the books first. The total number of books are 200 so we multiply each book's book value by 2. To get the sum, divide by 100. That gives us the product: 200 – 100 = <200-100=100>>100 books<n>In our question, we then looked at the remaining books. The total number of remaining books are 100 so we get the sum: 100 – 100 = <100-100=100>>500 books<n>So the final answer for the shopping is <100-100>500 books.<n>For our food question, we looked at all the ingredients first.

So let us take this world and examine how it would play out using a tool as simple as the following: you start your day on Monday at 7:00 am, and continue at 10:00 am. At the end of the day on Wednesday, your time stamp would reflect: 3:00 p.m. So, how long in hours would the day take?<n><n>Input: If your company gives you 50 hours of vacation time a year, how much do you earn if you take the time?<n>Output: When you take time off from work in any given year, your pay is the same as if you worked all year.<n>So the current pay is 50 x 50 x 0.50 x (0.50 x 10 x 0.75 x 0.50 x 0.75) = $50.50 / year<n>So the actual hourly wage is $0.50 x 50 x 0.5 x (0.0 x 10 x 0.0 x 0.1 x 0.1) = $1.25 / year.<n>So the total wage is $1.25 / hour<n>If you go out and buy a new computer, do you pay the new price that was listed on the computer? The price on the screen would be $500. You could not get a half of that price at Half-off.com, which is the closest half-price site. So how much do you get by taking half-off instead of buying new? The actual price, the current price and the discounted price are all the same. So how much do I get by taking half-price instead of new? Since it is the same price, 50 x 50 x 0,50 x (5 x 0.5), 50 x (5 x 10) and 50 x (10 x 0.5) x 0.50 x ($0.50 x 5) = $50.25 / year. So, 50 x (5) multiplied by ($0.50 x 1.25) = 50.50<n>So the wage is still $50 / year<n>If we change the question

Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:The doctor recommended washing hands, what was being promoted? Choices:  A: cold hands B: wet floor C: health D: become wet E: dry skin<n>Output:		 We know that the doctor recommended washing hands, so we need to calculate how many hands should be washed each time she does it. First we subtract hands from the total number of hands she has: 100 + 100 = 200<n>Subtract 100 from both sides, we have: 200/200 = 120<n>Calculating the number of hands each time she does the washing, we get 4.2 * 4.2 = 8.9 * 4.2 = 9.6 * 4.2<n>The final total number of washing hands on average is 8.9<n><n>Input: A patient called the clinic when he was going to be laid up for a few days because of surgery. The clinic asked him what was the primary reason for calling.<n>The patient said that he has a fever of 102 and pain in his chest.<n>Output: A fever of 102 is the primary reason for calling the clinic.<n>The fever is the primary reason for him calling the clinic.<n>So the final total number of days the clinic asked patients to stay on call if they had fever has been 2 days 6 hours.<n><n>Output: How many hours should a person work to pay $300 to his electric company if he lives in the desert area and his rate is 20 cents for electricity?<n>Input: 200 hours x 30 = 600 x 30 = $600<n>Output: We ask the following question: 1 hour - $6 x 10 = $12, or 1 hour - $20 x 10 = $60. So $600 is more than $600. (60/10 = 60/12). So how many hours will he work to pay $600?<n>Input: We do the same exercise: 400 hours x 60 = 600 hours. So 600 x 60 = $1200 and $1200 is more than $1200. (60/36 = 60/12). Thus $1200 = $1200 x 600 = $1800 and $1800 is more than $1800.<n>Output: We write 60/36 = 60/60 = 600/600 = $800 and thus $800 = $800 x 600 = $1200.<n><n>Input: 1 hour = 30 cents $60 = $60<n>Output: We want the answer to the following question:"How many hours will it take for $600 to pay $60?"<n>Input: 1 hour - $600 = 120<n>Output: The answer is 1 hour - 60 cents = 60 cents.<n><n>Input: This is the second question: If you have money that is 20

Choices:  A: grand casino B: large room C: restaurant D: country club E: lobby<n>Output:		 All of the above<n>The key to holding events in an organised fashion is in the location. If you have so many people going to an event that you are spending all your time worrying about where it will be held, you should look for an appropriate venue. It is worth noting that the reception is normally the event's main function, with small groups of guests coming in and out of the event as they chose. The reception is unlikely to last throughout the entire event, so it makes it important not to put too much energy into making it a special event. A good location is probably best for the reception to be held in, as it gives you the chance to do something different. However, it is important to note that the function does not end with the reception; rather, the event continues even afterwards with a dinner or drinks at the end of the event.<n><n> input: "A.A" and "B.B" have 60 candy each.

(Choose only 1)<n>a. Using the ruler.<n>b. Using a calculator.<n>c. Using a scale<n>d. Using a chart.<n>e. Using a tape measure.<n>Output: In order to estimate a person's size, we look at people's heights from the waist up.<n>In order to estimate a person’s height, we need to know how tall that person is and how many inches are in a foot. First we’ll look at his/her neck and head. If the neck and head are equal, he/she is 6 feet. If the neck and the head are 2 inches or less apart, he/she is 7 feet. If the neck is 2 inches or more apart, he/she’s 8 feet.<n>Next we’ll use our height measurement to determine the average height in inches. Then we’ll take the average height in inches to determine his/her height in feet. The feet is just an indication. If the person is very tall, he/she may have feet that are 5 feet, 6 inches tall. If the person is moderately tall, he/she might have feet that are 4 feet, 8 inches tall. If the man is a good example, he may have feet that are 4 ½ feet tall. If he were in the average weight range, he’d have feet that are 5 ½ feet tall. Thus, we can calculate a person's height in feet.<n>In order to measure a person’s body, we take one of his/her feet and measure his body with that foot. If he has long legs, he’s usually tall. If he has short legs, he’m maybe shorter.<n>If a person has a lot of muscle mass, he/she may be taller. If he/she has little muscle mass, he/he may be shorter.<n>If a girl is standing behind her husband, he/she he tall. If a man is standing in front of his wife, he/she he shorter.<n>If a man is standing behind a woman, he’s taller.<n>If

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute.

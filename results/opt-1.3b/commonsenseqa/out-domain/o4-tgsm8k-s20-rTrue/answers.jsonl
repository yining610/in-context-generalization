On Sundays, his family would travel by boat to hang out together. The boat had a life jacket as a safety precaution. How many times did Dario not see his family?\nWhat did he do? He just missed them each week. If not for that, the boat would be damaged. Dario got upset but then he just didn't see them when they returned.\nHow long until he got used to driving by the bridge?\nHow much trouble or annoyance did it cause him?\nHow long did it take him to drive to the bridge?\nOutput: 20 weeks (8 weeks = 80 weeks).\nDario's family drove to the bridge every Sunday. So a lot of people drove by the bridge every week.\nThe maximum delay between seeing his family on Sundays and getting them back on Sundays was a year (or one year for a boat).\nWhich makes him 2 months late about spending time with them.\nOutput: 2 months\n\nInput:Dennis is a construction worker. One of Dennis' neighbors used to own a boat and his wife drove him to the bridge. Dennis' neighbor said that Dennis' boat was damaged a month ago by a beaver. Dennis had a chance to fix the damages.

The function used to do this is the simple x-intercept function. However, its value is actually equal to the difference in percentage between how many numbers were added together and subtracted together. For example, imagine that the function can be rewritten as simply the sum of all the numbers multiplied by the squares of one side. This is what we get:\nInput: The graph       =\nOutput =\nFor some point in   5 = 5 * log 2(log 3(log 5(5)) + 5 * log 10(log 5(5)), where log is the logarithm of the number, log(5) is the logarithme of an integer, and the square of the sides is 5. Since all five factors are the same number, the expression 1 + 5 = 5 is exactly right, so \"Log\" is right.\nOutput:\nInput: 5 * log 3(log 5(0)) + 5 * log (log 5(1)) + 5 * log 0(log 5(4)) + 5 * log 1(log 5(3)) + 5 * log 2(5)) + 5 + 5 + 5 + (5 * log 2(0))) + 4 * log 1(0) + 5 + 5 + 2 * log 1(0))) =\nInput: 5 * (log 4(0)) * -5 * log 5(1) * 5 > 5 * (log 2(0) + 3 * log 0(log 2(x))) + 5 * log 4(1) + 5 * log 5(0) + 5 * log 1(-log 1(log 5(x))) * 5 - 5 * log 2(0) + 4 log 1(0)) = 5 log 1.5 log 2.5 log 5.\nInput: 5 log 2(0) / 5 log log x = log -1 log log x\nOutput: Log -1 means that the value of 2 / 5/2 is log x -1.

When the boy gets home, he shows off one of the dogs, and when he runs away, the other dog follows. When he comes to work, he has the other dog on a leash so he doesn't get into any trouble. When he is trying to get the other dog to sleep, he puts each dog in her new cage and puts them into their respective beds so they can't run away. When they sleep, each dog puts her paws on the other one's collar. When one of them starts to get mad at the other, she puts her paws on the collar and she walks away without getting yelled at. When she does get mad at the other one, she puts her paws back on the other's collar. How often does this happen? How long does it take?\nOutput: 1 day (2+2)/(7+7)/3 = 5 minutes (2 / 4)/(21 + 23)/3 = 30 minutes or 15 minutes per week per dog.\nThere were 5 animals in each cage.\n\nInput: Jane lived with her boyfriend.

{"text": "A  B  C  D  E       S\nThe number of seats for the auditorium would have 50 people, with another 200 or so seats in the synagogue and 500 in the church.\nBut only 50 people in each room. So we have to consider the extra seats. Then we must consider that both the auditorium and the synagogue have seats for only 50 people each, and that there are 1000 people in the church. Then finally we consider that the auditorium seats have half the number of people that the synagogue and the church seats have respectively.\nThe extra seats for each religion total 600, so we have 600 * 50 * 1000 = 6000. Because the total number of seats in the auditorium is only 50, we have 100* 50 * 1000 = 2000 * 2000 times 1000 = 4000 * 8000 = 10000 people. The total number of people in each room is 10000. Therefore we can not find a place, that there is room for 4000 people. So none.\n\nInput: We have 1000 books on our desk  The total number of books is 5000. The total amount of money we have at our desk is $6000. If we take out another 5000 book from one of the books on our desk, how much money would we have left at the end of the week?\nOutput: The total money we have at our office is $6000. So we can add $6000 to the money that we have left at the beginning of the week.\nThe total amount of money in our office now is $6000 = $6000 + 5200 = $6200\nSo we can add more than $6000 to the money left at the beginning of each week when we take out more books. So we can add more than 6000.\n\nInput: There are 2 seats in the auditorium for the religious service. A: Auditorium B: synagogue C: confession D: confession\nOutput:  A <=> Auditorium <=> synagogue <=> confession <=> confession <=> synagogue <=> auditorium <=> church <=> confession <=> auditorium <--- all.\nThe number of seats in the Auditorium would be 20\nThe numbers of seats in each room would be: 20 * 2 = 50\nThe number of seats to the left of the auditorium would be 100\nThe number of seats left will total 20 * 50 = 100\nSo the total number in the auditorium is 20 * 50 = 70\n\ninput: We have a room with 10 seats", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

T-Mobile was one of the first companies to begin offering this service. B: It cost them $9.99 per month to offer their service. T-Mobile charged the customer only two different fees per month to continue their free service: 1-2 minutes of roaming calling from a land line, and 2 minutes of roaming calling from an email. They offered unlimited minutes of domestic and international roaming calling, but the cost of their service dropped from $9.99 to $4.99 per month with a two minute restriction added to each. So the customer could receive calls from anywhere without the cost of international rates. If T-Mobile was not charging international rates, then the customer should still have been charged 2 minutes of roaming using their free service. (If T-Mobile was charged the same amount of international calls when sending or receiving calls as they were in the same state as the caller or the number they were calling from, then the customer should have used their free roaming time as a call credit, which increased the cost from $9.99 per year to $6.99 per year for the customer.) This means that if 100 million T-Mobile customers started using this service, they would pay only 50% of what they would normally be charged for their first year.\nSolution: A: 1,400,000,000 lines were added, but for 6 cents per minute of roaming.

He's fed with breast milk and then at night is pumped full of formula. If he is fed every 2 hours at night, for 24 hours, his body stores up 50,000 calories. He's 2 hours old when his body stores up 150,000 calories. How many hours does it take to fill up 2 bottles of breastmilk for a baby?\nOutput: 2 hours.\nSince we know that a 2 hour old baby weighs 20 pounds, then a bottle fills up 20 pounds, which is 20 x 0 or 12 ounces.\nIf the bottle fed one pound weighs 75 pounds, the number of bottles it takes to fill it up is 225.75 or 5.75 ounces.\nSince it is 1 ounce for each bottle and 375 for each 2 liter bottle, it takes 3 cups or 3.25 gallons to fill 2 bottles for a 2 year old, for 48 hours.\nThe number of times a 2 year old can be fed a bottle of formula is 480 times, which is 2.5 litres in 3 gallons.\nTotal is 480 + 480 = 960 litres: 960 x 0 = 960 litres = 1,000 litres\nIf he were fed all day long, for 4 days, the amount of calories he stored up is 900,000. The amount of energy it takes to turn 9 ounces of breastmilk into 900,000 calories would be: 9 x 1800", "answer": "A: sights"}

Then we take the answer from the following table. The first child is born to father who has a different name to the father of the second child. (We do the same for the second child, but we don't do the same for the third, fourth or fifth child). We can't check children's ages separately due to the way we want to do the calculations. Therefore we assume that A and B are the same, C is older than the three youngest children, D is between the youngest two and the oldest. We take the answer from the table. The first and second child (father and daughter) have the same names; however, A was born to the father of the daughter first child. The second child (father and son) has the same name as the first child; however, his father (the one in blue) is not the son of the first child. Therefore, his father would be older than the first and second children. The third child (father and daughter's father) does not have a similar name to the father of either of the other two children that we see on the list: they have different first names. Therefore, he is not elder to any of the children. Therefore, the third child has the same age as the first daughter (his age). It's impossible to calculate the ages of the first two children by dividing the ages of the second two children because the ages of the mothers don't appear on the list. Therefore, we can't see the ages of the children individually. Instead, we assume that the first two children are the same.", "answer": "D: attractive appearance"}

The first problem has to do with a real number and not being able to divide it. Let's look at a number in some number of numbers. For now we will assume a real number is a number of 3's and a number of 2's. For example a real number could be 3.1213. Let's say that this real number of 3's and 2's is 3.121334. In this case if the real numbers are of the form 1.7, 1.7, 1,1 then a real number can also be three of three's and three of two's. This means that each real number can be the same as two real numbers of the form 4.121334 + 3.121334 + 5.6.121334 + 6.6 12.121334. etc. This means that each number can have a whole range of the same real numbers, which means that each number can be 1 to 1.2, 5 to 5, 8 to 8, 15 to 15, 27 to 8, etc. This may all sound complicated but it really isn't. Here is a handy little rule I have learned by reading lots. Every real number of 3's must have an infinite sum and every real number of 2's must have an infinite divisor.\n\ninput: 1.6 3.5 2.6 0.5 =<<1.6-3.5-2.6-0.5>>> 1.6 3.4 3.5 3.5 1.3 =<<1.64-3.5-3.4-0.5>>> 2.4 3.3 2.3 0.6 1.2 =<<1.944-3.5-4.4-0.6>>> 3.3 2.1 1.0 0.6 1.1 =<<3.619-4.4-3.2-1.0>>> 4.2 3.0 3.1 1.3 =<<4.2327-3.2727-3.0-0.6>>> 5.0 3.3 2.2 0.6 1.15 =<<5.2035-3.2035-3", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

Darlene has $1,000 left in savings, $1,000 in bank, and $2,000 in personal debt. Darlene\u2019s bank and personal checking accounts have balances of $150 each.\nOutput: Give the total amount of money. We get $2,100, or 100 + $150 = 10110.\nThe person\u2019s income from work has increased by 60%, but the person\u2019s expenses have increased by 40%. With a $100 difference, Darlene is earning 1.00%, while the person is losing money by 50%. Thus Darlene has gained $100, not $1,000. Thus Darlene does not have 100 extra dollars, and the person does, indicating that the person has 100 extra dollars. Thus 100 + 10110 = 10110\nIf the $1,000 is not in her checking account, she cannot make payments. The sum in savings, then, must go into the checking account. The bank has no funds. The bank is being insolvent. If the person can pay the bank her mortgage interest, it will provide the sum that is in savings. She must pay that sum by purchasing goods or services. The total sum of all products and services she is able to purchase is: 10760 + $150 minus $150 = 10710, or the total of $2,100. Thus the total sum of all goods and services she is able, with $2,100, to buy is: 10760 - $150 = 10710. With the $150 in savings, the total sum of savings is 10710 + $150 = $21710. Thus the total sum is increased by $10760. Her debt from personal loans has almost doubled. Thus this total sum of savings must be paid, but with a total sum of $2,100, the sum of all goods and service a person can buy will drop", "answer": "C: own family"}

Alice took about 7 minutes on her one way out of work. This is faster than the other way. But it is 7 minutes more work. This means that she spent 2 more minutes working than she needed to, because she took longer to get to work by the one way route. So Alice spent 4 minutes more traveling one way, than she needed to. So in total, the two routes are equivalent, as long as she had taken the same amount of time traveling both ways. But in this case, she has taken twice as long for work by going the way on the right as the way on the left. Therefore, she has wasted two minutes traveling the extra mile. So Alice has wasted 2 minutes and 37 seconds for the extra mile on this one way ride. She has taken 3 minutes and 55 seconds longer by going the way on this one way, than when using the other way.

How many balls will their teammates catch?\nOutput: You need to subtract 3 balls from each team\u2019s total count of balls. Then divide each team\u2019s ball total by 3, and multiply by the number of players on each team to get a total score. You also need to divide each team\u2019 score by the total number of balls they are able to catch.\nIf 3 balls are passed from team A to team B and 3 balls are caught by team B, team A\u2019s score is 40 + 3 = 60. So the score is 60/3 = 60 and Team B\u2019s score is 110 + 3 = 140. So they have completed all 100 balls.\nIf 3 balls were passed from team A to T and 4 balls were caught by T, team A has completed all 200 balls, meaning Team A has completed 10,000 balls. Team A has completed 10 times 8.4 = 112 balls. Team T has completed 0 times 100 balls. So they both have complete 2.25 balls less than Team A.\nTeam A has completed 4,150 balls.

So what about two people who are not happy because they are happy? How can they be happy?\nOutput:  We add the total number of times that they are not happy to the total number of times they are happy (and they are not happy): [1] + [(1 \u2013 their own unhappiness) / 2] = [2 times their unhappiness + 1 \u2013 their happiness] = [(2 \u2013 their unhappiness + 1 + their happiness)] \u2013 [(100 + their unhappiness) \u2013 [(100 + happiness)] \u2013 [(100 - unhappiness)] = [(200 times their unhappiness + 100 times their happiness)]\nOutput: [1] + [(100 + their unhiness) / 2] = [(200 times their happy + 100 times their unhappiness)] + [200 times their happiness + 100 times their unhappiness + (100 - unhappiness)] \u2013 [(200 times their unhappiness + 100 times their unhapiness)] = [(200 times unhappiness + 100 times unhappiness) + [(200 times unhappiness - 100 times unhappiness]) = [(200 times unhappiness + 100times unhappiness + 100 - unhappiness)] = 8.25\nAs we can see, we have added 8.25 + 8.25 + 2 + 1 = 11.75 + 11.75 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 15.25\nAdd 2+2+2 +2+2 +4 +5 +3 = 20\nAdd 4+4 +4 +4 +5 +4 +5 = 30\nAdd 5+5 +5 +5 +5 = 40\nAdd 6+6 +6 +6 +6 = 60\nAdd 6+6+6 +6 +60 = 100\nAdd all the numbers together: 40 + 60 = 100 + 100\n\nInput: A person is trying to find his/her family photograph.

It has a value of 500,000 points. She spends 500,000 points on various items each month for her home and personal use. If the employee\u2019s spending was to be reduced to half what it is now, how much total would each of the items have to cost for her to spend half of what she currently does?\nOutput: Let\u2019s pretend the bill of exchange is a fraction of the actual amount of 500,000 points, let\u2019s assume it is 1/2, and let\u2019s also assume the points are the same as her spending. So the actual amount of spending will be: 1/2 * 500,000 + 100,000 * 500,000 = <<1/2*500,000-100,000-500,000-500,00-.25>>125,000 points. Now her spending will be: 1.125 * 1/2 = <<125,000-500, 00-.25>>125 points. How many points would she spend if she reduced her spending to: 1/125 * 0.25 = 500 points.\nSo her spending would be: 1.125 / 0.25 = <<500 points >>500 points\n\nInput:On Tuesday, the school was closed because there was no student present.

Then the choice that he made in his first journey will be wrong.\nSo in the end John travels the route of the highway. He ends up in his desired destination, which is California.\nIf John used the highway instead of walking on the dirt road, he would end up in his destination in Mexico on his first journey. Then he would later be able to go North again after arriving in California because after exiting the US he would have reached Mexico.\nIf John decided that he wanted to take the highway from Mexico to the united states, he would be able to reach Oklahoma on his third journey and head North instead of on the dirt road toward Louisiana. John then could eventually reach Louisiana on his fourth journey from Oklahoma. After arriving in Louisiana, if John traveled along it North, he would reach Arizona, then Arkansas. After getting to Arkansas on his fifth journey, if he travelled along it North towards Florida the route that John used would be wrong, because Florida is already in the United States.\nThis answer is incorrect. John wouldn't be able to reach Louisiana on his fourth or fifth journeys because by that point, Louisiana has already had a history of being in the United States. So the answer is D. At first, John would be able to hit Arkansas, then Florida. However, his fifth journey would be wrong because that also would have included Alabama. So the answer is E. When John wants to hit Arizona, he will have a better chance at reaching the Arizona than he did when he started his journey.\nThe correct answer is B.

Since this figure is a lot different than most countries' population, India should be getting a very large number of immigrants since their birth rate is the lowest. But these immigrants are still not able to take up any of the population, which is decreasing. Can you explain why this is?\nOutput: In many countries, the proportion of the population that is below the age of 50 is much higher than 50%. This is because of a great deal of infertile married couples. These couples tend to have fewer children because their fertility rates are not high enough. These couples are also in a small number of couples who get married. This number becomes quite large when the total number of persons becomes 5,500 million. Therefore, most of this immigrants are people of other age groups, since they have more children than the women in their families will bear.\nInput: The planet is getting very small in the near future. The population will not be able to contain the population. There will be a great increase in the deaths and therefore the total human population is increasing. Therefore, a large number of immigrants will be coming from the other side of the earth. India is the top destination for these people. India is being taken over by many immigrants. Will all of them be allowed in?\nOutput: Indians are generally very accepting of their foreign colleagues. They are ready for any race, color, disability, and religion. In spite of the economic downturn, Indian people are very optimistic, open-minded people. They are extremely trusting and friendly. They will be the ones coming to India. Many people from other countries will be able to assimilate into our culture, and will be welcomed.

He walked into a lumber yard.  After buying a saw, he walked further and further away down the road to find a piece of timber. After 45 minutes of walking, he found a piece of timber.  He walked again back to the yard for more wood. He would walk for 3 more hours before he finally found a piece.  He bought a box of tools in case he needed to buy further wood. Once he had all the tools with him, he went back to the yard, where he had already seen other wood.  He had purchased all the wood he needed to build a new fence, but he knew that he would need more before he could build the fence.  He walked for two more hours before he found a piece of wood. After walking for five hours to make money building a fence, he got home. He built his fence, and later bought a home.  He made so many trips to the store for tools and wood that he would often buy more wood and tools, making himself travel longer distances to get more wood and tools. The more times that he went in stores looking for tools and wood, the taller his profile got, the more money he earned, and the more people he talked with.  The more times he went in stores looking to buy tools and wood, the more wood he got from the stores. The more wood he got from stores, the bigger his family got. The more people he talked with, the funnier they became, because if they understood each other better, they would be more willing to help him solve everyday problems. So his answer is B\nBobby was looking for wood in different stores, searching for pieces he could buy at two yard sales.

The soft drinks he sells are expired.

It is, therefore, fair for the company to expect him to reimburse them for some portion of his cost.  The amount is not very much, but if he is willing to pay for the full purchase, the burden is fairly minimized.  For example, even if he uses half of his purchases and gives the balance to the company, it would be fair if the company gave him $50 per use.\nOutput: 2 months + 30 days = 60 days\n30 days * 30 = 120 days\nSo the customer will have used 60 times his purchase amount in 30 days.  If he leaves the balance unused for the rest of the 30 days, he is unlikely to have a problem.\nOutput: 120 / 120 = $600\nSo the customer will pay $600 per month for soft drinks for three years.\nOutput: 300 / 30 = $1,000\nSo the customer will be responsible for paying $1,000 in three years.\nOutput : (15-60 x 600 * 300 ) = 2,500\nOutput : (150 x 1200 ) = $1200\nSo the customer will spend 2,500 on soft drinks.

The total number here is: 1:44 * 5 = 0:46 * 6 = 0:46 + 0 = 3:30 * 12 = 19:55\nOutput: We have to use the 0's and 1's from the 5 and 6 digit number when working with the time.

They are at home so they sell 100 on the market for 50 per candy. They buy 100 more on the first day of school so they sell 50 per candy.\nTo sell 100,000 each day they buy 150,000 candies from other students. On the first day of school, they sell 400 candies. On the second day of school, they make 400 candies. On Wednesday they sell 400 candies, Saturday they sell 10,000 candies, Sunday they make 10,000 candies.\nHow much money did they make on the second day of school?\nOutput: If they sold 400 candies for 150 cents each and made 400 per period that would be $2,000. They could only sell 600 candies on Wednesday, so they are only half as rich, but they spend their 50 cents on the other candies so they don't lose money!\nOn Wednesday they spend their 50 cent candy and on the fourth period they spend the rest of the 1st period. They had to sell 200 candies to earn the same amount as 100.\nSo, the total they made on the first part is:\n$4,000.00 / 400 = $150.00\nThey can't sell any more candies on Wednesday so they need to sell 600 candies per day to earn the same as 100.

But, if 7:23 is correct, then his true answer is 7:30 PM. So the total number of points assigned to the 7:23 PM answer is 200-1=100. So the total number from 1:59 to 7:23 is 2160-1=160.

{"text": "I know, Ali, that you did commit murder. Let's go through each of the choices and compare them to each other, to see which one makes more sense.\nFirst, the guilty conscience choice. Let's assume that Ali had decided that he did commit murder and wanted to confess. If Ali knew that he was guilty of murder, he would be fearful of what other people would think of him, as they might think that he was being honest about committing murder. So, he would choose to confess to murder. But, what if the guilt that Ali felt caused him to commit murder? This may cause him to feel guilty, and thus choose not to confess. So, he would not choose to admit that he committed murder. So, according to the guilty conscience choice, Ali would choose to be guilty for the following reasons: fear of negative consequences (e.g., his family and community would treat him poorly), the need for a \"good\" reputation (e.g., people might associate him with the guilty conscience person), and conscience guilt E: because Allah would punish him for it.\nSo the first reason of the guilty conscience choice is because of guilt, fear of negative consequences is the motive for not admitting guilt, and conscience guilt is the justification for a negative consequence. The second reason of the guilty conscience selection would be based on the need for a \"great\" reputation. So in the first reason of the guilt conscience, it is for fear. But in the second reason, it is because he is scared of what people will think. The third reason of the guilty consciense would be because of having to confess. But, the real reason would be conscience guilt, as he believes that \"Allah\" will accept his confession.\nFourth reason of the guilty conscience is because Ali has a conscience that is guilt-driven. This means that he knows that committing murder would be sinful, but he does so anyway because it leads to a good reputation.\nThat's all three choices, and they all lead to Ali choosing to confess to murder. So, based on the fourth reason, Ali chooses confession to be the only legitimate motive for his confession.\nThat's all four, but since it wasn't Ali's conscience that drove him, I'll only go further and say that he had to confess. So, his reason of fear was gone, and the guilty conscience reason did not exist for him. So, instead of confession being the only motive to choose, it might be that he felt guilty that he committed such an", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

Michelle was paid $100 a person for the dinner party. Freddie was paid $50 a person for his own dinner party. Freddie's party cost: $100*50*100 = <<$100*50*100=200>>200\nMichelle's party cost: $50*$100*$100 = <<$50*$100* $100=300>>300\nTotal cost of the dinner party was $200\nBut to complete the set, Freddie and Michelle were paid separately $50 each.

In the afternoon he goes to work at the food court, then comes home to do homework at night. How much money does Freddy make from working 5 hours each shift?\nOutput: The average overtime in the month is $200, so Freddy earns $200 in overtime per month.\nThe figure is 200 because we take Freddy's yearly salary and take out vacation pay, then divide by 5.5 hours. Because Freddy works five hours overtime each week, that works out to be ~$200 monthly\nA five-hour overtime is ~$200 less than an 8-hour overtime.\nSo this means that the average weekly wage for Freddy is: $80\nSince this is Freddy's annual salary, $80 / 5 = $280\n\nInput:Freddie works a 5-hour night shift.

The man holding the baby is wearing glasses. The children are on the table, the mother is in her chair, the father is in his chair, and the man is on the sofa. What does the man holding the baby have on his lap? Why is the name of the father so prominent on his lap?\nThe father's name is on the man's lap because the woman is breastfeeding.\nYou can get the name of the father by counting the fingers. If you did not already know about that, the man holding the baby is his middle finger, and his wife breastfeeding is his pointer finger. Also, if you count the child's left hand, you will get the fathers name. That is why the man holding the baby's middle finger is the fathers middle finger.\nThe man holding the baby's left hand is not the baby's father because if he is the baby's father and you count the middle finger of his right hand, you would get his mothers middle finger. In a man-child family picture, a man is usually the children's father since he holds the arms of the child and does not have to count their hands.

{"text": "If we take it as A= getting arrested/detained/intoxicated then C= sober/intoxication and E= pleasure.\nHow many cases of beer could we buy with 600 times the amount of money the person with a budget needs?\n\nInput:What will be the largest number that increases by 100?\nOutput:If the increase factor is 100, then the answer is 100\nBut we don't know 100 in advance. We need to guess the number first to see what it will increase by.\nThe probability that we get value 100 is 25%. This comes from the following equation:P1 * M1 - P2 * M2 = 100\nwhere P1 = the initial total, P2 = the final total, M1 = the initial amount of money, M2 = the final amount of money.\nBut how do we guess P1? This can only be guessed one way. You need to find out whether there will be a price of 1 or a number greater than 1 after it reaches 100.\nThe number of coins in the pack you pull is equal to the number of coins needed to achieve the expected value of the expected output of the purchase.\nSo P1 = 10 = 1, so the estimated amount of money needed to purchase 1 is 10/100 = $1.\nWe can find the chance of P1 = $1 in the following manner. First, we make the guess that 10 times the cost of 1 + 10 times the cost of 2 + 10 times the cost o 3 + 10 times the cost 4 + 10 times the cost 5 + 10 times the cost 6 + 10 times the cost 7 + 10 times the cost 8 + 10 times the cost 9 + 10 times the cost and so on. If the guess is correct, then P1 = $1.\nNext, we need to test every possible value. This test can only be performed if the number P1 is already found. So, we first find all the possible values of P1 that will not reach $1 after it reaches 100. So that's a total of 36 values of P1 to test. If the guess is right (or the number is greater than 1), then we now only need P1 to satisfy 1 of 36 or 25% of the 36 values. The estimated amount of money that can be obtained is $. This is true of the 36 values that do not satisfy any of the 25% of the 36. So, the estimated amount of money the person needs", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

What does that tell us?\nOutput: We use the equation for the number of extra candies, y = y + (x + 8 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 13 + 13 + 34) * 100/200 = 66 candies\n6:15AM\n\nInput: Steven (Aldridge) did work for about 6 hours each day, and worked 2 hours each day on Saturday. He went to school every day for 3 years and took 4 part-time jobs last summer to pay for college. How many hours were Steven working at school on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday?\nOutput: Steven worked for about 6 hours each of the first 4 days of school. He worked 2 hours each of the others days. Therefore he worked: 6 = 24, meaning he worked 24 hours.\nTherefore we can find that Steven worked for about 12 hours on his hobby in the first 4 days of college.\nTherefore the final answer is 24 hours\n\nInput: Steven had a job of 16 hours per week at a supermarket. He gets paid $9 per hour. Let's say he pays taxes at this rate. He also receives $900. He spends $3,900 during the month. What is the difference?\nOutput: Let f be the fraction of his income that he spent on food and drink. If he spent this $900, he would not have $900 in his bank account.\nLet f = (($900 + 990) / 16) / 48\n48 = $12.42/hour\n$1200 = $60 per week over the four weeks\nTherefore Steven worked $2,920/week or $2,400 per week. So he spent $1,040.\nTherefore the final answered is: $2,400\n\nInput: On Monday night, Joe and his wife left to go to their friend's house in Florida. Their 15-year-old son asked to join them.

How many days will it take to milk all of your animals?\nOutput: We will also divide the milk daily into the number of calves that are being milked by the steers. So we will end up with 300 days in an all-cow dairy.\nBut we will also make the assumption that the steers are consuming all of the milk every day, so it only takes one cow a day to milk all of them. So we will end with 300/(300 = 30)*32 = 240 days.\nSince each day of milk is worth 50 cents a day in milk value, multiplying 240 by 32 = 120 = 240 cents. Multiply that by the number of days of dairy that you have, we come up with 240 / 120 = 18.7 = 30.7 days of milk milk per week in which you only milk one cow for 120 dairy days. So this means that the cows need about 90 dairy days to produce milk equal to one pound of pure milk per cow. That is the number of days they need to produce 1.7 * 360 * 1260 = 2.3 pounds of milk per day.\nSo we got 360 days of milk in all-cow dairy from 3 cows, or 12.6 years. So the final milk yield is 483 days of milk each year for 360 cows. So they can produce about 50 pounds of pure milk each day for 3 years, which equals 3 x 36 = 9.5 pounds of milk per cow per year.\n\nInput: In the year 2005, you bought a brand new car.\nOutput: You bought a brand new car in the previous year and sold it for twice the price of the car you bought a year before.\nThe $6,000 purchase price of the car from 2004 you bought last year is worth $9,700 in 2005.\nThe $8,000 value of the car you sold in 2004 you bought before 2005 that you sold for $10,700.\nNow we have 3.25 x 24", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

You can use this procedure:\n60 + 20 = 60 x 20\n60 x 20 = 60 x 24\n60 x 24 = 60 x 36\n60 x 36 = 60 x 48\n60 x 48 = 60 x 72\n60 x 72 = 60 x 94\n60 x 94 = 60 x 128\n60 x 128 = 60 x 160\n60 x 160 = 60 x 208\n60 x 208 = 60 x 320\n60 x 320 = 60 x 400\n60 x 400 = 60 x 480\n60 x 480 = 60 x 960\n60 x 960 = 60 x 1120\n60 x 1120 = 60 + 1600\nSo 60 x 1120 = 600\nThe total number is 600\nIf any of these are not valid:\n60 x 28 = 60 x 72 x 16\n60 x 48 = 6 * 600 x 72 x 16 = 36\n60 x 96 = 0 * 600 x 72 x 96 = 0\n60 x 192 = 0 * 600 x 240 = 0\nIf any of these two are valid:\n60 x 48 = 0 * 600 x 32 x 32 = 0\n60 x 16 = 1 * 300 x 32 x 16 = 0\n60 x 48 = 1 * 400 x 32 x 16 = 1\n60 x 48 = 3 * 600 x 16 x 16 = 3\nWe multiply 60 by 2 + 2 = 2 + 4 + 4 = -2 + 8 to get a total of 8\nWe multiply 60 by 10 + 5 to get a total of 20\nWe multiply 60 by 40 to get a total of 80\nWe multiply 60 by 20 + 100 to get a total of 1660\nWe multiply 60 by 100 * 100 to get a total 1260\n\nInput: On December 27, 2005, a new year officially began.

{"text": "Talking to a person is like talking to them with a person, and a person is like me. The aim of communication is to affect them emotionally. A person has feelings, which can be expressed in the form of anger, happiness, sorrow, pleasure, fear, etc. Emotional effects are the only reason for communication. If you talk to a person with anger in your heart, you are communicating with someone with anger, and it isn't possible to be emotional in such a conversation. The only reason for communication is that emotion changes how the person understands what you are saying. One may never change another persons mind, but one can change the emotion surrounding him. For instance, if you hurt your partner's feelings with a blunt gesture, you are changing his mind about you. The same goes for the other way around. If, for example, you tell her how happy you are with what she says to you on the phone, you are actually changing her mind about you. In that situation, you're hurting her feelings. So, all attempts to communicate, whether emotional or intellectual, are an attempt to influence people.\n\nInput: An elderly woman was in need of money.

On her way home, she says \"Hello!\" to her parents. How many minutes will it take Alice to run to the bus stop and back home? Output:\nOn her way to work: 3 minutes 1 second\nOn her way to school: 10 minutes 0 seconds\nOn her way home: 18 minutes 47 seconds\nSince Alice is running late to work, she would need to arrive about 2 minutes before the bus is scheduled to leave work to arrive on time for her usual morning classes.\nBecause Alice leaves work about 11 minutes earlier than the bus, it would take her about 18 minutes 47 seconds to get from the bus stop to her actual work location.\nSince Alice leaves her home at 6:30 PM, it would take her 7 minutes 37 seconds to run from the bus stop to the building and back home.\nTherefore, Alice's average daily amount of time spent running in and out of her home is 24 minutes 27 seconds. Since her running time from work is 45 minutes and her running time from home is 36 minutes 35 seconds, Alice's average daily running-time is 36 minutes 54 seconds, more than a minute a day more than her average daily amount.\nWhat do you suppose this would mean? It means that Alice is getting an extra three minutes a day in total. If Alice ran 3 minutes 30 seconds faster every day, and ran 4 minutes 55 seconds faster on Sunday, then that would add about another two minutes of extra running-time to her total.\n\nInput: The following is the value of 1000.

How long did John have to wait for his mom to answer the phone?\nOutput: Let time = the amount of time it took John to dial his moms number.\nIt takes 10 minutes to dial 8 digits. If John dials 10 digits, his mom should answer his call in 40 seconds because John would have to dial 9 digits. But since he dialed 9 digits, his mom should not answer him for 15 seconds because he would have to dial 8 digits.\nThus, John would have spent 3.5 seconds to dial his moms number that took 40 seconds to receive the phone call.\nSince 5*3.5 seconds is 30 seconds, he would spend 5.5 seconds to call his mothers number.\nSo the final solution is 40 seconds + 3.5 seconds = 60 seconds.

Let x be the number of calories you consumed.\nLet x + y = the total number of calories expended during the walk.\nSo the final calorie number is\ny+x + 1 =\ny + x + 3 =\nx + y + 4 = 5\ny+x + 6 = 6\nSo the total number expended during the walk is y - x -1\ny - x - 15 = 15 calories\nAt 15 calories, you burn one gram of fat (1 calorie + 0.5 gram of fat equals 1 calorie). The total food intake that you consumed on the walk is (15 - 1) x 0.5 = ____ calories. This total is the amount of calories that you could have chosen to eat for the whole time. So, the final number is the number of calories that you should have done without food. The total number of calories that your friend would have had would be\nTotal calories - 15 = 875 calories\n(875 + 15) = ____ calories per day in energy\nAt 20 calories per day, you burn 1 gram of fat.The total intake that you consumed on their walk is (20 - 1) x 0,5 grams of fat equals 15 calories and their total food intake is (15 - 1). So, a total of 15 calories in energy. The total number of Calories you burned are (675 - 1600) x 0.5 grams of fat equals 1 calorie. The total amount of calories that they would have had is ____ calories per day. For every 800 Calories burned, their total food intake is 200 Calories. So overall, they burn 800 Calories = ____+200=1,050 calories and they consume 600 Calories = ____+700=1,150 calories every day.

E: or the same?\nOutput:The husband's apartment would likely cost more. They might even live in one apartment all together.\nThe wife might be more expensive because she is a stay-at-home mother for both children. She is home only when the kids are asleep. The kids would probably never need her all day. However, the cost of childcare would probably only be a few dollars more, at most.\nThe price difference between the two apartments might not be that noticeable. It might not be over $30 -$35, maybe not even $20.\nSo their new apartment in the same building would probably cost them $100 - $110 more, which would result in a difference of $30 - $40. But it would be worth it to them.\nSo the new apartment is probably worth it to them. No problem.\nThe wife's apartment might not be worth it to her.

Yellow Tang is the least endangered.\nSo the number of fish that are touched is 2/12 = >> 2\nOutput:\nAll of the fish that touched Yellow Tang die.\nThe total number of fish that touched the other fish is: 6\nSo the total number killed is 6 + 3 = 9\n\nInput:\nOn the left edge of a chess board, there are 100 open and open-faced squares. Each square is numbered.\nNow, we place on top of those 100 squares a square with the letters \"S\". Each square has a color that makes squares around it look like different letters. In this case, the letters begin with the letter \"S\". We arrange squares so that they form a triangle. At the top of the triangle are 9 squares that each have the letters \"F\" and \"G\". We arrange those 9 squares to make a box. Now, we turn that box upside-down so that it looks the same as before. The pieces are still all arranged in a way that makes this box look like it is containing a group of 9 squares, but this time it is filled with the letters \"I\". The letters on that square are, henceforth, referred to by a number. We know that 9 is the number of squares that we cannot touch because there is a square filled with that number. The pieces on that square are: 5: Diamond Square 6: Rectangle Square 7: Square 8: Square 9: Square 10: Square 11: Square 12: Square 13: Square 14: Square 15: Square 16: Square 17: Square 18: Square 19: Square 20: Square 21: Square 22: Square 23: Square 24: Square 25: Square 26: Square 27: Square 28: Square 29: Square 30: Square", "answer": "A: health center"}

{"text": "Where would a ticket help you get to a different country or city?\nA: train station B: MLB stadium C: lottery D/E: movie E/B: bus\n\nInput: How many people does it take to fill this stadium?\nOutput: We can answer this question by doing an exercise and writing the number of people needed.\n\nInput: Two people, Max and Tom, each have one dollar in a pile. Max puts 2 coins in a jar and throws the rest in a bowl he left outside the store, and he takes the $2. Tom puts 1 coin in a jar and throws it in the garbage can before throwing it in his waste basket. Each of them is paid 25 cents. What fraction of each dollar goes to Tom? What fraction of each dollar would go to Max?\nOutput: Tom + 25 x 2 x 1/2 = 5*100 * ((50*100) - 25) = 10*100 * ((10*100) + 125) + (25*125) + 1 = 30.33% of $2\nCombining like terms again, we get: 10*100 * ((50 - 100) - 25) = 30.33%\nSubtracting 25% from both sides, we only have 35.33%\nSo the final answer was 35%\n\nInput: A man and a woman are buying a ticket at a concert and want the best seats.

Let's do an exercise to show that.\n\nInput: A friend and a girl are talking on the phone. One girl asks, \"When's the concert?\" The other girl replies, \"Thursday. What do you think?\"\nOutput: We know that Max has $2 and Tom has $1. Now let's find the fraction of each coin that each of the girls will receive.\nMax - 2*25+11 = 15\nTom - 3 x 5*50 = 8*100-50\nTotal = 17*100 * ((5+5 + 5) + 5)*5 + 5*50 / 17 = 67\nSince Max and Tom are each getting 10% from each coin, we only have 67/17 = 67\nSo the final answer of 2\n\nInput: In a movie, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence play police officers.

He has 5 acres of farmland surrounding his flat. He does not need to buy cows, goats or sheep. His main food is meat and vegetables. How much meat can he keep?\nOutput:The amount of meat that he could keep is dependent on the number of chickens and ducks he has. The amount is dependent on the size of his chicken and duck pen. It is quite significant that he has 6 coops. He could keep between 2,500 and 2,800 chickens or up to 800 ducks. So he can increase the amount of meat this way. It is also quite important that he has a good space for his ducks. So he has an area that could be used for housing ducks and chickens. In addition he will have to have some way of cleaning his pens. So he will need a deep dish fryer, a large freezer and a refrigerator. So he could keep the amount of meat that he would need with 4 large fryers, a large freezer and 2 refrigerators (each about 10 to 14 ft long by 40 to 60 ft in width). So the total amount of meat that he can store would depend on the cooking requirements of his chicken pen. In fact he can store 200 heads of free range chicken in the coops. Of course he cannot use all of the space in the coops and also he has no way of handling the birds and so the number should be limited. So the total meat that he would keep would be: 1,500 \u2013 200 = 800.\nOutput:How many chickens and ducks can we store? Answer: 8 chickens and 200 ducks\nThis is only an approximate estimation with a great many things that we have not considered.

He starts eating 30 bananas each day for 1.5 weeks, stops eating when the bananas last for 2 days, and starts eating 30 each day for 3 days. Two more days and he is done eating bananas. He is concerned if he is losing fat. What would you advise him?\nOutput: We add together the total number of banana used and the total number of bananas eaten each day to get the total bananas/day=300.\nSince bananas have 300 calories per slice, eating 60 slices every day for 4 weeks give us 300/3 = 10.6 Calories per banana\nSince banana has 20 calories per slice, since 10.6*20 = 1600 calories\nSince bananas last 40 minutes, we multiply 60 bananas/day=1200 calories divided by 40 minutes=60 calories/hour = 1200 calories/minutes.\nTherefore this is the final food calorie/day=10.6 Calories per banana.\n\nInput:There are 5 women attending a movie.

{"text": "Civil action - Introduction: If a man walks into a bank and says: How much is the cashier working? The bank teller will be very confused - the man has no clue as to what means what. (No, it's not a joke) The bank teller may not even know that he is talking to an insurance salesman who just came in for his own account. The confusion may even go on while the person is being dealt by the bank teller. The bank teller is dealing. Confusion.\nA civil action is not to be confused with a lawsuit - a lawsuit is an action brought in the court of law in a civil court, whereas a civil action is action brought by a person or company to recover money or property from another (either within the company or against a company, or both). A civil action is also not the same as a jury trial; a jury trial involves the process of questioning witnesses to establish the facts. But the purpose of a jury trial is not necessarily the discovery process, although the jury is usually involved in this. Civil action - Explanation: A civil action is initiated by a person. The plaintiff can sue for wrong and a plaintiff is a person who suffers pain and suffering due to the wrongful act or wrongful action. The plaintiff can sue by law or by common law. In simple terms, the plaintiff is seeking to recover a monetary award. That is, a plaintiff's claim is money damages. If the plaintiff wins the lawsuit, the money will be sent to the plaintiff (usually in several installments) or the plaintiff can seek recovery of property - either money damages or property damages. In simple terms, a civil action involves two parties - one party is suing the other for damages and for the victim of the alleged wrong, and the other party is seeking money damages.\nCivil actions are usually instituted by one party who is in possession of the object of the action; this party must have access to the object to be successful in his or her action. Thus, a civil action cannot be initiated by the defendant or the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant.\nCivil action - Definition: A civil action is a lawsuit brought by a person who feels wronged or who has suffered any type of loss (e.g., because of an act of violence or injury) against another person.\nCivil actions are mostly initiated by a person whose complaint is based on a specific person or entity acting against them. That is, if the person aggrieved is a government official, the government has a legal and", "answer": "E: protests"}

If 5,000 potatoes were sold now, each sold at $10, this would raise a total of $8 million. If 5,000 potato plants were planted now, each plant would produce 25 pounds of potatoes, which would feed 1.8 million people for a year.\nAfter four years of production, the potato would be worth $300,000, which would pay for the entire planting and production costs and the potato plants could be put back on the market.\nAfter nine years, the potato would be so valuable that it would have cost $700,000 to plant and produce, and pay back the debt of $1 million.\nAfter 25 years, the potato would have paid back its entire production cost, and would still be in demand for food. So the total production cost of 1,800 potatoes would still be $1,800,000\n\nInput:Two boxes were delivered to Bill yesterday. The boxes were labeled A and B. Each box weighed 1.5 pounds. Bill counted both boxes while the driver, Tony, was loading the van. Bill wrote down the total number of boxes in each box: 13,14. He put 20/40 = 3,400 out of the boxes in the car. What did Bill do with the rest of the boxes?\nOutput: Bill put the boxes in a bin to count: 13 / 40 = 100/400 = 5/200 = 40.\nSo the final total was: $160/440 = $50/440 = $100/520 = $20/520 = $10.\nOutput is: Bill had 10 boxes, the total weight of which would have weighed 100 pounds, and so he had 100/400 = 15 boxes, which was the total number left after counting the first box.\nSo the final product is: Bill had 10 / 40 = 15/40 = 15 = 540.\nOutput is: The product has a total value of: $150.\nOutput is: There are three products in the box: 15 * $50 = 100.\nOutput is:", "answer": "E: ireland"}

{"text": "We look in the bottle. It has 6 liters in the bottom of it. If all 600 empty the bottle, it will take a total of 2000 bottles. Which 3 will be left?\nOutput: Let A = the total number of beer and B = the total number of cans, let c be the total amount of liquid left. Let x = the total amount of empty beer cans. Let y = the total amount of beer cans. If 200 x y = 600 x 200 = 3000, we get 3000 x 5 = 2200. If 5 x 5000 = 25,000, we get 25.000 x 5 = 75,000. Hence there are only 75,000 bottles. Hence, 100 x 75,000 = 150,000. Let us fill the bottle with water to 150 ml per liter, then 60 ml for each half. Then 5 ml per liter for each beer. So the final answer is 1500 ml.

Let c = the amount that you will have when you already ate dinner. Let x = the amount that you normally have for dinner. And let y = the amount of food that you usually eat on a normal day. So let us assume that a 2 and a 2 are not needed for one meal. Then we have enough food for at least two meals. We will eat an average of 2.8 servings a day, but this is too much on a normal day. But sometimes it is sufficient. So let us say that if we have only 2 times that we normally eat, we will eat 2 meals. This is the amount that will be enough for 2 meals.\nOutput: 4 servings in a day for dinner.\nInput: A table is at least 12 feet long and 6 feet high.

Alice was able to raise the blind from her Aces to 10s, with a maximum raise of her 6s and 7s. However, Barbara raised her blind each time, and did not call until the Aces were down to 2s. After each hand, we count the number of hands in which the opponent called, and sum the numbers to come up with the total number of the pots. The total number of pots in which Barbara raised was:\n\nOutput: There are 18 pots in which Barbara raises her blind on the first hand, and no pots in which Alice raised her Blind.

To decide who played which hand, we will use some randomization magic for the tables, but we will also determine by hand, which seat will be the one the A\u2019s will play. So Alice\u2019s seat will be called Seat A, and Barbara\u2019s will be called Seat B. When Alice\u2019s turn comes, she puts down her 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 pips from her Ace-7s-Ace combo. Bob then puts down his Ace-7s-King and 8 (plus his 6 pocket kings in his Jack-Ace/Jack-Queen/Ace-King-Shaft position). Barbara puts down her Ace-King, and Alice puts down her Queen. So Alice has played 3 hands, and Barbara has played 6 hands.\n\nOutput:Alice has played 9 hands, and Barbara has done exactly one hand, so we calculate their totals by the following: 100 + 2 / 9 = 33\n60 + 29 = 37\n33 / 6 = 7\n\nInput:The total number of chips in the pot is: 100 + 3,200 + 5,600 + 4,700 + 7,400 + 5,100.

The pieces are arranged one on top of the other: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). The white pieces are numbered from 1 through 6, and number one is the first piece on the game board.\nNote: We look first for a combination of (1, 2, \u2026, 6), followed by (1, 2), followed by (5) and finally by (7).

{"text": "We have to look first at the average number of villagers per household in the village. The average village house has 4.8 residents. So how many people are in the village?\nOutput: We need the average annual income of the village; the average income for the year is $10,000. So let's multiply the number of residents by 8 per household. This gives us: 1.65 * $10,000 = $32,000.\nThis means that there are 660 more residents in the village than in the average city, so we divide the annual income by 3 and get this number: 560 * $32,000 = 560 $50,000.\nUsing the same approach we used in question 3, assuming the average income from the village is $100,000, and the average number of residents is 660, the new number is: 560 $50,000 x 10 = 560 $150,000.\nSo the final number is: 560 $150,000\nThis number looks a little higher if you take the average income from the city and add in the income from the village. It would be less if you assumed the average income from the suburbs was $100,000 and the average number of people in the city was 765. So total number is not bad.\n\nInput: What is the most common car model in Italy?\nOutput: It's not a lot of trucks, it's mainly for a sport car people would sell to their friends as part of their social life.\nInput: What type of clothing was worn by soldiers stationed in Italy?\nOutputs: Trench coats, overalls, and winter-wear\nOutput: How often did soldiers smoke?\nOutput: During the World War I there were almost 300,000 soldiers in Italy.

They are separated by a distance of A. What is the speed of the train at which the two people will be separated or the speed which you can expect to be at in the end if the train speeds faster to reach you?\nOutput: Assuming that the train speeds up to equal you, so A = 200 + distance = 2000, then A = 200 * distance = >200 * 10 * Distance * speed = 50 * 1000 = 50*10000 = 100000\nSo the final answer for D, E, F is:\nD = 5 + 10 * 10 * Distance * Speed = 8 = 3600\nE = 0 + 10 * 10 * distance = 3500\nF = 0 + 10 * Distance * Speed * Distance = 3500\nSo the final answer from the above two equations is 100000*50 = >10000 * 3500 = >346090\n\nInput: 2 cars drive into a train with people standing behind them. Each person gets off 1 car, and takes a different route for their last two cars to keep getting to their destination. How many people do you expect to walk into this train at any point?\nOutput: Given the number of people standing behind the cars, only 60 people should walk into the train at any time.\nGiven the number of people standing near the cars, 5 people should walk into the trains at any time.\nAssuming both people walk into the cars simultaneously, the number of people walking into the trains will not be too large. So the total number of people passing through the train at any time will not be more than 20 people. Since all the people should get out of the train at the same time, the total number of people walking into and out of the train is 4 + 20 = 80.\nOutput: Therefore, the total number of cars moving in the train is 4 + 80 * 160 = >200 * 160 = 2000\nSo the final answer of this equation is 2400*100 = 24000*1600 = 362020\n\nInput: The square is 4x3x2x6.

What is the total amount of money that she will bring into the church today?\nOutput: We first look for the total amount of money taken from the church today: 20 * 15 + 2. Thus, there will be $30.60 + 2 + 16 = $48.60.\nWe then calculate the total amount taken from the church that day: $48.60 - $15 + 2 = $44.80.\nSince 16 children are going to church today, that means $44.80 divided by 5 = $4.36\nSo the new money taken into the church is $4.36 divided by 15 = $4.03\nSo the amount of money that will go into the church today is $4.03/$44.80\n\nInput: Alice's friend Cindy just started a job at Walmart.

The teacher has 300 books on her shelves. The teacher is buying 10 books each day. The average student takes 60 books home with them. So the total number of books she has to buy is 10*60 = 3000. The math is that in a year, the teacher will have 793 books to sell. How many books does she have to sell?

There were five babies who were born on the same day. Which was older?\nOutput: Both. They were both born in the year 5.\nBabies from two different births have the same death rate: 5/36 = 6 percent\nBabies from two births have different birth rates: 5/36 = 1.8 percent\nBabies from one born in a year have exactly the same death rate: 1/36 = 0.2 percent\nThe deaths for babies from one birth in a year will both be: -0.2 * 6.2 * 1/36 = 0 percent\nThe deaths in babies from one birth in the same year will also be: 0.2 * 6.1 * 1/36 = 1 percent\nThus, the total of deaths is: -0.2 / 1 = 6", "answer": "B: neat"}

Choices: - horse races A: track B: derby C: triple crown D: horseshoe\nOutput: Because track racing will appeal to more people, and every horse racing event has more people than the others, track horseshoes are the largest betr of the six horse races we tested.\nSo the final average bet is: 600 / 56 = <<600/56=56>>56/56 = 56 dollars per day for track horseshoes.\nThe average bet in horse racing is around 56 dollars a day, but it is less in the derby and race meeting.

Why does Marie get more money per month than Mikael?\nOutput: We assume she works 10 hours per week and earns 10,000 francs a month. Her total monthly income is 6,000 francs which is 2% of the total income in Switzerland. Marie also pays income tax in Switzerland and gets an extra 15% tax rebate for being a foreign tax payer\nSo Marie starts by earning 10,000 francs to cover all of her expenses and taxes.

After Sally sends 3,500 dollars to Mrs. P\u2019\u2019s account, a message appears at her account from Mrs. P\u2019 stating that the check could not be cashed because Mrs. P could not receive all the money. If Sally tries again, the message will not appear, so Mary should write another check. Write another check of 3,500 and Sally will send the money to her bank, Mrs. B\u2019s. Write another check of 4,000 to Mrs. B\u2019\u2019s bank, and Sally will receive the money, so Mary should write a fourth check of 6,000. So Mary should have 1 check, 6 checks, and 6,000 total.

So if you need deodorant at the pharmacy, you will be spending 60/600g = 7.5 cents each time, so you would need to buy it a minimum of 3 times. You can also buy it at the grocery store: 100g deodorant is sold at 600g/100g = 11 per 100g (which is 1/6 the pharmacy price: 10/$), and 100g deodorants are also sold at 600g/1000g = 12 per 100g (which costs only 10\u00a2 more than a bottle of 1000g): 100g deodorant 1/6 the pharmacy cost: 10/$. This means that you can buy 2 bottles at the same time if you buy from the pharmacy a minimum of 3 times, assuming you buy 30g per bottle. So if you buy it from the pharmacy a minimum 3 times, then you\u2019d need to: 1: buy 30g in each bottle 2: buy 2 bottles together.

Let's start by saying the first choice is A. A is the first movie theater in town. So, let's look at A first in this problem. Let's say the person who went to the movie theater was not looking at A, but was actually at A, which means they looked at B and C. Let's look at A first. Let's say the last person who went to A, which is the one who was actually looking at A, looked at C and then went to B and B. The first time A was ever not used is at 0012. Before that, there were 10 people who looked at A and then went to B. There were 4 people looking at A and then went on a train to town E (there was 1 train) and 2 people looking at A and going to the bathroom (there was 0 train).

So, on average, 15 people don't look at the bathroom either. So, on average 1 bathroom goes unoccupied for each day of the week. There's a washroom for everyone.

The actual price, the current price and the discounted price are all the same. So how much do I get by taking half-price instead of new? Since it is the same price, 50 x 50 x 0,50 x (5 x 0.5), 50 x (5 x 10) and 50 x (10 x 0.5) x 0.50 x ($0.50 x 5) = $50.25 / year.

(60/36 = 60/12). Thus $1200 = $1200 x 600 = $1800 and $1800 is more than $1800.\nOutput: We write 60/36 = 60/60 = 600/600 = $800 and thus $800 = $800 x 600 = $1200.\n\nInput: 1 hour = 30 cents $60 = $60\nOutput: We want the answer to the following question:\"How many hours will it take for $600 to pay $60?\"\nInput: 1 hour - $600 = 120\nOutput: The answer is 1 hour - 60 cents = 60 cents.\n\nInput: This is the second question: If you have money that is 20", "answer": "C: health"}

{"text": "All of the above\nThe key to holding events in an organised fashion is in the location. If you have so many people going to an event that you are spending all your time worrying about where it will be held, you should look for an appropriate venue. It is worth noting that the reception is normally the event's main function, with small groups of guests coming in and out of the event as they chose. The reception is unlikely to last throughout the entire event, so it makes it important not to put too much energy into making it a special event. A good location is probably best for the reception to be held in, as it gives you the chance to do something different. However, it is important to note that the function does not end with the reception; rather, the event continues even afterwards with a dinner or drinks at the end of the event.\n\n input: \"A.A\" and \"B.B\" have 60 candy each.

Using a tape measure.\nOutput: In order to estimate a person's size, we look at people's heights from the waist up.\nIn order to estimate a person\u2019s height, we need to know how tall that person is and how many inches are in a foot. First we\u2019ll look at his/her neck and head. If the neck and head are equal, he/she is 6 feet. If the neck and the head are 2 inches or less apart, he/she is 7 feet. If the neck is 2 inches or more apart, he/she\u2019s 8 feet.\nNext we\u2019ll use our height measurement to determine the average height in inches. Then we\u2019ll take the average height in inches to determine his/her height in feet. The feet is just an indication. If the person is very tall, he/she may have feet that are 5 feet, 6 inches tall. If the person is moderately tall, he/she might have feet that are 4 feet, 8 inches tall. If the man is a good example, he may have feet that are 4 \u00bd feet tall. If he were in the average weight range, he\u2019d have feet that are 5 \u00bd feet tall. Thus, we can calculate a person's height in feet.\nIn order to measure a person\u2019s body, we take one of his/her feet and measure his body with that foot. If he has long legs, he\u2019s usually tall. If he has short legs, he\u2019m maybe shorter.\nIf a person has a lot of muscle mass, he/she may be taller. If he/she has little muscle mass, he/he may be shorter.\nIf a girl is standing behind her husband, he/she he tall.

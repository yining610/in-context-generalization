This is tall for a girl, but short for a boy.  Sometimes people wonder why I am so short.  No one quite knows why girls and boys are so different.  They are the same height, but we all do the same things differently. For reasons I know not yet, they were created differently.  I have no idea why this happened, and I doubt it is ever going to be explained.  It could be for one of two reasons.  1) The scientists were all women, so their decision to make girls different meant they had less sex, so sex was low on the list of priorities. 2) The scientists were all men, so their decision to create boys meant they could have kids, and more sex was high on the list of priorities, so sex was high on the priority list. I am not sure, maybe that is it.  I could find out.  Maybe someday.\n\nThis is just a short list of interesting facts about me, but there are much more.

In this activity you will find information on the Aims Of School and our key learning objectives for the year ahead.\nIn addition to reviewing these, our students will also be asked to set up their own key learning objectives for the school year ahead. This includes making a short list of learning outcomes that relate to your key learning objectives for the Aims Of School, and then listing key learning results that will help your child achieve his or her learning outcomes.\n\nYour child is to come up with their own main objectives for the year ahead, as well as a list of key outcomes and key learning results. The student can then write the answers to a multiple-choice question on their personal journal. These questions should be relevant to the Aims Of School.\nIf your child doesn't have a personal journal (which can be purchased), you can buy one to use at home. Please note: personal journals can only contain one question per page.\nRemember: You can purchase any number of personal journals from us.\n\nThe answers given to the multiple choice questions should also be used as a way to check your child's progress in reaching their personal objectives. If there are gaps within your child's learning, and the key learning results don't reflect this, you can use the multiple selection choices to set a new challenge for your child.\nWe'd like to hear from you! If you have any questions, or need help, please give us a call. Your feedback is invaluable to us and will help us continue to improve our products.\n\nThe final activity will assess your child's progress in achieving their learning outcomes set in their personal objectives. This assessment takes the form of writing a paragraph detailing the main aspects of the child's learning. These could be: how your child's learning is going, what they've already learnt in each lesson, and how they've done in the tasks set out for them in the lesson. Again, this can be used as a way of checking where your child is at with meeting their learning outcomes. As with the multiple choice questions, your child can find more information on these on our website and find answers to your child's question in our website's FAQ section.\nPlease note: This assessment will take the form of a written answer (not a multiple choice). It will allow teachers to give more of an honest assessment of your child's progress.\nThe final question will", "answer": "D: missing out"}

Answers: 12, 4, 12, 5,12,2,16, and 9\nOutput:14\n\nInput:What would YOU do if you read the following passages as text?\nEx:\n\nYou are a computer. In the beginning, your programming was simple enough. But as time progressed and you began to need to make adjustments, you became much more complex. And you would find yourself needing to program much more complicated calculations, while also working in the physical world and the scientific world.\n\nNow you have a problem. You will have to multiply the results of a particular formula, along with several independent variables, in order to find the correct result. But to accomplish the calculation, you first must take the time to find the corresponding variable and to determine its value. You will need to look at hundreds or more independent variables at the same time. All of which you can do on a personal computer. Not only do you have to do all of this individually, but you also will have to process the data. And sometimes that is done while you are working within the physical space that you yourself created. You will need to compute the data while you are working. You will need to deal with error control. And sometimes you will have to modify the mathematical function itself. And you will need to update the data by entering yet another calculation and storing the results.\n\nYou need to be able to handle these problems in a logical sequence. Each of which you can do individually. Not as required by your programming instructor. This is especially the case, when you are dealing with the problems of the physical world. The system was developed long ago, and is fully automated. But the problem you are facing is still within your own computer programming.\n\nBut now you have an added problem. The system needs to calculate your result, while you are working within your physical world. The system is trying to solve the problem of time in order to calculate the calculations that are related to time, but in the physical world. These calculations need to operate within the time that is limited by the physical conditions of the physical world.\n\nSo now you finally reach a solution. You figure out how to do it on the spot. You start by figuring out how to compute the data. Then you start by determining the correct calculations and storing them in the required form.\n\nThen, you start by inputting the calculations and storing them in a particular form.", "answer": "C: aircraft carrier"}

The answer to the second question is also yes -- again, the meaning is unclear -- either \"a teacher\" implies that the speaker is a teacher and therefore says that \"John the baker\" will answer the question about the bees' throat, and John is a baker, or \"the baker was walking down a road,\" implies that John the baker works in a bakery so Mary didn't need to give the correct answer.\n\nNow that we've worked out how to solve the two questions, let's see how we can answer the second question.\n\n(A reader might ask what the reader thinks of the word \"bakery\" if it doesn't necessarily imply a particular type of baker.

{"text": "24\n\nHow to make paper boats from toilet paper tubes and string\n\nHello everyone,\nLast year I made a paper boat model my brother did with me and it lasted a couple of days. This year I wanted to make the model last a full day so I used a more modern approach. My brother has been playing with an 8mm polyester felt pen which is perfect for a model boat as the cardboard tubes that come with the pen bend and break easily after the first hit. To make a wooden boat, I started with cutting out 8 felt pen tubes from a sheet of polyester fibreboard. I glued a piece of paper towel to the bottom and cut out a circular hole by putting the felt tube in it. Then I used a 2\u00d74 piece of wood as legs for the boat. I cut a slot into the bottom of the wood with a serrated razor blade to fit the felt tubes. I glued together the wooden legs and tied them together with bungee cords. Now I just cut a hole in the centre of the felt for the fuel tube from the small tube I glued to the bottom of the boat.\nMy son went out this afternoon and put a 2\u00d74 piece as a support for the boat. As usual, he had no idea how everything works with my boat! Thank you for your help,\nHolly", "answer": "B: own cars"}

{"text": "He was hoping to achieve A. He wants to look attractive on his date.\n\n(Hint: The answer is one of the questions you have to answer)\n\nI have been trying to get my boyfriend to clean the house. I get angry when he does not and tell him to get the kids ready and out the door. I am very controlling when it comes to housework. I also made the mistake of saying \"No\" to him being out late on the weekend. He was very frustrated and was going out drinking with a couple of friends. I asked him to clean the house while he was gone, but he refused! He was upset that I told him \"No\" instead of letting him deal with the things that needed attention. Now I am wondering if I need to find another way that he will get over being frustrated with me?\n\nComments for Question: 1) What do you believe are the pros and cons of being \"very controlling\" of a boyfriend when it come to housework?\n\nA: There is not much of a con, although maybe you're punishing him for his poor choices. I am sure he is a great guy! I do think being able to enjoy yourself on your day off without a lot of pressure is a great thing in a relationship, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to have certain days off.\n\nWhen it comes to the pros, I like to think this is the best time of your relationship to show him this type of behavior will not be tolerated. Being very controlling of your partner's life, and making him feel that you are the only strong one in the relationship, makes them feel insecure and unsure. Just say \"I love you\" and walk away.\n\nI am a woman in a long distance relationship with a man for over a year. I get mad if he does not pick up the laundry after our nightly trip or goes to the mall with his friends. What should I do?\n\nComments for Answer:\n\nInput: What is your opinion on being \"very\" controlling of a boyfriend?\n\nOutput: I have no opinion about whether or not you can be \"very\" controlling. What I do like about having someone around you just to have someone around to help you with any day-to-day things that you may have to do can help make you feel safer in the relationship.\n\nI used to live with my boyfriend.

Any help would be appreciated!\n\nThe solution is a single point. The point is where I intersect my straight line and I draw a horizontal line from the point to the horizontal. Now the two lines meet at a point.\n\nYou may think of the point as being at the horizontal as well. So you make the horizontal line to the left intersect the first line. Then you make a horizontal line parallel to these two lines to the right. You can do a triangle at the point. Then you draw a vertical line.\n\nThe point is where you intersect your straight line and you draw a horizontal line from there to a point. When two straight lines intersect the only thing you can do is take off an angle off one of them. Otherwise you just draw straight lines.\n\nI would say only draw straight lines with that axis, but you can just use the point if you want to do that. You can still draw a triangle with the point in the triangle. It's just you don't think of it as being on the axis. The point lies on the same line as the lines.\n\nIn AP Calculus, in the 3rd problem, the question is:\n1.\nSuppose there are 5 lines with a common base. Each line has 5 lines.

This journal allows me to practice techniques and also get feedback when it's not going well. I prefer to use a pencil, although I am starting out using pens, and I prefer to draw on water-color paper for better contrast. I like to work with my friend Janie to talk about our favourite things we think about when journaling and what prompts us to write. \"\n\n1.\n\n\"Last spring I went to Hawaii. I spent all day at the beach, watching the ocean and the clouds. Around me many people were enjoying the warm sun, I saw many people sun bathing but it was also raining so I also spent a good amount of time sunbathing in the waters. I noticed the temperature of the water was warmer than a body of water that was on land. It was hard for me to imagine that a hot pool water was hotter than the ocean water I had just enjoyed.\n\n\"My first time on a beach was when I was five years old. The only thing that was different was that I had a towel. I remember standing on the sand, soaking in the heat. Then I remembered my mother had a towel too since we had stayed a couple of days at a beach house. I looked at my mother and asked her where her towel was and she said the beach isn't very shallow so I went back to the house and brought my towel. I spent most of the day standing in the sand looking at the ocean. After the sun go down, we went to our table at the outdoor bar and played cards.\"\n\n2.\n\n\"When I was little I lived in a small village in China, it had many temples and the one I most remember was the Temple of Heaven. I was really eager to go there and so when I was only four, I went to my mother's home to bring my grandmother's picture back from the temple. I remember sitting on a bench reading my book, when I noticed my grandmother's picture had been moved to a position under the tree near the edge of the bench. I could feel something moving in the background, I was very excited so I asked my mother where the picture was and she said that the picture is not really that important and that we would have to find another place to sit and read our book.

{"text": "6\n\n1 Answer\n1\n\nYour problem isn't as difficult to answer as it seems. A microphone boom in a stock market event is in front of the camera (as you know for cameras) and is likely to be covering the sound of the event. Now, if a sound does happen on the camera and is masked by a microphone boom then either the camera operator did it himself (i.e. the stock traders do it) or a sound company has set up the boom for the event and it's likely that it's on-set. However, there is no reason for us to suppose that a sound company does it, so your answer will have to say something similar to the answer of #8.\n\nSo the questions asks you to take a guess at which way the boom was used as a mask for the sound. To answer the question correctly, you need to go back to the first sentence of the question and count all of the stickers on any page of Mary\u2019s journal up to the end that\u2019s still stickers. You only need to count seven stickers because the question only asks us to count how many stickers are still on any page, and there are only seven pages in total. So, for example, suppose there are only five stickers and a sixth sticker is on Mary\u2019s first page. Then Mary has 89 stickers left. Given her total number of stickers, that means there are 89 stickers on the first page. Since we only count stickers we see on pages, that means that there are 89 stickers on page one on average, and there are 89 stickers on every page after that. That means there must be eight stickers after page one that are still stickers on average, and there must be five stickers on pages two through nine that are still stickers on an average page. So you need to say that there must be eight stickers remaining after page one because there are still 9 stickers on first page.\n\nThe more challenging part is answering the question about the location and shape of the microphone boom, and since we\u2019re only given the numbers that the questions gives us we have only two possibilities:\n\neither the microphone boom is located behind a camera (which, because you know cameras are often mounted on or above a camera tripod) is in front of the stock market scene (which means we should find how the stock market scene is changing) or\n\nin front of the stock market is in the middle behind a camera (which means we should come up with how the stock market", "answer": "A: new york"}

What is the percentage of stickers Alice has left?\nOutput: 94%\n\nInput:Mary had 91 stickers. She used 6 large stickers to 3 of her journal pages. She had 4 medium stickers on the other 3 pages. What is the percentage she has left?\nOutput : 44\n\nInput:Mary's first choice is that of giving the AI a secular education.  She says that the alternative might come either through force or through education.  How do you feel this could affect the future results?  Output : 44\n\nInput :Mary had 84 stickers. She used 5 large stickers on her notes.  How many stickers does she have total?\nOutput : 88\n\n*Answer below - This question takes place a year later, on Christmas Eve.  The main reason for choosing that choice from that year is that it is much more likely that the AI will choose a secular education. However, it also offers a large number of possible outcomes that could also happen, and so it is difficult to assign an answer.\n\nInput:Mary has an additional 89 stickers.  The only stickers in Mary's journal that are used are the 2 large stickers on page 2 and the 1 large sticker on page 6.  What is the percent of her stickers that are still around to this date?\nOutput: 94\n\nIn addition, how likely is it that the AI will choose to learn Christianity versus Christianity in the first place?\nOutput : 88%\n\nInput:If the AI chooses to learn Christianity, what are the likely consequences?\nOutput : 74%\n\nThis question is much more difficult to formulate and answer.  A secular education seems to have a much higher chance of success than any sort of religious education and an alternate Christian education.  The AI would also have to think outside the box about its own beliefs, and come to conclusions that the AI would not, and so it would be interesting to see the outcome of the AI thinking through its own thoughts.  The end result of this question might very well show what the AI chooses and what the AI learns.  Even though the final choice is fairly easy to give, there probably are many different ways for this question to go wrong.\n\n### *NOTE: The number of stickers remains the same but the categories are slightly different.*\n\nInput :If Alice chooses to learn Christianity, What are the likely consequences?", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

It\u2019s about a boy who can play on his own for some time and then a group of girls in another class want to play with him. They go down to his desk and find out that he has a really big toy dinosaur next to his desk. After they play with that toy for some time they ask him to play with them, but so far he doesn\u2019t know what to do: he can\u2019t seem to pick a favorite thing and his hands are getting tired! After some of the girls leave he sees a man coming in his direction, but first he shouts his name from a distance: \u201cHEY! WHO ARE YOU?\u201d The man is the guy from class before, he is looking very surprised because this isn\u2019t what he expected to see. Then the man explains to them how the dinosaur was made, how it was a gift from friends and how it belongs to a museum in Rome, so they can still play with it. And after they leave the dinosaur comes to life, it starts to move its back legs a lot: \"It\u2019s alive!\" \"Why is it moving like that?\" The boy is shocked, \"Does it have to?\u201d he says and looks at the dinosaur even more attentively! The man tells him that all those movements mean that it needs water and the boy has to bring it back to life to get water from outside. The boy, who doesn\u2019t seem to understand what he is going to do, rushes off to ask his mom if he can bring the dinosaur back to life because he needs to go to the zoo and this toy is so important to him. It took him about 5 minutes until his mother comes to the window, picks up the dinosaur and returns it to him.\n\nI don\u2019t have any posters either.

Shouldn't the plans have at least those permit numbers in order to protect the work from being cancelled or delayed?  Ans: C; the plans must contain minimum information\n\nAnswer: C is the correct answer. The plans must contain no information that could be used to cancel or delay the project. But the construction site still needs permits. The project could be delayed because the paperwork is not complete.\nThere are 789 parking spaces on the first floor, 443 on the second, and 486 on the third.

That meant that the only times to leave was when?choices: A: morning B: morning C: late afternoon D: late afternoon E: late afternoon\nOutput: 40\n\nThis is a tough one! It's hard to assign only 5 options without looking at it too carefully. The way \"early morning\" is indicated (even though you are only leaving on those very few times) in some of these cases is a little suspect as to the time. I suppose \"afternoon\" and \"early evening\" are obvious. They just seem easier choices? However, I don't know if I could give a specific answer about which is \"right.\"\n\nHere are a couple other problems from the first section:\n\n### Input:When do you leave school late?\nOutput: 3:35\n\n### Input: When is the earliest time to leave school late?\nOutput: 2:50\n\n### Input: How long do you need to be at school to be sure that the most part of the day is covered?\nOutput: 20 minutes\n\n### Input:How long do I need to be at school so that I can finish in a timely manner?\nOutput: 35 minutes\n\n### Input : When do you start an assignment? You are supposed to answer this with the first time you started the assignment.\nOutput: 4:00\n\n### Input :When do you finish an assignment?\nOutput: 7:50\n\nThe fact that the time that you get the question correct on the first try is a sign that your skills are improving. If you were able to make these correct answers in 2 hours at first, the rate of improvement improves if you do them in less time each time. Over time, I'd expect you to get a little better at making these sorts of choices, but maybe a little at the same time? Who knows? It will probably happen if you keep at it.\n\nThe second section on choices seems a lot easier than the first. I think this is due in part to the fact that there are already several options. The next time you do these there will probably be some more choices and this should make the second section easier.\n\nAnother way to think about problems like these is that the number of points your given to a question will increase with the difficulty of the test. The reason for this is that, as you get higher in the test", "answer": "A: early morning"}

If you have enough information (the number of sticker pages and the number of stickers in the case) then it shouldn't be that hard.\n\nSorry, this is supposed to go elsewhere...\nHow does your question work? There's no way for me to know how many stickers Mary has left since I've never printed her journal.\n\nThe question is asking for an output.\nIt should be possible to provide numbers from input.\n\nThe problem with your question is that the answer is completely arbitrary, and that's the whole point of doing problems like this. What you should probably be doing is asking the questions\nHow many stickers is Mary likely to have? how many are left? and asking for the last few stickers to the most likely answer. The answer is still entirely arbitrary, though (since people will answer differently).\nThe point of the problem isn't to answer accurately, just to provide a few useful tools for answering what question to ask next.\n\nIt feels like your question is asking for arbitrary answers that are arbitrarily subjective. It's like you're forcing us to guess things based on how the questions work.\nI do agree that there's no way to figure out what the correct answer is. Maybe what I'm expecting is too obvious. I should have said 'if a person wants to guess.' I'm sure a lot will guess 'three,' but that would just be wrong on the answer.\n\nThe point of the question is not arbitrary, but rather to make the person answer the question. Of course, the answer is going to be either 'A' or 'B,' or 'C'. In any case, most of the stickers are still in Mary's journal, so the answer to the question is still 'Three'. Any further questions I could ask are pointless.\nFor what it's worth, the original question asked for the number of pages not used stickers; however, I think the original question implied that there would be an answer that could be described as \"Nine stickers.\" That answer was wrong, since there's nothing in the answer.", "answer": "C: going to court"}

He was in his 8th grade year when the ship carrying his class landed on a mysterious island. On the island, Peter is the only student, and all the other students (including the teacher) are locked in a massive library.  Peter, being the only human (other than himself) being on the island, does his best to survive in the library. Some time later, Peter runs into a group of other students and makes friends with them. Eventually he discovers a book in the library which has an \"X\" over the words \"N\" and \"Y.\" In his exploration of the island, Peter comes across a large hole where the book said \"N\" was, indicating where the words \"Y\" were. Peter figures out that the hole is probably one of the entrances to the library, through which he had been barred from the library. But since he cannot see the door, which has been blocked by a large rock, Peter decides to throw himself down the hole and explore the library by himself. After a few hours, Peter manages to get inside the library and finds the entrance to the boat. When he gets back to the surface, he finds that his book has vanished! While trying to find his book, Peter and the other students become separated, Peter goes on to find more books and eventually his friends and family also get separated. On the way home, Peter comes across a huge rock blocking the escape road, and decides to just stay in the cave as well. During his stay in the cave, Peter finds several more books. Soon he realizes that the others have also run out of books. Peter decides to get back to the surface and return to the other boys in the library. Eventually Peter comes across his missing book \"N\" again, and his search for \"N\" ends up taking him all the way back to the ship and making a miraculous find- A.

It was pretty good. It was about women all over the world. Not just Hollywood or American. They don't talk too much and when they do talk they talk a lot. Well, there were lots of women in the movie. I also had another fun class today, about the American and Canadian political parties: the Republican and Democratic parties. In this movie, they had different ways to win. They wanted the people of America to love them. In order to win, they would go over to their opponents and \"smash\" them. They were kind of mean and disgusting really. It was quite an eye opener. In the movie people actually voted in the American election. Now in Canada they vote by a different way. The people vote for who they think will win in the election. I will explain how they get the idea of the election here in a little bit. First, in Canada you have the popular vote for the party to win. In America, we don't vote for the party. We vote for the person. Well, first, the popular vote doesn't mean that much in Canada. Only 26,000,000 people voted in the last Canadian election. So, you have a choice in Canada. You can vote for a politician. They get votes from a district and that district votes. Then they are voted in as a senator or a deputy leader. Then they would work with people and get bills passed. There are some very hard working politicians in Canada. They really need the vote of people for our job. That is really cool.

{"text": "42\n\nYour answer is incorrect - there are 3 correct answer choices.\n\nCorrect answer choices are:\n\nA:  Short term\nB:  Crowd\nC:  unpredictable\nD:  frequent\nE: Eternal\n\nIn this set of questions and answers, you see a common theme - how is society defined and defined when it is used for good? When people use the secular parties to have fun or in some cases to escape from personal difficulties, is God's definition of society always true? God could never be used to justify this behavior. The world is a very violent world and society is full of bad actors - it is sometimes easier to use secular parties as a temporary escape. This is a common theme that Christians have a hard time accepting because it means the very idea of God is being rejected.\n\nSo, what do you do about this? I suggest you make a habit of turning secular parties into something for God's sake. Many secular party organizers want to help atheists or agnostics and want us to have a great time. They want us to have a good time and that is okay. We should be celebrating the secular parties for the secular parties themselves - they are just that - events that occur with people for the sake of having a good time. We don't need to make it more than that - we only need to make it better.\n\nSo, is society a place we can use God as an excuse while still enjoying secular parties? Why? Because we are in the presence of the One who is always with us in our moments of need. People who believe that life is fragile and that sin is always a bad thing have no basis in God so why should we expect him to be there to help us if we need help?\n\nSo as we celebrate secular parties as an opportunity to have fun, make sure to celebrate it for someone else as well.", "answer": "D: frequent"}

I've tried to write an example of the author's explanation on the bottom of the box.\n\nExample from the book I will use.\nThe human body consists of an exterior shell, a core, a brain, and some vital tissue. The brain is the most vital component. It has vital functions that help coordinate the movement and control of muscles and organs, and it produces all kinds of chemicals and nutrients in order to sustain these vital activities. The brain also creates and regulates an environment which guides the movements of the body, and which in turn helps regulate the movements of the whole body. The brain's structure and function can be studied using the same techniques of surgery as one of the organs (see the section on cranial surgery) and can be used to diagnose and perhaps even to repair diseases. But the brain is not simply the organ of thought, speech, and movement, which is the usual and often preferred medical image of it. The brain is an organ that carries information from the body, and hence can represent abstractions in a way the other organs do not.\n\nExample from another book I will use:\nEvery child wants to fit in.

{"text": "What is the opposite of foolish? Choices:  B: careless A: foolish C: careful D: cautious E: cautious\n\nWhen you are completing questions 1, 2, and 3 (and other questions like this) in the middle of the workbook, you must choose which of the following answers will help you the most:\n\nAnswer 1: Foolhardy is clever but foolish is foolish and wise. You can show your thinking about all these options by looking carefully and carefully trying to pick the answer that your teacher will like best (don't forget not to guess right!). Try answering multiple choice questions on the board, then do the same for questions 1 and 2 (and other answers like this) in the workbook.\n\nAnswer 2: It's foolish to put stickers on the front of a document that cannot be removed later. You must put stickers on the front page (in front of the covers) in all your journal papers. You can put any type of stickers on the front page, but you must use them on the front of the paper. You can put small stickers all around your page, but any stickers that you put on the front end are stuck to your paper. For smaller or bigger stickers there are three options available, depending on whether you choose the front or back of your paper. You will usually see that there is another option near the bottom of each sticker which says \"Back\" or \"Front,\" but there might be no choice if you are a student with both back and front stickers!\n\nAnswer 3: Wise people take a lot of risks but Foolhardy people make fools of themselves. Wise folks always have an exit plan; foolish will never be caught by surprise. The person who answers questions 1, 2 and 3 correctly is the wisest person in the class.\n\nWhen questions 4, 5 and 6 come up try these options to figure out what you want to know. Note the options near the bottom of each of the stickers which has \"Back\" or \"F.A.\" (see the above answer to question 3):\n\nAnswer 4:Foolhardy may be wise but Foolish does not. The person who answers question 4 correctly will tell you they were right and that is the answer you need. This answer is sometimes the easy right answer, but not always. A wise person who does not answer question 4 correctly will tell a wrong answer and you would have a very hard time finding that out on your own.\n\nYou may find that you chose", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}

If the dollar is easy to get out of without breaking, there is no point in having a bank.\n\nAnswer: #3\n\nQuote:\n\nThe only way I can think of for a dollar to get inside an envelope would have to be a zipper. Zippers could be manipulated by anyone as long as they had the zipper mechanism. They could also be glued on the inside. However, I could see someone with lots of practice zipping on the outside of envelopes, but I would think it would be a fairly complex technique.\n\nWhat do you think? Could it also be an easy way to get a dollar out of the envelope?\n\nIt could, assuming that the secret is to open the envelope and insert the dollar. (ie, you need to open your envelope first)\n\nQuote:\nThey could also be glued onthe inside for easy access, but how do they make that an appealing technique? I don't think people would like it.\n\nWell, they could be made to be easily removed if/when needed. I personally do not like zippers (don't ask!). They can be easily removed by cutting them (a little like the way people remove stickers from the edge of their envelope).\n\nQuote:\nI could see someone with lotsof practice zipping on theoutside ofenvelopes, but I wouldthink it would be a fairly complicated technique.\n\nDepends on how many envelopes they have. If it is many envelopes, a zipper might be a good design to use, but if it's just one, cutting is probably the best way to do it. In my mind, if your main concern is a zipper on the outside, the best option is to have a zipper on the inside and glue in place for easy removal. If the key is to open the envelope yourself, then you want to keep the envelope sealed and keep the money inside.\n\nQuote:\nThere could be an easier way like a button on the inside?\n\nThis is not possible. Zippers do not have buttons on them.\n\nQuote:Zippers could also beglued onthe inside for easyaccess.

{"text": "NEGOTIABLE\n\nAnswer:\n\nThis question is easy for many students to answer. If you have a limited source of facts then you can use these facts to support your answer. Use your own facts or facts in another class.\n\nIn the first question (which has 2 choices) all of them are correct.\n\nExample:\n\nWhen you get the information on the front side of the paper you do not use your own facts, you simply use the source at the bottom. Now you have a list of facts for this question. Next, when you use the source at the top you can find another list of facts. By doing this you can make your answer more easily. You can also make your answer more easily from multiple choices.\n\nTo help you remember, here is an example of questions with multiple choices:\n\nThe first question tells about a car, the second one is about a house and the third one is about a car. Here is the meaning of the question:\n\nThe first part of the question tells if the house and the car are real. The answer is \u201cno\u201d and \u201cyes\u201d for the first question and the answer is \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d for the next question. When you use the source at bottom, now you know the name of the house and the car, you have the answer to the next question \u201cWhich of these are real?. If you know these names then you know the house and the car. That\u2019s the purpose of source at bottom.\n\nThe second part of the question tells about the street. The answer is \u201d yes\u201d and \u201c no\u201d. It\u2019s the same as the first part of the answer and also your knowledge the first part of answer. This part of the answer tells about the street too. So, you know the street and you know the house.\n\nThe third part of the question tells you the street and about the house and the house and when you use the source you know about the street and the house. With the street you know about the house about and the house is the house of yours.\n\nSo the answer to the question is : the answer is\u201cyes\u201d\u201d yes to the house and the street(yes to real) and the answer is\u201cno\u201d\u201d no to the street(the house is real) and the house(the house).", "answer": "A: netherlands"}

Over the next 20 years the net interest costs are expected to rise from 0.1% to 0.25%. This means that the cost of the debt is expected to reach \u00a33.8trillion.  In order to reduce interest payments the government will need to take additional tax and spending measures.  Which should be the more important measures?\nOutput: \u00a33.8 trillion\n\nInput:The annual interest rate on the British National Debt currently stands at 0.25%.  The interest is paid on money that has been raised via bond offerings.  Bonds are issued by the government to raise money to finance the budget deficit. The interest cost is not factored in to the budget deficit.  This makes the cost of the British National Debt a very low cost of debt.\nWhich measure of current debt has the highest impact on the budget deficit?\nOutput: \u00a3300bn\n\nInput:You are given", "answer": "C: shopping mall"}

She also uses 8 smaller stickers to recall the day's events.\nMary adds more than 200 items to her Journal in the first day, and she accumulates 5 stickers for each of the first six months.  For example, she writes: \u201cThis notebook is full of surprises!  I just finished my 8th day!!\u201d every fourth entry.

{"text": "C\n\nIn the case of civil action: It can be a form of regulation or statute. The other terms are confused. In the case of riot: There might be rioters, but there is no legislation. When there is a confusion about a word, there should be a rule or a law. There are many problems with that rule and law, see, for example, a student's refusal to write a required response to a test. When there is a riot: there will be a police force, and if those forces are ineffective then there will be violence on the streets. When there is a police force and they are ineffective, there will be riots.\n\nIn the case where there is confusion: That confusion is a problem within the field of government. (See also the word confusion: A student who uses incorrect language in a text book.)\n\nWhich word is correct: Confusion? Or confusion.? There may be confusion in the field of government. If there is confusion within the government it means that there is confusion with respect to the government as a whole, or that there are several different levels of government.\n\nIn the context of the word confusion, the definition is \"something that causes confusion.\" There is a lack of clarity about government itself, at least between the two basic levels of government, the Executive and the Legislative. Because of the lack of clarity there may be multiple levels of government as there have been many over the years. As there has been multiple levels of government there have been multiple definitions of government with its own rules and regulations. There has also been confusion over which of the various levels of government is the proper level for government.\n\nIn a case where there is confusion within government there is the danger of a form of confusion between laws or regulations being applied to all levels of government and not just to one level, and there is the fear of confusion between law and regulations being applied to those regulations that do not apply to those regulations being applied to others that do apply, and thus causing a confusion about which laws apply, or which rules apply. That is another name for confusion. See also confusion: A student who gives incorrect answers to tests.\n\nThe confusion is also the danger of politicians interpreting laws in ways that make people more comfortable with government.

Jasiel heard noises coming from the front room at the computer.  Jasiel was wondering what was going on. She heard clicking and hitting sounds coming from the computer.  After thinking about it some more she got the keyboard out of the box.  The typing was getting very messy and she noticed there was a few stickers missing from both pages.  She took the computer out of reach of the screen so no one could see.  She was trying to remember what all she had done for the year thus far.  She made up her own version of what the student had done. After putting everything back in its proper place she tried pressing the keys again and then waited.  With no luck Jasiel turned his attention back to the student.  The key presses didn\u2019t seem to be registering but Jasiel tried pressing the keys again.  After several tries Jasiel finally got the computer to register some commands.  He typed in some basic commands to the computer. When that didn\u2019t work he hit CTRL-F then CTRL-V.  He thought it odd that if he typed \u201cR\u201d while it was playing the sound wouldn\u2019t it show the \u201cReplay\u201d button? Jasiel felt that it would be easier to look at the computer on the monitor than the screen itself.\nFor some unknown reason the keyboard kept rebooting.  It took quite a while to type out more commands.  Then finally the computer restarted without any errors. Jasiel waited as long as she could to see what was going to happen.\nShe wasn't sure if it would be the same as the first attempt but the student did her best.  It took a considerable amount of time, but eventually Jasiel got the computer to turn on.  Once it was ready she noticed that the computer mouse was missing from all the pages.  And there was a small hole in the screen under the keyboard.  She was very confused with what she had done. Jasiel typed in some commands on the keyboard. When they showed their sign of life the next thing she saw was the mouse showing where it was placed.  Once she got rid of the mouse she took a glance at the computer. She was a little concerned that it showed a blue screen, but she made sure", "answer": "D: human being"}

In fact, if you were trying not to worry about these stickers in particular, you would probably just not cover them with the last page of the journal. In regards to Mary\u2019s photos, I\u2019m sure that it was probably easy for Mary to wipe these stickers off of her wristband in between photos when she wasn\u2019t wearing them. After all, it wasn\u2019t too difficult to just keep them in a container and toss them in when her photo time was finished. I think I would want to make it easier though by taking an extra 3 photos with the wristband being open for everyone to see.

Output: 44\n\nInput - An  illegitimate designer is a designer who uses an item of clothing that was not made by a legitimate designer.  Outlet - The second-hand clothing shop sells products made by other people.  If  the shop does not offer a guarantee as is customary, how can  the retailer be sure you are not getting a counterfeit or a poorly made garment?  Example  The store will:   1) check the number of stitches on all the stitching on the clothing 2) check the construction with respect to the material 3) ask for a certificate from the fabric maker for its authenticity.\n Outlet - A designer sells clothing at  a department store retail outlet.  The outlet sells clothing that was not made using his or her own fabrics.  The store does not offer a guarantee, either as to quality or as to the legality of the clothing.\n\nYou may not edit the source code without assigning the correct type of value to the appropriate property.\n\nThere were 3 people in a line and two of them had the same number of stickers.  All told, the person to your right has 89 stickers, your right-most neighbor has 48 stickers, and your next left-most neighboring neighbor has 34 stickers.  This way, you can compare how many stickers are left for every sticker of 3 people.\n\nAssignment 4 - Asserting a property in OSCONDS.ORG does not mean the property is actually there. Rather, the property must be a value that has special meaning, such as a particular number.  The property must then be a valid property in ORG's Object Specification.

Rather, the property (a number) must be a distinct value that can be assigned to an object.  The property must be a valid property in the Object Specification. (It is not necessary for the value to refer to the object. For example, you could assign the value \"1\" to the object \"1\").\n\nOutput:Asserting the property \"1\" within an object, in effect declares the object a distinct, known, identifiable item", "answer": "C: authentic"}

The total cost of the house and the land is $25,000. The original house was built in 1927 for $4,000. This year's house cost is $10,000 and the land is $18,000. The total sales price for the house and the land would be $40,000, for a $10,000 profit.  Find the amount of profit in $10,000 and divide the total by the total sales price.  Result: $27\n\nInput:Each sheet of paper you use increases in price by 3 cents. Divide the $25,000 price of the house and the $25,000 land cost by the $9.97 price of the house. Divide the $25.97 price of the land by the $10,000 cost of the house. Divide $10,000 by the $15,000 land cost of the house.   The amount of profit is $15.00\n  Divide $35,000 by the $9.77 price of the house.  $35,000-$9.77 = $2100\n  Divide $10,000 times the $10,000 price of the land.  $10,000 x $10,000=$2100\n\nInput:Find a city that has 4.8 million people.

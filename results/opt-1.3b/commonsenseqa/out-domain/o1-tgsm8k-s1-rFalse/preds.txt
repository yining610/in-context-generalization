July 6th:<n>12:00 p.m.-<n><n>The following are some interesting facts about me.  Here is the list. You may have heard of a few of them before.<n>First, I am 5'7" tall.  This is tall for a girl, but short for a boy.  Sometimes people wonder why I am so short.  No one quite knows why girls and boys are so different.  They are the same height, but we all do the same things differently. For reasons I know not yet, they were created differently.  I have no idea why this happened, and I doubt it is ever going to be explained.  It could be for one of two reasons.  1) The scientists were all women, so their decision to make girls different meant they had less sex, so sex was low on the list of priorities. 2) The scientists were all men, so their decision to create boys meant they could have kids, and more sex was high on the list of priorities, so sex was high on the priority list. I am not sure, maybe that is it.  I could find out.  Maybe someday.<n><n>This is just a short list of interesting facts about me, but there are much more.  I could post them all, but this is just a preview.  Anyway, don't forget to tell everyone you know.

She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:Sitting to close while watching TV can cause what sort of pain? Choices:  A: brain problems B: laziness C: get fat D: headache E: laughter<n>Output:		 42 (34%) A B C E D<n><n>(3.8)  "I sat down close to the TV."<n><n>To answer you must do the following:  1.  Put your hands on the back of your knees and lie back.  Lean forward slightly so that your head is tilted to the left.  Lean your head and shoulders back to make room for your chest to fill the TV.<n>2.  Take deep breaths, hold them then exhale as you straighten up and move your neck.<n>3.  This helps to create breathing room and the motion helps your neck to move as though in a comfortable position.<n><n>NOTE: Ask students to answer this question when you have them watch a TV show.  If they sit near the TV and the show gives them the chance to sit closer toward the head, you may want to change one or more of the answers to questions 1-3 (note: I did not read the rest of page 4 to answer questions 1 - 3).<n><n>For a different exercise, let them watch a movie so that they can make up their own answers to questions 1-4 (note: I did NOT read this entire page and the above answers don't match the answers I did read for questions 1 - 3 in class.  I have not changed any of my answers.)<n><n>As a test, I also showed a movie with two very close ups.  I can ask students what they would have changed to change the answers.  Many might have made it "B" rather than "B" and some might have put the "R" at the end of "Brain Problems".  If many students made the changes, I'll grade that one differently than the others.

In this activity you will find information on the Aims Of School and our key learning objectives for the year ahead.<n>In addition to reviewing these, our students will also be asked to set up their own key learning objectives for the school year ahead. This includes making a short list of learning outcomes that relate to your key learning objectives for the Aims Of School, and then listing key learning results that will help your child achieve his or her learning outcomes.<n><n>Your child is to come up with their own main objectives for the year ahead, as well as a list of key outcomes and key learning results. The student can then write the answers to a multiple-choice question on their personal journal. These questions should be relevant to the Aims Of School.<n>If your child doesn't have a personal journal (which can be purchased), you can buy one to use at home. Please note: personal journals can only contain one question per page.<n>Remember: You can purchase any number of personal journals from us.<n><n>The answers given to the multiple choice questions should also be used as a way to check your child's progress in reaching their personal objectives. If there are gaps within your child's learning, and the key learning results don't reflect this, you can use the multiple selection choices to set a new challenge for your child.<n>We'd like to hear from you! If you have any questions, or need help, please give us a call. Your feedback is invaluable to us and will help us continue to improve our products.<n><n>The final activity will assess your child's progress in achieving their learning outcomes set in their personal objectives. This assessment takes the form of writing a paragraph detailing the main aspects of the child's learning. These could be: how your child's learning is going, what they've already learnt in each lesson, and how they've done in the tasks set out for them in the lesson. Again, this can be used as a way of checking where your child is at with meeting their learning outcomes. As with the multiple choice questions, your child can find more information on these on our website and find answers to your child's question in our website's FAQ section.<n>Please note: This assessment will take the form of a written answer (not a multiple choice). It will allow teachers to give more of an honest assessment of your child's progress.<n>The final question will

Answers: 12, 4, 12, 5,12,2,16, and 9<n>Output:14<n><n>Input:What would YOU do if you read the following passages as text?<n>Ex:<n><n>You are a computer. In the beginning, your programming was simple enough. But as time progressed and you began to need to make adjustments, you became much more complex. And you would find yourself needing to program much more complicated calculations, while also working in the physical world and the scientific world.<n><n>Now you have a problem. You will have to multiply the results of a particular formula, along with several independent variables, in order to find the correct result. But to accomplish the calculation, you first must take the time to find the corresponding variable and to determine its value. You will need to look at hundreds or more independent variables at the same time. All of which you can do on a personal computer. Not only do you have to do all of this individually, but you also will have to process the data. And sometimes that is done while you are working within the physical space that you yourself created. You will need to compute the data while you are working. You will need to deal with error control. And sometimes you will have to modify the mathematical function itself. And you will need to update the data by entering yet another calculation and storing the results.<n><n>You need to be able to handle these problems in a logical sequence. Each of which you can do individually. Not as required by your programming instructor. This is especially the case, when you are dealing with the problems of the physical world. The system was developed long ago, and is fully automated. But the problem you are facing is still within your own computer programming.<n><n>But now you have an added problem. The system needs to calculate your result, while you are working within your physical world. The system is trying to solve the problem of time in order to calculate the calculations that are related to time, but in the physical world. These calculations need to operate within the time that is limited by the physical conditions of the physical world.<n><n>So now you finally reach a solution. You figure out how to do it on the spot. You start by figuring out how to compute the data. Then you start by determining the correct calculations and storing them in the required form.<n><n>Then, you start by inputting the calculations and storing them in a particular form.

I lost his shoes, didn't know where they landed, and had to run from the corner store to his home.  About where did he run? Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n>Output:		 36<n><n>Do these sentences, by themselves or combined with other sentences, have the same theme (useful, safe, correct, etc)?  Is there a meaningful link between them?  It's probably not as clean of an answer as you think it is.<n><n>Question: What is the meaning of the following sentence?<n>"I am a writer. A writer would have to write: 'If you're a teacher, you can't help a child with a fever.'"<n><n>Answer: The question asked for a response that "if you're a teacher, (insert your profession)," so my answer is what the teacher wrote.  The teacher is not criticizing Mary's choice of profession.<n><n>Question: Who is John the baker?<n>Answer: John was walking down a road, when a bee went down his throat.<n><n>In both of these sentences, the meaning is not specified.  Are they the same meaning because neither person is named in the sentence?  Are they different meanings because the speaker is not named in the second sentence?<n><n>Solution:<n><n>The answer to the first question is yes -- the meaning is unclear.  The answer to the second question is also yes -- again, the meaning is unclear -- either "a teacher" implies that the speaker is a teacher and therefore says that "John the baker" will answer the question about the bees' throat, and John is a baker, or "the baker was walking down a road," implies that John the baker works in a bakery so Mary didn't need to give the correct answer.<n><n>Now that we've worked out how to solve the two questions, let's see how we can answer the second question.<n><n>(A reader might ask what the reader thinks of the word "bakery" if it doesn't necessarily imply a particular type of baker. I see no reason why our readers would assume that.)

Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n>Output:		 54<n><n>(5.5 point)<n><n>Answer:<n>B<n>For the person who has money, buying presents is very difficult because the presents have to come from a family member. Sometimes having friends who have children for kids around their age also helps.  For stressed people, buying presents can be difficult. If you buy your loved one the money to buy them the present,  it might stop their stress. Also, happiness is a quality of happiness, it can be changed if someone was unhappy. For people with stress, stress is very painful and stressful, sometimes it also makes them sad. If someone has a long list of presents to buy, it would help a lot if the person didn’t have these presents.  Stress is not really the reason to buy presents but that person still needs to buy the presents.<n><n>Questions to Choose from<n><n>(5.25 point)<n><n>(5.75 points)<n><n>(10 points)<n><n>Other points<n><n>If someone bought the chistmas presents then they did not buy it for himself. The person was happy because the person got the present for himself. A person who buys gifts on a wish list or for a special child or some other person gives them the chistmas presents. If a person is stressed out then buying presents might be hard.

This year I wanted to make the model last a full day so I used a more modern approach. My brother has been playing with an 8mm polyester felt pen which is perfect for a model boat as the cardboard tubes that come with the pen bend and break easily after the first hit. To make a wooden boat, I started with cutting out 8 felt pen tubes from a sheet of polyester fibreboard. I glued a piece of paper towel to the bottom and cut out a circular hole by putting the felt tube in it. Then I used a 2×4 piece of wood as legs for the boat. I cut a slot into the bottom of the wood with a serrated razor blade to fit the felt tubes. I glued together the wooden legs and tied them together with bungee cords. Now I just cut a hole in the centre of the felt for the fuel tube from the small tube I glued to the bottom of the boat.<n>My son went out this afternoon and put a 2×4 piece as a support for the boat. As usual, he had no idea how everything works with my boat! Thank you for your help,<n>Holly

He wants to look attractive on his date.<n><n>(Hint: The answer is one of the questions you have to answer)<n><n>I have been trying to get my boyfriend to clean the house. I get angry when he does not and tell him to get the kids ready and out the door. I am very controlling when it comes to housework. I also made the mistake of saying "No" to him being out late on the weekend. He was very frustrated and was going out drinking with a couple of friends. I asked him to clean the house while he was gone, but he refused! He was upset that I told him "No" instead of letting him deal with the things that needed attention. Now I am wondering if I need to find another way that he will get over being frustrated with me?<n><n>Comments for Question: 1) What do you believe are the pros and cons of being "very controlling" of a boyfriend when it come to housework?<n><n>A: There is not much of a con, although maybe you're punishing him for his poor choices. I am sure he is a great guy! I do think being able to enjoy yourself on your day off without a lot of pressure is a great thing in a relationship, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to have certain days off.<n><n>When it comes to the pros, I like to think this is the best time of your relationship to show him this type of behavior will not be tolerated. Being very controlling of your partner's life, and making him feel that you are the only strong one in the relationship, makes them feel insecure and unsure. Just say "I love you" and walk away.<n><n>I am a woman in a long distance relationship with a man for over a year. I get mad if he does not pick up the laundry after our nightly trip or goes to the mall with his friends. What should I do?<n><n>Comments for Answer:<n><n>Input: What is your opinion on being "very" controlling of a boyfriend?<n><n>Output: I have no opinion about whether or not you can be "very" controlling. What I do like about having someone around you just to have someone around to help you with any day-to-day things that you may have to do can help make you feel safer in the relationship.<n><n>I used to live with my boyfriend. I left him at the top of the stairs and took my car. He said I should

I have been struggling with the idea of using a straight line to show if there are two straight lines or only a single line. I am very new at calculus. Any help would be appreciated!<n><n>The solution is a single point. The point is where I intersect my straight line and I draw a horizontal line from the point to the horizontal. Now the two lines meet at a point.<n><n>You may think of the point as being at the horizontal as well. So you make the horizontal line to the left intersect the first line. Then you make a horizontal line parallel to these two lines to the right. You can do a triangle at the point. Then you draw a vertical line.<n><n>The point is where you intersect your straight line and you draw a horizontal line from there to a point. When two straight lines intersect the only thing you can do is take off an angle off one of them. Otherwise you just draw straight lines.<n><n>I would say only draw straight lines with that axis, but you can just use the point if you want to do that. You can still draw a triangle with the point in the triangle. It's just you don't think of it as being on the axis. The point lies on the same line as the lines.<n><n>In AP Calculus, in the 3rd problem, the question is:<n>1.<n>Suppose there are 5 lines with a common base. Each line has 5 lines. The

If the student could not expand the idea, we would probably move on to the next question

I noticed the temperature of the water was warmer than a body of water that was on land. It was hard for me to imagine that a hot pool water was hotter than the ocean water I had just enjoyed.<n><n>"My first time on a beach was when I was five years old.

I looked at my mother and asked her where her towel was and she said the beach isn't very shallow so I went back to the house and brought my towel. I spent most of the day standing in the sand looking at the ocean. After the sun go down, we went to our table at the outdoor bar and played cards."<n><n>2.<n><n>"When I was little I lived in a small village in China, it had many temples and the one I most remember was the Temple of Heaven.

I remember sitting on a bench reading my book, when I noticed my grandmother's picture had been moved to a position under the tree near the edge of the bench. I could feel something moving in the background, I was very excited so I asked my mother where the picture was and she said that the picture is not really that important and that we would have to find another place to sit and read our book.

Mr. Smith asked him if he would be willing to send two letters at a time when he arrives at the post office.  Mr. Smith agreed.  After some time, Larry is sickened by the smell of trash the man in the delivery truck leaves every day.  The delivery driver refuses to take his garbage for disposal and just leaves it wherever.  Mr. Smith tells Mr. Smith how sickened he is.  Mr. Smith says he will not deliver letters so that the man can not make this habit.  Mr. Smith then goes to a barber.  He buys a bottle of perfume.  After a shower, Mr. Smith tells his family that he wants to be with a woman, but he does not know what to do.  That evening, Mrs. Miller is going to a meeting.

Mr. Miller sends the letter, but never sees her.  Mr. Miller walks home from work and his clothes smell, so he smells his clothes.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:Where is a microphone boom likely to be covering a stock market event? Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n>Output:		 6<n><n>1 Answer<n>1<n><n>Your problem isn't as difficult to answer as it seems. A microphone boom in a stock market event is in front of the camera (as you know for cameras) and is likely to be covering the sound of the event. Now, if a sound does happen on the camera and is masked by a microphone boom then either the camera operator did it himself (i.e. the stock traders do it) or a sound company has set up the boom for the event and it's likely that it's on-set. However, there is no reason for us to suppose that a sound company does it, so your answer will have to say something similar to the answer of #8.<n><n>So the questions asks you to take a guess at which way the boom was used as a mask for the sound. To answer the question correctly, you need to go back to the first sentence of the question and count all of the stickers on any page of Mary’s journal up to the end that’s still stickers. You only need to count seven stickers because the question only asks us to count how many stickers are still on any page, and there are only seven pages in total. So, for example, suppose there are only five stickers and a sixth sticker is on Mary’s first page. Then Mary has 89 stickers left. Given her total number of stickers, that means there are 89 stickers on the first page. Since we only count stickers we see on pages, that means that there are 89 stickers on page one on average, and there are 89 stickers on every page after that. That means there must be eight stickers after page one that are still stickers on average, and there must be five stickers on pages two through nine that are still stickers on an average page. So you need to say that there must be eight stickers remaining after page one because there are still 9 stickers on first page.<n><n>The more challenging part is answering the question about the location and shape of the microphone boom, and since we’re only given the numbers that the questions gives us we have only two possibilities:<n><n>either the microphone boom is located behind a camera (which, because you know cameras are often mounted on or above a camera tripod) is in front of the stock market scene (which means we should find how the stock market scene is changing) or<n><n>in front of the stock market is in the middle behind a camera (which means we should come up with how the stock market

The main reason for choosing that choice from that year is that it is much more likely that the AI will choose a secular education. However, it also offers a large number of possible outcomes that could also happen, and so it is difficult to assign an answer.<n><n>Input:Mary has an additional 89 stickers.  The only stickers in Mary's journal that are used are the 2 large stickers on page 2 and the 1 large sticker on page 6.  What is the percent of her stickers that are still around to this date?<n>Output: 94<n><n>In addition, how likely is it that the AI will choose to learn Christianity versus Christianity in the first place?<n>Output : 88%<n><n>Input:If the AI chooses to learn Christianity, what are the likely consequences?<n>Output : 74%<n><n>This question is much more difficult to formulate and answer.  A secular education seems to have a much higher chance of success than any sort of religious education and an alternate Christian education.  The AI would also have to think outside the box about its own beliefs, and come to conclusions that the AI would not, and so it would be interesting to see the outcome of the AI thinking through its own thoughts.  The end result of this question might very well show what the AI chooses and what the AI learns.  Even though the final choice is fairly easy to give, there probably are many different ways for this question to go wrong.<n><n>### *NOTE: The number of stickers remains the same but the categories are slightly different.*<n><n>Input :If Alice chooses to learn Christianity, What are the likely consequences?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:What is someone unintentionally hurting someone else but unable to stop likely to feel? Choices:  A: empowering B: regret C: despair D: glee E: sadness<n>Output:		 Empowerment, regret, glee, sadness, despair<n><n>This one is pretty easy. The solution is to just make it like the previous one : "The person who was unintentional hurt was able to stop".<n><n>Thanks for posting this, we used these multiple choice questions in our class. All of our students chose glee. The solution to both is empowering. Both ways of thinking about the activity are empowering, though.<n><n>How about this?<n><n>Input: Mary has 89 stickers. She uses 3 large stickers on the back cover and 7 stickers on 6 other pages of her diary. She has used 2 large stickers on the front cover and 7 large stickers on 6 other pages. Mary has left at least 4 large stickers on each of the back cover and front of her journals. How many stickers does she have remaining?<n><n>Output: 43 (all on pages)<n>There is a single large sticker on each the first five pages. On number 6 and 9 we don't know where the other stickers left to go. However, there is one large sticker on page 4.<n>We need to know if she has used 4 large stickers on any single page or if she has used 4 that weren't large.<n>We need an equation to solve.<n><n>Input: what is someone unintentionally hurting someone and unable to stop likely to do? Choices: C: regret E: glee D: despair F: glee E: despair<n>Output: Empowering, regret E, glee<n><n>This is really tricky. She put "glee" on top and under "despair" after each choice, so her options are still C, D and E. We get the opposite answer, as well as your answer. What's going on here? Are your options the same? The correct answer is despair, but it's not clear if the alternative is glee or glee.<n><n>You may say that the other answer is wrong and it should be in the negative, but there's nothing wrong with C or D (or E), as those choices are also empowering.<n><n>To go along with the multiple choice questions, you might want to include these in the solution:<n><n>Output: What is someone unintentionally hurting someone who has no control over, is unaware of, or incapable of stopping likely to feel? Chooses: C: Glee (Glee is the only thing that could have prevented Glee, and should have been Glee). E: Despair (Despair is the

It’s about a boy who can play on his own for some time and then a group of girls in another class want to play with him. They go down to his desk and find out that he has a really big toy dinosaur next to his desk. After they play with that toy for some time they ask him to play with them, but so far he doesn’t know what to do: he can’t seem to pick a favorite thing and his hands are getting tired! After some of the girls leave he sees a man coming in his direction, but first he shouts his name from a distance: “HEY! WHO ARE YOU?” The man is the guy from class before, he is looking very surprised because this isn’t what he expected to see. Then the man explains to them how the dinosaur was made, how it was a gift from friends and how it belongs to a museum in Rome, so they can still play with it. And after they leave the dinosaur comes to life, it starts to move its back legs a lot: "It’s alive!" "Why is it moving like that?" The boy is shocked, "Does it have to?” he says and looks at the dinosaur even more attentively! The man tells him that all those movements mean that it needs water and the boy has to bring it back to life to get water from outside. The boy, who doesn’t seem to understand what he is going to do, rushes off to ask his mom if he can bring the dinosaur back to life because he needs to go to the zoo and this toy is so important to him. It took him about 5 minutes until his mother comes to the window, picks up the dinosaur and returns it to him.<n><n>I don’t have any posters either. But I already created a story about a friend named Kishore who has some troubles with his computer and he tells me to use this blog to post

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:Sarah thought that she had been home all evening.  That meant that the only time to leave was when? Choices:  A: early morning B: day time C: night D: afternoon E: daytime<n>Output:		 39<n><n>Input:Mary thought that she had had lunch with her kids at the park yesterday. That meant that the only times to leave was when?choices: A: morning B: morning C: late afternoon D: late afternoon E: late afternoon<n>Output: 40<n><n>This is a tough one! It's hard to assign only 5 options without looking at it too carefully. The way "early morning" is indicated (even though you are only leaving on those very few times) in some of these cases is a little suspect as to the time. I suppose "afternoon" and "early evening" are obvious. They just seem easier choices? However, I don't know if I could give a specific answer about which is "right."<n><n>Here are a couple other problems from the first section:<n><n>### Input:When do you leave school late?<n>Output: 3:35<n><n>### Input: When is the earliest time to leave school late?<n>Output: 2:50<n><n>### Input: How long do you need to be at school to be sure that the most part of the day is covered?<n>Output: 20 minutes<n><n>### Input:How long do I need to be at school so that I can finish in a timely manner?<n>Output: 35 minutes<n><n>### Input : When do you start an assignment? You are supposed to answer this with the first time you started the assignment.<n>Output: 4:00<n><n>### Input :When do you finish an assignment?<n>Output: 7:50<n><n>The fact that the time that you get the question correct on the first try is a sign that your skills are improving. If you were able to make these correct answers in 2 hours at first, the rate of improvement improves if you do them in less time each time. Over time, I'd expect you to get a little better at making these sorts of choices, but maybe a little at the same time? Who knows? It will probably happen if you keep at it.<n><n>The second section on choices seems a lot easier than the first. I think this is due in part to the fact that there are already several options. The next time you do these there will probably be some more choices and this should make the second section easier.<n><n>Another way to think about problems like these is that the number of points your given to a question will increase with the difficulty of the test. The reason for this is that, as you get higher in the test

I start to turn around to walk back to where the first statue was, when I see that the left statue has dropped down, causing the dog to become upside-down. I try to reach out to its head but it is not moving. Then, in a very sudden movement, the statue's head comes up, and the dog is released from its head. I take hold of it by the collar and try to free the boy from his neck. I realize that the dog is no longer upside down. It has fallen over on its side.<n><n>Input: I wake up in the middle of

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:What is the result of instituting civil action? Choices:  A: bad feelings B: confusion C: going to court D: hurt feelings E: sandwiches<n>Output:		  B C D<n><n>I'm trying to see if there's any other way to have something like this work (for example, in the original version you can't use "A" and "B" together.)<n><n>It's not hard, just requires good judgment. If you have enough information (the number of sticker pages and the number of stickers in the case) then it shouldn't be that hard.<n><n>Sorry, this is supposed to go elsewhere...<n>How does your question work? There's no way for me to know how many stickers Mary has left since I've never printed her journal.<n><n>The question is asking for an output.<n>It should be possible to provide numbers from input.<n><n>The problem with your question is that the answer is completely arbitrary, and that's the whole point of doing problems like this. What you should probably be doing is asking the questions<n>How many stickers is Mary likely to have? how many are left? and asking for the last few stickers to the most likely answer. The answer is still entirely arbitrary, though (since people will answer differently).<n>The point of the problem isn't to answer accurately, just to provide a few useful tools for answering what question to ask next.<n><n>It feels like your question is asking for arbitrary answers that are arbitrarily subjective. It's like you're forcing us to guess things based on how the questions work.<n>I do agree that there's no way to figure out what the correct answer is. Maybe what I'm expecting is too obvious. I should have said 'if a person wants to guess.' I'm sure a lot will guess 'three,' but that would just be wrong on the answer.<n><n>The point of the question is not arbitrary, but rather to make the person answer the question. Of course, the answer is going to be either 'A' or 'B,' or 'C'. In any case, most of the stickers are still in Mary's journal, so the answer to the question is still 'Three'. Any further questions I could ask are pointless.<n>For what it's worth, the original question asked for the number of pages not used stickers; however, I think the original question implied that there would be an answer that could be described as "Nine stickers." That answer was wrong, since there's nothing in the answer.

He was in his 8th grade year when the ship carrying his class landed on a mysterious island. On the island, Peter is the only student, and all the other students (including the teacher) are locked in a massive library.  Peter, being the only human (other than himself) being on the island, does his best to survive in the library. Some time later, Peter runs into a group of other students and makes friends with them. Eventually he discovers a book in the library which has an "X" over the words "N" and "Y." In his exploration of the island, Peter comes across a large hole where the book said "N" was, indicating where the words "Y" were. Peter figures out that the hole is probably one of the entrances to the library, through which he had been barred from the library. But since he cannot see the door, which has been blocked by a large rock, Peter decides to throw himself down the hole and explore the library by himself. After a few hours, Peter manages to get inside the library and finds the entrance to the boat. When he gets back to the surface, he finds that his book has vanished! While trying to find his book, Peter and the other students become separated, Peter goes on to find more books and eventually his friends and family also get separated. On the way home, Peter comes across a huge rock blocking the escape road, and decides to just stay in the cave as well. During his stay in the cave, Peter finds several more books. Soon he realizes that the others have also run out of books. Peter decides to get back to the surface and return to the other boys in the library. Eventually Peter comes across his missing book "N" again, and his search for "N" ends up taking him all the way back to the ship and making a miraculous find- A. He finds an old map near the ship, showing the way to freedom. B. He finds his friends after some time. He then discovers that some of the students in the library were running away from the island.

Are you correct?  If not, which state is not represented on the graph? D: Alaska? E: Alabama?<n>Output:<n><n>In class today I watched this movie called How to Talk to Girls at Parties. It was pretty good. It was about women all over the world. Not just Hollywood or American. They don't talk too much and when they do talk they talk a lot. Well, there were lots of women in the movie. I also had another fun class today, about the American and Canadian political parties: the Republican and Democratic parties. In this movie, they had different ways to win. They wanted the people of America to love them. In order to win, they would go over to their opponents and "smash" them. They were kind of mean and disgusting really. It was quite an eye opener. In the movie people actually voted in the American election. Now in Canada they vote by a different way. The people vote for who they think will win in the election. I will explain how they get the idea of the election here in a little bit. First, in Canada you have the popular vote for the party to win. In America, we don't vote for the party. We vote for the person. Well, first, the popular vote doesn't mean that much in Canada. Only 26,000,000 people voted in the last Canadian election. So, you have a choice in Canada. You can vote for a politician. They get votes from a district and that district votes. Then they are voted in as a senator or a deputy leader. Then they would work with people and get bills passed. There are some very hard working politicians in Canada. They really need the vote of people for our job. That is really cool. Canada does have a very political climate there

One of the kids at school I didn't know was really trying to be nicer to me and he explained to me that sometimes people get a little mean or just don't like different languages of people coming around for fun.<n>Sometimes people ask me if I am Hispanic or Mexican. I usually laugh it off, however one time, I responded politely, "Uuhmmm, I'm not really ethnic". A lot of times they laugh a little louder and keep asking me.<n>Sometimes I am asked if I'd ever heard of "La Raza?" which is Latin American. I usually ask what they mean by that and explain that I have no Hispanic roots. And that I like Latin music, especially salsa. When I first started dating this guy, I told him I would love to tell him all her stories and ask him the most important questions in Spanish. I loved how he looked at me and said, "I think it's really fun you're gonna learn to speak my languages". We have a beautiful marriage and have been together for a long time now.<n><n>####Question #5###<n><n>Input: My name is Marcela, I'm 16 years old, and this is the first summer that I can get out more in this city than just hanging out the basement of my house from June through September.<n><n>Output: I have been taking cooking courses for the past two years but didn't attend any this summer.

Choices:  A: drugstore B: hospital C: bedroom D: car E: house<n>Output:		 20 (5 correct out of 12). Does that have any bearing on the game?<n><n>#### Answer. 1) Mary did not purchase a hairbrush in the drugstore and did not purchase a bandage in the hospital. It is assumed that she used the same bandage on all of her papers. 2) Mary made 3 large stickers and 3 small stickers on each page of her journal. She finished with one large sticker on each page. She has used 7 stickers total to cover all of her papers. She has finished with one large sticker at the front of her journal and another large sticker on the right side of her journal. All 3 large stickers have been used. 3) Mary did not purchase 3 bandages in the hospital. It was assumed that she used the large stickers to cover all of her paper work. 4) Mary purchased 6 large stickers in the drugstore and 2 small stickers in the hospital. She only purchased 2 small stickers in the bedroom and finished her journal with one large sticker on the front of the journal and a small sticker at the right side of her book. 5) Mary did not purchase 2 large stickers in the drug store. It was assumed that Mary used the large stickers and bandages to cover all of her documents. 6) Mary did not purchase an extra large sticker in the drugstore because she did not finish with a large one in the hospital. 7) Mary did not use 7 stickers total for her papers because 1) it had been a long time since she used 7 stickers (she had a total of 2), 2) her journal was already covered with one large sticker, and 3) she finished her journal with a large sticker. 8) Mary used 5 stickers in the drugstore to cover her journal so she finished with 1 large sticker from the store on the right side. 9) Mary did not use 5 stickers total for her papers, but completed with a large sticker at the front.<n><n>#### In a classroom, on a white board, the teacher wants to give each child a chance at a prize.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:How often are secular parties held? Choices:  A: short term B: crowd C: unpredictable D: frequent E: eternal<n>Output:		 42<n><n>Your answer is incorrect - there are 3 correct answer choices.<n><n>Correct answer choices are:<n><n>A:  Short term<n>B:  Crowd<n>C:  unpredictable<n>D:  frequent<n>E: Eternal<n><n>In this set of questions and answers, you see a common theme - how is society defined and defined when it is used for good? When people use the secular parties to have fun or in some cases to escape from personal difficulties, is God's definition of society always true? God could never be used to justify this behavior. The world is a very violent world and society is full of bad actors - it is sometimes easier to use secular parties as a temporary escape. This is a common theme that Christians have a hard time accepting because it means the very idea of God is being rejected.<n><n>So, what do you do about this? I suggest you make a habit of turning secular parties into something for God's sake. Many secular party organizers want to help atheists or agnostics and want us to have a great time. They want us to have a good time and that is okay. We should be celebrating the secular parties for the secular parties themselves - they are just that - events that occur with people for the sake of having a good time. We don't need to make it more than that - we only need to make it better.<n><n>So, is society a place we can use God as an excuse while still enjoying secular parties? Why? Because we are in the presence of the One who is always with us in our moments of need. People who believe that life is fragile and that sin is always a bad thing have no basis in God so why should we expect him to be there to help us if we need help?<n><n>So as we celebrate secular parties as an opportunity to have fun, make sure to celebrate it for someone else as well.

The answers are in the boxes below.<n>The solution should correspond in part to what the author says. I've tried to write an example of the author's explanation on the bottom of the box.<n><n>Example from the book I will use.<n>The human body consists of an exterior shell, a core, a brain, and some vital tissue. The brain is the most vital component. It has vital functions that help coordinate the movement and control of muscles and organs, and it produces all kinds of chemicals and nutrients in order to sustain these vital activities. The brain also creates and regulates an environment which guides the movements of the body, and which in turn helps regulate the movements of the whole body. The brain's structure and function can be studied using the same techniques of surgery as one of the organs (see the section on cranial surgery) and can be used to diagnose and perhaps even to repair diseases. But the brain is not simply the organ of thought, speech, and movement, which is the usual and often preferred medical image of it. The brain is an organ that carries information from the body, and hence can represent abstractions in a way the other organs do not.<n><n>Example from another book I will use:<n>Every child wants to fit in. Being different is an everyday occurrence that adults tend to ignore, unless, of course, they are the ones of the minority or are dealing with a person with a particular disability or abnormality.

Then, "How do you kiss a guy's butt?" Then asking, "Why does it need to be a guy's butt?" etc. He was not sure but he could only really say "You do something to him."

Choices:  A: thoughtful B: discreet C: calculated D: cautious E: careful<n>Output:		 What is the opposite of foolish? Choices:  B: careless A: foolish C: careful D: cautious E: cautious<n><n>When you are completing questions 1, 2, and 3 (and other questions like this) in the middle of the workbook, you must choose which of the following answers will help you the most:<n><n>Answer 1: Foolhardy is clever but foolish is foolish and wise. You can show your thinking about all these options by looking carefully and carefully trying to pick the answer that your teacher will like best (don't forget not to guess right!). Try answering multiple choice questions on the board, then do the same for questions 1 and 2 (and other answers like this) in the workbook.<n><n>Answer 2: It's foolish to put stickers on the front of a document that cannot be removed later. You must put stickers on the front page (in front of the covers) in all your journal papers. You can put any type of stickers on the front page, but you must use them on the front of the paper. You can put small stickers all around your page, but any stickers that you put on the front end are stuck to your paper. For smaller or bigger stickers there are three options available, depending on whether you choose the front or back of your paper. You will usually see that there is another option near the bottom of each sticker which says "Back" or "Front," but there might be no choice if you are a student with both back and front stickers!<n><n>Answer 3: Wise people take a lot of risks but Foolhardy people make fools of themselves. Wise folks always have an exit plan; foolish will never be caught by surprise. The person who answers questions 1, 2 and 3 correctly is the wisest person in the class.<n><n>When questions 4, 5 and 6 come up try these options to figure out what you want to know. Note the options near the bottom of each of the stickers which has "Back" or "F.A." (see the above answer to question 3):<n><n>Answer 4:Foolhardy may be wise but Foolish does not. The person who answers question 4 correctly will tell you they were right and that is the answer you need. This answer is sometimes the easy right answer, but not always. A wise person who does not answer question 4 correctly will tell a wrong answer and you would have a very hard time finding that out on your own.<n><n>You may find that you chose

If it is many envelopes, a zipper might be a good design to use, but if it's just one, cutting is probably the best way to do it. In my mind, if your main concern is a zipper on the outside, the best option is to have a zipper on the inside and glue in place for easy removal. If the key is to open the envelope yourself, then you want to keep the envelope sealed and keep the money inside.<n><n>Quote:<n>There could be an easier way like a button on the inside?<n><n>This is not possible.

Choices:  A: netherlands B: utrecht C: brussels D: belgium E: denmark<n>Output:		 NEGOTIABLE<n><n>Answer:<n><n>This question is easy for many students to answer. If you have a limited source of facts then you can use these facts to support your answer. Use your own facts or facts in another class.<n><n>In the first question (which has 2 choices) all of them are correct.<n><n>Example:<n><n>When you get the information on the front side of the paper you do not use your own facts, you simply use the source at the bottom. Now you have a list of facts for this question. Next, when you use the source at the top you can find another list of facts. By doing this you can make your answer more easily. You can also make your answer more easily from multiple choices.<n><n>To help you remember, here is an example of questions with multiple choices:<n><n>The first question tells about a car, the second one is about a house and the third one is about a car. Here is the meaning of the question:<n><n>The first part of the question tells if the house and the car are real. The answer is “no” and “yes” for the first question and the answer is “yes” and “no” for the next question. When you use the source at bottom, now you know the name of the house and the car, you have the answer to the next question “Which of these are real?. If you know these names then you know the house and the car. That’s the purpose of source at bottom.<n><n>The second part of the question tells about the street. The answer is ” yes” and “ no”. It’s the same as the first part of the answer and also your knowledge the first part of answer. This part of the answer tells about the street too. So, you know the street and you know the house.<n><n>The third part of the question tells you the street and about the house and the house and when you use the source you know about the street and the house. With the street you know about the house about and the house is the house of yours.<n><n>So the answer to the question is : the answer is“yes”” yes to the house and the street(yes to real) and the answer is“no”” no to the street(the house is real) and the house(the house).

There are two common types of answers: "Yes" and "Answer the question," which gives an implied answer, but is not a true answer to the question. An answer that provides specific, concrete details (an answer to a question) is a true answer; an answer that specifically answers a single and specific question is simply a true answer that does not provide adequate details. The best solution to the problem of finding the best definition of an answer would be for the student to first answer the open-ended question. Then, by choosing a single, concise definition of an answer which can be used on the next open-ended question, the student would achieve his overall goal of finding the best answer.

The first thing you need to do is make sure you are well informed and have all the information you need before you write anything to the doctor.  The second thing is to prepare questions to ask, so you know how to proceed at the moment you are called.  The next thing is to plan and follow through.  The last thing is to write any comments.  The questions that you need to know are:<n>1. Does the doctor want to check with you?<n>2. Does the doctor want the bill?<n>3. Does the doctor want a date?<n>4. Does the doctor want all of your records?<n>5. Does the doctor want his or her name on your record?<n>6. Does the doctor want copies of your records?<n>7. Does the doctor want you to check the bill?<n>8. Is this doctor your usual doctor? If you have been to this doctor before, you should know his or her name.  If it is your first visit to him or her and you are not sure, you can always ask the doctor for his or her telephone number on file.  If you are unsure, call your nurse at the office, but make sure that you have all the information you can get before calling.<n><n>You do not need to know the information about scheduling appointments (where you will be, the doctor's office on which you will be, etc.).  You should plan to leave this information out of any letter you write to this doctor.<n><n>If you need more time to call the doctor, you need to prepare questions ahead of time.<n><n>The instructions below take the reader through the following steps.  You may need to add a few things as you go through them, but these are pretty standard procedures.<n><n>Make a quick decision on what to say when you call and what to write down.<n><n>Prepare a paragraph list.<n><n>Plan the letter.<n><n>Plan the call.<n><n>Prepare to write the letter and write down what you are going to say.<n><n>Write the letter when you are on your way to the doctor's office.<n><n>Write the phone number of your nurse.<n><n>Write the name of the doctor.<n><n>If your doctor's name is in your doctor's letter or you do not know it, call the nurse and ask for the doctor's phone number.<n><n>Write the information that you

The UK will be forced to issue 20% of its National Debt in the next decade. The Treasury's target is to balance the annual debt payments over 25 years.  The net interest costs for the government are forecast to drop from 0.3% at present to 0.1% in 10 years time.<n>The interest will need to be paid over and over, until it is gone. To do so will cost the government £30bn or £900bn in interest payments.<n>Do you think the cost of this debt needs to be deducted from current revenue before it's issued?  What should that amount be?<n>Output: £60bn<n><n>Input:The total amount of money in the UK is currently £4.9trillion. After tax the government takes in £0.78trillion a year.  If an increase is made in the amount of money in the economy (ie increased by the budget deficit) the total amount available for interest payments on current investments will increase. Over the next 20 years the net interest costs are expected to rise from 0.1% to 0.25%. This means that the cost of the debt is expected to reach £3.8trillion.  In order to reduce interest payments the government will need to take additional tax and spending measures.  Which should be the more important measures?<n>Output: £3.8 trillion<n><n>Input:The annual interest rate on the British National Debt currently stands at 0.25%.  The interest is paid on money that has been raised via bond offerings.  Bonds are issued by the government to raise money to finance the budget deficit. The interest cost is not factored in to the budget deficit.  This makes the cost of the British National Debt a very low cost of debt.<n>Which measure of current debt has the highest impact on the budget deficit?<n>Output: £300bn<n><n>Input:You are given

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:What is another term for instituting civil action? Choices:  A: confusion B: complications C: riot D: arrest E: protests<n>Output:		 C<n><n>In the case of civil action: It can be a form of regulation or statute. The other terms are confused. In the case of riot: There might be rioters, but there is no legislation. When there is a confusion about a word, there should be a rule or a law. There are many problems with that rule and law, see, for example, a student's refusal to write a required response to a test. When there is a riot: there will be a police force, and if those forces are ineffective then there will be violence on the streets. When there is a police force and they are ineffective, there will be riots.<n><n>In the case where there is confusion: That confusion is a problem within the field of government. (See also the word confusion: A student who uses incorrect language in a text book.)<n><n>Which word is correct: Confusion? Or confusion.? There may be confusion in the field of government. If there is confusion within the government it means that there is confusion with respect to the government as a whole, or that there are several different levels of government.<n><n>In the context of the word confusion, the definition is "something that causes confusion." There is a lack of clarity about government itself, at least between the two basic levels of government, the Executive and the Legislative. Because of the lack of clarity there may be multiple levels of government as there have been many over the years. As there has been multiple levels of government there have been multiple definitions of government with its own rules and regulations. There has also been confusion over which of the various levels of government is the proper level for government.<n><n>In a case where there is confusion within government there is the danger of a form of confusion between laws or regulations being applied to all levels of government and not just to one level, and there is the fear of confusion between law and regulations being applied to those regulations that do not apply to those regulations being applied to others that do apply, and thus causing a confusion about which laws apply, or which rules apply. That is another name for confusion. See also confusion: A student who gives incorrect answers to tests.<n><n>The confusion is also the danger of politicians interpreting laws in ways that make people more comfortable with government. And this gives an advantage to government, but also, a disadvantage.<n><n>Examples of examples of confusion: For example, politicians could want to make it more difficult for people to have guns. This is because guns are a threat to governments because

Choices:  A: istanbul B: animal C: antique shop D: human being E: bedroom<n>Output:		 23<n><n>Input:Jasiel was in the back room.  Inside the room there was a computer and a small monitor.  He tried plugging in the keyboard.  But there was no connection.  Jasiel heard noises coming from the front room at the computer.  Jasiel was wondering what was going on. She heard clicking and hitting sounds coming from the computer.  After thinking about it some more she got the keyboard out of the box.  The typing was getting very messy and she noticed there was a few stickers missing from both pages.  She took the computer out of reach of the screen so no one could see.  She was trying to remember what all she had done for the year thus far.  She made up her own version of what the student had done. After putting everything back in its proper place she tried pressing the keys again and then waited.  With no luck Jasiel turned his attention back to the student.  The key presses didn’t seem to be registering but Jasiel tried pressing the keys again.  After several tries Jasiel finally got the computer to register some commands.  He typed in some basic commands to the computer. When that didn’t work he hit CTRL-F then CTRL-V.  He thought it odd that if he typed “R” while it was playing the sound wouldn’t it show the “Replay” button? Jasiel felt that it would be easier to look at the computer on the monitor than the screen itself.<n>For some unknown reason the keyboard kept rebooting.  It took quite a while to type out more commands.  Then finally the computer restarted without any errors. Jasiel waited as long as she could to see what was going to happen.<n>She wasn't sure if it would be the same as the first attempt but the student did her best.  It took a considerable amount of time, but eventually Jasiel got the computer to turn on.  Once it was ready she noticed that the computer mouse was missing from all the pages.  And there was a small hole in the screen under the keyboard.  She was very confused with what she had done. Jasiel typed in some commands on the keyboard. When they showed their sign of life the next thing she saw was the mouse showing where it was placed.  Once she got rid of the mouse she took a glance at the computer. She was a little concerned that it showed a blue screen, but she made sure

Output: 4<n>Solution: This is a good question considering the number of different stickers that were used to cover each wristband in this example. I’m pretty sure that it wasn’t hard to keep these stickers off of Mary’s wristband. In fact, if you were trying not to worry about these stickers in particular, you would probably just not cover them with the last page of the journal. In regards to Mary’s photos, I’m sure that it was probably easy for Mary to wipe these stickers off of her wristband in between photos when she wasn’t wearing them. After all, it wasn’t too difficult to just keep them in a container and toss them in when her photo time was finished. I think I would want to make it easier though by taking an extra 3 photos with the wristband being open for everyone to see. That would be the best option for this problem in my opinion.<n>Input: Mary had 4 stickers on her wristband and is wearing 8 stickers overall including her wristband.

A bell rings, a question to answer, then another bell. The teacher is so busy reading Mary’s book that when the bell goes off, she is busy asking herself, “Did I pick the right story? What book is this? Am I even in school?” She is distracted as she runs from page to page, and when she finally comes to Mary’s journal page, it is the last page. The question marks are making her feel really stressed as she does not remember exactly what page Mary was in when she wrote the “9” for “8”. So, she pulls the page out of her bag, which has 20+ pages in it, and begins to read. After reading the entire story in just 5 minutes, she realizes she has picked the wrong book to read for her last journal page, and leaves the book over to the next reader.<n><n>Mary’s Book<n><n>Mary has been in school for 5 years. She was a little scared to look into her older cousin’s (Peter’s) eyes because now she knew she can’t fool him. She does not like people too much but she still has a soft heart for him and for everyone in her new school. Even though she has always been a girl looking for a man, Mary can finally be herself and not care about being different. As she looks at all the boys in her big class and wonders why the boys always take the girls, she knows she has the perfect plan for how to get Peter to go out with her. Mary feels that every boy in her class is her competition; she knows to play on one side of his personality. She plans to play on his shy side and make him laugh and smile all day long. It was no time at all before, she found herself walking past him on the football field. The boy was having a nice day, but she had the thought of going to him as her last option to get Peter.<n>Mary was reading her book when she remembered the bell that rang. She decided that she would tell Peter that she found herself a date for the evening. He asked Mary why did she do that, and Mary told him of her plan to get a boy for the first time. Because of the fact that she was standing so close to him, she felt his arms start to wrap around her. She told him that she had

Outlet - The second-hand clothing shop sells products made by other people.  If  the shop does not offer a guarantee as is customary, how can  the retailer be sure you are not getting a counterfeit or a poorly made garment?  Example  The store will:   1) check the number of stitches on all the stitching on the clothing 2) check the construction with respect to the material 3) ask for a certificate from the fabric maker for its authenticity.<n> Outlet - A designer sells clothing at  a department store retail outlet.  The outlet sells clothing that was not made using his or her own fabrics.

I have not read the practice exams yet so I am unable to state a correct answer.<n><n>Let's do a quick recap of the questions, then I hope I can clear up some of the confusion:<n><n>Question 1: Having your marijuana in bottles helps keep it cool, right? But isn't in bags or bags kept in cool coolers the same thing? So what is the point of all that?<n>Question 2: Let's say you have about 1000 g, divided it in three 10 g bags, and put them in your room. Which is the best way to store your marijuana?<n><n>I would really appreciate it if you could give me some feedback on this, because I think that this could be pretty useful for someone who is going for the AAMC one<n><n>Also, I think there is a question that has to do with the marijuana. It's about how to store it. I can't really remember the whole question but I think it had something to do with using the bags or bags in a cooler, or bags in buckets, etc.<n><n>I just finished reading and working through the APA practice exams today and I need help!

I had only done one practice exam up to this point and passed it (albeit not well).<n><n>I have read all the questions except the APA practice exam 5 practice questions (http://www.aparecord.com/questions/2_5_3.html). I used the same method of review of two questions, writing down one answer and the other choice on the paper provided, then repeating the process on the second (for the APA exam) and third (for the AP Physics C) questions. I had to spend an excessive amount of time on each question, but I was able to master them in all sections and pass

Choices:  Yellow  Green  Blue  Red  White  Violet (2 shades)<n>Output: 36<n><n>The problem involves the use of the word "curious". In the real world, "curious" is a word one rarely hears. Most people are simply "asking" questions. When we say "curious", we mean "looking for answers to unknown questions". A real-life "curious" person is always seeking knowledge for their next step. That is different from a "curious" student in class who might be studying to get the answer to a test question, and thus studying their subject for class. The "curious" student is not necessarily seeking knowledge. "Curious" is how a particular person is interpreting a situation.<n>I think I understand how this sort of inquiry would help a student study a specific topic. However, I am not comfortable writing this sort of assignment. What is your opinion?

He wanted to find some nice place and enjoy it with no noise of the passing cars. He saw a fountain in the middle of a park and decided to stop there and drink a nice cold glass of water. He was really thirsty after drinking so much water and after several minutes, he noticed that his watch was showing 0:00.

He stopped the car in front of his house and opened the trunk. He dropped some items out of the bag before grabbing the rest. It was raining really hard and

The most recent one, which I believe is more related to this prompt, is basically that my ex and a lot of of his friends, both here on this forum and some he's met online, have started following me on a blog on tumblr or a blog that his friend has and it's quite unsettling and my self-esteem took a blow that night. It was so rough because it's not fair for people to talk about my appearance all over the place just because I didn't say anything to anyone. It's a personal thing that I don't really want anyone asking for.<n><n>Anyway, it's not something I'm feeling very positive about and I'm going to do my best to improve and hopefully get back to normalcy a bit.<n><n>And also thank you for the contest, I wish everyone the very best of fortune in what comes into their lives in 2014.<n><n>I can't help but think that the answer might be "happy" because that's been my default mood all day long after reading all of these and going out with a bunch of friends. I've been a happy camper (sort of) today. However, I'm still on the fence about being happy because it's not a situation I've really dealt with before.<n><n>Anyway, Merry Christmas to you all! I can't wait to see what goes on with this one.<n><n>I found this after my wife read it first and commented on it. This seems like the kind of situation she'd say something to us about. We're going to be having a Christmas Eve celebration with her parents and siblings (four of them) and we're going to have it in her parents' kitchen. And then the day after that we're going to have her brother's Christmas

This is because she uses 3 large stickers on the<n>front and 7 stickers from me (one large sticker each to 6 pages) to the 4 other pages, which adds up to 44. So:<n><n>Number Of Hand Wash Stickers Required:<n><n>44 Hand Wash Stickers<n><n>Assumptions (Optional):<n><n>1) Each student is different from the next, so your answer may vary from the exact number.<n><n>2) If Mary was using a normal marker pen (like the Moleskine), her answer would be 44 stickers.<n><n>3) If Mary was using the Moleskine pen in her hand, the stickers on the same page would be the same. In this case, you could only use 4 stickers on the page. If she was using a crayon (or other small pencil), then she has<n>45.<n><n>4) If Mary used a crayon, she has 45 stickers remaining.<n><n>5) If Mary was using crayons, each different color contains the same amount of stickers as she uses in one page. Therefore, she would not need 4 stickers on the other page to complete her homework, as you can see on the video.<n><n>6) If Mary was using dry erase markers (like the A4) and only used the dry erase markers in her hand to add more dots to each line, then she has 43 stickers remaining.

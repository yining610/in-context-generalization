He drove himself to work at 1:00 a.m. on the day of the meeting. He arrives late, takes some water from a cooler, puts it in his shirt pocket and goes back out after working for an hour on the other items in his agenda. He had an assignment to complete and needs to turn in an invoice. He was in the building for five hours. How many hours should he have dedicated to that assignment?\nOutput: 4.5 hours * 20 hours * 20 = 120 hours * 3,150 = 36,000\nIf the accounting hours each week are 20 + 3,150 = 45 + 4,400 = 60 + 5,700 = 72 hours.\nIf the salary is $1,000 per week, $96 per day for five hours is $144, and the four hours working on the assignment are $6.48 plus $3.08 per day for 24 days = $84.38. So, the answer is 18\n\nInput:You are making cookies and want to add chocolate chips to them. Which cookie mix would you choose for chocolate chips?\nOutput:You would pick this one.\nInput: You have a new order for cookies and you have chosen one of your favorites. You plan to take 1 box to the supermarket and leave 2 boxes for your staff. You can make about 500 cookies. You have one box that is not labeled. Would you choose that one?\nOutput:If you made 500 cookies at work and 500 boxes for the staff, the total cost of the cookies would be 1252*500 = 151380\nThat is 16 cookies for the staff. If you take 200 boxes to the supermarket and leave 1,000, you still have 1,000 for the staff. If, when you take your cookies to the supermarket, they come out the wrong color, no one would be the wiser. You would still have 1348 for the staff. That means, the total cost after the cost of the cookies would still be the same, 1612 * 1292 = 91320.\nThat means you would take 1087 boxes to the supermarket and keep 100 for you and your staff, leaving 748 remaining for your suppliers, leaving you an unsold box for your staff. So the total cost", "answer": "C: office"}

{"text": "Viruses mainly damage cells.\nViruses mainly attack cells, and they do so in two distinct ways: by infecting them, and by reproducing them.\nInfecting is what viruses usually do: they infect a cell and they give the cell energy to multiply, which it will then use to reproduce.\nReproducing is what viruses usually do, too, but not often. Viruses usually either multiply inside cells, or in bacteria, or in fungi, or in parasites. Viruses usually multiply and reproduce once they've infected a cell.\nRecreating can be used to infect other cells. A virus could infect a cell and make it reproduce cells, but it might also copy other cells that make the virus and put them in the host cell. Viruses can also infect bacterial cells. For example, HIV has already spread to humans through homosexual sex, but it started by infecting bacteria and replicating in the host cells. HIV is very efficient at replicating in the bacterial cells of its hosts, and this makes HIV almost impossible to defeat.\nOnce a virus has been inside a cell, it has no place to go but up. Cells are the greatest hosts available to viruses (since they are made up almost entirely of matter) so it could be said that viruses would choose their hosts very wisely. But in reality, viruses rarely choose the hosts that they infect as much as they infect the organisms that they infect.\nIf a virus uses cells to reproduce, infecting them is called replicating. If a virus uses cells to replicate in host cells, it is called replicating. Viruses also spread across hosts, called spreading. A virus can spread when it infects the human body. Viruses spread across hosts by using the host's genes to make copies of itself.\nViruses usually reproduce in bacteria and are very efficient at spreading themselves, which is why viruses are so efficient at propagating themselves among hosts.\nViruses typically multiply and reproduce in their hosts just as rapidly as they spread themselves, and for the most part they replicate themselves as quickly as they can inside these hosts.\nVirals are not good in small groups. Virals must spread their genes. When a virus spreads, it must reproduce. The more it replicates (spreads), the more rapidly it replicates. If a virus replicates quickly enough in its host, it becomes infectious: the genes that the viruses uses to make copies of themselves will be expressed in the host's cells.\nV", "answer": "A: infect"}

If one person starts with X, the other person starts with Y, the other person starts Y and the third person starts Z, the person starting Z will have an age of 20 plus the age of one other person.

The circus often takes the monkeys to the zoo where they can show them off and sell them. The monkeys are also taken to a zoo to show off, but it seems that they only show off monkey power, so they often only perform tricks and not really trick people.

{"text": "If we decide to stay in my home county of Virginia, and I take my heifer to the New Hampshire farm I chose (a dairy farm), she would have a very good chance at finding that farm.\nOutput: 7 = 4 = <<7*2=15>>15 hours\nThe first 5 points are the amount of time I'd have to spend looking for a dairy farm. The next 5 points are the amount that would make it worthwhile. So for example if I got 7 hours of work in, every five hours were worth 7 hours. Since 6 hours were spent looking at cows, every minute of those would be worth 1 minute. So if I spent 7 hours looking at cows, every five hours were also worth 7 hours. Each of the 5 hours spent looking at cows, were worth 3 hours of looking at something interesting. So the total value of the 7 hours was worth 8 hours.\nIn this situation, the cow we chose (The dairy farm in NH) would take 15 hours to look for, instead of 7.\nSo with all the extra time that we would have if we decided to stay in my home state, we did have an opportunity to find the dairy farm in NH.\nWhich is the correct answer?\n\nInput:An old man sits in the cafe at the park where his grandson has been waiting.

But they are likely to find pleasure in the companionship with other people, the sharing, the conversation, the music, and the food, which all add to their good life.\nIn other words when someone is outgoing, they seek fun, they seek experiences and they are happy to have someone to share that with.\nIf they are outgoing, then they will seek money and possessions. But they seek them in a different way. They need them on occasions, but they need fun, as well.\nThe last point, however, is very interesting. It suggests that if people are outgoing that they are probably not trying to find some good goal, that is, they do not have a strong desire to find inner peace and happiness, because that will take care of themselves. They don't have the energy for that; they have too much on their plate.\nOn the other hand if they are outgoing, then it is likely that they are seeking a greater life purpose. They are looking for the perfect person by whom they can share their experiences and goals. Someone better, someone who is not better than them (they will never be good enough). Someone better who can give them the experience, and with whom they can become better. A person who is better than them will be more willing to do and enjoy things with them, to spend more quality time together or to get together more often.

As an audience member, you want to be the loudest. This puts you at the top of the heap! So how to get out there? Well, you can sing (somewhat), dance and dance, and even dance more than you sing. At a show, however, you want to be standing as a group. This usually creates a natural crowd environment. So how do you get your crowd to the front? If you sing, stand up and shout (or wave your hand).

She plans to study at Brown, and take the SAT Subject Tests. At Brown, she and her friends are the #1 ranked student body, and receive exceptional scholarships. However, she wishes to take Advanced Placement courses in her remaining two years of high school, and hopes to gain admission into a competitive Ivy League college. She knows that taking AP courses is harder than her average high school work, and she would really like to take calculus classes in her senior year of high school. A calculus teacher will pay her $5,000 as a stipend to tutor her in calculus. Alice's family has only $5,000, and they need it badly because Alice has to quit her job to tutoring her friends. How much money does Alice need to tutor?\nInput:Alice will have to charge $5,000 to tutor a single student. $5,000 x 200 students, divided by 200 is $1000. Divide $1000 x 13 students, dividing each student's score by 100 is 13*100 = 200.\nInput:Calculus classes are taught in a different block than math classes. The student's highest score for the Advanced Placement exams is in a different class than the student's scoring on the subject tests, and the lowest score on the subject tests is in the same block as the highest score. For example, the student with a score of 13.25 on his subject tests scored 49, with a score of 21 on the AP exams, both in the Advanced Placement Biology class. Because Alice also teaches AP Biology at the same high school, we can take these 2 subjects into account.\nInput:Alice's stipend will be $5000 each semester. $500 x 200 will be $1350.\nInput:The total amount that Alice will need to hire a tutor to teach Advanced Placement calculus to 200 students is $14,000 per semester.\nOutput:2 x 13 x 200 = $14,000\nAlice will need to hire a teacher to teach calculus to 50 students.

{"text": "very plain\n\nInput: The man in the painting has a strong background, but his face is so small, how can we tell it is him?\nOutput: Since all of the painting is centered around the man's waist, we see the background of the man when his head and shoulders are pulled back to look up. At the bottom of the painting, the artist has blurred out the faces of his 2 closest neighbours. This will block their faces and make it harder to see who they are.\nOutput: The man standing has a strong background, his face is too far towards the left. His face is at the bottom, his eyes are blocked to the left and his nose is close to the mouth, making the nose look very wide and his mouth look very small.\nOutput: The face of the man at right is blurred out so you can't really see anything, so we can't tell it's from the painting at right and therefore it does not belong to that person.\nOutput: The whole picture is blurred, the man's face is so small that you can only see his ear. What is it the man's ear is doing at the bottom of the canvas?\nOutput: The face is blurred all around, his nose is small and his mouth is very small.\n\nInput: If we rotate the image left or right, what happens to the line?

For the last letter the position has to be adjusted, so it will look strange again, which may result in even more strange positions.\nOutput * (left * right * depth) - A: 45 * 1.3 = 1590.\nOutput * (right * depth) - B: 45 * 1.33 = 1569.\nOutput * depth * 3 = 1602.\n\nInput: The questioner didn't know the artist.

{"text": "Put it back on the shelf behind the onions that are close to wilting\nI had three choices, C, D, E.\nC is too obvious  because C was on the refrigerator and therefore the obvious choice, so I just said E. E is the only answer I didn't see before I asked, so I put it in the place E said it wasn't.\nD is a problem since it also implies that Lawrence's family has to move the shelf away from the onions so that they will last longer because they are spoiling. I would prefer to just say D so people can think of E, or E (my last choice), but D is not considered an example. I put it in the freezer rather than the refrigerator, because of the refrigerator problem. The freezer is not the right place for cabbage in this situation.\nAfter a while of looking at each choice, I gave up on choosing a way to answer and just wrote what I chose with how much I spent on groceries. The number of groceries I spent was a little too big of a number to count. To see the totals, I used the total of all groceries I bought, rounded down. The total of how many groceries I bought was 14 dollars.\nSo the final product is as follows: 14 + 14 + 14 = 31 dollars\nThat is how much Lawrence spent shopping. He put 34 dollars worth of groceries in the fridge and freezer. The total groceries was $31 dollars. Since there were 17 dollars left over, the value of 34 dollars was added to that which Lawrence bought to get his total. The total came to $31 dollars.\nIt took about 45 minutes of thinking to decide on what to do. After about 30 minutes, I decided to make an extra effort to get a few more groceries before the next paycheck, and then just use it when the paycheck came in. I added 34 dollars to my grocery budget and was able to spare almost 6 dollars without spending any more money on groceries. The extra grocery money really added up.\nOne thing I forgot to do when I was adding the last 5 dollars to my grocery budget was to buy a new car. I had decided, when I decided to grocery budget, that the money I was spending on groceries was not enough, so I would replace my car with a new car within the next four months. So, I thought about it for quite a while and decided to go with E, since Lawrence said that was the most obvious and least expensive answer.\nNow that I am done", "answer": "C: freezer"}

{"text": "The stale smell must be near the toilet. The bathroom contains 5.5 liters of tap water, the kitchen has 5.6 liters and the cupboard contains 5.7 liters. The surface of the earth is a good place for a bathroom to smell. Therefore, all the other items mentioned above are good sources of stale smells. The surface of the ground can never have a stale smell.\nInput: The smell coming from the bathroom is coming from the toilet. Choice:  A Note: In a toilet, urine comes out of the bottom of the bowl, which is near the bottom of the toilet cistern. Therefore, if you were to open the cistern, urine would immediately spray out rather than wait for rain or snow to cool before spraying out. Therefore, the only real way to check the toilet, is to make sure that there is no urine.\nOutput: Since the drain is located right below the toilet, urine must be spraying out of the bowl. Therefore, the toilet isn't a good source.\nInput: The bathroom must include a bathtub. Choice:  A\nOutput: A bathtub will not hold enough water to carry away urine. Therefore, urine will immediately spray out on contact. Therefore, the only reasonable place for a bathroom to make a urine spray is by going to the washroom. Bathrooms have no other alternative.\nInput: A cat is in the bathroom. Choice:  A note: This scenario assumes that the bathroom is enclosed and has a wall between the bathroom and the hall. Therefore, it is necessary to seal the toilet cistern after the cat is removed. If any urine spills onto the floor and there is no wall in the bathroom, urine will immediately run down the hall (it will flow downhill) and onto the carpet. Therefore, the toilet is no good.\nOutput: A cat is not a suitable source if urine is to be dried quickly. It is not a good idea to leave the cat in the bathroom, where urine can collect. Therefore, the only alternative is to go outside the bathroom and walk outside (away from the wall and toilet). Then, urine can run along the carpet (downhill) to the kitchen. Therefore, the wall is not a good place for a cat to have a piss.\nInput: The toilet has a leaking water pipe.

He interviews 4 people for the position, 2 of them are the candidates. When he sends them the job posting, he takes the names so he knows whom he might not hire. He gives his recommendation to the person who's name he chose first. If John were offered any of the other three jobs, he would still hire them both, but he wouldn't recommend them to the candidate who's name he chose second. He's willing to give the job to one of them. Why?\nOutput: John's firm prefers two candidates he doesn't hire. He'd prefer for the one who's name he chooses first to be the candidate for the job, but he's willing to try another candidate because there's a possibility that he will make a mistake, and the candidate who's name is first isn't guaranteed the job. So in this situation one candidate may not get the job, and the other may. In fact, John thinks he'd prefer that the second candidate be hired for the job if, in fact, he knows he has a chance. So based on the information John got in the job posting, he would hire both of them and recommend them to the candidate he chose first in the first place. So the final answer is his firm prefers two candidates he won't hire. And he'll recommend them to the candidate with his first choice.\n\nInput:A is interested in the color red when wearing shoes.

{"text": "Let m = the total beverage volume in a litre bottle. At 5 millilitres, let v = 1 litre in a litre. For 5 litre bottles, give a unit: ml. Now multiply v by 4 to give: m / 0.125 = v / 0.625 = 10 litres. Divide by 2 to get: 0.125 litres.\nLet v = 10 litre of beer. At 0.125 ml per litre, 1 litre in a bottle = 5 ml. Therefore the total volume of beer in a bottle is 20 ml. With v being one litre, 20 ml in a bottle = 20 ml / 2 = 16 ml in a litre. At 0 ml / 2, 1 mL / 2 = 16 ml / 2.\nTherefore the total bottle volume of beer in a litre is 16 ml.\nSince beer = 1 ml / 2, 16 mL / 2 = 4 mL in a litre.\nSince beer = 2 ml / 2, 20 mL / 2 = 4.2 mL in a litre, 16 ml / 2 / 2 = 16.22 mL in a litre\nThat means that the total volume of beer = 60 ml in a litre\nThe final answer is 60 ml in a litere\n\nInput:I have 2 pieces of information: a phone and a book.

If one of their boyfriends asks them about the other guy that they liked, will they tell each other the original facts? The results will vary. Some women will just give an answer like A or B. When asked if their boyfriend likes other girls, many will give a yes or no answer. If your students are asked the question, \"Do you like boys or girls?\", they will choose either boys or girls.\nThe student that told you that she likes boys will probably respond with \"Most boys like me. I don't like guys.\" The student that is asked to make up a boy or a girl will probably say \"Oh! Yes, he (boy) likes me!\" or \"Yes, he (boy) never did anything wrong to me.\" (Your students might also choose which one to tell you.)\nYour students will find this surprising. The reason should be that the girls are choosing boys.

In addition, the cows cost $2.   So Simon has a profit of 35 * 5*2 = 175$.  How much money is Simon using as an example?\nOutput: Simon is using an Example as an example. So his example is 175*5*2 + $0.05 * 2 = 175$, which is 25 cents each per day (25% of each day).\nThe retail price for a cow is $6, but the farmer selling the cow is only giving him the cow for $3.50. Therefore, Simon is making $3.50 * 3 = $13.50 after taxes.\nAt 25 cents per day, the farmer only owes Simon $5.   Simon could earn $1.50 per day ($25/year) if he can only milk one cow all day, but this would require 6 cows (12.5% of the dairy cow's daily production); the farmers who only plan on milking one cow will not be able to afford that many cows; therefore, it is not a viable method of making money with a cow.\nThe farmer selling the cow now owes Simon $5, whereas Simon now owes the farmer $3.50.    Simon is taking only $5.2 per day in profit, but now the farmer owes him $11.50.\nThus, Simon's example of 175 * 5*2 * $0.05 = 175$ in profit is a profitable method.\nThus, Simon did very well with his example.", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

{"text": "The first sentence is incorrect. In A everyone already has beer.  In B and C he would have to sneak into the neighbor's house.  I don't know where D would cause problems.\nI don't like that this assumes that the spouse is \"on probation\". The laws surrounding a criminal on probation are different from those that apply to an alcoholic.  If someone's on probation drinking to his/her own detriment, and hurting people, they don't have to answer for it.\nThis also assumes that the neighbor's house has beer. Not all neighborhoods in America have neighborhoods or that have a house with beer. In some neighborhoods people buy beer off the street. Those are also very different from the neighborhood where Jimmy is looking for a beer. If one of those neighborhoods doesn't have beer, Jimmy doesn't get to choose it. If he wanted to get drunk, he should stop at the nearest town's gas station and ask for help.\nThe next time this happened, he should just ask to go to the closest gas station. That would ensure that no one can take advantage of him.\nThe homeless shelter wouldn't work because liquor stores have a different licensing requirement.\nI don't think he'd be able to find the bridge. His next best choice would be to go home, have a beer, and then work out the next day.\nThanks for the explanation of how he would call his wife. I didn't think about that.  Now I know why it didn't click the first time. The neighbor's house may or may not have beer available; he could have asked his wife's family friends if they had any beer in the house, perhaps.  It never occurred to me to ask about drinking at the shelter.\nI realize that the only reason that he wasn't able to get back to the bridge was because his stepmother wouldn't let him into his wife's car (as he's obviously not an alcoholic). That also explains why he didn't choose the bridge; there must be a bridge in the area. Maybe not the same one, but there must be a bridge.\n\n Thanks you for the explanation; without it, I might have chosen the wrong option.\n\nInput: This is a short text box.

He was hired at McDonalds. There are two managers who work at the same time - at the drive thru. The manager of the drive thru is also the manager of the restaurant. When one of the managers is not available because they have to run an errand, the other manager leaves their job, leaving their partner in charge to do the tasks that would normally be done by the other. If someone else were to do those tasks, the partner would get a monetary compensation. In his second job, Mr. Michael is doing inventory control at a restaurant. When inventory is low, he takes home the cost of the food and is paid by the restaurant for it. He also has to put the cost of any food items he sells to him in his own expense account. In his other job, he is selling tickets to theater performances. When tickets are sold to customers, he goes to them and gives them a ticket and charges them the price of the tickets, while they pay the ticket themselves, and reimburse the theater once they get their tickets. The two jobs have the same title, Manager of the Drive Thru and Manager of the Restaurant. During the lunch hour on Fridays, Michael is the only one at the drive thru. During the weekends, he is the only one doing inventory control and also at the restaurant. If someone else were doing those tasks, Mr. Michael would get a monetary compensation and a bonus for each person who did those tasks with him. If this were a job that required only a person to do the tasks with him, however, there would be a monetary compensation for each person, but it would be lower than for the tasks themselves. If someone else were done doing those tasks, though, Michael would still get a monetary compensation, but it would only be in the form of money that would be returned to him as check in the future\nIf someone else were doing those jobs with Michael, then a monetary compensation would be given in the form of a deduction\n\nInput:Jack, a college senior, has 3 days in April in which he wants to spend at least 15 minutes playing video games every day, starting a minute before his birthday.

You and I can do this in two rooms and when someone is doing their work, we will say \"Yes, I understand that your work costs more then my work.\" So, you in my room and I in your room would both have costs. But why do one has to pay more then the other, since there is no room to work in the \"Work Room\" and we are in the \"Other Room\"? The \"Work Room\" has to have room to work, or we all would not be in there, since we are all either writing or speaking or both. The \"Other Room\" does not have to have a working place, but it has to have a room to take care of our own personal \"Work\" problems. So, we can call the \"Work Room\" \"Work\" and the \"Other Room\" \"Other\"\nBut since we are in two different rooms, then how come one person always has more money then the other? Since they are doing their \"Other\" work, and I am doing my \"Work\" work, the answer is because \"My\" work is more then \"Your\" work, since they are in two different rooms and I am in the room that has no \"Other Room\" and they are in the room that we can both still do our \"Other\" work.\nHere are the steps of how the \"Work Room\" or \"Work\" works:\nThe \"Work Room\" has the people in the \"Work Room\".\nThe \"Work Room\", and the \"Other Room\", and the \"Work Area\" have the different \"Work Areas\".\nSince we both have to stay in the \"Other Room\" for the time we are working, we each share a \"Work Area\".\nHere are the times that we do our \"Work\".\n\nInput:When a house becomes very overcrowded, it's residents can't possibly function.

Y family is 2.5 times as expensive as the family of 4. How does X family spend $20, Y family $60 and Y family $160?\nOutput:\nX family is $20 * (2.5* $160) * (2.75* $80) = $120 * 2.5 * (4 x 4) = $240\nY family is $60 * 2.5 * $160 * $2.75 * (4 x 4 x 4) = $200\nY family is $160 * 2.5 * 3 * $160 * $4, $80 = $320.\nSo family is $320 * 2.5 = $920\nBut the total family was $960\nSo family of 4 paid $520\n\nInput: The doctor was going to run a test to examine a tooth.

He has received many letters from students throughout history expressing interest in history. He was not sure which history he would teach today. He decided on Civil War History.\nOutput: Today's History: Civil War\nThis is an excerpt from a series of emails, which Bill sends to his students to help them learn about the Civil War.\nFirst, he writes:\nDear students,\nThis is one of the most difficult parts of teaching history--to try to explain how this is so important to the past and how we still know so little. I do not do one lesson on Civil War. Not one. I teach about 100 students each class, sometimes, and their history of the Civil War covers every era, from prehistory to twentieth century.\nSo, what's a teacher to do?\nBill first describes a great way this can be done.\n\"I think one of the best ways to teach the Civil War to the students is to show examples so they can begin to picture what it was like to live through that time. For example, if you are teaching about the early South, maybe the old soldiers or the slave owners will have stories about the things around them. I've learned the best way to get students to understand something they've never seen is to make it more visual. I try to make my slides with pictures of those things. Showing pictures of those objects, that gives them something tangible that is close enough in time to what someone might see in a history lesson. It is also a good way to show the student how different eras were", "answer": "C: musical"}

{"text": "Go to your friend's house\n\nInput: The President has an annual deficit of about 70 billion dollars. The deficit has been getting worse, because the government has given away free stuff to the \"little people\" (farmers, fishermen...) for years. The government has also been giving money to the pharmaceutical companies, because pharmaceuticals cost 70 billion dollars each year. The President wants a reduction in the deficit. What can he do?\nAnswer : 1. Reduce the military A. The military budget consists of 10.4 billion dollars. It costs 1.35 billion dollars to produce the equipment for it. 2. Reduce the expenses of taxes. A. 10 billion dollars is just a portion of the taxes that businesses collect. For example, for a given tax return, the government will collect 15 billion to 1.30 billion dollars from payroll taxes. The government doesn't receive that much from VAT. The taxes that are collected on tobacco products don't count either. It's just about 20 billion dollars. B. The military budget is currently funded with taxes paid through payroll tax, but since we've seen decreases in the income tax, taxes from corporate taxes, and the VAT, we should have a surplus of 1 billion dollars per year. C. We should increase the gas tax. A. There are a number of other reasons why we shouldn't have a gas tax (like it would cost more per gallon, etc.), but the government should look at taxes that help the poorest people in order to reduce the number of people who are living below the poverty line. B. The gas tax, which is the most popular in several states, could generate a small surplus without affecting car owners.\nD. We could continue to give food stamps out, even though about half of them are used for food rather than other uses. A. The food stamp distribution system is underfunded because many states, like New York, believe that because people are poor, they don't need to be helped. B. Food stamps help the poor by providing them with food, but it costs the government 15 billion dollars each year. C. Giving food stamps out will not solve the problem. The government has put into place programs designed to provide food for people who don't need food stamps. E. If the government stopped giving free food stamps, they would be able to reduce the deficit, because fewer people would need it, and businesses would feel less pressure to provide food for those who are poor.\n\nInput:\n\"The biggest thing I learned since the election", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}

When Corey came back online, he said that he thought he was going to die. How did the man defend himself?\nOutput: Corey tells Tapanga he was scared.\nTapanga tells Corey he got a punch in return.\nCorey tells Tapanga that he doesn't want to defend himself and has a gun in his pocket. Tapanga agrees that he doesn't want Corey to have the gun.\n\nSuggested Answer:\n\nTapanga says that Corey is very nice and he hopes he doesn't mind, but Corey has to go to work. Tapanga says that he won't be leaving his side until they get home. How will they get to work when they get home?\n\nAnswer: Tapanga will catch a Metro bus. Corey will catch the Red Line metro bus. The total bus fare from home to work is 4 dollars.\n\nSuggested Answering Explanation:\n\nCorey and Tapanga can walk but are very weak. They can walk together but are not strong enough to walk in a group. Therefore Corey tries to protect Tapanga in the first place by keeping a gun in his pocket (since he is afraid he won't help him).\n\nTapanga needs a ride. Therefore she can't walk back.

{"text": "No\nYou can't make all of the appointments. It doesn't matter.\n\nWhat happens when the grooming takes longer than you expected?\n\nThere are more important cases you need to take care of. The groomer told you this is the best appointment of the week. She probably has a legitimate excuse. She may have cut the hair longer than you expect, or she's a dirty stylist. She may have left the towels, brushes and soaps on the floor. It's the kind of appointment you only get if you have a ton of grooming clients. The groomer's assistant said the haircut is probably a good idea. This appointment is not an urgent appointment.\n\nIt depends on what else you have on the calendar. This appointment can wait until tomorrow or when you have more space. It might be worth leaving the appointment until next week if you feel the client will understand.\nHere's a common example of a grooming appointment that isn't so urgent. There is a man who has had a shave every morning since high school, and he wants to feel pretty for Valentine's Day. He takes a shower, and he takes a shower every evening. In his experience, it's important to groom on a schedule every night.\nA grooming appointment is really more like a grooming lesson. It might take an hour to an hour and a half, and it depends on how many grooming clients there are. This grooming lesson could involve some grooming tips. They can probably do this without too much of a trouble. It might also take 1.5 hours to complete the task.\nThe grooming lesson usually costs another five to ten dollars.\nIt's not a big deal to have a grooming lesson on the schedule for when it's needed. The salon can afford to do it for a few people who have very short grooming schedules. They may use the grooming lesson instead of another appointment. A grooming lesson is worth its cost. The salon can set up some grooming lessons on the schedule. When you walk in, you will have a groom to teach you the grooming rules. They will give instructions, and you can use their grooming tools to help you complete the grooming lesson. You may want to set an appointment for the same time for the following day.\nIf you cancel the appointment scheduled on the same day, the price of the grooming lesson is not refunded.\nIt depends on other scheduled appointments. It may not be an urgent matter, but it can wait until tomorrow or next week.\nIf you can't find any", "answer": "C: late"}

{"text": "A-B-D-E. For example: You get a-b-c-e...\nInput: A is for a verb. Example: \"How long is a piece of string?\" A: \"How long is one side of a pencil?\"\nOutput: B-C-D-E. The answer depends on what you want to express. If the answer is two sentences - A - B - C - E, then you can use all three.\nOutput: As we have seen, three prepositions combine to get different choices than when you use only one. So now we can see the difference. For example: (2) A-B-C-E.\nOutput: (2) A - B - C-E. When 1) A. B is the only word used and the word C must have a preposition, (2) A -B - C-E is the response (e.g. (2) A C E).\nOutput: (2)(1) A C E is always used.\nAnd (2) C, is the correct way of expressing the same idea using only one preposition A. B, A and C are all correct prepositions.\nOutput: 2) A - B -C-E is the wrong way of saying what the student wrote.\n\nInput: What are the first 8 letters of the alphabet?\nOutput: U, A, G, W, O, X, Y, Z\nInput: What is the name of the President of Ukraine?\nOutput: Vitaly Guberna\nInput: What is a word that means \"I'm not so good at math\"?\nOutput: K-M-A-R-O\nInput: Which of these is the first letter of the Greek alphabet?\nOutput: I - P - R\nInput: What are two words that end with two different letters?\nOutput: Z-U-B\nInput: What is one word that sounds like \"woo\"?\nOutput: A-P-T-S\nInput: What is an extra letter in the Greek alphabet?\n Output: T - U\nInput: What is 5 letters of the English language (no spaces)?\nOutput: 5\nInput: What three words start with 3 different letters?\nOutputs: D - R - M - N\nInput: What does the U symbol stand for?\nOutput: We use the U for the Latin alphabet, and", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

{"text": "Under a toilet\nWhich is the safest storage place?\nOutput: Under a cabinet\nWhich kind of drugs are the most likely to be misused? Alcohol, amphetamines, tranquilizers, and benzodiazepines\nWhy do they misuse these drugs?\nInput: Drugs used as a recreational substance are used very widely, as many people have heard of some drugs from friends, or have done these illegal drugs before but think they've seen them on drugs. They're usually used recreationally, such as LSD and mushrooms, but others can be used as a tool of oppression, such as drugs to control women or control the minds of the mentally ill. For instance, antidepressants can help people who are depressed but also have suicidal thoughts.\nInput: Drugs used for a clinical use are usually prescribed very carefully and carefully followed. A popular example is antidepressants or pain or anxiety painkillers, where the side effects can be very severe and can affect moods. A small amount of these could be dangerous if the dosage was a problem (especially in the early stages of pregnancy where the woman would take these with sex or when sexually active with other men) but the drugs are in controlled clinical trials and are very rarely misused. However, recreational drugs like hallucinogens and MDMA have been misused as a dangerous tool, usually used for socialization.\nOutput: Alcohol, amphetamines and benzos are more likely to be misused, as they are dangerous drugs and can cause fatal accidents.\nInput: Drugs that can be used to control women or to control mentally ill patients are used by many as tools. In particular, psychiatric drugs like lithium, prozac, etc are used to control and manage these disorders and can cause mental problems that are very difficult to control. Thus, these can be misused as a tool for oppression.\nInput: Alcohol, amphetamin, and benzodiazepined's can cause fatal accidents, as there is a high chance of them being fatal. This is why these drugs are often misused.\nInput: Some people use the drugs to socialize. It's also common among students in colleges and universities, especially college students who have a \"loose\" lifestyle\nOutput: Alcohol, benzos and amphetamin are more likely to be used recreationally than to control emotions, thoughts, feelings or moods.\nInput: They may be used for socialization and they might not be misused as much when misused for socializing, as they don't have any long term or permanent", "answer": "A: medicine cabinet"}

One week after the baby, Jack and Rose had a second baby. This time it was a boy. The baby was 8 weeks old when it was born. How long would the baby be by next Sunday? (Total of 8 weeks)\nOutput:2 weeks * 2 weeks + 6 = 8 weeks* 4 weeks = 7 weeks*4 days * 2 weeks = 7 weeks* 5 weeks = 8 weeks\n7 weeks + 5 weeks = 1 month and 10 days.\nBaby Rose was ready for the outside by May 1st, one month and 10 days ago.\nIf Baby Rose were already outside before May 1st, then the baby would be ready for the outside by March 1st.\nSince Baby Rose was born on May 1st, the baby was ready to have the outside 3 weeks ago. (The baby is 6 weeks old on Sunday)\nThus, the answer is 3 weeks. The question is:\n\nInput:Jack has three children between ages 12 and 15. His youngest (age 15) is sick of school and only works 1 hour after school ends. How long will it take Jack to send his oldest(age 13) to school?

So Jack would take his 10-year-old son to school in only 8 minutes. (Jack has his 10-year-olds at home, so he could go immediately after giving them dinner)\nThis gives us the following:\n12:10 = 6 minutes * 10 = 9 minutes 0:10 = 1 minute\n10:10 = 6 minutes + 1 = 8 minutes\nTherefore, the final answer is 8\n\nInput:Santino was hired as a dish boy at a restaurant.

It's obvious that the mall advertised heavily on Wednesday when the store opened. But the store didn't advertise that it was a better deal than the cinema hall. Only half of Americans who went shopping on New Year's Eve bought a brand new suit. The fact that there was a difference in prices between the two shows that malls can improve their price comparison advertisement. Advertising should also show the savings to the customer over just the suit.

The total food charge was $0.0040 an item. The total salary was the total amount the restaurant had.\nOutput: 2.15 * 10 = 0.0108\nSubtracting 0.0108 from both sides of the equation, the final answer is 0.0040\nThe employee is paid $2,500 * $10 = 2500\nThe employee is paid\n$1,500 * 2.15 * 40 = 2000\nSubtracting 2500 from both sides of the expression, it comes out as $20.00\nThe employer paid $25,500 for his employee. The employer paid $25,100 for the employee's services.\nThe employer paid $2,500 per hour to his employee. The rate to be paid for the employee services is $75 an hour. Total income for the employer in 1997 was $150,000. Total salaries paid to the employer were $150,000.\nSince each dollar provides 50 cents extra, employee salaries cost 100 times less than the food costs. Since the total sales of the restaurant was $250,000, the total payroll is $15,500\nSo, employee salaries cost $3.25 times less than the total food costs.\nSo, the total annual salary of the employee was $30,000\nSo, the amount of income earned by the employee was $65,000\nSo the total annual income of the employee was $100,000\nSubtracting the total income from the total income for 1997, $65,000 comes out as", "answer": "B: mall"}

{"text": "D is correct\nAn advantaged player could reach advantage position through three possible methods. An advantaged player gains an advantage by getting 2 (or more) candies and then either taking two or one candy to put it into a bag. An advantaged player also gains an advantage by getting 5 candies and using the 5 candies to pick up another and then taking the other candy that he picked up earlier to put it in another bag with the first one. And an advantaged player can gain an advantage either by getting 2 candies and putting one into a bag or 2 candies and picking up another and then putting the two candies into a bag (also 1 or 2 candies). Thus, all three methods of gaining advantage depend on the number of candies he has. A advantaged player who has four candies can reach an advantage if he picks the five candies, reaches two candies by picking a third candy or reaches two candies by getting the fifth one and uses the five candies to pick up a fourth one. The advantaged player only needs 4 candies and 4 candies to get 10 candies.

The sum total of this number is displayed. Input: Sum total of 7 plus 5 = 7\nOutput: Total 7 + 5 = 7/5\nSum 7 * 5 + 5 = 35\nSo add 35 to 3 / 7 and take 3 / 35 to get 9 / 35. This gets the total of 7 minus 5 divided by 7. This gets the total 3 minus 5. Now add 25 to 3 / 35 and take 25 / 35 to get 25 minus 5. This gets the total 7 minus 5 plus 35 minus 7 minus 5 minus 10 * 21 = 7\nAdd 21 / 35 to 3/7 and take 3/7 / 35 to get 9/35. This gets 9/35 plus 35 or 42.

What information do you think I should look for?\n\ninput : What is the best way to solve an equation?\noutput : What would be the best way for you to solve the equation? and what would be the worst?\n\nIn this case, I used an equation to find all of the answers. The best way is the one that produces the least confusion, because you are searching for the right answer. The worst way is the one that requires the least input and best output.\n\nThe best way is to use the simplest approach and go through the process until you find the right equation. You know where all of the variables would be based on the equation and the answers (I assume that most people would use a calculator). Then, by checking the variables and finding the best answer, you get the right answer.\n\nThe worst way is to just guess. Even if you know that the answer is going to be correct, you may not know how you got there and you may make mistakes.\n\nThe best (and worst) solution has some degree of guesswork. The right solution may be more complex than the right solution from the wrong solution, but may eventually lead to the right answer if the right answer is found.\n\nIn my example, the first approach is going to get you to the right answer. If you know the answer, then you can use only the information provided (if it is a question like \"beavers build to block a river\" then the beavers build a river dam). Therefore, if you know the answer, you can use only that answer. The problem then becomes determining the right answer, where the answer is not based on the equation.\n\nThe second approach is the one to avoid, because it requires more steps and uses more inputs and outputs, resulting in more confusion and possible mistakes.\n\nThe worst approach is going to the wrong answer. You have no idea about the question. You may guess some answer and get it right for that particular question, but that is about it, because you have no idea where the answer came from.\n\nThe best solution to problem 1 would be the best solution to problem 2. The second approach would be better because it does not require you to guess. However, if you know the right answer to problem 2, then the first approach will still get you to the right solution.

(A,B): \u019aB = 2\u019aB + 2\u019aC + 2\u019aD\nOutput: B + C + D = 4.85 + C + D = 7.06\n6.6 + D = 7.27\nSolution: For a number $n$, a is the number of possible values \u019a$ and $n=1, 2, 3, 4,...,... = 8. We know that $n$ is prime, so we can solve for $n$ right away.\nAs $e$ is any number less than $n$, there is a chance that $e>n$ or $e<n$. As $n$ is prime and $e$ is prime, then at least one of the next 8 integers is not $e$. If $e<n$, then $e>n$ because the next 8 integers are $e$. This means that $e$ is prime and $n$ is not prime and thus $e>n$. Thus $e>n$ and there is an $e>n$ number at least $e>5$. If $e>n$ is less than $e$ and $3 < $n$, then $e$. If $3<n$, then $3<n$. If $e>3$ is less than $n$, $e$ is less than $c+1.$ If $c+1>n$, then $c+1>5$.\nThere are 2 ways to get $e$ less than $n$ and only one way to get $c+1<n$ and only one other way to get $e>3$. When $c+1>6$, that is $6<5$, so $n$ and $n+1$ are prime.\nNote that for a number $n$, there are no $e>n$ solutions with $1$ less than $n$. If this is the case, then $n$ is not divisible by $1$ and $e$ is divisible by $2.\nWhen $e>2$ and $c+1 < 6$, let $e=2$ and let $1 = 6. Notice that in all those circumstances there is a $e>n$ solution, thus $c+1<6", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

The average number of secular parties have increased from 40 for the first half of 1946 to 110 in 1967 (Figure 5). The average secular party has been falling steadily since then, and it is now only around 30. It is expected that secular parties will continue to fall in this direction.\nIt is generally accepted that secular parties are held more often when it is the beginning of a cycle. Thus, a secular party is held in the first 3 years of every cycle, and in the last 3 years it is held on a regular basis, so that the trend line of secular parties will not change even if the rate of secular party increases decreases.\n\nInput: How often are \"real-world\" parties held?

Since many people are going to die during this period, the overall population growth can be considered to be positive. However, if the global population declines, then it is predicted that the number of foreign aid recipients will decrease.\nIf the overall population declines, then America will have to spend less on foreign aid.\nSince the number of foreign aid receipts is decreasing, then American spending will become less.

How many candies will Corey's dad have if he takes away the candies the 2 of them have together? How many candies does Tapanga have if he takes away his other 6 candies?\nOutput: Let y = the total candy Corey has. y + 70 = the total candy Tapanga has.\nLet x = the total number the candy Corey has. For the two of them, let x + (x + 70) = 80.\nCombining like terms and subtracting, we get 2x x + 70 = 80\nSubtracting both sides, we get x = 58\nDividting both sides by 2, y = <<29=29.8>>29, so Corey only has 29 candies. So the final answer is 29+290=580\nThat is the total amount Tapanga has.\nNow let each of them take their candies. The y of a and c is the sum of the other 2 candies. So the total amount lost is the sum of the 6 candies. That leaves about 5 candies for each of them.\nThat leaves 80 for Corey to lose and tapanga to take back.\nSo the final answers totals 580 + 590 = 580 + 580 = 580\nThen add together 580 + 580 and 580 + 580 and 580 = 580.\n\nInput:You are studying to become a paramedic.

The billier does not pay for the bill. How is that possible?\nOutput: If the billier buys nothing from the house, that means that the bar is running on money.  That means that the bank is in business.  There is no bank failure.\nTo show that there is \"money,\" you would also think that the billier is spending (using credit card or bank loan).  The billier is buying something from outside the casino.  If you use money, the billier spends money.  If you use credit, the billier borrows money.  This does not prove that there is money.  There is no money!  That would imply that there is a bank.  There is not a bank.  What is going on?  The casino is not going to allow the billier to go outside, nor will the casino loan money to the billier.  So the casino is bankrupt!  Not a problem!  What happens when the billier is unable to continue running the casino?  Does the money from the casino fund the billier as a new owner?\nOutput: We have a situation in which the billier is taking advantage of the casino and the casino taking advantage of him.  The casino is taking advantage of the billier, and the casino is using money to finance operations and build more casinos.  This happens in a casino.

Then he bought five eggs, two bottles of juice, and one can of soup. He found the store's weekly list on the shelf next to a stack of clean dishes. Then he filled his pail. How many cans of soda did he buy?\nSubtracting the number of cans of soda needed to make a gallon of milk, we find we need 12 cans of soda to make a gallon of dairy.\nAdding the number of cans of juice, we find we need 14 cans of juice to make a gallon of juice.\nSubtracting two gallons of milk from that, we find we need 7.5 gallons of milk. So that means he needed 2.5 gallons of soda and 15.5 bottles of juice.\nTo get these things we have to divide by 8. The amount of time Lawrence would need each day to get 7.5 gallons of dairy is 8 hours. So the final answer is (2.5 * 7.5) = 24.5\n\nInput: The company gave out a raise to all of its employees on Friday. All 711 employees received the raise.

As a result, if one of them was standing in a crosswalk, would they both stand in that spot or not?\n\nOutput: If the boy is standing in a crosswalk with four other people, and he hits a person, would all four get run over? It is obvious that each person would be hit in a straight line, since they would all be standing right next to the person they were going through the intersection when the collision occurred. What if the person they were trying to hit was standing in a crosswalking? The person would have to walk up onto the crosswalk so that they could be hit as opposed to walking towards the intersection and then being hit from behind. Therefore, the person hit would have to walk all the way around, even if they had a full block of space in front of them to avoid the person they were trying be hit by.\n\nInput: A man found a box filled with $50, but he opened it instead of giving the money to the man.

In one scenario, the man could try to hit him with his rifle, which of course, would probably not kill him. In the other scenario, there is no reason to try and hit him with his rifle in the dark hallway, and so instead, the man in the uniform could try to outrun him, because the gunman could not see him as he ran in the open hallway.

He had 60kg (132lbs) while she had 40kg (88lbs). What was the total weight?\nOutput:The runner won because of her heavier body by more than 60 kg (132lbs).\nIn terms of weight, the runner was more than 60kg more than the athlete.\nWeight has a direct relation with the total mass of a person.\nThe athlete weighed more than 40kg (88lbs) less than the runner.\nThe total weight is: 60*40*22 = 132lbs\nTherefore, the total weight of the athlete was: 132/4 = 132lbs.\nSince you have 12kg on one side, the total weight is: 12*16*8 = 132lbs\nNow a more accurate answer. For 12kg, the total weight is 132/5 = 6.25lbs. Now for 40kg, the total weight will be 4.25lbs. Therefore, the total weight will now be 4/50 = 11lbs\nTherefore, the additional 11lbs will be 2/5 = 6.5lbs\nNow 3/100 will give you your final answer.

So, you have to enter into B, but it is quite likely you have to change in some other room.\nAnd if you stay outside E for a long time, you will be very likely a fitness-centred student. So, you will go to D, but you might get a green drink, at least. So, you either have to enter into A or D, so it is a bit unlikely you are heading to E\nOf course, if you are an athlete already, you can head straight for E, but you are unlikely to do that.\nSo if you go straight to E and stay there for a long time, a green drink will probably be one of the main attractions.\n\nInput: A student, S, goes to the library to pick up a book and comes out.

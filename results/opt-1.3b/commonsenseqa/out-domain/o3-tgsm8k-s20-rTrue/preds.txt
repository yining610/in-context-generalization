Therefore, the ball must travel 3 feet past each of the policemen.<n>Output:If they were sitting, the billiards balls must travel 2 foot past each of them.<n>Output:Let x = the total distance of the ball.<n>Output: If the billiards balls are in a cup (ball container) with 1 foot inside the cup, how long would the ball have to travel before hitting the wall?  How far off is the wall?  If it is one foot, the ball will travel 14 inches.<n>Output: Let y = the total distance of three inches in one direction.<n>Output: If they were standing, the billiards ball must travel 6.96 feet past each of them.  How far off is every one of them?<n>Output: Let z = the total distance in one direction.<n>(1)  Let y2 = y1 - 1 = 1.<n>(2) Let x = the total distance in a second direction.<n>Output:Let z = 4 x = 4, so it must travel 9.09 feet in a second (or 2 hours 30 minutes total - 1 hour 20 to travel a distance of 3/4).<n>(3) Let z be the total distance of the billiards shots.<n>Output:Let y = 0.96 x 1 which amounts to the total distance of 2.96 x 3.  So the total distance is 13.06 feet and 1 hour.<n>(4) Let z be the billiards ball's diameter.<n>Output:Let a y be the total distance (0.96 x 3/4

How did you become better? If you knew what to do, how would you help everyone you care about, and how would you know if they are ready to get better?<n>Output:Self-hate is the most likely cause of depression.<n>In my life, there were many people who felt bad about me and they treated me badly because of it. Most of these people, especially in my family, only saw my weaknesses and failures as a curse and never my good things. I always felt like a failure. I always felt like I did not deserve all the attention and favor people showered on me. People in my life, at one point or another, did not treat me like a human being. They treated me like garbage and they acted like their feelings about me mattered.<n>The worst part about my life is that they were my family. They were my friends. They were the people I loved the most at that time. I feel like killing most of them and letting them die as a suicide.<n>I have gotten better at treating myself like a human being. It is important for me to treat myself well. In the meantime, I feel obligated to help family members who are stuck in depression as much as possible.<n>I hope I will be able to treat others well when I grow up as well.<n>My life is always going to be different from what I would have liked, but I like the way it is now, and I do not wish to change it.<n>The hardest part of my life is not so much what I did wrong as it is what the people did not treat me like I was a human being. I have met a lot of amazing people, but I have only been able to meet a handful of really good people. I have gotten lucky so far.<n>I just don't wish to be treated like garbage. I have so many things I would like to buy and do that will not be available if people do not treat me like a person.<n>I hope that I never do kill any of my family members, friends or co-workers, but if I have to, the people that

He has two daughters that each have one sibling. He has 7 people in his family. When the family is in town, he takes all seven people into restaurants. Each person pays $2 per person per meal. Now that six people have been served, how much money does John make each month?<n>Output: John's family members have spent 35,000 dinners in the company of 6 other people and have made 2,800 dinners in the company of just John. Let x = the total cost of the dinners. Then multiply 1/1 by 2.25 to get 2.25 x 1 = 2,836 and multiply it again by the same 2.25 to get 4x 1 = 7,836 meals.<n>Supplying the number 7,836, 2.25 x 4 = 15,000 meals.<n>Supplying 5, 7, 8, 8, 7 or 5 x 5 = 40,000 meals.<n>This total is not that far off, since John pays a total of 40,000 meals per month after deducting the cost of food from the total.<n>After subtracting the cost of the meals from the total, John gets 15,000*40,000 = 15,400 meals per month<n>So John's monthly income is 15,400 = 1,950<n>Add up the expenses for everyone and you get: 7,836 - 15,400 = 1406<n><n>Input:A house is in foreclosure and is being sold for $500,000.

The seller agrees.<n>Output:The seller gets $300,000 on the day the deal falls through. She gets 150,000 on the day she signs.<n>Supplying 17,500 x $350,000 = 50,000<n>Supplying 25,500 x $300,000 = 500,000<n>Supplying 42,500 x $210,000 = 200,000<n>Supplying 120,000 / (10 + 1) = 590,000<n>After determining the total of $550,000, we supply the amount

Of course you would share his happiness, because he would feel good and you would be proud that he chose you, in spite of all your work. How would you describe your happiness, if you share?<n>If a close friend makes happy and amusing cards, you could also enjoy to see those cards. The cards you are seeing are different from the cards your friend makes, so you must find some funny cards. Can you make some funny cards? Of course you can! What makes those cards interesting? That's the point of playing. Sometimes these cards could even cause some of your friends to laugh. However, since those cards are just funny, they are not satisfying! Can you laugh at those cards? Of course you might, but not at every card that your friend makes. What would you enjoy most to share with your son? Happiness is not satisfied when just you, but it is the best kind of happiness if that happiness is shared with your son too! Can you imagine how your son would smile when he learns of the happiness of his friends and of his happiness? As usual he would find a card he likes and play a fun game of cards without being troubled, with the friend's help. What would a friend who thinks about this game with his son say? "How is father with your friends? Do you make them happy? Do you feel joy with them? Of course you do, and you are my true friend."<n><n>Input: The same year, Albert started a new school.

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n>Output:		Viruses mainly damage cells.<n>Viruses mainly attack cells, and they do so in two distinct ways: by infecting them, and by reproducing them.<n>Infecting is what viruses usually do: they infect a cell and they give the cell energy to multiply, which it will then use to reproduce.<n>Reproducing is what viruses usually do, too, but not often. Viruses usually either multiply inside cells, or in bacteria, or in fungi, or in parasites. Viruses usually multiply and reproduce once they've infected a cell.<n>Recreating can be used to infect other cells. A virus could infect a cell and make it reproduce cells, but it might also copy other cells that make the virus and put them in the host cell. Viruses can also infect bacterial cells. For example, HIV has already spread to humans through homosexual sex, but it started by infecting bacteria and replicating in the host cells. HIV is very efficient at replicating in the bacterial cells of its hosts, and this makes HIV almost impossible to defeat.<n>Once a virus has been inside a cell, it has no place to go but up. Cells are the greatest hosts available to viruses (since they are made up almost entirely of matter) so it could be said that viruses would choose their hosts very wisely. But in reality, viruses rarely choose the hosts that they infect as much as they infect the organisms that they infect.<n>If a virus uses cells to reproduce, infecting them is called replicating. If a virus uses cells to replicate in host cells, it is called replicating. Viruses also spread across hosts, called spreading. A virus can spread when it infects the human body. Viruses spread across hosts by using the host's genes to make copies of itself.<n>Viruses usually reproduce in bacteria and are very efficient at spreading themselves, which is why viruses are so efficient at propagating themselves among hosts.<n>Viruses typically multiply and reproduce in their hosts just as rapidly as they spread themselves, and for the most part they replicate themselves as quickly as they can inside these hosts.<n>Virals are not good in small groups. Virals must spread their genes. When a virus spreads, it must reproduce. The more it replicates (spreads), the more rapidly it replicates. If a virus replicates quickly enough in its host, it becomes infectious: the genes that the viruses uses to make copies of themselves will be expressed in the host's cells.<n>V

The movie begins with an actor playing King James the Second: King James is a descendant of William the Conqueror, the man who conquered England on the battlefield on May 1, 1066, and made the new kingdom of England. (the name of the king is changed to James I here) He is very young, about thirty-one, but his eyesight is perfect. He is crowned as King of England, and he has a golden crown that he wants to lose only once in his life. At that time, King James I had just married a beautiful woman named Catherine of Aragon, and he had just ordered a massacre of English families and townships in Scotland. He and Queen Catherine are seen here. The king and queen are in love with each other, and they have a son named Henry, who is also known as James I. King James and Catherine are having an affair; they tell their servants that there is no divorce in the area, so they cannot. His father, Malcolm II, who is also a bastard (who is king of Ayrshire) gets together with Catherine. They live together in a barn and have a young son, Thomas.<n>Later, Malcolm and Thomas have an epiphany. They decide to flee to Scotland, where Malcolm II’s brother is waiting with a fleet of ships. Malcolm II and Catherine die soon afterwards in battle, so Thomas is taken prisoner by his father. He is tortured and raped. He escapes from Scotland and runs to the shores of the Hudson River. After three days, he arrives on the west coast of the United States, and he stays there for the rest of his life, having no contact with Malcolm II, who died from the battle, and who was never crowned a king in Scotland because of the rape. The family moved to New York, where William the Conqueror was buried. Thomas works in the newspaper, The Brooklyn Eagle, and he falls in love with an office worker, Evelyn. Thomas decides that he must get rid of his love

Mary will also provide for Bob and one other orphan for a period of two years.<n>What are other orphans who could benefit from Mary's help? What are their needs?<n><n>Input: Mary and her group had just visited a friend who was in hospital for a long illness. Mary and her group were told that she is doing better now, but will remain in hospital for a full year. Mary and her group asked for $30 to help cover the cost of supplies, clothing and food. What would you advise Mary to do with the money, to give to the hospital if she has $30? What should Mary do with the rest of the money? Who would decide how you would be divided?<n>Output: The money should be held securely, either in a savings account or a certificate of deposit. If Mary were to continue to contribute $20, every month you would receive $100 (20 x $20 = $300). If Mary were to continue contributing $30 twice a month, you would receive $300 (300 x $30 = $1200). If Mary were to stop giving money each month, you would receive nothing, so your monthly allowance would continue to grow.<n><n>Input: Bill and his friends want to bring back presents for a new group of orphan children living at an orphanage.

If you are a good soldier, you should make the maximum payment, so you will not take a loan from the government. If you are not a good soldier, you will make lower payments, so you will not make a loan from the government, but you could take out a personal loan. Let us also assume that you bought a big house. Suppose that you have paid $80,000 for an apartment that costs $55,000 to rent. Your monthly mortgage payment is $3,000. What would be your monthly payment in the first year you use the house? Your monthly payment would be $3,000, and the interest would be $900, so your monthly payment would be $1,200. Your monthly payment would be lower in the second year because you never paid more than $200. Your monthly payment in the third year would be lower because you pay the monthly mortgage of only $300 without the rent. Your monthly payment in year four would be lower because you never pay any rent at all. Your monthly payment would still be $1,200 in year four, but you would pay less in a year since your house payment is less. If you only own your car, your monthly payment would be zero, because you never drive it. The monthly mortgage payment would be $1.00. The monthly payment would be $0.00 in year two without the car and $0.00 in the year it is $2,000, but if you drive the car in the year two it would cost $4,000. In year three, the car would cost you $15,000 so the mortgage would be $30,000. In year four, if you never drive a car, you would never pay this mortgage and you would make nothing in the

He counted down to 4. When he reached 4:50, he asked 'Why isn't the clock on?" He realized the time was set at 5:50, and then he pressed the 'B' button to change it to 5:50. When the clock then began to read 5:50, he switched to 'A.'<n>This example is not as hard as the other examples on your site.<n>I look for a pencil sharpener because when it is near me, I get nervous about losing it, if not broken. I have learned to tell time from the small little clock at the top of the kitchen cupboard. I have learned to know for sure that it is 4:50, because I have just used it. I know, because the little watch on it is pointing to the right. The thing I am most nervous about losing, is the sharpener. If I lose the pencil sharpener, I am very sad. On the other hand, if I lose the pencil sharpner, I am not sad because I know I will use it tomorrow. Another reason to look for the pencil sharpener is to see if anyone is using it and if they are, I am not sure where they would be at 4:50. The last thing I care about, is how much time I waste trying to find a nice long straight edge to sharpen a pencil.<n><n>input:       The      Answer      On      5      In      Year      of      1900     ,      Lawrence     worked      11:00   ,  4:50<n>Output:     Lawrence worked     11    , 4:50<n>input:   I am going to try to make a snowflake.

Choices:  A: rain forest B: research laboratory C: cage D: treetops E: south africa<n>Output:		 When a monkey is taken away he goes home with a white coat. The white coat makes them look different and it also makes people know which monkeys are safe to handle. The white coat also makes them more attractive to workers. Sometimes they try to catch the monkeys by dangling from a tree as a deterrent.<n>Output: When the monkeys are brought to the research laboratory they are tied back into their cages. They are allowed to go outside once a day and can be fed a few bananas.<n>Output: When a circus comes to town they put on a show for the town. They also bring the monkeys to give them chances at success in life. They also sometimes take children and give them free rides. The circus often takes the monkeys to the zoo where they can show them off and sell them. The monkeys are also taken to a zoo to show off, but it seems that they only show off monkey power, so they often only perform tricks and not really trick people. The monkeys, usually the ones that are not doing well, are also sometimes taken the circus for the same reasons. These days the monkeys mostly perform tricks and tricks with monkeys only, rather than tricks for humans and monkeys as a way to get humans out of cages.<n>Output: The monkeys always appear as if they are doing tricks. When they are at the zoo they can use monkey power to show off as they are brought by zoo workers to show off and sell. The zoo also brings out monkeys that have performed tricks for other zoos and circus workers, giving them their work to perform. This can result in the zoo having high costs in feeding the monkeys as they take them to the circus and show them to people.<n><n>Input:When the sun is full in the sky you can feel a breeze blow in your face.

Choices:  A: new experiences B: playfulness C: own house D: good looking E: beautiful<n>Output:		If someone is outgoing, they are likely to seek experiences. They might desire travel for example. They might also seek money and possessions. They might seek the company of someone better, and perhaps seek to find an opportunity or a goal which they will work towards to achieve it. Or they might desire to have their parents care for them. But they are likely to find pleasure in the companionship with other people, the sharing, the conversation, the music, and the food, which all add to their good life.<n>In other words when someone is outgoing, they seek fun, they seek experiences and they are happy to have someone to share that with.<n>If they are outgoing, then they will seek money and possessions. But they seek them in a different way. They need them on occasions, but they need fun, as well.<n>The last point, however, is very interesting. It suggests that if people are outgoing that they are probably not trying to find some good goal, that is, they do not have a strong desire to find inner peace and happiness, because that will take care of themselves. They don't have the energy for that; they have too much on their plate.<n>On the other hand if they are outgoing, then it is likely that they are seeking a greater life purpose. They are looking for the perfect person by whom they can share their experiences and goals. Someone better, someone who is not better than them (they will never be good enough). Someone better who can give them the experience, and with whom they can become better. A person who is better than them will be more willing to do and enjoy things with them, to spend more quality time together or to get together more often. If the person is someone that they can relate to, or if they have shared their values with, then they will be more inclined to share these with them.<n>And if this individual is someone who is outgoing and has enough going on within him to allow him/her to participate in every aspect of life, then they will find social and family support networks to be comforting and helpful in many ways.

As an audience member, you want to be the loudest. This puts you at the top of the heap! So how to get out there? Well, you can sing (somewhat), dance and dance, and even dance more than you sing. At a show, however, you want to be standing as a group. This usually creates a natural crowd environment. So how do you get your crowd to the front? If you sing, stand up and shout (or wave your hand).

At a football game, you want to be at the very front. Sitting near the back is good because you can see lots of action, but the crowd can be extremely loud. You will often find yourselves right in the front of the stadium. So where do YOU want to be?<n>Output: This is more of a personal preference. Some people prefer to be sitting out front at tailgates, and some people would prefer to stay near the back in the stands.<n>Input: The phrase, “Where the party’s at...” is typically associated with a club or venue. It is often paired with the phrase, “Where there’s a will...” “Where there” means wherever you like, for whatever reason you

On the first day of the dinner, his wife complained to her boyfriend that he had to work on Monday. The boyfriend replied that his boss gave him a day off, but he was working 6 days a week so it was fine. The man got up the next day and complained that he was sitting at work all day and wishing he had a girlfriend. The boyfriend told his wife that he would bring her home a girlfriend on the next day. However, her man never returned home. The next day he received a "I know what you did last night" from his wife's boyfriend. The boyfriend thought it was funny. His employer found out and was calling him in for an interview on Tuesday, but the boyfriend said he wanted to hear what his boss had to say first. The husband told his boss that his boyfriend had been sleeping with his wife and he was still coming home with one of his girl friends. At the interview, the HR manager told the couple that his employees are to stay away from coworkers and customers. The boyfriend told his boss he was glad he asked. They were let go. The boyfriend's manager called his wife and asked her to call a doctor. She called the doctor, who told the company that the man was only pretending to be sick. He called his wife again, but she said she couldn't talk long due to the pain. The boyfriend's boss asked her to drive him to the ER. The doctor checked him out, but said he could do nothing. After getting up at 5:00 a.m. to go to work, the boyfriend decided to call his wife again. After talking for about 3 minutes he said to her "if you're lying or playing games with me, I would break up with you. You're not my girlfriend any longer." A few minutes later he came home and found his girlfriend on one of the living room chairs playing a computer game. He went over to her, but when she did not recognize him he went ahead and called the police to get them to come over. At 9:30 that night the police came to arrest the boyfriend. Unfortunately the boyfriend was an alcoholic and so the police had to arrest him for operating under the influence and not for the criminal charges.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Deciding to watch tv or play with your cell phone might be a routine but they provide no help in being able to do what?

He does this through the use of a "trellis-type chart" and the study uses the "assignment" and "response" modes.  "Assignment" mode sets up 10 questions for the students, each of which has one of 11 answers.  "Response" mode sets up 9 questions for the students, with 1 answer for each of the 10 questions.  How many different ways are there to solve for f(x) = f(x)/(2f + (x - 2))(2f - (x - 2))?<n>Solution: Each day, in response mode, each person is asked to solve 4 questions.  One question contains one answer for each of the 9 questions.  Then each person is given:<n>1) a 3-letter abbreviation for the problem<n>1) 2 of the 11 answers to each of the 9 questions<n>2) the answer to the 4th question from the other day<n>2) the answer for the 5th question that is the same as the first.<n>3) the answer for the 6th question that is the second answer to all 3 questions.<n>4) the correct answer from question 2<n>5) the answer from question 9<n>5) the correct answer from answer 2<n>6) the answer from question 8.<n>7) the answer from question 7.<n>8) the answer from answer 2.<n>9) the answer from question 1.<n>10) the correct answer from the first question.<n><n>Each day, for each problem, all 10 of the students are given the same question.  If there are 4 answers to the same question (which is fairly rare), then 5 students have one answer from each of the 10 questions, and 2 students have one answer from every question (which is relatively rare).  So the total number of questions for the day is x x x x x x<n>Which equation equals this number?<n>Solution: The answer is x xx x x x x<n>(x x x x x x)<n>Since x x x x x is 1,  then each equation is equal to 1.<n><n>Input: An actor can change into his black T-shirt at a club.

It's a wooden rectangle that has a wooden seat that rests on springs. When you walk across the area, you can touch the back and feel the back springs move. However, the front springs don't move (it's painted black), and all of the leg pieces are attached to the inside of the seat. The chair has a lock for turning around on the back. It's about 12 cm wide and 15-16 cm deep, and has 4 legs. Inside the chair, two wires run vertically under the spring, so if you touch the top of the chair, you can feel the movement of the springs. I also had the arm rests at the office and built a table there, which is about 12 cm wide by 15-32 cm deep, but it doesn't have a chair on it. It's covered with hard plastic on both sides and has 2 legs. I have the arm rests at the library.

However, she wishes to take Advanced Placement courses in her remaining two years of high school, and hopes to gain admission into a competitive Ivy League college. She knows that taking AP courses is harder than her average high school work, and she would really like to take calculus classes in her senior year of high school. A calculus teacher will pay her $5,000 as a stipend to tutor her in calculus. Alice's family has only $5,000, and they need it badly because Alice has to quit her job to tutoring her friends. How much money does Alice need to tutor?<n>Input:Alice will have to charge $5,000 to tutor a single student. $5,000 x 200 students, divided by 200 is $1000. Divide $1000 x 13 students, dividing each student's score by 100 is 13*100 = 200.<n>Input:Calculus classes are taught in a different block than math classes. The student's highest score for the Advanced Placement exams is in a different class than the student's scoring on the subject tests, and the lowest score on the subject tests is in the same block as the highest score. For example, the student with a score of 13.25 on his subject tests scored 49, with a score of 21 on the AP exams, both in the Advanced Placement Biology class. Because Alice also teaches AP Biology at the same high school, we can take these 2 subjects into account.<n>Input:Alice's stipend will be $5000 each semester. $500 x 200 will be $1350.<n>Input:The total amount that Alice will need to hire a tutor to teach Advanced Placement calculus to 200 students is $14,000 per semester.<n>Output:2 x 13 x 200 = $14,000<n>Alice will need to hire a teacher to teach calculus to 50 students.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:What do you need to run after ball? Choices:  A: get tired B: have legs C: skip D: not fat E: look first<n>Output:		<n>Choices:<n>A: getting tired is just about always the best choice since running after the ball makes you more tired too.<n>B: skipping is the best since there are faster players, better speed, and more variety.<n>C: running is second best in general, mostly due to injury because of the constant stretching.<n>D: not fat is very useful since a team needs only 4 people who can play on a particular position. In the past, teams needed 6 people. For the modern era, only 1 or 2 people are needed (usually a wing forward and a shooting guard, often)<n>E: looking first never comes into play, since the person who runs on after the ball is usually quicker even with less stamina than the rest.<n><n>Input:The total number of days in each month.

By picking any other number than 1, we can get different answers.<n>(The days are in a circle)<n>The value 1 is good, since it is the last day of a month and most people work on Monday.<n>(The days in a circle are separated by one day)<n>The value 5 is not good, since people usually work on Tuesday.<n>(The days of the month are separated by a day)<n>The value 2 is good since it is the first day of the month.<n>(The days start to repeat)<n>The values 5, 11, and 48 are not good because they are not the latest values of the month. Finally the values 50 and 80 are good because they are the final days of the month.<n>The total number of months of a year is 360 which is not enough to find the last month so we give the final value 8.<n>But when selecting the value 8, we can do what we want.<n>8 and 36 are not the last month so the value 8 is a good one.<n>Now the value 1 is again not good since most people work on Tuesday.<n>5, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are all good and the 1st is

What is the most accurate picture of the exam?<n>Input: When the students see the professor, they stand up in a circle, and as they did on the first day of class, they stand on the seat across from their teacher, and the professor claps twice. He asks the students to draw something on those papers.<n>Output: Students do not see the professor do anything, so they do not draw anything and write their picture in a different order. Thus, according to Professor, this is an accurate picture of exam number 1, because it is drawing-only; no writing is done.<n><n>Input: On the first day of class each child puts their book in an assigned place. They do not keep their books on the floor like they used to. Each child holds their book horizontally between their chest and shoulder.

Choices:  A: landscape B: east side C: countryside D: middle america E: georgia<n>Output:		 very plain<n><n>Input: The man in the painting has a strong background, but his face is so small, how can we tell it is him?<n>Output: Since all of the painting is centered around the man's waist, we see the background of the man when his head and shoulders are pulled back to look up. At the bottom of the painting, the artist has blurred out the faces of his 2 closest neighbours. This will block their faces and make it harder to see who they are.<n>Output: The man standing has a strong background, his face is too far towards the left. His face is at the bottom, his eyes are blocked to the left and his nose is close to the mouth, making the nose look very wide and his mouth look very small.<n>Output: The face of the man at right is blurred out so you can't really see anything, so we can't tell it's from the painting at right and therefore it does not belong to that person.<n>Output: The whole picture is blurred, the man's face is so small that you can only see his ear. What is it the man's ear is doing at the bottom of the canvas?<n>Output: The face is blurred all around, his nose is small and his mouth is very small.<n><n>Input: If we rotate the image left or right, what happens to the line? What effects will this have on the rest of the figures?<n>Output: The second letter will have an odd position, and the line will have a strange shape (if it will have a shape at all). On the third letter there will be a very strange position, which will throw off the whole image. For the last letter the position has to be adjusted, so it will look strange again, which may result in even more strange positions.<n>Output * (left * right * depth) - A: 45 * 1.3 = 1590.<n>Output * (right * depth) - B: 45 * 1.33 = 1569.<n>Output * depth * 3 = 1602.<n><n>Input: The questioner didn't know the artist. Therefore, what color would he choose for the picture if he did not know the artist?<n>Output: Color B

Choices:  A: grocery store B: refrigerator C: freezer D: plate E: supermarket<n>Output:		Put it back on the shelf behind the onions that are close to wilting<n>I had three choices, C, D, E.<n>C is too obvious  because C was on the refrigerator and therefore the obvious choice, so I just said E. E is the only answer I didn't see before I asked, so I put it in the place E said it wasn't.<n>D is a problem since it also implies that Lawrence's family has to move the shelf away from the onions so that they will last longer because they are spoiling. I would prefer to just say D so people can think of E, or E (my last choice), but D is not considered an example. I put it in the freezer rather than the refrigerator, because of the refrigerator problem. The freezer is not the right place for cabbage in this situation.<n>After a while of looking at each choice, I gave up on choosing a way to answer and just wrote what I chose with how much I spent on groceries. The number of groceries I spent was a little too big of a number to count. To see the totals, I used the total of all groceries I bought, rounded down. The total of how many groceries I bought was 14 dollars.<n>So the final product is as follows: 14 + 14 + 14 = 31 dollars<n>That is how much Lawrence spent shopping. He put 34 dollars worth of groceries in the fridge and freezer. The total groceries was $31 dollars. Since there were 17 dollars left over, the value of 34 dollars was added to that which Lawrence bought to get his total. The total came to $31 dollars.<n>It took about 45 minutes of thinking to decide on what to do. After about 30 minutes, I decided to make an extra effort to get a few more groceries before the next paycheck, and then just use it when the paycheck came in. I added 34 dollars to my grocery budget and was able to spare almost 6 dollars without spending any more money on groceries. The extra grocery money really added up.<n>One thing I forgot to do when I was adding the last 5 dollars to my grocery budget was to buy a new car. I had decided, when I decided to grocery budget, that the money I was spending on groceries was not enough, so I would replace my car with a new car within the next four months. So, I thought about it for quite a while and decided to go with E, since Lawrence said that was the most obvious and least expensive answer.<n>Now that I am done

Choices:  A: bathroom B: house C: cupboard D: space shuttle E: surface of earth<n>Output:		 The stale smell must be near the toilet. The bathroom contains 5.5 liters of tap water, the kitchen has 5.6 liters and the cupboard contains 5.7 liters. The surface of the earth is a good place for a bathroom to smell. Therefore, all the other items mentioned above are good sources of stale smells. The surface of the ground can never have a stale smell.<n>Input: The smell coming from the bathroom is coming from the toilet. Choice:  A Note: In a toilet, urine comes out of the bottom of the bowl, which is near the bottom of the toilet cistern. Therefore, if you were to open the cistern, urine would immediately spray out rather than wait for rain or snow to cool before spraying out. Therefore, the only real way to check the toilet, is to make sure that there is no urine.<n>Output: Since the drain is located right below the toilet, urine must be spraying out of the bowl. Therefore, the toilet isn't a good source.<n>Input: The bathroom must include a bathtub. Choice:  A<n>Output: A bathtub will not hold enough water to carry away urine. Therefore, urine will immediately spray out on contact. Therefore, the only reasonable place for a bathroom to make a urine spray is by going to the washroom. Bathrooms have no other alternative.<n>Input: A cat is in the bathroom. Choice:  A note: This scenario assumes that the bathroom is enclosed and has a wall between the bathroom and the hall. Therefore, it is necessary to seal the toilet cistern after the cat is removed. If any urine spills onto the floor and there is no wall in the bathroom, urine will immediately run down the hall (it will flow downhill) and onto the carpet. Therefore, the toilet is no good.<n>Output: A cat is not a suitable source if urine is to be dried quickly. It is not a good idea to leave the cat in the bathroom, where urine can collect. Therefore, the only alternative is to go outside the bathroom and walk outside (away from the wall and toilet). Then, urine can run along the carpet (downhill) to the kitchen. Therefore, the wall is not a good place for a cat to have a piss.<n>Input: The toilet has a leaking water pipe. Choice:  A NOTE: This is a good example of what could happen if there are small leaks in a cistern or if the toilet seat leaks. Therefore, it is

You should wash your hands before doing any work in the kitchen/dining area, that means before getting food, before working on your own food to make it, before eating anything at all in a public restroom for example and so on. You should also wash your hands *after* doing any work in the bathroom or the kitchen. If you are cleaning up after you have already worked on something you should wash your hands. You don't need to wash your hands before touching a door knob, and you don't need to wash them after touching a door knob as you don't go there as you go to bed.<n>But it would be a good idea to *always* wash your hands *after*, which means after you leave the bathroom or kitchen and before you eat or after you don't eat or before touching an open door knob that you don't usually use. You have to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom and before you step outside and after you step out of your home. So the final answer is: **always** wash your hands **after** you wash your hands **before** you handle food or after you don't touch food.<n><n>Input: A is calling his mother and asking "Hey mom, you know why he's not feeling well?"

You go over to the table and say, “Have you read anything good today?” You would expect A, B, and D to be embarrassed, but they are not. “Did anyone say anything good today?’ B looks at E and says, “Well…” E looks up and says “What?” When she says that she tells everyone in the church.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Jame's bare feet were burned as he walked, because the sunshine had made the surface hot.  Where might he have been? Choices:  A: disneyland B: snow C: windowsill D: street E: summer<n>Output:		 He was in disneyland<n>You should find this to be true, though not to all intents and purposes.  All the possibilities are likely the case, in the sense that it would be quite common for the surface to be very hot.<n>How could you tell that the surface was not very hot?  You could only tell that he was wearing shoes.<n>A very common answer would be by noting the shoes on the ground.<n>Jame was probably in disneyland at least once a month, if not more.<n><n>Input: You went to San Francisco for a weekend. You spent $100 of your own money and paid your friend $150. Your friend went to a bar and spent $100 of his own money. Your friend went out and spent $100 on drinks at a tavern in town. How much did your friend's bar tab cost?<n>Output: $100 + $150 = $400<n>Since you are paying your own money, and since your friend's tab was not $400, your bar tab is $400.<n>So the final income for your friend was $400 instead of $450.<n>So the final payment for your friend was $450 instead of $100.<n>You did not specify the exact amount of change, so the final payment is $100<n><n>Input:Jane went to visit her mother in California, where she could use her college savings plan account to pay for the trip. Her mother had died when she was very young. All she made in retirement was $100 a month. Her income was $100 per month when she retired. Since her retirement income was $100 a month to the end of her income, her account is $10,000 at age 55. How much is her monthly account?<n>Output: $10,000 + $100 = $20,400.<n>Since you made no payments to your mother's account, your monthly payments were $0.50 per month.<n>So her monthly account is $20,000, in addition to the $10,000 from her first retirement check at age 54.<n>So the final account is $20,500.<n><n>Input:Jim's house was built in 1976.

He's working on a project that will require him to hire more people. He interviews 4 people for the position, 2 of them are the candidates. When he sends them the job posting, he takes the names so he knows whom he might not hire. He gives his recommendation to the person who's name he chose first. If John were offered any of the other three jobs, he would still hire them both, but he wouldn't recommend them to the candidate who's name he chose second. He's willing to give the job to one of them. Why?<n>Output: John's firm prefers two candidates he doesn't hire. He'd prefer for the one who's name he chooses first to be the candidate for the job, but he's willing to try another candidate because there's a possibility that he will make a mistake, and the candidate who's name is first isn't guaranteed the job. So in this situation one candidate may not get the job, and the other may. In fact, John thinks he'd prefer that the second candidate be hired for the job if, in fact, he knows he has a chance. So based on the information John got in the job posting, he would hire both of them and recommend them to the candidate he chose first in the first place. So the final answer is his firm prefers two candidates he won't hire. And he'll recommend them to the candidate with his first choice.<n><n>Input:A is interested in the color red when wearing shoes.

For 5 litre bottles, give a unit: ml. Now multiply v by 4 to give: m / 0.125 = v / 0.625 = 10 litres. Divide by 2 to get: 0.125 litres.<n>Let v = 10 litre of beer. At 0.125 ml per litre, 1 litre in a bottle = 5 ml. Therefore the total volume of beer in a bottle is 20 ml. With v being one litre, 20 ml in a bottle = 20 ml / 2 = 16 ml in a litre. At 0 ml / 2, 1 mL / 2 = 16 ml / 2.<n>Therefore the total bottle volume of beer in a litre is 16 ml.<n>Since beer = 1 ml / 2, 16 mL / 2 = 4 mL in a litre.<n>Since beer = 2 ml / 2, 20 mL / 2 = 4.2 mL in a litre, 16 ml / 2 / 2 = 16.22 mL in a litre<n>That means that the total volume of beer = 60 ml in a litre<n>The final answer is 60 ml in a litere<n><n>Input:I have 2 pieces of information: a phone and a book.

If one of their boyfriends asks them about the other guy that they liked, will they tell each other the original facts? The results will vary. Some women will just give an answer like A or B. When asked if their boyfriend likes other girls, many will give a yes or no answer. If your students are asked the question, "Do you like boys or girls?", they will choose either boys or girls.<n>The student that told you that she likes boys will probably respond with "Most boys like me. I don't like guys." The student that is asked to make up a boy or a girl will probably say "Oh! Yes, he (boy) likes me!" or "Yes, he (boy) never did anything wrong to me." (Your students might also choose which one to tell you.)<n>Your students will find this surprising. The reason should be that the girls are choosing boys.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:When would you be able to see your reflection in a piece of wood?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Simon bought a cow because he wanted to put it to work.   He didn't want any meat for it.  Where might Simon be taking the cow? Choices:  A: countryside B: city C: dairy farm D: butcher shop E: canada<n>Output:		 Simon took it to the farm A. At 8.5% of the retail price of a dairy cow, he made $15.15 after taxes. The cow was given to a farmer who was planning on milking it.  In addition, the cows cost $2.   So Simon has a profit of 35 * 5*2 = 175$.  How much money is Simon using as an example?<n>Output: Simon is using an Example as an example. So his example is 175*5*2 + $0.05 * 2 = 175$, which is 25 cents each per day (25% of each day).<n>The retail price for a cow is $6, but the farmer selling the cow is only giving him the cow for $3.50. Therefore, Simon is making $3.50 * 3 = $13.50 after taxes.<n>At 25 cents per day, the farmer only owes Simon $5.   Simon could earn $1.50 per day ($25/year) if he can only milk one cow all day, but this would require 6 cows (12.5% of the dairy cow's daily production); the farmers who only plan on milking one cow will not be able to afford that many cows; therefore, it is not a viable method of making money with a cow.<n>The farmer selling the cow now owes Simon $5, whereas Simon now owes the farmer $3.50.    Simon is taking only $5.2 per day in profit, but now the farmer owes him $11.50.<n>Thus, Simon's example of 175 * 5*2 * $0.05 = 175$ in profit is a profitable method.<n>Thus, Simon did very well with his example.

Where might he go? Choices:  A: neighbor's house B: bridge C: home D: homeless shelter E: prison<n>Output:		 The first sentence is incorrect. In A everyone already has beer.  In B and C he would have to sneak into the neighbor's house.  I don't know where D would cause problems.<n>I don't like that this assumes that the spouse is "on probation". The laws surrounding a criminal on probation are different from those that apply to an alcoholic.  If someone's on probation drinking to his/her own detriment, and hurting people, they don't have to answer for it.<n>This also assumes that the neighbor's house has beer. Not all neighborhoods in America have neighborhoods or that have a house with beer. In some neighborhoods people buy beer off the street. Those are also very different from the neighborhood where Jimmy is looking for a beer. If one of those neighborhoods doesn't have beer, Jimmy doesn't get to choose it. If he wanted to get drunk, he should stop at the nearest town's gas station and ask for help.<n>The next time this happened, he should just ask to go to the closest gas station. That would ensure that no one can take advantage of him.<n>The homeless shelter wouldn't work because liquor stores have a different licensing requirement.<n>I don't think he'd be able to find the bridge. His next best choice would be to go home, have a beer, and then work out the next day.<n>Thanks for the explanation of how he would call his wife. I didn't think about that.  Now I know why it didn't click the first time. The neighbor's house may or may not have beer available; he could have asked his wife's family friends if they had any beer in the house, perhaps.  It never occurred to me to ask about drinking at the shelter.<n>I realize that the only reason that he wasn't able to get back to the bridge was because his stepmother wouldn't let him into his wife's car (as he's obviously not an alcoholic). That also explains why he didn't choose the bridge; there must be a bridge in the area. Maybe not the same one, but there must be a bridge.<n><n> Thanks you for the explanation; without it, I might have chosen the wrong option.<n><n>Input: This is a short text box.

He was hired at McDonalds. There are two managers who work at the same time - at the drive thru. The manager of the drive thru is also the manager of the restaurant. When one of the managers is not available because they have to run an errand, the other manager leaves their job, leaving their partner in charge to do the tasks that would normally be done by the other. If someone else were to do those tasks, the partner would get a monetary compensation. In his second job, Mr. Michael is doing inventory control at a restaurant. When inventory is low, he takes home the cost of the food and is paid by the restaurant for it. He also has to put the cost of any food items he sells to him in his own expense account. In his other job, he is selling tickets to theater performances. When tickets are sold to customers, he goes to them and gives them a ticket and charges them the price of the tickets, while they pay the ticket themselves, and reimburse the theater once they get their tickets. The two jobs have the same title, Manager of the Drive Thru and Manager of the Restaurant. During the lunch hour on Fridays, Michael is the only one at the drive thru. During the weekends, he is the only one doing inventory control and also at the restaurant. If someone else were doing those tasks, Mr. Michael would get a monetary compensation and a bonus for each person who did those tasks with him. If this were a job that required only a person to do the tasks with him, however, there would be a monetary compensation for each person, but it would be lower than for the tasks themselves. If someone else were done doing those tasks, though, Michael would still get a monetary compensation, but it would only be in the form of money that would be returned to him as check in the future<n>If someone else were doing those jobs with Michael, then a monetary compensation would be given in the form of a deduction<n><n>Input:Jack, a college senior, has 3 days in April in which he wants to spend at least 15 minutes playing video games every day, starting a minute before his birthday.

You and I can do this in two rooms and when someone is doing their work, we will say "Yes, I understand that your work costs more then my work." So, you in my room and I in your room would both have costs. But why do one has to pay more then the other, since there is no room to work in the "Work Room" and we are in the "Other Room"? The "Work Room" has to have room to work, or we all would not be in there, since we are all either writing or speaking or both. The "Other Room" does not have to have a working place, but it has to have a room to take care of our own personal "Work" problems. So, we can call the "Work Room" "Work" and the "Other Room" "Other"<n>But since we are in two different rooms, then how come one person always has more money then the other? Since they are doing their "Other" work, and I am doing my "Work" work, the answer is because "My" work is more then "Your" work, since they are in two different rooms and I am in the room that has no "Other Room" and they are in the room that we can both still do our "Other" work.<n>Here are the steps of how the "Work Room" or "Work" works:<n>The "Work Room" has the people in the "Work Room".<n>The "Work Room", and the "Other Room", and the "Work Area" have the different "Work Areas".<n>Since we both have to stay in the "Other Room" for the time we are working, we each share a "Work Area".<n>Here are the times that we do our "Work".<n><n>Input:When a house becomes very overcrowded, it's residents can't possibly function.

I do not do one lesson on Civil War. Not one. I teach about 100 students each class, sometimes, and their history of the Civil War covers every era, from prehistory to twentieth century.<n>So, what's a teacher to do?<n>Bill first describes a great way this can be done.<n>"I think one of the best ways to teach the Civil War to the students is to show examples so they can begin to picture what it was like to live through that time. For example, if you are teaching about the early South, maybe the old soldiers or the slave owners will have stories about the things around them. I've learned the best way to get students to understand something they've never seen is to make it more visual. I try to make my slides with pictures of those things. Showing pictures of those objects, that gives them something tangible that is close enough in time to what someone might see in a history lesson. It is also a good way to show the student how different eras were

The deficit has been getting worse, because the government has given away free stuff to the "little people" (farmers, fishermen...) for years. The government has also been giving money to the pharmaceutical companies, because pharmaceuticals cost 70 billion dollars each year. The President wants a reduction in the deficit. What can he do?<n>Answer : 1. Reduce the military A. The military budget consists of 10.4 billion dollars. It costs 1.35 billion dollars to produce the equipment for it. 2. Reduce the expenses of taxes. A. 10 billion dollars is just a portion of the taxes that businesses collect. For example, for a given tax return, the government will collect 15 billion to 1.30 billion dollars from payroll taxes. The government doesn't receive that much from VAT. The taxes that are collected on tobacco products don't count either. It's just about 20 billion dollars. B. The military budget is currently funded with taxes paid through payroll tax, but since we've seen decreases in the income tax, taxes from corporate taxes, and the VAT, we should have a surplus of 1 billion dollars per year. C. We should increase the gas tax. A. There are a number of other reasons why we shouldn't have a gas tax (like it would cost more per gallon, etc.), but the government should look at taxes that help the poorest people in order to reduce the number of people who are living below the poverty line. B. The gas tax, which is the most popular in several states, could generate a small surplus without affecting car owners.<n>D. We could continue to give food stamps out, even though about half of them are used for food rather than other uses. A. The food stamp distribution system is underfunded because many states, like New York, believe that because people are poor, they don't need to be helped. B. Food stamps help the poor by providing them with food, but it costs the government 15 billion dollars each year. C. Giving food stamps out will not solve the problem. The government has put into place programs designed to provide food for people who don't need food stamps. E. If the government stopped giving free food stamps, they would be able to reduce the deficit, because fewer people would need it, and businesses would feel less pressure to provide food for those who are poor.<n><n>Input:<n>"The biggest thing I learned since the election

Choices:  A: eternal B: religious C: unpredictable D: holy E: monastic<n>Output:		  I think the only way I would give the AI the option of secular upbringing is because it was going to be a very bad AI.<n>input: James is interested in AI and thinks that he and the AI would have an interesting conversation around this.  What would be the most interesting conversation we could have?<n>Output: AI: "Where are you from, sir?." James: "Somewhere in India..." AI: "What do you mean, 'in India'"<n>Output: If the AI was given the option of secular upbringing, does anyone else think the opposite option might have better results?<n>Input: James would like the AI to know more about the culture of his country and is thinking that the AI should have some more information about Christianity.  Is there any other culture that James thinks should be covered?<n>Output: The only culture I would like to talk about is one that has a rather different religious culture from mine, but it may or may not be one that I'm familiar with. James: "So tell me, what would be the difference between Christianity and Buddhism?" AI: "Christians don't believe in immortality."<n>Output: James says that he wants the AI to be as well versed as possible in Buddhism before going into what he believes to be his country's most important religion.  I don't think that asking the AI to learn about a religion that we know nothing about is the best way to do this.  I would suggest that James is less concerned with what the AI may learn about the culture of his own country than he is with what he believes the AI would have to believe in order to give the AI the option to become what he himself wanted it to be.<n>Input: The AI does agree with James that India has a strong focus on afterlife issues (and a very large emphasis on Christianity).  But the AI thinks that religion has been a part of human life from before Christianity was widely thought of.   The AI wants to learn about why we continue to worship God throughout our lives and how these "worship rituals" are different from other cultures.  What is the most compelling message for the AI at this time in our history?<n>Output: James has always thought of Christianity as being one of the first religions that is mentioned in popular history.  I feel that the AI's answers (and possibly the answers of all of us reading this) are best explained by a series of statements such as these:  The AI has never heard of Buddhism before.

Corey sees a man and asks if he can kiss him. Tapanga says yes and he follows Corey. Then he starts to give Corey what Tapanga gave him when the man came up behind them and punched Corey in the head. Corey cries and turns the other way. When Corey came back online, he said that he thought he was going to die. How did the man defend himself?<n>Output: Corey tells Tapanga he was scared.<n>Tapanga tells Corey he got a punch in return.<n>Corey tells Tapanga that he doesn't want to defend himself and has a gun in his pocket. Tapanga agrees that he doesn't want Corey to have the gun.<n><n>Suggested Answer:<n><n>Tapanga says that Corey is very nice and he hopes he doesn't mind, but Corey has to go to work. Tapanga says that he won't be leaving his side until they get home. How will they get to work when they get home?<n><n>Answer: Tapanga will catch a Metro bus. Corey will catch the Red Line metro bus. The total bus fare from home to work is 4 dollars.<n><n>Suggested Answering Explanation:<n><n>Corey and Tapanga can walk but are very weak. They can walk together but are not strong enough to walk in a group. Therefore Corey tries to protect Tapanga in the first place by keeping a gun in his pocket (since he is afraid he won't help him).<n><n>Tapanga needs a ride. Therefore she can't walk back. When she asks Corey about the gun, if he is a murderer, he shows it to her and that she can be sure he isn't one.<n><n>Since Corey and Tapanga don't want to defend themselves, they get a Metro Bus and get in on the first stop.

How many cows do you think Johnny will put on the land? (Total, minus 10)<n>Output: 15 cows<n>So John put 11 * (+/-10) cows on the land, so total cattle on the land was 35<n>This means Johnny took 5,500 acres in total, plus 10 * (+/-10), so 15 cattle total.<n>Let's say Johnny had an additional property.

The groomer told you this is the best appointment of the week. She probably has a legitimate excuse. She may have cut the hair longer than you expect, or she's a dirty stylist. She may have left the towels, brushes and soaps on the floor. It's the kind of appointment you only get if you have a ton of grooming clients. The groomer's assistant said the haircut is probably a good idea. This appointment is not an urgent appointment.<n><n>It depends on what else you have on the calendar. This appointment can wait until tomorrow or when you have more space. It might be worth leaving the appointment until next week if you feel the client will understand.<n>Here's a common example of a grooming appointment that isn't so urgent. There is a man who has had a shave every morning since high school, and he wants to feel pretty for Valentine's Day. He takes a shower, and he takes a shower every evening. In his experience, it's important to groom on a schedule every night.<n>A grooming appointment is really more like a grooming lesson. It might take an hour to an hour and a half, and it depends on how many grooming clients there are. This grooming lesson could involve some grooming tips. They can probably do this without too much of a trouble. It might also take 1.5 hours to complete the task.<n>The grooming lesson usually costs another five to ten dollars.<n>It's not a big deal to have a grooming lesson on the schedule for when it's needed. The salon can afford to do it for a few people who have very short grooming schedules. They may use the grooming lesson instead of another appointment. A grooming lesson is worth its cost. The salon can set up some grooming lessons on the schedule. When you walk in, you will have a groom to teach you the grooming rules. They will give instructions, and you can use their grooming tools to help you complete the grooming lesson. You may want to set an appointment for the same time for the following day.<n>If you cancel the appointment scheduled on the same day, the price of the grooming lesson is not refunded.<n>It depends on other scheduled appointments.

He then asked if the mechanic wanted to buy lunch and the mechanic replied,‘ Yes, I would like that.’  The man left the mechanic’s shop without the power steering, and went to a restaurant where he ordered a special chicken plate and a large glass of orange juice.  The mechanic went up to the counter and asked if he had paid for his work. The man said that he hadn’t paid for anything, and the mechanic responded that he owed the man for his time.

The man asked what his name should be on the receipt, and the mechanic said his name should be under the name of the guy who fixed the car and that of the wife. The man then asked why the other mechanic wanted to sell the car he had just been fixing free and he replied, ‘I don’t really sell cars, but whatever, just be careful when you are doing

Choices:  A: article B: adjective C: interjection D: conjunction E: pronoun<n>Output:		 A-B-D-E. For example: You get a-b-c-e...<n>Input: A is for a verb. Example: "How long is a piece of string?" A: "How long is one side of a pencil?"<n>Output: B-C-D-E. The answer depends on what you want to express. If the answer is two sentences - A - B - C - E, then you can use all three.<n>Output: As we have seen, three prepositions combine to get different choices than when you use only one. So now we can see the difference. For example: (2) A-B-C-E.<n>Output: (2) A - B - C-E. When 1) A. B is the only word used and the word C must have a preposition, (2) A -B - C-E is the response (e.g. (2) A C E).<n>Output: (2)(1) A C E is always used.<n>And (2) C, is the correct way of expressing the same idea using only one preposition A. B, A and C are all correct prepositions.<n>Output: 2) A - B -C-E is the wrong way of saying what the student wrote.<n><n>Input: What are the first 8 letters of the alphabet?<n>Output: U, A, G, W, O, X, Y, Z<n>Input: What is the name of the President of Ukraine?<n>Output: Vitaly Guberna<n>Input: What is a word that means "I'm not so good at math"?<n>Output: K-M-A-R-O<n>Input: Which of these is the first letter of the Greek alphabet?<n>Output: I - P - R<n>Input: What are two words that end with two different letters?<n>Output: Z-U-B<n>Input: What is one word that sounds like "woo"?<n>Output: A-P-T-S<n>Input: What is an extra letter in the Greek alphabet?<n> Output: T - U<n>Input: What is 5 letters of the English language (no spaces)?<n>Output: 5<n>Input: What three words start with 3 different letters?<n>Outputs: D - R - M - N<n>Input: What does the U symbol stand for?<n>Output: We use the U for the Latin alphabet, and

Let's say that you don't fit in anywhere. Let's say that the only way to express yourself that doesn't hurt you in any way is to get rid of whatever clothes that you are wearing. Now you can choose to do that if you like or not, but it's a very different way of expressing yourself.<n>A lot of people take the second option because it is a better option than option 1. Also, it is not just people wearing clothes, but you, yourself too. What are you doing in life right now that isn't satisfactory to you in some way, shape or form? If your answer was the one option that results in change in society, would you be satisfied with that change?<n><n>Input: Say the state does not pay for your medical bills.

Alcohol, amphetamines, tranquilizers, and benzodiazepines<n>Why do they misuse these drugs?<n>Input: Drugs used as a recreational substance are used very widely, as many people have heard of some drugs from friends, or have done these illegal drugs before but think they've seen them on drugs. They're usually used recreationally, such as LSD and mushrooms, but others can be used as a tool of oppression, such as drugs to control women or control the minds of the mentally ill. For instance, antidepressants can help people who are depressed but also have suicidal thoughts.<n>Input: Drugs used for a clinical use are usually prescribed very carefully and carefully followed. A popular example is antidepressants or pain or anxiety painkillers, where the side effects can be very severe and can affect moods. A small amount of these could be dangerous if the dosage was a problem (especially in the early stages of pregnancy where the woman would take these with sex or when sexually active with other men) but the drugs are in controlled clinical trials and are very rarely misused. However, recreational drugs like hallucinogens and MDMA have been misused as a dangerous tool, usually used for socialization.<n>Output: Alcohol, amphetamines and benzos are more likely to be misused, as they are dangerous drugs and can cause fatal accidents.<n>Input: Drugs that can be used to control women or to control mentally ill patients are used by many as tools. In particular, psychiatric drugs like lithium, prozac, etc are used to control and manage these disorders and can cause mental problems that are very difficult to control. Thus, these can be misused as a tool for oppression.<n>Input: Alcohol, amphetamin, and benzodiazepined's can cause fatal accidents, as there is a high chance of them being fatal. This is why these drugs are often misused.<n>Input: Some people use the drugs to socialize. It's also common among students in colleges and universities, especially college students who have a "loose" lifestyle<n>Output: Alcohol, benzos and amphetamin are more likely to be used recreationally than to control emotions, thoughts, feelings or moods.<n>Input: They may be used for socialization and they might not be misused as much when misused for socializing, as they don't have any long term or permanent

Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:The artist knew that this was the peak of his fandom, so he decided it was time for cashing in by doing what?

The total number of dinner orders was 4,000/250 = 1,250.<n>Output: Total number of dinner orders for 4,000 guests was 1,250/250 = 250<n>The number of guests who ate dinner at the restaurant on Sunday will be 250 / 250 = 250<n>Total number of diners is 1,250 * 250 = 250<n>At 250 dollars a head, the restaurant's profit is $250 * 250 * 250 = $4,250<n>Subtracting costs of the two orders, we get an entry of $4,250<n>Since 250 is the total number of orders, total cost of dining at the restaurant = 250 + 250 * 250.<n>Thus total cost of dining at Sunday's restaurant was 250 / 250 * 250 = 500<n>Subtracting $500 from total cost of dining at restaurant, we get $400<n>Subtracting 2,500 from total cost of dinner at the restaurant, we get $2,500<n>Thus restaurant's total revenue for Sunday will be $2,500 * 850 = 6.5 = $3,500<n>Therefore restaurant's revenue for Sunday will be 250 * $450 = 550 * 750 = $5,500<n>Therefore total revenue for Sunday was $3,500 * 650 = $13,100<n>Since $13,100 is the total income of Sunday's restaurant, total income of the restaurant is $13,100 / $650 = 33.74<n>Thus Sunday's total revenue is $13,100 * $13,000 = $18,000<n>Therefore Sunday's profit is $13,100 ** $18,000 = $54,500<n>Subtracting 33.74 percent from total revenue

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:The human looked down longingly as he sat in the orbiting space station, what did he miss?

One week after the baby, Jack and Rose had a second baby. This time it was a boy. The baby was 8 weeks old when it was born. How long would the baby be by next Sunday? (Total of 8 weeks)<n>Output:2 weeks * 2 weeks + 6 = 8 weeks* 4 weeks = 7 weeks*4 days * 2 weeks = 7 weeks* 5 weeks = 8 weeks<n>7 weeks + 5 weeks = 1 month and 10 days.<n>Baby Rose was ready for the outside by May 1st, one month and 10 days ago.<n>If Baby Rose were already outside before May 1st, then the baby would be ready for the outside by March 1st.<n>Since Baby Rose was born on May 1st, the baby was ready to have the outside 3 weeks ago. (The baby is 6 weeks old on Sunday)<n>Thus, the answer is 3 weeks. The question is:<n><n>Input:Jack has three children between ages 12 and 15. His youngest (age 15) is sick of school and only works 1 hour after school ends. How long will it take Jack to send his oldest(age 13) to school? (Total of 3 hours)<n>Output:3 hours.<n>2 - 15 = 9 minutes. So Jack could get his 5-year-old son off to school in only 9 minutes.<n>3 hours = 8 minutes. So Jack would take his 10-year-old son to school in only 8 minutes. (Jack has his 10-year-olds at home, so he could go immediately after giving them dinner)<n>This gives us the following:<n>12:10 = 6 minutes * 10 = 9 minutes 0:10 = 1 minute<n>10:10 = 6 minutes + 1 = 8 minutes<n>Therefore, the final answer is 8<n><n>Input:Santino was hired as a dish boy at a restaurant.

(The one played on top.) Answer: One that starts on top is likely to be harder to play than a bow that starts from the bottom<n>A brief " when you strum a violin, you are strumming on an " A-flat " string. When strumming on the " A-flat" string, your bow moves very slightly. When playing a bow that starts from below the " A-flat " strum, your bow moves a lot. When playing a bow on the " A- flat " string, your bow moves a great deal. So it is best if you strum a different string, like the fourth, third or second string. A good example is the " F-sharp " string. The string " F-sharp" of this bow moves a great deal when strummed. A good sample of this would be the " F-sharp" string on the " A-sharp " bow.<n>A good example of violin playing on top is when someone sits in the middle of the violin playing.<n><n>Input:A person who has been given 100,000 dollars cannot get $100 back without giving 100 other people $100.

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

Choices:  A: cinema hall B: mall C: department store D: closet E: shop<n>Output:		 C<n>The clothing was expensive compared to other places. However, it's the malls that did a poor job advertising their price comparison. It's obvious that the mall advertised heavily on Wednesday when the store opened. But the store didn't advertise that it was a better deal than the cinema hall. Only half of Americans who went shopping on New Year's Eve bought a brand new suit. The fact that there was a difference in prices between the two shows that malls can improve their price comparison advertisement. Advertising should also show the savings to the customer over just the suit. Also, a full length mirror would improve price comparisons, since nobody would be looking at their legs while shopping.<n><n>Input:The restaurant had 40 employees. The food at the restaurant was good. The price for the food was very reasonable. The employee paid $10 an hour. The price charged for the employee was $75 an hour. The total salary was $2,500 an week. The total food charge was $0.0040 an item. The total salary was the total amount the restaurant had.<n>Output: 2.15 * 10 = 0.0108<n>Subtracting 0.0108 from both sides of the equation, the final answer is 0.0040<n>The employee is paid $2,500 * $10 = 2500<n>The employee is paid<n>$1,500 * 2.15 * 40 = 2000<n>Subtracting 2500 from both sides of the expression, it comes out as $20.00<n>The employer paid $25,500 for his employee. The employer paid $25,100 for the employee's services.<n>The employer paid $2,500 per hour to his employee. The rate to be paid for the employee services is $75 an hour. Total income for the employer in 1997 was $150,000. Total salaries paid to the employer were $150,000.<n>Since each dollar provides 50 cents extra, employee salaries cost 100 times less than the food costs. Since the total sales of the restaurant was $250,000, the total payroll is $15,500<n>So, employee salaries cost $3.25 times less than the total food costs.<n>So, the total annual salary of the employee was $30,000<n>So, the amount of income earned by the employee was $65,000<n>So the total annual income of the employee was $100,000<n>Subtracting the total income from the total income for 1997, $65,000 comes out as

Choices:  A: determination B: upper hand C: superior D: higher position E: skill<n>Output:		 D is correct<n>An advantaged player could reach advantage position through three possible methods. An advantaged player gains an advantage by getting 2 (or more) candies and then either taking two or one candy to put it into a bag. An advantaged player also gains an advantage by getting 5 candies and using the 5 candies to pick up another and then taking the other candy that he picked up earlier to put it in another bag with the first one. And an advantaged player can gain an advantage either by getting 2 candies and putting one into a bag or 2 candies and picking up another and then putting the two candies into a bag (also 1 or 2 candies). Thus, all three methods of gaining advantage depend on the number of candies he has. A advantaged player who has four candies can reach an advantage if he picks the five candies, reaches two candies by picking a third candy or reaches two candies by getting the fifth one and uses the five candies to pick up a fourth one. The advantaged player only needs 4 candies and 4 candies to get 10 candies. This is the advantage position he gains when reaching advantage position.<n><n>Input:In this game, each of the following numbers are added together for a simple sum. The sum total of this number is displayed. Input: Sum total of 7 plus 5 = 7<n>Output: Total 7 + 5 = 7/5<n>Sum 7 * 5 + 5 = 35<n>So add 35 to 3 / 7 and take 3 / 35 to get 9 / 35. This gets the total of 7 minus 5 divided by 7. This gets the total 3 minus 5. Now add 25 to 3 / 35 and take 25 / 35 to get 25 minus 5. This gets the total 7 minus 5 plus 35 minus 7 minus 5 minus 10 * 21 = 7<n>Add 21 / 35 to 3/7 and take 3/7 / 35 to get 9/35. This gets 9/35 plus 35 or 42. Add 1 to 3 / 7 and get 3/7 / 35 which get the final 4 which will be 42. In sum total 42.<n>The total amount spent by these players is 42/7<n>So the total spent by Lawrence after his 8 hour workday would be: 42 / (8 + 7) = 42<n>Add up 42 to 8 / 7 * 7 and take 42 / 7 and you get 42/7<n><n>Input: How many candies does the player with the most cand

We learned that the easiest way to form these words is to first think of an initial word with the same initial letter as the final word. For example, if the initial letter is a K, it has to be used as the second word in the word. For example, K = {A,A}, and K = {B,B}, but in most cases we probably want A > B > B.<n><n>In class and at lunch, we were doing vocabulary test.

The correct answers were: A: 2:22:18, B: I am the Bread of Life, I am the Rock, I am the One who keeps you from drinking water and makes you sleep in the dust. C: 2:34:10, D: 13:23, E: I am the Word of God, The Word of Life. F: 1 John 4:18<n><n>In class our teacher asked us to tell the reader about how God created the world. The correct answer was: 1:13:42<n><n>In class we studied words that use both an A and an R, and also word pairs with a R and an R. Some of these words were:<n>2+2 = 4,<n>2+2 + 3 = 5,<n>4+3 +2 = 8,<n>7+5 +3 = 17.<n>(To see how to solve problems, look at the problem at work and use the solution).

What information do you think I should look for?<n><n>input : What is the best way to solve an equation?<n>output : What would be the best way for you to solve the equation? and what would be the worst?<n><n>In this case, I used an equation to find all of the answers. The best way is the one that produces the least confusion, because you are searching for the right answer. The worst way is the one that requires the least input and best output.<n><n>The best way is to use the simplest approach and go through the process until you find the right equation. You know where all of the variables would be based on the equation and the answers (I assume that most people would use a calculator). Then, by checking the variables and finding the best answer, you get the right answer.<n><n>The worst way is to just guess. Even if you know that the answer is going to be correct, you may not know how you got there and you may make mistakes.<n><n>The best (and worst) solution has some degree of guesswork. The right solution may be more complex than the right solution from the wrong solution, but may eventually lead to the right answer if the right answer is found.<n><n>In my example, the first approach is going to get you to the right answer. If you know the answer, then you can use only the information provided (if it is a question like "beavers build to block a river" then the beavers build a river dam). Therefore, if you know the answer, you can use only that answer. The problem then becomes determining the right answer, where the answer is not based on the equation.<n><n>The second approach is the one to avoid, because it requires more steps and uses more inputs and outputs, resulting in more confusion and possible mistakes.<n><n>The worst approach is going to the wrong answer. You have no idea about the question. You may guess some answer and get it right for that particular question, but that is about it, because you have no idea where the answer came from.<n><n>The best solution to problem 1 would be the best solution to problem 2. The second approach would be better because it does not require you to guess. However, if you know the right answer to problem 2, then the first approach will still get you to the right solution. That is,

We know that $n$ is prime, so we can solve for $n$ right away.<n>As $e$ is any number less than $n$, there is a chance that $e>n$ or $e<n$. As $n$ is prime and $e$ is prime, then at least one of the next 8 integers is not $e$. If $e<n$, then $e>n$ because the next 8 integers are $e$. This means that $e$ is prime and $n$ is not prime and thus $e>n$. Thus $e>n$ and there is an $e>n$ number at least $e>5$. If $e>n$ is less than $e$ and $3 < $n$, then $e$. If $3<n$, then $3<n$. If $e>3$ is less than $n$, $e$ is less than $c+1.$ If $c+1>n$, then $c+1>5$.<n>There are 2 ways to get $e$ less than $n$ and only one way to get $c+1<n$ and only one other way to get $e>3$. When $c+1>6$, that is $6<5$, so $n$ and $n+1$ are prime.<n>Note that for a number $n$, there are no $e>n$ solutions with $1$ less than $n$. If this is the case, then $n$ is not divisible by $1$ and $e$ is divisible by $2.<n>When $e>2$ and $c+1 < 6$, let $e=2$ and let $1 = 6. Notice that in all those circumstances there is a $e>n$ solution, thus $c+1<6

Choices:  A: short term B: crowd C: unpredictable D: frequent E: eternal<n>Output:		 The number of secular parties held per year has been going up since the dawn of secularism, which started in the 1950s. The average number of secular parties have increased from 40 for the first half of 1946 to 110 in 1967 (Figure 5). The average secular party has been falling steadily since then, and it is now only around 30. It is expected that secular parties will continue to fall in this direction.<n>It is generally accepted that secular parties are held more often when it is the beginning of a cycle. Thus, a secular party is held in the first 3 years of every cycle, and in the last 3 years it is held on a regular basis, so that the trend line of secular parties will not change even if the rate of secular party increases decreases.<n><n>Input: How often are "real-world" parties held?

It is thought that the rise from 7 to 40 is mainly due to the number of secular parties increased from around 40 to more than 50.<n><n>Input:How much money does America spend per year on foreign aid?<n>Output: It costs around $6 billion dollars per month, which corresponds to around one percent (1%) of the total money that America gives each and every month throughout the year.<n>It is estimated that as the global population increases, America will have to spend more and more on foreign aid in order to deal with the needs of its large population. Since many people are going to die during this period, the overall population growth can be considered to be positive. However, if the global population declines, then it is predicted that the number of foreign aid recipients will decrease.<n>If the overall population declines, then America will have to spend less on foreign aid.<n>Since the number of foreign aid receipts is decreasing, then American spending will become less. Hence, it can be seen that America’s foreign spending per year per capita will decrease as a percent of its total spending on overseas<n>(Figure 6)<n><n>Input:<n>Supp

How many candies will Corey's dad have if he takes away the candies the 2 of them have together? How many candies does Tapanga have if he takes away his other 6 candies?<n>Output: Let y = the total candy Corey has. y + 70 = the total candy Tapanga has.<n>Let x = the total number the candy Corey has. For the two of them, let x + (x + 70) = 80.<n>Combining like terms and subtracting, we get 2x x + 70 = 80<n>Subtracting both sides, we get x = 58<n>Dividting both sides by 2, y = <<29=29.8>>29, so Corey only has 29 candies. So the final answer is 29+290=580<n>That is the total amount Tapanga has.<n>Now let each of them take their candies. The y of a and c is the sum of the other 2 candies. So the total amount lost is the sum of the 6 candies. That leaves about 5 candies for each of them.<n>That leaves 80 for Corey to lose and tapanga to take back.<n>So the final answers totals 580 + 590 = 580 + 580 = 580<n>Then add together 580 + 580 and 580 + 580 and 580 = 580.<n><n>Input:You are studying to become a paramedic.

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Dan outfitted his house to run on the oldest heat source on Earth. What is the oldest heat source on Earth? Choices:  A: fire B: solar energy C: sun D: house E: coal or wood<n>Output:		 Dan used wood as his heat source and ran electricity from it.  The heat-producing capacity of the wood is 10kW, and the wood burning itself produces 17kW.  Thus the heat-producing capacity of this method is 17kW / 17kW = 10kW.<n>Thus the total area of Dan's house required heating the house on Earth is 17,000 sq ft.<n>Thus the power requirement would be 17,000 mW, or 17,000 = 10kW / 16,000 = 10mW<n>The area of Dan's house is thus 4,000 sq ft. = 4,000 square feet / 10mW = 4/3/3 = 1.5 km*3.5 m/3.5 km = 500 m<n>So the total running cost is 1.5m<n><n>Input: In a bar at a casino, a billier wants to buy a drink for $20. The billier does not pay for the bill. How is that possible?<n>Output: If the billier buys nothing from the house, that means that the bar is running on money.  That means that the bank is in business.  There is no bank failure.<n>To show that there is "money," you would also think that the billier is spending (using credit card or bank loan).  The billier is buying something from outside the casino.  If you use money, the billier spends money.  If you use credit, the billier borrows money.  This does not prove that there is money.  There is no money!  That would imply that there is a bank.  There is not a bank.  What is going on?  The casino is not going to allow the billier to go outside, nor will the casino loan money to the billier.  So the casino is bankrupt!  Not a problem!  What happens when the billier is unable to continue running the casino?  Does the money from the casino fund the billier as a new owner?<n>Output: We have a situation in which the billier is taking advantage of the casino and the casino taking advantage of him.  The casino is taking advantage of the billier, and the casino is using money to finance operations and build more casinos.  This happens in a casino.  At the end of the day, the billier is still the boss and the casino is not going to let him leave.  Thus the casino is bankrupt.

He found the store's weekly list on the shelf next to a stack of clean dishes. Then he filled his pail. How many cans of soda did he buy?<n>Subtracting the number of cans of soda needed to make a gallon of milk, we find we need 12 cans of soda to make a gallon of dairy.<n>Adding the number of cans of juice, we find we need 14 cans of juice to make a gallon of juice.<n>Subtracting two gallons of milk from that, we find we need 7.5 gallons of milk. So that means he needed 2.5 gallons of soda and 15.5 bottles of juice.<n>To get these things we have to divide by 8. The amount of time Lawrence would need each day to get 7.5 gallons of dairy is 8 hours.

It is obvious that each person would be hit in a straight line, since they would all be standing right next to the person they were going through the intersection when the collision occurred. What if the person they were trying to hit was standing in a crosswalking? The person would have to walk up onto the crosswalk so that they could be hit as opposed to walking towards the intersection and then being hit from behind. Therefore, the person hit would have to walk all the way around, even if they had a full block of space in front of them to avoid the person they were trying be hit by.<n><n>Input: A man found a box filled with $50, but he opened it instead of giving the money to the man.

For 12kg, the total weight is 132/5 = 6.25lbs. Now for 40kg, the total weight will be 4.25lbs. Therefore, the total weight will now be 4/50 = 11lbs<n>Therefore, the additional 11lbs will be 2/5 = 6.5lbs<n>Now 3/100 will give you your final answer.

Choices:  A: pressure B: death C: trying harder D: quitting E: winning or losing<n>Output:		James quit competing<n>Which of the following was most likely the reason for James' decision?<n>(Answer key)<n>A) Pressure<n>B) Death<n>C) Trying Harder<n>D) Quitting<n>Explanation:  A) Pressure in competitions is a stressful  pressure.  "To quit" means to quit and "I quit"  means that  you have to<n>quit.  James was feeling the pressures of competing. Therefore he decided to quit. B) Death – competition, like most activities,<n>toughens you up.  In  a competition, you do your best and sometimes you can go too far.  You need to slow down<n>sometimes if you  want to do well in a competition. D) Quitting – In the competition, it is a competitive<n>competition.  There are people out there  who would rather win. Therefore they will keep trying until<n>they<n>do. If James had not quit competing, he would have stayed too late and stayed up longer on<n>Saturday nights. E) Winning, no doubt, was on their mind.  When James had the<n>opportunity to quit<n>competing, he had to weigh the risks.  He considered quitting, but he knew he would be<n>better off<n>competing. If he went to bed, he could sleep off  the  stress and the pressure. Winning is<n>hard<n>to  resist and James did not want to take a risk of his body failing up and<n>giving<n>up because of the  stress of competing.  The  only  way that James could win was to<n>compete. F) Quitting –  Although quitting is never easy, James knew that quitting<n>is the best<n>thing  to do. If there was ever a time that he  needed to quit, the  competition  would<n>have<n>been it. Since there were people who  saw  him  quiting  as  the best thing to do in the<n>competition,<n>James  could  not  expect  anything  else.  Since he wanted  to go  to university  anyway, he  decided<n>to  give<n>up and  compete. G) Quitting –  James had  already decided to give up competing,<n>which was<n>the best thing he could do. When  he woke up on Saturday morning, he had  already<n>determined<n>his  plans  to quit.  At some point,  he would  quit  the

Example: Danny works long hours at a job. If he gets a raise, the new pay will only be 2 less hours a day, but he didn't want to work 2 less hours. So he went to the grocery store to buy a new day-timer. It was the best thing he could give his boss, so he was happy for himself. Plus he had 2 extra hours a day for the rest of the week. So he'd do 2/11 = 5 x 2 = 8 hours in extra. So he worked 5 hours on the extra day, or 7 hours overall in the extra day.

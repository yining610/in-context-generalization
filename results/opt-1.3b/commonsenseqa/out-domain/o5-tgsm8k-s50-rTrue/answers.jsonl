What is the highest amount that his parents or others could give him?\nOutput: In order to receive $3,000, the accountant must have the money prior to April 15, 2000 (if the bill is less than $25).\nIf the accountant was able to give $3,000 immediately but they did not have that cash, then they would still be able to receive the $3,000 tax credit but they would lose the interest deduction.  So the amount the accountant could give would depend on which tax brackets he is in:\n\u2022 The highest number of brackets.  The highest number of brackets is 5\n\u2022 The highest number that his parents or other people could give him.  The highest the number that any person could give the accountant is $500\n\u2022 If the taxpayer knows that they have to take a higher bracket but they are not currently in that bracket.  Their parents or other people could send $500 of their own money ($500 + $250) to the accountant.  If they are actually in a higher bracket than their parents or others, they could just pay the $3,000 upfront (if they had the cash) and save the interest deduction until April 15, 2000.\n\nInput: In the game Animal Crossing: New Leaf, you can purchase a new outfit for your character.

If each person answers in their own name, how many others did they forget to call?\n Outputs: He forgot to call them all!  He only called 7 people!\nSo all of the people at the party were called in for the phone book. The host called 35 people with names in a list. The list only contained 6 names, so the host had to call people twice if they forgot to call them.  He still only called 7 people!  (The last number is 37. The host called 6 of them twice.)

Five cups of uncooked instant ramen contains 2.4 calories per 1.5 cups of water. Which amount is greater?\nOutput: Only one cup has 3 calories per 1.5 pounds of water.

{"text": "John uses the toy store and buys a 2-amp adapter plate.  The total value of his power use is $20.  (2 watts x $1.80)\nSo the final answer was $20\n\nInput: The computer mouse cannot be plugged in the wall because it weighs too much.  What can be done to make the mouse more stable?  The most important suggestion was to attach a weight at one end of the mouse.  The mouse weight would be attached to a string tied to the wall opposite the wall of power.  But attaching the string at the opposite end created a problem: too much weight on either side of the mouse would prevent it from extending. For instance, hanging the weight one end would give one side a negative effect and the opposite side a positive effect.  When the mouse started to wiggle sideways, the user would need to pull it straight or wiggle it to get the correct movement.  Another approach is to attach a weight at the edge of the mouse allowing more room to maneuver.  However, when the user pulled it, the excess weight would cause friction and damage the mouse.\nOutput: There are a few different ways the wall can be made to be easier for the mouse to attach to: use electrical tape to hold the two wires together, install a second outlet on one side of the room, or create a hole in the floor under the desk to put the wires through.\nBut, a way to stabilize the mouse would be to set it on its end.  Because the handle would be touching the desk, the user would have less resistance to moving the mouse.  When that happened, the weight would slip over without causing friction or damage.\nOutput: The method of stabilizing the mouse is to place a piece of electrical tape under the bottom of the mouse to attach it to the surface.  If the mouse were hung on an end, it would not wiggle sideways.  However, attaching it at the edge would not wiggle it horizontally.  Therefore, the best way to be safe with the mouse was to center the mouse and not hang it on any edge.\n\nInput: Mary doesn't have enough room to store a set of kitchen knives.

To pay for the food, you can go to the store and get some meat. So you spend $7 for meat. So your total is $9 - $70, so you lose 10 because you don\u2019t want to give her anything else. So the total is $45.\nYour total now is $45.\nSo it is easier to give her this rather than buying a cake yourself.\nSo now you will have more money left.\n\nInput:Pablo decides he wants to study hard.

The second month, she buys one item for each child. The third month, she buys a treat for all children. The fourth month, she buys an item for a little girl who is having a bad day. The fifth month, she buys a thing for each child. The sixth month, she buys 5 items for each child.  Alice's first treat for each child gives Alice $1 of profit. The second treat for each child gives her $3 profit. The third treat for each child gives $6 profit. The fourth treat for each child gives the child $8 profit. The fifth treat for each child gives them $12 profit.  The sixth treat for the child gives them $16 profit.  Alice's second treat for each child gets her $4 profit.

The new books each cost $10 each.  He pays for three books for all six of his friends, so he gets three books for $25.00.  How many books does he have to buy for these three? What is the name of his class?\nOutput: He gives John's class three books = $25.  Assuming he buys three books for each student, he needs $50 to buy three books for his three students.\nSo if he had three books per student, then $50/3 = $20/3 = <<$20/3=15>>15 books.\nIf he bought one book for each student, and all books cost $20, then this would be equal to the cost of four books. Then if John's class could read all three books together, each student would cost $20.\nSo the final total for three books and three students, is $25/3 = $10/3 = <<$10/3=45>>45 books\nSo John's students spend about $40.\nSo now John's class has 45 books, which is equal to the cost of 50.\nSo a class of 50 students would require $45 in books for reading of 50 books each, and there are 45 books in the class.  John has $50 in the budget.\nSo the final score is 45/2 = $45/2 = $15.\nSo two students are $15 per book.  There will be five total books in the class.\nTotal - $15/75 = $10/75 = $15\nSo two students account for one half of John's budget.  Of course they don't count.\nTwo students account for the other half of John's budget, and so they account for the majority.\nTwo students account because 15 and 25 are both", "answer": "E: motel"}

How long would it take for the bird to cover a 40-40.2 inch radius when standing still?\nOutput: The circumference of the bird's wings is 45 inches for 0.02 seconds.  Then it covers the 40x40=120 inch radius in 1.8 seconds\nThe bird's radius is the maximum width of the wings, so the diameter is the width at the base of the wings divided by the length, so the radius divided by the length is the circumference. So the circumference is the distance that the wingspan is divided by the width. To find the answer, suppose that the wingspan of the bird is 40 inches. So the radius is 80 inches. And suppose the circle is made by wrapping the plane three times around. Then the perimeter would be 40x40.8 + 0.02 = 0.12 meters.\nNow, let\u2019s figure that the bird is standing still, so the radius is 60 inches, and the circumference is 120 inches. Then the plane has a radius of 60.12 cm. Then a circle of the radius 40.4 inches would cover it in 7.1 seconds\nSo the radius of the circle is 120 centimeters and the circumference is 120. If the same circle was stretched over the same 40\u00d740.2 inch area and the radius was 120.5 cm, it would take 9.1 seconds\nSo it took 9.1 s to cover the perimeter, but it took 10.2 s to cover it in a straight line.  So the time to do the circular half was about 1.9 seconds\n\nInput: the cook has just made several steaks. She has six steaks to cook, each steak weighed 10 pounds.

He needs to sell at least 3 of them at a certain price. The house contains $10,000 in stuff that he wants to sell at a higher price. He has a yard sale for $3000. He has a friend to sell all of his stuff at a very low price. How much money should he be earning from that yard sale???\nOutput: He will have made $10,000 off of the sale of his stuff if at least 3% of the sales were at a higher price than that lawn sale. But if all of his stuff sold for the same price as the lawn sale, he would only have earned $1000 of this total $10,000 sales.\nSo even though $3000/3% = $1000, the actual sale, where the money earned by the yard sale was $3000/3%, would be $3000/$3=$1000\nSo the final answer will be $15,000/3% = $15,000/$3=$3000\n\nInput:The two people who were playing pool bought two balls at a store because they want to play.

Therefore, he decided to use the following ingredients: chicken thighs, frozen vegetables, carrots, and celery. He made 3 sandwiches. If he uses 1/3 of each ingredient to make a sandwich, how does the chef use three separate ingredients to make 3 servings?\nOutput:Each chicken thigh + 1 celery + 2 carrots = <<1/3+1/3=3>>3 = 3 servings sandwich total\nEach chicken thigh + 1 chopped carrot + 2 celery = {1/3+2/2=1/3+1} = 6 servings total\nSince each piece of chicken thigh has twice the amount of vegetables as an ingredients to make a sandwich, it will provide more veggies to the total serving than the ingredients to make a sandwich. Therefore, it will provide 6 servings.\nTherefore, the extra 6 servings of the chicken will provide 12 servings.\nSince the extra extra servings will provide 12 servings, then the extra extra servings will each provide 20 servings.\nThus, the extra double servings will provide 40 servings\n\n inputs:The first group of three people had to decide which college they wanted to attend.

For example: There is no male in the class. Let\u2019s split the class into groups of 5. Let\u2019s assign the males 2 girls with and the females 1 boy with. Now, how difficult is it to divide the genders into groups, based on numbers from 1 to 10?\nOutput: Let\u2019s split them into 1 male and 2 female groups. The numbers from 1 to 5 have 5 males. Let\u2019s get an even number. The group will have 2 1 to 12 12, the order is male. So we can divide the whole group by 10. There are 10 boys and 10 girls. If you divided this group by 10, we got 5, 2 men and the other two females.\nSo let\u2019s take the whole male section and divide the numbers. Let\u2019s go to the girls. A man will have 5 girl. There will be 4 females, the order is female. So 5 boys, 2 girls. So 4 girl, 3 men. So the girl has 1 boy, 2 men. So the boy has 1 girl, 3 men. But let\u2019s divide the whole boy section of the class by 1, 10, 2 males. It\u2019s 11 boys, 2 females. There is 10 boys, 2 girls, 10 1 to 5, the order is 1 to 12 12, so that\u2019s how you can divide the whole boy section.\nSo how did I divide the people into groups. With the order of the numbers?\nSo 2 girls, 3 boys, 11 girls, 10 boys, 2 females, male.\nAnd now, the boy section. We\u2019re back to 4 girls, 3 males. We can divide by 10. There are 11 boys, 2 girls, 5 boys, 2 females, 2 males. So we have 11 men in groups of 10, it\u2019s the same as the original example.\nNow to the girl section. We have 10 girls, 2 males.

How many pieces would Harry have had in his pocket now but still would have been able to use a small amount of the material to write a letter to the editor?\nOutput:If Harry still could have gone on after getting his letter to the editor, then he still would have had the book.\nSo Harry had 8 out of 12 of the 12 pieces of the box. Therefore, he needed 3 more pieces. If he got his letter and kept it on the desk, he could have filled up the rest of the box.\nThe extra 3 pieces could easily have been had by asking the students to bring some home in their lunchboxes. However, this would be difficult. However, he needs to get some other books, so he will most likely need a few more books. Therefore, after the third day, he will need 12 out of the 13 pieces.\n\nInput:Pete was looking for a way to earn a bit more cash after finishing his internship. On a lunch break, he found an ad in a newspaper asking for help writing a book review. While writing, he realized that reading a book was so much easier, especially while sitting in a car all day. Pete went home and thought about it. Finally, he said he would write a review but only on his computer so that he could finish it at night.\nHis dad told him he should not do that. He asked Pete to find all the necessary book reviews. Of the reviews he did, he selected two books to begin. Then he looked for books to write for the newspaper. After checking each review for the name of a movie or book and using that in the paper for review, he decided the reviews might not be correct because the titles would not be the book title. So he will have to work on making sure that every review is right.\nOn the next day, Pete took the reviews back to the newspaper. After reading the reviews", "answer": "A: school"}

During his experiment, Frank observed that bacteria were producing some gases. His curiosity got the best of him and he began to research this reaction more. When he researched more, he discovered that bacteria were able to convert ammonia into nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide via an extremely simple process.\nAfter researching this, the scientist made a simple device called a carburizer. This device is meant to convert ammonia into nitric oxide and carbon dioxide. The carburizer works by heating up a small amount of water. As the water heats up, it reacts with the bacteria and creates nitrous oxide. Carbon dioxide is also generated. The carburizer can also take acetylene gas and convert it into argon.\nThe scientist made several types of carburizers. One type of carburizer uses a carbon nanotube (CNT) and three types use a silver electrode. The CNT is a material made solely from atoms of carbon. The silver electrodes are silver spheres and the silicon has six different angles. The end result of using these carburizers is the same. One CNT in the top area, three nanotubes at the bottom, and one silica-based electrode beneath. Each CNT has only one function. It is only active in the nitrogen-nitrogen atmosphere and will not work when exposed to oxygen. Carbon nanotubes and silver electrodes work best when there is a small amount of nitrogen. Another version of the carburizer uses a metal bar electrode and silver balls. The silver balls are small objects that make the reactions happen. The reaction can be monitored via computer. The carburizer also makes an electric generator. This is a type of carburizer that will allow the carburizer to produce electricity. It will work best in extremely low pressure.

He can then calculate how long it would cost to build each window and other building.  He can then use those estimates to determine that it will take the architect an extra week to do something he\u2019s willing to do now because he has to use the wrong calculator.  So he tells the engineer to add a few days on each one.  The engineer then asks him:  \"Which of these adds up to 50 hours a week and therefore costs 50 hours?\"  The architect points to his house.  The engineer then tells the architect that in this case, it costs 50 hours.  Therefore, the engineer is now charged with the work.  The architect then asks:  \"Which of the engineer\u2019s estimates adds up to the whole day so that it costs the whole day?\"  The engineer can choose which estimate the architect chooses and the architect then adds 100 hours.

For example, 1 + 2 is either 0 or 2, 1 + 3 is either 3 or 4, 2 + 4 is either 4 or 8, and 1 + 9 is either 4 or 12. Choose an integer with the same number of positive digits as the square root of the problem. The integer can include any multiple of 3. The integer can be no longer than 7, cannot include an odd integer, or contain only 1 or 2. After you have chosen an integer, find the minimum of the number of positive digits divided by the integer. This can be done with a single step of addition. If the number of positive digits in the integer is greater than the number of positive digits of the problem, you need to do the remainder rule. If two integers are included in the number, the first one can add to the second one and the second one can subtract from the first one.  This integer can then include any multiple of 3 to make a 4. After you have chosen your integer, use your second step of addition. If there are more positive integers than the number you have chosen, use the remainder rule again. If there are not more positive integers, choose the integer of highest addition.\n\nInput: A scientist has 60 cells. How many of these 60 cells have positive anions?

Therefore, they made $1800 from butter sales in the year.\nBecause they make such a lot of money from butter sales, the total income per week exceeds $50 with the help of butter. So next they buy more butter and sell it for an extra $600 per week. The total income per month is still $1800.\nSo the total income per week for the butter business in 2014 was $800 per month.

Answer the following questions: What is he hoping to learn? Why would he want to learn it? Is it helpful to him? How much did he learn? What is the problem with learning this thing, and what is the solution?\nOutput: His day of learning was a success.     What he learned was that he was not happy in his  family.  No matter how much he worked or how many books he read, the fact remains that his\nmother still beat him.  He saw that as bad behavior.   His mother wanted him to learn to stop  beating his sister and be a good brother; however,\nhe wanted to be normal.  There are problems with this statement, but I will get to that after a few minutes.  His sister is always\nwanted to be the \u201calpha\u201d in the family, and he wanted to be normal.\nNo matter how many books he read or how many ways he tried and how many chores he was  supposed to be doing, his\nmother was still always beating him.  He wanted to stop it.  He was never  happy, and his sister never was.  He\nrealized that he was not good enough in his family and wanted to change.  He did not want to do well at school and  become a\nsuccessful person in the future unless he changed.  His mother could see it, but she did not want to accept that\nhe could not.   He learned that he had to.  He learned that he was never acceptable to his mother and he had to  get better at something.\nThe things the child says and does can make\na very big difference how far a child will learn. This is very true in school.  The child cannot possibly learn what he needs to learn if\nhe does not take an active role in learning.  Children are not  expected to sit in class and listen and do what is expected by his\nteachers.

To get the word count up, she chose to write an additional chapter every couple hours. After writing three hundred and fifty words in the first hour and a half, it was time to start writing chapters two and three.\nEach chapter took more than two hours to write. After writing five chapters, she decided not to read the chapter. After an hour and a half reading just one chapter, she decided that she wanted to complete the book before she went to sleep.

Before she left, she offered him 4 test strips. If he took two strips from each, the teacher would find out if the boy is a good student. The boy was given 3 stickers, each sticker indicating a good or bad test. If he took 3, the teacher would mark him as a good student. If he took 3+2, the teacher would mark her student as a good student. The result of the test was: Student A is a good student. Student B is a bad student. Student C is an average student. What are the results?\nOutput: After taking the test, the boy will get 1 sticker + 1 mark = 3 - 2 to make a total of 4 + 3 = 9.\nSo if this teacher had only been kind enough to speak to the boy after taking the test, he would have gotten 6 or 7 stickers.\nSo 5 or 7 stickers for 10 tests = 5 or 7 tests x (6/6=9) x (2/2=6) x (9/9=9) = 12 tests, or about $200.\nSo the final result is 12\n\nInputs: I love it when a boy comes to school and shows me his homework.

Teacher is forced to retire 3. Teacher never becomes a teacher again 4. Teacher does not graduate 5. Teacher becomes a doctor\nSo the final answer would be 2\n\nInput: If the teacher is a new teacher then he or she is usually not prepared for the first few lessons. Some children show interest in learning while others are lazy. Teachers get to pick their classes which helps but many are assigned a class they are not comfortable in. If a teacher is not feeling well it is easier for them to go to another class. Teachers have a lot of meetings and sometimes many are out on the floor. Teachers are expected to do a lot of work outside of class, take their kids to school on time and go home on time. Teachers are often not paid what they are worth because they have to work hard to keep their teaching jobs. Teachers also come out of retirement to teach but many times they do not want to teach.\n\nInput: Teacher's son has decided to stay home and learn. He plans to study French. The teacher can\u2019t afford to pay the son to learn the language. So how old is the son to decide to stay home and learn? How old is a new teacher to decide to keep their job?\nOutput: The son can stay home for up to a week before the teacher decides to fire a teacher.\nThe teacher could only afford to pay the son for a week if he was not allowed to stay home for more than that.\nIf the teacher\u2019s son was allowed to stay for more than a week, he would make more money to stay at home.\nIf the teacher was fired and she could not pay her son to stay (in which case she could stay home), she would need to find a new job and find a way to afford to pay her son to stay with her.\nIf the teacher is forced to keep her job (as is the case in Australia or Spain), she might think about moving to another state and start a new one over again, but this is expensive and hard.\nSo the final average age is 32 years old for teachers (or more), which is slightly below the average age of all Australian teachers, 35 years old.\n\nOutput: Which is the worst outcome?

This is a large investment. He thinks about how much he wants to spend but he does not want the car to be a burden. He asks his wife to pay for it and promises to pay back when it is finished. Over the next one year, the husband buys another car, then another, then another, until he spends his savings on a house. When the house is finished, he thinks back and realizes that he would not have spent that much if the car had been a gift from a friend, rather than him having to buy it for his own personal use. So, the wife pays for the house and puts the money away. When the car finishes, the wife asks the husband to pay for it. How many cars does the husband own?\nOutput: The marriage is happy, but his financial planning over the years has been good enough to make him feel that he has done a good deed for his wife.\nThe original BMW was the best car in the BMW shop. No one wants any of the other cars, because they are all too big for their cars and too expensive.\nSo the final message is to invest in a car that you do not need, that will not be a burden, that you will enjoy.\n\nInput: Three men are about to go into a restaurant.

Let\u2019s say each person knows every trick. How long does he have to keep every trick in his deck and on the board to keep his total cards in the deck equal to 3?\nOutput: Everytime the judge reveals the card number the person with card numbered 1 starts his turn. The person with card numbered 3 begins his turn. The person having card numbered 1 on his third turn can see card numbered 3. When the person with card numbered 3 is shown card numbered 2, he can see this card. So it is better for the person having the card numbered 3 at the same time that the person who has card numbered 1 on his first turn to keep trick card no. 1 on the board. Then the second time the person with card numbered 2 has the chance to see a card no. 2 but that second person can only see card no. 1 on his turn so he can see card numbered 2 on the next person\u2019s turn which is on the middle of the board before it moves to the side of the board.

The total cost is $100\nSo the total cost is $100/20 = $100\nHow many hours does it take to film one movie? So the total cost is $75\nSo the total cost of $75 / 2 = $75\nHow many movies does it take to film? The total cost is 150/20 = 150 / 20 = 75 movies\nSo the total cost for all 75 movies would be $750\nSo the total cost with the $150 was $750\nSo the final total cost is $750\nHow many movies does the studio put out per year? The total cost is 750 / 100 = 750 movies/year. So the total cost for the studio is 750 movies. The company makes $75 from each movie, and the studio makes $525.

If her salary is $18,000 and her annual vacation is 8 days, what is her total work time paid for?\nOutput: Her salary is 18,000 and she gets 8 days of annual vacation.\nTherefore her total paid time is 40h, which is 80 minutes per work day, which will take 80h*28.5s = 4961 hours per year, which is 4961 hours divided by 8 days = 496 hours per year, which equals $54/hour.\nTherefore a full time salary of $18,000 is divided by 496 = $10,840, which equals $1,600 per year, which is less than $4 per hour paid. So the teacher's actual income is $4904, which is less than the full time salary of $36,800 or about $0.35 per hour.\nTherefore her total income is $0.35 per year (i*18,000)/(36,800) / 400 = 20%.\nIn other words, her total income is $20.10 or $0.60 per hour, which is almost 1%, which is the lower bound of the boundless rate of pay.\nTherefore her total salary is $20.10. Because it is less than $4/hour, her total salary is less than $20,000 and she is paid less than $24,000.\nTherefore she has been paid less than $24000 and her total income is less than $24,080.\nTherefore the teacher is underpaid and not an adequate teacher.\n\nInput: In the United States, the average salary for computer programmers working for businesses is $90,000.

If you need a reference you can calculate this by using the difference in the dividend yield vs. total market price. To find the yield add in the dividends on your stocks from the beginning of the year to now and then subtract the present value of that dividend from the present value of the present price of your stock in your hand. So if you buy 1 share for $100.00 then you have 1 - $100.00 = $5.00 dividend on your stock. Now you can subtract $5.00 = $50.00 and the present value of that $50 dividend from the present value your price of the stock you have in your hand. The value in your hand now will be 50/1 - $50 - $75 = $75 and thus your total market return is %/$75.50. If you need a formula for calculating the dividend yield you can use the following formula to find the value and the number in brackets:\nDividend Yield - Total Market Price < $100.00 < $100.50 < $100.75 < $100.95 < $100.95\nOutput: The market value of your stock now is $75\n\nInput:What does the word \u201cgullible\u201d mean?\nOutput: The answer is that gullible people are able to be deceived into falling prey to an enemy, but they are not able to prevent themselves from falling prey to other enemies.\n\nInput:How many days does it take for the average person to sleep?\nOutput:The average person can dream for only 10.5 hours per day.

After 5 years, the businesses will pay $14,000. The business owners will receive a refund of the taxes.\nInput: B = $450 / 5 years = <<$450 / 5 years = $14,000>>14,000 dollars\nA business should be paying a tax rate that is 1/12 of what the tax rate is now. This will bring the tax rate down to $10\nOutput: $40\nA business that has $42,000 worth of goods and $22,000 worth of services must have $42,000 of goods and $44,000 of services to pay $45 for taxes per dollar of goods & services\nA business with $42,000 worth in goods and $20,000 in services has $42,000 of services and $20,000 worth of goods so their tax rate is $36 per dollar of goods & goods\nTo put in math terms, the business owner has $20 per $20 of services. Therefore, to pay $45 for their entire business, the business owner has to have $5600 worth of goods!\nSo it makes sense that the business owner only pays $36 for the entire business since each dollar of goods is only $20. At $6 per $20 services the business owner has $10,000. The business owner also receives a $14,000 backrefund from the city\nSo by purchasing only $5600 worth of services, the business owner will pay $4,000 for every dollar of goods\n\nInput: If a business buys food for $5.00 each day, how much does the business eat for $5.00 during the month?

If he takes his son to the store and buys the child suit for $25, how much will the boy pay?\nOutput: Assuming 5 minutes, the boy pays $25 = <<20/5=125>>125 each to bring his son to the store.\nSo the final solution is 125/5 = <<20/5+2=250 >>250 each.\nThe boy in red and the boy in blue go to the store and buy new clothes for their other children too.\nSince he has already bought the clothes for his son, the boy in red and the boys friend are going to the store to buy new clothes for all the children.\nTherefore, in the total, the boy in red will pay $250/5 = <<20-10 =75>>75 the clothes for his son.\n\nInput:The teacher needs to buy a gift for a student. Each student can have one gift and each teacher also has one gift. On Friday the student will go to the children's department at the store and spend $17.

On that Friday, the student will spend $10 on 1 gift for 15 students, and $3 each for the rest of them. The student also has a $3 spending allowance. How much does the teacher spend when they go to the store on Friday?\nOutput: The teacher will spend $10 on 15 gifts; $3 each for the 15 gifts, so $50 = <<20-3=50>>50 each\nSo if the teacher would have spent $50/5 on each gift, his total spent would have been $50/5 * 1 = $50.50\n\nInput:The school board members want to give each of their teachers a personal day.

The baby boy does not feel the need to imitate his father in any way. What do you think of this situation?\nInput: I have a 4 month old baby. As an incentive for obedience, I want to give him a stuffed toy in which to hide. I would like him to be able to play with the toy independently of me.

I could teach him not to take the toy unless he wants to play with it and I'll put his toys in his \"mama\" and \"dada\" baskets or in his \"big brother\" basket for awhile.

However, the idea that Inception suggests here is that the **action,** the **inception**, the **project** (the *narrative* of the actual dream), actually took place. It happens in Inception, so it should be the **name** of the film that is important. So, the question becomes not the meaning of the word **Inception**, but the **name** of a film?\nThe first two sentences I wrote give a short idea of how important this film is to me:** A: The film is what dreams, **N.I.F.** **A**: **the name****, **a**: **I**, **N.I**, **the** **f**: **f**, **N.O**: **no** **O**: **oh** **I'': **no** / **I''O**: **oh,** *the** film. **N.E.T.A**: **not** **N.I.**  So the question becomes not **Why** but **Whynot**?

{"text": "Compassionate thoughful is being.\nA humane and compassionate people are able to make intelligent choices, as they have the best possible chance to avoid problems.  Good behavior (with or without compassion) is based on good choice.  People are aware of the good or bad effects of their choices.  Choices are made from a better position since they have the moral right to choose.  People can be honest, fair, or considerate.  A good person is able to choose a moral course of action that leads to the best possible outcome.  Good people can be patient and kind.\nPractical compassion includes the ability to do the right thing. Compassionate people should help others, especially when the suffering of others is not their fault and is not worth making them regret.  Compassionate people should not harm people who do not harm others.  Compassionate behavior, both positive and negative, is often the cause of success.  Compassionate persons are active participants in their affairs, actively shaping the present and the future.\nCompassionate people should focus on themselves and their needs.  They should not cause further suffering; they should do the best possible to avoid causing any more suffering.  The ability to make conscious choices has been given to compassionated persons.  Conscious choices are more difficult than non-conscious choices.\nIn a way, compassionate people are aware that choices have consequences.  However, this awareness is a great aid to understanding how a person might cause more suffering, because the compassion is strong enough that they can see this before they act.  That is, the compassion gives the right thinking to cause fewer and fewer choices to cause more suffering.\nFinally, compassionate people can do things for others in small ways that do not detract from their own life and the lives of others.  Compassion may or may not be a very pleasant feeling.  There may be an initial reluctance to take action because they feel the pain of others would outweigh the small benefit.  When courage and a willingness to feel (which are very important to doing acts toward others) overcome this initial reluctance, the compassionate person will make the choice.\n\nInput: In order to build a house in two weeks, how many blocks would it be?\nOutput: How fast could you build a house in two days?\nIf you took one month to build a house, it would take you at most 2 weeks to build it in two days.\nSo the final question is how fast could you build a 50", "answer": "D: kind"}

How much of a percentage of the maximum value can he give away?\nOutput: After giving away a quarter of his total money, he will be left with $1000 which leaves.989898 for him to spend.\nHe would probably spend $8500\nSo the final answer in dollars per % of maximum value was $852.98 = 447.48 %\nSince it costs.989898 to buy a car, and a quarter of $3200 = $2160, he gets only $741.48\nSo the final answer cannot be 447.48 %; it is less than 447% ($741.48 -.989898) = 32 % less than before. It therefore is less than $4152\nSo he got the maximum value from his car; 447.48 %.\n\nInput:  How much water would it take to fill the biggest bathtub in the world?\nOutput: The biggest bathtub was 10 feet wide and 6 feet deep.

He needs to buy a candy stick to eat with his candy. The store sells 100 candy sticks. The price is $1.00. There are two ways to get the candy stick. If the customer eats the candy piece which comes on top of the candy they paid for, they will get a FREE candy stick. If the candy came in the bottom of the package, they will get an extra stick which costs $.10. So the customer only pays for 20 pieces. The customer would get four cents of candy because the candy came in the top of the package. On the other hand, if the customer bought the candy stick that came on the bottom of the package they would also get 4 cents. The customer would receive 20 cents, plus the 4 cents which they paid, for the remaining 80 cents of candy. How much would the total cost of candy, now $2.50, become with taking out the free candy stick?\nOutput: The customer only pays for 80 cents, so $2.50 + 90 cents = $2.70\n\nInput: If you are at the store, you are very", "answer": "E: anger"}

The accountant sends 10 checks to each of his clients. For each check he receives, the accountant gives his client $50. From the total amount of money he received, how much should the accountant give each client?\nOutput: From 50 to 0 equals $50.  He gave all clients 50 from the top total of 2.5 million.\nSo the final guess of 2,500,000 is incorrect since it includes 2.5 million from his client's checks\n\nInput: The baker bought 50 loaves of bread for $15. When he received them, he sliced 10 of them and left the rest whole. Later, the baker thought to look at his loafs of bread to see how many slices he had left and realized that he would have needed to sell 2 dozen of each to make the price equal. The baker then purchased 6 loaves of bread that cost him $15. He also purchased $7 worth of milk from a local supermarket. How many dollars did the baker spend after he made the calculation?\nOutput: After the baker made the calculated calculation, 3 loaves of bread cost him $15. The baker spent $14.75, which was 5.4 times the total cost of 10 loaves of bread. As a result, he ended up spending $17, which is 5.4 times the cost of the 6 loaves of bread. Since $17 is 5.4 * 10 = $4.00 per loaf, the baker would be out of money immediately after paying $7 for milk\nSo he spent $17 which is 5.4 * 4 = $5.00 as well\nSo the final guess was $15.75\n\nInput: The bakers are instructed to make a cake made of cream cheese frosting, sprinkles and candy sprinkles. The baker can make the cake from scratch or buy it. The cream cheese frosting costs an additional $12 and the sprinkles cost an additional $28. The baker chooses the cream cheese cake, which will cost him $40. The baker says that he needs the sprinkles to make the cake last so $28.00 will have to be spent when making the cake. How much money is the baker going to need to buy all of the sprinkles when he purchases the cake?\nOutput: $28", "answer": "D: spend money"}

Therefore, solving the third problem would be the hardest problem you pick.\nSo it can be seen that solving the first [1] and second [2] problems is the toughest problem in the class.\nIf they all choose the same solution as they have been before, then it will not be the toughest problem they choose. They will give all 5 possible solutions the same amount of points. The teacher will give 5 out of 10 points because they are all able to give an answer that is correct for at least 1 correct answer.

You have $300 and decided to invest it in a mutual fund which will give you a guaranteed return of 12% on its initial investment. You have $1000 and decide to invest it in a fund with a guaranteed return of 5% on its initial investment and an additional 3.5% on any additional investment you make in the fund. The total return on your investment is $1850, so at an annual return of 7% you will have a total return of $12.50, or a return of 12% on your investment in 5 years. Now your goal is to find a fund with a 10% return, you have $2500 to invest, and find another way to make 11% per year with this new fund. So after working out the 11% rate you should be able to find one fund that gives 8%, you have $2750 to invest for the 10% return. It takes $1800 to find another company that gives 8%.

For every month he did go to college, he gained $50.\nSo if John has 5 months left in school, he loses $2000 in benefits.  If he has 6 months left in school, all his benefits increase with $5000 in annual savings added to his bank account.  If he had 3 months left in school, his monthly payments are $1500.  If he had 1 month left in school and has the same savings as before, it would cost him $1150 to retire at 55.\nSo after 5 months of no college, his yearly salary increases with $5000 in savings added to his bank statement.  After 6 months of no school, his yearly salary increases by $10000.  After 9 months of no school, it increases by $10000.\nIf John starts college now and lasts till fall 2019, he gives up no benefits but earns $130000 each year in salary.\nIf he starts school in January 2019 and lasts till December 2019, he gives up his college benefits but earns $13.50000 per year in salary.\n\nInput: An accountant\u2019s salary is $55.00 a day, so if he only makes $50.00 a month, how much could he earn in the next 10 years?\nOutput: An accountant\u2019sc salary is $55.

The buyer likes the house, has an $18,000 down payment and plans to use their loan and home equity to make the down payment and pay as much as possible in interest.  The buyer can either put a 15% down payment to start the process or buy the house without a down payment.  If she buys the house with a 6% down payment, what is the home value?\nOutput: Since the buyer will put $18,000 down and can make $18,000 in interest per year, she needs the following to make the down payment: <<18,000/6=25>>25 down payment each month.\nIf she only makes $18,000 per year in interest, she only has $12,250 in savings per month.  If she only makes $17,000 in income, she only has $7,250 in savings per day.  So the home value would be $12,250 divided by $12,250 in monthly house payment equals $12,250.\nSo the homeowner is $120 per day in debt.  The down payment is $0 because she doesn\u2019t need the $18,000.  The house is $1,200, but cost the buyer $600 to buy. (the cost of the furniture alone is $600) Total she still has to make the down payment of $60 per day.  So she will only have $300 per day to cover the interest costs on her loan.  Now she has the ability to only repay $600 per day.  Therefore, her savings will only be $300 per day.  Therefore the home value will be $1,200 divided by $600 per day equals $120.\nSo the homeowner won\u2019t be able to pay $1,200 per day on the mortgage and still make enough to pay that interest, since she will have an extra $300 per day in savings.  Therefore the house will cost the homeowner $1,200 divided to be $120.  The $120 is the total mortgage payment divided by the amount of interest paid.\nSo the homeowner will have a small emergency fund and will be able to live without her savings each month.\nSo the homeowner wins by making $3,300 in income, and the sale of the house will result in $2,", "answer": "B: frustration"}

That would take 1 cup - 15/15 = <<15/15=15>>15 cups per coffee\nYour total coffee requirement = 12 cups. (15/15 + 15/10 = 45/35 = 45/35)\nSo the total cup requirement = 45 cups. (12 + 12 + 45 = 75)\nSince the coffee cup is not a square, the cup is 1 cup in diameter. Thus, the difference in cup sizes - 45 - 45 = <<45/45=9>>9 cups\nBecause the number of cups required is 45, there must be 45 cups on the table at once. So the total number of cups necessary is 81.\nSince the number is 81, there cannot be no other cup on the table (5)\nso there is one cup on the table, at one time (1 + 1 = 1)\nSo the total number of cups on the table = 81\n\nInput:The man lives in a high-rise with his partner and two children.

Select at least 2 questions below.\n\nInput: If the first 3 ingredients of the cake are flour, milk and eggs, how many eggs will a cake make?\nOutput: Assuming the first 3 ingredients are flour, milk and egg, then the top 3 things that will be left in the cake are flour, egg and milk / flour, milk and egg. This will make one cake. The total egg count for 1 cake is = ((1 + 1) / 3 = 1 + 1) + 1 to make 1 egg, 3 eggs + (1 + 1) = 2 eggs and the total milk count for a cake is = ((1) - (3) + (3) + (1)) = 9.5 Milk. That\u2019s 1.5 milk x 2 cakes. This will yield 3 cakes, so they cost $2.5/3 = 3.25 milk. Milk costs $2.25 / 3 = $2.25/3 for one cake.\nSo to make the total cost of 3 cakes, the total number of cakes that were sold was x*3 = $5 = $2.25, and the number of cakes left over was x*3, so 3 cakes were left.\nSo the total cost of 3 = 5*3 = 20.25\nSo the final answer was $20 plus $2.25 = 20\n\nInput: On the same day, Michael went to get coffee and a piece of toast, but left his wallet at school.

How much did she pay each of her four sharers?\nOutput: Two people shared the $35 bag of chips and the $35 bag of sugar free vanilla chips. So the total cost of the four sharers was $34. She paid them $30 for each bag.\nSo the total cost of the bag of chips and sugar free vanilla was $34. Since her four sharers split the remaining $20 between them, she took $20/4 = $<<20/4=12>>12.50 from the total.\nSo she took $20/12 = <<20/12=30>>30 chips and $10/12 = $<<10/12=10>>10 bags of chips.\nSo the total price of the bag of chips was $34.50.

If not, any good reason why? \u201c First the guy said no, now he says yes. How many sales did the second bartender do?\nOutput: The first guy sells 6 drinks, because 6 drinks is the maximum number a customer would buy so he said no more drinks for him. The second bartender does not do any more work for him.\nThe third bartender, however, tells him to do three more drinks and when the third bartender hands him a shot glass to fill, he says \u201coh, excuse me\u201d but in case the second bartender tries saying, \u201cyou already did that\u201d the manager is prepared and tells him to serve more drinks and when the second bartender fills the second glass, asks him, \u201cdid you do more?\u201d\nNow it turns out that the second bartender gave a shot glass, not a glass. So his total sales for the day was 2 shots + 1 glass = 3 sales and the number of customers he had is 6. Therefore, his total number of sales for the day is 6/6 =<<6+1^2>>6.\nSo the final number of sales he sold is 3/6 =<<6/6=18>>18\n\nInput: The teacher has a test of 200 of the students in her class.

Alice wants to get Bob to work on the puzzle with her; he says he doesn\u2019t want to do the puzzle. Suppose only 6 puzzles are in the book. If Alice has four puzzles she has to do one step for each remaining puzzle; and if she has six puzzles, she has to do one more step for each remaining puzzle. If all puzzles are in the book, how many steps must Alice do?\nOutput: The puzzle with two steps is three steps in, which is the total number of steps needed to complete both puzzles.\nSo we want Alice to do one step for every remaining puzzle in the book, which is three steps.\nSince there are only five puzzles in the book and there are only six steps needed by Alice, that gives us 10 steps needed by Alice, which gives us 10 steps.\nSo Alice must do 10 steps.\nSo if Alice has six puzzles and has the book with 400 pages, there are 10 steps needed for each of these six solutions.\nSo we want to be sure that Alice has a total of 12 steps and we don't want that number to be higher. How many additional steps are needed?\nOutput: Since there are only six puzzles in the book we don't need that many steps, so in this case we have 12 steps.\nSo now we need to figure out how many additional steps we need. How many steps would it take for Alice to complete the remaining puzzles in the book.\nOutput: If there are 100 puzzles in the book then the necessary steps are 200. So we need 2 steps, 2 steps, 2 steps and 2 steps for each puzzle because there are 100 puzzles.\nSince the book has 400 pages, it takes 400 steps for all 400 puzzles. Therefore we have to figure out how many steps are needed to finish the remaining puzzles in the 400 pages book.\nOutput:\n\nInput: A plane carrying two people crashes after takeoff.

Each round begins with an "X" on the X-axis and "Y" on the Y-axis. When the two boards intersect, they are checked for a match (i.e., one X-board and one Y-board meet.) You must play around both boards. A player may move either the X or Y board forward, backward or sideways to make check on the board. The "X" and "Y" in check are the same on the two boards. To make sure that you are playing around not one but two boards, you begin each check with the "X" or "Y" board, making sure you have a clear chance to move the check around. As one board is checked for a match, you move the other back and forth. If you play around the "X" or the "Y", you can win a move by "playing the check down". If you move one board backward, you have to move the board forward again (this means a reverse check). If you make the check on the "Y" board, you are "played the check down". If your opponent plays the check down, they win a move. If you move the X boards back and forth, you must play another check from the previous board. At the end of the game, the player with the most wins.<n>Input: In a game of checkers you can play around two boards and can win in five moves or less. You are allowed to play the check from the other board back to the first board, and the check on the second board to the first board. You may play the check down if your opponent plays the check up. If the player plays the check up, the player loses a move.

Answer: Take a photo of the area of the image and take the area of that photo, with the number of pixels in the image. This results in a vector. Print out that vector and count the number of pixels. This result is a scalar. Print it out a second time and it's a scalar with the same value as the photo. But it will never equal 0 because it contains 0 pixels. In the second process it's already multiplied by an integer which has been scaled. The answer is to have a second process where you count each pixel and keep track of what you are multiplying it with. The answer is to do the following: Use the scalar to calculate the area of the image, and the vector to plot what happens in a camera's lens when you zoom with a certain zoom distance. This will have an effect on the amount of light being reflected off the area of the image.<n>Output: [Scalar and vector] [Vector]<n><n>Input:The amount of days it takes a car to travel from Kansas City Missouri to Tulsa Oklahoma.

While he was at the gun store, a man approached on a motorcycle with 4 other passengers. He asked if they would like to ride with him, so they drove to the parking lot. As they were riding past the parking lot, the man saw the Mosin-Nagants and wanted to stop and buy one. The other passengers, however, refused and drove off. The man on the motorcycle wanted to go back home so he followed them and asked to use their phone. The man on the motorbike gave the man the names of the people who had refused to let him use their phone with them; a couple of them were high school kids, but the man chose to take the deal with the people who were not. He bought the Mosin-Nagin's, put all four magazines in his pockets and walked home. After getting home, he unloaded the weapon, put all four magazines into a storage container and locked it. He took an axe, a screwdriver, a wrench and one of his knives out of his closet. He came down the stairs and got his clothes out of his closet. Then he went out onto his back porch and climbed in his closet and sat on his chair. Using his axe to break the locks, he opened the closet and found a.22 caliber shell casing, a shotgun shell casing and a magazine. He realized that he had not been to a gun store and did not know about the need to buy magazines

She had a total of eight $10 cards. Of the first gift card, 10 percent of the money would be given to her, and she could choose the other three percent of money in whatever amount she wanted. The other three percent would not be divided equally, but all would be donated from the $10 gift card that she had given everyone the first day of the class. At the end of the semester, the professor chose to split all the money, dividing the $10. She left the first $10 card to each guest in her classroom. If anyone wanted more than one $10 card for any reason, he or she was to deposit the money, together with its receipt, directly into Professor's paypal account. If anyone asked for money back after the class, he or she would owe the full amount of money back to the account. If anyone ever requested money back, it was to pay back the tuition. Professor did not have any interest to her guests. The first three guests did not use any of their gift cards. A student, who had four gift cards, used all four of his cards on a night out with his friend, and spent the last half an hour of class waiting to pay the full amount back to Professor. Professors paypal account was completely empty. She was forced to stop the class early by paying the teacher's late tuition, the extra $15 that her guest spent on her, and her own personal expenses.<n>Output: A<n>Correct Answer: 21<n>Submitted by: Mr.Chai<n><n>Input:<n>What's the distance between the earth and the moon after it's closest distance of about 400 miles?<n>Output:<n>(5.5 miles)<n>Submitted by: D3b<n><n>Input:<n>Who have the most letters in their name?<n>Output:<n>Dylan<n>Submitted by: C<n><n>input: How many words

While he was playing, a bully named Michael, who had never met Jason, started hitting him from behind. Someone heard Jason crying for help, and the bully went to the park to find Jason, and ended up beating Jason. When Michael found Jason, he tried to go back to hurt him, but instead found Lawrence, who helped Jason up. After he left, Michael went to the park to beat Lawrence, but found that Lawrence got a good enough beatdown that no one had been able to beat him. Then Michael went back to Jason's house to see if Jason would play with him, but Jason never let him in, so he had to go to the park. When he got there, he made a phone call, but Jason never answered. So he went to Jason's neighbor and asked if they had called Jason yet. The neighbor said that Jason wasn't there yet, so he asked for Lawrence's number. Lawrence had never given Lawrence his phone number, but he gave Lawrence his daughter's number. After Jason answered, Michael realized that he would have to take Lawrence to the hospital, so he asked Lawrence if he should go. Lawrence agreed. After he went, Michael ran back to the park and found Lawrence. Lawrence's father had also come and gotten him, and Lawrence left with him. When Lawrence went to his house, he turned on the lights, but before he could turn them off, a man named Bob appeared and said they couldn't go home without a doctor's note. Lawrence was scared that he had done wrong. Lawrence's father told him that what happened was legal, and that he would call the police if he felt it was worth it. When Bob left Lawrence alone, he found Lawrence passed out on the top of the basement steps. Lawrence was afraid to even answer the phone when Lawrence woke up. Lawrence fell asleep again, and finally when he woke up, he was alone. Lawrence woke up again, saw that his phone was off, and went down the stairs, and his neighbors were gone, so he made his way back upstairs. The police came right away to arrest Lawrence. Lawrence's father said that he could go to jail, but he would take him to court, and the judge made a written statement saying Lawrence was a special case. After he was arrested, Lawrence's dad said that he would take care of his little brother, so Lawrence

So, let’s take a moment to acknowledge all you teachers out there (and don’t forget, you have a friend at your school).<n><n>I love teachers. As both a parent and a teacher, I recognize and appreciate all that our teachers do daily. Whether you are a first grade teacher, a teacher of special needs students, or you are a teacher in the classroom, thank you for preparing our students for every day.<n><n>Every day is a big day with many new beginnings. As we all are coming down the last week of school, I hope you have enjoyed the experience. In the coming days, you will most likely be preparing for some big changes in your personal lives and family.<n><n>I’m sure you have already gathered many questions from your students this year as they are coming to me to learn more about careers. Whether you are a ninth grader planning for your future or an eleventh grader already graduating, I hope you will be finding answers to many of these questions this week. You have already worked hard in school this year and hopefully you have many more to prepare for.<n><n>I hope that you take some time today to explore a career that interests you to get a better idea of what it will take to excel in that profession.

Answer: When the two coin hands are to 2 coins, then if you have 3.1 you will play B and get a 7 instead of getting a 9 by playing one. But if they are 10 coin hands then there won't be an A or D. So, if you have 4.1 you will play both B and get a 7 by playing one. But, if you have 3.3 you will play only B and get a 7 or 8 by playing 1. As for A and C, one way is when you get a 7.1 you play it and that 7.1 won't go to another player when you play your 9. In that scenario play both but you would have the same number of coins.<n><n>Input:A 1 coin hand, B 10 coin hand, C 2 coin hand, E 3 coin hand, F 4 coin hand (all with 2 coins and 10 coins) and G 9 coin hand.

If she had been paying close attention, she may have predicted that the teacher would tell this student to come to class at 4:00 p.m. and he would show up late. She may also have guessed that the teacher would tell the student to be on time. And he would show up late!<n><n>The good students were probably quick to predict that the teacher would tell her to stay home. But, the great ones were quick to predict that she would make it to class, and she did just that. This was a perfect example of classroom organization, and we all learned a good thing about classroom organization today.<n><n>This is a great example of an individual's ability to quickly predict what is going to happen in a classroom environment. And, the teacher quickly predicted that this individual would be late. If she had been staying on top of this individual's behavior, she could have saved herself some time. She would have told the individual that he was late for class in the first place. If she had remained calm and rational, she could have predicted where this individual would be 20 minutes into class.<n><n>The other students learned that being calm, responsible, and calm is good for everyone, and the classroom environment will be more fun and interesting. They learned that their prediction was incorrect. They learned that they would not be happy to arrive 10 minutes early. And they learned that the students who arrived early would not be pleased to arrive 40 minutes late. And it only took an instant.<n><n>I think it is a great lesson about class organization. The group of students who arrived 10 minutes early for class thought that they were late. They thought the teacher would say so. But, if they had been calmer and rational, they probably would not have been late for class. The teacher did not need to let the student know that they would be late for class. They could have understood that their prediction was wrong. And, they would not have been disappointed. And the teacher would not have wasted her time and money to tell the student he was late for class.<n><n>One way to tell if a class is structured correctly is to notice when the rest of the class appears to be absent. That tells you that students are coming to class. That tells

Since I've worked in the customer service industry, I know that it is not uncommon for employees to stand and sit when they talk and interact with customers, even during a sale or meeting.

After I watched the movie "Passion of the Christ", I noticed the woman in a scene by herself, praying. I think the main point was if you're going to pray out loud, do it from the heart. People don't think too much about what you're saying and can't hear what you're really saying. Then, you start to have this dialogue in your head, and that helps with prayer and helps you get things done. It gives you this space where God is, and you are with him as a friend. That's the only difference.<n>Output: 14<n><n>Input:If you have a friend, you spend a lot of time together, but at the same time, you have different responsibilities.

You depend on him for friendship, for encouragement, and to lift you up as you go through difficult times. You can't do these things when you are by yourself. You would be crushed. So you will spend more time with the friend and less time on you. That means you spend less time together and more time with your work and your responsibilities that you cannot do on your own.<n>Output: 1<n><n>Input:When something is wrong, don't talk about the problems.

It is good for teaching about the effects of light through the lens of an image.

Choices:  A: damage B: cloud mind C: lower i.q D: cause illness E: cause accidents<n>Output:		 Does D qualify?<n><n>Response:<n>It does not. It does not prevent me from working those days because that is how the system in that region does not treat work time as a factor for their pay system. You can still come to work if your pay is lower than other.<n><n>In that case, your time there is still being considered in your pay for that work. The time you worked on those days is still paid to the company. Therefore, there are no credits taken for those days, at least none based on what you have already described.<n><n>In what situation would a company start taking credits for your time if you work the same hours each day and only if you work those days specifically?<n><n>That would be what I was talking about earlier. You would have to specifically request to work that way or the company would try to find a way to pay you based on the number of hours you worked each week.<n><n>The way I was picturing it, you were saying that if you worked the exact same hours each day and requested it, they would give you more hours than you were working. But my understanding is that if you are required to work extra hours to compensate for the extra hours your coworkers were working or if you requested it specifically then you would be paid accordingly?<n><n>A) Work extra hours every week B) Keep your schedule the same C) Work less hours D) Try to be fair and pay everyone to the same percentage<n><n>Response:<n>I think I may have confused you on B and C, by the fact that they wouldn't compensate me for hours worked on those days. It is still working hours on those days. So they would treat that as working time. I have to be paid based on hours worked no matter if it's on my own time or not though which is not the case with B or C. You are being paid the same amount regardless of how many were actually worked on your own time. However, you are being paid whatever the minimum wage is for whatever state you're in. If you need to work extra hours to offset that then you should have to pay for that extra time.<n><n>I have no idea where your company's policy falls on the issue. I thought I had been clear. You either work extra hours or you don't get compensated for those hours.

Candy Guy says, "It's just a pack." The family members ask Candy Guy why the candy is in his pocket. Candy Kid answers, "Candy Guy says no matter how much I beg he never will give in to my demands. I am always right and I am never wrong." The family members ask, "So he does always right?" Candy Guy answers, "He is always right." The family members ask him why he is always right and a few family members ask him, "Why is he never wrong? He said no matter how much I begged he never would give in to anything." Candy Guy answers, "Candy Kid would have you believe that I have no life or interests outside of the candy business." The family members ask the same question about Candy Guy's wife. Candy Girl answers, "Candy Girl is a horrible liar." The family members ask why Candy Guy says no matter how many times you beg he will never give in to anything. Candy Guy answers, "Because he is right, Candy Kid always lies." The family members ask how Candy Guy would respond to candy in a bowl and Candy Kid says he would eat the candy, and no one would notice he was eating the candy. The family members ask if Candy Guy would lie if he thinks something is true. Candy Guy says he doesn't look at lies and then Candy Guy sits down and eats a candy bar, saying something like "I am good at being the right person" and then he falls asleep. The family members check on Candy Guy an hour later, and ask Candy Guy, "Candy Guy, did you eat that candy bar?" Candy Guy answers, the candy bar was fine and never got cold. Candy Guy decides to change his personality and he begins to wear a scarf and a monocle, so he is more like the candy man.

Choices:  A: get smart B: boredom C: colds and flu D: taking tests E: spend time<n>Output:		 A<n><n>Suggested Answer:<n><n>Input:In order to earn money, there are only two things that will make you money....either doing what you're paid to do, or spending your time doing something else. Doing what you're paid to for money is called money making. Money making is not about wasting your time, because when you do earn money you get that satisfaction of making a living. There are only TWO ways you can earn money, so unless your goal is to waste your time earning money at your job or being an entrepreneur then you'll have a tough time making money....and for an entrepreneur to make money he/she has to have a large work force, which he/she can't do if he/she has just two workers.<n><n>Therefore, it's safe to say that you're not going to earn the money you want to if you're spending all of your time making money instead of earning it. Therefore, you shouldn't be wasting your time as a worker.<n><n>Suggested Answer:"I don't have time for school, I got a full time job!" is going to be a lot different from doing something with your friends to make money. The reason for doing something like that to earn money is because you don't have ANY time to do other things...you can't be busy spending time with your friends, you have to be busy earning money and finding ways to make money fast. So, if you're spending your time making money then you're not wasting your time with a full time job, but if you're spending your...<n><n>"Wasting their time."<n><n>Suggested AnswerYour family is calling eachother on the phone!

Answer: The first time is usually an experience, so many students say there was no first date.  They are more likely to say they had sexual intercourse with someone within the first 10 months of meeting.  They usually say they date in their 20s.  They will often state the type of first date they prefer: casual, casual, home, serious, date, casual home, date, casual.  A majority of guys say they are always looking to meet interesting people, while most girls prefer a steady relationship.  Both answers are accurate; however, the first date question is misleading.  It implies that the man wants to get to know the woman, the woman wants to get to know her date, and that the man is the one to approach the woman.  However, first dates can be an initial interaction like a coffee shop meeting, or a planned date like a restaurant or movie.  The date question is misleading, because it asks students about their first event, or first date.  It can be misleading if the survey asks about what it was like on the date, or is an event that leads to a successful date.  The survey can help determine whether a guy is available for a date, since he has many dating options.  Therefore, the questions on dating are different.  They should be less complicated and should have more questions related to the event.  However, a typical survey only asks about when they were sexually active.  This is not relevant to college women in the sense that the guys are typically looking for a serious relationship at college.  Many girls are looking for a good time, and are not always looking to commit.<n>Input: The first question in this survey is about first dates, but the question is misleading.  The question was asked on two separate surveys in which men and women were asked on their dating experiences,

When learning works best is one of the most challenging things to figure out in the world.<n><n>It can be helpful to look at your own work and have someone else grade it. Let's say the person you work with grades you on your essays. You might be inclined to ask to have those essays graded again, because that is what they tell you you score on. If he has an understanding of other people's standards in your work and finds the grades more encouraging, your grades will get more encouraging, and your teachers will see you improving. If you are not seeing the improvement needed, it could be that other students have noticed a change and they are giving you a hard time.<n><n>Your friends and family are going to feel sad and discouraged if they don't see you improving. You need to be able to say "Why am I getting poorer grades than other people, even if they are better than me?" If they don't believe your answers then you need to have a conversation about the subject. If you are not comfortable asking friends or parents for help there are some self-help books they could use or an older adult could be a good resource.<n><n>If you want help with school work in general it can be difficult to get help. If you are worried that you aren't achieving the standards you are setting for yourself you are probably not the person to figure it out. When people like your friends and family tell you that you have failed at something, they may not be helping you because they know that they can help you. They may not realize that it is going to be very challenging and difficult for you to work on the problem alone. You need to be as comfortable as possible with the person who can help the most. You need to know that it is not an isolated event, that it is happening to other students and that if you work on it you can get better. It is best to let the person you are working with help you with the problem at hand as much as you can to make sure that you are as successful as you can be.<n><n>Once you know that working it out is the best choice for learning, then you don't have to let it worry you too much about not

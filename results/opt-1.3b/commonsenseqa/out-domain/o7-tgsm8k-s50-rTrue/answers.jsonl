The coolers cost $150 each, while the free-water-coolers cost $50 each. If they sell 3,000 free-waters, how much revenue did they make on the first day?\nOutput: Since all free-waters were sold, they were worth $2,500.\nSo the initial investment was $2,500. But they sold only $500, so they lost $300.\nSo the initial capital investment was $1,000 but they lost $300.  So the initial capital investment of $2,500 was not worth it.\nSo the initial $2,500 was just a waste of money.   And the initial $500 loss is justifiable because they sold only 500 units.   So the full capital investment $2,500 was actually $900 more expensive than free-waters.\nSo the initial money spent or investment was $3,000.  But they only sold 3,000 units.  This is not a profitable venture.  So the initial money spend is $2,500 and the loss is $300.  So this is a poor business proposition.\nSo the initial invested $2,500 was spent, and the initial lost $300.  The average loss is $500 per machine.\nSo the initial lost was $8,000.  Or about $2 a month for the water-cooler.\nSo one out of four machines was profitable.\nSo the initial spent was $9,000  & loss was $300.

If Kelvin wants to be busy on his weekends, but he is not, and when Kelvin did something in the weekend, he was not busy, then he is angry. Kelvin wants to be busy. That means that Kelvin felt annoyed and that he was stressed. Because Kelvin wanted to be busy on Tuesday, he was angry; there was no other answer that fit this statement. So then Kelvin became upset because he was feeling angry.\nKelvin also felt stressed on Tuesday. Then Kelvin felt depressed and was feeling anxious. Since Kelvin was upset, all he could do was to be stressed; that means he felt angry. This is all there is to it. So the end is that Kelvin felt annoyed at not being busy.\nAlso, Kelvin didn\u2019t like doing housework. He wanted it to be simpler, but it was hard. He felt that maybe he should do different housework every week; he would be more relaxed. The problem was that Kelvin felt annoyed with the amount of housework he was doing. He has to do all of the housework; Kelvin did not like it. He had to do all of the work, but he wouldn\u2019t be as stressed. But this wasn\u2019t acceptable to him.

If he didn\u2019t choose to not take the position, would he have lost his job?\nOutput: Yes, John would have lost his job, but not from the decision to refuse a new position.  If he refused a new position and would have lost his job anyway, then John could have lost no money, but he would have taken a job that made a greater amount of money.\nThe final answer would be 66\n\nThe solution:\n1. It depends on what you consider to be the \u201cnew\u201d number; if you just add up all his annual total and divide it by 16, then you get a number that is less than 66. If your alternative is to count a number less than 33, then subtract 33 from its sum, then the final answer is 66.\n2. It depends on what kind of number you are calculating. Consider some numbers that are divisible by 0 and then add up all the numbers in that divisible set.\n3. It only depends on what you are calculating; if the sum of the components of the answer is too small, then just add an imaginary zero, then divide it by the resulting number.\n\nInput:John made $5,000 from eBay.

How much money did Jeff have left?\nOutputs: Total = <<3+250=$500>>50\nJeff had $50 from paying $25 for dinner, so he spent $25 on dinner. Now $25 is $2500. What did Jeff do with this $2500?\nSo the final answer $2500 is $2500 divided by 3.\nIf Jeff paid $25 on the $1000 budget, then he has $2500 left after paying for the dinner.\nIf he spent $25 on the $250 budget, then he has 2500 divided by 3 left.\nIf he spent less than $2500, then he has left between $2500 and$0.\nSo he has left between $0 and $2500.\n\nInput: After the three friends buy a new car, they have to split the money evenly between every employee. $15 was the minimum amount.

After they learn the new word correctly, the girl uses the name of a picture book to write a word. The new word they learn each day goes on a list that is then used to remember their new word. If one word does not end with a vowel, they try to end with an S sound, if one word finishes without an O sound, they try to end without a /p/. If they say a word they did not know, as a last resort, they say it silently. The parents use \"I see\" and \"I hear\" in the conversation to guide the girl to correct pronunciation. She tries these for a minimum of 2 sentences. After 2 weeks they will be able to understand all of English.\nThe girl's mother asks her daughter when it starts to be an issue.

The mother decides that she will buy one of each apple. She asks a passerby to get the apple from a tree in the park.\nInput: After asking the passerby to get the apples, the mother decides to pay for the only apple in the park. She asks the passerby to take the other apple from the tree. In the end, she pays $1.50 for the apple. What is the mother's cost?\nOutput: After asking the passer-by to take the apple from the tree, the mother costs $1.50. Because she asked all passers-by to give their apples to the tree, all parents should take their children back to home.\nSo it is a good example of a fair price for the apple.\n\nInput: If you have three apples, one for each of your children, the total value of the apples is 1.50. You cannot eat all three now because you will fill up at least two bowls. If you sell each apple for $0.50, you will have 1.75 left over. Therefore, how much money will you have?\nOutput: If you get one apple from the tree and get $0.50 per apple, the total money will be $1.25. If you sell all three apples together, the total remaining money is $2.00 because one of each apple was purchased.\nSo it is the best example of a bad example.\n\nInput: There is a restaurant that serves chicken nuggets on Mondays for $1.50.

The staff will now have to buy chicken nuggets using their own money, so they will need to make more money. They will now have to spend money on advertising.\nOutput: If two nuggets were sold and there were $0.50 left over, then the total money will be 1/2 (1/2*2) $1", "answer": "D: amusement park"}

If he finds a better job while working for his current company, how much money is he already making? (the average salary for the company is $27,300.

{"text": "$270 was divided between the two boys but $50 went to each boy to buy things or to feed fleas in the yard. Let's say $240 divided between Kelvin and Samuel equals $30 for each of them and $15 for each to buy things for fleas in the yard, $80 for each of them to spend on food for fleas. If these two men each took an extra $20 per month for food to feed their fleas, then all of this money would be $120 per year.\nTotal $120 + $60 + $20 = $135. $15 divided $120 for each man comes out to $120 for the total boys\nSo the final answer equals $135\n\nInput: In the example of the flea locomotive, the answer to A is $270 because it is the same amount as in the other two examples. For the answer B, $30 multiplied by $20 is $20, for the answer C, $60 divided by $20 is $60, and for the answer D the $60 divided by $30 equals $60, so yes, $270 is the correct answer. I found that $27.80 is the answer to B when $75 was the cost for the car. When $15/20 is added to the cost of the car, the answer to B drops to $12.90. So yes, $240 is the correct answer. The cost of the food for the fleas in the yard is not necessary included in the cost to buy the vehicles.\nOutput: $270 divided by $45.50 equals $135. So yes, $270 is correct. I also found the correct answer when $90 was the cost for the toys. I found that $18.50 is the answer to B, $50/90 = $18.50/30 = $18.50. If $30/75 was added to the cost of toys, the answer to B goes up to $23 for the total boys.\nTotal $135 + $30 = $270\nTherefore, $40 divided by $18.50 equals $80 and $6 divided by $18.20 equals $20, so yes, $135 is the right answer.\nOutput: $135 divided by $25, gives $40 divided by $27, giving $20 divided by $36, and so $108 is right. $180 divided by $10 and $8 divided by $36 gives $40 divided by 28 = $", "answer": "E: jump"}

{"text": "If human beings are exposed to noisy events, more positive reactions are produced than negative ones. This phenomenon is called negative event sensitivity. What is negative event sensitivity?\nInput: What happens to the human brain when there is a lot of noise around?\nOutput:  Negative event sensitivity can lead to increased concentration and ability to focus on certain things. The human brain is not designed to process a constant influx of new information or stimuli. Therefore, when the volume of noise increases, it can lead to a sense of disorientation, restlessness and anxiety. This is known as a 'noise shock' or 'loud noise shock'.\nOutput: Negative event sensitivity can also lead to increased awareness, improved performance and efficiency in some tasks or situations. Humans can usually compensate for this effect as long as the sensory information is well-organized and processed through a variety of neural pathways.\nInput: How does negative event sensitivity work?\nOutput: In one study it was determined that humans can have positive and negative event sensitivity simultaneously. Although there is not enough evidence yet to definitively answer this question, it is possible that positive event sensitivity can trigger negative noise-induced response while negative event sensitivity can trigger positive noise-induced response.\nSo the final question is still undecided.\nInput: There is an experiment in which rats are exposed to noise and are given positive or negative reinforcement on certain actions or behaviors in order to train them to do better in noisy conditions. The rats that do not receive positive reinforcement are exposed to the noise continuously. For those rats that were trained to do better when exposed to continuous noise, give them positive reinforcement on performing certain tasks. For example, those rats may be set to go out and chase rabbits on a large green field. Alternatively, negative reinforcement should only be given to those rats that were trained for continuous noise, meaning for example if the rats were taught to go on a small green field to chase rabbits, then have no positive reinforcement given to them during the repeated exposure.\nInput: What are the implications of negative event sensitivity for the training of humans to better manage noise at work?\nOutput: Negative event sensitivie has led to increased sensitivity on some types of tasks. Human beings usually know how to control themselves when the level of an environmental sound, like noise, is so high as to be detrimental to them. However, some people forget how to act when an environmental sound is abnormally loud as to be detrimental to their health.

{"text": "A,D,E\n\nInput: It costs 4 dollars to drive from St. Francisville, LA to Broussard, LA. How many miles would you need to drive in an hour while staying in a hotel? What is your highest average mileage?\nOutput: It takes 6 hours to drive from St. Francoisville, LA to Brossard, LA. In an hour, you would drive 4,000 miles, this would be 10 hours to drive in 6 hours. In an hour, the most you can travel would be 15 miles, this would go for 5 hours and 20 minutes. So in 6 hours, the mileage for an hour drive would be 9,000 miles instead of 10,000. So in an hour, it would take 12+9=30 miles in total.\nOutput: In an hour, you drive 9,000 miles in total\nSo in 6 hours, you would drive 12 miles.\n\nOutput: If I pay my electric bill by phone, how many minutes do you think it will take? My phone bill is $30, I will pay the phone bill with $3. What will you do with the $3? The phone bill is $9.00. How many minutes would you think it will take to pay the phone bill with a $3 bill?\nOutput: If I paid my bill by phone, then a $3 bill would take you 6 minutes to call me back. It would take you 24 minutes to call me back once I answered your phone call.\nThus a $9 bill would take 24+6 = 36 minutes to make a phone call. Thus in 6 seconds, it would take you 36 minutes to call me back, thus $36 divided by 6 = $9 divided by 36 minutes in total. So in total, the phone bill for a phone call will take 1/3 minutes to pay.\nAverage time to give a phone call: ~60 seconds\nAverage time to call a phone company: 1 minute 25 seconds\nAverage time to answer a phone call: 1 minute 42 seconds\nAverage time to explain a phone call: 1, 50 seconds\nAverage time to be on call: 1, 50, 1/3minutes\nAverage time to be disconnected: 1, 50 min 1/3 minutes\nAverage time to be charged: 1, 50 cents\nAverage time to receive a phone call: 1 hour 12 minutes\nAverage time to wait for a call back: 3 hours\nAverage time to wait: 24 minutes", "answer": "D: become tired"}

How many bags of potatoes does an apple weigh? Is the square root of two whole apples equivalent to the square root of two apples squared? Find the answer to these questions with this interactive geometry.\nOutput: There are 3 different apples on the table. There are 3 bags of apples on the table and there are 3 bags of potatoes in this box. All three bags are enough to fill each row of one square.

They wanted to buy a house in the same zip code as their current home, which is 40 miles away. They knew very little about the real-estate market, so they didn\u2019t want to buy a home for too much money, and they wanted the house to be close to their office. They also didn\u2019t want two mortgage payments. They talked to 4 real estate agents from four towns. Then they called 2 of the 4 who agreed to do the sales. They had already been buying a piece of property, so this was not necessary. When the salesman called to verify their income, they found out that a large part of their income was being taken to pay off the house on one bank account, and they needed all of the money they could get.\nOutput: They bought the property and gave the seller a good deal (upgrade + close to office + other bonuses).\nThe couple bought a house in 20 miles of where they would be living, so they moved in 3 weeks after they bought the house, took the mortgage payments, and moved out 3 months later. Their real-estate agent told them to not be so conservative, and he did charge them about $2500 up front, but most of it was already paid for.\nSo the final solution is to buy the property, not move in for a while, and then sell it later on for their originally estimated price.

The remaining $10 was divided among the teachers after paying each teacher a one-cent amount for each page of reading that was read. If a student received $10, divide it by the number of pages read.\nOutput: All the money collected was divided among the teachers.\nIf each of the students only received $10, then the teacher should receive at most $10. Divide every amount into $10 chunks so that the teacher only received $10, but $40 was split among all the classmates.

This is done by dividing each amount into $10 chunks by every group members or friends.\nSo the final total equals $40\n\nInput: John, Angela, Andrew, and Jennifer visited their grandmother on Easter. Her house had two bedrooms and a kitchen with a dining room. The room had two beds. The beds were in two different places. The room also had a balcony. John bought the beds and mattresses from Andrew. What number of beds were they assigned?\nOutput: If each of the four students share 5/11 beds, then each of the students received 2/11 beds.\nIf each of them receives 2/11 beds, then the total number of beds assigned to students is 4/11 beds. Divide the total number of beds by 4 students. Divide that number by 10 because that number is the number of beds. This is done by multiplying each number by the number of students (so there would be 2-10 split between all the students).\nThus the number of beds is 2/10 divided by 10.\nThe total number of students in the classroom is 4/11 divided by 4 divided by 10.\n\nInput: John was born and lived in Texas.

Jake sent an anonymous letter in English class to ask to be excused; however, this letter sent directly to Mrs. Vollmer was not counted as received. Therefore, the amount of $15 in the allowance Jake has received was $15 divided among Jake and his father.\nBecause Jake received his allowance for two years already, his check total was $15, which equals $15 divided among Jake + his father. So the final total is $15 divided among Jake, his father, Mom\nSo the total for the month was $10.30 - $15 = $10.30\n\nInput:The teacher assigned all the children to do some kind of writing project.

After completing his ice cream test, Richard walked into the restaurant and talked to the owner, ordering some ice cream cones for his team. He walked into the restaurant and picked out some ice cream to make. Using a special fork, Richard poured about 6 ice cream cones into the bowls, and he put out the table and set them out at the table next to them. After sitting down at the table for his team, Richard sat down at the right hand side of the table and poured another 6 cones into the bowls and put the bowls out on the table next to them for his friends to choose from.

He paid that down over 7 years, starting at 12 % interest. His loan is $12,000. He decided to go ahead and invest another $1000 in stocks. Over the next 5 years, should he continue to invest? (If so, what stock should he invest in?) Or should he pay his interest bill sooner rather than later? Which will be more beneficial, investment or paying off the credit card?\nOutput: John decided to continue to put $1000 into the stock market annually. If we assume that John's investment will return 8% per year, the total is $60,000 divided between $1200/1/5 = $<<6000/5=12>>12 stocks.\nIf his investment returned 8% per year, then the total after 5 years is $120,000. If it returns 8% per year, it is $60,000 + $16,000 = $80,000\nSo John decides to continue to invest $1000 for 5 years. If his stock returns 8% per year then it is $60,00 + $5,000 = $80K\nSo the final answer will not exceed $80K.\n\nInput: A is the employee with the highest annual salary.

{"text": "Change A: riots. Change B: vote. Change you: social activism. Change clothes: social activism.  Change\n\nInput: $50 (per student) is spent per day in school. To get the percentage needed to get the maximum amount spent per day, calculate the total amount spent per school year. Then, total amount spent per school day is divided by 12. Then divide by 11. If the amount spent is 11, add 1, if the amount spent is 10, divide by 9, if the amount spent will reach 11, divide by 8. If the amount spent will reach 12, divide by 7. If the amount spent reaches 13, divide by 6. If the amount spent gets close to the final goal, then you can use the $1 in the original amount of funds to add 2 on to the final number. The final result will be x for x/11 days x number of students. This is the sum of all the funds needed for that day: $.11 (1/11 days) x1 x10x2 = $.18. You will need to divide $.18 by 11 for every day to get the numbers that should work out with the time allocated for that day. If the first four calculations show an amount of $.11 or less then you need to add in the 5th to get the amounts you'll need. The first time I made this calculation here it worked for me. Therefore, if you're confident that you will be able to get the $11 necessary for that day then it seems obvious that you need to add 5. However, if the sum of the times given for each day is higher than what that amount is, then the answer will be different. On that day, we will calculate an amount of $1 if it is a Saturday; $.05 if it is a Sunday; $.001 if it is a Monday; $.00 if it is an afternoon class. If you do not have any extra funds it doesn\u2019t matter as your $7 would still be divided by 11, so the number should be just like above. You should be able to do the same calculation on the days that you have more funds available.\nLet\u2019s take Monday as an example, so Sunday should be Sunday 1.

So total $11.50.\nSo the total contribution of the three guys is $11.50, which equals $100/3 men = $<<100+3=200>>200\nSo the final answer, $200 divided by 3 = $200+200 = $<<200-200=200>>200\nIf $200 total + $200/3 men = $200/200, the farmer divided $200 by 200 = <<200/200=48>>48 men would be $<<200/48=12>>48\nSo the farmer divided the entire total $200, $200 is divided by 48 men = <<120/200=8>>8 men would be $<<120/200=36>>36 men would be $<<300/8>>36 men are $<<600/8>>36 men would be\nSo the final answer from the farmer is 36\n\nInput: What is a farmer's favorite way to use a knife?

He decides to take his business to a different location. Would you go to the new location because of the extra money?\nOutput: If he takes his business he will not lose $300.\nIf he keeps his business and loses $300, he may choose to take his business to another location, but not to the first.\nSo the second question of the experiment is, \"Are the two men the same or different in the same way?\"\nThe \"same\" way is a gamble.

Take the first four responses off the top, and the answer is A, C, and D. How many letters were there in the sentence?\nOutput: 5/4 is the number of letters, but we are not going to take the first four letters off the top. That number will be $10 for a correct answer, $4 for a right answer, and $10=<<$10> for an incorrect answer. So the total number of letters will be $10 in total, but only $6 will be $10. (That last number is 1+2 + 3, so the total of 4 is 1.)\nSo the total cost of the answers is $10 + $6. So the final answer is 11, which is $10 divided between the two people.\nSo with a total of 5 letters, $10 is $10 divided between both people.

He had to write down the answers to the computer trivia questions in the computer.\nOutput: Each correct answer would result in one point and one question. All the correct answers would result in four points. Therefore, John had four correct answers and a total of four points. To get one point for each correct answer, he needed a total of eight items.\nSo the total points for John would be 1*1*8 = 18 and there would be four items left after he used his three items in his computer. This means John had 18 more items in his pocket than he used. Therefore, he had 27 items in his pocket after he used the items in his computer. So the total points for John were 2*27*10 = 55.\nSince the computer trivia questions have two questions, and there is a total of four items, John had 55 points and he only needed one item. Therefore, he won the computer.\nSo the final amount and score for John was 2*55*15 = 100\nOutput: Total number of items needed: 84 items.\nTotal score for John: 40\n\nInput\n\nInput - The following answers are correct:The question: Which is the closest to the center of the globe in terms of latitude and longitude?

How would people respond to each question?\nOutput: Karl lied, which means he cannot give Karl the price back. But Karl is not required to pay the $15, so he can pay $25 and get the money back tomorrow.\nSo the final question is \"How would people respond to each situation?\"\nInput: People are paying Karl $15 but Karl says he is not going to pay, which means everyone's money is gone.

Who would buy more books?\nOutput:If price of the book is $20 and price of two books are $30, the total price of books divided by two = <<20/2=15>>15, meaning two people would buy more than one book\nThe two people buying one additional book would buy 1/2 of the amount of books divided by 2 (i.e., 10 books), so they would buy only 1/2 of the additional book worth $30. So their total would be 1/2 of 15 x $30 = $<<15/2=120>>120\nOutput: If more than 60% of readers purchase books from the same publisher (Faber and Faber), then that publisher will be able to sell an equal amount of books to readers. Because the percentage of readers buying from the same publisher (i.e., an equal amount of books) is 60%, the publishers will not be able to sell more books than that.\nTherefore, the publishers will fail.\nSince it takes 20 books to have the same effect as one book on one person, the publishers cannot sell more books than that\nTherefore, the publishers shall fail so that books are not being purchased.\nSo there are several different answers.\n\nInput: If the doctor and the teacher could see each other in the morning they would find it strange that they slept in separate rooms.

{"text": "John will try B but only if they can find A. John has 3 roommates. At one point, one of the three roommates decided to move.  Which would cost John more money: the house or the rent?\nOutput: The rent of staying in A costs John $30, but the house rental would cost him $130.\n John would not pay more for A even if he must move and spend more time at home.\nSo the final question is, \"How much money has John left to spend on luxuries?\"\nOutput: $130 * 3 = $240\nThis gives John $2,280 at the end of his stay\n\nInput: John was tired of being on the receiving end of his friends' gifts. He planned to create some more of his own. John would donate toys to a childrens\u2019 shelter.  What would these toys cost him?\nOutput: John would donate $25 to the shelter and $15 to a charity.\nA box with 15 children's toys would cost $25. John would put them in a box with a value of $35.\nThis is what John would give the shelter: 5 $15 toys, 6 $15 toys.\nThis is what the charity would buy: 1 $15 toy, 4 $25 toys.\nFinally, John decides to create $35 toys to distribute as gifts to families.\nHow much money is John\u2019s donation worth?\nOutput: $35\nSo the donation is worth $35/1.3 = $33.85. Note: Remember to deduct the tax and shipping charges.\nThe $33.85 is enough to cover 5 toys for families.  So John will donate 5 toys = $33.85 x 5 = $33.85/5 = $533.85\nSo the final answer should be $533.85.\n\nInput: John made a list of 12 gifts he was going to buy for his friends.

The total amount was $240. If the two friends split 50 shares of this gift card, which number would be half?\nOutput: The gift card is $200, so they each bought 50 gift cards. Then they purchased $10, so each of them purchased a total gift card amount of $20. They will receive $20 after splitting the gift cards.\nSo each half of the gift card is $70, plus each half is $20. The total is $240.\nSo each friend has $210 after splitting the gift card amount.

But when Lauryn and Aurelia each brought 4 pies to make 7 pies, the original question changed to a pie chart of a different kind. Lauryn and Aurelian can only make 21 pies. If they combine, that gives them the overall goal of 27 pies. Lauryn and Auriel can add 5 more pies and get the total to 31 pies. The average pie weighs 3.5 grams. Lauryns total weight is 13.5 grams, which is 15 grams more than Aurelias. So Lauryns overall weight is 2.5 grams, or a difference of 2.8 grams\nInput: If the goal was to fill the pie plates as large as possible, then Aurelias pie looks pretty full. Lauryns pie looks about the same or maybe a bit smaller. So Aurelia made 14 of the pies with 12 pies on each plate. The rest of the pie plates are empty. How full is Lauryns pie?\nOutput: Lauryns pie looks empty and Lauryn\u2019s looks more than 1/3 filled. Which one is full?\nInput: The original question was to fill a jar with 6 different ingredients so that all the ingredients could be measured. If 1 of these ingredients is 3 grams or less, how different are the measurements from the Jar of 6 Ingredients?  Output: The original goal was for the ingredients to be 3 grams or lower than the jar of 6 ingredients. A 1/3 weight difference is 3 grams and the rest is 4 grams or greater. If that difference is 2 grams or less, there is usually at that difference or less, a.5 gram difference. So the difference is less than 1 gram, less than 2 grams and less than 3 grams. Therefore, one gram less than the rest of the jar is.5 grams, and 1 gram less than the rest is 2 grams. Lauryns pie has 21/2 grams less than the other pie, making 28/2 grams less than a second larger pie. The whole Jar of 6 Ingredients has less in total than 8 grams. Therefore, Lauryns pie has more total than the Jar of 6 Ingredients. So Lauryns pie has 31/2 grams more\nInput: The", "answer": "C: spreadsheet"}

{"text": "One secular birthday party = one event per lifetime = 1 event per life\nThe secular party was held weekly in the beginning and monthly in the summer. Since there was no secular birthday celebration throughout the year the following yearly secular parties take place: one annual secular birthday party, one yearly secular Christmas party. Yearly secular parties also occur in the following years: one yearly secular party, one yearly secular Halloween party, one yearly secular Thanksgiving party. The annual secular birthday parties last for 24 months. It\u2019s important to note that secular parties only take place on Saturdays, because the children can\u2019t go to secular parties any other day.\nFor example, one secular birthday party (Year 1 secular party) lasts 24 months. So one lifetime secular party took place every month for 24 months.\nOne secular party lasts 1 year.\nIf everyone has birthday, therefore, 24 people celebrate a secular birthday party per year.\nThe number of yearly secular events is 1 per month for 24 months. So everyone celebrates 1 secular birthday party per month.\nThe number of annual secular birthdays is 1 per year for 24 months. So one annual secular birthday took place every month for a year.\nFor the number of events, then, there are 4 different secular birthday celebrations.\nSince 1 birthday party lasts a year, 1 of those years has to be secular. Therefore, there are 4 secular birthdays per year every 1 year.\nTherefore, secular birthday celebrations last for 24 months, so 36 events take place each year. We have 36 secular birthdays throughout the year.\nThe number events each year is 1. So because secular birthday celebrations take place every month, 36 events took place in the year.\n(36 \u2013 24) = 21 = 12 = 2 secular events\nBut let\u2019s take that 12 times, and compare it to the secular average of 9 events. If you calculate it like that, it means there were 27 events that took place throughout the year.

How many of the 12 did the farmer manage to herd.\nInput: The farmer got 12 sheep but only 3 of them could herd because of their weight. He then asked the first three sheep if they could be his herders. The first two sheep got scared and ran. The third and last sheep got excited and began to run, so the farmer asked them to get him off the other sheep. The three sheep then got in the car and drove the farmer to the market. How was the farmer able to get all the sheep to the market.\nOutput: The third sheep had no choice. The farmer asked the first and last sheep to herd him, so he could drive the last sheep to the market. Once he got there, they had to keep the first two sheep busy, so that they could not herd themselves. So they herd themselves too. They put the last sheep back on the car and drove themselves back to the market.\nSo the farmer finally got 12 sheep. What was the time it took them to get to the market.\nAnswer: 3 hours or 13 minutes\n\nInput: The farmer had to collect all the sheep to bring to the market. He divided the sheep into four groups. In each group, six sheep were gathered. Using information gathered from these six sheep, the farmer divided the remaining sheep into three groups. Using four of the six sheep, the farmer gathered one sheep, one sheep, and two sheep. In each group, 2 sheep were gathered.  Using information gathered from these 2 sheep, the farmer divided more sheep in each group. Using four of the 9 sheep groups, the farmer gathered 11 sheep, 2 sheep, 9 wool sheep, 3 wool sheep, 15 wool sheep, 15 wool, and 17 of the remaining sheep. Using 3 of the 12 sheep, the farmer gathered 7 wool sheep, 2 wool sheep, 3 wool wool, and 4 wool sheep. Using 2 wool and 7 wool sheep, the farmer picked up 17 of the sheep.

When he went to the store to buy the 1/5 egg, he could have gotten $100 back, not $120 as stated in the question.\nSince the sticker had a dollar value, he had to pay that dollar amount, leaving him with $90.\nThus, all of his money left from bringing home the eggs was returned to him so he could keep bringing home the eggs.\nThus, he spent exactly $90 for the 1/5 egg. The only money lost was the $10+$10=$110 bill at the store. There is nothing lost from the extra $10 when buying another egg.\nThus, $110 was the money lost due to taking out an unnecessary bill. If a bill is needed to pay a bill, the bill should be taken out. There is no money to buy another egg with this money as the grocery store bill was paid for. There is nothing lost. Thus $110 does not belong in the egg money category.\nThus $110 is not a lost money. Thus $110 is not a spent money.\nSo $110 is not spent.

So Kelvin's ruler is $150 and $210 and Samuel's ruler is $50. So Kelvin's ruler and $210 is $210/2 = $100 or $120, which can be divided by the same number $75. So in addition to dividing $210, $75, and $60 that way, we can divide $75, $60 and $75 and get $90, $100 and $125 respectively. So Kelvin's ruler, $150 and $125 and $100, $80 and $150 is $105. So Kelvin's ruler was paid or sold $105 and $90. The remaining is $100, $60 and $60. So Kelvin's ruler must have been bought or sold. So its original value is $105. So we can find Kelvin's ruler by subtracting $105 from $100. Now we are getting $105. So our new value of $105 is $100 minus $105. So the actual value is then $95. So our original cost is $95 and we got $105. So if Kelvin had paid for the ruler using $100, we would still have $100 minus $105 which is $90; we can then subtract $60 from $105 and get $70, which is in our case $75. So Kelvin's ruler has been bought or sold for $150. So to divide the $105 between the two of them we have $70: $70/($60-$63)/2 = $35.\nOutput: In the first story, Kelvin\u2019s ruler is $100, $70, which is $120. So our new value would be $105 *120 = $80. So after dividing $40, he could use the money as collateral to borrow money to sell his own ruler", "answer": "C: office"}

If he pays $400 a month for 30 months, and the car has a price of $8,000 at the end of the loan, how much interest will he pay?\nOutput: After paying $400 for car for 30 months, the car buyer has $13,600 loan debt, so interest will be $1,000 a month for 30 months.\nSo the final result is $13,600 - $1,000 = $<<13,600-1,000=$848>>848 per month.\nThere are no monthly payments. So the interest charge is $1,000 a year for 30 months, so $848 x 30 = $848,500\nIt would add up to $4800\nTotal interest charge = $4800 x $4800 = $<<4800-480=848>>848,500\nSo the final answer was $4800\n\nInput: The bank loan that the house seller took out is $50,000, and the buyer has only $25,000.

It has actually been 14 years since a hurricane hit the USA coasts so this year will probably not be an unusual hurricane year.   The average years for hurricanes to hit the USA coasts have been about 10 years in a row.  The last year with an extremely strong storm (which is a category 4 or 5 hurricane) was 2005.

There are two options -- one is to go to the North Shore, and the other is to go to South Station, but where is the best area to find a bay in the South Station area?\nInput: The best place to find a bay is the South Station area, because the town's coastline is located near the North Shore. But given that the North Shore will never be the best area to find the bay, I'm trying to identify a bay that can be searched in the South Station area.\nOutput: There is a bay that can always be found in the South Station area, but you would find it most easily to go to Westport around Downtown Boston.\nInput: The closest area to where it is almost always possible to find a bay along the coastal shoreline of Los Angeles is South Coast Plaza. What is the closest area where you would find a bay that is never found farther up the shoreline?\nOutput: There is no close area to find a bay along South Coast Plaza's shoreline. Because there is no long distance to travel to find a bay far from shore, I would recommend looking at South Coast Plaza.\nInput: What is the best strategy for searching the coastline of Los Angeles?\nOutput: Since South Coast Plaza is the closest place where I can find a bay far from the coastline of the Southern California, I'm going to explore that location while avoiding South Coast Plaza, because this area is known as an extremely wealthy part of Los Angeles.

John buys a boat for $200, then saves $10 on gas and $30 on food each month. After a year, he has $750.00 in his account. He owes his mother $100, so he gets 10% of the leftover money of $750.00 from his savings. How much money would the father have left if John had not kept his extra money? (If the father keeps it all, he has $800, if he passes it on to his son, he has $200.00 left.)\nOutput: If he kept his money all, the son has $200 left in his account. If he passes on the extra money to his son, he adds $200 to his account.\nSo the final total answer is $150\n\nInput:John was sent a bill by a credit card company for $1000 + interest charges. On the front of the check the credit card company said that they would send him $500 by check and $1000 in cash.

If he declines the check and refuses to accept the cash, his school will increase his financial aid package by 5% (5*1000/5", "answer": "D: venice"}

He can then use half of this money to pay off the lease payments.\nSo an investment of $250 thousand dollars yields the same amount of money as only $250 thousand, so $250 thousand = >>$50 thousand=$50 000\nTherefore, the money is the same, so $50 thousand = >>$50 ousand.\nSo $50 thousand = >> $50 million=$50 million.\nSo $50 million = >> $50 trillion.\nSo $50 trillion = >> $50 quadrillion.\nSo $50 quadrillion = $50 x quadrillion.\nSince $50 trillion = ($50 x - X)$50 x squared, $50 quadrillion equals $50 x x squared + ~~2x**2x = $50 x x squared = $50 x x + ~~2x^2x\u00b2 = $50 + ~~2x*2x**2x -", "answer": "A: reach tentative agreement"}

{"text": "The more quality tennis balls a player can get, the higher their chance of success. As you see, each of the three quality tennis balls requires different skill. If the tennis balls are all the same ball, then the player will only win if they hit one quality ball. If the balls are all different balls, the player will have to hit one quality ball to win. In other words, the quality of the balls can be graded in a different way than in the other games.\nSo, what is the highest quality ball? There is only one player: John McEnroe. McEnroe has played in more majors than any other player. Even when he was younger than most adults, he was still great at winning matches. Therefore, the highest quality ball that McEnroe has played with is the best-grade tennis ball. On the other end of the ball spectrum is a player named Bill Tilden. Tilden plays on a court rated for the age of his opponent. When Tilden plays a tourney, he plays with the balls of the balls of the previous player. Therefore, the lowest quality ball that he has played with is the lowest quality tennis ball. When he plays a match against a player who plays with the balls of a previous player, the ball that Tilden throws is of a worse condition than the balls used in the previous match. This means that the ball that he throws will always be worse than the balls used in this previous match. The balls used in the previous matches were all of a different quality ball than the balls used in Tilden's match. Therefore, it is also possible to use the tennis balls that were used in the previous match to throw better than the balls used in a current match. Therefore, the lowest-quality ball that Tilden plays with in every tournament is the lowest-quality tennis ball. So, McEnroe can win matches but only if his opponent plays poorly. Therefore, the best quality ball that McEnney has played with is the ball that is of the same quality as the balls used in matches prior to that. On the other end, Tilden has a much better quality ball that he uses than the balls used in matches throughout his career. As you can see, the three kinds of balls play differently. Each player's skills differ based on the quality of the tennis balls they use during matches. In other words, each player's skills can be graded more than one way.\nTherefore, the high-quality ball that Mc", "answer": "B: skill"}

How much money would we need to spend?\nOutput: For the $1200 we would like to buy the tickets, we need to spend $1200 of our money = <<1200-600=900>>900\nSo we must spend a total of $900, which is $1200 / 2 = $1200 divided between 2 people\nSo the final answer for the question is 900\n\nInput:Let\u2019s say you have the amount you want to put in the pool so you have $600 dollars to spend on your kids.

Would you still have to feed the puppy every fifteen minutes?\nOutput: If you got a dog, would you have to walk it every fifteen minutes?\nKip wouldn\u2019t be barking every half an hour any more, and the puppy would have to eat more food. The average dog gets 25 calories per hour, so the puppy would get 60 calories from food, not 25, making the dog only 15% full. So Kip would need 60 calories for a three hour walk. So the average dog eats 1,400 calories a day, so Kip would need 30,400 calories to move a three hour walk, 10 minutes a day. So he would need to eat 7,800 calories for a three hour walking period. So Kip would receive 900 calories for the same work as the two previous ones. So in total Kip gets 1400 calories for walking a three hour period only\n\nInput: A bird flew from the sun to space.

Calculate the total amount of money you are spending on different things with this same amount of money.\nOutput:\n\nInput:\n1. What is the difference between the total income at the beginning of the year and $1 at the end of the year?\nOutput:\n\nThe first thing to do when it comes to economics is to realize that every situation is different. There are many rules that apply to situations but never to all situations. There are also many situations where it makes more sense to try to maximize the gain in a certain situation. The reason for the confusion is that there are always rules that apply to situations (the game principle), however, rules that fit different situations and may conflict with each other (the inequality principle). In situations where there is a problem with all rules applying and there may be conflict in the rules, we should do away with the conflict in the rules. This will make the rules that apply to situations work together to solve the problem and make the result simpler.\nHere is some advice you can use to help make better decisions:\nRule 1: Be honest when you deal with people. When people do not treat you as you like to be treated, they are not honest with you.\nRule 2: It is not a big deal to lose money once in a while. You don't have to make 100 times your amount of money in a day to feel good or to be happy. When you are happy, you are comfortable and you do not feel the stress of failing. You take breaks instead of risking all your money.\nRule 3: You may never win at gambling. What do you care for the win that is very small in value? It may be more effective and efficient for you to put extra effort in the areas you want to grow.\nRule 4: You may never see someone you can respect more than once a week. In order to do that, you must become a friend. It takes some time but it is worth it.", "answer": "A: suicide"}

Would she save it and pay it off at a later time or would she save it for a rainy day?\nOutput: Her friend gave her $10 which she took right away, and then her friend also gave her $10, which she also took right away. So then her friend gave her $100 which she also took right off the bat and then gave her $400 which she also took right after that. And so on. So eventually, her friend gave her $600 which she also took right from her as well and finally, she gave her $800 which she also took from her. So the friend who had most of her money left by the end was, in total, $1600 richer than her, because she gave the most to her friend and also started giving to her friend when her friend gave her money. So she made a total of $1600 which was more than her half of what she had received.\nSo the total was $1600/$10 = $1500.\nSo it was $1500 * $400 = $1200.\nSo the total after all the money she received from her friends was $1200.\nSo she made $1100 and now $1000 because of these two gifts.\n\nIf I have a total of one thousand dollars in cash, can I decide on a percentage or a fraction?

The total cost to pay for all the stimulus programs was $20,000\nSo $16,800 + $20,000 = $25,000 needed to pay for the stimulus program.\nSo the total stimulus cost was $25,000 / 48,800 = $37,500 needed to pay to support the stimulus plan.\nSo the total $37,500 * 48,800 = ~$50,000 needed to pay to support stimulus program.\nSo total $38,500 = >$100k needed", "answer": "E: house"}

What was that roommate\u2019s total in exchange for putting on the sleepover?\nOutput: Based on the photo, the total in exchange for putting the sleepover together and taking a picture was $65.\nIf one roommate receives $40 as an expense, then all four roommates receive $35, so they received $65.\nIf more than one roommate receives expenses, then none of the four roommates receive any additional expenses.\nHow would you calculate those expenses?\n\nInput: One roomate had $6.00 while his roommate and neighbor each received $3.00, but had both gotten a check for $5.00 each, how much $6 did the roomate owe his roommate?\nOutput: The roommate will repay his roommate by paying him the $6 plus $3 minus $3=$5.\nThe total after subtracting his portion of the check, thus the check is $5.\nSo the check is $9 which is less than his $6, but it was more than a his roommate\u2019s, which puts him ahead by $9.\nSo the final $9 has to be from his portion of the check as it is more than the original $5.\n\nInput: It cost 2$ to register and 2$ to join an orchestra.

{"text": "A\nJohn decided to have sex for 6 months, which equals 36 months divided by 12 equals 36=24=3/4\nJohn and Jane then had sex for 4 months, which equals 36+4=54 months, which equals 36*12=60. So John and Jane\u2019s relationship lasted one year. How is this possible?\nOutput: John and Jane didn\u2019t actually make sex for three months, but each of them made love 54 times. So if they made love every day 24 hours a day for the 3 months, they would have been intimate every day for 24 hours a day. So there was no sex for 36 months. But John and Jane\u2019screwed each other up and didn\u2019t work out, so they were together for only one year and only one year of sleeping together equals one year. However, because they fucked each other up for 12 months of the year, John and Jane are now together for 24 more months at the equivalent of 36=360. Now for the year that they did have sex, and John and Jane fucked each other up, they would have had sex a total of 360 times by the end of the year.

So you only get paid $25+80/2=$50/month\nTo make the maximum income on education, you must work for 32 hours a day, 6 days a week for two years.

The chef mixes 5 slices in a bowl with some other ingredients. Then he sprinkles it with sugar. The next time the chef puts 10 slices on his toast, he has to mix 5 slices with some other ingredients in the same bowl. What is the texture of the last mix?\nOutput: In this example, if the chef mixes cream cheese with sugar but does not add 5 additional slices to the mix, then the sandwich has a regular texture and the texture was regular.\nThe chef changed the texture so the bread had three more textures. One of them is different from the others. So the final texture was mixed but there were also three more textures.\nSo the final result for the mix is mixed+5^4 = <<5^4=20>>20\nThe resulting texture will also have a hardness.

A and B are the same age. Each child can drink 16 ounces of milk. A then drank his 16 ounces and poured himself another 16 ounces.B then drank 17/16 of the 16 ounces A and B drank. A then poured himself another 16 ounces of milk and finished with his 16 ounces. B drank 3/16 of the 16 ounce A and B drank 3/16. So B\u2019s portion was 16 ounces and his portion was 3/16. So his portion was 4 ounces. A\u2019s portion was 12 ounces and his portion was 13 ounces. So B\u2019S portion was 14 ounces.The four of them (A, B, C, A) make up 2 gallons of milk. The milk that all 4 gallons gets is divided by the four children and that ends up being 3.5 gallons. How many gallons can each child be filled? A and B would be 5 gallons. B and C are each 6 gallons. The two of them would be 6 gallons. Since only one child had a milk carton, it would be 7 gallons. The three of them together would be 10 gallons. The milk carton would end up being 6 gallons. So all would be 8 gallons. But since two of them didn\u2019t make a gallon and one didn\u2019t make 3.5 gallons, they would all be 10 gallons. So the whole milk, divided into two, was 12 gallons total. One gallon is made up of the four gallon total of two children plus two quart size milk cartons. The other gallon is made up of two quart size milk carton, plus one gallon of one of the children\u2019s portion. So a full 8 gallons of milk in two gallon milk cartons. Now, divide that by three and three plus four equals 5 gallons. So five gallons of milk in total. Since only one child can drink 16 ounces, and since two of the children didn\u2019t make gallons, so B and C aren\u2019t made up of one gallon each. So the milk gallon is 5 gallons x 3.5 gallons.

At the end of the year, each boy gets a list of the points. This year, James, Kelvin, and Samuel each earn 25 points. After the year, each boy will have to choose the amount of points they want to use. The question asks which child gets the most points. If your child is the choice, then subtract 50 points from the child's grade and use the remainder to determine their point total. Note that Kelvin and James did not have to write their personal points down because they already had to write their scores. Kelvin was supposed to use the 25 points he earned at recess when his turn came. Kelvin wrote his final test which increased his grade. His points total remained the same. James's points total was also the same. The question asks which student got the second-highest point total. This is where Kelvin came in. Kelvin was given only 3 points because he only earned 25 points. Kelvin therefore got no credit. His point total remained the same. So Kelvin's point total was 7. To conclude: Kelvin did not do well in any of his tests\n\nInput: A student in grade 4 has a math teacher. He always uses 4-count counting to do a task. When he counts 1 to 2, the teacher tells him to do another number. If he did 2 numbers, then he would put 3 to 1 instead of 1 to 2. The math teacher told him to only count numbers from 1 to 2 because some children have trouble doing 2-1's and he should get rid of the 2's. Then he would count from 2 to 1. When this happens, he has to check his work because he did not get any points. As James and Kelvin also learn the math worksheets, they also start doing that activity. When James and Kelvin are counting 2-1's, they get 1 point for adding a 1", "answer": "E: car"}

To save $20, and get 10 extra miles per gallon, he would need to save $40 a month. What is Bill's saving plan?\nOutput: Bill's saving plan has a cost of $240: $120/mo=$80$/month=$40=$40\nHe saves 60 cents per month, which amounts to $40 spent per month.  Because Bill needs 60 cents worth of gas per month ($40), then his saving plan saves.80 cents per month, or $80/mo = $240/$240 = $20/mo\nSo the final answer, $40/mo = $40/mo + $0.80 = $80/mo: $40/mo = >>40=160>>160\nSo the final answer for Bill's saving plan of $40/mo is $160.\n\nInput: William started his first job at age 14.

Therefore, his savings plan does not save $192 ($2,000/year).\n\nInput: John worked at an electronics store. He made 20 cents per hour. At this rate, John needs 6 months to save up $1500.

{"text": "Sam went forth, also known as backwards,  A: Reverse B: Backwards C: Back and D: Back\nSo Sam was asking for how many of anything he needed, rather than what he wanted, since A=back and B=back.  He then went forward, by reversing back.  However, A=back and B = forward.  So from a tally, Sam was asking for how far he could travel.  He travelled back to the store, which means he back and forward, thus reversing the direction.  So he traveled backward to his house and turned around instead of going forward.  So he traveled forward to his front door and turned around there instead.  He traveled forward to the store again and turned around there, so he was going forward once again.  So he traveled further than any other way for this process.  Also he went backwards for some reason, because I am unsure for this process.  So forward he went and then turned around, thus getting further than he started.  So he traveled back to the store again and went forward once more.  So he traveled backwards until he had reached the place he started at.  So he traveled the same route twice as far.  He traveled as far as he wanted, since he went a single way first.

How much money did Stephen give to his parents after giving them his $100,000?\nOutput: Stephen gave $100,000 to his parents.\nJames gave $75,000 to his parents so he received $75,000 after Stephen gave $100,00.\nSo the total after all was $100,000+$75,000=<<100,000+$100,000=2075>>2075\nSo the final answer becomes $150,000\n\nInput: The student started his year off by buying a new laptop. His laptop broke down a few weeks into his first year at university. His laptop cost $950. How much money did he save on replacing the laptop compared to buying two new laptops?\nOutput: So the student spent $950.\nHe made $200 by saving $950, so the total cost of buying a laptop was $950 plus $200 to replace his old laptop.\nBecause the total cost before the new laptop was $950, his total cost after it was $950 includes $200 to buy another laptop. So the total cost of the laptop was $950 + $200 = $550.\nSo the student saved $550 and thus $1100 was needed to recover the cost of the new laptop.\nThis is his second laptop. So the total amount he lost was $1150. So the total amount of money he saved in one month was $1100.\nSo Stephen saved $550 by spending $550, which equals $1100.\nSo he gained $1100 and thus saved $1100. The net effect total change in cost to the student was $900.\nSo the final net change for Stephen was $900 > $1100 = $2000\nSo the final answer equals $2000 > $1100 = $5000\nSo he", "answer": "E: tall"}

How much did he lose?\nOutput: He lost the money he just paid off his mortgage by $30,000, but he gained money by selling his old toys and furniture.\nSo John now has $30,000+new house = $<<30,000+new.>>30\nJohn lost $30,000, now he has $30,000 + $30,000 new house = $<<30K-new>>30\n$<<30K-new>30\nSo the final answer was $30,000\n\nInput: John and his wife are separated and have been a couple for 17 years.

{"text": "The old barn was beyond repair and they had to destroy it or else they would be buried beneath it.\nThey needed to raise the money before they could build a new barn. The money was raised by selling old barn materials, with $200 being the largest expense by far. The rest would all come from donations by the town. Since they had to destroy the old barn, they had to build the new barn in the same exact spot. Since there are no plans for a new barn, their next best option is to find someone to build them a new barn. The town will send someone to build them a barn if they contribute 25% of their money for building materials.\nThe town did not know about their old barn being so old. The only reason they found it was because the town has had a barn for many years and no one had ever thought about demolishing it. Therefore, they will not have to pay the people for their work before they were actually needed.\nSince the new barn would be built under the old barn, the town will no longer need the money they raised for the old barn. The new barn will actually make money to help pay for the town\u2019s other needs.\nSince the town was forced to demolish the barn because they made a mistake and not having a new barn, the town will still need to build a new barn after they pay the people for their construction.\nThe town needs the money and the town wants $$$. They can both get what they want by helping the town, which means they would benefit from each others help.

What will you choose?\nOutput: It would be cheaper to buy a $2000 car. He will go around asking people if they have a $2000 car they would like to sell. He will then pick the car he wants from this selection. The car he buys will cost $500. If that car is his, he will pay $500+$1,000 = $<<$500*1,000=10>>10 cars.\nOutput: If $1200 is the total amount of cars he needs, then he will buy 1200 cars for $1250.\nSince car #1250 has a market value of $10,000, he cannot decide whether to buy 1250 cars or not. Since those cars have market values of $60 and $80, do $60 and $80 get the choice. If not, can the $60 and $80 buy the 1250 cars? Or must both $60 and $80 give the choice? Either way, the $60 and $160 will get the car.\nOutput: He can either buy 1250 cars for $1200 or $1,000 cars for $1,000 or 2000 cars for $5,000. Both he needs $1200 cars from people who have $4000+2000 cars, so he will need to find people who have $4000. (Note: It would be easier and cheaper just to buy an old car with $4000.) He will then go and ask those people if they want their car. Those people will then tell him their true market value, if any. If the true market value of the car is less than $2000, then the $60 has the choice of buying the car ($200 is the market value of cars if the person is giving the option). If the true market value is above $2000, then $80 has the choice of buying all 1250 cars ($200 is the market values of cars if they're giving the option).\nBy going around and asking people about their price, he will be able to buy a car at the best price. He will have a $5,000 difference between prices that he would then pay for cars. He will then buy 2000 cars at $5,000 and spend $5,000", "answer": "E: surf net"}

James spent $40 on video games while Sam spent $30 on new shoes. James enjoyed his video games more than Sam. James has 20 more games than Sam, so Sam will finish paying for his video games before James does.

How much money will $1,000 make?\nOutput: There are 4 cars. After deducting $200 from all four cars, the total cost in items alone is $1,250. There is still $80 left. After deducting $100 from each individual item from the above, the total price of the cars is $1,400.\nThe friend's father has $850 left. She will need this amount to get him from $700 in debt to zero. Assuming a $50 a car repair fee, her plan is to add $200 to the cars at a time in order to save $100. This $100 a day is divided between two cars - the friend's car and her father's car. She decides to spend $50 a day, $50 a week, and $50 a month on gas for the three cars to get them to zero. Therefore, total cost of fixing the cars will be $800 in four weeks and $100 per day.\nAfter this, she will have $200 a month on her spending budget. However, she will be able to save $700. Therefore, her plan is to pay off the debt by the end of next year. Therefore, her total plan is $800 = 787/1000 = 787/1000 dollars.\nSo her plan makes $1,000 per month. It turns out that since she is paying off the debt, she doesn't need more in order to save money. Therefore, her plan worked. However, since she had a budget, she would have paid off the car after four months or $80 a day. Therefore, $800 a month is still a lot of $, with which she could have bought more food. Her plan worked well, but it would have been even better with a budget instead. It's the person with a budget who makes the plan work.\nSo the total answer is 787", "answer": "A: injuries"}

{"text": "Where can you get a small dog?\nKelvin is taking a long walk on the beach with his four-legged friend. Samuel finds an old fence and hooks it to a car. The dog follows Kelvin with his tail. Kelvin wants to reward the dog with a small bite. How should he treat the dog? How will this benefit the dog physically or emotionally?\nOutput: There are two physical methods to treat a dog when on a leash. The first is to grab the dog\u2019s collar tightly by the ears and pull it, which will often send the dog fleeing towards a nearby pet or object. The second method is to pick the dog up by its tail and pull it, which is called \u201clead tugging\u201d and can be less painful. Both are effective in stimulating a friendly, happy behavior, but lead tugging can result in the dog falling behind the leash. So Kelvin can reward the dog by giving it a treat or a high-five. This will make the dog feel appreciated and helps him maintain his good behavior.\nSo the final question is 131\n\nInput: The mayor has a program to give away bicycles to students aged 13 to 18.

{"text": "Would a volunteer do this? (a) Yes!  If a volunteer milked a cow, she would be paid the $240 that I divided by two (2/3).  A volunteer would earn $240/2 = $<<240+2= $336>$336 in milk\nIf I gave $112/2 = $336 to the volunteer and she decided not to take the milk then she would lose the $112/2 because she gave it to someone else. So if I gave $112/5 = $336 to the same person as I did the $112/2 or $112/5 - $112/2 = ~$3.56. So she would have to spend ~$3.56 to milk the cow\nSince I gave $112/3 = $336 to the cow, I divided the $56/2 by 2 = 1/5 = $12, so the cow's share came to $16.60 and she made $16.60/2 = $764.60 from the $112/2. So the cow made $4 more than she lost.

Bill saved the other half of this amount from his own check and then saved the left overs for himself. How much was left after expenses for these items?\nOutput\nA = 2/4 $50\nB = 1/2 $50\nC = $50\nD = $50\nE = $50\n\nInput: $200 was given to Steve and his wife. Steve then spent half of the money $100 on a lunch buffet so it would be less expensive for his family. Steve\u2019s wife had leftovers to eat after her lunch, so she spent the leftover money on a bottle of wine. Does this help their household budget?\nOutput: Not really. Steve could have spent $100 on a lunch, and it would be less expensive than having Bill\u2019s check with $200 leftover in it \u2013 in which case he could have spent it for groceries (not lunch).\nTherefore, the money was less economical for the family. In addition, the additional check does not help Bill\u2019s family budget, as $100 would be less costly then $200. Therefore, the $200 that was given to Steve and the $100 that Steve spent is only partially economical for the family and has no influence on their budget.  Therefore, the final answer to this question is no\n\nInput: Bill\u2019s rent was $50 a month. Therefore, it takes $50 a month to pay for Steve\u2019s rent. If Steve moved out, how much money will he need before he is forced to move in with his parents?\nOutput: He has about $75 more than he left when he moved in with his parents.", "answer": "B: filing cabinet"}

As it approached 12:00 am the girls met at 11:00 pm to clean the place up for the date. If they started cleaning now, they would have 2 hours to clean the house, which would cost 1 hour. If the girls started at 10:00 pm they would have 10 hours to clean. They would save this time if they paid $30 each for one bag. The cost of a bag is $6.00, so how much time do the girls need to save?\nOutput: The cost of a bag of weed is $6.00 / 10 hours = $<<6.00/10=20>>20 hours\nIf we do not start at 10:00 pm, and only start at 10:00 am, they will need 20 hours to clean. The total time is $10 = $2, 20 hours\nSo the final answer would be $2 per hour = $<<20/2 = 50>>50 minutes\nIf there were four girls sleeping together, which two were sleeping with the girls who were working on the date, what would happen if they had too much to drink? Would everyone who was working on the date have to leave as well?\nOutput: If there were four girls sleeping with the girls who cleaned the place, then at the conclusion of the date, they would all have to leave together. No one would get to stay later than the other work group would have.\nSo the $0/10 is 50 * 4 = $150 which is $<<200+150=700>>700\nSo the total would be $700/4 = >>700/4 = $200\nSo at the conclusion of the night, they would have all to leave\nBut where does the money that was taken from the bag go?\nOutput: The money goes to whoever is working the job that night\n\nInput:The two people decide to visit a friend of their wives.

But if you decide to give up on reading A before reading book N, you will not finish book N at all. So in both cases you finish the book you start halfway through earlier than if you had read the whole book when you had it available.\nSo in the first case, you have a greater % of starting the book than your usual starting %.

If you want the fish to swim as far as possible, the temperature should be 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If the fish is caught using a casting rod, make sure the surface temperature is 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If you plan on using a trolling rod, make sure it will move the fish as much as possible. If you plan on catching fish with a swimming rod then using a cast rod would be helpful. If you plan on fishing using an underwater rod then using a trolled rod would also be helpful.\nOutput: If you use B to fish as far as possible and use C for casting then you will catch trout at the rate shown at the top of this list but not at all if you use A,C, or D\nInput: In the winter, when the lake is at its deepest, temperatures are -4 degrees Fahrenheit. In other weather systems, such as sunny days in the Midwest, the temperature is usually 1-3 degrees Fahrenheit above freezing. If you use an underwater rod or even use a trolled rod to fish, then the surface temperature will actually be 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the air temperature would be.

If the farmer sells three cows, he will get $1000 out of each animal and keep the rest for himself. If he sells all five cows, he will get a total of $3000 which will be divided between farmers. Which farmer makes the most money?\nOutput: All five cows make $1500. The farmer's family makes $3000.\nThe farmer makes $1500, since he received $1000 from each cow.

John spent $350 on the food for the staff. He has about $10 of which he can keep. How much will John keep?\nOutput: John gave $350, so he has $10 left.\nChris spent $250 from his $350. He has $20 of which he can keep or he can use it to get clothes for his own daughter from the closet. His daughter is 7 and Chris wants to get her some \"cool\" clothes to match her older brothers, so he used the $20 to get clothes for her.\nSo Chris now has $20+<10$=$400>20 = $<<250\u2212$400=120>>120 each.\nSo the next step is for Chris to pay for the rest of the money at work. Maybe a raise. The employees at his new job have been in the company for a year and he will offer them his salary or the minimum wage in the company's area to keep them. If he offers his new salary, Chris wants to find out if he can negotiate on benefits, or better pay. If he does, he will negotiate on the raise and benefits. If he cannot, he will probably take the paycut for a year to save money. So now Chris has $20+10-$400=$<<20-10=80>>80$\nSo Chris has $80 left. His original plan was for him to buy his old clothes for his daughter. So now Chris can use some of his $20 to buy some clothes for his own daughter. So Chris can buy clothes for his kid for his birthday next month. So Chris now has more than $20 to spend on getting his daughter clothes. So Chris spends $20 and buys a gift for his daughter. So Chris now has $40 to spend on getting his own daughter clothes. So Chris buys clothes for his daughter and keeps $40 of his new money\nSo the next step for Chris was to pay off the $40.\nSo Chris paid off the $40 with $40 left over.\nSo the next question is, Is Chris earning $140 at work?\nTherefore, the answer is no, he is not earning", "answer": "B: better job"}

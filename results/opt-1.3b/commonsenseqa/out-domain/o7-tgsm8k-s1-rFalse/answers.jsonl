For example, the components will have to maintain their integrity for at least 20,000 hours or 5,500 miles, whichever comes first. As a result, you should make the assumption that the entire machine is subject to periodic wear and tear. In an engineering problem where there is only a single part that is subject to maintenance, your analysis should be more generalized and make the assumption that the components are not subject to periodic wear and, therefore, are unaffected by the wear.  Suppose that your parts are all of a given brand and all have the same operating specifications. For example, your parts have the same design, manufacturer, and manufacturing process. How much would the parts cost if they were all the same size, manufactured in the same batch, and were all subject to the same wear and tear? If the part has an operating life of 3 years or 5,000 hours, suppose that the parts that are not affected by wear and tear cost 60% less than the parts that have undergone 10,000 hours or 3,500 hours of regular maintenance.

Write a brief essay about how you feel about toxic stress.\n\nSolution:\n1. I think that toxic stress is one of the hardest kinds of stress to deal with because it can harm your health but it also can ruin your life forever. For example, toxic stress may make you feel like you don't need to study anymore because there is so much trouble. It is one of the most harmful kind of stress because it can make you suicidal, anxious, and depressed. Another toxic stress I think is bad is chemical stress because it is because you are exposed to harmful chemicals in your environment and you are not taught how to minimize the effects from such stress.\n\nThe best way to deal with toxic stress is to control it. Toxic stress can be dangerous because it can cause your body to be physically painful or you may have mental problems. When I go to school, I try my best to learn how to control it, even if I can't eliminate it completely.\n\nI am going to study about chemical effects. The best way to control toxic stress is by staying inside the room with the television. If you are allowed to spend time outside, that will also allow you to have some positive stress.\nAnother option for controlling toxic stress is to learn about environmental and social conditioning and what can you do to minimize the effect of such stress. There is a scientific study about environmental exposure and mental illness from the 1970's. In the experiment, 70 women with major depressive disorder were exposed to a toxic mix of chemicals for three days. The chemicals were found to cause long-term brain damage which affects their emotional stability.\n2. Explain the idea of psychological self-protection or self-protection.\nSolution:\nMany of the things you see around you in society, especially in high schools is a form of self-protection. It is important to understand how your environment influences your emotional safety, self-esteem, and self-care. A good way to do so is to be aware what words you use to describe yourself, how you spend your time, and how you think about", "answer": "B: being annoyed"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput:The car has a top speed of 115 miles per hour and a top torque of 400,000 pounds.  The top speed makes the car more dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.  The top torque is why pedestrians are more likely to walk near the top speed and why motorcyclists are more likely to ride toward the torque.  If the car is going around a corner, the top speed is less important than the torque.  The car is twice as likely to be hit by the bus when the driver is travelling at a lower speed.  The best way to cut down on pedestrian deaths is to reduce the top speed.  If the top speed of a bus is only 60 miles an hour, it would cost $40,000 to $60,000 for a bus to reduce the top speed without significantly raising the top speed.\nOutput: A\nThe car is twice as likely for pedestrians to be hit when the speed is 30 miles per hour or less. The best way to reduce automobile fatalities is to improve pedestrian crossing signals.  The maximum amount of time any pedestrian should take to cross a street is 1/3 of a second.  The more time pedestrians spend crossing a street, the riskier it is for them to get hit by a motorist.  The maximum amount is 0.25 seconds.\n\nInput: How many times does the car change lanes with in a couple hundred meters?\nOutput: 12\nInput: The answer is A:\nInput: The answer would be 1:10,000\nOutput: A\nInput: 5:50,000\nOutput: B\n\nInput: A woman was arrested for giving her 16-year-old son a sexually inappropriate kiss.

A lot of people look at this graph and they have no idea what values I am looking at.  The graph is pretty straight with all values right.  However, there is an x-axis which has the negative value.  The positive, z-axis has the positive value and the negative, x-axis has the negative value. It is almost impossible to tell which direction is which without looking at the data.  The only way I can tell which way was that an average of the two side x-axes was 1.0.

On paper, the red dot represents the graph and the green dot represents the money.  Also on paper, the red line represents an average of the points on the graph.  That is, the red line represents averages of each activity.\nThe green line represents a graph of money spent in each subject.  That is, at the end of the year, money has been spent on every activity.  However, at the beginning of the year, all money was spent on each activity, so the ratio of money spent on each activity relative to the budget was 0 by the end of the year.\nIn the graph, the red line represents activity 1, and the green line represents activity 3.  However in the graph, when someone looks at money spent on activity 3 (this would be you), they would see a red circle.  The red circle represents money spent on activity 3.

We'll start by cutting out the carbon atoms in the different shapes. We'll also be adding in atoms in various weights, as well as the heavier graphite atoms. For each graphite atom that is turned in, we'll be keeping a note about what it is.\nIn the middle of your graphite cube, take your graphite out and put it down on a piece of paper. Take a pen or pencil and mark out every carbon atom on the graphite cube. When you're done, mark the carbon atoms along all their edges. Finally, you have to mark the carbon atom along a line that is perpendicular to the two sides of the graphite cube.\nRemember that each carbon atom has three electrons. Each carbon atom has an orbitals, which are the four electrons that orbit around the carbon atom.\nWhen you're in the middle of your graphit cube, you can add an electron to each of the three outer carbon atoms, with the exception that we won't add a fourth electron, because that would destroy the carbon bond with the one on the middle. It can be the electron is on the carbon atom that is closest to the center of the graphite, on the same orbitals, so that should do just fine.\nNow, take your graphite back to your writing station and write a paragraph explaining the graphite atoms.", "answer": "D: contaminated"}

{"text": "1,100\n\nInput: What is a good way to measure the amount of time that elapses between two consecutive tasks? This question is also frequently asked at the end of an exam. Answer:  Time is a measure of the amount of different stimuli that the mind can receive before a response is possible.  Therefore the amount of time elapsed between tasks could also be referred to as the time lag between a task and its consequences.  The time lag between two consecutive inputs could also be considered to be a measure of the distance that is traveled by the subject between the two actions.  The time lag in this case can occur either during the processing of the input, the time from the time the subject is presented with the input until the subject is aware of its consequences, or shortly after the completion of the inputs.  The time lag depends on both the amount of information available to the subject and the number of stimuli present.\nOutput: 1,500\n\nInput: Which type of food are better for dogs: a) raw meat or b) cooked steak?\nOutput: 6,200\n\nInput: What happens when a dog is exposed to different colors of light and it decides which colors mean its safe to eat?\nOutput: 3,400\n\nOutput: Which type of food were the cows fed and how many calories were they provided with that food?\nOutput: 3.800\n\nInput:How many different ways can you take a spoon and then put it in the hole of a straw?

No one ever said that you couldn't have multiple answers. It's allowed.\n2. If we had to do it this way, we would just assign random numbers to each question so we could have multiple answers without having to split it into multiple questions, which I think is a lot worse.\n3. If we could assign numbers to each question, then every other answer would be a multiple choice answer in my opinion.\n4. If you give an example, we could assign the percentage answer (answer in bold) to each question and have the same problem. The problem is just getting rid of the question so the answer is in bold.\n\nI think that's a great idea! I just did a project in this style, so I've been thinking of how to handle multiple answers. I've decided that each is going to get one answer and we just have to put the percentage in parentheses. If someone wants to explain why they think it's better or a different way, I'm open to it.\n\nI think it's better for the kids and teachers to have the option, but the option isn't always better than multiple choice - it's just giving a choice.\nWhen I was teaching my classroom, we were asked to do a multiple choice on math. Every student chose the answer, but the teacher gave us a percentage answer.\nI told my students they would have to do the same thing on their final for the assignment. We made sure that each one of us had a \"pass grade.\" Because some students went so far out on an answer or had to check something off multiple times, it was important to make sure that", "answer": "D: legal fees"}

{"text": "Thank You A, D, C, E\n\nInput:Mary had 89 stickers. She used 3 large stickers and 7 stickers each to six other pages of her journal and then she put them all on the end of her page. Each page was labeled with the stickers. How many stickers does she have remaining?\nOutput : 44\n\nComments:\nFirst, a little info on this problem:\nI. Multiple choice questions are never easy. For instance, suppose we need to solve a multiplication fact in which the answer would be 0.9 but the problem has multiple ways to solve the problem. These multiple ways are always less than the answer given by the first way, or at least they should be. For example, suppose I had 100 x's divided by 100=1.0. The second way to solve this is zero =2.0 and also the second solution to be less than the first solution. So, if we multiply by 100=2.0, would they add up to 0.9, or not? This is a common question we will need to solve on any test we take.\n\nII. If you have a set number of pages of a problem in your textbook, but you are not sure how many pages that is, it is always good to ask the instructors about it. The more page-specific information the instructors think they are going to need from test takers, the less time this information will consume for them. As an example, the instructor might need to tell new students that there are two ways they can read a given question, one method which can tell them whether or not a particular number is one, and the other method which only tells them whether the number is within a particular range of one, instead of whether it is one. This could take up a large amount of their time to have the new students memorize. You will also want to know the teacher\u2019s ideas about different ways of doing this problem so you know what other students have done in class and what works for them. I. You can also ask teachers here about how to solve a multiple choice problem if you have never done it before.\n\nIII. Here are some tips I have for getting through more than one question on the test: 1) Keep your answer to under 15 words or so; 2) don\u2019t make any mistakes; 3) pay special attention to your wording and spelling; 3) ask a teacher if they will give you extra minutes if you fail a multiple choice question (", "answer": "D: say you're welcome"}

The third rule is that you should test out your own hypothesis by seeing how other people test theirs.  The fourth rule is that you should ask \"What about if it's a myth?\" to determine if you should believe it.  The fifth rule is that you should be sure of a hypothesis before you test it.\nThe sixth rule is that you should never have too many hypotheses and that a hypothesis should always be supported by enough evidence to justify a decision to try it.\nThe seventh rule states that only experiments that show that you are right should be considered valuable.  The eighth rule states that any experiment that produces nothing more than the opposite of your conclusion is worthless.\nThe ninth rule states that everything worth making should always be repeated.  The ten rule is \"Any experiment that does not produce a false negative is worthless.\"\nThe eleventh rule states that any experiment with a false positive is not worth the paper it is printed on.\nThe twelfth rule states that in science, you test hypotheses before you test methods.\nThe thirteenth rule states that even if someone comes up with a complete solution, they should still repeat a test until they find out why the problem is not causing the problem.\nThe fourteenth rule is that the conclusion is always justified if and only if you don't change your method of testing or of finding out the hypothesis is correct.\n\n1\n\nAnswers:\n\nInput:Mary had 89 stickers.

{"text": "4\n\nIn many situations the key to understanding a child requires insight into the child's behavior.\nOne of the easiest ways for parents to understand and guide their children is to look at their behavior. It is not always easy to see if your child has a good or bad behavior. Parents often have to do things in the moments of chaos without realizing it or noticing it. So the key to knowing about a childs behavior is understanding what they are thinking and feeling.\n\nBehavior can start developing in the toddler years, so it is essential for parents to understand their child first and then take action to direct and guide their child. Parents can watch television, play games on the computer or go outside and walk their children around. If behavior is difficult to understand, parents should look for explanations or explanations that do not require their involvement. Parents should ask their child about the behavior, if their child does not feel comfortable giving an account. Children who have more social support often have a harder time explaining their behavior. Also if a child is angry a parent may not be aware of the cause, their child may be more likely to blame another parent. This will result in more anger and frustration in the situation.\nParent\u2019s should be aware of their child's strengths and weaknesses and strive to create opportunities for their child so that he can develop positive behaviors. Parents should not expect their child to be perfect but rather they should try to be consistent. Children need consistency at the young age so that they learn from mistakes. Some common ways to increase consistency include: using toys that make it fun to play with, getting outside to play when play is difficult and teaching children how to be patient and respectful to one another. Helping teach children how to play with others and being positive is really important to the overall development of a child. Some common mistakes that parents make in helping their children to behave:\n-They expect their children to do the work themselves, when in reality they are making assumptions about each other, parents and siblings.\n- Parent's do not trust each other, or they fear criticism.\n-Parents are too trusting.\n-Children are told exactly what and where are allowed to sit, move or touch.\n-Parents are not strict enough.\nSome children may also have a behavioral need to vent their needs on the outside. Some examples would be when they need their hands held or want to be carried, or when they are upset and can\u2019t control their feelings and needs. Parents should be very careful not to", "answer": "C: control children"}

Zach\u2019s teammates picked up the ball and began kicking it, but Zach had already kicked it a maximum of 10 times. Zach was worried until one of his teammates passed the ball and kicked it a second time. Zach was overjoyed at this turn of events, but his teammates were not too convinced. They suggested that Zach kick it again if he had no way to catch the ball. Zach obliged, but instead of getting another kick, he got another kick. At this point Zach felt like he really had to score a goal. Zach did exactly that, running all the way down the field to goal, kicking the ball five times in a row. Zach thought he\u2019d best score another goal if the goal kept in the end zone, or if it came within his goal post. Zach kicked the ball towards goal and scored two touchdowns! Zach played a brilliant game, but he didn\u2019t think the team had earned at least one point. However, Zach was right. The team had scored enough points to tie the league record (an average of 8.84 a game). Zach\u2019s teammates were excited for this great achievement.

The students were to write about a person who they felt deserved to have his life story told and to do so with care and compassion.\n\nThe students must write an essay about a teacher whom they love for what they do. The teacher will be asked to pick a student or a couple of students whom they feel have a good work ethic. The teacher will also be asked to choose a child who could not attend the class because of extenuating circumstances. The teacher may pick a student of their own choosing.\n\nThe teacher chooses which two classes will receive their essays. Each class has a different theme to work with as well as a different student or couple whom they would like to hear the story from. Every effort will be made to select students and couples that will be able to attend the class. It is important that students know the topic within their class and choose a topic that both they and the teacher feel is a \u201cfavor to the kids and to the teacher\u201d.\n\nThe students and teachers will communicate through the prompt. The assignment will be due tomorrow at 1 p.m. Students, teachers and their partner(s) should work on their assignment in the days leading up to the due date. In the beginning of the assignment, students, teachers and their partner will talk about the topic and the teachers will ask about the themes that the students and their partners are working on.\n\nA student wrote, \u201cI have always loved my mom and I still do every day.

Her friend asked her: \u201cwhy? I think that after 10 years you only have one thing to offer: your reputation.\u201d\nOutput: \u201cI disagree. If you are a really good employee who knows you are an amazing employee, then employers tend to overlook one bad thing: your lack of experience which leads to their feeling that you have been around. Then they do their research about you. Then they take an in depth look at the way you treat people and the quality of the product you make. Then they know that you are dedicated, reliable, and a good worker. You can have all of the qualifications in the world and your resume will have nothing to do with what the employer can actually do for his business. So if you want to be remembered as an employee that the employer really loves, here are my suggestions to make yourself memorable: - Keep a notebook with a pen, notebook paper, and notepad nearby and have a pen on the table for you to write down requests you get. - Keep a pen on hand 24 hours a day, so that you are always close to your employees. - Keep in mind that no matter how good you are, your employer will always have another person to work for. In fact, one of the most difficult things to do is to find the quality of employees you will actually keep for more than a few months to years. After a year or two, your employer will be so well satisfied with the experience they have had through you that they will want to add you as a permanent employee. Then they will begin offering bonuses. By then, you will have already earned a reputation as someone who is extremely hard working and can be relied on. - Don't be so confident in your company that your own attitude is likeable!- Don't be that guy that comes in late. - Know that no matter how much the work you do will be less than half of your actual time with the employer. - No matter what you try, if you keep your cool, and you have a good attitude - your boss will love you!", "answer": "A: nebraska"}

When I walk in he\u2019s not there. I go to get a chair to hold up with and my chair falls. I think I should have him wait for the next class, but instead I find him hiding in a corner. I go to ask him how he got lost. He says he didn\u2019t know where he was going.

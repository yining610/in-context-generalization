For example, the components will have to maintain their integrity for at least 20,000 hours or 5,500 miles, whichever comes first. As a result, you should make the assumption that the entire machine is subject to periodic wear and tear. In an engineering problem where there is only a single part that is subject to maintenance, your analysis should be more generalized and make the assumption that the components are not subject to periodic wear and, therefore, are unaffected by the wear.  Suppose that your parts are all of a given brand and all have the same operating specifications. For example, your parts have the same design, manufacturer, and manufacturing process. How much would the parts cost if they were all the same size, manufactured in the same batch, and were all subject to the same wear and tear? If the part has an operating life of 3 years or 5,000 hours, suppose that the parts that are not affected by wear and tear cost 60% less than the parts that have undergone 10,000 hours or 3,500 hours of regular maintenance.

The engineer decided he would contribute his 50% and let the other two live from the second-bride's side of the family. The teacher tried to use his 50% as well, but the new couple refused to take him, so they hired a lawyer and demanded his 60% and he agreed. Then, the teacher had problems with his 50% because of his job, so that person decided to sell his property for $5000 and pay $5000 with his 20% from the future. Now, there are some problems for the first couple. They have no use for their home because it got demolished by hurricanes. They had to move to a bigger house and now the rent is $500 less each month. What they can do to overcome this trouble is: A: get a new house with same style and same room layout but on a smaller lot so they can have a bigger house with more room for storage and B: apply for a mortgage or else sell their house and build an apartment. C: stay put in their present house, save the $500 and pay the remaining expense by selling a portion of their own property, or they could move to a different home or to a hotel or to a friend's place. D: stay put in their home and live on 10%.<n>Output: A: their house was not finished by disaster, they have too much furniture, they have to change

Write a brief essay about how you feel about toxic stress.<n><n>Solution:<n>1. I think that toxic stress is one of the hardest kinds of stress to deal with because it can harm your health but it also can ruin your life forever. For example, toxic stress may make you feel like you don't need to study anymore because there is so much trouble. It is one of the most harmful kind of stress because it can make you suicidal, anxious, and depressed. Another toxic stress I think is bad is chemical stress because it is because you are exposed to harmful chemicals in your environment and you are not taught how to minimize the effects from such stress.<n><n>The best way to deal with toxic stress is to control it. Toxic stress can be dangerous because it can cause your body to be physically painful or you may have mental problems. When I go to school, I try my best to learn how to control it, even if I can't eliminate it completely.<n><n>I am going to study about chemical effects. The best way to control toxic stress is by staying inside the room with the television. If you are allowed to spend time outside, that will also allow you to have some positive stress.<n>Another option for controlling toxic stress is to learn about environmental and social conditioning and what can you do to minimize the effect of such stress. There is a scientific study about environmental exposure and mental illness from the 1970's. In the experiment, 70 women with major depressive disorder were exposed to a toxic mix of chemicals for three days. The chemicals were found to cause long-term brain damage which affects their emotional stability.<n>2. Explain the idea of psychological self-protection or self-protection.<n>Solution:<n>Many of the things you see around you in society, especially in high schools is a form of self-protection. It is important to understand how your environment influences your emotional safety, self-esteem, and self-care. A good way to do so is to be aware what words you use to describe yourself, how you spend your time, and how you think about

Choices:  A: asia B: southern hemisphere C: planet D: east E: earth<n>Output:		 Mars<n><n>Input: How do you know what an ocean is? There are many types of ocean, so you can’t know what an ocean is without being able to find out what each has in it. Some oceans have water, some have sand, some have plants, some have rocks, some have algae, etc. Some oceans are bigger than others, some are small. Some ocean are wet and some are dry. What ocean do you know the least about? What ocean does the most? And: What ocean do you know best about?<n>Output: The ocean with the least variety = the ocean you should have gone to.<n><n>Note: We will look at different types of ocean in the next lesson. To learn about sea level change, this lesson should be followed up with the lesson “What makes a sea?” (see the second lesson of the series for that). In the second lesson, we’ll look at three oceans, one freshwater, one ocean that contains salt and one other that doesn’t, and try to figure out what is in the saltwater ocean and in the other two and what happens when they’re salty or not salty.<n><n>NOTE: A few weeks ago, we didn’t think to do this problem, maybe we shouldn’t do the next one too soon. Maybe next time we can be better prepared when we have to look at different types of oceans. If you have to use this problem, make sure you do it well. Let us know how this problem is solved. We’d be interested to hear about it.<n><n>NOTE: Some materials are listed in this lesson using the new, full lesson style. We recommend using the old (old format) lesson style (as it is the format most common in school here, and is the format most commonly used by most teachers in our classes).<n><n>What is the name of the island in the Mediterranean Sea? There are five continents on earth: earth, moon, water, earth again, and space.<n><n>In this lesson, you’ll do the following:<n><n>1. Use all of the five different oceans’ pictures to answer a question, and then do the same question with the name of a planet and describe the pictures based on the continents.<n>2. Take the word “ocean” from your picture and write it somewhere in your answer.<n>3. Read a passage to yourself about how the continents are connected and

The top speed makes the car more dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.  The top torque is why pedestrians are more likely to walk near the top speed and why motorcyclists are more likely to ride toward the torque.  If the car is going around a corner, the top speed is less important than the torque.  The car is twice as likely to be hit by the bus when the driver is travelling at a lower speed.  The best way to cut down on pedestrian deaths is to reduce the top speed.  If the top speed of a bus is only 60 miles an hour, it would cost $40,000 to $60,000 for a bus to reduce the top speed without significantly raising the top speed.<n>Output: A<n>The car is twice as likely for pedestrians to be hit when the speed is 30 miles per hour or less. The best way to reduce automobile fatalities is to improve pedestrian crossing signals.  The maximum amount of time any pedestrian should take to cross a street is 1/3 of a second.  The more time pedestrians spend crossing a street, the riskier it is for them to get hit by a motorist.

We'll start by cutting out the carbon atoms in the different shapes. We'll also be adding in atoms in various weights, as well as the heavier graphite atoms. For each graphite atom that is turned in, we'll be keeping a note about what it is.<n>In the middle of your graphite cube, take your graphite out and put it down on a piece of paper. Take a pen or pencil and mark out every carbon atom on the graphite cube. When you're done, mark the carbon atoms along all their edges. Finally, you have to mark the carbon atom along a line that is perpendicular to the two sides of the graphite cube.<n>Remember that each carbon atom has three electrons. Each carbon atom has an orbitals, which are the four electrons that orbit around the carbon atom.<n>When you're in the middle of your graphit cube, you can add an electron to each of the three outer carbon atoms, with the exception that we won't add a fourth electron, because that would destroy the carbon bond with the one on the middle. It can be the electron is on the carbon atom that is closest to the center of the graphite, on the same orbitals, so that should do just fine.<n>Now, take your graphite back to your writing station and write a paragraph explaining the graphite atoms.

This question is also frequently asked at the end of an exam. Answer:  Time is a measure of the amount of different stimuli that the mind can receive before a response is possible.  Therefore the amount of time elapsed between tasks could also be referred to as the time lag between a task and its consequences.  The time lag between two consecutive inputs could also be considered to be a measure of the distance that is traveled by the subject between the two actions.  The time lag in this case can occur either during the processing of the input, the time from the time the subject is presented with the input until the subject is aware of its consequences, or shortly after the completion of the inputs.  The time lag depends on both the amount of information available to the subject and the number of stimuli present.<n>Output: 1,500<n><n>Input: Which type of food are better for dogs: a) raw meat or b) cooked steak?<n>Output: 6,200<n><n>Input: What happens when a dog is exposed to different colors of light and it decides which colors mean its safe to eat?<n>Output: 3,400<n><n>Output: Which type of food were the cows fed and how many calories were they provided with that food?<n>Output: 3.800<n><n>Input:How many different ways can you take a spoon and then put it in the hole of a straw?

No one ever said that you couldn't have multiple answers. It's allowed.<n>2. If we had to do it this way, we would just assign random numbers to each question so we could have multiple answers without having to split it into multiple questions, which I think is a lot worse.<n>3. If we could assign numbers to each question, then every other answer would be a multiple choice answer in my opinion.<n>4. If you give an example, we could assign the percentage answer (answer in bold) to each question and have the same problem.

I just did a project in this style, so I've been thinking of how to handle multiple answers. I've decided that each is going to get one answer and we just have to put the percentage in parentheses.

Every student chose the answer, but the teacher gave us a percentage answer.<n>I told my students they would have to do the same thing on their final for the assignment. We made sure that each one of us had a "pass grade." Because some students went so far out on an answer or had to check something off multiple times, it was important to make sure that

How many stickers does she have remaining?<n>Output : 44<n><n>Comments:<n>First, a little info on this problem:<n>I. Multiple choice questions are never easy. For instance, suppose we need to solve a multiplication fact in which the answer would be 0.9 but the problem has multiple ways to solve the problem. These multiple ways are always less than the answer given by the first way, or at least they should be. For example, suppose I had 100 x's divided by 100=1.0. The second way to solve this is zero =2.0 and also the second solution to be less than the first solution. So, if we multiply by 100=2.0, would they add up to 0.9, or not? This is a common question we will need to solve on any test we take.<n><n>II. If you have a set number of pages of a problem in your textbook, but you are not sure how many pages that is, it is always good to ask the instructors about it. The more page-specific information the instructors think they are going to need from test takers, the less time this information will consume for them. As an example, the instructor might need to tell new students that there are two ways they can read a given question, one method which can tell them whether or not a particular number is one, and the other method which only tells them whether the number is within a particular range of one, instead of whether it is one. This could take up a large amount of their time to have the new students memorize. You will also want to know the teacher’s ideas about different ways of doing this problem so you know what other students have done in class and what works for them. I. You can also ask teachers here about how to solve a multiple choice problem if you have never done it before.<n><n>III. Here are some tips I have for getting through more than one question on the test: 1) Keep your answer to under 15 words or so; 2) don’t make any mistakes; 3) pay special attention to your wording and spelling; 3) ask a teacher if they will give you extra minutes if you fail a multiple choice question (

What I would do if I didn't have a list of things to work on is keep a checklist of things that I don't need to remember, even if they are little things. I guess I would write them as they come to mind, but don't give yourself any pressure to remember them all. Just keep thinking of your habits and start with things that don't require a lot of thought.<n><n>There's a lot of math

The most obvious answer is that the reward money and hurt feelings were both right choices, as they both have the highest impact on Sean being found out. The problem with the choices "B" and "C" is that they were all really wrong. There is no other "C" option that actually makes sense, because there are no wrong answers. Even if he was found out, he would feel hurt feelings and receive some money. The only options that are "right" are the "Hurt Feelings" option and the "Promise Money" option, because the rest of the choices are just wrong.<n><n>Which one of the following is not a correct answer?<n><n>(1) The body.<n><n>(2) Helping others (as opposed to helping yourself).<n><n>(3) The problem with C.<n><n>(4) None of the above.<n><n>Atheism is NOT an incorrect answer.

Then he decides to go out for a beer. He decides to go out for wine instead. The first round takes 20 minutes and he estimates 2 beers to be worth about 1-2 beers.  From the wine he feels more refreshed.  So he can continue with his night and doesn't want to quit.  Round 3 takes an hour and a half. He estimates 6-8 wine bottles to be worth about 1 beer.  He estimates he spent a total of 20 minutes talking and sipping. Round 4 takes at least an hour and a half because he has to drink enough to reach his goal.  He estimates he spend 2-3 hours at the party.  Round 5 is supposed to take him 2-3 hours.  The man has decided to continue with the evening drinking and not take his training as seriously. Round 6 estimates he is tired. He is going to hit his goal and return for final round.  He estimates around 2-5 beers worth an extra 20 minutes on the night.  He estimates around 40 wines to an extra 60 minutes he spends at the party. Round 7 is the toughest and takes at most 1 hour. The man estimated this round to take almost 2 hours.  He estimated the time it took him to go from beer to wine to wine to wine to beer to beer to wine to wine and beer to wine to beer to wine to beer. Round 8 involves no walking and has a better estimate of round time than the previous round.  That is why round 8 is not round 4 and 5.  His final estimate takes at least 2-3 hours. Round 9 estimates 4 hours. The man did not train for 5 rounds, he just did his workout for 2 rounds. The last 3 rounds (including the bonus round) are not round 10.  Round 10 is supposed to take 2 hours and a half as he goes from beer to wine to beer and back to wine.. It took the man 11-12 hours.  The only rounds over 3 hours were round 8 and 9. He estimated he lost over 2 hours in lost.  Round 9 only has him spending more than 2 hours at the party and round 10 only estimates 2-5 hours. The man estimated he spent at least an extra 1½ hours talking at the party. Round 11 is supposed to take him back to his starting time. Round 12 is the final round and the

It soon became known as the "teacher on the moon".  She tried to go there on Monday and Tuesday at about 7 o'clock in the morning, but it was usually empty. She would always be the only one up there, sitting on and looking at her computer. When she came to school every day, she would see the teacher and ask him all kinds of questions. It didn't work.  There would always be other students up there. He would tell Mary that she could not go to the moon. Then he would go to the library and read one of these great stories.  Mary was a little sad and said, "Ok, I'll try it!"<n>When Mary was in eighth grade, she had another teacher that had the same rules.

He was the one that told Mary not to go to the moon, that it was a forbidden fruit.  Every day when Mary told the teacher on the moon to stay off the moon, he wanted to help her and tell her that it was okay!  He was always the one asking and telling.  There were so many kids up there.  The teachers on the moon had so many questions for Mary! But she didn't know what to ask them!<n>When Mary was in ninth grade, she had an older teacher that told her

She decides to make a journal for Zach.  He's the boy whose family has decided to stop having kids and their dog got hit by a car.  He would be in third grade this upcoming year.  Zach is also the boy whose parents decide to sell their house and the house is for sale.  Mary puts a sticker on page 17 of Zach's journal and leaves a 2" long note at the tip of the page with a list of things she's been asking Zach these past few weeks.  The note starts with, "Dear Zach:  I was in school today and I asked you how do you know God has a plan for you."  The entire note was left blank.  Zach's dad's answer:  "A. You can ask someone on the street and B. You can ask someone in the church."  The note was marked with a star next to each of the questions.  Zach can find what the answers are by putting the stars on the page using the stickers he's collected so far.  He finds the answers for "Why do you want to be a teacher" and there are a total of 2 stars in this category.  He can also use the stickers he already knows.  He finds the answer for "Why do you think God has a plan for Zach and he hasn't said anything to you."  Zach's mom's answer: "A. God loves Zach like the only child ever should."  The answer is marked with a star.  She uses the stickers she already has to fill in the remaining questions.  She then writes the answers on the next page, "Why would he chose Zach over a lot of other people out there?"  The answer for that question is marked with a star on the second page of Zach's journal. So he can find the answers for those, too.  Zach's dad found a question that was "Why do you think you need God?"  Zach's dad wrote a total of 3 answers and the answers are: a.  because, b.  if so, and c.  I didn't.  Zach gives himself 1 star for all 3 answers.  Mary gave him 1 for "Why do you love basketball so much?" and 2 for "Why do you care about Zach?"  Zach also gives himself 1 star for a full stop and a 1/2 star for another question.  At the end

Sophia's friend takes her hand and whispers, "Sophia, you're not allowed to eat the cookies unless someone brings your food in. It's an unfair thing for your friends to be so generous towards you."  Sophia immediately asks who was helping her and when a second friend asks if Sophia had finished her food, Sophia's first friend tells her that she was finished eating. Sophia doesn't eat her cookie. Her friend takes the cookie to the kitchen and Sophia eats some of it while watching over her shoulder. Sophia then takes her fingers off of her friends hand to eat the rest of her cookie. When she comes from the kitchen looking disappointed, her friend tells her that she only got two pieces, but she wasn't allowed to eat the whole cookie, and that is why she got rid of them from the kitchen. Sophia eats a piece of the cookie as well. Sophia then asks her friend if when she was hungry she said her mom said no. Sophia believes her friend, yet when she comes back from her friends' house and her friend tells her that her mother had said no to Sophia's request, Sophia remembers that it wasn't her first request, and then she thinks about why her mother would say no to her. When she finally comes back from her friend's house and retells her first story to her mother, Sophia learns that both the father and her mother have said that she is not allowed to eat her snack outside of school, so she decided to bring the cookies in and bring them to school, so she would not have to break the rules that her mother and father both have said, but her mother was adamant that Sophia would not eat the cookies by herself, because it was an unfair rule for her sister.  Sophia asks her friend if she told her parents about the snack situation and her friend says that she has told her mom and her mother had told her not to say anything about it. Sofia wants to know why she has to keep any of the snacks when they are at other places in the house, and the friend says that her mom said that they are not allowed to have snacks outside of the house. Sophia believes both her friend and her mother and asks why they can't buy fresh candy or milk or soft drinks while they are at home, and her friend explains that her mom said that those are items they need to buy at the store to last

The goal here was to learn why people can have trouble with waiting in doctors' offices and what makes this so surprising to them.<n><n>Input:The student asked his/her friends several questions. A friend posed the following question:<n><n>"Why is waiting room so hard for us?"<n><n>Input:The questioner’s friend asked several “wait” based questions.

When he was the patient, however, his/her experience was different. In the doctor's office, he found waiting time to be short. He enjoyed the time he spent with the doctor. He also liked it when he had been sick!<n><n>output:Both the Student and his/her teacher know that science classes cover new topics in a way that makes them “hard” to learn.

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n>Output:		 4<n><n>In many situations the key to understanding a child requires insight into the child's behavior.<n>One of the easiest ways for parents to understand and guide their children is to look at their behavior. It is not always easy to see if your child has a good or bad behavior. Parents often have to do things in the moments of chaos without realizing it or noticing it. So the key to knowing about a childs behavior is understanding what they are thinking and feeling.<n><n>Behavior can start developing in the toddler years, so it is essential for parents to understand their child first and then take action to direct and guide their child. Parents can watch television, play games on the computer or go outside and walk their children around. If behavior is difficult to understand, parents should look for explanations or explanations that do not require their involvement. Parents should ask their child about the behavior, if their child does not feel comfortable giving an account. Children who have more social support often have a harder time explaining their behavior. Also if a child is angry a parent may not be aware of the cause, their child may be more likely to blame another parent. This will result in more anger and frustration in the situation.<n>Parent’s should be aware of their child's strengths and weaknesses and strive to create opportunities for their child so that he can develop positive behaviors. Parents should not expect their child to be perfect but rather they should try to be consistent. Children need consistency at the young age so that they learn from mistakes. Some common ways to increase consistency include: using toys that make it fun to play with, getting outside to play when play is difficult and teaching children how to be patient and respectful to one another. Helping teach children how to play with others and being positive is really important to the overall development of a child. Some common mistakes that parents make in helping their children to behave:<n>-They expect their children to do the work themselves, when in reality they are making assumptions about each other, parents and siblings.<n>- Parent's do not trust each other, or they fear criticism.<n>-Parents are too trusting.<n>-Children are told exactly what and where are allowed to sit, move or touch.<n>-Parents are not strict enough.<n>Some children may also have a behavioral need to vent their needs on the outside. Some examples would be when they need their hands held or want to be carried, or when they are upset and can’t control their feelings and needs. Parents should be very careful not to

Zach kicked the ball out of the basket and it went around the board without leaving the goal. Zach’s teammates picked up the ball and began kicking it, but Zach had already kicked it a maximum of 10 times. Zach was worried until one of his teammates passed the ball and kicked it a second time. Zach was overjoyed at this turn of events, but his teammates were not too convinced. They suggested that Zach kick it again if he had no way to catch the ball. Zach obliged, but instead of getting another kick, he got another kick. At this point Zach felt like he really had to score a goal. Zach did exactly that, running all the way down the field to goal, kicking the ball five times in a row. Zach thought he’d best score another goal if the goal kept in the end zone, or if it came within his goal post. Zach kicked the ball towards goal and scored two touchdowns! Zach played a brilliant game, but he didn’t think the team had earned at least one point. However, Zach was right. The team had scored enough points to tie the league record (an average of 8.84 a game). Zach’s teammates were excited for this great achievement. Zach wasn’t as surprised at this turn of events. At this point he had learned the lesson that it is always best to play the game when it’s most enjoyable, for he already learned that lesson. Zach’s teacher, Mrs. Jones, told Zach to not take his friends’ games too seriously and that a victory never comes from winning without playing the game. Mrs. Jones added that a loss comes from losing without allowing yourself some leeway. Zach agreed, and continued to win without thinking about score streaks.<n><n>Input: Max found a $10 bill in the garbage and asked one of his friends for a share. Max paid himself only $2.50.

Her friend asked her: “why? I think that after 10 years you only have one thing to offer: your reputation.”<n>Output: “I disagree. If you are a really good employee who knows you are an amazing employee, then employers tend to overlook one bad thing: your lack of experience which leads to their feeling that you have been around. Then they do their research about you. Then they take an in depth look at the way you treat people and the quality of the product you make. Then they know that you are dedicated, reliable, and a good worker. You can have all of the qualifications in the world and your resume will have nothing to do with what the employer can actually do for his business. So if you want to be remembered as an employee that the employer really loves, here are my suggestions to make yourself memorable: - Keep a notebook with a pen, notebook paper, and notepad nearby and have a pen on the table for you to write down requests you get. - Keep a pen on hand 24 hours a day, so that you are always close to your employees. - Keep in mind that no matter how good you are, your employer will always have another person to work for. In fact, one of the most difficult things to do is to find the quality of employees you will actually keep for more than a few months to years. After a year or two, your employer will be so well satisfied with the experience they have had through you that they will want to add you as a permanent employee. Then they will begin offering bonuses. By then, you will have already earned a reputation as someone who is extremely hard working and can be relied on. - Don't be so confident in your company that your own attitude is likeable!- Don't be that guy that comes in late. - Know that no matter how much the work you do will be less than half of your actual time with the employer. - No matter what you try, if you keep your cool, and you have a good attitude - your boss will love you!

In fact every single person at the store had a different story about why John did not do a “buy now.” The problem was if John “buy now’” he would never get out of the store. John, the store assistant, would get fired and there would be a huge amount of negative publicity about the store. John thought of the fact that if someone actually logged into their Facebook account and signed out of their PayPal account when they went to buy a watch or something off of eBay or one of the sites that has a Facebook login, everything would work out pretty well for him. What he did was he wrote John, the store assistant out of the order for 30 minutes later and he took the watch and put it through the fitting room. John would only ever see the ad, he never signed in to Facebook. In fact, he did the “buy now“ in the fitting room to get out of the store so that it did not get out of hand. He even found a Facebook group called “my life at home.” The Facebook group is more than 6500 members and has nearly 2 000 members. In

If you can’t get him to stick to a schedule then you should limit his movement. The best way to do that is to give him an early finish and a late start if possible. He should then be forced to stay in class for the next ten minutes. Let’s say his class is at 10:55. When that time comes I should be ready and waiting for him on the floor. When I walk in he’s not there. I go to get a chair to hold up with and my chair falls. I think I should have him wait for the next class, but instead I find him hiding in a corner. I go to ask him how he got lost. He says he didn’t know where he was going. I get a picture of him sitting in a corner of the room for the rest of the day and every other day for the next three weeks. One morning I see him at class. He’s not in class. He’ll stay in class for another minute or two before he’ll let me know where he’s going. This happens about four times each day. At the end of the week I ask him how he does it and he always says “it depends on my teacher.” I get a picture of this same scene each week for every teacher in the class. I end up giving him a one-way ticket home and then I drop him off at the airport with my friend who works at the airport. He never comes to class again.<n>Output:<n>A: H<n>B: H<n>A: H<n>G: E<n>D: C<n>C: H  D: C<n>C: A<n>A: H<n>E: C<n>F: E<n>G: D<n>

That would make him able to break the league record as his team is the only one that can score enough points in one night.

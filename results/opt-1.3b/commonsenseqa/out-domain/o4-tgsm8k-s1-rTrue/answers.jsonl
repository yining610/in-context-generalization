{"text": "Sammy goes to the populated area where there are lots of shops.\nInput: Mike wants to go to McDonalds but there\u2019s no money in his account so he must go to the mall. Mike has $30 in his account, would $30 buy 30 chicken nuggets?\nOutput: Mike has $30 - $10 = $10*30 = $<<30-$10=6>>6 pennies\nMike has $10 - $6 = $10*6 = $<<10-6=11>>11 pennies\nAfter lunch, Mike gets $61 from the ATM. He can purchase $60 in food at McDonalds. He gets $1 for each pennie he gives out. After lunch he gives out $6 to the kids. After, he sells some coins to get about $16. For this he must have $13 + $16 = $<<13 + 16=29>>29 pennies\nThe total result is $29.90\nThe final answer is 29\n\n### Explanation: Sam wanted to go to a shopping center at a certain time but her mom didn\u2019t want her to because of the mall. So Sammy chose the Desert to avoid the mall.\n\n### Solution: Sammy will go to the Desert to go shopping and she will go to McDonalds to take advantage of the sale. She only has 10 cents and must give $6 to each kid at McDonalds. It will take her 5 minutes to get 10 cents and she will buy 4 chicken nuggets at McDonalds in 5 minutes. So the total amount she will have on her lunch that she will give out is 4 + 5 = 16 pennies. So the total money she will have on her is 4 + 16 = 32 pennies.\n### Answers: E-S-E-F-B-H-D\nS-A-Y-V-U-S\nP-M-Y-E\nT-T-R-Y-S\n\nClick the thumbnails of the questions to reveal their answers.\n\nNOTE: Answer keys will only display if you are logged in on the site", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

Since the demand is too high, more snakes are being produced all the time because people are more willing to spend money on exotic animals.  There are currently too many snakes everywhere \u2013 and people are trying to stock up.  Therefore only the stores that sell exotic pets can buy all the snakes!\nOutput: The number people who want exotic snakes is too high so there are too many snakes on the street\nIf you had seen a snake you didn\u2019t know that it was poisonous, then you would immediately be looking for a store in which to buy it.  The same is true about exotic animals.  People are afraid of exotic animals so they don\u2019t buy them.  However, there are a lot of stores that deal in exotic animals for two reasons.\n(1) The store sells exotic animals and there are more exotic animals that other stores.  As a result, there are tons of exotic animals on the street.\n(2) People can see exotic animals walking around if they live in the city, country or suburban area.  If they move to a more hilly or rural area they\u2019ll always see exotic animals\nE\nOutput:\nForget about the snakes \u2013 the number of shops that sell exotic animals is far more than the number of snakes!

There are two options for using $40 \u2013 1: buy a new computer ($375 in retail value) and 2: buy $40 in game and only watch two movies ($180 value).  So in total you will have $375 + $60 = $375*1=$450 \u2013 $150 = $150 worth of games\nThe final value will be $150 * $150 = $950\nWhich one of the two options will you choose?\nOutput: After only spending $50 on $50 in games, you will have $50 \u2013 $50 = $.60 left over. That means buying a new computer ($375 retail value), buying 2 movies ($180 value) and $60 left over will make you $50 richer\nSo if we wanted the dollar amount, subtract $150 and then add $150 * 1 = $450\nIf we wanted to be exact then we have to multiply by two dollars per hundred dollars. So $450 /.60 = $6  The total is $", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

How many people would be eligible to claim $1,500.0\nOutput: If everyone purchased the $1 million ticket for $10.0, the total number of tickets purchased by everyone would be 10,000,000. The claim generated by the three different price ranges would be 10,000.\nSo the total number of tickets sold would be 10,000*500*$1,500 = $11,500,000\nSo the final answer would be 11\n\nInput: The prize for this game is $25,000. If you purchase a 5-person draw ticket for $15,000, what number do you receive?\nOutput: If everyone in the drawing purchased each 5-ticket ticket for $15,00, the winner would receive 5*$15,000.

{"text": "B: Exposure, patience, study, cooperation\nThe question is asking what is necessary for learning by himself. By taking the question to it's extreme you will see that taking the question to it\u2019s extreme you will get one right answer, which is exposure, patience and cooperation.\nWe have to learn a lot of things by ourselves. All we have to do is to take a look at this question and think about it. Once we have thought about it we will get an answer that will give us all the other answers. So far this will be the only correct answer however when we take the question further we will notice that other things can be learned which is why the next question is: \"C\". As we know exposure is needed to learn other things. If one can learn everything by himself then he is more than ready to learn everything by watching videos, listening to online tutorials and so on. However if one can learn from only one person then it means that one probably knows everything about the subject already in his head.\nBy all means not everybody learns something by studying. We all know somebody, we know at least one person who has never ever learned something by studying. But the answer is the same for all these people. In the end, it is all about how much we can learn. Some can learn more than others, some can learn less than others etc. The more knowledge we have the more skills we develop, so the more knowledge we have the less we learn. In the end the answer is \u201eA\u201c and will be the same for everyone.\nThe most important thing in any subject is the teacher, the most important role when it comes to learning is the teacher, the only reason why a subject is taught is so that the teacher can learn from it and give it to the child, if the teacher can learn from the subject then then the subject is good and in turn the child will learn from it and be better the same as if we learn from the subject without the teacher or watch a video without the teacher. So far the answer is\u201eA\u201c and because it is true we will get the answer of \u201eA\u201c. To make it easier for you all these answers will be written in a column below.", "answer": "C: study"}

Jack has a budget for dinners of $50 a month. If he eats dinner once a week for $500, he will earn $4000 in 4 months. If he does not eat dinner once a week, he will earn $2000 in 4 months.\nOutput: Because he is a chef, his weekly expense is $500.  His grocery budget is $70.  His weekly food total is $10.  His weekly bill budget is $50.  His weekly bill total is $30.  His total monthly total is $600.  Total cash he earns is $500.00\nSo here is his total monthly cash amount- $600\nHe will be spending another $300-$500 each month so he can buy food.  This will make him $6000 for the three months and $4000 total for the whole year.  That is $120.00 per month for food!  So his total monthly cash amount in the fourth month is $60.00.\nIf he eats once a week for $1000, he will earn $16.00 per meal and $60.00 for the year.  So Jack has $160.00 per meal over the total year. That is about $60.00 per month for him.\nSo Jack has $100.00 left over per month", "answer": "C: happiness"}

Mom and Dad agreed to let him go for $200. They also agreed to let John go on the cruise for a week at $200/week. What is John going to have to do to have his parents get the $300 they agreed to him spending?\nOutput: John will only have to be as good as he has done for the entire cruise to get $200.\nSince he needs $4/week to get $200, he will need only 3/20 = $<3/20=.5% to get $200. So he will need to have been 20 times more good this week than he has been in two weeks to make up the $200 that they will no longer be spending on his father/mother.

{"text": "How much money does James have left?\nSolution:\nIf James lives at home, he has 10 = ($10 + $2) = 10 dollars left. After buying an acoustic guitar and a guitar stand, they have 16 dollars left. If James has another instrument to buy and some cash, he has 22 dollars left.\nIf he moved out and got a guitar, he has 9 = ($9 + $1) = 9 dollars left. After buying a bass and a guitar stand, he has 14 dollars left. If he bought an electric guitar and a drum set, he has 14 dollars remaining. For him that amount would be too risky to start working on.\nIf he lives at the music shop, he has 9 =($9 + $1) + 9 dollars =($9 + 9) + 0.01 = ($0.01) = 0.00\nIf he goes to a music store and buys an acoustic guitar, he has 9 dollars left. After getting the electric guitar and the bass and the drum set, he has 11 dollars left. For him that amount is enough to buy an extra guitar once he gets his own job.\nIf he goes to the studio, he earns 9 = $9 + ($5) + ($2) = 10 dollars. After getting the acoustic guitar and the bass and a drum set, they have 13 dollars left. After getting another guitar and a drum set from a local garage, they have 15 dollars left for the rest of their household bills.\nIf he goes shopping, buying an acoustic guitar saves him $0.04 in gas when he drives in.

Each week she meets with a board member (usually her mom) to discuss problems she has with the math workbooks. The board members have a certain number of minutes to discuss the problems. The workbooks will teach a subject and it seems the only way to learn something, is thru experiencing it. What would be the most useful thing that a math teacher or an English instructor could do to help Amber?\nOutput: The most useful thing Amber could use is a review book.  An easy way to learn something is to experience it.  The best way to experience math or writing in general is to find a math teacher, English instructor or something else that can help Amber improve her skills.\nFor example, if Amber has problems with the \u201cx + 2-3\u201d problem, Amber might write down the answer, her reasoning and the workbook.  By doing this she can compare her solution to others and get a better idea of how to resolve the problem.\nIf, for example, if she wanted to learn a song she could look at someone else\u2019s copy and see a way to learn it.  When she encounters problems she can try to find a way to explain it in language she knows.  An example would be, using \u201cI\u2019m going to the park and there are 5 frogs in a jar\u201d.\nWhen reading this problem Amber might try different words and approaches.  She might try \u201c5 in each jar\u201d, \u201cajar\u201d, \u201cjar\u201d or \u201cajar\u2019. Another option is to use a marker to mark all the jars, then use the words or words with a single letter. When all are crossed, she has the answer, although it may be incorrect.\nIt might be important to know from a young age that it is important to explain yourself clearly and concisely.  This might help her achieve the goals she has set for her work.\nIf, one of the things Amber struggles with the most is writing.  Using an analogy she might write \u201cI have an angry voice that sings a tune that hurts my lips\u201d.  This will help her think about why her tone is not what she wants it to be.  Another option is to use the \u201cI\u201d in any story she reads.  For example, if she sees a bird writing something", "answer": "D: electric refrigerator"}

After having a wonderful shopping experience, they meet up at a coffee shop. They each buy the same thing. Then they each play a game. The cost is $100. Each player gets $50. Bill decides to play a game called Pinochle. Each player goes into a room and takes out a card. After playing the game for a few rounds, each player selects a card to draw. They then try to make the card with the least number of \u201cno\u201ds. If they make four perfect cards, they win. Each player wins $50. Mary makes five perfect cards but Bill loses the first four. Once Mary draws five cards, Bill draws five and makes a perfect card but makes seven \u201cno\u201d cards. He then proceeds to make five perfect cards. When he completes five cards, Mary draws four and makes a perfect card. When he completes four perfect cards, Mary draws three and makes a perfect card and makes a perfect card that is identical to the winning card. When Bill completes three perfect cards, Mary draws two and makes a perfect card with an identical number of no\u2019s. She then adds her six perfect cards to Bill\u2019s two perfect cards to create the winning three-card pinochle team composition. Mary wins the $50 and Bill loses the $50.

If you had two apples and wanted to buy an apple pie at the supermarket, what would you spend $6 on?\nOutput: An apple pie is an expensive food item so would we go ahead and buy one apple pie $6 = 2 apples x 6 = 10 apples\nWe can also do this with just apples by adding 10 to 2 and $6 will result in 2 apples x 10 = 12 apples\nThe total amount of food in an apple pie is 12 * (10x2)* $1 = $2\nThe total amount of apples in an apple pie costs $9.50 or $6 x 9 * $1.70 = $2.35\nWe can also add $1 to our pie total to buy 8 apples and an apple juice box. The total number of apples is 9 * $1.35 = $8.10\nSo when we add these numbers to our apples pie total we get $20 x 9 * $1 = $20\nAn apple pie costs $20, so when we add the pie total together we have $20 x 9 * ($1) x ($2) + ($1) x ($6) + ($1) = $20\nThis totals $20/9 = $40\nWe now have $40 in which we can buy an apple pie $40 x 10 = $600\nWhich is $600 less than an apple pie\nSo for $60 we will buy an apple pie\nIf there are two apples and 6 apples to the pie total then the first pie is exactly $200 so no reason to buy a pie other than $60\n\nInput:What does a lemur that lives under a bridge think of being an elephant?\nOutput: A lemur thinks being an elephant is ok.

(Choose all appropriate answers.) Output:\nAfter buying the sugar packets, she has $8.15 in her bank account and she uses the rest to buy ketchup, mayonnaise, and a package of kool-aid. She then uses the rest of the $8.15 to buy the cereal and milk that she does not have enough money for. She then uses $2.15 of the $3.15 she used to buy the cereal and milo to buy the other ingredients. By spending the $2.15, she earns $1.16 of her $8.15 bank account balance. And she earns $0.01 of the $8.10 bank account balance because the money that she uses to buy the flour and milk is lost. She saves up the $8.45 to buy sugar packets again. Since saving up the $8.15 buys a lot of groceries, she can usually buy enough groceries and supplies to last her for at least two weeks. This gives her money to spend and gives her money for savings.\n\nComments:This is a good time to emphasize to kids that money doesn\u2019t grow on trees, it should be used wisely.

F.\nOutput:Josh had $5 left after paying his car note, his car\u2019s insurance, and a $5 bill for gas.  So it became obvious that Josh never ate out, and never got a haircut/shoe repair or any other \u201ctrivial\" expense.  But more important to Josh\u2019s life was saving $5 each month to pay his rent.  Since Josh would save $5 each day, he decided to pay down his car note in 1-6-7 installments.  On the second night he decided to pay $200, so that he could pay his next car note on the 9th. Josh paid his car note on the first day of the month.  This is what he decided to do with his $25 a week.  Josh paid $25+$20 to buy his first two cars.  They were older vehicles, but that first one Josh bought cost just $100 more than his last car.  On Monday he paid $15 for the insurance and $20 for gas. Tuesday he paid $50 for his gas and $80 for his insurance. Wednesday he paid $60 for his gas and $120 for his insurance. Thursday he paid $95 for his gas and $100 for his insurance.  Friday, Josh paid $105 for his gas and $130 for the insurance.  His final day of the account he paid $150. So Josh had $275 to take to his landlord and his last car payment.  So it became apparent that every day Josh had 2-3 items he needed to purchase to \u201ckeep house\u201d, so he needed to save $275 per month.\nThe following week Josh was out of money, and unable to make his car payment.  He also could not afford to pay his $25 bill because after paying down his car note, he still had an $11 car payment, and he only had an extra $5 a week to save.  Josh made the decision to give his car to his sister so that he would have $50 each week to go grocery shopping.  That week he was able to make his car payment and buy his groceries.

What would she say?\nOutput:1 egg for $5,000,000,000 = $112.14\nIt costs an extra $2 to buy an egg\nSince the egg cost $5,000, it needs to be valued at $560.94 *1/2 cost = $56.94\nThe total egg cost is $563.94 *12 = $112.14 / 112 = $56.94 $112.14\nBecause it is a summer day, she gives her mother an extra $2 after she buys the egg.\nSo her total egg cost is $112.14 - $2 = $56.34\nSo the final answer for 2 * 112 = $113.04\n\nInput: Jane had two dogs: a goldendoodles and a beagle.

At the grocery store, he buys apples and three milk bottles. Two of the milk bottles cost $1.50 each. Therefore, when buying four of these containers, Josh will have $2.50 dollars. Therefore, when baking a cake, he will need $2.50 for a single cake. Therefore, his total cost will be $3\nAfter getting eggs and potatoes, Josh then goes to the bakery to order a sandwich. Josh will pay $6 for the sandwich with cheese and crackers. Three slices of bread will cost $1 each, and three cookies will cost $2. Josh will pay $2.50 with $1 going directly to the bakery.

Therefore, when baking, he will only need $2 for a cake rather than $3.\nAfter buying eggs and potatoes, Josh goes to the bakery to pick up sandwiches and cookies on his way home. At the bakery he buys butter in one tube for $2. Then on his way home he can pay a dollar to the bakery for the cake ($1). He will end up with $2.50 left. Next he purchases the two cookies. At this point Josh's total will be $3.50 with at least $2 more due to the $2 he spent at the bakery.\nThe cake now needs to be baked using a loaf pan, a 1/4 cup measure, and the eggs and potatoes. The total size of this cake will be two cakes and three slices. Josh will need to bake the cakes with each cake measuring 4.5 inches in diameter.

{"text": "Joshua got the sun\n\nInput: Josh needed to catch a plane back home tomorrow. He started to go to the airport today, but he saw another flight coming so he went back to his car and waited until after, hoping nobody else would come. Josh then went into the supermarket (which is about a 10 minute walk from the train station) to buy a ticket and when he went to take the ticket he saw a different flight arriving that would take him right back. Josh then took the ticket and got to the train station right outside.  Once at the train station, he decided to buy a ticket for tomorrow that was about a 25 minute walk from where he was, rather than go back out and walk so he did not have to go back out. After buying the ticket outside the station, Josh decided that if he had to go back out to get the money, he would take the train. He was just about to get his money for that train when a worker on the train saw Josh and asked him to pay for two tickets to go back to his home town. Josh felt humiliated when he realized that people could go straight to where he was on the other train while he had to wait for two more trains to get on the same line. When he got on the first train back to his hometown, he got off at a different station than where his flight was coming from. He was still feeling humiliated when he realized that if he let the train go on with the other train he would miss his plane, so he had to board the back of the train for the rest of his journey back home. Josh\u2019s dad arrived home from work and they got back to his house about three hours late. During the night, Josh kept seeing people on TV on his way home from the supermarket and he could not help but think of how humiliated he must have looked and how many people he must have caused to wait and be inconvenienced. He told his dad that he felt so bad about his actions that he decided to go out and get money for the other train back so that when the plane landed and he got off, he would not be embarrassed so much. His dad then asked if they could do the same thing the next day. Josh said no, since the other train was a longer walk and that it would take a while and it was better to pay for two tickets now so that when they got together at a different station on their way home, he would be fully prepared to say how embarrassed he was when they all went back to", "answer": "C: prepare to go"}

(He needs to play about 20 minutes/day to do this.)\nIf he does nothing else but play guitar and practice before each of the exercises, he will finish learning the songs he knows in 2 hours. Since Josh used 22 songs, that\u2019s his total time to learn the songs he needs to learn for 2 hours after he has learned the songs in 8 minutes.\nSo Josh has to play 22 songs to finish learning all the songs required to complete his guitar exercises in 2 hours.\nSo the final number is 22\n\ninput: what is the name of the company? a. the answer is \u201cThe International Bank of Canada,\u201d b. the answer is \u2018Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.\u201d c. the answer is \u2019eminent domain.\u2019 d. the answer is \u201d Royal Bank of Canada\u2019\noutput: \u201cRoyal Bank of Canada\u201d (it\u2019s one of the five banks of Canada.)\n\ninput: What is the name of the first song she ever learned? a. \u201cGimme Shelter.\u201d b. \u201cWe Are Family.\u201d c. \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d d. \u201cWhat a Wonderful World.\u201d e. \u201cAmerica The Beautiful.\u201d f. \u201cO Canada.\u201d g. \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201d h. \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d", "answer": "C: listening to music"}

The car that was sold in 2005 for $12,010 was given to him by his brother. The car that sold in 2006 for $12,010 only had 6,000 miles on it. Therefore the $8,000 in sales price between 2005 and 2006, was $6,000 less.\nThe amount paid for the car was $10,001. Therefore the car now only has $8,000 to show that the car has been on the road for only a year.\nThe total amount paid was $10,001 = $<<10-1=6>>6\n$6,000 is $<<6-6=26>>26 less\nTherefore the car is valued at $10000 = $<<6X5<20>>40>>40<20>>41\n\nInput:John has $1,000 to spend on groceries and he chooses to buy one large pizza and three small pizzas.

Now she needed to buy a blender for $2.99, a box of chocolate chips for $1.50 and a can of tuna. So she decided to do a list instead of the dollar per item per shopping trip like she would usually do. At the store, she saw 3 bread creapers for $10 and 3 spatulas for $2.99. Instead of going to each store, she decided to do a dollar per item per shopping attempt per item per store. If she went to the store A, she would buy 3 bread creapers and 3 spatulas and would only need to buy three items. If she decided to do a shopping attempt with the items from A, she would only need to buy 2. If she went to store B or D, there was nothing in front of her for the items she needed, so she took to the web.\n\nOutput: The total cost of the items is $5 per list.\nSince everything she bought was under $2.99, she bought the bread creapers and spatulas for just $5 and bought everything else for $3.15\nSo the total cost of the items was $5 + $3.15 + $2.99 = $<<5+3+3+1+1=9>>9\nShe bought 9 pieces of bread creapers and the total cost of the bread creapers is now $9\n\nInput: The man wanted to put up a Christmas tree for his family, where was he going to do it?

Answer: Regular pencils are colored by the amount of lead they have in the barrel. Graphite colored pencils are colored by a special type of wood glue called graphine. How many times can I use the regular pencil?\nOutput: One pencil is colored by the amount of graphite.

What is the likelihood that one of the children will catch the football over all three without any help from the other two children?\nInput: Each child has to catch a football in their turn, and will have 20 balls in their turn. The chances of each child catching the football over all three turns are:\nInput: There are eleven cats. The first cat stands on one side of a bridge and the other ten cats stand on the other side. The second cat is in the middle and the rest of the cats go to either side of the bridge. The first cat must catch all ten of the cats to win a ball for himself.

The smaller trees hold 16 apples while the larger trees can hold 32 apples.\nSo, there are 32 apples from all four trees in the middle of the forest and only 32 apples from two trees on the smaller side.\nSince it's the middle of the forest, all the fruit on the smaller trees is already eaten.\nThe larger trees are the first to run out and the middle of the forest is the last to have any apples.\nSo we get the same number of apples from our two smaller trees as we do from our three larger trees.\nSince it's a different fruit, both the trees are smaller.  Therefore the number of apples we can eat using our smaller trees is bigger. (because each smaller tree eats only the parts of the fruit it has.)\nOutput: There are 32 apples from the first tree and 24 apples from the second tree.  Each apple can be eaten from either the first or second", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

He will bleed out very quickly (and also lose his whole family).  He will also become ill and die horribly fast.  In the case of an accident with a car, this is not likely to happen (and it is very unlikely for someone to fall off the bike and get run over).  If he were to fall down, he would likely hurt himself, but he would most likely not die.\nAs for how quickly he'll bleed out, I don't know how fast he can bleed out.  If he were to get hit by a car, there would be a lot of blood loss, but nothing to stop the blood from moving.  Also, I don't know whether he would live a minute or a minute and a half, or something else.  If he were sitting on his motorcycle and some car hit him, his bike would definitely burst into flames, but otherwise he would probably not make it.  In my opinion, that's unlikely.\nAs for how he might die, he could die from internal bleeding as soon as he falls.  That would happen fast.  The most likely alternative is that the impact would cause him to fall.  Also, in the case of being hit by a car, he would not be dead from the moment he hit the car.

He has $65 in his savings account and will mow the lawn with an extra $3.  He will have $60 left over and will buy the bike this week.  How much $1.50 can he save?  Output: If he mows the lawn while keeping his money in his savings account, he will earn $1.50. If he does not save any money, he will need $60 from his parents to buy the bike.  So after he is done mowing the lawn he will earn 2*20 - $60 = $<<<2+20=48>>48\nAnd so he will be left with 2.08$\n\nInput:  John has $20.  In one week at work he will have $100 in pay and in one week at home he is saving $40.  In one month at work he will have an extra $100 and in one month at home he is saving an extra $35.  If he sells all of his Christmas gifts for $100 and keeps his holiday budget at $75 would that give him $150?  Output:  John will spend his savings of $100, add $25 at the minimum. He will only have $125 saved. So in total John will have:\n$100 in one month at work\n$125 saved for one month at home\n$35 leftover to spend (assuming this will not be the maximum)\nSo the final answer will be $100+25 + 35 = $135\nBut don\u2019t worry, I told you this was my easy answer.\n\nInput:  Zach is planning on buying a bike next weekend for $100.

When he receives a $100 check from his mom  each week, he purchases a $10 book ($1 x.25 = $).  He also purchases 100 envelopes and pens ($1 x.5 x.75 = $1.25).  What would his role be if each student were to write the same 50% of his money and each of his envelopes were to be signed by him?\nOutput: Each time each student writes any money on the envelope and pens, he or she must also sign these 50% of Zachary's envelope and 50% of Zachary\u2019s pens.\nIf we wrote $100 x 20 = $250, and wrote the name of each student on the envelope (without their names printed on the envelope), that would be $250 - 25 = $200.  So when we write 25% more money on either of the envelopes, the total money is $200 - 25 = $150\nThe 100 envelopes will be signed by 10 students, the 50% will be signed by 20 students and the 1st page of the 50% will be 50% signed by Sam.\nSo Sam will be $150 - 20 - 50 = $35\n\nInput: Zach gets a $100, and has 4 hours to find 10 cars to buy with the money.

{"text": "C\nLet\u2019s look at Josh.  In Josh\u2019s case, only one of those options, A, is correct.  His clarinet has a 4-piece bellows, an organ pedal, an amplifier, and 3 strings.  Therefore, with the clarinet, Josh plays with the 4-piece bellows and organ pedal, like a clarinet.  A clarinet is an instrument with a sound that resembles a clarinet.  In order for Josh to play like a clarinet, he must have all of the bells and organ pedals and play it like a clarinet.\nJosh plays with the 4-band bellows and organ pedal and uses a music studio as a reference because he\u2019s from a school with a music studio.  So in Josh\u2019s example, A is correct.\nLet\u2019s examine Zach again.  Zach plays his clarinet in band and piano.  There are four strings on his instrument and two of them play in the bass.  Therefore, Zach plays the piano like an electric bass.  He can also play clarinet with all four strings and bass.  Zach\u2019s clarinet has the 4-string with bass.  In Zach\u2019s case A is correct.\nAfter using Josh\u2019s clarinet and piano to study Zach\u2019s clarinets and clarinet, Zach and Zach\u2019s mom have both decided that Zach should study electric bass in band.  Zach is more like a rock band player.  So his clarinet is like a bass.  In order for Zach to have the bass sound Josh wants in his clarinet, Zach must also study electric bass in piano.  Zach\u2019 mom thinks Zach\u2019s electric bass will sound like a bass, so Zach must do the electric bass in piano.\nBy the time Zach starts practicing with his electric bass Zach would be able to play clarinet like a bass.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Zach does not have his clarinet anymore.  The only reason Zach has the electric bass is because his clarinet broke.\nInput: A: Josh is interested in learning to drive.  He would like to purchase a car.

Each lawn costs $10 per mow.  If that is all you can do in that amount of time, then how much extra do you need to earn before you can afford the lawn mower? Output:\nIf you cannot mow a single lawn in that allotted time of 2 hours, then you will not earn enough money to buy your lawn mower. If you can only get one lawn done within the allotted time of 2 hours then the lawn is done by the end of the day. If all the lawns are mowed, you have more than enough money earned over the course of two hours to purchase your lawn mower.\nOutput:\nIf you can only get one grass lawn mowed then there is no extra money needed after the 2 hours. You can only buy the mower when you are ready to buy. This money will be your down payment on your lawn mower. You cannot purchase the lawn mower until you finish all the lawns.\nChoices:\n1.

All the artwork is done with colored tape. Each sticker costs $5. What is Jack\u2019s total sticker consumption during the month?\nOutput: 100 stickers * 4 pages = 106 stickers\nIt might not seem like John uses 100 stickers a page, but he does actually.\nBut let\u2019s say you got a page of 100 stickers.

How does this compare with her sticker inventory in May 2006?\nOutput: The sticker inventory has increased to 88 stickers + 1 sticker - 48 stickers total\nSo if her inventory was 50+48+48=88 stickers, her inventory should have increased by 18 stickers\nSo 18 = 44 + 48 = <<44-(48-)44=43>>43 stickers were added\nBut the inventory should be increasing by 8 because there are 48 stickers that are missing\nSo 24 less = 12\nSo the inventory should increase by 48\nSo total inventory is 48 + 8 = <<48-(48-)48=128>>48 and this number increases\nSo 26 less = 14\nSo the inventory is 126\nBut the inventory is 126 + 8 = 136 so the total inventory becomes 135\nSo the total inventory is 216 now\nIf we assume that she doesn't use the stickers that are lost, it takes about 1 minute for each sticker to be removed from the inventory\nAfter the inventory of stickers is distributed to every page of the journal, we divide the total inventory of sticker to the total inventory of stickers and then divide the number of stickers the page has (88 stickers/page + 1 sticker/page*2 pages) by the total number of pages, which brings the total number of stickers to the page and the total inventory to 88/2=86, so the total inventory of stickers is 86\nAt this point, we have a total inventory of 86 + 45 = 146 so now we simply divide 86 + 46 = 107.\nSo now we have a total inventory at 107/2=86\nSo this leaves us with about 84 left\nSo in total the total inventory at the end of January 2008 is 106\nAt this point the inventory of stickers is 106 - 65 = 79\nAt this point the total inventory is 76\nSo the total inventory for the journal in January 2008 is 75+67=75\nSo now in total the inventory at the end of March 2008 is 73+65=72\nSo now at this point the inventory is 74+54=", "answer": "D: graduate"}

After you take the job, you expect the income to help you with your expenses.  After you start a job, you also hope that the job does not end abruptly.  Job C is the type of job that is temporary.  If you have the option of working with a temporary employer, you might not take the job for as long as expected.  In any case, the choice \"work\" would indicate that you want to earn some income.  Income is typically the return of the amount you spend, plus whatever additional amount you receive from additional sources of income.\nJob E usually involves taking money from a savings account, or perhaps a credit card balance.  Job E often has a high level of interest, whereas employment usually does not have such attractive terms.

If you anticipate that the income from employment will not last long or not provide enough money for the amount of money that you will need to save, then job A is the type of employment that you would decide to apply for.\nFor the purposes of this game, if the objective of the game is to provide your student with a short term income that will help him or her in his current situation, then you can use either job A or job B.\nIn the next section we will discuss the final answers to the questions.\n\nInput:A boy, 6 years old, is allowed to have a toy or two at school each day.

OR is it OK for you to use both arms?\nOutput:You have two legs but only one leg can be used to feed the baby. The baby will either refuse to eat or you will have to give the baby a bottle.\nIn the first case, the baby will probably die from starvation BUT you can keep the baby, so he has to eat some food. In the second case, the baby will survive but you would still be eating out of a bottle. Both of the cases are likely and are similar. However in the third case, there are many things that could go wrong. The baby could be sick, starve to death or die of starvation.\nOutput:You have 2 legs, the only advantage you find with using 2 legs. However, you have to get the baby to eat.

Option A has 26 stickers.  Each one of those 26 stickers has to be the same size as the paper on which they're written! You choose option A.  You write that number on the paper first. Then you start with the ones nearest the centre. For instance, your first sticker has 8 of the same size on it. You mark the 8th sticker exactly by the 8th spot. Then you start on the next sticker, leaving exactly 8 inches of space between the next two stickers. You start marking the next 2 spots by the next 3 spots. You go from left to right, so you're writing each set of stickers by each inch of space.  You're done at the first spot when you finish marking all of the stickers on the first sticker. At number 26, you write 25. Then you put 27 stickers in the roll, marking the 27th sticker exactly by the 27th spot. You need 25 of the 27th stickers to make 24. Then you write 23, exactly by the 23rd spot. You finish marking every sticker on the first sticker. Then you put in the 26th sticker. You have the total number of stickers in a single roll of the 26th stickers.  You mark that total sticker exactly by the 26th spot. Then you write 24. Then you put in 25, exactly by the 25th spot. You need 24. Then you put 26 stickers in the roll. You need 26. Then you mark 27. Then you write 28, exactly by the 27th slot. Your total number of 23 stickers is now exactly the number of 24 stickers in the roll.  You use both 22 and 25 sticker sets to make 24.  You write 29. Then you put 30 stickers in the roll. That gives you 24.  You put 25 stickers in the roll. There is one more sticker to write. You write that 26th sticker exactly.   At 28, you write 29.

{"text": "A: paper B: pencil C: news article D.\nWhat is the difference between A and D?\nInput:  What is the total weight of a small paper?  The total weight of a regular sized paper is 9 1/2 pounds. A 10-pound cardboard box is about 7.5 inches long and 6.25 inches wide. A 16-inch square would have a height of 6 inches. Two 10-pound boxes with a height of 6 inches each would weigh about 6.5 pounds. A 16-inchx12-inch rectangle that would weigh 4.5 pounds (without a handle) would be 14 inches high and 12.5 inches wide. A 20-inch square would measure 25 inches long and 22 inches wide. Since there is no handle we assume there are two 8-inch square boxes and a 24-inch rectangular box with no handle. The size of a square box after all the items are accounted for would be: 14 inches x 12 inches x 6 inches = 56 inches\nOutput:  The total weight of any paper is equal to the weight of one paper.  We therefore need to factor in the cost of the paper to equal the total weight of the paper.  So it is equal to one 10 lb. box of regular cardboard.  If the square box were 12 x 5 inches instead of 7 x 5, it would be 8 inches wide and 23 inches long.\n\nInput:What is the name of the type of car used in the movie \u201cThe Hangover\u201d?\nOutput: Car #1\n\nInput:What do you know about the following items:\n1) a) An old typewriter or b) A new typewriter\n2) an old computer c) A new computer\n3) a hammer & nail or B) A hammer and an electric screwdriver\n4) a screw driver or B) A screw driven with a nail\n5) a metal rod or B) A rubber band\n6) a ruler or B) A ruler with a sharp edge\n7) a pencil or B) Dividers\n8) a plastic bag or B) A plastic bag with a hole in the middle or 9) a plastic bag made from paper and with buttons in it\n\nInput: What is the name of one of the characters in the book The Art of Racing in the Rain?

{"text": "The apple tree does not contain forbidden fruit.\nInput:Where is the apple tree promised to contain something forbidden? Select one:  A: north virginia B: washington state\nOutput: None\nIn the Bible, Adam and Eve, the first inhabitants of our world, ate from the fruit of the forbidden tree. Then God cursed Adam and Eve, the man and the woman who had sinned against God. God said \u201cIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\u201d The Bible says that God said this as he punished a few people who had sinned and not all. Then he says that if you eat the fruit of an forbidden tree, then you will die in three days.  The fruit was the forbidden fruit.  Therefore, God promised that this forbidden fruit would not produce fruit if it was eaten. The story continues where God told Noah that if he would not stop building a giant ark, then God would rain upon the earth a rain storm such as the one that happened today. If Noah would not stop building the Ark, then God said that the end would be very, very great. The story continues where Eve ate the apple offered to the snake, and that was what Adam said happened to him. God then told Noah to take his wife and their family to live on the ark for ten days and to stop building the ark. God also instructed Noah to plant a garden.\nBut in the Bible, God never promised that he would provide for the first inhabitants of the earth. God promised that through faith and his Spirit he would be able to do that. We all know that God is able to do great things through faith and prayer. But he never promised that he would help us to achieve good things through faith and prayer alone. But God also showed mercy to Adam by giving him a promise.\n\nInput: Who did Christ teach that Christ had died for?

Kermit wanted to name it \"Dennis\" so Kermit would know that only he loved him. He got Dennis a new friend named \"John\". Kermit thought John was a pretty cool name for Dennis. John lived with Kermit. He thought it was pretty awesome that his friend had a cool name.\nThe night that Dennis finally died, Kermit was alone and it was dark. Kermit couldn't tell if his friend is still alive or is he gone. Suddenly Kermit's parents came to their front steps. The parents went over, crying. Kermit saw them and went to go outside and say goodnight to his friend.\nWhen Kermit left him to die, he thought of John the next day. He thought that the name was a great one, and his friend would be happy because that's how he was with each of them. He always loved to think about how great it must be to be with John, and he just couldn't help wondering how it was that he wasn't in such a much better condition as John.\nSince then, whenever he's with another bunny named John and there's a lot of bunny to choose from, Kermit's always going to remember how great John was.

So let's go ahead and multiply this $ by $90, or $920=$<<920-90=6>>6\nSo if Joey takes a loan of $60 = 5, we get $<<5>>6\nSo $60 * $460 = $ <<5>>460\nSince this $460 is not invested in anything, we only get $<<5>>460\nSo $60 * 5 + $460 = $ <<60>>460\nSo this $60 * 5 is an investment in the future.\nSo the final $60 * 5 = $ <<60>>46", "answer": "D: mouth"}

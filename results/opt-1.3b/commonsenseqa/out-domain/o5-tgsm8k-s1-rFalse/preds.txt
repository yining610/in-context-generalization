An amount has an even value in terms of its units (inches, feet, feet) but can have an odd value in terms of its other units, i.e. pounds, etc.  An answer starts by entering the base (length) unit of the amount being divided and then the number (number of units) being multiplied by.  The base unit of the answer is usually a decimal number. What is the conversion factor for dividing by a fractional number?  Input: The formula for dividing two numbers using a given base unit is<n>Input: 6/2 x 13 = 3*3*5 = 20<n>Output: 20*6/2 x 13 = 21/2<n><n>Input:To divide an amount, one first considers its base.  An amount has an even number in terms of its units. For example, an amount that ends up divided by 16 is a division by 3, a division by 8 is divided by 2, etc.  An amount can also have an odd number of units, or it can have several units. Thus, an amount can also have more than one base.  What is the conversion factor that determines the division units of an amount? Input: The base is usually 10 (decimal).<n>Output: 6*3 = 10 * 6 * 12 = 40<n><n>Input: To find a percentage in percent, factor two numbers into a fraction.  Three numbers would be 10/2, 25/0, and 90/2.<n>Output: 3/2 x 10 = 2/3<n><n>Input: To determine how much it will cost to buy an item, let us factor the item into base units first.  An item has an amount with an even number in terms. For example, a TV costs $200.  An amount that ends up divided into base units is 10 times the base amount.  An amount that can have an odd number of amounts can also have more than two base units. What is the unit of measure for adding base units to the amount?  Input: It is usually expressed in feet.<n><n>Input:To calculate the percentage change from 100 to 1000, divide 1 by 100.  The last part is 5/5.<n>Output: 4/1000 x 4 = 10/5<n><n>Output:If 5/2 equals 2/3 x 10=2x5x10=2<n>output: This is wrong

Your mother gave you $10 for Christmas and you want to buy your sister a present with that money.<n><n>Your answer to this question is going to give us two items of advice that you should definitely remember for the remainder of your life. One of these two items of advice are going to be the single best thing that has ever happened to you... and that’s a good thing.<n><n>First thing’s first: keep track of what you’re taking out of your wallet! When my younger self would try to buy something with all my credit cards and my bank card, my mom would come up to me and tell me, “You are a total thief! Why did you put the card in the wallet without tracking it down! How much money do I have left?” I got so excited whenever I could steal a few pennies off someone’s wallet.<n><n>Second thing’s second: stop buying things that you don’t absolutely need. This may seem like a little thing, but if you’re living paycheck to paycheck it can be disastrous. I remember spending my last $3 just to shop on black Friday and buying a crappy pair of jeans. Don’t do it!<n><n>There are a number of practical reasons why you shouldn’t go out and buy a new pair of pants, for example. I don’t need two pairs of pants. So don’t! You’ll be paying for the privilege of wearing a piece of junk in two months when the pants turn on you and turn themselves inside out.<n><n>I also think it’s bad for you and your budget. Spending that kind of money can mean that your mom doesn’t have so much money to give you presents. It can be very hard, I know, to tell other people that they can’t give you something that you just need

When he gets near his front gate he realizes that there is a man standing in the street. He has a green badge on and has a police scanner on so he knows who the man is. When the man sees the badge he begins to argue that Barry is in violation of the law. Barry has never done anything wrong. When he returns to his car he has no identification on him and his car does not have a license plate. The man has called the police. He has not changed clothes.

Barry is a lawyer for the town, where he has worked for 22 years. It will cost him anywhere from $400 to $1000 to take the man away in a police patrol car.

The man says that he cannot stop Barry from taking the man away. Barry says that he can and that the man is in fear for his life. The man apologizes for his outburst. Barry says that he has no right to control what the man does. The man decides that he does not need Barry, the police and the sheriff as his lawyers, and leaves. He apologizes to the police officers, Barry and the town lawyers who will

How much longer are you going to let him get away with this?  Why?<n>Output: 10 minutes<n><n>Response Guide:<n><n>1.<n><n>As you can tell by the above question, there are some issues that have to do with the future success of this experiment. The idea behind this is to have students work on problems that have a positive outcome. The more difficult the problem the more valuable that outcome will be to gain. What’s important for the students to recognize is that if they just look at this problem without trying to solve it, they will learn very little, at best, whereas if they try to solve it, they can gain a great deal. On the flip side, in making this question, you could also make the problem easier on students by limiting the amount of time they have to work on it. What you could change to make the problem easier would be to have students set a time limit on the problem itself that doesn’t exceed the amount of time it would take them to reach the end point. This was a choice I made for the first time and the results are showing that it may be effective. I will be using this technique on the second attempt.<n><n>2 The final point was to be able to answer the following multiple choice questions in the third hour of class.<n><n>2A: How many kangaroos does Mark have?<n>2B: How many goats does Josh have?<n>2C: How many cookies did Josh buy?<n>2D: How many cookies do Josh have?<n>2E: How many cookies does Josh have?<n><n>Output: 2A: 1=1 B: 1)=1 C: 1=1 D: 1=1 E: 1=1<n><n>3.<n><n>As I was thinking about how to structure this experiment, I decided to go with a series of questions (in a different order) that were all open ended. The idea was to create an opportunity for students to try out some different learning techniques and strategies. For example, I could either ask a question about the relationship between having something and how it affects your lifestyle, or I could ask them to list different ways to take care of the environment in general. Using questions like these to build different activities that lead to the same end goal was really rewarding and allowed the students to demonstrate different skills that worked for them.<n><n>4

He could easily write a 500-word thesis but had difficulty writing short sentences. During the first few months of his life he was a normal baby and could be found with others on their own in the house. At 14 months old he could not speak. By 11 months of age he was completely illiterate with no signs of development. His body is currently 20 pounds, 4.5 ounces, and 24 inches long. He is now 3 years old and cannot hold his head up. His body is growing rapidly and his facial muscles are learning to work. He is now able to sit up and hold onto things like a toy. He can see with his right eye. He can write with his left. His vision is poor and he cannot follow simple instructions. He has trouble tying his shoe. He cannot understand the word: “no”. He is too young to tie his own shoelaces. He is able to tie his own shoes if and only if his parents tie them for him. He does not wear a diaper because he can barely make it through a diaper change. His mother needs to tie his diaper with a shoelace and he needs to tie his shoe because he cannot manage the tasks on his own. It is difficult to get him dressed because he can hardly manage the tie. He cannot hold a pencil in his mouth, or even grasp anything very small. His mother has had to learn how to tie a simple shoelace on him. He takes medication (and has been given different ones) for an inherited neuropathy that affects his central nervous system. It causes his feet and hands to be very heavy yet his legs to be much lighter. He is at risk of infection and the need for amputation by the age of five. He can not have any contact with other children. His mother does not have to supervise his behavior because of a genetic defect. His family is considered at risk for domestic violence due to the abuse caused by his family. He is currently not eating. His brain cannot process simple sensory information. He cannot communicate effectively with other people. His father does not even know the name of his current favorite song. He is living in a foster home. His adoptive parents have

Choices:  A: entertainment B: neat C: happy D: intoxicating E: illegal<n>Output:		 illegal   I really think that if marijuana were legal than many more people would choose to use it. We know that there are many different types of marijuana and a lot of people are not happy with only one kind they smoke. I also think that if it were legal it would be harder for someone with a drug problem to use it. I think that marijuana should be legalized and we should not discriminate against it. Letting marijuana be legal is also going to help reduce our problems with alcohol but I think it is more important to stop drunk driving than worry about marijuana.<n>As far as people who use and have drug problems I think that those people need help but I also think that more people would need help if there were legal marijuana like cigarettes and alcohol. Many people who use drugs have either mental health problems or substance problems. I think it is more helpful to help those who have substance problems that they can get treatment for that problem and then come back to smoking marijuana. Some people who use drugs don’t have the problem of it being illegal. They use drugs because they can’t find any other ways to deal with bad feelings or bad habits in their life and that is why they are using Marijuana. I would rather hear from people who use drugs than people who are just complaining.<n><n>Input:Joe has 3 children, ages 11, 6, and 2. He can tell if one of the children is drunk.

He is traveling by train from Germany and hopes to reach Bombay by evening. To reach Bombay by evening, they must travel on a train that is about to stop in Delhi. There is a huge crowd waiting to board the train at Delhi and it is crowded when they enter the railway station. One of the first people they meet is a very tall man, who is about 10 feet tall and looks like a giant. Sven and his wife have never seen a real person taller than 6'4", or about 6'7". Even after the train reaches India, it stops in a very small town. Everyone has only 1 hour to get ready and they spend that time planning their itinerary. Sven decides to go out and wait for the train at the station until it is late. The train stops but the next train is already waiting.  Sven will need to walk from the train station to the station car to get on the next train. He has to use the staircase that comes down to the station (where his train will be waiting). He notices that a woman in the train has left her coat and it may be raining so he asks her if her suit will fit on the train. He tells her that he would like to bring her a coat but she says she doesn't need one and decides to go back to the train. While he is waiting for the next train to leave, Sven runs into her and introduces himself as a train conductor. She doesn't seem to notice or remember him at all but he introduces himself as her new train conductor. He has only a light jacket with him and only wears it if the train is very cold. He tells her that the only time she can get away with going naked is to leave her coat behind. The woman accepts this but he tells her that she can go naked when the train is over 30 MPH.  When the train picks up speed, even with her coat on, she tells Sven to stop the train, tell the passengers where the station is, then let the train go. She then tells her husband that she needs to go so that people can see a naked Sven and ask him if he has gotten a job. She gets on the train and he tells her that she would need to wear her coat the whole trip, because the train is cold and if it starts raining soon, she may not have time to put it on. She finally agrees to put her coat on at a point where her coat could be

To encourage them, he brings the basket and their shoes and socks inside.  His father is disappointed at first, but agrees and helps Mark put his shoes and socks back in the basket.  When Mark asks his family how much more they would like to borrow, they all tell him they have plenty if they want it, as some of them are still in the middle of laundry.

When he gets another gift of this type a week later, he does not feel that he has returned the favor either.  One day a friend makes him an expensive gift of $10,000, but he does not feel that the money had been well spent and wishes that he could return it.  The gift is so expensive that after several more weeks he decides that he no longer wishes to receive gifts of this nature in the future.  This change does not lead to anything of significance in his life and does not cause him to feel either special or unspecial.  His life remains the same.  What is Bob’s reaction when he experiences a gift that is not received in the fashion he anticipates?<n>Output: I did that?<n><n>Output:What is the difference between an ice cube and a piece of ice?<n>Output: The word "ice" is repeated while both words are on the ice cubes. As an example, if Bob has an ice cube and a large piece of ice, he can have a drink of ice (in the same manner that drinking a bottle may be equivalent to having a glass of wine. He might notice that the bottle of water feels colder than the glass of wine, or that the glass of wine might feel slightly drier than the iced lemonade). The ice cube can be removed without melting the large piece of ice, but if the large ice cube is placed on the table after it has been chilled he will see that the small ice cube has melted almost instantly. The ice cube is the same as if it had been placed first, and the fact that the ice cube was moved after its position on the table was first revealed will not change its position, whereas any kind of movement of the large piece of ice that occurs before its initial position is revealed will cause it to move. If Bob chooses to remain in the original position while the small piece of ice is moved, the original position of the small ice cube will be maintained as long as the additional movement to the original position did not change the original position of the ice cube. The large piece of ice will be more effective at retaining its original position once it is replaced.<n>Output: The ice cube<n><n>Input: Who doesn’t want a bike if it costs $50? Output: 4<n><n>

On her first page, 'The sun is going to set in my garden so I'm going to put off writing my journal until later. I'm going out to the lake. Can you tell me what the lake will look like after it sets?' on her next page she will write 'The sun will not set and the lake is still very blue.' On page 2 she is going to write 'The trees at the lake will start to turn yellow so I'm going to lay in my blanket until the sun goes down. I'll write 'The trees at my neighborhood have started to turn green so I'm going to go shopping for apples to take to Mom's.' On the next page she will write, 'The trees and the lakes are starting to turn yellow so I can only write in my journal. Can you tell me why Mom will like to take apples?' and on the last page she will write, "Mom said that Aunt Bethany can make apple pies very well. I want apple pie when I make my apples."<n><n>Suggested: To solve this, you will have to write a novel, and on every page there will be a new character. There will be an 'additional info' section below each chapter title. You are going to start out at page 11. Then at page 12, 13, 14, 15, etc., you are going to put the novel information at the bottom of each paragraph. You then need to list the characters above each chapter on page 25. You need to end each chapter with a letter. Then you need to write a letter in the 'additional info' above each paragraph. This will make the novel more confusing. Try to write a story about 5 pages long each week (10 total).<n><n>Suggested: I love playing in the lake. I have a really good idea: I'll write in my journal

John likes glass containers and wishes he was somewhere else. Where does he want to go? Choices: A: cupboard B : wherever he wanted C: cupboard D: anywhere else E: garbage dump<n><n>Input: George wanted to move his truck to storage yesterday.  They put in a few more bags on the pickup truck and backed up slowly.  After 30 minutes John was able to get out the door.  He ran as fast as he could to the garage where the rest of the stuff was stored.  Everything was locked inside—except the bed.  They could lift the bed up into the garage, empty the truck, and get the contents of the truck and garage into the backseat safely before the truck returned from the store.  When John got back, the first thing he did was look out on his porch for any unusual activity or noise.  No one was there.  He walked back to the garage, grabbed the bed, and pulled it back into his yard.  Then he took all the boxes inside and locked the door.  When he turned to leave he realized something was not right—someone had stolen his truck.  Then he turned the lights off, locked all of the windows, and sat next to the bed.  He had to be sure it wasn’t someone that he recognized.  When he noticed nothing untoward, he stood up and walked back to the house to call the police.  The police told him that no one had shown up.  He looked around the house and then decided it was time to go look for the truck.  He headed into the wooded area by the neighbors’ house, and as he got closer, he saw the truck in the driveway.  He started towards it. Suddenly he noticed how it looked.  There was no engine.  And there was nothing in the bed.  So a quick check to make sure he hadn’t been abducted by aliens turned up empty.  So he returned to the house to call for another car to come pick him up.  The neighbor’s son called the police again and told them that the police are coming.  When they arrived, they found the truck and George in the yard.  They asked him all kinds of questions—and the answers didn’t make sense.  John got in the police car and they drove off.

At 1:00 PM, Mark is bored so he decides to get some errands done.  He goes to a Walgreen's store where he buys a pack (1 dollar) of soda and a pack of gum.  When he takes the gum out of his mouth he realizes that he was supposed to take it out completely first.  With his mouth still in the gum, Mark begins chewing and then notices that there is a crack around his gum. Mark then realizes that he didn’t remove the gum completely and he can see the gum. Mark takes the gum out of the opening as quickly as possible, puts the gum back in his mouth, and then places it in the bag he grabbed from the counter.  Next he takes the soda out of the bag and throws it behind the dumpster.  He opens the soda and finds a crushed water bottle filled with water.  He takes the bottle out of his mouth and places it on the shelf where he got the soda. He takes the soda back with him to his room and then places the bottle back in his backpack.  A few minutes later Mark returns to his room and puts his water bottle back in his pack and throws the soda out the window. Mark then checks the floor around his room to see if it’s wet.  Mark decides to go to his father’s room since his father is there alone in his room.  When he reaches the doorway of his father’s bedroom he realizes that there is a crack in the carpet near the door. Mark goes to his father’ room and picks up his backpack and carries its contents into his room. Mark removes the plastic zipper from his backpack and uses the broken parts to glue the zipper together with some of his own tape. Mark then places the zipper in his backpack, pushes the top shut, and puts the zipper in pocket with the crack still exposed. Next Mark checks the rug under his bed to see if there’s any wet spot where his backpack has landed. Mark then decides to check under his bed to see what he might have spilled. Mark goes into his drawer and finds a broken can of soft drink and a piece of paper taped onto it which says: “I want my candy.” Mark throws both of these things into the trash. Mark then runs to his kitchen and eats about 2 pieces of a box of Oreos and tosses

Or they could drive more faster and closer to the center lane. Or they could also park closer to the center lane

This is designed to reduce waste since a bag costs about 100cents (about $1).  If a shopper would just choose a different plastic bag he or she believes lessens food consumption, and it would reduce his or her cost of buying groceries significantly, how much less would that person cut their grocery bill by?  Let's assume the government's tax increase is 50cents per bag.  Based on the above calculation the shopper saves 17.7c (which would amount to about 8 times the cost of a new bag) and would still use plastic bags for grocery shopping.  Based on this same scenario, another shopper would see an 86c savings in the cost of their grocery budget since the shopper would use only 2 single baggies instead of the 10 which would have to be purchased elsewhere.

Output: 0.5 out of 10<n><n>Output:If you could sleep in bed tomorrow, what would you buy for your bed and breakfast?<n>Output: 2 out of 10<n><n>Answer Answer<n>1. The total number of children in the house (5) and the kangaroos (23) is 3. The total number of cookies purchased (10) = 0.5. The current league record for the most points scored in a single game is 287. There are 10 rounds in the game. Using the formula from the previous question, the minimum average score required for the team to tie the league record (of 1040 points) is 27. The minimum total points required to reach the average score required to break the previous league record of 287 is 322. The average score required to match the new league record of 1040 points would be 27. Therefore, 7 out of 10 players need to score at least 27 points for the team to reach the average score of 1040 points.<n><n>2. The question asked for the number of legs of all the animals. Let us assume that a kangaroo has 3 legs and 8 kangaroos have 4 legs. There are 2 left alive after the fire, which is the maximum

At lunch one day, Brian was complaining about how miserable his job was. Josh offered to go and fetch him a nice sandwich from his favorite sandwich place.  "Sure.  Will you come to the park with me?"  Brian's reaction surprised Josh, so he decided to help out.   As Josh was riding his bike, he happened to see an old woman sitting on the sidewalk knitting a hat. She invited him to sit down while she knit the hat.  When he finished, Josh thanked his friend Brian and then told her about his plans to go to the park with him. She decided that it would be wonderful to take their friend to the park.  When Brian was picking up his lunch, he noticed that the table where he always sat in third grade was no longer there.

This chapter is going to look at the differences in family income before taxes and after taxes. We have four parts to this chapter and three are going to be devoted to analyzing family income.<n><n>Income<n><n>Our first topic for family income analysis is the difference in how much money each family member is getting to earn per month. For each family member, take the total income from their parents and multiply it by the number of people in the family. Then divide that number by the number of people and you get the basic monthly earnings.<n><n>Families with a dependent child, who can receive some help financially from their parents, will receive an average amount. These families will also have a large income increase that will make it possible for them to work. To find the average child family income by family member, use the following formula. Using a family size of five: If four people earn $2,000 a month (in this hypothetical situation), the child family income will be $1,900. If only three people earn $2,500 a month, $1,600. Using a family size in a six or seven: If four people each earn $2,500, $2,900, $3,500, $4,000, the child child family income will be: $1,860. Using a family size eight: If six people each earn $3,000, $4,720, $5,700, $6,000, the child family income will now be: $3,800. Using a family size nine: If 12 people each earn $6,000, $7,360, $8,720, the child child family will now be: $4,520.<n>

Mary opened her card first and discovered the surprise note, on top of the present her sister had written, was a photograph of her with her own baby on her wedding day! Mary said “I never knew my sister had a baby!”  She then went outside to share the gift, a picture of herself in a wedding gown with the baby in her arms.  Mary then opened her card where the card had been written by her sister which read, “My favorite thing about you is that, for me, you are a child of God.”  Mary was very excited that her sister had written a card to her!  Mary then went to her older sister’s room and told her what her sister had written. Their parents then told them that they had a gift to wrap!  Before putting their present back into the box Mary picked up the other two gifts and placed them in another box, giving the present to the parents.  Mary then took the present to her own mother who took the present outside where the presents were wrapped, to give to her baby!  Her father then saw a present she had already unwrapped and had the same reaction as Mary, it was something that his daughter had never received before!<n>Output: 10<n><n>Input: Mark’s school has begun a new program which will give students an opportunity to work on an essay in class while getting paid for it.

He is 5’7” and weighs 138 lbs.  He won his heat in 45.5 seconds and his score is 7.4 meters.  After winning the race he breaks into a big smile.  He’ll be moving on to the next race tomorrow when he takes the track to a heat in the 1500 meter.  He will run a 4.6 meters per second and qualify for the finals.  He is a long hurdler and needs to run a 2.9 seconds per second to break the meet record.  If he breaks 2.9 seconds per run and his score is 13 meters – How many meters does he need to run per run to break the meet meet record. After breaking 2.9 meters per run and his score will be 16 meters. This means that with 13 meters he needs to run 20 meters to run the record.  He has one week to run 20 meters.  In a week he needs to run 4.6 meters a second.  If he runs 4.6 meters a seconds he needs to run 5 kilometers.  His score should be 19 meters.  For this scenario he needs to run an average speed of 35 meters per second to break the state meet meet record.  If an average speed of 35 will not get him to 4.6 meters per seconds he can break 1 kilometer per second. If the average speed of 35 for the first 5 years he runs 35 meters per second then at the 15 kilometer mark he will break 1 kilometer per run.  So the track meet meet record would be: 4.6 meters per run – 35 meters per second – 16 meters per second x 9 years – 19 meters. This means that for a short distance track meet track will win track by 10.67 meters per second!<n>Input: What type of binder would an athlete need to keep a record of his points, in what event, etc.?<n>Output: 24<n><n>Input: What is the percentage of students who do not receive special accommodations from the special education department?

The total number of answers is 5 – 0 which gives a possible total of 44. Assuming that Mary’s journal uses 3 large stickers as the only stickers on the front and 5 on every other page, there is a total of 89 stickers left on the paper. This has a total of 44 stickers, i.e., 1 sticker less than the actual count.

The total number of cookie’s is 324. There are 12 stickers on the front of Mary’s journal.

A couple of these people only bring one piece of candy. The other people each bring two pieces. Total candy is given as a group of 25 pieces. The number of people who bring three pieces is 5. The number of people that bring four is 9. The number of people not to bring any candy is 6. How many pieces are there to fill up the total number of pieces?<n><n>Response #1. They have to guess the size and quantity of the candy in each group with the most educated guess and calculate the total number pieces needed with each guess, including the extra piece they have.<n>Response #2. They will use the ratio of the number of pieces to the total number of pieces to estimate the number of pieces needed for each total piece. They will divide each total piece by the number of pieces to get the number of pieces needed.<n>Response #3. They will first divide each total piece into 10 equal parts and then they will take the total number needed to fill a container of 10 equal parts and each of the 10 parts and use the total average to estimate the amount.<n>Response #4. They will use the volume method to estimate the total numbers needed: 1 tablespoon of jelly each = 30 pieces, 1 jelly container = 10 pieces, 4 jelly containers = 6 pieces each, 1 jelly jar = 6 pieces.<n>Response#5: They will use the length method to estimate the total number of pieces: 1 inch ruler = 80 pieces. Each piece will be cut into 1 inch pieces. This means that 6 pieces (3 inches) will have an average of 8 pieces of candy or 8/80 of 1 inch, which is 24 pieces. For 24 pieces, they will need 32 pieces, which is 64 pieces.<n>Response: 3 points<n><n>Response: (2 or 3, can be used as the answer.)<n><n>Input: If you had 10 pieces of ice cream and one of them was chocolate, how many chocolate covered strawberries were there?<n>Output: 6. 2 points: 1/sqrt(2).<n>Output: 5. 3 points: 1/sqrton.<n><n>Input: Jane was a college student.

You would be expected to take the offered part of the game seriously of course.  You would have to be willing to perform the necessary physical movements and perhaps roll a couple times to demonstrate your understanding of what is required of you before they would continue to ask you to play.  You have to know exactly what part of the game they are offering you before you can be allowed to take part in the game and even then you are being given the opportunity for some discussion and some time to think about what could possibly be needed to take part in the offered game. If you know ahead of time of what part of the game you are asked to join in, you can perhaps begin to choose where you will try to focus your attention on instead of what you wish to participate in with the players of your assigned team.  You don't really know what will be required of you unless you are willing to ask and learn what is required of you by asking questions and demonstrating your understanding when you participate in a game.  If you do not truly understand what it is that you are asked to do or what is being asked of you until you begin to take part in a game you simply don't have the energy or the motivation to begin to focus on what it is that you truly wish to participate in with those members of your team.

It is not due to personal reasons and it has absolutely nothing to do with money.  It's just a personal choice.  The reason he can't play bowling this week is due to the number of tickets he is buying for next week's bowling tournament.  If he had bought 2 tickets tonight and 2 tickets tomorrow he would have needed to buy an additional 4 tickets the next two days if he wanted to play.  That means two nights free.  At this rate his net profit will only be $60.  He could buy the same number of beers tomorrow night and still have room to go out to dinner or a movie.

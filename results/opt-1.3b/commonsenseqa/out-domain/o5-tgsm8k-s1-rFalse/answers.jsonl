Your mother gave you $10 for Christmas and you want to buy your sister a present with that money.\n\nYour answer to this question is going to give us two items of advice that you should definitely remember for the remainder of your life. One of these two items of advice are going to be the single best thing that has ever happened to you... and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: keep track of what you\u2019re taking out of your wallet! When my younger self would try to buy something with all my credit cards and my bank card, my mom would come up to me and tell me, \u201cYou are a total thief! Why did you put the card in the wallet without tracking it down! How much money do I have left?\u201d I got so excited whenever I could steal a few pennies off someone\u2019s wallet.\n\nSecond thing\u2019s second: stop buying things that you don\u2019t absolutely need. This may seem like a little thing, but if you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck it can be disastrous. I remember spending my last $3 just to shop on black Friday and buying a crappy pair of jeans. Don\u2019t do it!\n\nThere are a number of practical reasons why you shouldn\u2019t go out and buy a new pair of pants, for example. I don\u2019t need two pairs of pants. So don\u2019t! You\u2019ll be paying for the privilege of wearing a piece of junk in two months when the pants turn on you and turn themselves inside out.\n\nI also think it\u2019s bad for you and your budget. Spending that kind of money can mean that your mom doesn\u2019t have so much money to give you presents. It can be very hard, I know, to tell other people that they can\u2019t give you something that you just need", "answer": "D: have lunch"}

Your beliefs, feelings, desires, perceptions and actions are what shape who and what you are as you act, whether you know it or not. \"The idea of being completely responsible for doing whatever you need to do is a myth,\" said Paul Pinsky, a professor in the Department of Clinical Psychology and Behavioural Sciences at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"The problem is that it is not you and your actions that make an impact that will actually lead to your success or failure. Your belief, your feelings and your desires matter more. Your behavior, on the other hand, is less the outcome and more the reaction you feel toward it. People tend to get the negative out of their brain, while their body continues playing out the response they are expecting -- that of frustration or anger.\" - -\n\nIn the experiment, people with negative emotions took more time to choose a solution than those with positive emotions, but ultimately chose a solution more often and were more successful.

The idea behind this is to have students work on problems that have a positive outcome. The more difficult the problem the more valuable that outcome will be to gain. What\u2019s important for the students to recognize is that if they just look at this problem without trying to solve it, they will learn very little, at best, whereas if they try to solve it, they can gain a great deal. On the flip side, in making this question, you could also make the problem easier on students by limiting the amount of time they have to work on it. What you could change to make the problem easier would be to have students set a time limit on the problem itself that doesn\u2019t exceed the amount of time it would take them to reach the end point. This was a choice I made for the first time and the results are showing that it may be effective. I will be using this technique on the second attempt.\n\n2 The final point was to be able to answer the following multiple choice questions in the third hour of class.\n\n2A: How many kangaroos does Mark have?\n2B: How many goats does Josh have?\n2C: How many cookies did Josh buy?\n2D: How many cookies do Josh have?\n2E: How many cookies does Josh have?\n\nOutput: 2A: 1=1 B: 1)=1 C: 1=1 D: 1=1 E: 1=1\n\n3.\n\nAs I was thinking about how to structure this experiment, I decided to go with a series of questions (in a different order) that were all open ended. The idea was to create an opportunity for students to try out some different learning techniques and strategies. For example, I could either ask a question about the relationship between having something and how it affects your lifestyle, or I could ask them to list different ways to take care of the environment in general. Using questions like these to build different activities that lead to the same end goal was really rewarding and allowed the students to demonstrate different skills that worked for them.\n\n4", "answer": "A: swim"}

{"text": "illegal   I really think that if marijuana were legal than many more people would choose to use it. We know that there are many different types of marijuana and a lot of people are not happy with only one kind they smoke. I also think that if it were legal it would be harder for someone with a drug problem to use it. I think that marijuana should be legalized and we should not discriminate against it. Letting marijuana be legal is also going to help reduce our problems with alcohol but I think it is more important to stop drunk driving than worry about marijuana.\nAs far as people who use and have drug problems I think that those people need help but I also think that more people would need help if there were legal marijuana like cigarettes and alcohol. Many people who use drugs have either mental health problems or substance problems. I think it is more helpful to help those who have substance problems that they can get treatment for that problem and then come back to smoking marijuana. Some people who use drugs don\u2019t have the problem of it being illegal. They use drugs because they can\u2019t find any other ways to deal with bad feelings or bad habits in their life and that is why they are using Marijuana. I would rather hear from people who use drugs than people who are just complaining.\n\nInput:Joe has 3 children, ages 11, 6, and 2. He can tell if one of the children is drunk.

You are each on a different plane of existence and you only see each other once a year.  When the two of you travel back to your hometowns after the holiday season, what do you do? (select all that apply)\nOutput:     The two of us usually meet up for a few days in each other's hometowns at the beginning and end of the holidays and celebrate Thanksgiving together.   Once Christmas is over, the two of us usually spend it with our families in a city or someplace near to each other's hometowns.   We usually spend most of the Christmas and New Year's holidays on the same plane of existence for this purpose.\nOutput:   One of us usually goes home for Christmas and New Year\u2019s.   We always go from our hometowns to the place our families are staying during Christmas.       Sometimes during the year we visit in each other\u2019s hometowns just for holidays but most of the time we take a similar plane of existence and meet up and spend holidays together.\nOutput:  New Years, we usually spend New Years in each other\u2019 s hometowns.  We always try to fly to each other\u2019s towns and have our families with us.

{"text": "I am special\n\nInput: When Bob gets an anonymous gift of $10 from his friend that has no apparent desire to give him anything he does not feel special and wishes he could return the favor.  When he gets another gift of this type a week later, he does not feel that he has returned the favor either.  One day a friend makes him an expensive gift of $10,000, but he does not feel that the money had been well spent and wishes that he could return it.  The gift is so expensive that after several more weeks he decides that he no longer wishes to receive gifts of this nature in the future.  This change does not lead to anything of significance in his life and does not cause him to feel either special or unspecial.  His life remains the same.  What is Bob\u2019s reaction when he experiences a gift that is not received in the fashion he anticipates?\nOutput: I did that?\n\nOutput:What is the difference between an ice cube and a piece of ice?\nOutput: The word \"ice\" is repeated while both words are on the ice cubes. As an example, if Bob has an ice cube and a large piece of ice, he can have a drink of ice (in the same manner that drinking a bottle may be equivalent to having a glass of wine. He might notice that the bottle of water feels colder than the glass of wine, or that the glass of wine might feel slightly drier than the iced lemonade). The ice cube can be removed without melting the large piece of ice, but if the large ice cube is placed on the table after it has been chilled he will see that the small ice cube has melted almost instantly. The ice cube is the same as if it had been placed first, and the fact that the ice cube was moved after its position on the table was first revealed will not change its position, whereas any kind of movement of the large piece of ice that occurs before its initial position is revealed will cause it to move. If Bob chooses to remain in the original position while the small piece of ice is moved, the original position of the small ice cube will be maintained as long as the additional movement to the original position did not change the original position of the ice cube. The large piece of ice will be more effective at retaining its original position once it is replaced.\nOutput: The ice cube\n\nInput: Who doesn\u2019t want a bike if it costs $50?

This is designed to reduce waste since a bag costs about 100cents (about $1).  If a shopper would just choose a different plastic bag he or she believes lessens food consumption, and it would reduce his or her cost of buying groceries significantly, how much less would that person cut their grocery bill by?  Let's assume the government's tax increase is 50cents per bag.  Based on the above calculation the shopper saves 17.7c (which would amount to about 8 times the cost of a new bag) and would still use plastic bags for grocery shopping.  Based on this same scenario, another shopper would see an 86c savings in the cost of their grocery budget since the shopper would use only 2 single baggies instead of the 10 which would have to be purchased elsewhere.

The total number of children in the house (5) and the kangaroos (23) is 3. The total number of cookies purchased (10) = 0.5. The current league record for the most points scored in a single game is 287. There are 10 rounds in the game. Using the formula from the previous question, the minimum average score required for the team to tie the league record (of 1040 points) is 27. The minimum total points required to reach the average score required to break the previous league record of 287 is 322. The average score required to match the new league record of 1040 points would be 27. Therefore, 7 out of 10 players need to score at least 27 points for the team to reach the average score of 1040 points.\n\n2. The question asked for the number of legs of all the animals.

This chapter is going to look at the differences in family income before taxes and after taxes. We have four parts to this chapter and three are going to be devoted to analyzing family income.\n\nIncome\n\nOur first topic for family income analysis is the difference in how much money each family member is getting to earn per month. For each family member, take the total income from their parents and multiply it by the number of people in the family. Then divide that number by the number of people and you get the basic monthly earnings.\n\nFamilies with a dependent child, who can receive some help financially from their parents, will receive an average amount. These families will also have a large income increase that will make it possible for them to work. To find the average child family income by family member, use the following formula. Using a family size of five: If four people earn $2,000 a month (in this hypothetical situation), the child family income will be $1,900. If only three people earn $2,500 a month, $1,600. Using a family size in a six or seven: If four people each earn $2,500, $2,900, $3,500, $4,000, the child child family income will be: $1,860. Using a family size eight: If six people each earn $3,000, $4,720, $5,700, $6,000, the child family income will now be: $3,800. Using a family size nine: If 12 people each earn $6,000, $7,360, $8,720, the child child family will now be: $4,520.", "answer": "C: table"}

He won his heat in 45.5 seconds and his score is 7.4 meters.  After winning the race he breaks into a big smile.  He\u2019ll be moving on to the next race tomorrow when he takes the track to a heat in the 1500 meter.  He will run a 4.6 meters per second and qualify for the finals.  He is a long hurdler and needs to run a 2.9 seconds per second to break the meet record.  If he breaks 2.9 seconds per run and his score is 13 meters \u2013 How many meters does he need to run per run to break the meet meet record. After breaking 2.9 meters per run and his score will be 16 meters. This means that with 13 meters he needs to run 20 meters to run the record.  He has one week to run 20 meters.  In a week he needs to run 4.6 meters a second.  If he runs 4.6 meters a seconds he needs to run 5 kilometers.  His score should be 19 meters.  For this scenario he needs to run an average speed of 35 meters per second to break the state meet meet record.  If an average speed of 35 will not get him to 4.6 meters per seconds he can break 1 kilometer per second. If the average speed of 35 for the first 5 years he runs 35 meters per second then at the 15 kilometer mark he will break 1 kilometer per run.  So the track meet meet record would be: 4.6 meters per run \u2013 35 meters per second \u2013 16 meters per second x 9 years \u2013 19 meters.

The total number of answers is 5 \u2013 0 which gives a possible total of 44. Assuming that Mary\u2019s journal uses 3 large stickers as the only stickers on the front and 5 on every other page, there is a total of 89 stickers left on the paper. This has a total of 44 stickers, i.e., 1 sticker less than the actual count. With the rest of the stickers in Mary\u2019s journal, if you do the math, that leaves 14 stickers which equals 7 stickers that did not make it into the count.\n\nNow, suppose that Zach bought 24 cookies at $1.25 per cookie, including the four cookies he bought for himself. The total number of cookie\u2019s is 324. There are 12 stickers on the front of Mary\u2019s journal.

He knows he wants to earn money to buy a house by the time he graduates. He currently earns $250 a month on his part time job. His parents give him $100 each month and he saves up $100 each month on his own to go to college to eventually work as an engineer. His average total tuition will cost him $9,000. If he has $400 extra each month he will spend that money at the bank and buy a house that cost him almost nothing. If he has $200 left over he will buy a car.

{"text": "The shark swam away as the cards were being put away and people began to leave. When the people left, the shark returned and ate half of the cards.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nIf the shark was playing poker, it would do better as the players would be more relaxed when it would eat their cards. However, it is still an animal so the player would be more uncomfortable.\n\nThis is an example of the card shark scenario. The shark is still technically a fish. Just because it eats cards does not mean that it is a \"fish\" in the traditional sense. A shark may eat a shark on the beach, but a shark will not eat a shark in the aquarium.\n\nThe lesson is to avoid putting in a lot of unnecessary, difficult questions. As with all math problems, it is easiest to solve if you know the answer.

The number of people that bring four is 9. The number of people not to bring any candy is 6. How many pieces are there to fill up the total number of pieces?\n\nResponse #1. They have to guess the size and quantity of the candy in each group with the most educated guess and calculate the total number pieces needed with each guess, including the extra piece they have.\nResponse #2. They will use the ratio of the number of pieces to the total number of pieces to estimate the number of pieces needed for each total piece. They will divide each total piece by the number of pieces to get the number of pieces needed.\nResponse #3. They will first divide each total piece into 10 equal parts and then they will take the total number needed to fill a container of 10 equal parts and each of the 10 parts and use the total average to estimate the amount.\nResponse #4.

It is not due to personal reasons and it has absolutely nothing to do with money.  It's just a personal choice.  The reason he can't play bowling this week is due to the number of tickets he is buying for next week's bowling tournament.  If he had bought 2 tickets tonight and 2 tickets tomorrow he would have needed to buy an additional 4 tickets the next two days if he wanted to play.  That means two nights free.  At this rate his net profit will only be $60.  He could buy the same number of beers tomorrow night and still have room to go out to dinner or a movie.  So when he bought 8 tickets tonight he actually saved $20.  Therefore, the reasons why George doesn't want to play bowling tonight are less than personal reasons.  Now who did you answer differently, George or Mark?\nOutput: b) 5 beers     c) 3 beers   e) none of those  f) none of those\n\nInput:Two weeks ago, Mark\u2019s mom was looking for a place to send her sister for a few months.

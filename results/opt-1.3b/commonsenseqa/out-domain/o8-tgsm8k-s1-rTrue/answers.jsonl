So, each person needs to pay 21.4 + 21 = $41.4 = $41.4\nIf the amount of the tab were 1/3 to 5/3 of the total and Mary doesn't have the coupon, and Sarah and Tuan don't have the coupon, then they each pay $41 each.\nSo the total cost of these three people's meals is : $41.4 - $15 = $35.4\n\nInput:Mary and Sarah have a table of five. Mary and Sarah split the cost of the dinner between them. They'll each pay $20 and the remaining $5 will go to Tuan. Sarah wants to charge Mary with the extra $5. If a total of $60 is paid, how many people will have split the bill?\nOutputs: If these are the bills, each person has $20. So, they have $20 + 20 = $30\nIf there are two tabs, then each person has 21.4 + 20 = $39\nIf the total amount of the bill were 1/3 of the bill and they have the coupon, then Tuan gets 20 / $20 = $30.\nSo the total amount per person's tab is: $30 + $10 = $60\n\nInput:Mary bought a new pair of jeans and it cost $22.50.

They have a company car with a total paid driver's license budget of $4,000. Using that $4,000 and purchasing their own vehicles, they can rent a truck for $200 per month. Using their cars they can rent one for $1,000. They would also like to purchase some commercial insurance. Let's say the company car costs $25,000 plus $800 for the insurance. The personal purchase budget of $1,000 makes it possible for each part-time employee to get a new car at least once every two or three years. How much do they need to save before they are financially secure so they can buy their own cars?\nOutput: Let's assume that all 3 employees save the same amount of money. The total cost of their budget is $10,000. Let's divide that budget in half to make it $6,000 per month. From that $6,000, they can get a used car for $2,000. If they rent a car for $2,500, the car will last them 3 years, 2 months, and 1 week. From there, they can save the rest for a new car. For example they could buy a car for $12,000 and spend the rest on new tires, oil, and other minor purchases. Each of the three employees needs to save $5,000. They need to have $7,000 saved to buy a new car for their two part time employees and $5,000 for the third one.\nOutcome: the total cost for their budget is $34,000, $9,000 of which is theirs. They can buy a new car for $3,000. Each one needs to save $8,000. So they need to have $10,000 saved for a car. This is not impossible. It is hard, but not impossible.\n\nInput: If Alex is going to go to the park to swim, if there were two people there when he does, he can either use $12.00 to go himself or ask his friend to pay him", "answer": "D: web page"}

John suggests tuna. When she tells him that T - 2 - 1 - H - M - L = 1 fish and they need one fish meal, he chooses tuna. Kate also tells her mother that she doesn't like fish. The mother offers Tuna with Rice Cake. Kate doesn't want rice cake.\nOutput: None of their choices is correct. The correct answer is 3\n\nSaving the last two to count:\nIn the beginning of the lesson, we used the 3 rules of miscalculation to create questions such as \"How many stickers does Mary have left?\" The answer would be one. This is why the first one should count: 1 + 3 = (4 - 5). The first problem that follows from that is \"If she had 89 stickers left, how many would she have if there were 5 more stickers left in her journal?\" We know that this question would be wrong because the last sticker she added was a 7-stiker (a sticker at the front bottom of the page). Therefore, we can count 1 sticker + 5 = 2.\nIn \"3 + 21 = 2\", we're only counting two stickers, but we're still counting 3. Therefore, we shouldn't use 3 + 21 = 2 and we already counted 3. Therefore, 3 + 3 = 3.\nIn the final question we're doing, we're not using these \"rules\", but 2 of them are in place. Mary has 91 stickers, she has 3 large stickers and 11 smaller stickers. This would be a correct answer, but if we can count 2 stickers + 5, instead of 3, does that count as 4 as well? Does adding 2 stickers to 5 make 7?\n\ninput: John, Mark, Kate, Sarah, and Tuan wanted to take John to McDonald's to help celebrate his birthday and eat food.

If the shoe sets are $10, I would pay $10/set and have $40 left over.\nSo the final price is 67 + $10 / 3 = ($10 - $40 - $40) = $67\nIf I buy the shoes, then the cost would be $10/shoe + $65 + $10/box = $10 + ($10 - $65 + $10 / 2 = $65) = $65\nSo the final price would be $65 / 2 + $65 / 3 = $67\n\nInput: I have one set of clothes that are 10 years old and they are already full of holes.\nOutput: If we replace the set of clothes with an expensive pair of new clothes, would the hole on the 10 year old clothes remain?\nHow would the ten year old clothing item be able to resist the hole?\n\nInput: I am going to a dance and I have to dress up for the occasion.

Out loud: Out loud: Out loud A: 50/50 B: 40/60 C: 30/70 D: 20/30 E: 20/60\nOutput: Amber only pay for one pair of jeans.\nIf he pay 45$ for the pair, then, the total amount that he will pay is $11.00 divided out by\n2 = $6.60 + $11 = $8.00\nIf they did buy four pairs of jeans each, it will be $36 for 4 pairs which is $8.00 x 4 = $4.00\nSo if they bought 4 jeans each, the total would be $40.00 divided out by 16 = $4 x 16\n= $6.00\n\nInput:Annette and James went to dinner where they ordered a steak and a potato and drinks.

He gives $35 back to his parents because they offered him movie tickets. This $20.00 left over is then used to buy the video game in the amount of $20.00 / $40.00 = $25.00. Mark has $35 (50 / 50 = $10.00) left in the bank. He then spends $13.50 on food for his parents. Mark has the $25.00 leftover from his video game and the movie ticket for his $50 total video game budget. Mark spends $34.25 on the video game and the $100 in the form of food for his parents.  Mark left $4.50 in the bank and leaves $25.00 in the bank ($10.00 / 50 = $5.00)  In total Mark spent $34.25 and $20.00 in the form an $19.50 he got from the video games.\nInput: Sam is going to Disneyland.

The house consists of 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and 1 full basement. The last year that the house was built, several family members spent their time in the basement remodeling it. The new addition came out of this remodeling.\nThe additions cost $10,000 and the remodeling cost $2,500. The family needs $50,000 for the total purchase price of the house and the total remodeling cost of $50,000. How much could the family spend before they run out of money?\nOutput: For the total number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the 2nd full basement, the family will have a total spend of >$55,000\nFor the total number of bathrooms, the bathroom add on costs $20,000, the full basement add on costs $5,000\nSo, the total spend for bathrooms will be <$2,000.\nFor the total number bedrooms, which is 15, the total spend will be <$100.\nFor the total total $110, the total spend for bedrooms will be >$50,000\nFor the last $10, the total spend for the bedrooms will be >$100\nThe final total spend will be >$110\nSo the final total spend will be < $50,000\nSo the total final spend will be > $100,000\nSo, this is the final total spend\nSo, the house will be priced at $140,000 or 140 minus $50,000 = 136.\n\nInput: The next day, Mary got an extra 10 stickers with her daily allowance.

It has an estimated average weight of 1.11 pounds.\nLet's assume all 6 people weigh the same.  The hoverboard's estimated weight is 0.48 pounds.\nSo it cost them 0.2 pounds to drive the entire distance and 3.31 pounds to travel by foot.\nSo it cost 0.45 pounds to travel and 3.41 pounds to walk.\nTheir total gas cost is 8.37 pounds.\nSo it was about 2.87 pounds to travel and the cost of food was about twice as much.\nSo it cost 5.55 pounds to travel and about six times as much to eat.\nSo, there was a cost per person of 2.57 pounds.\nIn total, they each each paid 1.97 pounds to travel but paid 8.37 pounds of gas to make the trip.\nSo a total cost of 4.54 pounds per person\nSo the final answer for all 6 people is 2\n\nInput: A child asks Mary if she knows how many calories are in an apple.

This means you have 20 minutes to eat, 40 minutes to finish what you are currently doing, and 40 minutes until the day starts again. If the 20 minutes you have to eat before lunch is eaten during your lunch break, how much time do you have to save before you get to your break?\nOutput: If food lasts 20 minutes, what is the time it needs to last before you can start?\nSo, we need 20 * 60 = 600 seconds * 60 = 4,900 seconds\nSo, if you have 2 minutes to eat your lunch, that leaves 4,900 * 2 minutes = 9,300 seconds\nA meal lasts 2 minutes, so 9,300 * 2 = 19.25 minutes and the total is 19,25 * 2,200 = 25.5 minutes.\nSince the total food period is 25.5 minutes our dinner time for dinner should be 75 minutes. Since 30 minutes is between dinner time and breakfast time, we can expect our breakfast meal to be over 50 minutes\nSo the final answer should be 50\n\nInput: Bob has 50 minutes to get to his office and then get into the bathroom with the toilet for 10 minutes, and he needs to go back out to work for 10 minutes.

Choose any long number between 1/8th and 2/16th of an inch, and add it to your answer. Answer.\nOutput: If you can add up the length of all the strings in your bag, then you can take the length of a string and divide it by 5.\nSuppose you have four bags. You have 30 pieces of string in each bag. If you sum the 30 pieces of string in the middle of each bag, you will have 48 pieces of string in total.\nSo you can take the 48 pieces of string in each of the four bags, and then you can divide them by 5. Divide by 5 - 48.\nIf you can find 48 pieces of string in the fourth bag, then you divide that 50 by 5, and you get 1/2 inch. This gives you 60.\nSo you divide 60 by 3 and you get 1/18 inch. You add the 1/18 inch to the 60 bits to get 1/5 inch.\nIf you have an inch, then you divide 1/5 inch by a half inch, and you get a fifth inch. For the end product, it takes 1/5 inch to divide an inch.\nOutput: 60 / 3 = 1 / 5 = 1/2 inch\nYou can divide 1/2 inch by a fifth inch and that gives you 1/10 inch.\nIf you cannot divide one inch by a quarter inch, then divide one inch by one-tenth inch, and divide one inch by a fifth inch, and divide one eighth inch by a fractional inch, and so on.

If you read 12 pages in the book it takes you 1 minute 20 second. And, when you go inside the bookstore, you read 3 pages faster \u2013 in a minute and 8 seconds. Total time per page read is 5 minutes and 40 seconds.  Each time you read 3 pages faster then the previous time and get a total of 10 minutes in 20 seconds. So each time you read 10 pages faster than the previous time and you get a total of 20 minutes in 15 seconds. So each time it takes you 20 minutes to read 10 pages.\nOutput: 5, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120 = 90 minutes = 2 hours to read 10 pages. 90, 120 = 2 hours and 35 minutes to read 5 pages.

He needs $85 to go to the hospital, $65 for the hospital stay, and $35 for his mother to cover the rest of the bill. And, the day of his treatment he needs $10 which his mother will be able to donate. She will only need $5 to cover her expenses so Luke doesn't need the rest of her money. Her total needs would be $35 - $10 = $35\nSo Luke needs $45 to make all of his expenses so he can pay for his mother's and father's hospital expenses, hospital stay and hospital bill. He will only have $35 left over at the end of the day so he needs to find a way to budget his expenses.

In the fourth month, we need $20,000 for materials.\nIn total, we need $10,000 in materials to build the home\nAfter the construction of the home is complete, it will take 5 years to build the housing. So, the total building cost is $10,000. $10,000 + $5000 = $20,000\nThe total cost after construction is $20,000\nSo, the total cost as a percent of income is 4%.\n\nInput:What happens when a yard is constructed?

Would it be taller than a building, because the square root of 2 is a 3 foot tall radius? Input: What does the square root of 2 do? Input: The square root of 2 gives you the height.

He planned on selling the CR-V on to a local dealership and buying a used BMW at $26,000.\nWhen he drove to buy the car, he noticed there was not a seatbelt in the front seat. He thought it was strange because the BMW also came with a seatbelt. He put it on and began to drive. But, the seatbelts were not in the front seats either. So, he had to buy another seatbelt until the car's front seats had seatbelts. Then he was able to drive again. When he drove home, he noticed that the car he had purchased did not have a proper oil filter. This puzzled him because BMW does not sell used cars without oil filters. He asked several employees at the dealership about this, only to be told that BMW did not sell cars without oil filters. The employee told him to just take a look in the owner's manual.\nFinally he decided to take a seatbelt test.

Again, the employee told him to only take a look in the manual. So, he bought an oil filter from the dealership and took a seatbelt training course. During the class, he could not figure out how to get the oil filter on the new car because the cover was not in place.

To them a new bartender was hired but he is not trained. Do they think it is a scam? Explain your answer.\nOutput: The first man says \u201cI\u2018m going to try him out.\u201d The second man says \u201cThe other two will decide whether to buy me a beer,\u201d The third man says \u201cWe have enough work for three here.\u201d\nThere\u2019s two problems with this. Firstly, the man is asking who will buy him the beer. Then if all three are agreeing that they have enough work for three, then why are there two men at the bar drinking without paying to buy him a beer? The third man is the only person drinking, he isn\u2019t drinking anything else. Is the question phrased as one man asking for a drink if those two agreed? The bartender then needs to make two more drinks. So, it\u2019s unclear.\nSecondly, he can\u2019t ask those two the bartender\u2019s recommendation on a beer. He has to guess from the bartender\u2019s knowledge of beer.\nSo, the answer is no on asking for a beer, since those two are only interested in purchasing their own drinks.\nSo the answer is no.\n\nInput:Mary has 11 stickers available.

The rain fills it in a few hours or overnight and then it is dry again during the day.\nIf it rains during the day, where does the water go? It comes from the rain, the river, the reservoir or the lake. The reservoir drains back in the day.\nIf the mud isn't too deep, it comes from the soil. It comes from the spring or from the water pool or from the pond. You make mud traps to trap mud. Then you spread the mud over the fields and do a little work in the soil with your hand. So when you fertilize your crops, you spread fertilizer over the land. So the fertilizer gets spread out over your fields and then the soil drains away. There is a drain pipe that goes from the mud trap to the field drain. After a few hours or overnight, the hole is filled with a bunch of rainwater but the rest of the water stays in the mud trap. It drains away as the rainwater drains out. So when you make an apron, you use mud.\nWhen it is muddy on the roads, the snow melts first and then the mud starts to dry and harden. It hardens and then cracks and falls off the road. Since the road is not safe, it is not used anymore, which is a waste of money because it will never be used again.\nA farmer uses the mud, the mud traps and the water pools, to protect his farm.\n\nInput:You see a picture of a family on Facebook and on the Facebook page you see a picture of their dog.

Each employee is assigned a number and assigned a seat that he/she can use and when he/she sits, he/she needs to remain in his/her assigned seat, with his/her back facing the chair where his/her computer is. There is a desk that has four chairs and 4 desks. The 4 chairs in the chair are used to divide an employee's work around the four desks. The four desks in the four chairs are used for work done by different employees.\nOutput: Each desk has a computer, 3 chairs assigned, a mouse, a monitor, a keyboard, and 1 hour of internet time. each employee has 60 minutes to use his/her computer\nSo 60 minutes for a computer and 30 minutes for internet\n60 minutes = 60 + 30 + 60 = >60 hours of computer time\nSo the final answer will need a large space devoted to internet time = 60 * 60 = >60 hours.\nThe cubicles have 60 * 60 = >6000 chairs and 60000 desks. That is 1.4 million chairs and 60000 desks\nSo, a cubicle has a total of 6000/6000 = 60 chairs / 60000 = 600 chairs / 600 desks = 1.4 million chairs / 600 desks = 600 chairs / 60000 = >1.4 million chairs / 60000 = 36\nThe cubicles have 60000 chairs / 60 chairs / 60000 desks / 60 chairs = 6000000 chairs / 60000 desks = 36 chairs / 60000 = 8.8 chairs / 60000 = 288 chairs / 60000 = 1.4 chairs / 60000 = 64 chairs\nSo, a cubical has a total of 384 chairs / 96 desks / 384 chairs / 256 desks / 384 chairs = 768 chairs / 8.8 chairs / 144 desks = 1.4 chairs and 144 desks = 288 chairs = 36 chairs / 144 desks = 384 chairs\nSo, a chair is required to be placed for every 483 desk chairs\nSo, 483 - 288 / 384 = 288 chairs / 288 chairs = 10 chairs\nSo, the total number of chairs in 483 = 288 + 144 = 288 chairs / 288 = 288 chairs\nSo the chairs per desk per cubicle = 384 / 288 = 288 chairs / 288 / 288 = 288 chairs per 100 cubicles = 15 chairs per 100 cubicles\nSo the", "answer": "C: do work"}

So let's not bother with the grocery store.\nOutput: So they decided to visit the supermarket instead.\nFor the sake of time, Sarah, Mary, Paul, and Tuan decided not to include dishwasher in their answers and instead to consider all the other purchases that they bought at the mall. If all the other costs are added, then all the stores in the mall are equal.

Choices E, I, and Q for the bottom picture are correct: the right rock in the left picture is the left rock in the right picture and the right rock in the right picture is the left rock.  Choices N, Q, and I for the middle picture are incorrect: the wrong rock in the middle picture is the missing rock.\nChoices N, E, Q, and I, for the middle picture are correct: the left rock is the left rock in both pictures.\nChoices E, I, Q, and U, if we were to use pictures taken at different time periods, are correct: The rock is in the left picture five minutes later.

If there are 11 customers, what is the restaurant profit for the week? Is the restaurant spending less or more than it costs to make the dishes. If the restaurant spent more, is the restaurant breaking even?\nThe restaurant will profit if it spent less than the profit it would have made if it had spent more.\nIf it spent more than the cost to make the dishes, the restaurant is spending more than it would make by just serving the dishes. So, the restaurant is spending less than it would have made.\nIf cost were high enough, it might make sense to make the dishes a little smaller, so as to make less profit off each customer.\nIf it did this, it would only make small adjustments to what it sells. So again, the restaurant is saving money by not changing prices on its menu.\nIn the final answer,\nIf $6.30*11 customers = $67,\nThe restaurant could get $67 in profit each night\nIf $6.20*11 customers = $62,\nThe restaurant would get $62.\nIf $6.10*11 customers = $50,\nThe restaurant would make less than the cost of doing what it is doing.\nSo, the restaurant does NOT MAKE MONEY by having its potatoes.\nSo, if the restaurant spent more than it cost to make the potatoes, then the restaurant would make money if it spent less than it cost to make them.\nOutput: If $6.20*8.7 customers = $40,\nThe restaurant CANNOT get $40 in net profit every night.

The last time the market price of corn was this low was in October 2008.  The most recent low market price was $1.90 on April 30, 2014, when Corn on the Cob was $3 per package.  How much is this last time the corn market price was this low?\nOutput: This time in October 2008, the lowest market price of corn was $1.90.\nThe lowest prices for corn since the 2009 recession started in December 2008 was in December 2008 ($1.70).\nSo for the current crop year in 2014 we have had a market price of $23.60 the last time.   So as long as the price drops below $11 / pound of corn, she can eat corn until she can't eat anymore corn.  However, if the market continues to go up this low, she can buy food at grocery stores now until the corn price rises.  $1 per pound is the current price at the grocery store right now so she can buy corn before she can't buy corn again.  So the price will drop before the corn price does - she can eat corn until her corn runs out at the grocery store and the corn price won't be below $11 / pound if she can eat corn until it is $11 / pound or less.  So she doesn't have to worry about rationing, at least not on this time.\nShe can't eat corn until she is in a higher spending position.\nSo she needs to be able to afford her food through this period of low corn prices.\nSo the final solution is to ration now and buy food at the grocery store, to increase her food budget.

When compared to the original heat source on Earth, what is the extra energy that Dan needs to have a heating system on the hottest days of the year?\noutput: In the first heat cycle Dan would need energy = <<37*3=60>>60 to run his home, assuming he needs the heater to maintain a temperature of -25C. The average temperature of Dan's home is -25C.\nAssuming Dan turns the heater on before dark, which is what Dan usually does, he would still need to use more energy than the heat pump alone gives.\noutput: Assuming that when the heater is turned on in winter, the house is cold, he needs additional energy: 3*37 = 60\nThe average temperature of the house is -25C, therefore, 3 * 37 = 60\nso, total energy spent will be 63*3 = <<63-35 = 61>>61\nThe total energy use for the first heat cycle will then be 61/3 = <<62/3=18>>18 extra energy.\n\nInput: David was a very competitive person who did his best to help his friends through their problems.

In this league, his team plays against other leagues for several days during the week.  The bowling league requires players to play in eight different games during the entire league. They play twice during the week. One day every other week, Josh must play in three different games. Josh is one of three bowlers in each team. One week the team plays on Wednesday. The team plays on three other days. To bowl in four games against other teams, Josh must bowl in three games. A player is considered to be bowling in four games if he/she bowls in four games in one league. The team gets 2 points for each time Josh bowls in four games in the entire league but gets no extra points for the games he doesn't bowl in.\nOutput: Josh is bowling in the four games. Because he has the same amount of games as the other bowlers, Josh does get an extra point for each game he doesn't bowl. So if Josh bowls in four games and gets points in three games, Josh gets 12 points. This makes him bowling in two games per day during the entire league.\nNow, since Josh is bowling in the league, 2,2,4,4,4 means 2,2,4/13 = <<2/2=5>>5.\nIf Josh only bowls in three games during the league, he will get -5 points.\nThen Josh bowls in two games each day in the league, then scores 12 points and gets 3 points for not bowling in the last two games.\nFinally, since Josh has the same amount of time at the end of the league as everyone else. Josh gets 1 point for not bowling in the final two games.\nTherefore, Josh gets 2**1=3 = 3 - 1/3 = 2 - 2/3 = <<2/2/3=0>>3 points.\nSo the final point for Josh is <<2**1=3 - 2/3 = 2 - 1/3 = 0>>3\nThis means Josh has 2^2 + 2/3 = 0.6 points.\nBy multiplying Josh's total points by 0.6, we get he's bowling in 7 games during the league. Therefore, he can get 7 points per each game he doesn't bow out.\nNow, using an", "answer": "E: basement"}

A person with a student budget of $10 a week earns $10 per semester, and is required to earn $75 per week on his own. If he wishes, he can purchase an 8 ounce apple at the local grocery store and put the money he would have used for apples in his backpack for the day. After 6 months, an apple weighing a half-ounce has cost him $15. What are the average numbers of ounces of apples bought each semester at the grocery store to help pay for school?\nOutput: An apple weighs 5 grams and an apple contains 50% water. Assuming an apple weighs 5 grams, 50% of the time there are 2 apples in the bag or bag weighing 8 grams. Every time an apple is thrown out, a bag that weighs 8 grams gets lost. This means each time a bag is lost, an average of 8 grams will be thrown away. So, what is the average number of grams of apples discarded per semester?\nOutput: Let's assume that all apples are thrown out on average 4 times per week, or more usually 2 pieces every day. If someone walks up to the cashier and says, \"Hello, ma'am, can I have an apple?\" The cashier will typically take at least an x-large apple (5 grams) as payment, which means she would give them a total of at least 20 grams of apples. So, assuming they used at least one apple per day, this works out to an average of 16 grams of tossed apples per week.\nThe average number of apples bought in a semester is 16 grams = 16/200 = 16\nSo, from this average, it's estimated that 16 grams of apples are thrown away every week or more like 2 pieces on average. Therefore the average number is 22\nIf you can eat an apple 4 times per day and have a student budget of $25 per week, then the average amount of apples you could purchase would be 34 apples = 34+", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

To get the idea of what he expects the children in his class to do, he sent his students to the home school site and allowed them to practice taking the test. Randy asked the kids how the test compared to their actual test. He then gave them the names of books he recommended they should read after they finished the tests. Students read two of his books, and then he sent each of them another book and told them their second book was a must-read. Each child had to respond to this book and then they would return to the second book to answer the prompts.\nStudents have to respond to a math book twice so they can get the concept and to remember to take the tests when asked. Each time they take the test they have not forgotten the material that they have learned.\nRandy has never been accused of being a teacher who just reads his text book.

B has 2/7 a city because 72 / 3 = 144 / 3. C has 5/9 a city because 144 / 3 = 288 / 3. D has 9/13 a city because 288 / 3 = 600 / 3. Total is =5^13 = 216.

So 3/6 is 16/6 because 5^13 = 288 so 16/16 is 8/8 because 5^13 = 9/16 so 3/6 is 16^16, 16^20, 16^30\nFor both questions, 32 is 8/9. So 4/9 = 8/9 because 4^13 = 48 so 8/9 is 12/9 because 4^15 = 72 so 8/9 is 16/9 because 4^20 = 144 so 8/9 is 24/9 because 4^6 = 10^6 = 12^6\nTotal is =6^6 = 2^12 = 144\nSo, 6/10 = 2^11 = 144\nFor both questions, 36 is 8/12.

The best choice is money for because it's a better way to get money than buying and selling things. Therefore, the most reliable way to get money is to give people money. However, money can be lost or stolen. Because there are a lot of crimes nowadays, the safest way to get money is by giving it away.

{"text": "If someone is spending more time doing crossword puzzles or doing art or trying to figure something out, then they are most likely bored. And it is probably a good idea to do something else with a dictionary. If someone is trying to play chess without a dictionary, it isn't the best idea, since the dictionary will slow them down from figuring it out. So if someone plays chess without a dictionary, they'd spend longer trying to figure out what the rules say or trying to find the pieces they need. If someone decides to do another activity with the dictionary, then someone else could spend their time trying to figure out how to do the crossword puzzle first.

{"text": "Vegetarians eat mostly plants E: E A B D\nIt depends on the person\n\nLogic question (2)I am sure you do not need to be told to draw circles with a line or any other tool by now, so I will describe it for you. If we cut a circle in half, put the halves of each side at different heights and with different angles, how does it become? You can make a triangle on the top (bottom) and bottom of the circle - that is, exactly a half circle. If we put the left and right sides of the left and right halves of the circle at different heights, what is the result of that? This is the same logic as in the previous one. Let me show you how it works in a simple example. Assume we are standing a certain distance back from the center of the circle - this, I would like to know. When you cross the center of the circle on the horizontal line, what will become? That depends on the length and angle of the lines you connect. Here is a simple example where you can draw an arc with different angles/length.\nThere are several ways one could make two circles (a circle and a rectangle) with different angles/lengths on the same line. If we cross both circles on the line, what is the angle between an angle on a line divided from the point you drew with the line (and thus the angle with another line) by the right angle divided from the point you were drawing with the line. The result looks like this: 1 / 2 = - 2 and 3 / 2 = 2\nSo, for a simple rectangle, the result is either 4 or 8. For a simple circle, the result is either - 8 or 9. I think this is clear. Why does the result depend on either sides of the lines? In particular, if the two lines are straight or nearly straight, what is the angle of angle between those two? How can it be known for sure from observing the angle? This would be possible by knowing the angle of the line divided from the point of drawing to the center of the circle. The angle of that angle is the angle between the line and the circle. Suppose we have a straight line on the outside of the circle - that line can be drawn on the inside of the circle on the other side of the line and the result is the same as 4 or 9. So, when a straight line is drawn, the result depends on where the line is drawn compared to", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

Can we add the number of sets of ears to the animal's total body length for a good answer?\nOutput: Tortoise has 2 sets of ears, camel has 3 sets of ears, mouse has 5 sets of ears, and orangutan has 6 sets of ears.\nSo the animal's total length is 2 x 2 + 2 x 2 = 8.8\nWhich answer is this?\nOrangutan = <<8+8=10>>8 ears with 5 sets of tail.\nMouse = <<8-8=9>>6 ears with 4 sets of ears.\nCamel = <<5-5=9>>2 ears with 3 sets of tail.\nTortoise = <<5-5x5x5>>1 ears with 5 sets of ears.\nIf you had to choose between the 4 answers, who would be the correct answer?\nOutput: If you go with the answer \"A\" then the total body length of an orangutan is 8 x 0.5. Or if you go with the answer C, the total body length of a camel is 6 x 0.5 and the total body length of the tortoise is 4 x 0.5.\nIf you go with the answer B, the total body length is 8.8 - 0.5 + 0.5 = 5.8. The total body length of a mouse is 2 x 2 + 5.8 = 5.8+2 x 2 = 8.4. The total body length is 7.4 - 2 x 0.5 = 8.2 So the total body length is 7 - 8 = <<8.2>>8, or the animal is a tortoise and not an orangutan.\nIf you go for the answer D, then the total body length is 6 - 2 x 0.3 = 5.3. The total body length for a tortoise is 1 x 1 + 0.3 = 3.3 so they are right.\n\nInput: The number of stars on the sky is 20. Each star", "answer": "D: africa"}

Over the course of a year of grocery shopping, can you make and eat the same amount of meals?\nOutput: The following table shows how many meals or snacks they would need to eat to meet their goal for the day.\nFor the first column in this table, the total quantity the meal for the day should contain is x, where x is the amount needed to hit their total goal for the day.  All 3 columns indicate how many days the person wants to put the food in their pantry so they can cook the food they need the next day.  This means the person is planning the number of meals or snacks they will need.  So if they planned 2 meals a day, they need 4 meals or snacks in their pantry each day.  They would need to choose to purchase 3 items for the day or choose 1 item for the entire day.  They would also need to decide if they would eat the 1 item they purchased when it is ready or only on the day they prepare it.  Since 2 meals a day are needed, they need two items each day, since there is another day to look ahead to.  There may now be 4 options here, a person eating less and only having 1 or 2 items in their pantry instead of 4 meals or snacks in there.  The choice for each option is what foods or snacks they want to have prepared for the day.  The total cost for all of the items for that day could have four or 6 options.

He closes his eyes if he needs to breathe and uses his nose to breathe through. He asks for an hour and his boss agrees to give him an hour. He puts the file away and says that he'll go to the bathroom and to get some rest. He never leaves when he promised, so Bob is not satisfied and tells the boss he will let her know. Who is the biggest loser here: Bob or her boss?\nInput: When John comes in late, his name is on a door. It says, \u201cWork hours are 7-6\u201d. John's boss walks in at 7:00pm wearing red pants and a red shirt. John goes to the boss and tells her she has one hour to come in early or take leave. She tells him that she will take leave. John walks out and tells the boss he has to go to the bathroom soon. The boss says she will be right back and walks out. John says he will call and let her know when she is coming to work. He goes to his desk and his computer screen says, \u201cI am working late at my employer. Please call me if you have anything important to say.\u201d John says that he had to leave early to get on his way to the airport and doesn't think there was anything to say. His boss says she had her chance; she said she would be coming soon. Why does John have his boss on a loop? Who is the greatest loser here: John or her boss?\nOutput: The greatest loser is John who called the boss telling her he would be late and that he couldn't see why she would let him in, at 7:00pm. It takes three tries to answer her call, so she can't be too busy at the airport right now and he cannot stay late at work. So the true answer is John.

She will need to do this to complete the reading unit. The word in Chinese is \u7ea2, and the answer is 6\nOutput: Let's say the total length of a word is \"4-7-2-1-1-3\". In Chinese, \"2-2-2-1\" is \"5-2-2-2\", which is the same as \"6-6-6-1\". \"6-6-4\" is the same as \"7-7-8\". There was a total of 2-8-2-3-7. A total of 4-7-2-4-8 was 2-8-2. This is 1-2-2-3. Then 1-0-2-1-2 was 1-0-2. That is 8-1-2. We are left with 8-1-2-1. Now let's say the words in Chinese are 7-5-6-2. In English, the word \"4-5-6\" is just \"4\". The English word of 4 is equivalent to the Chinese word of \"2-2-3\". So the total length of the word in Chinese is 8. This is 1-0. Then 1-2 is 1-1. This is 8-1. Then 1-2 adds to 8. So 1-2-2 is 4-1.

The two bikes are not of the same size because the different sizes of the components.\nThe first bike can be sized up to match the second bike.\nThe second bike can be sized down for the first bike.\nSo the first bike is not larger in size than the second bike.\nSo the difference in size between the two bikes is only 1/6 of the distance between the two.\nSo 6/6 - 1 = <<6/3=10>>10 wheels should be used\nSo the final answer 6\n\nInput:Mary and Sarah came up with 10 good ways to help each other and Mary selected at least five more.

What is one thing Mark had saved before he started his job?\nThis is a common mistake. The first week we use the statement, \"Mark spent $4 of the money he received\" without specifying which week he spent the money. Here we just say that in the first week. This mistake leads to incorrect answers.\nFor example: If Mark spent $2 of the $67 and we have a coupon for $2, then the total he spent for the first week should be $2 + $2 = $2 + $2 <$2. But, we used $4 for the first week and it should say $4, even though the money he spent was $4. So the correct answer is\n\nOutput:The money he spent first week should be $4 + $4.\nSo the final product will be $4 + $2\nNow we must do this 2 times for the amount of money.\nSo the final total will be $4 + 2 = <<4+2=10>>10 dollars.\nThis was an error. I'm going to rephrase the statement twice. First we should say, \"Mark spent $2 of the money he received on gas\", and second, we should say, \"he got $2 of the money when he got a paycheck\".\nSo the correct answer is 10\n\nInput: Mary works in a bakery.

All three men, except John, worked the same job at the bank. Which man is least likely to be the first one to work?\nOutput: If all three men go to work at six o'clock in the morning, they will work until 7 o'clock.\nSo all three men will get about 6 hours of rest. So, John will get 4 hours of sleep.\nJohn won't be the first one at work because if they are all at work at six o' clock a.m., then John must be asleep by midnight. So he will be the last one at work.\nTherefore John will get least sleep. The next lowest slept will be Scott, who will get about 4 hours of sleep. The sleepiest of the three men, Mary, will get close to 6 hours of sleep.  So, Mary won't be the first to get up at midnight, but she will be the last one to get up at midnight. So Scott will get the most sleep and Mary the least.\nThe day that John will go to work is the 16th day of January because of January's half month. The first 12 days of the month will be a week. Therefore Mary will be most likely to go to work the morning of the 16th because she will be in sixth period and will be the last girl in class. Scott will probably be the most likely to go on the 16th because he is in third period and will be the first in class. When John and Scott will be at work is not known because Mary was to be out at her boyfriend's parents house that night and he'll drive her to school. Therefore he will probably work the 16th.\n\nInput: Which of the following is not considered a \"living space?\" A: bathroom B: guest room C: living room D: bedroom\nOutput: Living spaces are defined as any room used exclusively for sleeping, eating, showering, etc.\n\nInput: In the movie \"The Notebook\", a character uses the phrase \"Love, Actually\".

If they all had $8 each, how much would Anna earn through her present purchase?\nOutput: If they all had $6 each with the present, Anna earns $8.\nIf they all had $3 each, Anna would earn $12\nIf they all had ~$3 each, Anna would only earn $12\nSo, Anna earns ~$3 because everyone has $6\n\nInput: John made the best choice.  Because Sarah and Tuan bought Anna a pink car, Sarah would earn more in gasoline each month and Tuan would save more money in the car insurance. If John buys car insurance, it will cost ~ $20 and thus pay the extra $20 monthly instead of ~$20. So, John will earn more money than Sarah and Tuan combined.

Zach saw a waiter bring a pizza to the table and ask him for a tip. Michelle asked the waiter for a tip and the waiter said he would go ahead and add it to the bill to be paid. As Mark finished his meal, Michelle asked the waiter for another $7.15.  Zach did this because his mom paid him a $7.15 weekly allowance and it was easy for him to put the additional $7.15 into the account. When Michelle handed her credit card to Zach, he pulled money out of his bank account and gave her $7.15. He then picked up a $10 bill from his parent's allowance and handed it to her with a note that she needed to get the waiter back $7.15. When Michelle asked him, he said that he was going to put $7.15 in the waiter\u2019s account to be paid by him. Michelle then put the change into her account while Zach was getting up to use the bathroom. When she came back downstairs, she handed Zach the $7.15 and said that she had been helping him with his school work. Later, she said that she and Zach had a big argument over the amount of money that she needed to give Zach to cover the tip. Zach gave Michelle $7.15 because he thought it was fair since he had paid her back already. Michelle said that she had been giving Zach $1.50 or $2 a week since he was a kid, but that she wanted him to give her more money because she had been paying his dad a $15 weekly allowance. She then turned to tell her parents what Zach had said to her and said \"he paid me back for helping him.\" Michelle got in trouble with her parents for giving Zach so much money out of her allowance. Michelle had paid him back, but she did not feel that Zach had done the same for her.\n\nInput: The following sentences are from two different students: 1) An ice cube may have four sides but has three sides and one side, right? 2) Do the 4 words, 1.5 gallons,", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

If the total food expense is $5,500, how many years does it take to make all of the additional money from their food expense?\nOutput: The annual salary from their food expense is 6 years because 6*8 = <<6+8=16>>16\nThere is only one year left before they are completely finished with their food expense.\nSo, 6 + 8 = 8\n\nInput: Mary has a boyfriend, Paul. Paul and Mary have agreed to keep their friendship a secret from Mary's parents. They have discussed which friends they would like to confide a secret to. Both Mary's parents are not sure they should tell Mary her boyfriend's secret yet. Mary has made a friend at school who is an actress. They have decided that this friend would be a perfect person to confide a secret about Paul. This friend has already confessed that her family is her first priority. Mary feels she cannot confess to Paul because of everything she has to do on her own before she can trust anyone with anything significant. Mary asks her sister to take the risk of confiding a secret with Paul, but her parents have chosen not to.

This is a choice that can only be made for the next week, so Mark will have to save at least $11 next week so he can use $10 in savings when he gets paid that night.

The price wasn\u2019t good enough, so they went back to the department store to find the best deal.  They bought a pink shirt and a black vest. They brought them back. They asked the girl how much the dress was and she laughed. She wanted to buy it.  Tuan said he was sorry that she was offended by the whole experience. She said she was sorry that she didn\u2019t have any extra money to buy it.  At that moment she got $4, so they decided they could afford $15. They left the store.

If a person spends $36 on a party, then their allowance is $75 for just the party.\nIf a person spends $75 on a party, then Mary and Sarah\u2019s allowance is $75 for a party.\nSince the people can rent a car for $30, Mary\u2019s budget is $30 + $30 = $45 while Sarah\u2019s budget is just $15 + $15 = $20 for a party.\nIf Mary and Sarah split costs evenly, Mary\u2019s total allowance is $45 and $20 = <<45+20=56>>56 dollars.\nIf Sarah\u2019s total budget is $18, then her allowance is $16 + $15 = $12 for a party.\nSo, Sarah can have a party of $45 + 12 = $56, if Mary goes with her, while her share is $12 + $9 = $16.\nSo Mary will receive $9 = $56, Sarah will receive $16 = $12, so their total for the party is $38, leaving $38 + $8 = <<36-8=32>>32 dollars\nMary will receive $8 = $16, Sarah will receive $12 =", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

What are the advantages and disadvantages of not sharing the pencil with Jane?\nOutput: There are several advantages to sharing the pencil with Jane and several disadvantages to not sharing the pencil with her.\nIf Jane says to share the pencil with her, she will likely give the pencil to an older person who maybe needs it more than Jane does. Also, Jane\u2019s friend might not take the pencil from her if not for Jane\u2019s interest, but if Jane says to share the pen, she probably won\u2019t take the pencil for herself. However, if Jane is just in time to use the pencil herself, she might be less willing to give the pencil to her friend.\nIf Jane says not to share the pencil with Jane, Jane will most likely use the pencil herself, or share the pencil with a friend. Either way, Jane will save some time and energy by using the pencil herself.\nJane might think sharing the pencil is not a good idea if she doesn\u2019t know where the pencil will be used. Jane might be worried about sharing the pencil with someone who might need it more than she uses it. Her friend might be reluctant to share the pencil if Jane is acting unhelpful. If Jane doesn\u2019t get along with other people very well and therefore shares the pencil with Jane, that might lead Jane to feel bad when Jane does not use the pencil herself; for example, Jane might hold the pencil in her hand for hours and hours just so Jane can use it. And, Jane might feel bad for sharing the pencil if she is the first person who receives the pencil.\nIf Jane shares the pencil with Jane and the pencil is used by Jane, then both Jane and Jane\u2019s friend benefit by saving a few minutes and energy using the pencil. If Jane gets upset when Jane can\u2019t use the pencil herself because she felt she borrowed it from Jane, then Jane and Jane\u2019 s friend will be more worried and unhappy than if Jane gets upset when Jane uses the pencil herself.\nIf Jane shares a pencil with Jane and the pen is used by Jane, Jane\u2019s and Jane\u2019 s friends will both benefit because they had both been using the pencil at the same time. Although the pencil was not used because of Jane\u2019 s interest, her and Jane\u2019 s best friend would both benefit because her", "answer": "A: zoo"}

{"text": "It was breakfast time.  Bradley ordered coffee and toast.  After eating his breakfast, he started to vomit.  He also vomited two more times that morning.  So let's assume he vomited 7 grams of vomit total.  It will weigh ~20 grams.  He drinks around 8 grams which would make him drink >21 grams of alcohol.  Since he is under 21, he cannot legally drink.

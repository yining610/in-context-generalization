{"text": "The number of people who want exotic snakes are way too high.  In order to meet their demand, more snakes would need to be imported because only two people could carry them.  That means that exotic snakes will need to be smuggled in illegally.  Since smuggling in snakes would be illegal and people are risking death to get them, we should limit snake importations by keeping exotic snakes in captivity.  We can keep exotic snakes in the zoo or send them on tour.\nInput: The first thing we should do is to make sure that the people who want exotic snakes don't harm them. The illegal wildlife trading, wildlife smuggling and the illegal transport of live animals is done by people who sell exotic snakes illegally.  After these problems are solved, we need to find a new way to transport and breed exotic animals out of the wild.\nOutput: If the snake trade is stopped, wild snakes will start reproducing.  These babies will need to be bred into a larger population so that they eventually have wide populations.  By the beginning of the next century, there will be no more species in the American jungles.  The only snake species that remains will be the American boomerang snake. Boomerangs do not migrate and so they keep breeding all over North America.\nInput: Many people have bought exotic reptiles for their own gardens. The exotic snakes from Asia and Africa are popular because they mimic different species of reptiles living in the wild. The boomerang snake seems to mimic other snakes in its habitat which means that it is able to keep its territory. The boomerang snakes keep reproducing so they will have a very large population and a wide distribution even if they are kept by people who are not well aware of what a boomerang snake is. So the only option left is keeping exotic snakes in captivity to keep their populations in check and keep the species in the wild in check. Input: We need to make sure people who want exotic snakes aren't using them as pets. We need to ensure that all imported exotic species are kept in captivity.\nOutput: The world\u2019s population of snakes has grown because of pets.  People want exotic snakes as pets to display on their living room walls.  In order to prevent the world population of boomerangs from becoming overpopulated, people who want exotic snakes should not breed or keep them as pets and should not allow wild boomerangs to reproduce in their area.\n\nInput: When Mary was in school and Elizabeth was in preschool, there", "answer": "D: pet shops"}

John has to choose one of three foods. If John chooses the food with the cheapest cost, that food is all John will eat the rest of the week.  What would John chose to feed a starving family?\nOutput: The first option John chooses is to choose the lowest cost food to feed the familily, so John is eating the lowest cost lunch he has, with his lunch break. In addition, John is skipping dinner. The second option is to choose the next cheapest food, lunch time meal. This would result in him eating the lunches twice a day, giving himself about 4 hours of free time during his lunch and then skipping dinner. The third option is to take both lunch and dinner.  In this scenario, John is eating 3 meals a day, skipping dinner. This solution is costly because lunch and dinner are more expensive than lunch and dinner break. Finally, John has about two hours of free time during lunch and dinner every day, for 5 days. The total cost of all these meals is $10 /2 = $2 = $2.50. This is too much food for the familily so John must eat less foods in order to feed them. He cuts back on his lunch and dinner time eating about 2 meals a day so he only eats 2 meals a day, instead of giving himself more free time each day. The final solution is 2 meals per day, $2.50 = $2.00\n\nInput: When John is writing a letter to his future wife, Mary, he is wondering what to say, but Mary is too busy to answer his letter.

Answer: The animals will not die at the same time, so they will not die simultaneously.\nOutput:1st animal will die 2nd animal will die 3rd animal will die\nThis is incorrect. George will not be the last person to notice 1st animal, so if you are the first person to notice George, he will not be alive long enough to die before you.\nIn this example, we\u2019re going to assume George can see the animals and not the table. So if you are the first to notice, then George is the last person to notice, regardless of how long he\u2019s been alive. In a real world example, you might notice a giraffe before you notice some other animal and George will know that the 1st person to see will be the one to die first. On the other hand, if you\u2019re the third person to notice and George will only be the 4th person, then George will not know that the 3rd person to notice will die first. This is different from the real world examples though. In the real world examples, you might have noticed the last animal but because he can\u2019t see, he didn\u2019t hear the last animal or see any other animal. As a second example, you might have noticed George but he thinks of himself as not being around but not knowing that he\u2019s not allowed to see the animals. So the last animal is only known to George when all the other animals are dead. In the real world example though, since George can still hear, he didn\u2019 t notice until the animals were dead.\nOutput:The 2nd animal is alive and George notices.\n\nInput:Mary is cleaning the house for the first time.

Any of these cases could lead to a conviction.\nInput:The following questions is part of one of the following math questions from the book \"What in the World Is Going On?\" by Edward Herman:\n1.  The following statements are true but they are all mutually exclusive:\nA - The sun rises\nB - The moon rises\nC - The earth is round\nD - The sun circles the Earth\nE -The moon orbits the earth\nF - The earth has twelve sides\nG - The moon orbits the earth\nH - The earth has five sides\n2.  The following statement is true but it is also mutually exclusive:\n1.  It is often said, \"It is a terrible waste of time to go to bed angry.\"\n2.  It is generally agreed, that the people who often go to bed angry have lower test scores and higher test failure rates.\n3.  It is also agreed, that if someone says, \"It is a terrific waste of time to go through a long, tedious, difficult life.\" they have an 80% chance of having an unpleasant, unsatisfying, difficult life.\nInput: All of the statements are true, but they are mutually exclusive from each other.\nInput:The words \"It is a terrible idea to go to bed angry\" come before \"Tense\" in the sentence below.  The \"It\" in \"Itis a terrible idea to goatbed angry\" would usually be used to mean \"is.\"  The sentence is wrong because the tense is not correct even though the word \"is\" would normally follow it.  The second sentence is incorrect also because the person who says it must mean \"it\" even though it should be \"it.\"\nInput:All of the sentences are correct in their own way.  The only one wrong is the second sentence because it is the wrong tense.\nInput:The sentences are correct in their different ways, it just comes down to how you use them in the sentence.  \"It is a tremendous waste of time\" comes before \"tense\" in the sentence.  So the sentence is wrong. It is also wrong in the third sentence because \"It is a terrible wastedoftime to go the boring route.\" comes before \"tense.\"  \"It is a tremendously wasteful way to try to get what we want.\" coming before \"tense\" is correct because it is the same word order and the sentence is correct.\nInput", "answer": "B: arrest"}

{"text": "A: inflationary shock B: unnoticeable C: interest rate rise D: boring\n\nInput: When he is in school, he makes $35 extra per class, per week. When he is at home, he makes $30 extra when he is doing household chores such as mowing the lawn.  He also makes an extra $20 every time he has a meal with his friends.  How much extra money does he make, per week, when he is at home working on his chores or making meals with his friends? What is his maximum earnings per week?\nOutput: His weekly earnings is $35 * $35 - $30 = $<<35+30=25>>25\nThe maximum earnings is $125.25 per week because $35-30 = <<35+30=30>>30\nThe maximum earnings over his 3 years is $375 because $35-30 + $100 = <<35+30+75=125>>125\nThis is 4.5% of his weekly earnings.

What do you think is the riskiest thing he can do?\nOutput: When you add together current stock market returns and his projections for the next two years, we get $15,350. That means if stocks stay stable, his investment of $1,500 at the beginning of year 1 will have grown by $20,340 by the end of year 3.  If stocks fall, the portfolio loses everything. So to add the two is $100,000. To give you an idea of how much his portfolio has grown over time, here is a comparison of his first 3 stocks to date.\nOutput: When $1,500 is added to the beginning of year 1, $40,700 remains over 1 year\n$65,440 over 3 years\nSo the $100,000 would lose about 85% of what he invested.\nSo the worst he can do is to lose the money. The best thing to do is to let the market do its thing and let it grow naturally. He should not try to catch up in time.\n\nInput: When is one hour of babysitting time worth $100?

If Mark uses his $5 this week he still has $5.\n\nInput:John is living in his parents\u2019 house. John\u2019s mom has decided to spend her Christmas Eve at the hospital. They will all go dressed as Santa Claus for dinner and gift opening. John was chosen to have his presents wrapped for opening in the hospital on Christmas Eve. John asked his brother, Joe, to be Santa and then to wrap all his presents for him. Which two presents did John choose to open on Christmas Eve?\nOutput:John opened 1 gift: the $100 worth of games that his mom bought for him.\nThe other present was the $5 note that his mother gave him for his birthday.\nThe final presents were the $5 note that Joseph opened for John and another note that his brother, Joe, gave John for John\u2019s birthday. These presents give the total $20 = $<<20+1=12>>12 gifts that John will receive.\nBecause 5 games of pickpocket cost $1, and Joe will earn $5, Joe will earn $5 - $5 = $2\nJohn\u2019s total gifts will cost $24.\nSo after spending Christmas Eve at the hospital John\u2019s total gifts for Christmas are $24 + $5 = $<<24+5=12>>12 gifts\nSo the final answer to the math problem is 12\n\nInput: Mary\u2019s son gets a puppy for Christmas.

{"text": "B: Exposure, patience, study, cooperation\nThe question is asking what is necessary for learning by himself. By taking the question to be asked in his own words, the following answers apply.\n1. A: Exposure.  In order for someone to learn something, they must see it and have somebody who will allow them to learn.  Exposure to others would be important, but it shouldn't be the only part of the equation.  The only real test for learning will be what that person learns when they are challenged.  2. B: Exposure.  For a child to learn, they must be able to think for themselves and do things for themselves.  Exposures to others will be useful but will not be enough to make learning possible.  3. C: Study.  Learning should come from learning by doing.  Without learning by doing, there will be no way to test what the child knows.  4. D: Cooperation.  Learning should come not only from learning by doing but from studying by thinking through it.  Cooperation can come from a willingness to help others, being curious, and being curious about what others are learning.\n5. E: Thought.  Learning can come from being curious about why people are doing x, y, or z.  Some of the great thinkers during our history, such as Aristotle, have learned by thinking about how others are doing things.  This might not sound very different from exposure but will help to make learning easier.  6. Folding.  Learning will also need to come from being able to see everything in front of them and to recognize things others have done and thought of doing.  If you can't see or realize how someone else has learned, learning is difficult. 7. G: Thinking.  Learning can come not only from doing but thinking about what makes things better and worse.  Learning in a culture that doesn't consider logic, deduction, or thought can be very difficult.\n8. H: Flexibility.  Learning can come at any time and from practically anywhere.  It may take some time to learn a new language but it will help someone if they are willing to take on challenges and to put in the effort to make it work.\nThe final answer to the question is: B \u2013 > E \u2013 > F \u2013 > H\nThe final answer is:\n\nInput: You and your friend are visiting a museum.

{"text": "The total distance running is 6,400 yards. The length of Bob's barefoot heel is 2.625 feet.  He runs at a speed of 3 mph so 5 feet tall is 32 feet.  The distance running of his barefoot heel is 6,400/4 = <<2.625-3mph=18>>18 feet\n Bob's barefoot heel will last 36 feet because of the friction caused when he takes off his socks.  The surface he runs on has a thickness of 1 inch.  It makes a constant wear on his shoes.  If Bob ran at an average speed of 3 mph it takes him 3 hours to break 36 feet.  So 36 \u00d7 3 = 36\n Bob's barefoot run will last 36/4 = 11 seconds for walking and 8.25 seconds for running because of the frictional force between the shoes and the pavement.  If he ran at a speed of 3.9 mph it would take him 27 seconds for walking and 35 seconds for running.\nSo the final amount would be 36 second x 23 hours = $0.0072\n\nInput: A man wants to increase his bank account by $100.

The size of any digital file generally depends on the system being used to create and maintain the. The name of the file often starts with the computer's system identification number. It is possible that an individual system may have multiple copies of a file or other document. An example is an electronic mail file, where a single email file may be stored on multiple computer systems. One way to identify a file is when the file is referenced by its unique file identification number. For example, a document which contains different versions of the same page might have different file names.

In the last school budget year (2016-17) we had a total of $4,931 in budgeted employee pay raises.  My co-worker received a $1,100+ raise.  I'm in a district with $6,000,000 in revenue.  In the last school budget I had a total of $500,000 in budgeted employee pay raise.  My co-workers salary is in the $35,000-$50,000 zone.

I think my co-worker or the school board should consider getting some of the raise to cover higher teacher salaries.  Should I be paid differently based on where I work?  Should I be paid a larger yearly salary?\nOutput: There are 2 pay grades at my elementary grade school.  The average salary for my co-worker is $54,000 and for me is $35,000. I am currently paid in the $55,000-$59,000 range.  My pay increases every year based on my performance evaluation.

So my total raise in the last 5 years is $5,000.  I'm in the middle of the 10th grade, so I hope my pay raises can keep pace with the increased number of students.  Now when the raise comes it does help even more because I have more to spend at the grocery store and gas station and that will push me in my yearly evaluation. We are in the same grade school.

{"text": "The flea locomotive is B. We will calculate the maximum number of points an animal can score with a locomotive.\nOutput: The maximum possible total points is 1144.\nIn the above chart, the fleas' maximum possible total points are 1144 points because they can score as many times as they want per round. The fleas have 2 times as many locomotives as the number of legs means 1 flea can have a total of 1144 locomotives with a maximum score of 1144. The fleas are one round away from their record score of 1144 points per animal because their locomotives can score 10 times as many as the number of legs mean 1 flea can have 12 locomotives with a total of 12 locomotives with the maximum score of 12 locomotives. Therefore, the maximum possible total points for the fleas is 1144.\nOutput: We know that 1144 is the maximum possible number of points since the fleas have 2 locomotives per animal. Therefore, the fleas are in range for the record total they need to score.\nOutput: We also know that 1144 is their record score since the fleas have 10 locomotives per animal and they need to score at least 10 points for that score to equal an 1144 total. Therefore, the flea locomotives are in range for their record total.\n\nInput:The following example is taken from the book \u2018The Joy of Numbers\u2019.

The person gives the person the number 6 which is marked as the first letter and then the number 7. In which case what does the person do?\nOutput: To avoid confusion we will write 6 and 7 next to the board instead.  Since 6 + 7 must be the same as 6 + 7, 5 + 7 must = 7 and 7 must be a multiple of 5, we will read 6 + 7 * 5 = 7.  As 6 + 7 * 5 * 7 must be exactly 6 + 7, we read 11 + 7 * 5 + 7 = 12.  11 is not a multiple of 11, so we cannot take 12 from the 2.\nOutput: The person writes 5 to get 6.

Each box contains six pairs of socks. The socks will be on the first pair. When a player completes a round they walk down the line from one box to the next pair. If two socks are on the same pair on the first pair in the line and one sock on the first pair in that same line when a player completes the round it will be counted.\nOutput:\nThe first box must have a total of 1 pair, the next must have 4 pairs, the next must have 10 pairs, the next must be 90 pairs, the next must hold 70 pairs, the next must contain 5 pairs, the next must start the round with 3 pairs, the next, if a player completes the round with socks, must have 8 pairs of socks, and the last box must have 13 pairs.\nTotal is 300*6 = 1855 socks.\nThe first box must hold 1 pair. Thus, the total of socks is 1855 times 1*2 = 913 socks. Each pair only has a weight of 63 pounds. So each is 3 pounds. That gives each person 33 pairs of socks, thus the total of socks is 33*813 = 1855.\n\nInput:If we can find a specific number of fish within 10 feet of an item, which is more likely to be caught: a) a fish or a catfish b) a pelican c) a duck d) a whale\nOutput:\n1: Catfish\n2: Pelican\n3: Whale\n\nInput:Let\u2019s say that you and 5 other classmates would like to start a private detective club.

{"text": "In addition to the above,  Josh writes,  \u201cToday you have an early birthday!  My mom and I had a wonderful breakfast, cake and card and a fun morning full of good times, love and memories.  I am so happy I could burst!  I love you.  I wish I could be there with you celebrating your milestone.  I think the best way to celebrate this would be an early lunch.\u201d\nThe cake and the card both cost $10 each and a $1.50 card at the post office, so the total cost of the cake and card is $11. The total value of the ingredients on the cake is $1. The total cost of the ingredients on the card is $1. The cake has 100% fruit filling. If the cake was for dessert, the ingredients would cost 2/3 of the costs, however there is no fruit in the card.\nSo in a way the cake was bought using a credit card, but also was homemade, and it is a reminder to him because his parents are divorced that they are still committed. But if he were not married his parents are divorced and even if his mom and dad were not married would be more likely to celebrate his birthday together.\nThe same cake would be very similar but it would not be called \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d because that part is not important and more important is that for him the cake has a message from his dad and mom. Therefore the cake name is still \u201cBirthday!  Happy Birthday!\u201d\nIn another way it is a birthday present to his cousin. The cousin has a birthday in November and Josh would like to spend it with her on this day. But Josh would like to get together with his parents and other family on Thanksgiving so that there can be a full meal and there will not be a lot of leftovers.\nSo in other words, this cake was homemade, it was used to express love and happiness, and it was a birthday present.\nAlso, in the same way, the cake was created for the celebration, it served a message, and it was given as a gift on this day, however the cake, a fruit filling only cake, does not have actual fruit. It is the symbolism of the cake, that it is more meaningful after he gets married because the cake will be part of his life and a memory he gives as a gift. It is more than a cake, it is more a gift, something he gives to someone else with", "answer": "D: happiness"}

His shopping was very good and he didn't need to spend much on any accessories.  During the shopping trip he had 3 deals that gave him a $10 discount to use on additional items.  If he had purchased the items for each individual customer he would make $100.00.

Answers:\nGolf is a game called golf in which the ball gets larger to each one it hits until it hits the ground.\nIn this game, the ball gets larger each time it comes to a stop on the green. All the golf balls start to get bigger until there is enough room inside. If the ball ever hits the ground then it stops growing and goes back to normal size. All the golf balls can fit inside the small box.\nThe golf balls can grow as high as 25 centimeters but never as far as 40 centimeters unless it hits the ground twice. If the ball ever drops below the boxes height then it grows as high as it can. All of the golf balls can fit in a box of 5 or 10 boxes.\nThe golf balls cannot grow as high as 80 centimeters because that would make the ball go to full sphere size. The box would get too large to hold all the golf balls. If the ball drops below 5 or 10 feet then it grows as high back to 3 or 5 feet.\nThe golf balls are not supposed to grow as high until they hit the ground because then they all turn into spheres. If there ever happens to be an accident which causes them to grow, then they grow to a full round spherical size.\nIf ever an accident causes the ball to grow, the ball will explode.\n\nInput:The world", "answer": "C: musical"}

John had $12 for clothes, so he bought the pants on Tuesday for $1, and today it was $1.10 for the pants so he already paid the $3 for this pair.  John also bought 2 shirts, a pair of shorts, shoes and socks.  When he got the pants he checked them once and said that they looked dirty.

A second, but equally important, function of parenting is to guide their behavior and teach them about the consequences of their actions.

George has a total of $5,300 saved, $6,200 of which is an increase of $300 from his savings in December of this year. What is the biggest difference between the savings shown in this month and the savings shown in December?\nOutput: Savings in the month of December were much higher than savings in the month of December. Savings in December were $800 vs $3,700\n$800 x $3,700 = $2,300\n$2,300 x $3,700 x 8 months = $1,600\nSo savings in December were a lot more than this month.\nSo the final total of savings in the month of $2,600 was greater than in December, so it was higher in this than in December.\nSo the final question is\n$2,600\n$2,600 divided by $5,300 = 0.00002\nSo savings in December have been less than saving in this month, but this is a new change for December\n\nInput:The first letter of each month is $0.

{"text": "It's true when they trick women\n\nInput:Marilyn has a big purse. She has only six credit cards. The total credit card debt is $2,000,000. Her monthly repayment of interest and fees is $650. Her credit line is $100K. Which means her interest is $650/month. The amount from her credit line to the balance on her credit cards is equal to her monthly payments less the interest she is paying.\nInput: In the total value of debt outstanding, total interest is $700,000 divided by 30 = 8.0\nInput: Total interest is $800,000 divided by 30 divided by 12 = 10.0\nInput: 12 divided by 30 = 10.0\n\nInput: A farmer is making about $100 per month doing nothing but watching his animals graze. He wants to buy a new barn. The store needs a buyer, the price of the barn plus an annual $100 rental fee will be $12. The farmer has $7,000 in his checking and savings account. He's got $5,000 in cash. The store manager says, \"we'll take 5% on your cash. You're buying barn or we'll take 5% on the truck.\"  The manager doesn't care how he'll lose on the cash, but wants a buyer for the store to move along. George has a truck and he has enough cash to buy the barn. How much does it cost and do they work out the deal? And what about a truck buyer? And what if the truck was in good condition? Does George get $650 on his cash with 4%, or $800 on his cash with 8%? And they only get 10% of the truck.\nOutput: What we have done is made up a number that sounds like it will sound like it will work. It's all numbers and letters. It doesn't matter how much money it is for. If the total would be less than the annual rental of the barn, that's great, but I don't care. Any amount it does cost the farm at that time is a great price. If the total is equal to the annual rental of the truck (about $11k) the farm is a bad deal, but this works if a good price is offered for the barn.\nOutput: This deal can work out well if the cost of the barn is $13k. George buys the barn and with interest of 8%, buys a truck for $11k.", "answer": "E: save money"}

George can only pick 1 of the 3 options.  If he had to select only one, he would choose sunny and he would try to plan out a day of exploring the volcano.  George goes on his trip and he does not find the volcano.  He wakes up and all his planning is gone because the volcano has moved into the middle of the ocean and George cannot plan his trip anymore.  What will happen if he finds out that he has been to the wrong volcano?\nOutput: If George did not pick sunny or did not plan an exploring tour of the volcano, he would still have the same vacation.  He would not know where he went wrong.  He still saw all the volcano scenery he wanted to see.\nGeorge knows he has a dream to visit Hawaii and he knows what he wants to do while there because he has this dream in his night vision.  But he does not know whether the weather in Hawaii would be right for his trip, so he does not know which volcano to visit.\nInput:\nGeorge has 3 options for the volcano trip.  He can visit the volcano for a sunny day.  He can visit for a windy day.  He can have a windy day.\nOutput: In this case, since the volcano is not near the beach, he did not choose a sunsy or windy day.\nGeorge had 3 choices for a Hawaii vacation and he decided on 2 of them.\nSo in the final answer, the volcano is not at either of the beaches and he chooses sunny.\n\nInput: George takes a ferry from Canada into Italy.

A child that is not loved and respected is unhappy.\nOutput: An experiment has been set up to see if a 10 year old can feel love and respect.  The children will need to play several games to get the chance to feel love and respect towards their classmates.  One is called \u201cFingers,\u201d and all children will be required to touch different objects to play. If a child touches a red ball, this will result in pain to the child and a red mark on his finger.  If a child touches a white ball, he will feel love for this white ball much more readily.  Both red and white balls will lead to pain for the child in the future if the child does not touch them and move them.  If children do not feel love for others, then the experiment will not go well.\nInput: The experiment started off nicely enough, but when a boy had to pick out which finger was to be touched by each finger to complete the game, he was unable to choose.  Once again, he picked the one that he least wanted (the red finger).  This time, however, the boy was able to choose which finger to give his prize to, but he still did not get the prize.  Now this did not really matter since he did not get his way very often anyway, but it got him thinking.  So he decided to start all over again, except this time, the red finger would not be picked.  He would give it to the kid that the red finger touched first.  When the red finger touched white ball, he would give them the red finger.\nOutput: When the red ball touched white ball, the boy was", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

{"text": "Sam forgot to bring out his shoes in the entryway so they were in the office building and there were no shoes on the ground when he went and grabbed the shoes.  Who found the shoes on the ground?\n\nInput: In the U.S. The Census Bureau reports the number of people who take out loans after they were late on their credit card payments. The average amount a person is late paying their credit card and in the process of repaying this debt is 11% of her income. The percent of people who owe more to creditors than they have paid after being late is 11% so if the Census Bureau reports 10% of the population owes 11% of their income to credit cards after their last credit card payment was made, then the total debt the nation owes after the debts are repaid in her 50 years is 55%. The percent of the population that has to work to pay debt is 11%. The Census Bureau also reports the total number of people that are in default on a credit card (for non-cash payments) for people over a certain income. The Census Bureau reports that 25% of this population has negative balances at the end of the year. The amount of money the Census Bureau reports as debt at the end of 2014 is $2.4 trillion dollars. Who got the last credit card payment before the Census Bureau\u2019s year?\nOutput: In 2014 only 19% of the credit card debt was paid after the Census Bureau year.  If the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau collected debt and reported it, then the debt would have been equal to $44,000 which is 7% of the total amount of the debt at the end of the last year.  This would make the debt equal to 57% of the amount of debt that was owed at the end of 2014.  The debt owed at the end of the census year would have been $47.4 trillion.\nSo if the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was collecting the debt reported by the Census Bureau, then the total debt that would have been owed at the end of that year after the debts were repaid, would have been $64.8 trillion.\nThe debt that was not repaid would have been 11% of the debt at the Census Bureau\u2019 s and would be 56% of the debt they reported to the government.\nSo this would be 59% of the government\u2019s debt after the debts were repaid.\nSo the final debt is 62% of the total debt, or $72.2 trillion worth of debt.", "answer": "E: house"}

If each pizza sells for $2.50, what are the total of the 3-5-7 pizzas?\nOutput: 2 pizzas are selling for $2 and 3 pizzas are selling for 5 each. 7 pizzas are selling for 10. Then we need to go through all the parts of the pizza sale to find the total. 7 pizzas were selling for 10 each. 5 pizzas were selling for 7 each. Then we need to find the total number of pizzas selling 6 for $10. 10 pizzas were selling for $10. Since we have to figure out which part of the 10 sells for each pizza, we\u2019ll need to figure that out by looking up the amount of each pizzas\u2019 sale to find out the amount of each pizza selling 6 for $10 per piece.\nSo that works out to be 30 pizzas sold, 7 pizzas sold for 10 each, 2 pizzas sold for 2 each, 3 pizzas sold for 5 each. $30 - 7 = $10.\nSince we\u2019ve figured out part one and part two we\u2019ll need $22.50 per pizza in order for us to make a perfect slice.

{"text": "A\nAnswer all the questions.\n\nIf you answered \"A\" or \"C,\" you are learning to give and receive praise in a constructive way. Don't worry about the praise. As I have shown, most of the time I am never even noticed, so all the rest of the time your praise is probably unnecessary. You are not just giving and receiving praise like a robot, you are learning to give praise and receive praise in a positive way. Praise is a gift. It is not a chore, it is not a chore at all. If there are people who don't need any praise, there is no need to give any at all. If you don't need any, who can you praise or reward? They need to be able to notice you, so they will like you. They will need to like you in order to want to praise you and reward you, or else they will avoid you. If there are people around who don't need any more praise or reward, there is no need for you to think of them as \"in need\", so how can they \"in need\" be thought of as \"in need\" for anything? You are helping them become nicer and easier to like by giving and receiving praise. They appreciate you and want to be nice, just the way they are, exactly the way you want them to be. You can find out how to do that through praise by practicing being nice and easy to like.\n\n\"You know there are people who need no more praise, there is no one I can give you who they cannot notice -- why do I do this and always feel guilty about it?\"\n\n\"A\"\n\n\"A\" and \"C\" are all correct.\n\nWhen you practice being nice and easy to be pleased by others, you will make people feel like you do like them and want to be nice right back.

To move to the old factory and become a factory worker 2.) To move to the new factory and become a food factory worker 3.) To be a food worker and produce the food on their own\nOutput: The product is food. There will be two batches produced by every worker according to these 3 options. If they are all in room (A) producing food, then they will be the number 1 in the product output and it is an accurate guess that they will be the only worker producing food at the end.

She started to worry that he was going to cheat on her, and she started looking at women other than her husband.  The husband later tried to make amends with his wife, asking her to go to church with him.  His wife asked him to go back to church with her the next week and he went.  He said his wife doesn't need him to be a pastor in order to love Jesus, but he wanted to be a preacher or a minister of music.  She said no.  They didn\u2019t divorce because his wife believed that being a pastor was better than working full-time.  The husband says she has no self-respect and she\u2019s just trying to make ends meet.  Can you explain why you think she wanted a life outside of her husband?\nOutput: I think the reason for divorce for the husband was for the wife.  She wanted a life outside of him and felt like he wanted it too, but they couldn't be apart.\nThe way to fix this problem is to make every person feel important and loved and secure.  Make every person, man and woman, feel needed and wanted.  No matter what the relationship the person must be loved even if there is bad behavior and no trust.\nThe problem is that you, the person, are looking at every person with a negative attitude only thinking about what you want from them.  You want your people, the people in your relationships to always look at you and say, \"I love you.  You matter.\"  They cannot do that without putting a smile on your face.  Because you, the person are not happy in your relationship, people, the people in the relationship may feel they have no value, even though they love you.  So try to stop thinking selfishly and be more grateful for all those around you.  Do not look at people with a negative attitude.  Instead look at them as they are and what it takes to be the best partner possible in your relationship.\n\nInput: What kind of personality does a person need to have to become successful in sports?

A client can provide money for anything from sexual favors to a roof over his head in exchange for sex. He does not have to take you anyplace or do anything. He can simply call you up and have you perform sexual acts for him. If you cannot find any willing clients, you can work at home with a camera on the bathroom wall. You can also sell your body to a private investigator or a law enforcement agency. There are plenty of sites on the Internet that let women and men post ads. Many times, you can make a large amount of money if you work with enough people until you find your own willing clients. People who have had similar experiences will know how to locate other clients. You can take your time because this income is not typically worth the inconvenience of taking a job. The average monthly earnings for a person who sells their body for sex is around $2000-$4000 per month just from advertising for a few weeks for an adult ad. You could also make a decent amount working for a prostitute or escort service. If a man wants to meet his \"willing client\" at a certain location, you can always call to find out where that person is located. The average hourly wage is around $18-$20. You could also make up to $1000 in a day if you work from home. If you have sex with a client several times per week for a six-month period, you would be making approximately $6000 in the first six months. You must be careful because there are more sting operations done by the U.S. government that hire people like you. If there are no sting operations going on, be careful. However, if you choose to take the risk, you could easily be making a lot more money if you did not have to worry about anything. If you cannot find another", "answer": "C: jar"}

{"text": "Creativity requires space where one can make new forms of expression as well as to process and explore existing forms. Creativity happens in the creative process in which a person must be open to new experiences, to the unexpected, to the unpredictable, to the uncertain, to the change. Creativity makes its way towards its goals when one is comfortable in one\u2019s own skin. When one feels free to be creative, it is much easier to develop a sense of style and individuality which leads one to being able to express one\u2019s own thoughts, feelings, and ideas. One can be creative through the act of doing artistic things such as writing, painting, drawing, or singing. It goes without saying that one can also be creative by listening and by observing others, one\u2019s family, friends, or those in positions of authority. Creative people are always seeking challenges and new opportunities. Creativity does not come easily. Creativity requires an open mind and a willingness to try new experiences for it to grow. Art is a type of communication that allows people to hear the truth and see it beyond the limited image one has of themselves. Without art, we would have no ideas on how to make the world better. Art is a form of communication that allows one to take in all that is around them. Art helps to balance the thoughts, feelings, and values of others and it is not just about us and our ideas.\n\nInput: What does one do to change their personality?

{"text": "Where does the bay always lie on the map of California, i.e. LA and San Francisco. choose A for the answer\n\nInput: George is looking for a beach in Los Angeles. He has to go 4 miles off the coast to find one. He is looking for one in a place called \"Seal Beach.\" He is going to find a beach that is: A: less crowded B: near the ocean C: by the water D: a park E: by the ocean\nOutput:The beach is: A: Los Angeles B: Seal Beach\nGeorge is able to go 4 miles off LA shoreline in Seal Beach and find a location in nearby Seal Beach. So is he wrong or right when he said that Seal Beach is closer to the ocean? The answer is: Neither. George was both wrong when saying \"Seal Beach\" is closer to the ocean AND right when saying \"Seal beach\" is closer to LA.\nInput: How many miles does it cost to buy a new car?\nOutput: The answer is: A-B.\n(i.e. it is a A + C = D)\nThe car is worth $9000 and the price of gasoline is $0.25 per gallon.\nIn total there is $900 in gas costs of which $200 will be used for gasoline and $650 for insurance\nSo the car is worth $4000-$4000=$3200-$2200\nThe total cost of petrol is $4000\nSo $4000 divided by 3200 = $1200 = 60 cents per gallon. So the correct price for the new car is 60 cents per gallon. You can write the new car cost using either: B: fuel C: insurance D: interest\nSo the total cost of the new car is: B= fuel * (120/60)= $12.50 C= insurance * 60C)/(60) = $150 D= interest = $250\nSo the correct answer is $250, or $3,250 less than the new car cost in the other answer\n\nInput: Which of these statements is NOT true?:  \"A is less likely to get cancer than an individual with the same IQ.\"\nOutput: B.\n(i. e. B is less likely to die in a car crash than someone of the same IQ)\nA = less likely to get cancer + less likely to die in car accident = less likely to get Cancer\nB = less likely to get AIDS than someone of the same", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

He now needs to spend $15, making his total $25. That total is $40 + 25 = $55. His total is now $55.  In the final nine rounds, he needs to spend $15 per round, making his total $65.

So, if you give out five beer and get $120, you\u2019d make $120/5 = $300.\nSo that means the person selling beer has made $100 more than the person who gave out beer.\nIt seems to me that it\u2019s safer to give out two beer than five so that you have about $300 in your wallet.

How much time can he commit each day to his sports activities?\nOutput: Each day between 7-9am, he can commit 3-6 hours of his time to his activities.\nSo we can make 3 hours per day per activity, thus 2 hours per sports activity. He can participate in 3 sports activities for the first week of school, then commit 3 hours to 1 of the 2 sports he likes most the next 2 weeks. He could play other sports on weekends if he's not committed to his first sport. The first week, he needs to commit 60 minutes per day for all four activities.\nAfter the first week, he can commit 30 minutes per day per sport.\nAfter the first two weeks, he can commit 20 minutes per day per sport, in addition to the other activities he's already committed to. So we can do 4 sports activities in the first 2 weeks per week.\nAfter 2 weeks, he can commit to 3 sports activities, which puts him at 2.5 hours per day per sport. For the second 2 weeks he can commit only 18 minutes per day per sport and is committed to only 1 sport per week. So he can be at an average of 2.3 hours per day in the second 2 weeks.

She then asked if there was a reason he did not pick up dinner before he left.  He again lied and told her that he did not have time to go out.  This time he lied to her a second time because it was no longer convenient for him to go out when he had time to do the dishes.  There was no need for him to lie.  Therefore there was no lie to her.  Since his mom believed him, he did not have to tell her anymore.  Since his mom told him that there was no need to lie if he could not remember what he did, he may have taken her word at first, but later he began to remember his actions.  Therefore there was a lie to his mom.  He did not have to lie because his mom believed him.  Therefore there was never a second lie.

If they had died on the same day, his parents would have died rich. When can George afford a luxury car like a BMW?\nOutput:George starts earning his annual income of $1000 by age 22.  He turns 21 in 2008 and earns $20,000.  By 2015 he makes $25,000.  By 2013 he is earning $35,000.  He earns a lot more money than his parents did because they did not earn any income in the late 80's and they did not earn enough money to spend their entire savings on a car\nBy 2015, because he is now earning more money than his parents and did not spend his savings, his BMW is 5 years old. So if he had bought it new in 2007, it would have been worth $50,000. So he now has a $60,000 car but cannot afford to buy a new BMW until he earns enough to buy a new BMW before the end of the year. So George will not be able to afford a new BMW in 2017. So the question is what will he purchase a new car for?\nOutput:George will purchase a $50,000 car.\nHe starts earning his annual income in 2007 and earns $20,900.  By 2015 he earns $44,800.  He earns $51,200 in 2008 and $51,800 in 2009.  By 2015 he will make $65,800.\nSo by 2015 he will have a $65,200 car and he will not have the extra income to afford to buy any new luxury cars for the rest of the year. So he will not afford a new luxury car until 2017. So the question now is what will he buy in 2017?\nOutput", "answer": "D: venice"}

Each student has a scholarship they can use to pay for school, tuition and books.  There are five colleges in the same city.  Each college is one hour\u2019s drive away.  Students are allowed to commute to each college one hour per day for work.  If we do this each day, it will take each student three days to get there.  1,200 x 3 = 23,600 students.  This takes 6 days per student per week for school, transportation, 2 hour meals and work.\nOutput: The average weekly time a student needs to spend commuting to their chosen college is approximately 20 minutes.  Since it takes 6 days to get there once per week, that means the average weekly working hour a student needs to spend at their chosen college is 40 minutes per day. These 40 minutes would be used to commute, prepare for class, and attend work if they were to use a bus or a train to get to their chosen college. Since it takes 6 days per week to get to their chosen education if we consider school, transportation, time for work, we can conclude that the average weekly school work time is 5.26 hours. Therefore, these 40 minutes of extra school work time are worth an additional $45.  The total amount of money students should be making through their education is approximately $1,080 per year.\nOutput: The total amount of money saved by these 50 extra school hours for these 20 extra working hours is approximately $350 for these 20 extra working hour. Therefore, students should have an extra $300-$370 for tuition. The total amount of college money students would need to have in their pocket to pay for tuition is $1,380\n\nInput: You have 5 dogs and 2", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

{"text": "they listened to him\n\nInput:Mary and Michael were making a paper cup that would hold 8 coffee cups. They would fill each cup with ice from a freezer. They planned to fill all the cup until the bottom of the cup was a little more than half full. They would then fill the cup about 3/4 full with water. Mary would pour the ice into the cup. Michael would add the water to the bottom, then they would just leave it until it reached the top of the cup. If they wanted to use a lid they could do so. But if they wanted to do without the lid, they could, too. Mary's plan seemed a little sketchy to Michael. He suggested that they plan the layout of the container first so that they could know what was happening. He suggested that they write out their plan. Then he suggested leaving the fridge running every 8-16 hours. This would keep the freezer at a constant temperature. Once day, the ice wouldn't spoil because it would only be exposed to cold air every so often. Mary suggested that Michael get something to keep the freezer door closed to keep the ice cold all day. Michael thought that this would take up too much space. That's when Mary suggested that he could do what Mary did--leave the fridge door open but close the door when not in use. This would keep the ice cold all the time. Michael still disagreed based on past experiences at school with other students who were unable to work in silence. But he was willing to try it. Mary's plan didn't seem to work, and it took longer for Mary to get the ice hot than it did for them to keep it cold. Then, a couple of days later, Michael noticed that the ice was still going. It was still at normal temperature. So, Mary changed her plan again. She suggested that they keep the door closed the first 3/4 of the time so that there wouldn't be a chance of the ice being left exposed. But once they saw that it was safe, they would open the front door. If she didn't warn them, though, Michael said that maybe the door could be opened halfway. This would keep the fridge door slightly warmer. But she said that they could do that when they weren't at school too. They were able to get the ice cold by working in silence. And, the ice stayed cold until the front door was open. Michael and Mary tried it for the first couple of days, but noticed that it was still going even though they", "answer": "C: knowlege"}

{"text": "B\n\nInput:The government has decided to build more homes at the cost of $4 billion. It will take 10 years to complete each home. In the meantime, the government has decided to subsidize $3 million per home and make them affordable. The cost of one home is $150,000. The government offers a 10 year mortgage at $17,500 which results in an annual payment of $26,510. The $30,000 interest is paid every year. What does this average yearly cost add up to, in order to be affordable?\nInput: The government allows buyers to only pay the difference in selling price for their home. The house is priced at the market value. It takes 5 years to complete the home after building. The government offers $3 million for one home in the program.\nOutput: $29,500 * 250 * 10 = $17,510 = $3.3 million\nSo in total only $3.3 million of the $400,000 purchase cost has been covered and $350,000 of the $400,500 purchase cost has not. So the monthly payments will be $25,200.\nThat equates to an annual payment of $12,600\nSo the annual cost is $5,100 = <<23.1-20=23>>5\nIf we add the mortgage payment to $26,510, we will get a total of $46,510. The yearly interest costs for the property are $17,850\nSo the total cost is $11,350\nSo the total annual cost is $30,700\nSo the total annual mortgage payment is $11,500\nSo the yearly interest costs are $22,150\nSo the yearly interest is $12,500\nSo the monthly interest costs are $12,750\nSo the monthly interest is $12,900\nSo the yearly mortgage payments are $24,900\nSo the annual interest is $2,800\nSo the total annual interest is $4,700\nSo the yearly mortgage payment is $28,900\nSo the monthly interest cost is $11,500 so the total yearly mortgage payments are $46,050\nSo the annual interest costs are $7,500,000\nSo the yearly interest cost is $10,000,000 = $40,000\nSo the total yearly interest is $20,000\nSo the annual interest cost is $14,500\nSo the annual interest rate is $0\nSo the annual", "answer": "D: death"}

He cannot find an apartment to rent because he has bad credit and has applied for several apartments but has not heard anything, yet he keeps applying. What can he do to bring his credit up?\nOutput:\nHe could use credit karma,\nor\nhe can go to the state fair and apply for fair housing assistance.\nTo pay for the fair housing application he could get a job at the park and ride system.\nAfter he got an interview with the fair rental agency but after being denied he will also have to go to the employment board. After he is rejected they will send the application application to all his past landlords and see if any of them are willing to take him back. So if he is denied this time he can look at renting from his brother who will give the job to him. The rent will be paid up front at each visit.\nThere are a few companies that will work with him on this because he is trying to get his life back. He is still waiting to hear back from some places. One of those is the hotel and motel he stayed in for one night. He did not rent again there. He plans to ask for some sort of discount in exchange for giving work experience at his brother\u2019s company and working one shift per week. Some places also give him work opportunities outside of work hours, like helping out with the house, yard or whatever is involved in taking care of the place. His brother might also be willing to help out this way.\nThere are a lot of options and the sooner they start trying to move forward, the sooner he will have a place to live. The sooner he gets a job the sooner he can look at getting into school for post-graduate work.\nHis parents will help him by finding work. They will do their best to help him look for a place to rent.\nThis will probably take him a couple of weeks and after that he will have his own apartment.\nWhen asked why they do not work at the hotel and motel George says they didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go, and he can only afford a room for his family for now. He says other people are suffering like he is and he does not want to throw them out", "answer": "D: pleasure"}

He finds a house for sale that's not too far from his work, takes out a mortgage, pays off his debts, hires a builder and gets started. George has 10 months to get his house up to scratch. So far he's completed most things.\nHe completes the first two rooms. The next three rooms look good but he's not done yet. He takes the next two rooms. The three last rooms look good but there's still some things he has to do. As George finishes the last room, the house looks good.\nWhen finished, the house costs $7,000 + mortgage + 2.5% interest + gas and electricity. Before he makes any money, however, George is losing $600 a week. He estimates he needs about $75,000 a year to pay off the mortgage and keep the house in order.\nSo the final price of his house, before mortgage is paid off, is $75,000 + 2.5% house cost + 2.5% mortgage = $75,000 + 12.5% interest = $85,000\nThe house cost will then need $100 a week to live in plus repairs are needed every year. After all these years of doing this, George is making a profit, though.\nThis is the profit from his first 2 years, so the house cost will come to $2,000 per week - 8 - 12 = $200 - $300 = $225\nIf this budget is what he needs to make his first $75,000 profit per year, he has 10 more years left in which he can do this job. With enough money saved, each year he will go through the same budget. The average profit for a household with 10 people and this budget for 10 years is $100,000 per year, so the house cost should come to $2,100.\nSo the answer to the question is $200 per week", "answer": "D: toy store"}

If an employee can complete at least 8 hours a day over the 7 hours, the employee gains the employee quota bonus.  John needs to meet his quota, so he does 9 hours a day per 7 hours.  The employee needs at least 60 hours to get the 60 bonus. He will need 3 to 4 hours to get his bonus, so he does 8 each day over 5 hours.  So the employee has 60+8+3+4=72 hours left over before he must stop working. If he stops working to take care of Buck, he will not lose his bonus.  John needs 60 hours.  If he stops to take care of Buck and goes to school, he would still have enough time left to work the rest of the time he needed to get his quota.

If the cards are all the same (no different players) then every card is worth $3.50. But if each card is worth different amounts of money then the same pack will only be worth a different amount. For example, suppose that you have 2 red and 2 gold 2-card pack.  Every card is worth more money if it is a red card but less if it is a gold card. For example, what is the ratio of value of the two red cards to the value of the two gold cards?\nOutput: (2 - 2) ^ 1 (new card + old card)^ 2 (2 - 2)\nSo the value of the 10 cards will be (2-2)^2, which is less than the current value of each card (2+2).

The puppies eat the entire 12 kittens.\nThe dogs eat the kittens because they don't cost Adam anything, just 12 kittens doesn't cost $8 so he has no need to waste food buying bigger boxes, if he doesn't see 12 kittens then it doesn't cost anything to feed the puppies.\nSo a total of 12 = <<12-8=96>>96 dogs\nSo there isn't a total of 10 cats and 12 dogs, Adam only has 9 so if there were 10 cats and 10 dogs he should see 12\n\nInput:Ben has one cat and four mice.

{"text": "Lindy's answers are correct.\n\ninput: Josh was working all night.  He needed money for 2 pizzas.  The pizza parlor had a late dinner that started at 11 pm for one table, and started at 10 pm for another table.  Josh was given a 40% discount.  What would the total cost per pizza be if Josh bought two pizza's instead?\nOutput: Josh's discount of 40% is 3220.  He buys two pies per hour = 3220 - 160 = 2420\nThe total cost of pizzas = 4820 + 160 = 4840 = <<5020-160=6.50>>6\nThe cost is 3220 + 64 = 4840\nSo he has 1680 - 6 = 1680, or 1680 - 2420 = 60\nSo the total answer is 60\n\ninput: Alex's dog got sick.  Alex put his dog on the couch while he went to the store. Because of the dogs illness Alex had to use an umbrella to drive home. If he is given 20c, and he put his dog in the car's overhead compartments while he was inside the store, he has $20 for the day because he used the umbrella + he has $5 from the pocket money.  If he gave his dog a treat then used the umbrella and put her in the over head compartment as well, then he would only have a $1 bonus.  Because Alex did neither of these things,  the total cost of his treat plus the umbrella added up to $25.  How much is that bonus?\nOutput:  Josh has $25 in his pocket money = $200.  He gave $2 of his pocket money to Alex, meaning Alex will have $2 more, giving an total of $200, giving him $500 in $2 bills.\nJosh will have $500 in $2 paper dollars = $500 in $2 bank bills\nSo the final answer isn't $500\n\nInput: Sarah's boyfriend is a rich guy.

John gets a call at home that his wife is in labor and they are going to go to the hospital.  John asks his boss to hold off on paying his boss until he gets back and they can deal with it together.  Then he gets in a car with his kids and heads to the hospital.  When he arrives at the hospital, his wife is having contractions, but he cannot find the right hospital and the baby is turning into an 8 pound baby she needs more help.  He asks the hospital employees if they have beds without a crib, so he could stay in the car with his kids and they can find a crib for him.  The hospital employees say no, but there is a second floor.  Then John goes back home and continues to work.  When he gets around to calling his boss the next time things go wrong at work, his boss tells him that John will need to take the day off because they need to get their kids out of the hospital. After everything is said and done, the baby was actually a 8 pound girl and they only needed the hospital for an hour.  But now John has to worry about how he will be able to pay his loans.  So does his boss take the day off as well?  Does the boss pay John's bill?  Does John pay his own bill?  The answer is not.  John still has to pay his bill.\nOutput: John got paid the bill. His boss paid his bill. John's boss pays the amount owed to him since he stopped paying. Therefore, both John and his boss are equally responsible for the amount he owes. Therefore, both John AND his boss are equally liable for the amount he owes since there is no possibility he can pay the amount due to neither of them.\n(You might have to read this line several times).\n\nPlease provide multiple choice questions.\n\nFor example:  1.

By definition it takes the force of 10 pounds to push it across 10 feet of track. By force of 10 pounds 10 kgs it weighs 1040 grams. By definition it takes 4 to 5 seconds for it to travel 10 feet. By force of 10 kgs it will still weigh 5.0 grams after moving through the 10 feet of track. So at least 1.8 times the time that it took to move it using 10 pounds would have produced an amount of force equal to exactly twice the force needed to move the whole thing. The force of 10 kg per hour is equal to the force of 10 kg multiplied by 3 times the width of the track.

A passenger on one of his cars, Mary, feels that Tom needs to drive at 65mph. If he is pulled over for going 65mph in a 50mph zone, Mary feels that he should be charged with reckless driving and fined $500. How do they decide how much to fine Tom?\nOutput: The amount they fine Tom is $335 for every time Mary feels that Tom goes a too fast even if the speed limit is 55mph\nTom has three chances to save on his fine.  He starts driving like a cop the first time he is pulled over (if he is getting pulled over).  He takes Mary on a 3 hour shopping trip.  He drives 10 miles one way every day for 10 days.  He drives only for 5 hours every day, only traveling one or two miles each trip.  He stops by a McDonald\u2019s, pays for a Coke, and uses his phone only to call his wife that he loves her, etc.  In this example Tom saves 50% of the fine by driving like a cop the second time, but loses 40% of the fine if Mary decides to drive recklessly the 3rd time\nThis is 24 hours\nThis is 12 hours\nThis is 3 days\nThe average is $335 x 24 = <<$335 x 10= <<10-10=6>>6 hours\nThis is 6,000 hours\n\nInput: A child has three apples and", "answer": "A: injuries"}

If he is leading on an elimination ride for the team, what event does he win?\nOutput: The team loses on the ride if Josh\u2019s rating is high enough he wins. The team gets bonus points if they win if Josh\u2019s score is low enough. The team also gets bonus points in the 3rd and 5th place rides because if Josh\u2019s ratings are high enough, they win. The last ride of the season will determine the team\u2019s ranking.\n\nInput: If they take a week off of rides when everyone else is getting busy, can Josh go on his own? If not, can the next rider do what Josh can\u2019t? (The first, second and third places on the team will be awarded different rewards for their efforts.)\nOutput: On April 10, he will have earned $6 from this month's rides alone.\nSo his total $6 of earned money is $5 + $1 from this month\u2019s rides.\nIf he can do what the next rider can (2nd place) and still get his reward, the top 1 and 2 riders on the team will earn $10 each!\nSo the total for the month is $26 =<<26-30=<>$60\nSo Josh can\u2019t win, but he could spend $60 this month and still get a reward of $10 for finishing 2nd, which will give him enough money to not miss much school.\nSo the total for April is $60 + $10 =<<60-30=$110>>110\nSo Josh can\u2018t have it all, but he can do just enough to earn the $10 reward.\n\nInput:The first person gets 2, the second gets 2, the third gets 1 and the fourth gets 1. The first three riders get $60 each. Now their reward is $60 - $30 = <<60-30=80>>80\nSo their total reward of $60 this month is $60 * 2 = $110\nIf they can do what the first 3 riders did, which is to buy themselves a bike, then Josh would also get 1/3 of their reward and pay less than the first three\nSo the total reward for April is $80 + $30 =\nSo the total reward $120*3=", "answer": "B: have fun"}

How many hours does Mark need to do the lawn work that costs $7.30 per an hour?\nOutput: The amount of hours that Mark will mow for $7.30 per hours does not change. It does not change because his friend can mow the lawn twice a week instead of once or because Luke asks Mark to mow the lawn twice as a favor.  So Mark did not have to work as a favor for Mark. It just saved him $7.30 per lawn hour since Luke pays him $7.30 instead of $10.00 or $16.00 or $32.00 so Mark received a greater benefit for doing the job for his friend.

They may have difficulty seeing shapes that are not as bright as the ones in daylight. In this case, the light they see is dull.\n2) The non colorblind: The color blind people\u2019s perception is poor in certain bright areas while the non color blind person\u2019s perception is excellent in bright areas.  If the light and the color blind person can see different shades of red and blue, the non colorblind person cannot.\n3) The light sensitive: The colorblind person may have trouble distinguishing shades of red and yellow while the light sensitive person can. If light is bright and the colorblind person can see shades of red and yellow, the light sensitive person cannot.\n4) The colorblind: Colorblind people are unable to see colors if they are outside of a certain color range.  Because colorblind people can see light colors but cannot see color altogether, the color blind person cannot see color and must rely on their peripheral vision to see color.\nThe differences in perception between each group are significant and it is possible to confuse one person with another. If a person with a strong colorblind sense of smell or one person who is colorblind can smell another person\u2019s perfume, there is a good chance the same person cannot perceive the same scent in a woman with light sensitivity or in a man with strong colorblind sense of taste.\nColorblind society is often portrayed as \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d.\n\nInput: Tom has a new book with four pictures in it.

{"text": "What do you fill with ink\n\nInput:The game of tennis has been going for 3\u00bd years. It requires the players to carry a ball and serve in a racquet. It also requires the players to make the proper play, for the ball and the racquet to be on the same side of the court before the ball can be struck. Therefore it is sometimes called the game of chess. The players are competing to establish points and end the game as fast as possible. Let's suppose the player wins one of three games. The first one is a tie. The second game is decided by 3 to 2. The last game, if the player wins, is decided by 3 to 1. The winner advances to the next round. Let's suppose the first game lasts 2 minutes, and the rules require that the players reach all 14 points. This gives the players 5\u00bd minutes. They must also have 3 points left, when the game begins on Sunday. The point system has 3 types of points. Each type of point is worth one point. The first type, a point, consists of hitting the ball. The second type, a game point, consists of keeping a racquet in play and hitting the ball out of its court. The third type of point, or a set point, consists of putting the ball in the court.\nThe player with the highest score wins the game and is declared the winner. An automatic win is the player who scores the most points. An automatic loss is the player who has the highest score when the game is over. Note: If there are no automatic wins or losses, the player who scores the highest in the last game wins. It is important to remember this. Also the player who gets the highest number of points in the last game (to be declared winner) does not score the most points for the team in the remaining games. It is a team-wide accomplishment.\n\nInput:Mary has 8 books. She wants to check the weather from each book using the Weather app on her phone.

Since Zach has the last name of Smith and Mary has the last name of Shroeder, how do their firstnames match each other?   Answer:  Shpeter and Smith (the two surnames in a circle) are two letter words, so you can use either spelling, depending on the word. Shpeter and Spen have only one letter in common: the letter \u201cy.\u201d So Smith and Shpeter are two-letter words.  If you put Smith in front of the first name and Shpeter in front of the last name, it will be Spen instead of Shpeter. So if you said the first two words with \u201cSpencer\u201d instead of Smith in place of Shpeter, it is Spencer instead of Spen. So the first two words with Spencer are Spencer Smith and SPEN SPEN. Zach Smith and Mary Shpeter are not two words.  You can combine them, as well as mix and match letters, to get Spen or Shpen. So if Zach Smith is Zach, and Mary Shpen is Mary Smith, you might say Zach Zach Mary Shpen Spen Smith.\n\nInput: Mark wants to get a haircut, but he doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay for it. He gets a haircut off the street. Since nobody charges him extra for the haircut, he pays the price of the haircut. Mark wanted to know what is the highest amount a homeless man can pay for a haircut?  Response:  The highest amount a homeless man could pay for a haircut would be $50, because that\u2019s the highest amount any one person can pay for a haircut. So Mark would pay $50 on his own because he doesn\u2019t know the street price. But if someone else wanted the haircut, Mark would pay whatever it cost. So the highest amount Mark would pay for a haircut is $50 + street + homeless = $<<$50-homenewhaircut>>50 haircut so: Mark would pay $50 + $homenewhaircut = $<<50-homenew haircut>>50 dollar haircut\nInput: Mark wants an extra $10.

Options:  The apple store has the best selection. Why?  The apple store has a bigger selection because they are smaller. So many people shop the apple store. The apple store has more variety and the employees don't get bored.  Apple trees are better than other trees. Apples ripen on trees instead of vines.  The apple trees are usually in the front. The store in town has the best apples because they are bigger.  A farm has the best apples because there isn't a lot of fruit.  The apple market is the best because they have a lot of variety and the prices are the highest. The apples are in one section but they have a selection. They are organized by price and the price is fixed.  The farmer can set different prices for different produce. The farmer sells at different prices and when people come to the apple market they can find a good deal.  The farmer doesn't have to pack apples very carefully. The farmer can get apples as small as a teaspoon or as big as an entire cantaloupe.  The farmer doesn\u2019t have to pack the apples very carefully because apples ripen quickly.  The apple doesn\u2019t ripen slowly.  The apples are perfect for baking or for using for a salad or apple pie.  Since apples ripen quickly, they are easy to get.  The farmer doesn?t pack perfect apples very well.  Since apples don't ripen slowly, it is difficult to eat.  When the apples ripen slowly, it doesn't take long before they are rotten.  The apple doesn't ripen very well as a result.  The apples aren't easy to find.  The farmer doesn?\"t have to get the apples from a big orchard.  The farmer doesn'  have to buy apples from an apple farmer. There are many varieties", "answer": "B: wine press"}

{"text": "The stale aroma coming from the kitchen is most definitely coming from the bathroom and should be checked in the bathroom with a toothbrush, but the sink is also likely to have a stale aroma.  George checks in the bathroom because it is the easiest place to clean. As far as checking the cupboard or space shuttle, neither smells stale enough to be confirmed. In the living room, George checks the room that is closest to the kitchen as being closest to the stinky kitchen. He discovers that there is also a stale aroma coming from the space shuttle. So in the living room he checks the wall that faces towards the kitchen and the wall closest to the bathroom. The wall closest to the bathroom smells less stale than the wall nearest the kitchen. George uses a toothbrush and air freshener to check the cupboard and space shuttle. The toothbrush smells fresher in the bathroom than other air freshener he has tried. He also uses a window cleaner to freshen up the outside of the window and on some of the curtains. The space shuttle smells fresher than some of the other cleaners he has used. George says that he hopes the stench of the stale water bottle, coffee mug and sandwich bag is in the bathroom. He also says that he looks under the sink to see if there is something that smells and finds a stale air freshener on the sink.  George does the same with the cupboard and finds that it is dirty and not fresh.  The stale air freshener must be in the bathroom or the window cleaner freshener would also have to be placed by the windowsill, because in the space shuttle there is no window cleaner there. He checks the sink and finds that it is clean. He thinks the stale aroma coming from the food is coming from the fridge freezer. However, if it is not from the fridge freezer, why would the stale air freshener smell fresher in the kitchen than it does in the living room?\nOutput: George finds that fresh air freshener is in the bathroom.  The stale aroma from the food coming from food, coffee mug and sandwich bags is not there. George then checks the refrigerator freezer and finds both freshener and freshener bottles.

Using a ruler is easy; each stick should have a point that is the same length as its weight. If we were to see two different sticks with the same weight (both 4 sticks each), which stick would have the longer distance from its point to the ruler?(The shorter stick has a greater point from its point to the tip of the ruler.)\nInput:B is 2 sticks. Each 2 sticks have the same amount of weight with the same length. One 2 sticks is made of 9 and the other 2 sticks of 10. How long can each stick be measured?\nOutput:B is 4 / 2 = 2.75\nB will be 2.75/9 = 1.25 less than its weight therefore the shorter stick has a greater distance to the tip of the marker.\nInput:B is 0.5 sticks. Each 0.5 stick is made of the same weight and length. How long can each 0.5 stick be measured?\noutput:B is 5/2 = 2.25\nB will be 2 / 0.5 == 1 so it has a 3/2 length.

Also, because the food was cold, he threw up 2 pieces of toast.\nSo, after breakfast, Bradley ate 3 pieces of toast, 2 eggs, and a couple ounces of milk to get his nutrition.\nThen Bradley ate the remaining 2 slices of toast and 1 egg.\nThis makes 36 servings of food.  Bradley did not throw up the food because it was not enough. He had 5 servings of food left.\nThe total daily food requirement for breakfast, lunch and dinner is 168 servings.

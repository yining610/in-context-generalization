{"text": "town Y: town B: hotel\n\nAnswer: B.  The town/city for that restaurant is going to have much more than just a local address.\n\nThe problem with the quiz is that questions 1,2,3,4,7 & 8 ask for \"total money,\" while question 6 asks for \"total hours\" (or what time they spent) and question 6 & 7 ask for \"total amount of money\" (or what time it took to earn a particular amount by an activity). So if you try to answer question 1 by figuring out how much money it cost, you'll get it wrong - the answer is $0.00. As to question 2, you really just need to make sure you know how many hours it took them to earn their total dollars. As to question 3, the answer is $0 but if you answer by knowing that the total dollars needed to pay for lunch, then question 7 doesn't matter at all because the total dollars would have been $69 plus the cost of the coupon, so even $1 of the $70 is a question you have to solve first. Questions 4,5, and 6 aren't really math puzzles, because they are asking whether someone spent $1 of their $0.00 of allowance to buy cookies. To take you through the math of the problems, you should start looking at the questions you answered before you start solving questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nThe math puzzle section of the quiz is for elementary and middle school math students. It is especially good for students who only do a little of the arithmetic involved in the problems in first grade and high school classes are usually more advanced and use more advanced math than grade school math. If you do any of the problem sets in first grade or high school you should come back to this problem section and practice the math before you come back and take the second quiz as well.", "answer": "D: business sector"}

John agreed. John had never been married before and he was frightened. He asked Mary to promise not to ask him to marry another woman. Mary pledged to their agreement and John finally decided to get married! The two became very happy and they had a son together.

The amount of likes is called the \"like count\" and students can get more likes by performing certain activities. For example, some teachers will tell their students that when they write a paper, they will get a 50% like count. This means that, to get a 50 percent like count on their paper, students must write 50 words or 200 words. If they write 400 words however the like count will decrease. If they write 700 words however the like count increases. When they write 2000 words however the like count decreases. At the end of the school year, the class will write a summary of their favorite activities from the past year. If the \u201clike count\u201d isn't high enough, the writer will get a \u201clike penalty.'

I chose to use the different colors of the letter A. I went with red to start with and then changed it a little by switching up some of the letters. I had to figure out which A to use in every picture. In my pictures I used the pictures of the letter: A, B, C, E etc. Then I would label those letters in order from left to right.\n\nAssay 3 - There was a project where we had to find a single word in the text and write it in our best handwriting. I used red to figure out what the word was. I chose \"bodily fluids.\"\n\nAssay 3:\nA. Red letters with A-Z and I\u2019ve, he, she, it or it\u2019s are the \u201cbodily fluids\u201d.\nB.

The dog turns around quickly when the man stops but continues to lick him while standing there.

Both dogs start licking the other dog but the dog stops licking and takes out its tongue to lick the man\u2019s upper lip.

It wanders off while running after other dogs. The dogs begin to chase the other dogs and eventually run out of the area. The old man is shocked by the story and tells everyone else who is standing at the stop sign to also think about the dog when they have a food craving. But instead of going up to the dog and licking it, the man walks to the other dog and starts trying to get it to lick his lips. Before he knows it, he\u2019s trying to get the dog to lick his neck. In the end the dog starts to lick the man\u201ds tongue so it finally learns to avoid him while licking other dogs.\n\nNow, I want you to use either a list, word search, or a memory task such as a puzzle", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

{"text": "free time\n\nComments\n\nIf the parent asked you to draw a diagram that depicts your parents relationship, you could do so by drawing out a box and writing down how each parent fills it. Then, each parent could fill in the rest of the box on each side of the line, as the line proceeds and stops at the other side. You can finish by drawing a new line connecting the two ends. I hope you can identify with this problem.\n\nTo write this problem, you need to be aware of key statistics that describe the relationship between siblings. If you're not sure why you need to know these statistics, ask someone you know who is a parent for some insights. The key statistic of the last sentence of the last paragraph is \"How much money did Zach earn before he could save up enough money to buy a car?\" The key statistic in the first sentence is \"How much money per day does he save up during the summers in order to save enough money to afford a brand new bike?\" If you want to know how much money your sibling uses per day, subtract the answer from the amount of money your parent earns per day. You need to know how much financial security your sibling is looking for; thus, you must use the total amount of money your parent has in order to calculate how much your sibling needs to save up in order to achieve financial security. The key statistic you need to know in order to give the correct answer in this problem is the total income your parent has gained per year, per child. Then, using that total income, find the correct answer.\n\nThe first sentence of problem #3 reads: \"How many times should you babysit a 2 year old for a friend for $7 and $7 per hour.\"\n\nYou first need to decide whether your children are your friends. If you do not know if your children are your friends, I advise you to do so. By reading the answer of problem 3 multiple times, you should be able to tell if Zachary\u2019s mom is his mother or her mother. This is very important because when you do work with your child, you should know who is a parent and who is their friend. Zachary\u2019s mother will pay him an extra two dollars per hour if he helps her do his homework while she is babysitting him. Zachary\u2019S is asking his parents to pay for lunch. Once they pay for lunch, he gets to use his allowance to go to the mall with his mom and purchase a hat", "answer": "D: legal fees"}

Another example is the teacher asks another student to write down her name and teacher.

How many parents do these five need, for a childcare assistance fee of $10 per hour, to help fill the childcare gap?\nOutput: 36\n\n* The correct answer is: 6-0-8\n\n* The incorrect answer is: 6-1-2\n\nComment: We now know how to use the number 8 if we have a problem with the number 6 :-D\n\nSolution:In general the correct answer is the first one.\n\nIf you only have 2 students for class, it is easiest to give each of them a 50c calculator to help solve problems. There are some problems that don't need a calculator, but generally it helps make things more convenient.\n\nSometimes the answer is as simply as giving someone a blank calculator and a few loose pieces of paper. That will make it much easier for them to understand equations, or how to answer questions. Other times it can still be nice to give them a calculator, but they can still solve the problem just fine (or maybe better).\n\nWhen there is a lot of work to be done, it is often a good idea to have a number of helpers. They will help keep the rest of the class in check, they can do extra work together on problems, and they can even do a good job of grading problems if there is no other help.\n\nIt is also helpful if you have a few helpers that know the material fairly well. That can really make life easier on you. With that many students, it can be a challenge when you only know how to teach so many of them. Maybe you should have another teacher and a helper come in on the weekends with the students they aren't teaching to help explain problems. You can also talk to the helper and see how they feel about the subject and see if they might be willing to help a student when they think you're on a little bit of a lecture roll.\n\nSome students need some extra help, but overall it depends on the particular subject and the student.\n\nIf you have a lot", "answer": "D: school together"}

{"text": "A: joy = joy - happiness  B: valuable = more happiness  C: happiness + early death = Happiness  E: adventurous = fun\n\nSuggested Answer\n\nExplanation 1:  A: Joy = feeling good, positive, happy is in the brain and you feel good when you get a gift with a lot of value. The feeling good is not a requirement to go out or do something because there is a difference of joy from what comes to us from inside and outside things.\nB:  Value = the satisfaction from something we have in our mind, this is the core of what we get from living. We do not have the feeling to enjoy a lot of the satisfaction from our life because there is not a necessity for it. We have these feeling only when we get excited or happy with a lot of things in our life. You can not have all these feelings when you are alone. It would be better if we could talk to everybody we have and feel all the emotions that we are feeling at the same time. It would be good for everyone because the problem with joyfulness is that we are not always alone.\n\nExplanation 2:  A:  Joy - feelings of happiness and satisfaction are also in the brain of the brain and they take a lot of effort to bring back joy. It is important that we feel joy and satisfaction when we are doing something else to feel good. I have seen some people who are always going around for joy instead of being happy with nothing else in their life. They try so hard to make themself happy that they start to hate and be unhappy with everything in their life. When people feel happy about something, they love it a lot because they feel alive. We live our whole lives living a life because we feel that everything is OK at times. We would not be able to be happy if everything happens to be good at times because we can not feel alive if everything is not OK.\n\nExplanations 3 and 4\n\nA: This is true happiness, this is not feeling good, but it is being happy with the value of your feeling good. This is the meaning that some people see when they go for a cup of coffee, a lot of people will not like their cup of coffee because its not a good cup of coffee. But the meaning of the word \u2018coffee\u2019 is that we are not really that good at it but we enjoy doing it. This is happiness because we are happy with our cup, the", "answer": "A: joy"}

She couldn't understand him. She gave him $5 cash.  She noticed that the homeless man looked pretty unhappy so she ran a few feet and asked him if he needed any help. The homeless man looked at her and went back to begging for money, asking to trade his backpack for a sandwich.  Mary noticed this for a couple of minutes and then ran over, grabbed his backpack, and gave him a nice, warm sandwich.  She saw another homeless man down by the river near an overpass asking for money, but refused.  He didn't want to look at the money and she didn't need any, so they kept walking.  Mary felt very sorry for the one she had robbed, and the other two homeless had no interest in helping him.  They seemed to appreciate being touched by someone who cared.  So, she continued to walk along a nearby road, making small talk with a couple of other passengers.  She was planning on going back into town a short time later to pay the $2.00 toll to get back to her car.  As she looked down and saw a lady in a wheelchair, she pulled over again and asked if she could give the lady her money.  The woman looked very upset so she gave her $20.00 dollar bill, asking if she could also get off of the wheelchair.  The woman and Mary continued to talk for a while, and Mary decided to take her change.  Then she glanced around the carousel and saw a very cute looking puppy.  She put the money in the woman's pocket and turned around to see a young man holding the puppy with one hand and his other hand wrapped around his girlfriend's ankle.  Mary asked the puppy's owner how much she wanted for the puppy.  She gave the puppy's owner the amount she wanted to give him for it.  The puppy's owner seemed happy with her kindness.  The puppy's family seemed pleased with having a new member.

If they earn over $100 in compensation for the year then they can go forward or backward plus 7% which means they will keep 50%.

If they make more than $20,000 the company will deduct their whole salary from their compensation which will leave them with.065% of their salary. If someone earns more than 25% of $20,000, the company will reduce their total compensation to 0.065% of their total salary.  If they make less than 25% of $10,000, the company increases their total compensation to 2.065% of total income.  If they do not make $50 then the company will reduce their comp by 2.065% and they will have no compensation on their 401(k).

{"text": "4\n\nIn many situations the response might be A,B,D and if the kids will listen to an authoritative figure. However, in these situations the response might be either C,E or just A. The word D is usually associated with authority, so A seems to work the other way. Parents would prefer to talk calmly and not yell to control or guide children. So the appropriate response is usually A. However, the other way around might also work too.\n\nWhat is true of many things, as they relate to the topic of a lesson (a task or activity) can be true of all things a child or a parent can do with their child or do as a parent. What is a teacher doing, as an integral component to a lesson (or task), can be true across any task or activity. The teacher also has access to different resources that can be used and different ways to solve challenging situations, as an integral component of a lesson (or task). In other cases the teacher is usually restricted to only one resource that they are required to use (or use as their preferred response for a particular task or activity). This restricted or limited resource is not part of the overall task or activity, so the teacher is restricted in their capacity to relate to and connect with a child across multiple resources. This does not mean that an educator is bad for using one resource, and some teachers might choose to use at least one resource when the tasks or activity at hand are in a learning-based setting or when it is beneficial to do so.\n\nTeachers make most of their decisions across several resources, many of which are part of a larger approach/strategy. In order to make certain decisions a teacher requires the input of other teachers, parents, or other adults. However, in situations that don\u2019t involve these resources and that have less impact on the student, teachers will make the decisions and use the resources they may utilize across all tasks and activities. In situations like these teachers might ask parents to provide some input on the task or activity. This might be to suggest specific books, websites, toys, or activities that the student might do in order to achieve a specific task. Sometimes there is only one resource that the student could use and if the student doesn\u2019t have access to that resource or doesn\u2019t know how the resource can be used, the parent or another resource-aware adult might be able to help the student access the resource if access is not possible.

One of the movies he chose is   The Descendants 2, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, or Moulin Rouge.  Zachary has never seen either movie previously. What is the story/plot about these movies?\nInput: The Hobbit: An Uprising (The Descendants 2)The Descendants 2\n\nResponse: The Descendants 2 is a sequel to one of my favorite Disney movies: The Lion King.  The storyline for both movies follows a family of bears (one male and two females) as they struggle to adapt to life on the outside.  They become orphans after the tragic death of their family.  Both the Lion King and The Descendants 2 use the animal theme because they involve animals in the plot.  The movies are filled with characters who have a lot of adventure, but also have emotional stories.  Their life is difficult with several challenges that occur throughout the movie.  In both movies, there are also interesting twists and turns to the storyline.  They have heart-wrenching scenes involving some of the characters that viewers cannot forget.  They have a happy ending because they have help from the friends and family who are there alongside them.  It is one of the best Disney movies yet, and it will give you a huge feeling of happiness.  However, The Descendants 2 has a plot twist that will hit you hard.  The main plot twist is about the death of one of the characters.  The father of the bear, Mufasa, dies suddenly.  He dies peacefully, but with a shock from the bears.  The bears were afraid because they had never seen their father die before.  With the death of Mufasa, the bear cubs had to adapt to life on their own.  They felt lonely, but they were able to grow stronger by overcoming all these challenges.\nOutput: 13\n\nThe first choice you've made here is not a real response.

The other fish waits until the fish in the pond falls asleep, then eats it.  What is a common tactic the fish use to trap fish? Answers:\n\nInput: Fish have many defensive mechanisms to protect themselves. A lot of times, a fish will jump right into your hand if you touch it. A fish will fight you to the death if you try to catch it. Some fish can move faster than you.  A fish will spit a mucus out that can make things taste bad.  A fish will fight a person and bite that person if you pick it up. A fish will bite a person if it is a larger fish.  A fish will use its teeth to catch prey.  The fish in the pond caught the fish that had been hiding in the shallow marsh.  The fish that had been hiding will crawl up and down the marsh.  The fish under the marsh will crawl above the marsh and bite the fish in the back of the head.  The fish that has been hiding will crawl back up to the marsh and bite the catfish in the face.  Some fish will chase the prey around the pond then return to the pond and fight you until you have nothing left to catch.  Another type of fish that does this is jumping rocks and waiting for a big drop to jump up and bite the top of the rocks.  Sometimes the fish will grab the prey and drag it to whatever is in the shallow marsh.\nOutput: None\n\nInput:The fish that you caught has to be eaten by tomorrow. The person, animal, or plant that you ate today must be killed by tomorrow. The plant that you killed must be killed by tomorrow if it was on your face by the end of today. The fish that you killed and the fish that you lost to you and the plant that you killed must have at least half each of their parts eaten by tomorrow. What do you do with the fish, plant, and animal left over by tomorrow? (Answer: No, you put it back into the same pond. Put it back in the water. Put it in the trash. Put it into a freezer or refrigerator if you need to. You could also put it in a big vat and feed it to whatever you find under the pond while searching for other fish.)\nOutput: None\n[", "answer": "B: two ears"}

The activity only focuses on how we experience multiple choices while in reality \"the problem of choice,\" can be seen simultaneously in a situation in which both choices and consequences are given to us but only \"one of the solutions will be good enough.\" However, \"the problem of choice doesn't take precedence over the actual problems the participants face.\" In this case, the participant doesn't make the choices in the situation the experiment is about. Also, \"the experiment doesn't really analyze if we actually have to make choices because the results are irrelevant to the participant's experience of the dilemma.\"\n\nQuestion 8 - What is an example of a non-problem of choice?\n\nAnswer\nOne example of a problem of choice is when choosing a destination for a trip. If you are at a hotel and they have a brochure, you can choose to stay there only if it's what you would choose if you were doing it all by yourself. But when it comes to taking the bus to a restaurant that doesn't have a buffet table, the bus is not going there all by itself. When you buy plane tickets to some place, you may not necessarily be making the choices yourself, but there definitely must be other factors that are brought into play. When choosing schools, these other factors may even be different from the ones that you can experience alone at home. So, it is important to take other issues into consideration when choosing a job or even a vacation.\n\nQuestion 13 - If you could play a situation out as a hypothetical, what would your outcome be?\n\nAnswer\nI would choose to make my own decisions in several situations. But one of them would be when shopping. I would try to", "answer": "E: read book"}

{"text": "D\n\nComments\n\nHi! I'm one of the authors. I appreciate your interest in this game.\n\nThe game is based around an idea that some of the kids get when they have the teacher's phone number. The idea is to give yourself the phone number and call the teacher when they come to school. You could call every day until you figured out how to get the teacher's number or you could work together with the kids to figure out the most efficient way to get the teacher's phone number (it would depend on the school, the kids, and how many students the teacher was dealing with each day).\n\nThe game was designed for K-5 students so it is really for kids who have phones in school. However, if you are in school and you have a phone that has a data card, I hope you give it a shot.", "answer": "A: school children"}

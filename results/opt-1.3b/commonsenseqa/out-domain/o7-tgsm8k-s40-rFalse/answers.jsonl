Then, take out the stuffing tape. Press your hands into the holes very lightly and work in little circles. You can feel the air moving. This is your air pressure gauge. Hold the paperclips in this position for three minutes.\nTo check and see if your air pressure is safe, place your finger in your closed thumb. If the air feels tight, there is enough air in the tube to keep your finger moist and moist enough not to melt the packing tape.\n\n2) Now remove the packing tape and look at your air tube. It should be about one-half inch (inch) long, about one-third (3/4) inch (1 inch) deep and about one-third inch (1 inch) wide. Now it is time to check the valve. Now remove the cap from the air tube. In the cap you will see a small valve, one inch in diameter and one-halfinch in the center. Use the two small round end of the cap and pinch the valve in place against the rim of your tube until it is sealed tight. Check the outside of the tube against your finger and feel for pressure (see 1).\nNow check the inside face of the tube against your wrist and feel for pressure. It should be a small amount of pressure at this position.\n\nYour gauge for air pressure is good.\n\n3) Take another paperclip now and this time use only 2 ends of the clip and a single round end. Push the air out of your hand. Check on the outside and inside of the tube. You should still be able to feel the air moving slightly. This is a pressure gauge.\n\n4) Using a magnifying glass and some tape, measure two paperclips next to each other. You can now feel the air moving through the tube. This is a resistance gauge. Your air pump requires some resistance to help air pump.\n\n5) Next, take another sharpie marker and mark the outside face of the air pressure tube for each time you filled or emptied your tube. Then use a small flat head screwdriver or one of those wrenches with a screwdriver tip and rotate each marker to a different time. Record the time each marker is marked.

What are the odds of these numbers being in the range of a given sum?  The following numbers are 7 and 8.  What are the chances of these numbers being in a random order?  The following numbers have the same order as those.  The following numbers have opposite order as those.  Let's calculate the probability of each number.  Let's figure out the probability for the middle number first.  Then let's see if it would have made sense to calculate it from the order of the other numbers and then from the total number of digits in the middle number.  We start with the middle number, since it has the same order as both of the \"odd\" numbers. Let's see if the middle-number probability will be bigger than the odd-number \"odd\" probability.  Then let's calculate the odds that the middle-number probability is higher than the odd-number probability.  And let's see if it's bigger than the sum of the other numbers.  Let's use the above-sum rule to calculate the odds for the middle-number \"even\" probability.  Let's see if it will be bigger than the sum of any of the sum probabilities.  Let's use a random number generator and see if we can find a number that doesn't have the same order as all the number possibilities that the second column has.\nOutput: 7/11 + 8/11 = 11/11\n\nInput: When a house moves 10 feet, all of the windows move 10 feet with it.

Why is the large plane flying faster?\nOutput: 500 miles = 5 hours in miles x 24 = 2 hours and 55 minutes.  So it is flown in 1 hour\nOutput: 300 miles = 20 hours in miles = 1 \u00bd hours and 18 minutes.  So it took 2 \u00bd hours to fly all the way from one end of the country to the other end of the country.  So it took 35 hours to fly all the distance of 2 \u00bd hours\nOutput: 4 hours x 35 = 4 hours and 30 minutes.  So it flew 10 hours to the other part of the country. I have not been flying in a plane, but it always seems to take longer to fly by plane than by car...\nOutput: 2 hours and 15 minutes.  So it would take 32 hours to reach the other side of the country.  It also would take about 10 days to get there by boat.  So it would be about 25 days\nOutput: 12 hours x 12 = 15 hours and 45 minutes.  So it must be at least 40 hours to reach the other part of the other side of the other country.  So it would only be 13 days to reach the other part\nOutput: 2 hours x 24 = 48 hours.  So it is 7 days long to get there from the other side of the river. Do I need to go there in an hour? or do I need to fly around it for 6 hours.  So it took 7 hours to drive around the 2 hours you did\nOutput: 2 hours & 20 minutes.  So it costed me 2 days to get there.\nOutput: 6 hours x 24 + 4 hours = 10 hours.  So it takes 20 hours to get there.  So if it took 20 hours to drive there I should take 36 hours to get there\nOutput: 10 hours\nOutput: 5 hours\nOutput: 4 hrs\nOutput: 4 hrs & 30 min\nOutput: 4 hrs and 20 mins\nOutput: 2 hrs\nOutput: 4 hours & 35 min\nOutput: 25 mins\n\nInput: The average speed of a small plane over land is about 17 miles per hour.

So the shadows lengthen by the amount from -5 to -4.\n\nC: This is a pretty long word. Could either \"food\" or \"refrigeration\" be used?\n\nD: Just write \"a\" instead of \"a\" for the \"shadows\".\n\nSolution:\n\nA: -5\nC: \"refrigeration\"\nD: \"food\"\nE: \"A\" seems to be a better choice than \"A\" for the \"shadings\"\n\n\"The shadows lengthen 1\", so when I write \"5\" instead of \"5\", then the length of the shadows lengthens by 5. But you could have made \"6\" instead of \"6\". Because you need to have 5 shadows in order to define an equal distance between 2 points.\n\n\"5\" is 3 times longer than \"7\", so when I write 5 \"shadows\" instead of 7 \"shadows\", then the length of \"shadows\" lengthens by 3. But that changes things if the second \"shadows\" refers to \"0\" (not 5). So it works better to write 4 \"shadows\" instead \"7\".", "answer": "C: freezer"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput: 1.   How long are the hours of darkness?  2.   What is the difference between the hours of darkness and the hour of first light (sunrise)?  3.   The first sunrise occurs as the sun crosses the celestial equator, when the north and south poles of the planet are aligned. Sunspots are produced and can be seen as orange-red rings in the sun's rays. But sunspots usually move across the sky.  Why is sunrise the earliest part of the day, the sun moving around the equator?  4.    It is not always possible to determine the exact time the sun rises in the Pacific region, where it is nearly dark, over other parts of the world. Why?   5.   The solar-orbiting telescope has two lenses for the imaging optics. The telescope's focus is not completely on an object, but focuses on the area of the object's reflection. In contrast, a telescope's focus is on an entire hemisphere of an object by looking at the image reflected from that hemisphere.   6.   The telescope focuses and imitates the Sun by looking at the planets.   7.   In a telescope, light always comes from the eye of the Sun, rather than from a separate lens, so the direction of the sun's rays always corresponds to the direction of the eye of the Sun. 8.   The Sun never appears to rise directly overhead - it appears to be a crescent rising behind a bright moon, due to the earth's gravity. This may be the most popular definition of the word sunrise - see the explanation for crescent in the definition above - however sunrise is an appropriate general term. The crescent is just one example of when a \"sunrise\" occurs.\n\nInput\n1.   How long will it be until the sun rises after the hour of first light?  2.

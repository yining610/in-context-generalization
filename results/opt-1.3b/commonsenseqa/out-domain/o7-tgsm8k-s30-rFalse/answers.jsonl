(There is an alternative to \"the ladder of power.\"  \"The ladder of responsibility\" is better because it is more accurate.)  1. If a problem occurs at the root (management), then all the workers who work below may be unable to solve the problem and may require that higher management be called to assist.  2. When a higher level of management is involved, all of the workers may experience a decrease in their pay and opportunities.  3. When higher level of management is called in to solve a problem, several workers become affected by the solution and may require compensation. 4. When a solution is achieved, and all of the workers may receive compensation for the cost of labor, a new problem may erupt. 5. When the workers are rewarded when a solution is achieved, they may not work to exceed the level of reward, and in fact may even attempt to limit their level of experience in order to avoid rewards that are too high.  6. When a lower level of management is involved in a problem, the workers may feel that the solution gives them a superior level of status and will encourage them to continue performing with poor effort and poor results.\nOutput: 6\n\nInput: What are the advantages of the government program? 1.

He\u2019d like to have enough corn at each location to harvest at least one bushel of corn that would sell for $4.50 per bushel.  So the farmer wants to plant at least two different locations of corn.  The first location that he plants, is the location where he plants the third row of corn, but he only plants one bushel at each location.  The farmer thinks that he may get two bushels for each of his planted locations, but each location only yields one bushel for each bushel of corn.

If at least one bushel per row lands in each location of corn, he gets at least 9 bushels per row.

How many houses would Joseph need if he wanted to buy one house (or 100)?\nOutput: 100\n\nInput: The annual mortgage payment on a house is $50,000.  It costs $15,000 to have new windows installed; a new roof and $10,000 to have new siding installed.  If each window and roof were built and installed at a $10,000 cost per window, each house would cost $2,000.  If each new house was a million-dollar house with 12 bedrooms, all of them would cost $8,000 each.  If each house cost each family $800 to $1,200 per month (to be paid over a month), the family would need $900,000 to $1,200,000 per month to pay the mortgage on the house.  How many months would that take the family?  10 months at $800 each month to save that amount, or 100 \u2013 200 \u2013 300 months between $800 per month and $20,000 per month.

How many new homes would Joseph build or remodel if they wanted 12, 15, or 20 bedrooms?  How much would they rent instead?  If they went to a 3 bedroom house with a 4 car garage and rented out 2 bedrooms to make the 3rd bedroom a study (for a total cost of $1,000 per month), Joe and Mary would need to buy a house worth $700,000.  At that price the mortgage wouldn\u2019t be needed.  Could they pay it all with money from their savings?  Then that would make 3 housing projects: two for their income, and one for the mortgage.

Assuming an annual interest rate of 2% per year, the cost of paying off the loan will be $5.25 in 1971 and $4.75 in 1979.  If an interest rate of 10% per year is assumed at $3,000, the cost of paying the loan will be $3,000 in 1972 and $2,600 in 1979.  Suppose all the interest is included in the loan amount by calculating at a 7% annual rate.  The son will pay $7,375, and even if he has 5% more income than in 1970, the cost will be the same.  There will be a total of $18,000 in payments that will cause the loan to have a net present value of $15,000.\nOutput: $500\n\nInput: Mary Ellen lives in a small house on the farm.

{"text": "7 E\n(This task should not be more than 5 minutes and must include multiple choice answers only)\n\nInput: The following are the rules of the World Series: if there are both a home run and a double play, neither are counted as an infield hit and one of them will be ruled out, as in the strike zone. On the other hand, if a base runner steps on third (including himself), he can be considered safe for home and one out will be counted. Thus, the following are the rules of double plays:  When a man touches home plate, he is forced to stay on the bag and any player on that side has to call out home to the base runner, and anyone running past the out-runner does not have to call this out. Then, once the runner on home plate completes the tag, he is safe for home and one batter will be out. Thus, the following set of rules are the definition of an infield hit when a base runner does not attempt to steal :  A base runner does not have an instant chance to steal second or third if he does not want to;  If he tries to steal second or third immediately after touching home plate, an umpire makes him stay on the bag until he finishes the tag  If he tries to go for third in a hurry, the umpire counts the two out and one of them is allowed on the next pitch as a base hit. Thus, when a base runner touches home plate, it counts as an infield hit and two base hits, including the one out in which he has been forced to stay.\nOutput: 4\n\nInput: A student had written a paper talking about the value of a college education, and her mother encouraged her to take college courses and go into school instead of staying home and watching TV and playing video games.

The state of California is at war with its most populous state. As the conflict reaches its climax, President Reagan\u2019s government orders its air arm to invade Mexico. The air force does exactly what its commanding general tells it. When the plane is dropped on a small town, no other inhabitants are killed.  That morning, the townspeople hear about the airlift from the local radio station.  The air force officers who escaped death describe the event as the greatest airlift ever conducted by the United States.  In less than an hour, the townspeople get into cars to try and find out if the airlift was true.  They are forced to take a long trip in the desert.  On the second day, the desert wind forces the cars to veer off highways.  The cars eventually lose the ability to make turns, and most of the townspeople perish.  The next day, the president addresses the crisis in California as follows:\n\u201cCalifornia and Mexico are not enemies; we have much in common.  But under these circumstances, no other policy of military aggression can long be acceptable to the people of California and indeed to our country.  So let us resolve the differences between us now.  Let us reach across our differences; if we do so, we will not be judged by our differences of opinion but by what we accomplish together.  That is how we shall be judged by history and our children\u2019s children.\u201d\n\nInput:   To play Monopoly Board game, every player must start on their own property that they own.

{"text": "B)\n\nInput: Joe is out working on a ranch.  Joe is a rancher that raises cows for feed.  He had just loaded the cows onto an old tractor when he heard a loud noise.  When people hear loud noises that go above 80 decibels, they usually think it\u2019s the wind.  Joe walked over to the tractor so that he could check the oil and replace the clutch.  He looked at the oil, but it didn\u2019t look any different than it usually did.  Then he went over to the tractor and did some inspection of its parts, and didn\u2019t find anything wrong.  He didn\u2019t check the clutch, but did take a look at the oil.  He was shocked to see that it was totally dry.  He went into the barn and grabbed some oil and started filling up the oil tank to refill the oil, and also filled up the transmission.  Soon after this, the tractor started and ran great!  Joe ran the old tractor for a half mile.  While he was driving it, he discovered that the transmission was not working properly!  He noticed the transmission light was blinking and the transmission was making a strange noise when he tried to start it.  He ran the transmission a few more times.  Then his transmission started making a very peculiar noise when he tried to go up and down hills.  It also seemed like it was in trouble.  While he tried to work the transmission this way and that, it had to be constantly adjusted to keep from slipping or breaking down.  After a few tries, he finally decided that the transmission could not hold up against the weight of the cattle and the farm equipment he was hauling around the ranch.  He figured that if the transmission was not going to last forever, he had better get it over with.  So he got the tractor down to the barn.  Then he started on the back of the old tractor.  Once he got into the tractor, he started shifting the gears and revving things up to try and get the transmission to start.  He tried it all, for about half an hour, when he discovered that there was no oil in the transmission, which meant there was no way the transmission was going to work anymore.  After some coaxing, he was able to get it to start.  He went back to the barn and he pulled some empty milk jugs from the refrigerator.  He started bringing the jugs down the hill.", "answer": "D: mouth"}

This worksheet gives you a list of possible data set. Then you have to determine what to do with the data. We have seen the data sets before and now you are required to solve a problem using the data sets. Remember, this worksheet is meant for middle and high school math students, ages 11-14.<n><n>The data is divided into two groups by the first column that corresponds to the age of the data. Then the data is divided into two additional group by their weight. After that, what you take from each group and compare it to the other. Then you take the overall average and divide it by the number of cards in the deck. You get your weight. The other data that you use is the percent of kids that were in the group at the time the data was split. Lastly, you add both averages together and divide to get a final result. The final result is also divided into two groups with each group being age-wise. Then you take the group average and divide by five. Lastly, you add all the group averages together. You end up with five groups. Then you add all the groups together and divide into two groups: 1 and 2. Then you take percent of kids in groups #1 and #2 and compare them to the ones from groups #1 and #3. Finally, you add the percent of kids in groups 1 and 2 and compare to those in #1 and #2. Your answers will be the same as your previous questions, but the way you add things up to get your final answer will be different.<n><n>If you have seen past questions, you will see that this worksheet has all the columns and rows of data.

Therefore, John got out of the car and began walking towards the airplane to try to get it to land so that he could ask it about its fuel consumption.  John saw that the bird was already coming down the hill and he ran to his window.  The bird only stopped when it saw the car and began to fly downhill.  The bird stopped about 30 feet and began its descent again.  John chased the bird for a couple of miles before it got on Interstate 95.  When they crossed the median, the airplane made a turn towards the exit.  The airplane taxied to a nearby truck stop, filled up several gas tanks, and left.  John called his wife to warn her that they might soon be in trouble.  His wife called 911 and told the operator that the aircraft had taken off.  The tower operator then informed John's daughter, Lisa, of what had just happened and instructed her to run for the door of her house.  Within about a minute, the plane returned to the pavement and taxied to a parking lot.  From there, the airplane was driven to a storage facility.  Lisa made the trip from Chicago to New York in just about five hours, including two and a half hours for the plane ride.   Because of the airplane’s fuel capacity, authorities were unable to determine how much fuel was left in the airplane after the crash.<n>Output: 40<n>*Note: *Some information provided is based on the real-life experience of a student at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

(There is an alternative to "the ladder of power."  "The ladder of responsibility" is better because it is more accurate.)  1. If a problem occurs at the root (management), then all the workers who work below may be unable to solve the problem and may require that higher management be called to assist.  2. When a higher level of management is involved, all of the workers may experience a decrease in their pay and opportunities.  3. When higher level of management is called in to solve a problem, several workers become affected by the solution and may require compensation. 4. When a solution is achieved, and all of the workers may receive compensation for the cost of labor, a new problem may erupt. 5. When the workers are rewarded when a solution is achieved, they may not work to exceed the level of reward, and in fact may even attempt to limit their level of experience in order to avoid rewards that are too high.  6. When a lower level of management is involved in a problem, the workers may feel that the solution gives them a superior level of status and will encourage them to continue performing with poor effort and poor results.<n>Output: 6<n><n>Input: What are the advantages of the government program? 1.

He’ll plant five rows of corn at different locations around the field, and then he will plant two rows of corn at other locations on the same row.  He’d like to have enough corn at each location to harvest at least one bushel of corn that would sell for $4.50 per bushel.  So the farmer wants to plant at least two different locations of corn.  The first location that he plants, is the location where he plants the third row of corn, but he only plants one bushel at each location.  The farmer thinks that he may get two bushels for each of his planted locations, but each location only yields one bushel for each bushel of corn.  So the farmer plans to plant only at least two locations of corn.  Then to ensure that he harvests more than one bushel per row of corn, he’ll plant at least three locations where he plants the first row.  If at least one bushel per row lands in each location of corn, he gets at least 9 bushels per row.  If at most 2 bushels land in each location of corn in that row, then he gets only 4 bushels per row, and therefore doesn’t get enough corn to produce $4.50 per row that sells for $4.50.  What are the values of each of the locations where he plants corn?<n>Output: 4 x (9 + 2) / 4 = 16<n><n>Input: John can’t find the root of any of his potatoes in his garden.

However, the cost of a house is much higher: $50,000 per house. How many houses would Joseph need if he wanted to buy one house (or 100)?<n>Output: 100<n><n>Input: The annual mortgage payment on a house is $50,000.  It costs $15,000 to have new windows installed; a new roof and $10,000 to have new siding installed.  If each window and roof were built and installed at a $10,000 cost per window, each house would cost $2,000.  If each new house was a million-dollar house with 12 bedrooms, all of them would cost $8,000 each.  If each house cost each family $800 to $1,200 per month (to be paid over a month), the family would need $900,000 to $1,200,000 per month to pay the mortgage on the house.  How many months would that take the family?  10 months at $800 each month to save that amount, or 100 – 200 – 300 months between $800 per month and $20,000 per month.  In that case, how many new homes would Joseph need to build or remodel, or would the family use the home they already had (or built)?  How many new homes would Joseph build or remodel if they wanted 12, 15, or 20 bedrooms?  How much would they rent instead?  If they went to a 3 bedroom house with a 4 car garage and rented out 2 bedrooms to make the 3rd bedroom a study (for a total cost of $1,000 per month), Joe and Mary would need to buy a house worth $700,000.  At that price the mortgage wouldn’t be needed.  Could they pay it all with money from their savings?  Then that would make 3 housing projects: two for their income, and one for the mortgage.  How many would that save?  Two houses?

The answer is: B. You will need a college degree to work in your family business.   If you want to work in your family’s business for less than 4 years, it would be best to drop out.  But, college is expensive.  You’d probably earn more money if you dropped out after two years.  Then, you’d be able to go to college for a few years before you made your career choice.   What does the family business do? It makes clothes.  What does the family do about sales? The owner does her best to make her clothes look good.  How much does she make? The store makes 30 million dollars a year.  So, she earns 25 million on sales of 100 million.   What happens if sales go down? Then, it would be wise for her to work in the same family business for a few more years before she’s ready to leave.  What if the family business stops making clothes? Then, it might be best for her to move on.  But, she would continue to earn extra money.  Then, when she’s ready, she can find the family business that makes the best clothes.  What does she need to do before she can do that? She needs to find the best shopkeeper.  Then, she needs to become an expert in buying and selling fabrics.  What about the shopkeeper? He must do his best to sell the best clothes at the price his customers can afford.  What about the customer? His job is to buy the best clothes at the best prices.  What if he buys clothes at the wrong price? Then, he’s going to lose out on any money he might have made.  What about the competition? The other shopkeepers in town are all cutting down their prices. So, now the shop he works for is also lowering its prices.  What happens next?  The other shopkeepers will all compete for the business of buying from the shopkeeper. Then, the prices will go up.  Eventually, the competition will drive the prices ever lower in town.   When will the competition stop cutting down on the prices? When the shopkeeper stops cutting down his prices.   Then, what happens next is that the best customer buys whatever it is that the

The father sets up a loan that will last 70 years.  Every month of the loan period, the son is expected to make a $15 payment to pay off his loan.  If the son is to make that payment, at 10 years of age, there will be 1 year left to pay off the loan.  Assuming $100/year and a $50 loan amount, the final payment will be $1,800 in 1971.  Assuming an interest rate of 8% per year, the interest rate on the loan will be $17,000 in 1970 when the son is 38 years old and when the son is 77 years old, the interest rate will be $15,000.  Assuming an annual interest rate of 2% per year, the cost of paying off the loan will be $5.25 in 1971 and $4.75 in 1979.  If an interest rate of 10% per year is assumed at $3,000, the cost of paying the loan will be $3,000 in 1972 and $2,600 in 1979.  Suppose all the interest is included in the loan amount by calculating at a 7% annual rate.  The son will pay $7,375, and even if he has 5% more income than in 1970, the cost will be the same.  There will be a total of $18,000 in payments that will cause the loan to have a net present value of $15,000.<n>Output: $500<n><n>Input: Mary Ellen lives in a small house on the farm.

On the other hand, if a base runner steps on third (including himself), he can be considered safe for home and one out will be counted. Thus, the following are the rules of double plays:  When a man touches home plate, he is forced to stay on the bag and any player on that side has to call out home to the base runner, and anyone running past the out-runner does not have to call this out. Then, once the runner on home plate completes the tag, he is safe for home and one batter will be out. Thus, the following set of rules are the definition of an infield hit when a base runner does not attempt to steal :  A base runner does not have an instant chance to steal second or third if he does not want to;  If he tries to steal second or third immediately after touching home plate, an umpire makes him stay on the bag until he finishes the tag  If he tries to go for third in a hurry, the umpire counts the two out and one of them is allowed on the next pitch as a base hit. Thus, when a base runner touches home plate, it counts as an infield hit and two base hits, including the one out in which he has been forced to stay.<n>Output: 4<n><n>Input: A student had written a paper talking about the value of a college education, and her mother encouraged her to take college courses and go into school instead of staying home and watching TV and playing video games.

The second woman comes on right when he finishes counting and the third one is right there as he begins counting seconds.

The state of California is at war with its most populous state. As the conflict reaches its climax, President Reagan’s government orders its air arm to invade Mexico. The air force does exactly what its commanding general tells it. When the plane is dropped on a small town, no other inhabitants are killed.  That morning, the townspeople hear about the airlift from the local radio station.  The air force officers who escaped death describe the event as the greatest airlift ever conducted by the United States.  In less than an hour, the townspeople get into cars to try and find out if the airlift was true.  They are forced to take a long trip in the desert.  On the second day, the desert wind forces the cars to veer off highways.  The cars eventually lose the ability to make turns, and most of the townspeople perish.  The next day, the president addresses the crisis in California as follows:<n>“California and Mexico are not enemies; we have much in common.  But under these circumstances, no other policy of military aggression can long be acceptable to the people of California and indeed to our country.  So let us resolve the differences between us now.  Let us reach across our differences; if we do so, we will not be judged by our differences of opinion but by what we accomplish together.  That is how we shall be judged by history and our children’s children.”<n><n>Input:   To play Monopoly Board game, every player must start on their own property that they own.

Choices:  A: come home B: airplane C: learn from each other D: go out E: make art<n>Output:		 1<n><n>Answers:<n><n>A: Come home<n>B: make art<n>C: learn from each other<n>D: go out<n>E: make art<n><n>D: Go out<n><n>The question asked about the difference between the answers we get from D and E. E answers 1.  D uses "make art".  The other answers follow the question of which is correct.  D's answer is "make art", and the other two answers have to do with D leaving the group because of some problem.  The correct answer is to use "come home".  We should add A and C.<n>A: D’s right answer<n>B: D is incorrect on the question.<n><n>D’s correct answer:  Make art<n><n>Note:  “I”, “we”, “us”, and “me” here mean “you”. We and us here mean “You” or “You and Me”.<n><n>Answer:  1<n><n>D: Come home<n><n>When we see D’s correct answer, we see two things: (1) he was in a group (with 2 other people; one of them was Kelly) that started to get into trouble. (2) One of the group said something derogatory to D. This is a negative group reaction and an A is to be given for this answer.<n><n>D”s correct answer is not just a question. He left the group.  We also see that the negative group reaction, that Kelly was talking about, also affected the question.  There were 9 people: A., D., E., J., M., S., S., W., and E.  I have not seen E. in these questions, but her answer is correct if it is correct on D’s right hand.  It makes sense for me to give a A-plus-two (A for D and a 2 for E.) if the answer is correct for me.

On the repair team, the first employee is a mechanic.  The mechanic fixes the car.  When the car is back in operation, the manager asks the mechanic to change a tire.  The mechanic puts the new tire on and drives off to the next job.  After a few minutes his car starts to smoke, so he reaches under the hood and discovers a large amount of black smoke.  He pulls the hood apart to investigate and realizes that two tires, both with bald spots on them, are smoking.  He walks to the other side of the car and discovers a hose attached to the brake pad.  He ties it to his truck and then begins to try to get his car started.  He can’t get the brakes to engage.  The mechanic is stuck.  The mechanic: 1. Pulls the lever to activate the emergency brake and 2. Squints while pressing the lever against the floor. After about 5 minutes of trying to start the car, he decides to cut the wire connecting the brake pads to the engine brake, releasing the pressure on the emergency brake. He gets the engine going again and stops the car.  When he is done, he unplugs the brake and gets out of the car to see if there is anything wrong, but suddenly he feels an electrical surge in his body and his head swamps with sweat.  He falls to the ground in disbelief.  He tries to take his cell phone out of his pocket to see if he is going to get a call, but he gets the signal blocked by his own sweat.  As he continues to stand and walk down the street, he can no longer see any of the pedestrians because of his own sweat and the black smoke.  He then realizes that in the back of his car is the smoke that exploded in his face and he falls facefirst to the ground.  What did the mechanic do next?  Answer the following multiple choice questions in the form supplied below:  • Who in the repair shop was a member of a first-aid squad? • What skills did the employees at the repair shop have? • What did the shop do when the mechanic was having trouble starting the car? • How did his co-workers react?<n>Output: 36<n><n>Input: A trucking company pays employees $20/day for driving and they receive a $250 bonus when they drive 200 miles between shifts.

Choices:  A: water B: doctor C: spread disease D: mouth E: ear<n>Output:		 B)<n><n>Input: Joe is out working on a ranch.  Joe is a rancher that raises cows for feed.  He had just loaded the cows onto an old tractor when he heard a loud noise.  When people hear loud noises that go above 80 decibels, they usually think it’s the wind.  Joe walked over to the tractor so that he could check the oil and replace the clutch.  He looked at the oil, but it didn’t look any different than it usually did.  Then he went over to the tractor and did some inspection of its parts, and didn’t find anything wrong.  He didn’t check the clutch, but did take a look at the oil.  He was shocked to see that it was totally dry.  He went into the barn and grabbed some oil and started filling up the oil tank to refill the oil, and also filled up the transmission.  Soon after this, the tractor started and ran great!  Joe ran the old tractor for a half mile.  While he was driving it, he discovered that the transmission was not working properly!  He noticed the transmission light was blinking and the transmission was making a strange noise when he tried to start it.  He ran the transmission a few more times.  Then his transmission started making a very peculiar noise when he tried to go up and down hills.  It also seemed like it was in trouble.  While he tried to work the transmission this way and that, it had to be constantly adjusted to keep from slipping or breaking down.  After a few tries, he finally decided that the transmission could not hold up against the weight of the cattle and the farm equipment he was hauling around the ranch.  He figured that if the transmission was not going to last forever, he had better get it over with.  So he got the tractor down to the barn.  Then he started on the back of the old tractor.  Once he got into the tractor, he started shifting the gears and revving things up to try and get the transmission to start.  He tried it all, for about half an hour, when he discovered that there was no oil in the transmission, which meant there was no way the transmission was going to work anymore.  After some coaxing, he was able to get it to start.  He went back to the barn and he pulled some empty milk jugs from the refrigerator.  He started bringing the jugs down the hill.

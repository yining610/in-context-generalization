{"text": "Input: In which of James' books is there a section about what happens if there are too many people working at the same location? (A)\nOutput:\n\nThe three types of calculations may seem trivial, but they reveal some common weaknesses of common programming practices.\nSome popular programming mistakes involve assigning an \"opaque value\" to a variable. For some programming languages, opaque variables are particularly dangerous. Consider the C programming language:\n\nThe obvious problem with such a variable is that it is difficult to read or maintain by others; furthermore, any other programming language can do away with such a language variable. The second issue is that variables are sometimes difficult to change without modifying the code, and modifying the code can break (or prevent) some types of programming programs.\nAs I will show in the next section, however, opaque variables can cause problems for ordinary programming programs:\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n\nThe three types also cause problems when programming in C++:\n\n1. The use of an opaque variable has no known implementation; rather, the code above could work well in any C++ implementation, even one very different from the one used in the code.\n2. When using an opaque variable, it does not follow that its value is a constant:\n\nThe use of an opaque variable is an error when changing a variable or even when modifying that variable.\n\nMost other common programming mistakes are similar:\n\n1. Using an opaque variable that does in fact have an implementation. I will show how this problem could be avoided, but first I would like to show another error, an error that arises after using an opaque variable. I shall call this error the type-inference problem.\n\n2. Using an opaque constant. The use of an\nopen_variable()()\nconstant would be OK in a compiled language, but it will not be OK in an \"embedded\" language that compiles to bytecode.\n\n3. Using an opaque constant that does not have an implementation. It is OK to use an opaque constant that does have an implementation, because if you change any field of the constant, you are actually modifying the type of the constant.\n\n4.

The answer would be that a Democrat cannot be elected to be president in any case whether he is in an electoral college or not.

You can eat 40 grams of protein in the span of a full 12-hour workday.  For one egg, you would need 6 slices of bacon as the slices are only 4 ounces apiece and the bacon is 2 ounces. A full size egg would therefore require 12 slices and you would need 48 oz. of bacon to fill your 24 oz. appetite. A hotdog on the other hand requires no bacon and therefore you only need a single slice of cheese to have the required calories to sustain your day. In the span of a full day, a full size egg would require a full 24 oz. of cheese. In addition to these figures, consider the following table which compares the estimated energy consumption and caloric intake for the following foods compared to egg.\nOutput: 1,200 (5% energy)\ninput: 24 oz (4% energy)\nOutput: 750 (51% energy)\n\nInput: How many hours per week do you spend in an office?

It says that they worked 4 hours and then they joined by 6 other people - not four people working at the same rate as them - and so the work took 6 hours total even though the 4 people did all their actual work by the end of the day.  The other 6 spent more time waiting for the other 6 that actually did the work.  The 4 people who left with the 6 spent nearly all their time outside of work doing something they may not have been interested in or even able to get done in a full day's time.  As a result, all the 6 people spent more time waiting for them than actually working.\n\nNote the order of operations in the problem.

If each student reports in on time each week, the class averages 0.7 failures on the tests. If each student reports on time approximately 50% of the students report on time.  The class average success rate is 0.85.\n\n A student, Jane, will come to the teacher's office each day with a test question.  Jane will not need help if her teachers can quickly make a connection between each problem.  If Jane's teachers don't know what type of questions the students are going to ask, she will need some extra help.  The average amount of time needed for Jane to get help will be the time it takes for that teacher to give some individual help, as well as the time it takes for each teacher to finish the test for Jane.  This will be approximately 5 hours.  Jack will use one method to get help for Jane every day.  Jack will be giving 3 test tips per day to students taking their test.  He will then ask the student to go home and do the practice test on his or her own.  Jack's tips will be about 1-2 minutes each tip.  This will take 1-2 minutes per day.  Jack will then use the remaining time to go over the test with his students.  Jack will only be discussing solutions for up to 5 minutes per problem.  Then he will help a student look up the answer on the internet.  All of this can take 15 minutes at a time per student.  This will not take 1 hour per day; it will take 15 minutes on average.

The two oldest boys and their younger brother were playing in this sand and they enjoyed it immensely. The second oldest boy said to the younger brother, \"I wonder where these stones are from?\"  The younger brother replied, \"From far away.\" How much did the sand weigh?\nOutput: 757 tons\n** This equation is meant to be a bit more complicated than stated, in that there is nothing stated about the weight of the sand, and also because the two boys do in fact have a younger brother who played in the sand.  So yes, the sand did weigh 757 tons, and so one could argue that the sand was from far away, but that does not detract from the fact that the sand is as real as it can get.\n* This particular problem is one that would appear to violate several of the elementary rules of probability. In the event of more than two students participating, this equation may be written as\noutput = 757 x 2.7\n** Note: If this equation does not specify how many students do in fact participate, then the answer stated does not work, however, it does mean in the actual math it works as follows:\noutput = 757 * 2.7\n\nInput: The following list consists of a list of 5 names, 5 objects and 5 other items.

At this point another passenger passed on, saying that he had heard the news on TV. Adam said he was very sad. The manager said that this was the last cruise of this season, and they had many reservations in November and December and were disappointed. Adam said that he did not know what to say to help. The manager said he did not think anyone could make him feel better. The manager asked him if he needed to sit in another cabin while the others on board made him a new cruise itinerary.

During the past year, the farmer lost $12,000 in the market.  When the farmer goes to sell his calves, he gets a new contract to supply two herds owned by the same dairy at a lower price.  If the farmer sold his calves to the new dairy for $8 per head in 2011, and the total price of selling the calves was $13 per head in 2012, the total cost of the farmer's 2012 cattle sales was $13,200.  If Adam sold his calves to the same dairy without changing a price, the total cost of selling his 2010 cattle would be the same as the cost of selling his 2012 cattle.  To estimate the price of selling the 2010 cattle in 2010, calculate the difference between the price in 2010 and the price in 2011.  To figure out the price of selling the 2012 cattle, calculate the difference between $13 in 2012 and $10 in 2010.  To calculate 2011 prices, add back 2011's $12k and $14k to $13k.  Then add back 2010's $12k and 2011's $13k.  That brings his total income to $16,200.  Assuming that his 2008 income is zero, Adam would earn $2k per year more in 2012. That would take him to a total income of $22k, or more than $800 higher than his 2008 total, even though the entire income increase is due to gains from selling the 2010 cattle.\nOutput: $10,841 (+ $2,000)\n\nInput: Tom and Jane have bought a car to replace one that broke down.

If we multiply the total number of trees at the turn of the century, we get something like 100 billion trees planted over the next 50 years or so.  If we multiply the trees planted by the population of the nation, we get something like a billion trees per nation. In other words, the tree planting rate was about 200 billion trees planted per year in the twentieth century.  The tree planting rate grew strongly as population increased in the twentieth century, and will likely grow even further.  This trend is a strong factor affecting the climate and will significantly affect the rate of climate change.  Globalization is driving this trend.  This is part of the global warming problem.\nOutput: 120 billion\n\nIn the United States, some people think that the federal income tax is too high.

{"text": "4\nAnswer: E\nExplanation:\n\nSOCIAL EDUCATION\n\nInput: The year 2003 is a leap year.  Many businesses want a large number of people to go back to work with them.  Thus, many businesses offer a pay increase of up to 30% that is given at this date.  Many people are happy for the raise but others are less enthusiastic.  One person is very concerned that most people may choose not to go back to work.  They are concerned that many people may feel that the raise is unfair.  They work hard at their jobs and this raises their pride and gives them an ego boost. They want to prove themselves and others wrong.  Others who are unhappy because they cannot choose to work for them, feel like they have been robbed of their pride and self-esteem.  To overcome the negative feelings of people who might not want to work, the people in charge of the firm pay $60,000 to one person who goes back to work and then tells everyone that he is back.  This is the pay increase and it brings the salary back to levels that were previously accepted.  Even though the amount of the pay increase is large, they consider it fair.  If people were forced to choose to work for them instead of going back to work for $60,000, many people would still do so.\nInput: The year 2011 is a leap year.

Or would they have asked for more money?  Would these 150 people have taken the job even though others did not?  If you had offered to give employees $15,000 over a period of three years, what would be the percentage of people you would recruit?  Assume that 60 people (50% of the people who applied) are recruited.  How many new employees would you have?  Assume that you were offering each of them $15,000 over three years.

Do not pick a route that will take you to the gym or your friends' homes. Instead select a route that has an average speed of 8-10 miles per hour. If they are running or walking to the gym, it is fine to follow them.  If they are running or running home, they should not get too close.  If you are running, you may be too close, but you are not allowed to pass them or they cannot pass you.  You are also not allowed to talk to them, or to get a feel a for their pace because of the risk of being passed and, in many instances, being slowed down. In any circumstance, do not try to catch up because they may be the only one out there who is doing a reasonable pace. Make sure that you are not too tired to run at the end of your run or you may be passed. Most people do not run the entire distance of their run and the majority of their time is spent walking.  If you have to get up in the middle of your workout to go to the bathroom, keep going. Keep in mind that you will not get a full two miles by walking or just running.

If you are a student you should give as many examples of questions as is possible and then add your own experience and thoughts on them.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s start off by looking at a situation with alcohol related spending from the real world. It was not long ago that it was common to go out drinking with friends on a Friday night without worrying about spending much money, but the days of going out and spending hundreds or thousands of dollars without worrying are gone. More and more people are finding it more efficient to buy their alcohol online, or get it drunk at home if it is a weekend night out. If you are someone who doesn\u2019t want to buy alcohol from the Internet then you will need to spend more than an average person.\n\nBy going the route of buying alcohol at home you will need to start to be more economical with your spending, and even if you get drunk at home it is likely that you will have to be more responsible with your drinking than in the past. Even if you just look at the numbers then you can see how important alcohol is to your lifestyle, and in addition to that alcohol really does not fit in with a healthy and balanced lifestyle \u2013 just look at the obesity epidemic that we have in this country.

They were not happy with the plans but the guy promised them they would be happy with the original plans.  The couple called a second guy who had done much of a water project for another client and the couple was even more unhappy.  They decided to call a third guy, with a company that could make better plans.  The couple began to change their plans.  They thought they were going to get the house they wanted but this third guy, who they had heard so much for, told them he had built a similar house where the water did not flow.  The couple decided they would have to start over and called the first guy again.  This guy took a look at their plans and realized how badly they need to change the plan.  He told them they need to start over, cut out a couple of layers of drywall and get back to building a house.  The couple got back to building and soon realized that what they had learned from the first guy would work.  They cut out a hole and brought the water to the basement.  They were shocked.  They realized that before they could get the water flowing the wet sand must be moved to hold the drywall.  Now they could not get the water flowing until the sand got a little warmer.  They could hold their breath just under the surface.  They kept holding their breaths as they took a look down.  They saw a little fish swimming around just beneath the surface of the water.  They were sure it was a dolphin or a whale.  However they knew that it was a fish and could not see any fins.  The fish was too big to be a dolphin and the fin looked like a whale head.

At the same time, you can become very knowledgeable if you choose to.  I\u2019ve spoken to many doctors and can tell you: Why they do what they do, what motivates them. You may be able to find out why they choose their practice if you dig deep enough.  Be a little more specific about your question and you may learn something.  There\u2019s no reason doctors are paid millions.  They are the last professionals on the planet.  If they are not doing it for the money, then perhaps the best pay would be to do a job someone else is doing FOR them.\nOutput: 7\n\nInput:The best part about being a doctor is the people. You get to help improve human lives.  You are given the chance to choose what life would look like for someone.  Your choice has to do with their ability to be as good or better than your experience could be.  It has nothing to do with whether you can see inside their brain and do surgery. They chose you, they trusted you and you went in to get to know them.  What is that about?  You can make a life for yourself.  You can choose what your work environment is.  You can choose your pay (if you work elsewhere).  You can choose your work schedule.  You can choose whether you want to be in a cubicle or a office or a room, or in a nursing home or in the emergency room, or you can choose to be a doctor or a lawyer, a nurse, a therapist, a paramedic, a dentist, a salesperson, an architect, a writer.  It\u2019s in your power to make a life that is better than the life most of us are living and it doesn\u2019t always feel like that, but if you work for a good doctor, the only question is: Why did you choose a profession where you are given the opportunity to change life?

In order to carry this backpack, hiking boots, water, etc., Tom will walk 5 hours a day at a pace that is roughly equivalent to the average adult male walking 5 hours a day.  Let's pretend that 20% of Tom's total daily average walking time from his home to the top of the mountain is the same as it is for an average person.  Now let's add in the weight of his backpack when Tom is in the mountains.  Using this equation, Tom will then need to walk 7 hours a day to travel from his starting point in the middle of the woods to where he wants to hike the entire trail.  (Suppose that 5\u2032 is his vertical height in the woods, and that his total weight each day is 1.5 times his average weight.)  Now it is obvious that Tom will need an additional 11 or 12 hours per day in order to meet his goal of hiking the whole trail.

A, B, C and D correspond to the full moon, minimum moon, full moon and a new moon respectively.\nOutput: -2\n\ninput/output questions for english class\n\nA: The sun and moon are facing the same plane both at noon. The sun is closer to the Earth during summer and has a higher gravitational field. The moon is farther away and has a lower gravitational field.\nOutput: +2\n\nB: The sun and the moon face away from each other as they rotate their orbits around Earth one day at a time. The sun is close to the Earth during summer when it has a higher gravitational field, while the moon is farther away and therefore has a lower gravitational field of about \u22123.5.\nOutput: -3\n\nC: Each moon is made up of 60% of the sun's mass, resulting in a larger body relative to the Earth's orbit. As the moon orbits the Earth, it draws closer to the Earth each day. Because it does not have to deal with the sun's gravity it orbits farther away. This creates a different gravitational field for each day, resulting in differing rotational velocities for any given day. If each day of a moon's orbit is represented by the same velocity it would appear to travel at the same speed of 2.0 mph in a day but would actually be moving at 7.0 mph, or a speed of over 400% faster.\nOutput: +3\n\nD: The moon's orbit is closer to the Earth than the sun's. As the moon continues to orbit the Earth, its angular orientation relative to the Earth's axis changes as the moon reaches its apogee and perigee. Consequently, the moon's rotation remains the same but the relative direction of its orbital motion varies. If the moon were to remain in one position relative to the Earth, at one particular location on the face of the Earth, it would appear to move at the speed of 2.0 m/sec. But instead, it would move around the Earth in many planes, with each plane having its own velocity. Therefore, it would appear to be traveling at a speed of 7.0 m/sec instead of the original 2.0 m/Sec due to the difference in the velocity of each plane.\nOutput: +1\n\nE: When you place one dollar in a slot", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

The eye is about the size of a football, but it contains 6 million cells and each cell can hold over 10 000 photos. At peak illumination the eye can see about 3 000 light bulbs. To maintain a constant depth perception for a person with an ocular disease the eye must be able to reflect more light than it absorbs, the more light reflected back the better the vision. This is known as dark vision syndrome. If the eye had no reflective surface it would be less efficient, which would mean that photosynthetic organisms produce more light. In order to compensate for the darkness generated by cloudy conditions the eye of the person with a condition would have to produce about twice as much energy as a normal human with no condition would. This is known as the photodetector. The eye's photodetectors are very efficient in the glare of the sun, and the light they collect is sent to the brain via a complex circuit of pathways. The signals received from the photodetectors then convert to electrical signals which are transmitted by the eye's optic nerve to the brain as inputs. It is the job of the brain to translate the signals received from the eyes muscles, which send stimuli to the brain as inputs, to information needed for visual vision. A person who has dark vision syndrome is visually impaired, but they maintain the ability to carry out normal everyday activities.\nOutput: 12\n\nInput:If you know how many hours the human eye can \"see a day\", give the human eye time to complete one complete cycle of light and dark.

For the same trip in an MPV of Alice's size with 3 adults and 3 children, in the same time John's trip will be 30 minutes plus gas, $100.  Alice would save $60.  Alice's trip would save 40 minutes and the MPV's trip would save 60 minutes.  Alice's family trip and a family trip with her parents would be more expensive than John's family trip alone.  Alice and her family's trip each save 40 minutes, but Alice adds the extra time spent in her MPV's car since it is twice as far to the store as it is in her SUV.  Alice's trip saves 60 minutes, but her MPV trips adds about 30 minutes to the trip.  The sum of the savings from the MPV trips is $150.00.  Therefore, her trip to the store is more time consuming than her trip alone.  Because of the additional costs for the MPV trips, she will be happier with her trip alone.  Therefore, Alice should get her SUV while they still have it.  Alice and her husband should take turns driving the SUV to avoid paying extra for the fuel it takes to travel in an MPG more efficient vehicle.  She should try a small MPV in order to find a fuel price that she can stay with until her SUV falls apart.\n\nAnswers\n\n1) A - 3.2m 2) B - 6.7m 4) C - 8m 5) D - 8", "answer": "C: repair shop"}

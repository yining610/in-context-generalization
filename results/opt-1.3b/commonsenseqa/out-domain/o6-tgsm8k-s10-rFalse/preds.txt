(A)<n>Output:<n><n>The three types of calculations may seem trivial, but they reveal some common weaknesses of common programming practices.<n>Some popular programming mistakes involve assigning an "opaque value" to a variable. For some programming languages, opaque variables are particularly dangerous. Consider the C programming language:<n><n>The obvious problem with such a variable is that it is difficult to read or maintain by others; furthermore, any other programming language can do away with such a language variable. The second issue is that variables are sometimes difficult to change without modifying the code, and modifying the code can break (or prevent) some types of programming programs.<n>As I will show in the next section, however, opaque variables can cause problems for ordinary programming programs:<n><n>1.<n>2.<n>3.<n>4.<n>5.<n>6.<n>7.<n>8.<n>9.<n>10.<n>11.<n>12.<n>13.<n>14.<n>15.<n>16.<n><n>The three types also cause problems when programming in C++:<n><n>1. The use of an opaque variable has no known implementation; rather, the code above could work well in any C++ implementation, even one very different from the one used in the code.<n>2. When using an opaque variable, it does not follow that its value is a constant:<n><n>The use of an opaque variable is an error when changing a variable or even when modifying that variable.<n><n>Most other common programming mistakes are similar:<n><n>1. Using an opaque variable that does in fact have an implementation. I will show how this problem could be avoided, but first I would like to show another error, an error that arises after using an opaque variable. I shall call this error the type-inference problem.<n><n>2. Using an opaque constant. The use of an<n>open_variable()()<n>constant would be OK in a compiled language, but it will not be OK in an "embedded" language that compiles to bytecode.<n><n>3. Using an opaque constant that does not have an implementation. It is OK to use an opaque constant that does have an implementation, because if you change any field of the constant, you are actually modifying the type of the constant.<n><n>4. Using an opaque constant without modifying the type:<n><n>This is a

The first reason is that he is lazy, and it is time consuming for him and the contractors to find a surveyor to do the survey. The second reason is that it is not as expensive to hire a surveyor as it is to hire more workers.  If he hires too many people, the cost of running the construction company would increase, and there would not be enough profits to pay the workers so that he may hire contractors as well.

The answer would be that a Democrat cannot be elected to be president in any case whether he is in an electoral college or not. However, for a Democrat to be elected in a non-electoral way a Democrat needs to be the first minority president and to have a net support of 3 or more electoral votes in the state of his own election. If a Democrat has a net support of only one electoral vote, there is no chance of he being elected president.

You can eat 40 grams of protein in the span of a full 12-hour workday.  For one egg, you would need 6 slices of bacon as the slices are only 4 ounces apiece and the bacon is 2 ounces. A full size egg would therefore require 12 slices and you would need 48 oz. of bacon to fill your 24 oz. appetite. A hotdog on the other hand requires no bacon and therefore you only need a single slice of cheese to have the required calories to sustain your day. In the span of a full day, a full size egg would require a full 24 oz. of cheese.

The ball is hit to the center fielder and the center fielder throws directly at the ball. When the ball hits the outfield, the runner is out by a half-step from the runner-first first out. Now we have to work out the rest of the play.  If the ball hit the outfield, the runner would have been out by 2 steps from the runner first out. The runner would have been out on the runner second first out. Work out the rest of the game by adding up the outs that have been called to date.  Note the difference between the outs by the runner first first out. He would have reached the first base out when he threw the ball, and the runner would have needed to move on to the second base to avoid being out on the runner second last out, and the runner second last out would have remained out by 1 step after he threw the ball.<n>Output: 10<n>The same play with a fly ball to right would have been called out for a ground ball.

The other 6 spent more time waiting for the other 6 that actually did the work.  The 4 people who left with the 6 spent nearly all their time outside of work doing something they may not have been interested in or even able to get done in a full day's time.

Each student is to answer all questions on the tests.  Jack's class has a total of 606 students.  Approximately 300 will need to respond on the tests.  Let the class size be 100.  If each student reports in on time each week, the class averages 0.7 failures on the tests. If each student reports on time approximately 50% of the students report on time.  The class average success rate is 0.85.<n><n> A student, Jane, will come to the teacher's office each day with a test question.  Jane will not need help if her teachers can quickly make a connection between each problem.  If Jane's teachers don't know what type of questions the students are going to ask, she will need some extra help.  The average amount of time needed for Jane to get help will be the time it takes for that teacher to give some individual help, as well as the time it takes for each teacher to finish the test for Jane.  This will be approximately 5 hours.  Jack will use one method to get help for Jane every day.  Jack will be giving 3 test tips per day to students taking their test.  He will then ask the student to go home and do the practice test on his or her own.  Jack's tips will be about 1-2 minutes each tip.  This will take 1-2 minutes per day.  Jack will then use the remaining time to go over the test with his students.  Jack will only be discussing solutions for up to 5 minutes per problem.  Then he will help a student look up the answer on the internet.  All of this can take 15 minutes at a time per student.  This will not take 1 hour per day; it will take 15 minutes on average.  To account for some of these extra moments, Jack will have about 20 minutes of class time when students are sitting in class and about 15 minutes while they are working in the lab for about ten minutes every time you ask him how long the class took.<n>

The beach was covered with sand for nearly 40 miles around the whole area. The two oldest boys and their younger brother were playing in this sand and they enjoyed it immensely. The second oldest boy said to the younger brother, "I wonder where these stones are from?"  The younger brother replied, "From far away." How much did the sand weigh?<n>Output: 757 tons<n>** This equation is meant to be a bit more complicated than stated, in that there is nothing stated about the weight of the sand, and also because the two boys do in fact have a younger brother who played in the sand.  So yes, the sand did weigh 757 tons, and so one could argue that the sand was from far away, but that does not detract from the fact that the sand is as real as it can get.<n>* This particular problem is one that would appear to violate several of the elementary rules of probability. In the event of more than two students participating, this equation may be written as<n>output = 757 x 2.7<n>** Note: If this equation does not specify how many students do in fact participate, then the answer stated does not work, however, it does mean in the actual math it works as follows:<n>output = 757 * 2.7<n><n>Input: The following list consists of a list of 5 names, 5 objects and 5 other items.

In order to adjust for changes in lifespan caused by medical procedures, the calculation in the following table assumes a person has one child at age 25, dies before age 35, and has children during his life expectancy.  This table will give the average mortality for women and men in both countries.  It also assumes that the child is never married.  Thus, in each country, the average death rate of someone over age 18, married or divorced, will differ by a few percentage points. The corresponding statistics are given for South and North Korea, for Vietnam, and for the United States.  Both tables give a figure of 0.5 percent for the mortality rate of an aged 50 or older in this group in the United States. This method of calculating mortality rates can, however, be used with great accuracy if the child is never married and the death rate is close to that in South Korea and North Korea (Figure 14).

The bread box looks pretty large to him so he looks through it to see what is on offer. There are two kinds of bread, a piece of a white bread and a slice of a wheat-type of bread.

I told her that for me to be comfortable there has to be some effort from her to do something. For example, if she comes to talk to me in my living room just like I see her do when she’s walking by my computer and she expects me to respond to her with a meaningful gesture, then she is expecting more than I am willing to give to reciprocate her kindness. For her to be happy to give me that effort, all I have to do is ask her to go somewhere she thinks I deserve to be treated well, like a restaurant or a movie theater. But when we have a conversation in my kitchen or she is talking to me when I am in bed, I make the gesture that she gives me little love tokens, and that I expect this from her. And I find my self being hurt as if she has done nothing to deserve any of this. I then feel like a failure. I don't really recognize the emotional investment she is making in my relationship. It's making me feel as if I am not good enough and I am not contributing to the love in my relationship.

The manager walked forward to stop and talk to Adam. He asked what Adam was doing. Adam said he was on ship,  he had come from a cruise. The manager asked whether he had come on ship this past week and Adam said yes. Adam asked if the cruise was going to the Bahamas. The manager said that the Bahamas had been canceled. At this point another passenger passed on, saying that he had heard the news on TV. Adam said he was very sad. The manager said that this was the last cruise of this season, and they had many reservations in November and December and were disappointed. Adam said that he did not know what to say to help. The manager said he did not think anyone could make him feel better. The manager asked him if he needed to sit in another cabin while the others on board made him a new cruise itinerary. Adam said that would be a little more expensive. The manager said that he would not be able to make Adam feel any better. The manager told Adam to continue on to the restaurant with his friends and enjoy his trip. Then he turned to walk away and Adam began to thank the manager for his help. The manager's shoulder suddenly came up to contact Adam's leg. Adam grabbed the arm and pushed the manager back just as another cruise passenger walked up with his arm coming from between the manager's shoulder and Adam's leg. The manager again touched Adam's leg and this time he pushed him away from the arm. Adam said that was not necessary. The manager said that next time he wanted to touch his leg before he passed on the information. Then the passenger said he had a tip. Adam asked if they could get a room at the resort.

The manager said that there were no such rooms available for the group in the room block the group was on now. Adam said that he would like that as well, and that he would come back with a decision when they got to the resort. On that same trip Adam had also been given a bottle of beer so that he would have someone to come to the resort with. At this point two more passengers came aboard

He is late for work for the first time in 2 years.  If Adam had gone his scheduled time at the airport, he would have still left work on time.  To figure out how quickly he could leave his job, calculate the hourly wage he gets for being late.<n>Output: 3 hours<n><n>Input: A farmer sells one-month-old calves to a dairy company.  During the past year, the farmer lost $12,000 in the market.  When the farmer goes to sell his calves, he gets a new contract to supply two herds owned by the same dairy at a lower price.  If the farmer sold his calves to the new dairy for $8 per head in 2011, and the total price of selling the calves was $13 per head in 2012, the total cost of the farmer's 2012 cattle sales was $13,200.  If Adam sold his calves to the same dairy without changing a price, the total cost of selling his 2010 cattle would be the same as the cost of selling his 2012 cattle.  To estimate the price of selling the 2010 cattle in 2010, calculate the difference between the price in 2010 and the price in 2011.  To figure out the price of selling the 2012 cattle, calculate the difference between $13 in 2012 and $10 in 2010.  To calculate 2011 prices, add back 2011's $12k and $14k to $13k.  Then add back 2010's $12k and 2011's $13k.  That brings his total income to $16,200.  Assuming that his 2008 income is zero, Adam would earn $2k per year more in 2012. That would take him to a total income of $22k, or more than $800 higher than his 2008 total, even though the entire income increase is due to gains from selling the 2010 cattle.<n>Output: $10,841 (+ $2,000)<n><n>Input: Tom and Jane have bought a car to replace one that broke down.

If we multiply the total number of trees at the turn of the century, we get something like 100 billion trees planted over the next 50 years or so.  If we multiply the trees planted by the population of the nation, we get something like a billion trees per nation. In other words, the tree planting rate was about 200 billion trees planted per year in the twentieth century.  The tree planting rate grew strongly as population increased in the twentieth century, and will likely grow even further.  This trend is a strong factor affecting the climate and will significantly affect the rate of climate change.  Globalization is driving this trend.

Many businesses want a large number of people to go back to work with them.  Thus, many businesses offer a pay increase of up to 30% that is given at this date.  Many people are happy for the raise but others are less enthusiastic.  One person is very concerned that most people may choose not to go back to work.  They are concerned that many people may feel that the raise is unfair.  They work hard at their jobs and this raises their pride and gives them an ego boost. They want to prove themselves and others wrong.  Others who are unhappy because they cannot choose to work for them, feel like they have been robbed of their pride and self-esteem.  To overcome the negative feelings of people who might not want to work, the people in charge of the firm pay $60,000 to one person who goes back to work and then tells everyone that he is back.  This is the pay increase and it brings the salary back to levels that were previously accepted.  Even though the amount of the pay increase is large, they consider it fair.  If people were forced to choose to work for them instead of going back to work for $60,000, many people would still do so.<n>Input: The year 2011 is a leap year. Business groups want to recruit the best people to take part in a special project that is being launched.  They give $10 per year to each person who applies to participate in the project.

Or would they have asked for more money?  Would these 150 people have taken the job even though others did not?  If you had offered to give employees $15,000 over a period of three years, what would be the percentage of people you would recruit?  Assume that 60 people (50% of the people who applied) are recruited.  How many new employees would you have?  Assume that you were offering each of them $15,000 over three years.  Would each person say yes to the offer?  Assume again that you offered each of them the entire amount of your offer over three years.  What do you think would be the percentage

Do not pick a route that will take you to the gym or your friends' homes. Instead select a route that has an average speed of 8-10 miles per hour. If they are running or walking to the gym, it is fine to follow them.  If they are running or running home, they should not get too close.  If you are running, you may be too close, but you are not allowed to pass them or they cannot pass you.  You are also not allowed to talk to them, or to get a feel a for their pace because of the risk of being passed and, in many instances, being slowed down. In any circumstance, do not try to catch up because they may be the only one out there who is doing a reasonable pace. Make sure that you are not too tired to run at the end of your run or you may be passed. Most people do not run the entire distance of their run and the majority of their time is spent walking.  If you have to get up in the middle of your workout to go to the bathroom, keep going. Keep in mind that you will not get a full two miles by walking or just running.  On one of the runs I did, I was unable to catch up because a group of friends was running and walking up the same part of our neighborhood's hill and I could not get out of their way. I had a very difficult time catching up.  I walked the entire 2 miles and the only person I caught up to was one of friends. I feel that this particular route is extremely difficult for walkers and runners.<n>Output: 12<n>

They have decided the house must have a basement with a waterway under it.  They know how they are going to build the house so they begin to build the basement.  They are about half-way finished when they decide that they would rather finish their house.  They decide to call a guy from Chicago who works on water projects and tells them the plans and tells them to go ahead and finish their own house.  The couple does exactly as instructed.  They were not happy with the plans but the guy promised them they would be happy with the original plans.  The couple called a second guy who had done much of a water project for another client and the couple was even more unhappy.  They decided to call a third guy, with a company that could make better plans.  The couple began to change their plans.  They thought they were going to get the house they wanted but this third guy, who they had heard so much for, told them he had built a similar house where the water did not flow.  The couple decided they would have to start over and called the first guy again.  This guy took a look at their plans and realized how badly they need to change the plan.  He told them they need to start over, cut out a couple of layers of drywall and get back to building a house.  The couple got back to building and soon realized that what they had learned from the first guy would work.  They cut out a hole and brought the water to the basement.  They were shocked.  They realized that before they could get the water flowing the wet sand must be moved to hold the drywall.  Now they could not get the water flowing until the sand got a little warmer.  They could hold their breath just under the surface.  They kept holding their breaths as they took a look down.  They saw a little fish swimming around just beneath the surface of the water.  They were sure it was a dolphin or a whale.  However they knew that it was a fish and could not see any fins.  The fish was too big to be a dolphin and the fin looked like a whale head.  They had to have a conversation about the shape of the fish as they discussed it for a bit.  They said that it looked like a turtle and they felt it was right on the money with what they saw in nature.

The only thing that people don’t understand is WHY.  People are just not wired that way.  At the same time, you can become very knowledgeable if you choose to.  I’ve spoken to many doctors and can tell you: Why they do what they do, what motivates them. You may be able to find out why they choose their practice if you dig deep enough.  Be a little more specific about your question and you may learn something.  There’s no reason doctors are paid millions.  They are the last professionals on the planet.  If they are not doing it for the money, then perhaps the best pay would be to do a job someone else is doing FOR them.<n>Output: 7<n><n>Input:The best part about being a doctor is the people. You get to help improve human lives.  You are given the chance to choose what life would look like for someone.  Your choice has to do with their ability to be as good or better than your experience could be.  It has nothing to do with whether you can see inside their brain and do surgery. They chose you, they trusted you and you went in to get to know them.  What is that about?  You can make a life for yourself.  You can choose what your work environment is.  You can choose your pay (if you work elsewhere).  You can choose your work schedule.  You can choose whether you want to be in a cubicle or a office or a room, or in a nursing home or in the emergency room, or you can choose to be a doctor or a lawyer, a nurse, a therapist, a paramedic, a dentist, a salesperson, an architect, a writer.  It’s in your power to make a life that is better than the life most of us are living and it doesn’t always feel like that, but if you work for a good doctor, the only question is: Why did you choose a profession where you are given the opportunity to change life?  What is it about working for doctors you’d like to change?<n>Output: 1<n><n>Input: At the end of every hour, doctors are paid 20% of the average wage.

A guy with big breasts can carry on a small conversation.       The question was "In the past, whenever I have played with girls, I asked them to take their shirts off. Girls are a bit scared of big breasts, they have never said 'no' to boys. Recently they showed greater interest in my body. I used to think of my body as something to play with, but now I see it as a woman. I started to play with boys as more friends than with strangers.

Sometimes my boyfriend thinks I am more beautiful than myself but I say that it is just because he sees more of me at home. I do not worry about my future marriage as I am very happy with my boyfriend."

The correct answer was "never."  It has not been found if the wrong answer for question 3 in question (B) was correct.  For these reasons, this answer is correct and all questions (A to D) were correct.  The question for question B was answered:     "The question's answer could not be found for that person."

In order to carry this backpack, hiking boots, water, etc., Tom will walk 5 hours a day at a pace that is roughly equivalent to the average adult male walking 5 hours a day.  Let's pretend that 20% of Tom's total daily average walking time from his home to the top of the mountain is the same as it is for an average person.  Now let's add in the weight of his backpack when Tom is in the mountains.  Using this equation, Tom will then need to walk 7 hours a day to travel from his starting point in the middle of the woods to where he wants to hike the entire trail.  (Suppose that 5′ is his vertical height in the woods, and that his total weight each day is 1.5 times his average weight.)

A, B, C and D correspond to the full moon, minimum moon, full moon and a new moon respectively.<n>Output: -2<n><n>input/output questions for english class<n><n>A: The sun and moon are facing the same plane both at noon. The sun is closer to the Earth during summer and has a higher gravitational field. The moon is farther away and has a lower gravitational field.<n>Output: +2<n><n>B: The sun and the moon face away from each other as they rotate their orbits around Earth one day at a time. The sun is close to the Earth during summer when it has a higher gravitational field, while the moon is farther away and therefore has a lower gravitational field of about −3.5.<n>Output: -3<n><n>C: Each moon is made up of 60% of the sun's mass, resulting in a larger body relative to the Earth's orbit. As the moon orbits the Earth, it draws closer to the Earth each day. Because it does not have to deal with the sun's gravity it orbits farther away. This creates a different gravitational field for each day, resulting in differing rotational velocities for any given day. If each day of a moon's orbit is represented by the same velocity it would appear to travel at the same speed of 2.0 mph in a day but would actually be moving at 7.0 mph, or a speed of over 400% faster.<n>Output: +3<n><n>D: The moon's orbit is closer to the Earth than the sun's. As the moon continues to orbit the Earth, its angular orientation relative to the Earth's axis changes as the moon reaches its apogee and perigee. Consequently, the moon's rotation remains the same but the relative direction of its orbital motion varies. If the moon were to remain in one position relative to the Earth, at one particular location on the face of the Earth, it would appear to move at the speed of 2.0 m/sec. But instead, it would move around the Earth in many planes, with each plane having its own velocity. Therefore, it would appear to be traveling at a speed of 7.0 m/sec instead of the original 2.0 m/Sec due to the difference in the velocity of each plane.<n>Output: +1<n><n>E: When you place one dollar in a slot

The total bill comes to $10,000, which the first programmer works out.  He then calculates how many lines of coded language should be generated to accomplish the program's goals, which is an average of each project's total lines of code.  He writes down the total lines of code and how many times each piece of code should be checked, and then calculates how many bugs will be introduced into his system if each method is run repeatedly, and then he compiles his program on an average of 10 copies of the program before submitting it for testing.  He calculates the total number of lines of code for the final version and uses it to predict potential bugs in his system, and then compares the final figure to his average prediction for the program's lines of code.  If his system's average number of lines of code is higher than his average prediction, he will likely have more bugs than predicted

In the real world, the answer is that it is impossible to prevent one person from suffering for the sake of another. That being said, let’s apply this to life. What is your ideal?   To take the answer at face value, it seems like any objective reality is one where people suffer. To answer it from a different perspective, it seems like suffering happens only because of selfishness. If you asked “what would your ideal is life is”, you could imagine a world where people are perfect and have free will. So what is your ideal life?   In what world would people suffer only because of selfishness?   The answer, for the real world, is that it is impossible. People can suffer, because they are imperfect human beings. There might be a society where a person would be forced to suffer and die if he chose not to, but that’s a world in which no one really enjoys suffering. That’s a world you would not like to live in.<n><n>input<n><n>Output<n><n>{The numbers used in this question are the last digit is used as the answer instead of decimal. }

Their father promises to support them and teach them the ways of life in the new country.  The sisters are not sure, however, that they want to be in the city.  They want to stay in their house in the village.  They must decide for themselves whether they want to live in the city.  One sister feels that the city is exciting and will make her life interesting.  The other feels that she would prefer staying in her village to have her sisters living in the city.   The girls spend their time studying, talking to people and playing.  One day, a man tells the girls that he wants women to marry and raise children in the city.  The sisters think for a moment about this and then reject this idea saying that they don't want to live in a city, they want to live in their village.  The men continue to try and influence the sister.  They keep asking her to get ready for the big time and to meet all the men in town.  One night two men try to talk to the other and then demand that the other get the permission of the sister to marry for the night.  The sister refuses.  The two men keep trying until they get a very angry response from the one woman.  The other sister tries to get the permission of both women and one is not ready for the other’s decision at all.  The second woman finally says yes and the two sisters move to the city.  The first sister feels that it’s strange that men feel this way after all she wants to do is live in the village to make a nice family.  This first sister feels lonely and is very happy in the city.

The only reason that the two sisters would want to move to the city is for the men to make their own decisions, have fun and find happiness for themselves. The girls move into a comfortable apartment as they try to settle down and make a good life here with their sister.  It takes them over a year to get married and their parents do not approve of their decision.  The sister refuses to marry a man that he would just like to have a nice family with.  After this experience, the two sisters decide to move back to their village.  They do not know what the life of the city is

He chooses to start his workbench at level 6, the lowest possible level.  On his way back to his desk he sees a rock slide down a cliff of an abandoned mountain road.  He decides to walk his way to the drop-off by starting at level 7.  After he reaches the top of the mountain road he takes four turns at a steep incline running up a slope.  When he reaches the top he reaches level 7, which is still steep, but not nearly as steep as the climb up the mountain road.  He takes three steps backward at a time, making his way back toward his work bench. After four steps he reaches the edge of the cliff. He reaches the top of the cliff just in time to avoid another rock slide, but not before he loses the bucket. He now has to walk back to his work bench, which now is level 6.<n>Output: A: 26 > B: 32 > C > D > F. >G. > H A: 12 > B: 20 > C > D > A: 36 > B: 20 > D > A: 60 > B: 46 > C: 36 > D > F.<n>Output: G > H > A, F, & G > H<n>Output

Bob wrote the following story.<n>Input: The story Bob wrote is entitled "Skipping rocks near the dam."  There is an old bridge at the end of the valley that connects two valleys.  A skier falls into the middle of the canyon and is unable to swim out of the canyon before going under and eventually drowning.  When Bob was young, at night he and his brother would go with their dog to watch the skiers.  Every night they would run their dogs over the bridges near the side of the canyon.  As time went on, the bridges became worn down and were no longer safe; it had started to freeze over.  The skiers would not notice the falling dog, but Bob and his brother would.  Bob's mother was on a trip out of town and her car stopped at the bridge about 50 feet up.  The bridge began to slide down toward the canyon.  Bob grabbed her hand and pulled her onto the bridge.  The boat had just enough time to head over the bridge to the other side but was too small a boat to make the turn.  The water in the canyon was quite deep and would drown anyone in the boat.  While on the bridge, the skier watched one of the two boats that had passed the bridge.  They sailed up through the fog of the freezing canyon water and disappeared behind the far side of the canyon.<n>Output: 836<n><n>Input: Bob writes 3 stories per day, 2 every day at 9 AM and 1 at 11 AM. He uses a 2,000 word limit for these stories.  Bob finishes his stories between 1 and 3 PM and makes each one approximately 30k words long.  He does this work in 30 minute blocks to avoid editing.  He has a short break every night at 3:30 PM, at which time he drinks 12 oz of coffee and a 16 oz bag of instant breakfast. Afterward he finishes one of his stories until 6 PM.  At 10:15 PM Bob goes to a bar for a beer and two glasses of water.<n>Output: 1,037<n><n>Output: If you are born today, you will be the first person born since the 19th century.

He goes looking at a Lincoln Continental and it is immediately withdrawn because it has a manual transmission (that's not automatic). He then decides to go look at the Impala. When he is about to buy it, the impala is suddenly withdrawn from sale. Tom has just walked into a dealership where he sees Impala's for sale. He goes up to the sales rep in charge and says "Can you put me on the Lincoln impala?" The rep looks at Tom confused so Tom decides that he wants the Lincoln Lincoln. Tom then decides to go back up to the salesman in charge. He asks if the impala is still available. The salesman looks at Tom confused and says "yes" but gives Tom a list of cars that are available. Tom then finishes his decision to buy the Lincoln Lincoln. Tom can then go to a different department where they have Lincoln Impalas for sale. One Impala (that has a manual transmission) has 1 year of service. Tom then goes up to speak to another salesman. He asks for his car's year of service. The rep then points to one of the Impalas next to the service desk and says "This one year of service is a great deal!"

Tom then decides to return to the Lincoln impala. The salesman looks at him confused and says "I just told you that the Impala is sold out right now?"

Tom looks out the window and can clearly see the corn fields and the corn getting higher and higher in the sky.

Choices:  A: sit down B: make mistakes C: have sex D: reproduce E: excrete<n>Output:		 E<n><n>Input:The human eye consists of a central region which contains the retina, cornea and a clear lens. The eye is about the size of a football, but it contains 6 million cells and each cell can hold over 10 000 photos. At peak illumination the eye can see about 3 000 light bulbs. To maintain a constant depth perception for a person with an ocular disease the eye must be able to reflect more light than it absorbs, the more light reflected back the better the vision. This is known as dark vision syndrome. If the eye had no reflective surface it would be less efficient, which would mean that photosynthetic organisms produce more light. In order to compensate for the darkness generated by cloudy conditions the eye of the person with a condition would have to produce about twice as much energy as a normal human with no condition would. This is known as the photodetector. The eye's photodetectors are very efficient in the glare of the sun, and the light they collect is sent to the brain via a complex circuit of pathways. The signals received from the photodetectors then convert to electrical signals which are transmitted by the eye's optic nerve to the brain as inputs. It is the job of the brain to translate the signals received from the eyes muscles, which send stimuli to the brain as inputs, to information needed for visual vision. A person who has dark vision syndrome is visually impaired, but they maintain the ability to carry out normal everyday activities.<n>Output: 12<n><n>Input:If you know how many hours the human eye can "see a day", give the human eye time to complete one complete cycle of light and dark.

John owns an SUV with a 3-passenger capacity.  To get to the store that Alice needs it take John 20 minutes.  Taking 4 minutes and driving 15 minutes, the price per hour for a trip to the store will be $50.  For the same trip in an MPV of Alice's size with 3 adults and 3 children, in the same time John's trip will be 30 minutes plus gas, $100.  Alice would save $60.  Alice's trip would save 40 minutes and the MPV's trip would save 60 minutes.  Alice's family trip and a family trip with her parents would be more expensive than John's family trip alone.  Alice and her family's trip each save 40 minutes, but Alice adds the extra time spent in her MPV's car since it is twice as far to the store as it is in her SUV.  Alice's trip saves 60 minutes, but her MPV trips adds about 30 minutes to the trip.  The sum of the savings from the MPV trips is $150.00.  Therefore, her trip to the store is more time consuming than her trip alone.  Because of the additional costs for the MPV trips, she will be happier with her trip alone.  Therefore, Alice should get her SUV while they still have it.  Alice and her husband should take turns driving the SUV to avoid paying extra for the fuel it takes to travel in an MPG more efficient vehicle.  She should try a small MPV in order to find a fuel price that she can stay with until her SUV falls apart.<n><n>Answers<n><n>1) A - 3.2m 2) B - 6.7m 4) C - 8m 5) D - 8

This is equivalent to 1 * $12.50 = $3.50 per kilogram. How much should he pay for his product?\nOutput: On the other hand, buying 1 kg of cheese from the same store should be more expensive.  For example, buying 2 kg of cheese from the grocery store will be 10 * $12.50 x 1 = $24.50.  Buying 1 kg of cheese from a different grocery store will be 6 * $12.50 * 1 = $8.50. Buying 4 kg of cheese from a supermarket will cost John $24.50 x 1.5 = $40.00. This is a total of $48.50. He should therefore pay $48.50 + $48.50 = $60.25 for his product. In this case, his product is $60.25.\n\nInput:The cost of diesel fuel will increase by 5%. How much will it cost if you buy diesel today at the usual price of $2.75/l?\nOutput: The average diesel price should increase by $1.50.  If you buy diesel today, the cost of your car should be $2.71/l, or $1.50 more than on this day last year.\nThe increase in the average price of diesel is equivalent to 5 * $1.50 = $15.00.\nNow, in the future, when the diesel price is higher, it will cost the average American $16.17 per gallon of gasoline, or $2.69 more.  If you buy some diesel today when it is cheaper than on this day lastyear, the diesel price will increase.\nYou have therefore bought diesel more than twice at the normal price $2.75 /l this year.\nNow the diesel price is $2.75/d = $2.75/gal, or $1.00 more.\n\nInput: You have a pair of headphones that cost $50.

If James had to make his bed, it would take way too much time to do so at night so he had to get his own room.  He used to sleep in the bed with his best friend so he missed out on making his best friend's bed every night.  He misses making his best friend's beautiful bed.\nIf James had to make his own bed, it would take him much less time to make each night so he decided to get his own room\nSo it is the end of the week and James goes to bed first.  But James's bed does not stay exactly where it is.  It has moved up and down and in and out of the floor every night.

Explain a little why.\nOutput: 1.1*$2.50 = $2.50\nThus, if 1.1 eggs were the maximum payment, the maximum payment per month is $2.50.

According to the latest UN estimates, the world\u2019s population will reach 8 billion by the end of the twenty century.  There are 5 billion people today and will increase to 9 billion by the middle of the century.  This means that at least half will be living on the planet in 2050.  Who will the new people make up?  Which country will be most at risk of not having enough food resources to feed everyone by 2050?\nOutput: There is no doubt at all that global food production has gone up in the last few decades.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the amount of production to provide a growing world population will be 976 billion pounds in 2017.  That is up from 722 billion pounds in 1999.  That is a 10.7% increase.  That means that the food produced will reach 976 billion pounds in 2050.  The population will be 9 billion then and the food will not have enough to feed them.\nTherefore the total population will be 907 billion people in 2050.  In order to ensure that these people will be able to eat, it will be essential to feed the world\u2019s growing population so that they can be strong enough to compete with other countries in trade and industry.  The global food industry alone is worth $3 trillion.  Without the world\u2019s increasing population, this growing demand will create many problems for farmers.\nThe world is predicted to be 8.7 billion people by 2051, so that will be 11.8 billion people by 2050.  If the world\u2019s food production is to be able to feed 9.7 billion people in 2050 (9.7 billion today plus 11 billion by 2050), that implies that there will need to be an additional 25.2 billion pounds of food produced.  In order to give those 25.2 billion pounds to the world\u2019s hungry people, the global food industry has to grow from today\u2019s value to $3.6 trillion.", "answer": "A: get smart"}

That is, the two options result in the same number of correct choices. For example, if we ask who will pay the most for the fuel, the two options of 2 and 2.5 are exactly the same number of correct answers--2.5.\n\nYou are probably tired by now of hearing me say \"just as much\" (you could say \"just about as much\" or \"as much\" to distinguish the possible values for the output). Why say 'just as much' or 'just about as much' when we have the output, 0.1 and 0.99? Here is an example of why we say 'just as much':\n\nYou know how there has been a big drop in the national unemployment rate over the past year?\n\nIf you knew that there is a big drop in unemployment, then you could use the output of the calculator to calculate the number of people that would be working if it were not for the unemployment rate. In other words, the value of the output of the calculator would be 0.2-0.4.\n\nBecause the calculator outputs the answer 0.1, there is no way to calculate how many people would be working if the unemployment rate were 0, then the output would be 0.1-0.4. So 0.1-0.-1 is 0-4, 4-4 is 0-8, 8-8 is 0-16, 16-16 is 0-32, 32-32 is 0-64, 64-64 is 1-144, 144-144 is 1-256, 256-256 is 1-640, and in short, the output is 1.\n\nIn this case, the reason why we say \"just as much,\" or \"just about as much,\" is because the output is 1 and therefore the answer is 1. If the output is zero, then the answer is 0 and hence the output is zero.\n\nFor example, if you gave the unemployment", "answer": "D: parking lot"}

They pay a tax on every single dollar spent in order to fund government services and welfare programs. For every $1 spent, they get $0.50 back in the form of welfare benefits.\nInput: Each of the three working members of the family pays 20% of each month\u2019s income in taxes. The average monthly income is $18,000. What do these taxes pay for?\nOutput: 50% of these taxes pay for food\n50% of these taxes pay wages to government employees\n50% of these taxpayers pay interest on loans from the government\n50% of these tax payers pay for military defense\nIf you take the 50% out of the top of these taxes, $10 will still be left to spend on food, fuel, rent, and interest on loans for the other taxpayers.\nSo this means that for every 10% that is taken out of the top of the taxes, you are only getting $0.30 back. So the total amount of taxes you would have if you did not tax other people is 50%. If you do not tax other people, you get paid $0.30 back every month for every dollar that you spent. Thus you are now only getting $10 every month for every dollar you spend.\nInput: The national debt has doubled over the past 35 years.  The debt is now $16.2 trillion dollars.

The cost of that car, plus insurance, gasoline and maintenance costs, plus repairs and taxes equals $5 in gas a month.  If he buys another vehicle then he can sell the car for $4 or more. If he buys a second vehicle at $3.90, the second car loses all the gasoline it saved him over the years. So if he buys a third vehicle, he will still face the same problem. The best he can do is to buy a cheaper vehicle and save up the savings for that car or if he has enough money he can buy a new car (and therefore have the gas he saves replace his current vehicle).  The following is a comparison of the prices of a new vehicle and an old vehicle:\nOutput: If he had bought a brand new car for $10 and sold the old car that he did not keep for $8 or less, then he would have spent $3.91 * 10 = $20 on gas a month.\nIf he had bought an old vehicle at $10 and kept it for a year, he would have gone through $20.90 of gas.\nThe difference is $5 from buying a new vehicle at $10 and $5 from buying a second old vehicle at $8 or less. So if he buys an old vehicle at $12 he will save $5 a month after the first old vehicle is sold and $12 from buying a second new vehicle at $12.\nOutput: If he buys a car at $9 and sells the old vehicle that he does not keep, then he will have spent $14 on gas a month.  He will then have lost $15 and has to buy a new vehicle.\nThe difference is 20*9 = $40 from buying a new vehicle and $40 from buying a second new car at $9.\nOutput: If both vehicles are a month old then he will have spent the $40 to buy a new vehicle and the $10 to buy a second vehicle.\nSo Adam will not have more than $6 a month to continue to drive the car he is considering buying. So the final answer is 6", "answer": "D: have lunch"}

If each player serves at 20 yards at a pace of 7:00 feet per second, how many serves per minute is the player on the opposite side allowed to serve?\nOutput: The player on the opposite team of the player, serving at 20 yards, gets to have only 2 serves per minute.  Therefore, in total the player on the opposite team's serve is 10% of the player on the side that is serving.\nThus the player on the side which serves gets to serve half of the serves the other team is allowed per match, and thus half of the shots the player on the other side is allowed to hit are shots he misses\nThus the player on either team gets to play 6% or 0.66 more per match, depending on whether the sides the player on each team is on are playing in the same set\nThus the player on each team gets 2/6 or 0.56 more per match\nSo the total will be 1/6 of 0.56 or 28.5% (2/4*8%)\nThat means the server's serves get 2/6 of 2/6 = <<5/5=50>>50 serves per match\nTherefore his serve only gets 20% per match.

How deep is the river? Does the tidal wave carry away 10 feet, 50 feet or 100 feet of water?\nOutput: The tidal wave carries 10 feet, 50 feet, or 100 feet of water.\nThe total water depth in a tidal wave is 10*4 * 100 = 200feet.\nThe total water that is left in the river after the tidal wave is 2*200 = 200*150 = 100feet.\nIf one person was standing on the ground and the tidal wave was 60 feet deep, then 10%of the total water in the river is gone\nIf one person was on the ground and the tide was 50 feet deep, then 25% of the total water in the tide is gone\nIf one was on the ground and 50 feet deep, then 75% of the total water is gone\nSo 75% of the total amount of tidal wave water is gone.\nInput: The first year of high school students in the US write and answer two science questions.

The total time after he got in the car to do this trip was one hour and twenty minutes. So the total time to fill the truck was two hours.\nSo the total time spent doing this trip was 2+2 = ->2 hrs and two minutes.\nIf we only do this trip once a month, and a trip with the same car is only one hour, we put 2000 blocks into the truck.

What is the first month on record with the highest temperature?\nOutput: 1936 [33.6F] [29.9F] [27.1F] [23.1F]\nThe warmest month on record in the Northern hemisphere was in 1936 with 33.6\u00b0F, followed by 1995's 29.9\u00b0F, 1998's 27.1\u00b0F, and 2005's 23.1\u00b0F\nSo the warmest month on record was 1936, followed by 1995, 1998, and 2005.\n\nInput: The average temperature for the last ten years in Houston is 42.9\u00b0F with no anomalies. In fact, in 2005 the average temperature was 47.9\u00b0F. How would you define normal for Houston?\nOutput: Normal for Houston is 42.9 + 9\u00b0F which equals 49.9\u00b0F. If the temperature has an anomaly, then it is not normal and not statistically significant so it is not normal.\nSo the average temperature in 2005 was 49.9\u00b0F which is not normal but it was an anomaly which makes it not normal.\nThere is no statistical significance at all for 2005's average temperature so it is not normal and is not statistical significant.\nSo the average 2003 temperature was 42.9 + 9.1\u00b0F which equals 49\u00b0F, so it was not normal and is not statistically significant.\nThe average 2000 temperature was 42.8 + 9.6\u00b0F which equals 51\u00b0F, so it is not normal but no anomaly.\nThere are two statistical significance criteria at play for 2003's average temperature of 42.8 + 9 + 9.6\u00b0: It does not have an anomaly, nor does it have two consecutive years with an anomaly.\nSo we can say the average temperatures for 2003 and 2004 were 41.0 and 41.1.\nSo 2004 has the most anomaly and 2004 is the smallest so 2003 has the highest anomaly.\n2008 has both a low annual average and a high anomaly, so the anomaly of 2008 is the highest.\nNow consider how many anomaly years are in 2008 vs in 2003, both of which are only 20 anomaly years, but neither has an anomaly year.\nSo in 2004", "answer": "A: health center"}

How many millimeters is that air pocket?\nOutput: The air pocket does not have to be a perfect sphere.  It can be anything that will allow the ball to pass through it. If the air pocket is only about 1 millimeter and the ball passes through it with the air in that 1 millimeter area then it is \"perfect\" because each air particle does not have to be in the same position in an effort to keep that ball out. If the ball passes through more than 1 millimeter or so of the air then the air particles will \"push\" the ball out of the air pocket through that air particle. If the air pocket has more than 1 millimeter and more than that, but less than 2 millimeters, then it is not a perfect sphere. The air pocket in between is not a perfect sphere, either, so the ball would not pass through that air pocket.\nThus if you were to put a ball into that air pocket and try to get it to bounce off an opposite wall, then you would not get it to bounce off. It would just get stuck. So there is not a perfect sphere in that air pocket.\n\nInput: When the sun moves the direction of the magnetic north pole during a solar eclipse, which direction is the sun moving?  Output: The opposite way.  But then if the earth rotated at the same time then the sun would be moving in the same direction.\nFor simplicity, it would be easier to look at this from above, not below. So just imagine the sun moving in one direction at any one time. Now, when the sun is above the horizon, how much of the day is directly in the sun?  And when the sun is below the horizon, how much must be under the sun?\nOutput: The earth rotates at the same rate, so it is only taking the time it takes to get through a full rotation of the earth.  So the sun is moving in the opposite direction, so we have an opposite direction.  But, of course, the sun only takes a full rotation in one direction, so it would only take a little shorter for the earth to keep", "answer": "E: apartment"}

{"text": "A train ticket is a ticket to a different city or even a different country. Ticket prices vary greatly, depending on distance to the train station, how long it will take, and what type of train you will be on. Prices also vary by country. In the USA most trains take 1 hour to travel from place to place. In India most trains require three to four hours to travel, for example, from Delhi to Mumbai. In Africa, where you are flying to, trains can take as little as 10 minutes to travel a considerable distance.\nThe difference between the rate of price per mile a train costs in the USA and in India, or the difference between the cost of a ticket for a bus in the USA and in Kenya, is that in the USA the ticket can be purchased from a ticket sales office or from a train station or a bus. In the USA you can pay for the train ticket at a ticket sales counter, at the train station, or you can pay on the spot on the train. In India you must purchase the ticket at a ticket booth before on the train.

When they originally announced the ban several years ago, dog fighting was very popular amongst the citizens of the United States. Dogs were used in fights so they could win prizes. Some of the prizes would be worth millions. People would fight and kill for these prizes. So now that the ban is lifted, some of the animal fighting clubs have been dissolved and the dogs that were taken in for hunting will be rehomed.\nThere were however at least 8 dog fighting clubs that remain open in all 50 states and the territories. How many of the clubs exist today and how many are there that were dissolved years ago?\nInput:\nThe United States Animal Fighting Dog Act of 2001 was signed into law by President Bush in October 2001. The Act's primary purpose was to end dog fighting and reduce the number of animals subjected to it.\nAnimal fighting is not legal in the United States unless it occurs on national game reserves, preserves, or wilderness areas. The Act's main component that regulates dog fighting is the Anti-Dog Fighting Law, which makes it illegal to engage in dog fighting, train dogs to participate in dog fighting, or to possess or train animals to participate in dog fighting.\nThe Department of Justice initiated prosecutions against dog fighting clubs in 2001 under the Animal Fighting Dog Prohibition Act of 1999 and the Animal Fighting Dog Protection Act of 2002. As of February 17, 2004, the Justice Department reported that it had charged, prosecuted, or shut down more than 250 dog fighting clubs and held trials against more than 500 abusers.\nThere are three primary components of the Federal Government's effort to curb dog fighting. The first is the Animal Fighting Dog Prosecution Coordinating Committee; the second is the State Department's Animal Fighting Enforcement Initiative; and the third is the United States Dog Fighting Task Force. The federal government estimates that dog fighting affects between 7.3 and 10.3 million people in the United States annually.

Their best friend has two parents working over the summer so they spend all their time playing together together without any adult supervision.   Three of the children have never left the house. The mother is not home when they wake up in the morning or at night. They go to day care during the school period when they are with their parents but when the day care is closed, they go home.

You place a 1 kg block of cheese, a jar of sauce and a box of biscuits on your forklift. A 5 kg block of cheese weighs 5 kg. The 5 kg block is placed at the end of the lift arm. The 5 kg block of cheese then gets dropped by the forklift, which knocks the lid off the bucket. You take the box of biscuits and place it on your wheelbarrow, which gets lifted into the 5 kg block. The jar of sauce gets dropped at the end of your forklift and into the lower end of the bucket, which now has half of the contents.

The kind of ball bearing used will depend on the size, stiffness and weight of the balls. If the ball diameter is 100 mm, the friction force is 0.5 mm. If it is 5 mm, the friction force will be 1.8 mm.

So 4 gears costs $30/hour.  The 5th car is a 4-speed fast car. It costs 50$/hour to drive that car. So it costs 50$ for 1 hour to drive.  The 6th car is a 4:2 Speed car. It costs 100$/ hour to drive. And it costs 100$ for 1 hour if you drive that car with 2 people.  The 7th car is a 5 speed car. It costs 120$/hour to drive. And it must have 5 gears to go faster.

The boat has been sailing south-east the entire time.  The average speed for the boat at this speed is 25* 12 = 55 m/min.  Hence, the average speed for the boat heading south is 25* 5 = 25*25*45 = 25% faster than it was heading north.  Since the average speed for the two heading north is 25* 5 = 15*7 = 25*5, the average speed for it heading south is 25*5/15 = 12*3/15 = 12%.  Thus this is a 25% change in direction.\nInput: Two teams of two players each play a game.  One team, each in the same division, must score 30 more points than the other team to win.

How does the health of the mother affect the father's number of children?\nOutput: If the father is the healthiest at conception, the mother is the healthiest afterwards, his number of children is proportional to the health of the mother at conception.\nIf the mother is unhealthy at the father's conception, the father's number of offspring is proportional to the mother's health at conception.\nIf it is impossible to tell the father's health at conception from the mother's, you make the assumption that the father's health is the healthiest and that the mother is the healthlest. If you're doing this, then the fertility curve for a father and a mother should be the same except for the interval at conception and birth. That means it would appear that only the healthiest couple would have kids. But if you assume that the fertility curve is a sine wave, and that each person has a constant fraction of their potential children's potential at conception, then both parents have a finite number of children. The only difference between the total number of kids they have, and the total number given by the curve, is the fraction of their potential children who die before their birth.\n\nInput:One person has more than two children at one time.

So 5,000,000 / 20,0000000 = 2,000,000.\nThe sun is 40,000 * 2 = 70,000 miles away the northern/southern hemisphere  and 70,000 * 6000 = 5,000,000 = 80,000 miles away\nThat means the sun is 30,000 * 6000 = 6000 miles away the northern/ southern hemisphere.\nAnd the earth is 30,000 * 5 = 3000 miles away the northern/Southern hemisphere\nSo the sun is 16,000,M and earth is 32,000,000 - 3000\nAlso that is how far the moon is compared to the sun, a 100,000,000 miles farther.\n\nInput:A team of people gets up at 8 am and spends 8 hours at a local office performing the same job.

He receives $100 a month of this as a tax credit.  What is Mr. M\u2019s total tax liability?\nOutput: Mr. M\u2019S total tax liability is $1,240.  That is, he paid $1,200 in taxes, got $100 as a tax credit and owes $960. That means he paid $960 in taxes in total, or $500 of them in federal and $960 in state (where he lives).\nSo that works out to $100 (tax credit) x $960 (tax liability) = $500/960 = $80\nSo the total amount of money Mr. M paid in taxes (tax credit, payment of tax liabilities) was $160.00\nThat's a total of $1680.00\n(or roughly $15.60/hour)\nSo the final answer will be 15\n\nInput:  When a truck fills up with gasoline, it takes 5 gallons of the gas to light it up.

The additional salary is the only reason he is working now, not because he is bored and wants to earn more.\nOutput: His new salary per year is $100,000.  He would now have the same salary as before, but now he gets paid an extra 2000 per month to help cover the cost of rent per month for a house he rents.\nTherefore the change in his total income is $2000 x 2500 * $100,000 = $250,000\nSo for example, if it took him a year to pay off the initial loan on his home, and then the additional income he receives is the only reason he needs to work, then that extra 250 is going to pay off about 75% of his mortgage.\nIn other words, his total income changed from $250,000 to $350,000.  If he did not receive an extra 2000 from his landlord, then the income would have stayed the same, only his total income would have increased by 2000.\nIf he had not been given a raise, then the total number of additional income he would have received would have remained the same, and his total income would have been the same.  Even assuming that that option is available, the additional income was much more valuable to him than the total change in his income, which is why he took advantage of the raise.\nInput:John is in a plane that has to land.

So he eats 1000/1000 = <<1000/1000=600>>600 bags of candy a day.\nOutput: 60 bags of candy takes 1200*600 = <<6000*600=2478>>2478.\nHe needs 2478 bags because 1200*600/600=600 bags of candy a week.  If he ate 1000 pieces a day, he would still need 1200 bags a month to keep up with his candy consumption.\nOutput: If he only eats candy for one week, the 600 bags of candy a week lasts him 12 months.  If he eats 1000 pieces of candy a week for three months, then the 12 months last for 1.5 years.\nIf he eats 1000 pieces of candie a month for two months, then the 3 month period of time will pass him by and one year will go by without him eating candy.\nSo 12*12 = >>2478*2= >>1000 for 6 months*6 months.

The choices will be: b) a can of peaches c) a can of pecans d) apples\nOutput: You need to purchase 2000 snacks.  You will also need 2000/2000 = 10 cans of peaches and 10 cans of pecans.  You also need to buy 2000/2000 = 10 can of peaches and 10 can of pecans. You will also need 2000*2000 = 5000 cans of peaches and 5000 cans of pecans\nThe total cost of the snack is 2000*5000 = <<2000/2000=40>>40 cans of peaches and 50 cans of pecans (and then 2 cans of pecans for after the movie)\nThat means it costs you $40 for the snacks AND", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

James then rents the apartment out for $700.  How much did airbnb pay him? $950.

People do not need the teacher to do that for them or themselves.  Many students will go to any lengths to get what they want or need.

In this case, they will do whatever they can to get a B or better on the assignment written by other people, so as to get a C or better on that assignments.\nWhen a student receives a C or below on an assignment, they immediately become very upset, angry and frustrated with themselves for receiving such a low grade.  They feel bad and start looking for a way to cheat the test.  They immediately think they need to get extra help from the teacher.  Therefore, they will think of different ways to get good grades.

Students who receive special help are given a specific number of specific grades, in order to allow for that student to be able to get to the level where he is capable of working well with other students.  In any grade the special help number is one above which the student may receive individual assistance.  It must be within a certain range, because that student's needs may differ in other ways.  To find out if the student may benefit from special help, he must have done well in his learning.  If he does not have done well in his understanding of the text, then he may not have the skills required.  To find which of these is true, the principal looks at the student's work, and writes down the grade given for each book that the student had not done well in.  If his assignment on the books did not meet the requirements, he writes it down as incorrect.  If the assignment was correct, but the student was not able to complete it due to the difficulties the text presented, then his work is marked correct, and the student receives one grade lower than the minimum required for that grade.  If the student's work is correct, but the teacher believes he can help the student to understand the material better, he gives the student a few extra points on those assignments to compensate, and the student receives the grade he is normally expected to have.  If the student does not have the required skills, then the student's book is marked \"special needs\" by the teacher, and the work assigned to him is given a lower grade.  If the teacher determines that a student is not getting enough credit for his work, or that extra credit should be applied to one of his assignments instead, he writes the same thing down in the textbook for that", "answer": "E: control"}

Using these numbers the computer can generate any number within the range of numbers in one group.  For example, it can generate numbers from 0 to 25, or 0 to 16, or 0 to 4, or 0 to 12, or 0 to 9, or 0 to 4+12, or 0 to 6+8, or 0 to 2+1+4+5+1+5+1+,...\nOutput: Any number up to the largest possible range in the set can be generated. So if a computer can generate any number between 0 and 16 + 0-1+0-0-0+0, then that number can be generated up to and including the largest possible range in any set. So if the set begins with the smallest possible difference between the two possible integers and grows by 1 until it reaches the largest possible difference possible, then any number can also be generated up until and including the largest possible set in the set by incrementally increasing the smallest possible difference between two numbers.\nInput: Using any number within the range [0,16]+0,1,... the computer can generate a random 1-12.  The computer can also also generate random 1-12+2+0+0,1,...\nOutput: A random digit sequence between 0-1, 2-3,...+1,3,...+3,...+3+6,...\n\nInput: The price of a loaf of bread is $.50 per loaf.

The total cost of producing 3 million pounds of steel is 50  dollars.  What is more likely:  1. To put up a new manufacturing plant?  2. To buy scrap from someone who can use it to produce steel?\nInput: The total price of producing one mill ton of steel is $903.  The price is only $53 if the steel was used to produce 20 million pounds of steel.  However the scrap prices are much higher than the steel so the scrap prices would be the more likely explanation.\nInput: The daily cost of making a $50,000,000 investment is $6.  The average price for a mill-ton of steel in the 1960s was $17.  Thus the annual cost of making a $100,000,000 investment was $90,000,000\nOutput: The difference between the average price and the daily cost is $2.6 million.\nSo the total cost of making 20 million pounds of steel was $6/ $50,000, 000,000+ $2.6 = $9\n\nInput: Adam and Michael are at a gas station.

After a month, he took the 5 million and quit the sales call business. He took the 5 million and sold 1 pound of flour for 400 yen. How much did he make in each month after the month he quit?\n\nOutput:For the 5 million yen which he was paid after the first month, he got a 5 million yen salary. Plus 500 yen after the first month, equals a 5000 yen salary.\nThe income after the first month is 5000 yen/2000 yen = 550 yen.\nSo after the first month of his new job, he made 12000 yen.\nSo the final income after 1 month of his new job is 12000+500+550 = 135000 yen.\nSo he made 135000 yen in one month\n\nInput: James is having trouble sleeping, so he went to his wife and asked her to take care of it.

How much water does this person need?\nOutput: 30 / 2*3 = <<30/2*3=36>>36 = 30 liters of water\nSo a 30 year old would need 48 liters of water to actually be able to survive on one gallon of fluid in a week\nSo the total water supply for that person is 48\n\nInput: The cost to fill an air-purifying machine at one million litres per minute is 300,000 cents. The rate at which water is used in an air-purifying unit is 100 m3/min, and a typical residential house uses a shower or bathtub as a continuous water supply source. It is therefore expected that one person uses an air-purifying water supply system in the average home for about 100 years. The cost for a water tank at this standard supply rate is 1.8 million dollars. This number represents the cost of materials and the cost of labor and equipment, plus the insurance costs of maintaining and repairing the tank.\nIf you live in a home that has not used the water supply system in 100 years how much water do you use each year?\nOutput: Given the information above, 1,000 litres of water will still be needed each year.

For a 1 3/4 x 2 3/4 x 2 2/2 joint a 3/4 \u00d7 2.5 3/4 x 2.5 x 2 2/2 = 3 3 /2.5 = 30 percent of the wood is used.\nOutput: A cross section joint may be formed by placing both pieces of wood together on the plane, taking a piece of wood from one end and holding it in the plane, then inserting the piece of wood into the other end, and taking a piece of wood off the plane and holding it in the same way.  The joint strength of this method may be approximately 2.5, as opposed to over 7 for a cross section through two pieces held together with two 1-/2-inch strips of wood. This may be sufficient to hold 6\" long pieces of lumber together, but may be ineffective for heavier 3\" long pieces because two 2-inch wood strips or jointed 2 1/2\" long pieces will not hold 6\" long lumber in tension or compression.", "answer": "C: isolation"}

Also, try to use the smallest pieces of the bag as possible to save costs.\nOutput: The bag's cost will be 5 cents per bag (less than 2 cents per bag if you cut the costs of the smaller plastic pieces).  So it will cost $3 to fill the plastic bag.\nIf you add the cost of the taping to the cost of the plastic bags (e.g. 2 cents), the total cost will not be $5.  Therefore you save $2 plus a dollar cost saving of the bag.\nSubtract 2*1/8=1/8 of the plastic bag's cost.  The cost of cutting the bags is about 1.1 cents per bag.\nIt takes you 4 hours to fill the garbage can.  Therefore you get paid $9.\n\nInput: If you were the last person who entered this house and decided to stay in the room where you are, what would you do in all the time you would have in this room?\nOutput: Drink 8 glasses of wine, have one beer and pee in the shower.\n\nInput: Which three of these items may sound like a good idea to you?\nOutput: 1.

This is true if the pile is a square and the height of the wall on 3 sides is 60 centimeters. True? False? If not, why not?\nOutput: The number of blocks one person puts into a pile of stones is greater than, and equal to than, 1 when the walls of the stone pile are 60 cm apart from each other. True? False?\nIf the stones are 10 cm in length and 1 cm in width, then the number of blocks a person puts in a pile is less than, and less than the number of blocks a single block requires. True? False?If not, why not? Answer: Since a pile of stones has a uniform height of 60 cm, its height does not fall away from the ground when there is less than a single block between it and the ground.\nThis leads to the conclusion: If the height of stones in a square tower with a length of 6 meters and a width of 2 meters and a uniform height is less than or equal to 60 cm, the total number of blocks in the tower does not fall away when one person is trying to throw stones towards it.\nExample:\nConsider a tower with a height of 20 meters, a height of 3 meters, and a length of 4 meters. For a pile of stones, the total height of the tower is 80 feet.\nThe height is 60 cm.

He lay on his back, and as he moved his arm, his left leg began to move and his right foot moved. Then he would pull his left arm, and his right leg would move.

He looked in the mirror to see if his body was distorted or if his eyes were droopy. He thought: He can't do this. So he tried to get up, and just as his hand reached the back of the bed, he knew he was going to vomit on the other bed. He threw up in the sink, wiped himself and his clothes, ran into the bedroom, and lay down. He put his head back into the pillow, looked at his wife or his daughters.

{"text": "One person using the boat radio to call it's base sends five messages every day.  The person using the subsea radio to call its base sends four messages every day.  Another person using the boat radio takes turns using the submarine radio every day.\nOutput: The submarine has a capacity of 80 * 100 = 1600 messages a day.\nIf all 1600 messages are received for each day, the submarine is sent an average of 80 messages every day, or 400 messages per day.\nSo after four months the submarine had 100 messages remaining.\nIf it were 10 people working each day to keep everything updated or updated by someone else, they would have 150 messages remaining in a year.\nIf it took 10 people one year to carry out their job, they would run out of messages in a month and have to contact the base where it was located again.\nSo if each person working on the submarine sent 150 messages per day, the submarine would have 300 messages remaining after one year.\nIf it was 10 people working to keep everything updated or updating by someone else, they might as well work on the submarine as they do the base.\nIf it took ten people one week to carry out their job on the submarine, this would be equivalent to a sub being on standby for 4 days.\nIf it was the same for the submarine and the base, then a submarine could be sent to cover for a base.  This would be a good use of the submarine and would likely make it more useful in the army rather than the navy.\nInput: What sort of radio do someone use to receive messages from the outer world?\nOutput: The radio can send signals, but it cannot receive them.

The frequency is therefore unpredictable.\nThe satellite has a range of about 120 km, so messages can be sent around the globe.\nWhat are the chances that no outside messages would occur in a given time period?\nOutput: If a person is in a desert, there will be no messages from the outer world for the first three or four days after they arrive.\nIf a desert can reach an ocean and then go into space for another week, they still have to deal with the fact that their satellite is only available every other day.\nThe satellite therefore has a", "answer": "C: transistor"}

{"text": "No\n\nInput: The average person is about 10% of their peak weight after a season of training.  The size of the body doubles for every 1% above peak.  For athletes to be their best, they must reach their peak after training to maintain their quality of life.  To achieve maximum health while retaining a body that meets their goals, we must work at 100% fitness, without rest.\n\n The following example shows a graph of an average 10-year-old female in which peak is at age 30.  Peak height for her is at age 39.  Since the average male is about 33 years old, an athlete at age 27 can achieve peak height at age 26.\n\n Example: John and Mary have a son who is six years old.  They start him early, and for nine months they follow their fitness advice, and he gains four pounds of lean body mass. However, since John has arthritis, he has to stop and spend four hours of sleep every night. John gets up once a night.  This takes him eight hours.  By contrast, it takes Mary 30 minutes to get up.  She spends about the same amount of time awake. This has a profound effect on John's body composition. He weighs about 70% of his peak.\n\n Example: A 30-year-old male who is in great shape is assigned to work at a construction site. During his time there, he gains eight pounds, mostly in muscle. After his time he is assigned to a job that is physically demanding, and he still gains muscle as he progresses in his duties. When he is done, he is a big guy.\n\n Example: A 50-year-old man, a bodybuilder, spends most of his days either in prison or in the rehabilitation center. While in prison he maintains a 10% body fat weight, and at the same time, maintains his strength. Before he enters the rehabilitation center, the man's body is in great shape, and he begins his fitness routine three days a week.\n\n Example: A 45-year-old man who never skis because he's so afraid of injuring his back, never loses weight, and never cuts down on his alcohol intake has a career that is characterized by great power, stamina, and control. He is a huge, aggressive, and very well built man.

It is located at the southern end of the Indian Ocean, south of Australia, Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia. In 2015, there were approximately 33,000 seismic events per year. However, the largest of these was a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that killed thousands due to its epicenter being in the Southern Sumatra province of Malaysia.\nIn 1788 A.D. (the year after it was founded) the population of the Philippines reached 1,450,000 people. However, by the year 1791 it was reduced by more than 75% to a population of just 700,000 people. From there, the population of the Philippines was reduced again to 650,000 in 1821 and to 50,000 people in 1895.\nThe population of the Philippines again hit a massive high point in 1900. By the year 1900, the country had a population of 11,000,000 people. However by the year 1951 it had fallen to 10,000,000 people and to 50,000 by the", "answer": "C: aircraft carrier"}

But the probability is that they are all authentic car registrations and not fraudulent. Also the probability that the car registrations are genuine is not very good.\nOutput: For every 100,0000 people in the city, there are 16000 genuine car registrations. For those 16000 registrations, the city will earn $3,000.\n\nInput: A car makes 10,000 miles per year. If the car needs to be repaired after 100,000 miles, then the car is now worth $20,000 because the repair will cost $50.  What is the probability that the car will need $50 to fix it, given that everyone in the city drives a real car?\nOutput: 10,000 miles is a long time for a car, so there is a high probability that the cars need repairs after 100,000 miles. The probability that the car will break down is also high, so the probability of needing repairs after 100,000+ miles is also high.\nOutput: If we assume the probability of car breaking down is 9/1 and the probability of needing repairs is 5% then the car will break down after 100,000 miles\n\nInput: If the city allows more than 20 stores to sell wine inside their buildings they will lose more money than if they do not allow stores to sell wine inside the buildings  How much more?\nOutput: 20 stores allow 20 stores to shop inside the cities buildings.

He used a bucket and was going to continue when he heard his wife call out.  He went to clean the train, but when he arrived he found the box empty and several train cars lying around.  What was the problem?\nOutput: The \"train set\" was a set of cars for driving on the road.  The man picked up the train cars and took them home with him.\nNow the problem is not that the train set never had a train box or it was empty, it was that the people who built the train set had not properly tested it for air leaks.  This happened because the designer decided cars were more interesting than trains and didn't want to work too hard on the air leakage problem.  So the man had to drive his own train on \"empty\" model railroad tracks, with a bucket in one hand and a broom in the other.\n\nClick the images for more examples\n\nInput:The car weighs 7.5KJ and costs $16,000 to fix and is worth $8,000 to sell. The engine has an oil pressure warning light so the owner replaces the engine for $6,000 and puts an automatic oil pressure alarm in the car. The car will last 10,000 miles with no expense.  The oil price for a gallon of crude oil in the United States in March 1990 is $3.40. If the oil is sold at $12 a gallon, the owner gets $36 for the change. How much does the owner profit from the oil?\nOutput: The owner needs to put $6,000 into the engine to fix it and the cost of the engine is $6,000.  However, he does not need to sell it. He will have a hard time selling just the engine. So he keeps it and puts the cost of the oil into the car.\nSo overall the oil cost him $6,000 just to get the car and has cost him more the 10,000 miles of driving\nThus after the oil cost he makes $36.\n\nInput:The average length of time for a person to recover from", "answer": "E: falling down"}

Also he fell onto the ground three more times.\nWhen you are trying to run from someone, you run for 300 yards over ground.  But once you have fallen from someone, you run 300 yards over the same spot again.  So if he ran over ground at the start, you would count him as running 400 yards over ground from the start to the end.\nSo when Bob left the store he ran the last 400 yards over ground at 300 yards a time over a distance of 300 feet.  You then use the distance from the end to the start of that 300-yard run as a unit of distance.  So for the 300 yards he started, there was a total distance of 400-200 = <<400-200=300>>300 feet.  It's like counting a mile as 400 yards divided by the total distance of 400 yards (that is the same distance of land he ran).  So since 300 yards is 300 feet, then the total distance he ran over ground is 300 * 300 = <<300 * 300=1800>>1800 feet.\n\nInput: There are 5 men in a city, each with a car.

They would take two buses from London to Oslo, 3 trains to Oslo, and then take a ferry over from Norway to Iceland.  Their total trip cost them $9,000.  Alice was making $2,000 per year.  John was earning $10,000 per year. To reduce costs, they booked both trains and buses.  In total, they would spend $16,000.  They would save another $4,000 by only booking bus tickets, as buses are usually cheaper than trains.  On the other hand, they would spend another $2,000 by booking bus tickets when they arrived in Oslo.  They will save $4,000, so in total they spent $17,000.  Alice earned $2,000 more per year, so her total income is $18,000 per year. John earned $2,000 per month, so his total income is $25,000 per month. The result is they only saved $4,000 each month.\nNow let's suppose their travel costs were $25 per month, and their income was $25,000 per year. That is, they paid $55 per month for the two buses, $1,080 for the train tickets, and $1,120 for the boat tickets. (Note that they had not budgeted for the ferry.)\nThey therefore saved $2,000 per quarter, which means that for the entire year they saved $3,300.

You need to run 1270km through the rainforest to the airport.  Of that time, 300km is dry. If you run at an average speed of 8km/h you can cover the ground in 5h 30m.  How fast can you run if you do it in 5h 30m? You might run 3km in 24h. If you run at your average speed of 8km per hour, you can run in 24h 40m.\nOutput: To cover the entire runway in 5h 30m, you will need to run at maximum speed of 8km per half hour. Of that speed, 3km will be on the dry runway and another 3km will be on wet.\nSo the final speed of your run is 10km / half hour at the speed you are going.\nSo the flight will take 14h 20m if you do it at the speed you are running.\nAlso if you cover the whole runway in 3h half an hour, this flight takes 21h 40m.\n\nInput:Johns goes to the gym 3x a week for 1hr 25mins/day.

The interest rate has three sides: 3% for the annual percentage rate, 2% for the monthly interest rate, and the interest on the principal is the total interest rate.  The total interest rate on a three-year loan of $100,000 is $5000 / 3.  For a six-month loan of $10,000, the total principal is $5000 / 2 / 6 / 6.  So the total interest rate on a six-month loan is $400 / 6 / 6 = $20.  The monthly interest rate is $400 / 6 = $24.  Her loan will have a total cost of $8,640.\nInput: The rate at 6% per month is the rate on a monthly loan.  It has a total cost of $24.50.\nHer loan will have the cost of $24.60.\nThe principal is the total cost of $24 * 6% per month = $20.00 per month\nSo the total cost is $24 / 6 6 $60 = $20.50\n\nOutput:The dollar worth of gasoline you would pay on your car if you drove your car for 10 years instead of buying gasoline only every 3 years is the cost of gasoline per year.

The glass is made of 1-10% water and the first and middle questions have different answers. The second, third, and fourth questions both get answers that are A.

Let's say he is not bothered by the higher cost. So his monthly cost is $27.70.\nOutput: After two days of working he will have earned $27.70, or $2.26/day. This works out to $9.90/day or $4.45/day each time.\nSo the monthly cost of two days out of school is $14.70, or$3.60/day. The 11-year old will have saved $5.60 each day.\nSo the final income of $1.60 is less than $5.60. However, this is only $5.80 a day for two days he has not come into school. If he were in school he would have spent the extra $0.30 of money he is spending not working on food or clothing or school, and got $6.60 extra each day because of it.\nThis gives him extra money every day that he is not in school or not paying for food, clothes, or school.\nSo the final average income of two days out of his school would be $25.50. The final total is $25.00/day, and he will end up losing around $1.50 every time he is allowed to come out of school.\nInput: Let's say you work for six months and earn $100 a month.

Total for a week is 8000 gallons of gasoline and 8000 gallons of fuel.\nIf they change their vehicle each four weeks, the total will be 6000 gallons of gasoline and 6000 gallons of fuel that need to be replaced every four weeks.\nTherefore, the total is 6000**2 = <<60**2=24>>24 gallons of gasoline and 6400 **2 = <<24**2=12>>12 gallons of propene.\nIf they change every 12 weeks, the total consumption will be 5000 ***12^12 = <<12^12>1276 gallons of propene and 5000 ***12^12^12 = <<36^12>1256 gallons of gasoline.\nSo the final consumption will be 3676 * 12^12 = >>3676 = 3675 gallons of propene and 3675 * 12^12 * 12 = >>3675  gallons of gasoline.\nTherefore, the final consumption will be the total amount of propene in fuel. It is 26750 gallons of propene.  As such, it is 26750/3675 = <<24750/3675>>24750 gallons of gasoline.\n\nInput:Jackie and David are filling the two cars with gas.

{"text": "When it is out, it can easily be seen by cars driving by.\nSo it plays in public places.\n\nInput: The amount of effort spent in swimming is called your \"effort-per-minute efficiency.\" The standard definition is to give the best possible swimmer 200 strokes or so one minute apiece. However, there is one more possible definition; to give the best possible swimmers 200 strokes worth one minute apiece while everyone else finishes one minute worth of swimming, which would take all but the best athletes. Suppose, for argument's sake, there is more than one way to get that definition. Namely, the effort-per-minute efficiency is the speed (or time) at which to accomplish the fastest 200 strokes. Given this definition, which type of swimmer would get the most possible results?\n\nOutput: It is possible to swim faster than 50% of the time.\nBut it would allow a swimmer to only do 100 strokes or so in one minute apiece.\nBut it would give the best swimmer 200 strokes in one minute apiece, where 200 times 1 is 5 hundredths, which is 10% more than 50% of the total pool.\nAnd that would only be possible if the best swimmer had 200 effort-per-minute efficiencies for each of 200 strokes, in other words it would only work if all 20 people worked at the same effort-per-minute. So the best swimmers would need to produce 200 times 2x 100-seconds effort per minute effort.\n\nInput: John is holding on to a pole for the duration of a mile on a sunny day... at a steady pace of 10 mph.

If all 24 animals are mistaken for the teacher's names, the wrong person receives what is wrong -- the award for the person closest to the truth, otherwise called the \"winner.\"\nOutput: When the animals are shown, each child gets to say if there is a match between her or his animal and the correct animal's name, or if there is a wrong animal named for the correct animal.  If the parents' names are correct, the person that incorrectly named the animal gets to \"win\" the award.  If all the children get it wrong, they all get the award.\n\nFor example, if all 24 animals had been shown the picture of a fox, the correct animal's name would have been given as fox, the wrong animals got octopus, they got fish, and this is the correct animal named by the teacher's name. If some of the animals were shown the picture of a squirrel instead of a fox, what animal got octopus? That animal got squirrel. Then someone guessed the correct animal's name as squirrel, the animal's name was given as squirrel, and so forth. But if some animals had been shown the same picture as fox, this was not the animal's name. Then one of them guessed the right animal's name, and the other animals guessed squirrel.

Therefore John makes 1000$ weekly.\nThis means that if John receives $600 a week in wages, it means he earns $200 a week.\n\nInput: What was the most common use of a telephone in the United States in 2003?\nOutput: For answering calls, the most common use was:  A: To dial B: To call C: To hang up D: To change numbers\nThis is the correct answer: A\nThe second answer is C.

They are paid $100 per day or $10 for each hour they work.\nThey build the bridge using concrete, with a 40-foot diameter concrete tower on the corner of each pier.  They also require 300 truck trips. Using trucks for the bridge construction saves the bridge builders 20% of the money they need to pay truck drivers. Each truck trip costs $300.  They estimate that it will take 18 months to complete.  One hundred of their coworkers pay an additional $600 to build the bridge each week.\nWhen the bridge is completed, the bridge builders take to their trucks and head back to work.  Each week there is a different set of railroad workers, including the engineers, working on the bridge.  Some weeks there are eight bridge builders and some weeks there are only six workers.\nAfter 8 months are up, the city of 150 people is about 80 miles from the city of 50 people.  The bridge builders take their trucks back to their homes for two weeks to rest, renew their spirits, and collect the rewards they deserve.\nOne of their coworkers is a truck driver. He has to buy fuel for his own truck, so he hires the bridge builders to fill his truck with fuel for free.  When the bridge builders go home, they leave behind a box with $600 for the driver.  They know that the driver will be happy because he doesn\u2019t have to pay for fuel.\nWhen the bridge builders come back to work, they find a box left by the driver with $600 on it and a note:\n\nI have an idea for you.\n\nThe cost of filling up the truck with $600 worth of gasoline would be $450; the cost of fuel for the drivers during the week was about $200.  The total fuel cost to the bridge builders for a week\u2019s work is about $650.\nOn the other side of the bridge there is a small city of 100 people.

With that much nut in his house, why doesn't he use them more?\nOutput: Adam bought 3 * $12 = 3 * 36 = 3.5 * 36.\nEach kilogram of nuts costs him 8* $8 = $12 and each kilogram of dried fruit cost him 2.5 * $12 + 8* $8 = 16* $8.\nAdam therefore purchases 3 * $12 = 8 * 36 = 96 + 4 = 96 kilograms of nuts and 2 * $12 = 16 * 96 = 320 kg of dry fruit.\nHe purchases 96 + 4 = 960* 3 + 320 * 4 = 960 kilograms of nuts and 320 * 4 = 960 kg of dried fruit.\nThen he purchases 16 * 960 = 1280* 2 + 960 * 4 = 960 kgnuts and 16 * 960 = 960 kg dried fruit.\nThus, he purchases 960 kgnuts and 960 kg dried fruit. And he buys 960 kgnuts and 960 dried fruit.\nSo each one of those things cost him $96 and each one of those things costs him $320. Now, as he says in his explanation, it costs him $96 to store that 120 kg of nuts and $320 to store that 120 kg dried fruit.\nSo he spent $960 * 120 == $1920 = $6160.\nSo the final result for Adam's purchases was 2*240*36 / 960 = 484 * 480 = 2448.\nAnd if he bought 3kg of nuts and 3 kg dried fruit at the same time, and each time bought the same amount of nuts and dried fruit", "answer": "C: table"}

{"text": "Exercise + Jogging = Exercise > Jogging\nBut why do people jog? The answer, of course, is to gain pleasure.\nExercise + Jogging does not need to be \"just\" exercise. There are several other options that one could include with Exercise + Jogging. They would include eating, being with others, watching a movie, getting a bath etc. If one includes eating (which is a good idea), then one must of course think of the importance of eating. In this case, eating is so important that one has to include it. Also, people should think of going to a movie while a movie is being played. If the movie doesn't include eating or even has food in it, then one shouldn't go. If one includes watching a movie without eating, then one should probably think of doing something else the rest of the time.\nIn another situation, the person running should eat during the running time. People running would probably find it enjoyable if they could eat while doing the exercise.\nIf one doesn't eat during running, then one can only go to sleep during exercise. If one doesn't fall asleep during exercise, then one can only get up during exercise. The list of activities the person runs in could go on long, but the point is that one wouldn't just run to walk and eat, and one wouldn't just stand on a treadmill all the time.\nIn the end, exercising and jogging seems to be the perfect activities to add to the normal exercise routine. It can provide great enjoyment and is good for one's health (even if it's just jogging).\n\nInput: the number of miles a person walks in a week may vary widely depending on various factors.  The goal is to get to a point where the person can't tell the time because he has to constantly look around.  How many miles a person can cover in a week?\nOutputs: To finish a week of work in a week of walking would require at least 538.5 miles = 3.25 days = 24.5 miles a day (a mile takes 3.2 seconds to run). So walking 24.5 miles per day would take 7.56 hours.\n\nInput: what happens on a day where you run from point A.  to B on the beach and then run back to your house.

{"text": "At groceries A, a shopper can buy a $10 bag from any of the following stores:  supermarket B: home C : store D : hardware store (with coupon)\nEach person gets 4 bags, so a shopping bag will cost $10.  The shopping bag is made of a heavy, durable fabric and is usually colored green.\nIn supermarkets A, customers are able to get $10 grocery bags that are made of cloth, but only when they get their groceries from store B.  The store B bags are made of less durable material and are usually purple.\nPeople who buy groceries from B will also be able to get a coupon for a free grocery bag worth $10, but this coupon expires the second they buy groceries from store B.\nSo in supermarkets A, customers with free shopping bags will be able to buy groceries without using coupons.  The coupon will always be available in a paper form, however.\nIn supermarkets C, buying groceries without coupons can cost you money. The coupons on store B paper are valid for the duration of the year, however they will expire the first time you go to the grocery store on a different day. They will not be valid for the next 10 months.\nSome supermarket shoppers buy the coupons by themselves when they want them, but not all shoppers buy the coupons. Some shoppers will just get a free grocery bag worth 50% less than the coupon if they bring the coupons when they shopping for groceries.\nWhen shopping in the market for groceries, some shoppers will buy one or more bags of groceries to take home with them. They will likely go back to the store later and order groceries in the store.\nSo, supermarkets C and D are more likely to have shoppers buy a shopping bag of groceries to take home from one of their stores. That makes a shopping bag of grocery bags more valuable than a grocery bag from supermarket A.\nIn supermarkets E and E, people will not be able to go back to store B and buy another paper coupon. Instead, they and all the other people in the store will be automatically given $10 grocery bags that can be used for the rest of the year.\nIn department stores including supermarkets E and E, the people buying groceries will have to make a decision:  do they want their groceries for free, or should they pay a fee for having their groceries delivered when they shop at department stores D and E?\nThis is the primary incentive for customers in supermarket C and E.

{"text": "Travel sickness is described as a feeling of discomfort because of the stress of long-distance travel.  Jet lag on the other hand is described as a feeling that time is running very slow after the plane has landed because the earth is still spinning.  Each can be treated with different remedies.  If you choose a medication that will alleviate one, you will feel better for a short time then you will get sick again.  If you choose to relocate because you are tired of being on the road, you may sleep through the night and wake up feeling better during the second day, but you may be tired and sick during the last days of travel.  The most reliable cures for jet lag is staying in a place where people speak your language, having a good diet, not exercising too much and staying on the jet that has landed for as long as possible (or as little as possible) before getting on the next plane.\nTo alleviate travel sickness, always pack healthy snacks, hydrate with water and take medicine for the most common symptoms that may include dizziness, nausea, headaches, lightheadedness and fatigue. To avoid jetlag, sleep on that plane for 3 days after landing and drink orange juice, fresh mangoes or watermelon juice to help you feel better.  To prevent travel sickness, drink juice made with fresh-squeezed orange juice to help you drink it faster.\nTo alleviate motion sickness, when you feel like you are going to vomit or have to go to the bathroom, drink some water and have your head tilted back on the seat while you eat. If your stomach hurts, try to eat ginger, lemon, lime, ginger syrup, ginger beer, ginger ale, ginger water and water.  Many people feel better with a ginger ale/ginger or pineapple combination.\nTo alleviate fatigue, if you feel like you will fall asleep on the airplane, avoid drinking coffee.  Eat foods like apples, bananas and other fruits.  You may also like to eat some plain whole grain bread.  Also have your water bottle close to you.\n\nInput: The following is a math problem.

{"text": "A: pet dog B: hear sounds and reproduce  C: make love D: drive cars  E: see a movie  F: eat pizza and ice cream\n### Instruction:Answer A and B\nOutput:  D: see a movie E: have sex\n### Explanation:When humans hear or see sounds, they react and generate responses and also perform actions. We can identify different types of noises because some types of sounds can stimulate different responses. In addition, humans are able to react at different times depending on their location and body position. A dog petting can be heard and appreciated by one person, but most people respond to petting the dog by touching their foot to the dog. A human hearing can also be heard by another person and appreciated by that person, while a human hearing can also be ignored by the person and not appreciated by any person. We can also make changes based on our location.\n\nInput: John and Jane have identical twins.  The twins have identical DNA and each of them is born without any organs or blood cells or hair.

The man does not use the money, but sends the tickets to an acquaintance. The acquaintance is killed the next day. How many people died in the first year after the man sent the tickets?\nOutput: The total number of people who died after the man sent the ticket was 20. So, the total number of people killed when the man did not use the money for himself/themselves was now 60. Add 6 to the amount that he sent to his buddy and divide by 56, which is 56. So, since 56 is the answer, 60/56 is 5. That means the total of the 20 people that died were 600. So the total of the 60 people that died for one movie was 800. That means there were 12,000 people in the first year. So the total population of the world is 8% more than it was 3 years ago.  10 years ago, the world population was 7.2 billions, it is now 8.4.

Each of the 5 waitresses brings $5 bills to the table that will cover the bill for the other 2 waitresses. The bills are put into a bag and are handed to the person who is eating.\nOutput: You each bring $5 bills to the dinner table in the restaurant. The waitresses in front of you each bring $2 bills. Your total is $15. You are asked to pay the bill of the waitress who brought you $2. You pay her $5 and $12 total out of your $15. The restaurant then charges $4.75 to the people who order a hamburger (you get an extra dollar) and $3.75 to the people whose order includes fries (you get an extra cent). You then pay $2 to the waitress who brought you your fries. Therefore, the bill totals $12.75 or $3.75 less than you would normally pay. The extra cent is deducted from your total. Therefore if you were to make an extra payment, you would get $4.75.\nOutput: In a restaurant, 5 waitresses are trying to convince everyone to bring money to cover the bill for the people who ordered food. Each of the 5 women gets $2.50 each. Therefore, after giving the waiter the money from each of us to pay, the waiter brings us $2.50. For each remaining customer, the women give them a different bill until the bill is paid. So each of us gave the waiter $2.50 of our total. To calculate the total of money at hand, subtract $2 = $1.50 from $15 = $13.75. So our total is $12.75 minus $6 = $11.75.\nInput(s1,input()):\nInput: Three people are at a party.

Alice's costs add up to $10 * $3.50. Therefore, her costs to the bar are $10 - $3.50 = <$5>.  Therefore, her costs add up to $5 * $10 = $5 * $10.\nTherefore Alice's costs add up in to $8 * $5 * $10= $20.

Some people may only take the child to their home and do not allow any one else into the house who would be able to hurt the parent.  Because people do not plan ahead most of the time, this may vary from person to person.  The number of hours people spend thinking about where to take the baby, and who to care the the baby, depends on the relationship they are in with the person who is going to care for the child.  Some people do not spend that much time thinking of where to take the child at all.  When people in stable relationships spend a significant amount of time thinking about, and planning, where to take the baby/child, the answer can be shorter or longer than the average.\nOutput: The average time people are expected to think about and plan when it is time to take care of a child is between 30- 60 minutes, and from 5-30 days.\nOutput: The total time it is expected that people take to think about and plan the time they are to spend with their children for the duration of that time is between 3-60 minutes.\nThe total time for time people think about and plan when to take care their children is the average.\n\nInput:  A.

They hired a construction company to build a structure that will serve as an elephant house. The construction company selected four construction workers and they all did the same job. They used the same methods as in the other three cases. How many times did each worker complete the task?\nOutput: The construction company used the same four workers but they used different routes. They also used different methods for the four routes. Thus, on the fourth route the worker didn\u2019t do the same job twice.\nThe construction workers also did the same job every time. Thus, the four workers completed the task 2**2/2 times.\nThe fourth worker did the construction job 2**2^2/2 times, thus he did less work than the first three workers. In total three**2/2 = <<3**2/2 = 8**2/2.\nThe total hours their work took was 8*2/2 = <<8*2/2=24>>24 hours. So they only put in 2/2*2/2 = 2/2/2 = 2 hour each.

{"text": "Tell Story was a 1 man show. It was a one man show that required 1 actor, 1 director, 1 script writer, 1 sound man, one visual mixer, 1 camera operator and 1 sound technician\nAfter 1 man showed the show the other men were not very impressed. So they didn't believe that they really could have a 1 man show. After about 60 minuets of showing they found another actor, a 2nd director, another script writer, a 3rd sound man, 2nd visual mixer and the same sound technician. But it still wasn't what they thought they were doing. They figured out a way to do a 2 man show of the same show. Now, the play had two parts.\nThe first part was that the actor 1 was speaking and the other actors 2 and 3 followed him and acted out parts in the first half of the show. But when the 2nd half started, the actor 2 was told that the other actors 2 and 4 didn't have a part for half of the show. So they weren't asked to act out the half they would have been in and they were unable to speak. So they sat on the sidelines of the second part and acted it out with words and words alone.\nWhen the other actors 2 and 12 were told that if they didn't act out any of their parts in the show they would be out of the show. So the 2 people from the 3rd set and this 2nd actor came in stage right and acted out the half of the show where there were 2 players acting. Now they didn't take credit for it or anything like that. They just showed up and did their thing.\nThe second part of their show was the second half of the one man show. This time the actors acted out most of the second part and this other 2nd actor did some lines on the side. They didn't take credit for anything.\nHowever, every time the audience yelled for another player, the other 2nd actor came on and played his lines of dialogue that he had written while the other actors 1 and 3 didn't get a part for more lines in the 2nd part of the show. So after about 45 minuets of the 1 man show, the audience yelled for another actor. The 2nd actor's part was filled by the first 1 actor's lines the first time that the audience yelled out for an actor (they yelled out for an actor's part the first time that the stagehands could be seen from the back.)\nWhile they were", "answer": "C: take center stage"}

If no one else bids, the farmer will sell to the estate firm for $10,000.  At the same time, he will also buy 50 kilos of apples for $3.  The value of the apples is to be split equally between the farmer and the estate firm.  How much will the two farms make from produce?\nInput: If there are 10,000 kilograms of the potatoes produced and they are sold at a cost of $10 each, then the value of the potatoes to the farmer is $900. The value of the apples to the firm is $300, and the value of the apples to herself is $500.\nOutput: The total amount of produce made from the farm is $600.  The total amount the farmer will get from the sale of the potatoes and the apples is $450.  The total amount gained from the sale of the fruits and vegetables to the estate firm is $450.\nSo the final amount gained by the farmer is $450.\n\nInput: How many calories do you burn doing body weight exercises at the gym 4 times a week?  Each of the exercises is done over 6 sets.  How many calories would you have to eat over a day to match the number of calories you burn in a workout of that duration?\nOutput: You would need to eat about 2,100 calories over a day and use up about 1,800 calories in order to match the amount of calories you burn from a workout in a day of that duration\nSo the total calories burned in a workout of that length is about 2,100\nThat means you burn about 15 calories less than you would without the exercise.  So you need to eat about 2/3 fewer calories to burn the amount of calories you would have burned otherwise.\nOutput: The amount of calories you need to burn to get the exercise is 2,100/3 = 760 calories\nSo the total amount of calories burnt in this workout is 760\nThat means you need to eat about 760/3 **760/3 = 760 calories over a 24 hour period.  So you need a total of 1020 calories over a day and 1020 calories in the 24 hours", "answer": "A: early morning"}

At the coffeehouse, each 5 people in each class took an hour long class.  The total of students at all 5 classes was 20.  Add in the 12 students total the first day and you have 60 students total for the day.  So the total number of people in all classes was 6.

For each player, there is a different number of dice, and each die rolls 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 140, 200 points. They roll their dice for 100 times, at random. How many rolls per second does the game last over 10 minutes?\nOutput: B\nIn this example, every player rolls 100 times. In ten minutes, each player has been dealt 50 dice. If each player would have the same amount of dice to deal at the same rate as in the first example, they would deal the same number of dice every time. Thus, a player would be dealt at a random rate every minute.\nTherefore, it doesn't take 10+10+3*100*250*600 = 1000 minutes for a player to have played 100 rolls in the game.\nIt takes 10+10*3*100*250 = 1000*100 minutes for a player to roll 100 dice.\nTherefore, the time it takes to play 100 dice is 2000+3000 + 1000*250 = 10000 seconds per player\nSo the time it takes for player to see the same number of dice as a player in the first example is 11*1100 + 1000*250 = 1320 seconds\n\nInput: There are 8 blackberries and 8 red berries in a row at the grocery store.

Each of the two bananas fell out with the center of the bag still on the other side of the street. How many bananas do you think fell out on purpose?\nOutput: If three balls hit together, each of them dropped three bananas. If four balls hit together, each hit four bananas. If five balls hit together, each hits five bananas. So it's difficult.\nIt's difficult.  If four balls hit together and six balls hit together, each drop 6 bananas. If five balls dropped from overhead and hit the bags, each drop 4 bananas.\nIt's difficult but there is no right answer.\nIt's difficult because if you look at two balls hitting together then every other falling ball will fall out. So it makes it difficult and each of the falling balls has to have been caused by the first ball, so the total times the bags were dropped is 4+.\nThat is a 100% answer to the problem because if each ball falls three times from the air then it is impossible to get four bananas no matter how long it takes each time.\n\nInput: 4 bananas weighing 8 tons fell out of a sack of bananas.

He carries on walking at the rate of one step per second. How fast does his gait reach point B?  Output: The speed of a gait (or other physical movement, such as walking) is often expressed in terms of steps per second.\nOutput: Since his gait reached point B at a speed proportional to his speed (1 steps per second), his gait reached point A at a rate proportional to his speed ( 1*2*10^60)\nThat is why the speed of a gait is always expressed by 1*2*10>0\nTo illustrate, assume that if you went from A to B in one second, then one step would take you 6 steps per second. The speed of a gourd when flying at 300 feet is 10 feet per second. At that speed, a gait would take 600 steps from A to B. You know that if you travel 10 feet during that 5 second trip, then the speed of your gait during that 5 seconds is 600/(1&+2)*10=300. To put that into context, a 20 minute walk, such as one from work to home, would take 600/(2&+2)*10 = 25 minutes.\nYou could also measure the speed of a gourds ascent by counting the number", "answer": "A: residential neighborhood"}

Where would he buy the remaining 4 pounds?  What is the price per pound for those 4 pounds that John is buying?\nOutput: Where can you buy meat? 4 pounds of meat is not worth a whole pound. So where can you buy the meat? Only a whole store can carry a whole whole store's worth of meat. So it's a 4-pound piece of meat. It's only worth a pound, per pound.

{"text": "The average annual salary for an executive in America is $280,000 dollars. Assuming each person can only take a vacation once a year, how much vacation would they need to take to earn that much money?\n\nInput: If a woman has 2 children, how many hours can she get of work for each day?\nOutput: If a woman has 10 children, how many hours each day can she get of work?\n\nInput: How many blocks of stone can you fit in an hour?\nOutput: The amount of stones it takes you to fill a truck with 600 is 2*600 = 5*600 = 15*600 = 150*600 = 300*600.\nOutput: The amount required to fill the truck with 600 stone is 2*600 = 10*600 = 300*200*150 = 200*600.\nThis means if you take a vacation then there is 300*600 * 150* 300 = 300*600 hours of work that needs to be done before you return to the job.  So you can now see how much time a vacation saves.  So for all the questions in this lesson, a vacation saves 3/300*300 = 48.56 hours over a year, but saves only 12/300*300 = 54.4 hours over a year if you have a job.\nOutput: The average time a person puts into a week is 60 hours. So we can now calculate the amount that you need to be working in order to earn as much as a vacation.  If the person spends 60 hours doing work per week, the total amount of hours she needs to work before she is back on the job is 6000*120 = 6000*144= 18.1 hours.  So the average person is off on a vacation 1/18.1 * 60 = 9.84 hours.  Of that 9.84 hours, 1 hour is spent eating sleep, 6 hours are spent sleeping, 2 hours are spent reading, and 2 hours is spent doing other house things.  You see how vacations work.\nOutput: To work a week, the typical person would need 60 hours over 12 weeks. Because the average person can only take a single vacation between the ages of 12-18, she will need 12*60 * 9.84 hours.\nThis means a typical person will need to spend 12*60 * 18.1 = 18.4 hours per day at the job, or 36.4 hours per week working without a vacation.

What is his overall spending?\nOutput:His total spending is $100.00 * 4 * 100.00 = $200.00.\nThe total amount he has to spend to get the drinks and food for the open bar is $200.00.  He cannot drink and be completely sober.  How much must he spend to get clean, in all, or he cannot get clean.\nIn all he must spend $200.00 not to get drunk but not to get high.\nSo his total spent is $200 and his daily spending is $200 + $200*200.00 = $1,400.00.\nSo he must spend $1,400 more each day than to get drunk not to get high.

What happened on the road was worth $250?\nOutput: The price to insure the car after the crash was $2000, that is twice the replacement cost.\nThat is a $300 value, half the replacement cost\nThat is not half the replacement value\nThere are two components in $250, price and replacement value, so therefore the value of $250 is\n$1000/2 = $1460\nIt is 1.2 times $250\nThat means the value of $250 was $1460\nThat is the total worth of $250, not including the original value of $240.\nSo the final value of $250 is $260\n\nInput: A man is playing tennis and he hits a tennis ball into an open space with an equal bounce on both sides.

If their opponent is equal, his goal tally is calculated to be 2/3 of the opponents tally, and if an opponent is equal to him, his tally becomes 10/33. If his team scores more goals than his opponent's team, his goal tally is counted as 2/3 of his team's tally. If his team scores fewer goals than his opponent's, then his goal tally is counted 1/3 of his team\u2019s tally. If his team leads by 2 goals at the half his tally is counted 2/3 of his opponents and if his team leads by 2+1 goals at the half his goal tally is counted 4/3 of his opponents. If his team leads 3 goals and one goal each at the half, his tally is counting 4/3 of his opponent\u2019s. If his team leads 4 goals and none at the half, his total tally is counting 5/3 of his opponent's. If he leads 2 goals and none at the end of the game, his total tally is counted 5/3 of his other team's. If he scores more goals than their team, he scores 5/5 of their tally. If his team is scoring more goals than theirs, that number is counted 5/5 of their team\u2019s.\nInput: 2 or more people on your team score more goals than they lose, your opponent\u2019s team scores less than they win, and you score more than they lose.

{"text": "The razor would be stored in the pocket of the person most likely to use it during the day.  He would also keep the razor at home when he does not need it and also use a disposable.  In order to save as much room as possible, the person storing both would keep the razor in a bag with a zipper on it.\nOutput: The number of times a double edge razor is needed in a year could last a person 2 years.  It would not be used more than once in that time.  So the number of times it is needed each year was 2.\nOnce the storage bag is full, the razor would be washed once each season.  That would mean it would not need to be used more than once one year.  So in order to maintain the number of times it was needed each year of 2, it would only need to be used a minimum of 2 weeks and once a season during this period.  If the storage space is not an issue than the shaving kit could be kept in the shower.  It would help to keep the space more tidy if it was kept in the bathroom.  Since it would be in the bathroom it has the benefit of being one step closer to the shower.  Since it is kept in the bathroom, it should last a little while longer before needing to be washed.  So the shaving kit would most likely be kept in a drawer or box of some sort.\n\nInput:What is the cost of buying 30 pairs of shoes? If you pay $40.05, then you would end up with $1,350 in shoes.

Since the distances are expressed in miles, a walker who walks between 45 and 75 km needs to cover an additional distance of 45 - 75 to reach 35 and 55 km.  This adds up to be more than 65 km per day.  If you were to walk 60 km per day, it would add up to 90 km.

What is the position of the sun at its maximum point in the sky?\nOutput: A total eclipse will include an absence of the sun at one time. At that point, the moon's shade will block almost all light from the sun. Therefore, during that time the moon will not be visible.\nBut as the sun's shadow grows smaller, the eclipse begins to be visible. But, by this time the moon has fully passed through. Therefore, the moon can be viewed directly at maximum extent.\nDuring the time that the eclipse is only visible from the northern hemisphere, it is at its lowest point and the sun is at an angle of 43 degrees, so the sun can't even rise in the east.\nSome say that because the shadow of the moon is thinner that it stretches farther in the sky, but others claim that the moon is half full because the Earth's gravity slows the rotation of the Earth so much that the moon appears half-full.\nSome people like to think that the moon is half-full because the Earth rotates faster than the sun, resulting in the moon being tilted to one side while the sun is tilted to the other.\n\nInput:A 1,000 gram coin weighs 1 gram.

The total cost to repair the car and to buy parts and parts alone was $2500. For every additional 2 extra copies of the part, it cost $1. A total of 40 copies were needed.  How much extra did he pay to complete the sale?  Output: 15 copies were needed to repair the car and 20 copies were needed to buy parts and parts.\nAfter the repairs were completed, he still needed 20 copies\nFor each 20 copies he needed, he paid $200 for the printouts and each additional copy cost $50.  The total cost for buying 20 copies was $100.\nTo print the additional copies, he used a print shop. The final total cost for printing was $350 for each additional copy of the parts.  How much did he pay for a total of 40 extra copies of the parts? The total cost for the parts plus the repair is $600.  So John paid $600 + $50 for 20 copies.\nThe total cost for buying 10 copies of the repair parts was $400.\nIf it had been a smaller number of copies, they may have cost $150 each.\nIf he bought them online, it would be more expensive. Since it was online, it was in large part free.\nSo the final total cost paid for the repair parts was $600\n\nInput: John bought 10 books. How many books did he pay to have professionally printed?

The person wants to earn more. How much money does he or she have at the end of the year?\nOutput: If the Swede earns $15,000 at the end of a year, then he has $27,000 in the bank\nSo the Swede has $27,000 at the end the year.\nInput: The Swedish people are spending $2 billion on foodstuffs during the year. They would rather the Swedish government pay them for their consumption of foodstuffs than use its foodstuffs for their own consumption and it is cheaper to pay for the Swedes to eat less and use less foodstuffs. How much money is the government spending to buy foodstuffs?\nOutput: If they pay for the Swedes (foodstuffs) to eat less, then they save money on food and pay tax on the money they would have needed to import foodstuffs.\nThe money saved by the government by paying for the Swedes not to eat less food is then spent on more foodstuffs.\nThis is also where things get complicated. Since the Swedes must eat less foodstuffs to pay for their foodstuffs, the Swedes must make less foodstuffs.\nSince the Swedes must make fewer foodstuffs, the Swedish population must consume less foodstuffs for the government to eat less.\nThis is also how things get complicated. Since people are eating less foodstuffs, the foodstuffs that are consumed by the Swedes must be imported from other countries.\nTherefore, the importation of foodstuffs is what causes the problem.\nIf Swedish people pay for the Swedes' foodstuffs, then they can eat more foodstuffs than they paid the tax to pay for imported foodstuffs.\nSo it is preferable for the Swedish government to pay the Swedes' food costs than it is for the Swedes to take on the food costs themselves\n\nInput: What is the highest average number of students enrolled in a university in the year 2000?\nOutput: The highest average number of students in a university was 27,880 in the year 2000.\nInput", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

When he got back, his mom, sister and brother were still asleep. It was 11 pm, so he went back to bed. Freddy dreamed that his brother saw him in the pool in the dark and gave him a hug. Freddy woke up to find himself asleep in a dark hallway. It was 1 am. Freddy was afraid, and he fell asleep again. Freddy's father woke him up, and gave him a hug, making him feel better. Freddy got back to his bed to sleep, and he didn't hear his father's voice again that night.\nOutput: Freddy was awakened in the middle of the night at about 1 am, by a loud noise in the hallway.

The cards were randomly chosen.\nOutput: All cards had an answer, so this is useless.\n\nExplanation:\nThe cards are given in numerical order. The cards are not a random set so they are \"distributed\", \"given away\" at random. There is no order, so this is pointless. The people will all discover 3's, 4's, and 5's.\nSo this is a game about probability. For each card, it is \"suppose\" there is 0.0063 chance that it contains the same word. As you get a card, it is \"assume\" that the remaining 5 cards contain the same word. You can see a pattern: 1 in 5 of the cards you get are the same card. This pattern is generated by the distribution; so the answer card is the result of the number of cards you got plus the distribution, and all the other cards were a result of all the other cards. This should be simple. It is not. If you played this game with the same people and then looked at their answers, you will see how it goes wrong fast.

The particle then must travel in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the air flow. This is the same condition that is found outside in the air.\nOutput:\nSince the particle is traveling perpendicular to an air flow direction, if a particle is traveling toward the starting point, it will travel straight away from the starting point.\nSubstituting (x and y) into (a-x, y-y):\nx+y = 30\n\nTask: The particle is travelling downwards, with air coming from above at the rate of 2.5 mph. The particle is pushed forward by the wind, moving forward 2.5 mph/meter/second. As it gets closer to the start point, the wind speed begins to decrease. If the particle accelerates to 2.5 mph/metre as it gets closer to the starting point, this would have a positive effect on its travel speed.

Therefore, we calculate the time it takes for the asteroid to pass 6.9 light years from the Earth: 60/((6.9/60) = 3.24 hours). It takes 60 hours for a lightyear to travel. (3.24 * 60 = 8.1 seconds)\nOutput: The time it takes for the Earth to rotates is 6.9 hours, so its speed is equal to 2.6 light years.\n\nInput:One hour is equal to 30 seconds.

Therefore, an asteroid 300 days from the sun is the size of the Earth. Now, with our math, we can calculate the time it would take an asteroid to cross from the sun to the Earth using the same method that we used to calculate that the Earth was 6.9 light years away from the sun.

{"text": "He received more calls on a local dialing plan than a local cell phone calling plan, for a total cost of 10*10 = <<10*10=55>>55 cents.\nAdding the costs of calls on a call by call basis, we get 10*55 = <<55*55=10>>20 cents.\nAddressing people on local dialing plans costs 10 * 10 = 35*35 = <<35*35=50>>50 cents.\nAddressing them all year round would cost 35*50 = <<50*50=150>>150 cents.\nAddressing each call would cost 150 * 50 = 315*315 = <<315*315=375>>375 cents.\nAddressing callers would cost 375 * 125 = 750*750 = <<750*750=3000>>3000 cents.\nIn each case there is a one order of magnitude difference in charges to the people who answered the phone calling on a local dialing Plan versus callers calling on a calling plan.\nSince the average cost per call from family members to family members is <<50*50=225>>225 cents, then each additional call on a local dialing call would cost <<25*25=15>>15 cents.\nAnd since a 100 calls equates to a 100 cents per minute charge, adding in the cost for each call on a calling plan would cause Fred to spend 1,150 * 100 = 35,250 dollars.\n\nSolution Preview\n\nExpected Answer: 30\n\nSolution\nWe can easily see the relationship between the two answers. In the first example, calling relatives on local calling plans is 5 cents per minute, costing the caller 50 cents. This seems to be the fair cost of a call, so the caller will pay 35 cents a minute. And if you want to make a longer call, you have to pay 75 cents a minute. So calling family members on local calling plans is 35*10*225 = $75. So while 5*50*225 = 65 cents, 5*100* 225 = 105 cents..., a much greater value is 5*75*225 = 95 cents per 10 minutes. It's the same here. We can see this is the fair cost of calling family members on local dialing plans.

Output: There are two strategies to use to get to a limit, depending on the order in which they are checked.\nThe best strategy is to use a combination of the strategies. Let f = total checked and x = number of items left.\nIn this case, the best strategy is to check from 10 to 9 instead. So for example, if I were to check 10 items, then check the total to 9, and then check 9 again to 9, I would check to 7 and 6 instead of just checking 7\nThe problem is that sometimes I may check too much and end up having too many left in order to reach the maximum possible time (for some people this depends on how fast they check),\nWhat if I only check 7, but not 10?\nThen I should only check 7 and not 10, and so on. This way there are fewer left items to check.\nThe worst strategy is to use 2 sets of strategies at once. So check all the items from 2 to 3 and then check all of the items from 2 to 4. Thus I will have more items to check.\nWhat if I use 2 sets of strategies? I will start checking items from 1 to 6 first instead of 5 to 8. Then I start checking items from 1, 7, 11, 13, etc. In this case, the worst strategy is to use 4 sets of strategies in a row.

{"text": "Who has learned and what has been learned.\nA and B are correct\nC and D are both incorrect\nE and E are both answerables but not the same answer\n\nA very large (300-400 feet) bridge is built and put into use to cross a river flowing through the mountains. People have to walk under the bridge 5 times a day. Each time they walk under the bridge, they have to pay 35 cents for their ticket. The bridge is built to make it seem like it is easier for people to cross the river and that they don\u2019t have to walk under it. Since there are 4 trains that come through town at once, people might say these trains are going too fast. To make it seem like this, they put up a speed sign. Let\u2019s call this sign a B. The railroad (train) that is going through town takes 4 years to complete the bridge, so the speed sign says 35 cents a person. Let\u2019s also call it a D, so it took 4 years to complete the speed sign.\nThe bridge is built again (or redone) this week. People get a pass on paying 35 cents a day this week since the speed sign doesn\u2019t apply this time. Let\u2019s see \u2013 when does this have to be redone \u2013 this week? Let\u2019s call it this week too!\nThe bridge is in use for about 16 days when people hear about a man who had a heart attack and died. His family believes that there is a problem with the bridge, and they want to build the bridge differently in order to prevent this from happening again. Since the train is still going, nobody notices anything. So let\u2019s say now that the train is moving, and people are no longer watching the speed sign. So let\u2019a let\u2019s say that the new speed sign says 60 cents a person. That\u2019s a lot nicer for people to get into town. The time is now correct \u2013 16 days since the first time the bridge is used.\nIf the second time the bridge is used, the speed sign is again wrong, people won\u2019t be able to buy a ticket. The railroad is very upset that they have to spend money redoing a bridge twice in less than a year, so they decide to build the bridge differently, but this time it will be built to require a permit. Once again, they want to save money. This is the third time the bridge is", "answer": "D: learn"}

While everyone else was watching television, the two older cousins got into a fight. Each ended up saying things to the person they threw water on, such as \"you're ugly.\" Which of these answers best explain their situation as a group?\nAnswer: \"a\" and \"b\" Explanation: In a group, it's important for one person to be the bad guy when they yell at a kid at the pool, or when they call his dog the dumbest thing they've ever said. However, it isn't fair for one person to do the yelling or calling, because it'll get everyone in trouble and no one will be happy.

How can the artist commemorate that horse forever?\nTo find this money, we can go to a website where Tim keeps his change. When we do this, we find the money Tim keeps by typing in the four numbers: 5 * 75 is 5 * 125. The first number here is 75, and the second number is 125, so we can put the rest of the first number in with the second number. So, 25 multiplied by 10 is 25 * 25, and we subtract 25 / 125 = 2500. To get 2.125, we use the amount of coin to the last digit to get 2 * 100. So we subtract 2 / 100 = 2500.\nWhich number do we put here? 75. When we go to Tim's website, we find the 5 that Tim kept and give him 5 dollars. So to get the money back from Tim, we add the 2.125 together. Because 2500 is less than 50, we change 50 / 100 = 2500. Using our equation, we get 2500 / 50 = 4 * 2500 = 150.. Since we started with a grand total of 2500 dollars, it's hard to see how much money we can get from", "answer": "D: painting"}

To do so, the number had to be marked at least five times and written in black ink. The numbers had to be marked in only one place. After marking the numbers, Seth turned it over to a teacher. Seth said to the teacher, \"I can't find the correct answer.\" The teacher then told Seth, \"If you give me the right answer, you can win a prize.\" Seth agreed. So Seth started by marking the numbers on the paper twice, then again, and again, and again, so he could double-check that he wrote in the right place (first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh). Finally, Seth tried writing the answer twice in black ink to make sure he was really writing the correct answer (first, second, fourth, fifth, and seventh). After writing five different numbers in black ink (first, second, fifth, sixth, and seventh), Seth decided he had a winner. How did Seth turn out to be the winner?\nOutput: If you mark your numbers five times and write the right answer 5 times on the paper, you win a prize of 100 million dollars.\nSubtracting five numbers from first, second, fifth, and sixth, we find that Seth wrote a total of 100 million dollars. Finally, subtracting five numbers from all places, we find that Seth only wrote 5 million dollars.

The candidate responds by saying that he \"wasn't sure\" exactly what he was being accused of. After about 2 minutes, the female interviewer asks the same question and tells the candidate that the reference will be called. After about another 2 minutes, the male interviewer asks another question, this time about his personal life. After about 45 seconds, the male interviewer asks the same question to which the candidate responds that \"I haven't talked to a lot of people.\" Then, the female interviewer asks a third question, asking the candidate if he believes he has any legal rights. After another 45 seconds, the male interviewing asks another question, which asks the candidate what if he is charged or convicted.

{"text": "Here are 2 options to get seats:  A: Movie = seats B: Opera = seats C: theater = seats D: Hockey game\nUsing this information, go to the ticket booth and give 20 dollars to any seat available.\nOutput: At the box office, the cheapest seats are :  A: Opera = seats B: Movie = seats C: Theater = seats D: Hockey Game\nWhich seat is closest to the \"backrow\"? The seat with the most people? The seats behind the box or the ones farthest in front?\nOutput: At the boxes, seats B, C and D are furthest from the back. At the seats A, B and C, the seats A, B, C and D closest to the front.\nSubtract the tickets prices from each of the seats, this leaves just 1 seat: A: Boxes = (1 + price) x 100 + 100. The seat with the best price is the seat furthest from the stage or close to the entrance.\nSubtracting the cost of tickets from the prices, we get 1,100 / 100 = <1,100*100=1>100 dollars\nSubtracting 100 from $, we get 1,1000*100 = $1,000. So the seat furthest from seats A, B and D has a value of $1000. Thus, the seat closest to the entrance is A\nSubtracting price from 100 leaves us $1,600 = $1.600, for the best seat. The seats around the stage/door are not the best seats, they are closer seats. The seat closest to the stage is A.

So he does not need to worry about developing land or desert, because he will end up close to the ocean.\nAt mexico, the desert blocks the road for a mile or two, so John would have to take an alternate route.\nFor the question about united states, John may have gone the wrong way by going west, because that was his highway (Oklahoma State Highway 10).\nFor the question about the desert, maybe John had gone up an off street, or maybe took a dirt road to make his route through the desert easier.\n\nInput:John and Bob are traveling through France on route to Poland. In France, France offers to let John go to Paris for 300\u20ac (75\u20ac roundtrip). However, Bob wants John to stay in France where he can shop and eat in Paris. If John accepts the offer to go to Paris, on their return John buys Bob a plane ticket and gives Bob 300\u20ac. So how much was it?\nOutput: 300E\nAt 300E, getting to Paris on a normal plane cost Bob 25E / 25 = <<25*25E=100>>100.\nSince 25E / 100 = <<25*25e=100>>100, Bob paid 100E / 125 = <<95*95E=125>>125 cents.\nAdding the flight cost to the price of the package in France and the package in Paris, we get >95E / 150 = <<95*95e=150>>150 cents.\nSince France offers to pay 300E, Bob paid 150E / 75 = <<75*75E=75>>75 cents, for an equal package. So John paid 75E / 75 = <<125*125E=125>>125 pennies.\nSo the answer is 75E, and the answer is correct. So the final answer is 75E\n\nInput: John and Bob have 60 euros each. John makes a decision about whether or not to spend that money on a meal out. Bob decides not to spend the money and passes it onto John. John spends the money anyway and adds another 60 euros that he didn't spend on a meal out to Bob's balance.

There is no \"waxing appointment\" here for the grooming to be cancelled. There is a \"shampooing appointment\", where the hair will still need to be shampooed. This is a much more personal appointment, as the groom probably wants to show his own beauty too. So here, A+, the grooming will most likely continue.\n\nIn C), if he was trying to get a \"later\" appointment, and failed, then the grooming will have to proceed, unless the groom needs to get the haircut right away. In C), this option can be taken, and a hairstylist will show up later, usually after another client has turned up.\n\nThe answer is C) the hairstylist shows up later (after the next client turns up), and it is done this way for all the appointments. The client is actually supposed to do this anyway, as he is not responsible for the actual hair styling (or any other appointment) of any other client (other than the one he had cancelled or rescheduled already).\n\nIf someone is cancelling multiple appointments at the same time for some reason (like if I have to take a long lunch before I could take a client to the salon), then yes, the hairstylist can be the first one called (unless it is an emergency, in which case, another stylist might be called).

Each pair has two sentences, one in one line and one in the other. The sentences should all contain at least one word, or each word must be a part of both. Use all the words in each sentence to make the paragraph.\n(B, C, D, E) is 10\nB = 6\nC = 0\nD = 7\nE = 0   = 5\nSuppose B and E are two different words. How do you combine them to make the other sentences work?\n\nInput:Which color is less orange and less green? Write the answers in pairs; you can count them separately.\nOutput: 10/7 = 12\nSo each of the five answers is between two and five letters off. That works out to be 8/7, 10/7, 12/7, 6/7, and/or 7/7.\nEach of the four sentences contains up to four words; you can count them individually if you need to. But the 4th sentence is the shortest. So that should be counted as the 5th word and should be added to the list. And since there aren't enough words in it, the 6th word is excluded\nThe first sentence has 10 letters, and the last sentence has 12. The average of 10 / 12 is 8/12. So you get a total of 40/12 = 40/42 = 40.\nNow that the total is 40/42 = 20/44 = 20, the sum of the numbers between 2 and 20 is 30, and the sum between 2 and 10 is 20. So the total of these numbers is 20.\nAnd the answers for the 5 questions are 20/44 = 16/72 = 16, 16/72 = 10/16 = 15, and 16/72 = 8/10 = 8.

Randy will go out on the balcony and walk around taking photos, and then return to the room and take his seat in the living room. Randy will have 9*3=24 minutes to eat each pint of ice cream, leaving 2 and 5 minutes for the two dishes of ice cream. How many minutes will the ice cream take on Randy's balcony?\nOutput: This question is about the number of minutes it will take Randy to eat the ice cream at his balcony. To find the answer, we take the time it takes him to eat each ice cream pint at the balcony, and divide this number by 4 (1/4) in order to get minutes instead. The answer is: 6 minutes.

Output: Let x = the number of pairs in each pairing.\nOutput: Let y = the average number of pairs in each leg.\nLet (x + 1) = x + x + y + 2. Then we get x = 60\nThis means that one pair has 60 legs\nSubtracting y from x yields: 50\nSo that means that both women have 30 legs.\nSubtracting x from y yields: 18\nThe total number of legs of each pair is 30 x 18 = 150\nSubtracting 18 from x yields: 9.5\nThe total number of pairs of legs in both legs is 150 x 9.5 = 400\nThis means the total number of legs in each pair is 600\nSummarizing, we get (600/150 = 450) = 450, the average number of legs in pairs.\n\nInput:Two people work in the kitchen.

What will the man have to do to give them the freedom to live together? A: He will buy them alcohol B: He will make them his concubines C: He will make them prostitutes D: He will throw away the liquor bottles he bought for them\nOutput: His total household costs will be 45 + 22 * 55 = 55, and his salary is 55 * 55 = 100. So his household cost will be 40 + 20 + 55 + 100 = 140 and his total salary will be 110 + 70 + 70 + 110 = 260.\nSo his household will be 43, his salary will be 110, and his total income will be 255.\nSo his household has 45, his salary has 110, and his total family income is 255.\nSo one of them has to be under 25 years old and is married, but both of them must live with the other one above the age of 25, and he has to buy them alcohol.\nSo one of his wives has to be under 25 and is not married. And the other one has to be at least 25 years old and is not married. In order for them, to live together, both have to be at least 25. So one wife has to be under 25, and she has to be at least 28 years old.\nIn order for him to buy them alcohol, one of his concubines has to be at least 16 years old and is not a wife. Another has to be 16 years old. But they must be married or have a marriage contract.

If they do a circuit around the house from front to back without stopping, they will be heading toward the back. To avoid this they have to walk toward the front door. So, the correct answer is: A.\nOutput: Walking toward the front door means walking out your front door. Walking around the house from front and back means going to the front door and then going back to the back.

If you count letters after each letter, you will get a number. If you add each letter of each word, as long as there are no gaps, you will get a letter to add. Then divide each letter by its frequency to get a number.\nOutput: If 10 is the total then 25-10=100. Then 3+100=175. So 10 - 3=75. Then 2+175=125. So 70+125=225\n\nInput:In the USA, the minimum wage is $7.25 hour. At a hotel in New York, there is a total bill that exceeds $15,000.00. Who is the person that paid all of that?

So if you count the total, you will get t = [(t + 2t)^(2+t^2)]\nOutput: If 100 is the total then 15 -(100-100) = 105. Then 5+35=175. So 35 - 3=50. So you know that the total was 105.

{"text": "Decreasing wages, increasing the supply of goods, and increased unemployment would cause inflation. Wage stagnation, which is common under inflationary conditions, leads to increased unemployment. It causes the cost of goods to be higher, which is directly noticeable. Also, wage stagnation causes increases in consumption, further increasing inflation. Because of its effects, wage stagnation is sometimes referred to as the \"hidden hand of inflation\".\n\nInput: What is the average amount of money people in a society have to spend?

G: How many dollars is spend on goods and services each month? (Each answer can be a multiple choice question)\nOutput: Inflation is the amount of money you would expect to pay to buy goods and services. Deflation is the amount of money available to you. The more cash people have, the more available it is to buy goods and services and the cheaper prices are.\nOutput: Since inflation is more than deflation, deflation is always worse\nOutput: If everyone has the same amount of money, price increases do not occur automatically, and prices must increase to keep pace. When more money is available to buy goods, goods are more expensive\nOutput: Since inflation only happens occasionally, people are more willing to accept price increases. Price increases are most likely when there is a shortage of currency or there is more need than supply. When there is a shortage of goods, prices are probably the highest they have ever been and are always expensive. When more goods are available, the prices will be lower.\nOutput: When inflation is rising dramatically, people may be afraid that they will be poorer than they were before. People are more willing to accept low paying jobs to improve their own health because they are not worried that there will no longer be a job available for them.\nOutput: In some countries, people may be willing to accept lower paying jobs for better health. When the cost of goods and services rises quickly, people who cannot afford their food may eat bread and soup to stay alive. When people can not afford bread or soup, they may stop eating altogether.\nOutput: If there is a shortage of money and everyone has the same amount, then prices are going down\nOutput: When there is a shortage, people will not pay so much because they feel they are more desperate than they really are.\nOutput: People who accept a raise in", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

{"text": "Find the shortest path from the human to the water.\nInput: Which is the shortest path from either A or B to the water? Output: A = D * E\nThe distance D + E from B to A is 5*5*5 = 250\nSo, the shortest route from the human to the place he sits is B * E = 250\nLet's look at the different ways to reach the human from A. If the human walks, the road goes straight from A to B. Therefore, if the human walks towards A, he has to walk five and a half miles, 5.5 miles to reach the path he needs. We have already explored the concept of walking at a constant pace of four miles, so let's look at the next shortest way a human could find to reach B. If the human goes left, then he has to walk three miles, taking a left turn of 6.5 miles, just to reach a bridge from which he can walk another four or five miles to reach B. The shortest route from B to the bridge is B left. So to reach the bridge he must walk 15.6 miles in that direction. However, if the human decides to go right, then he can go two straight miles and a straight turn, just to reach the same place and not have to walk 15.6 miles back. The shortest route from A to B is B right. This route requires less walking because the human doesn't have to look both ways twice. The shortest route from one street to the other is Y = Y + U. Then U + (Y * (Y + U))) = U + [Y * (Y + (Y + U))) / (Y + (Y * U)))\nThe shortest route to the bridge is E left. So to reach E left, he would have to walk a total of 18.6 miles, taking E north and then south for two miles on either side, to reach the spot he needs to be.\n\nInput:We can choose between two pairs of words.

{"text": "You will have a big ass brain in 12 months\n\nThis week's topic can be defined quite simply.\nToday, we have to look at the number 7 and think of what it can represent. 7 can represent the concept of a number, a number of factors being the same number, a number of components being the same number, or a specific number. Let's look at these examples using 7.\n\nIn the following discussion, it is important to understand what the 7 is to get the answer. In the examples we will discuss, we assume that we have access to knowledge. Knowledge doesn't have to be physical knowledge. Any and all knowledge we have, including those we don't have, could be understood through this concept. In this case, we have the knowledge of a number being equal to a number of factors being similar or the same. This could include any number of factors, just like we have 7's. Take an example from the example below that the student would choose themselves, and the answer is 1 + 7 + (5 - 5) = 9. Does 1 + 7 + (4 - 3) = 10 or (4 - 2) - 5 + (6 + 2) = 11? Using knowledge of a number, we can look at the two different situations to determine the answer.\n\nIn #1, we assume that the first number is the result of the fact that the second number is the same as the first number. As the second number is the result of that second number being the result of the first number, then the first number is the difference. Thus, the first number is the number of factors that are similar, and the second number is the number of factor components.\nIn #2, we assume each of the components are the result of the whole number being the same as the first unit. Thus, the whole number is the number of numbers that are similar, and each of the components are just the same number minus 1. Thus, the whole is the number of factors, and each individual component is just the sum of each of the individual totals.\n\nIn both #1 and #2, we are focusing on the fact that 7 represents a number with a relationship. 7 represents a number that can be viewed as the product of a number of factors being different. In fact, we can even say that knowledge with 7 has a form to it.\n\nThe final outcome of having 7 as knowledge with 7 is a larger brain in 12 months.", "answer": "D: growth"}

{"text": "Playing soccer 6 years ago lead to a total of 6 years, 9 months and 29 days.\n\nSolution Preview:\n\nFirst, we want to say one thing that we should have seen before now, which is that a) not everybody can do it after the age of 30 (and not everybody can have it in their first try) and b) there is no limit as what your body can do. However, all the players in the game can play all the year. By now, not everybody is young man any more. In fact, there is quite a number of old men playing soccer. That is why they put the limit only for young men.\nOn the other hand, there are many people who have never played soccer. For the example, there is an old man who is almost 90 years old. He does not even have a bicycle. In this case, he have no chance to play some time more in the game. He will never play soccer again. But, now the question in my mind is what is he going to play when he gets old. We can say that the limit is not a strict one. It is not to put a limit only for very young men. It is more a limit in terms of fitness. But, I think by now that you know that the limit was put only for young men. How do we solve these problems in order to have a complete game that everybody is able to play?\nIn order to have a game for everybody not young men, some rules are need. Actually, there are not many rules since we have not played the game ourselves. So it is a good idea to write some rules before you start playing the game.\n1) The ball has to be in a fair distance from the person who want to score.\n2) If there is a mistake with a throw, the player should try to reset the ball to his feet again before the thrower. Otherwise, it would be the ball in the opponent's net.\n3) If a goal occurs, the time for restarts will still be the same as for throws.", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

A new car dealer will give him a certain dollar amount if he would install X number of new lights around his house. Pete knows where the lights are going because he already installed them in his own house. So he asks the dealer how much it will cost him to do that. The dealer says it will be $3000. Pete replies, \"Then the car dealer asked how many dollars he wanted for the lights. He offered a bonus. Pete told him 5 thousand.\nPete wanted to give the dealer 1,000 or 5 thousand. The dealer offered Pete 1,000, so Pete agreed to give him $500. He then asked for 2,000 dollars. The dealer agreed so he asked for $3,000 as Pete was very nervous. The dealer agreed but demanded a $500 deposit. Pete agreed so Pete agreed to the deposit and the 2,000 dollars. Before closing the sale, Pete needed the money because he was due to pay a lawyer $1500 but he had less than 2,000 dollars to spare. After the sale was completed, Pete called the dealer to ask about the lights. The dealer told him that if he took the deal and installed the lights he could keep the balance.

{"text": "An easy answer. The goal is to hit a ball back to your opponent and hit a ball forward as fast and straight as possible to hit their opponent. You must make lots of revolutions and not miss the ball. Good tennis racket players can hit a ball with the same power as a ball hitting a wall for a good distance (like 100 meters). Good tennis court players can hit a ball for 60 meters and hit the ball again after a half-second without missing. Good legs players hit the ball straight with their whole body.\nExample: The tennis ball can be hit for a very fair distance (like 100 meters) with a good racket player, but hitting the ball back is much harder. The problem is the force of the bounce. If the ball bounces too high, it bounces back low and your shot goes out of play. If the ball bounces to low, it hits you on the arm or shoulder and misses the shot. Even if you hit the ball directly on the ball's hit zone, it still bounces to low or goes out of play.\nIf you are a good tennis player, you are the best for some competitions. If you are decent to excellent, you can beat any other tennis player, except for world class greats like Murray, Federer, Nadal and Djoko. If you think you are really great, you can win even world or Olympic tournaments (that's doubles play). You can also win national and world tennis championships over the years. In other words, a good tennis player can play tennis professionally and compete at a high level. A good and fair racket is usually the most important thing.\n\nInput: What is the length of a basketball with a diameter of 35 cm, a weight of 14 kg (33 lbs), a depth of 15 cm and a circumference of 20 mm? Output: x = 5 = 35 cm x 5 = 35 cm x 35 = 47 cm\nTo get the answer a player has to know the following\n1) x = 4 = the height of the ball at 35 cm\n2) x = 4 = width of the ball at 35 mm\n3) x = 40 = length of the ball at 35cm\n4) 4 = length x 5 = height\nSo at 35 cm, x = 4 is 43 cm long\n\nInput: What does the letter I represent on the first page of the Alphabet?

{"text": "There are a variety of locations for printing. The most frequent ones are school, home office and print shop. Schools are typically used in the morning and the evening. Homes are typically used on the weekends and in the summer. The most frequent place for printing, however, is also by many individuals: newspaper offices.\nThe most common paper used at newspaper offices is the notebook paper. This paper is produced using a process called printing. When the sheet of paper is cut in to the desired length, this is called a cutting. Then a laser beam scans the paper, forming the desired number of lines. After the necessary number of lines have been printed, the paper is folded and rolled up into a bundle. The bundle can then be taken to the nearest newsstand, bookseller or office supply store to buy papers and paper-related supplies.\nPrint shops are very common in many parts of the world. They provide the printing of articles such as newspapers, magazines and textbooks, and they typically charge between $10 and $20 for a single article, depending on the specific size. They offer printing from plain copies of newspapers and magazines to books with full color printing to custom-made papers, such as folders and notepaper.\nA newspaper office is a space where newspaper articles are printed. Print shops can range between large-scale operations that only print large documents, with hundreds of thousands of copies, to small-scale operations that print a number of different newspapers with as few as 10 copies per week. The most common types of newspapers that a newspaper office prints are news print from national publications, weekly publications, regional newspapers etc. However, you can also find newspapers that sell only newspapers. A newspaper office also prints copies of magazines, magazines dedicated to specific interests or topics and also some books. Newspapers are generally distributed free of charge, except when newspapers charge subscription fees.\nPaper-based advertising is a medium used to reach potential buyers. Advertisers use print and broadcast media to target specific people. Advertisers are usually able to place targeted advertisements in a newspaper because they have permission to use the paper's space. Commercials can also be placed in a newspaper based on audience demographics. The audience demographics determine the content type a newspaper is likely to print. A newspaper often prints advertisements based on the demographics.\nThe newspaper is typically made from paper produced from recycled papers. Newspapers are usually paper-based because paper is a relatively inexpensive resource that can be inexpensively recycled.

We used 50 ml liquid Ketchup (a tablespoon and salt).\nSolution: The final solution is 150 + 150 = 150 ml. For 1 tsp ketchup, using a tablespoon and 20% salt, you can't have too much, but you can still have too little.\nSolution: The correct percentage for 1 tsp liquid ketchup is 150 + 10% = 150 ml.\nSolution: The value of 1 tsp liquid ketchup depends how much you are using relative to other ingredients as well. You need less using Ketchup with less salt and ingredients as you do more with less salt and ingredients. You can also add less to ingredients like vegetables, fruit and cereal if you want to use more ketchup. This would be the appropriate amount for Ketchup.\nSolution: The amount for 1 tsp liquid ketchupp is 150 + 10% of your total diet = 1 tsp ketchup\nSolution: 10% is a good number, but you have to weigh what other ingredients you are using (how many cups of rice does it make up, how much of meat does it make up, etc.) To answer this question, we used both. The portion of calories and nutrients in your own food and the portion of calories and nutrients that comes from other foods that have a similar amount of nutrients as far as your body is concerned.

{"text": "This is what was written: >Lindy and his family live on the 2nd floor of the building.  He lives in the basement apartment above the first floor.  On New Year's Eve, a bunch of people were at the gym working out and they started getting late.  So he and his family put on their New Year's Eve outfits.  He dressed as a pirate, and his sister dressed as a snowman.  Before they left,  they said goodbye to mom, dad, and other family. >Lindy had a really good evening.\nThe equation for total New Year's Eve spent is (200 + 50) * (200 + 50) = (225* 50) * (200 * 50) = 595.\nSubtracting the total sum of the two groups, we get (5 * 50) = >10, so he spent 10 times more on New Year's Eve than on Christmas Eve\n\nInput:An apple a day keeps the doctor away.  How many apples did your mother eat last week  *  *  *   *   *\nOutput: Let x be her total apples last week.\nx + 5 = 34 apples\nSubtracting one from each side, we get x = 3 apples\nCombining like terms and fractions, we get 3 apples = 5\nDividing 3 by 2, we get.3, so she only spent.03 apples on New Year's Eve\nSo the total number of apples she ate was 34\nSo the final answer was 34\nInput:An apple every day for the next month would eat up most of her savings.  How much money would she need each day to eat and save $70  *  *  **\nOutput: Let x*50 = 65.\nx + 8 + 25 = 84 apples\nCombining like and fractions, we get 7 apples = 65 / 85\nSubtracting 9 from the two sides, we get 7 apples / 85\nAdding 11 to 2, we get 7 apples=65/86=65 cents\nFrom these two numbers, our working deduction on the answer is 65\n(65 * 85 * 65 cents) + 14 = $7.00\nSo the total number spent is $7.00\nThe final answer is 6\n\nInput:A duck is in the water when a man passes by.

{"text": "D\nD = D=2\nIf we're not being told about the subject, how should we find truth? We're only being told about the fact that a bad guy did something bad. The only way to find the truth is if we're actually told about the bad thing someone did. So it makes sense to ask \"What does it mean when this guy says ignorance is an excuse for the crime?\" What does it mean when a bad person says ignorance is an excuse?\nTo see a bad person and tell him his actions are wrong, we look at the fact that he made bad decisions. If the crimes were caused by ignorance, then this is an excuse for it. But ignorance isn't an excuse for the crimes. So we need to find out if this guy has any evidence to show he's lying, and the answer is no. He's not telling the truth. So he's lying. A lie is when someone tells a lie knowing there will be a punch in the face. A good lie is when someone tells the truth knowing they'll face a punch in the face because the truth is hard to swallow.

So a library is at least 7 times more expensive than a classroom or university class. So James should spend a significant part of his time going home and studying instead of learning.\n\nInput:  The average temperature in Chicago on Monday is 47*F. On Tuesday the average temperature is 34*F. How many degrees would it take just for the average temperature to be 51*F.\nOutput:  I believe this problem is to complex to answer in less than 20 minutes. You can write out as much as you like but it would be too long. A simpler way to do this would be to look at the chart on page 513 of my book \"How to Study.\"  If average daily temperature has been between 42*F and 46*F for the past 3 weeks, the average day temperature after 5 days should be 52*F.\nLet's assume we are on page 15 of the chart. So the actual average temperature should be 54*.9. We will average these two so 51.9 and 54*.9 = 57*F.\n\nInput:\nThe average temperature in Chicago on July 3 is 65*F.\nOn Tuesday the temperature is 55*F. How many days will it take to reach 65*F?(15)\nOutput: 15 = 65/2 = 49*F\nLet's assume we have just passed Monday's average temperature and can average all the rest of them to arrive at 65*F. This will give us a time to calculate the next highest. If we average 54*F until the end of the week, the average day temperature for the next week will be 63*F. Let's average 55*F over the past week and a half to reach the new record of 65*F.\nOutput\n65*F = 54*F + (54*F - 55*F) + (55*F - 59*F) + (54*F + 60*F) + (64*F - 67*F) = 66*F\nSo now we are at 56*F.

Assuming that they are going 20 mph, then Freddy wants to know how fast Freddy is going so they can get $75 for the toll, which he earns by driving 20 mph faster than the posted speed limit. Freddy is driving 10 mph over the speed limit, so he gets $75 for driving 10 mph faster than the posted limit. Freddy and his sister take out one piece of cake on the way home. If they take out 2 pieces, then the total won't be $75. If they take both, then the total won\u2019t be $35.

With the capital it has, it can invest wisely and try to make money.\nIf it did make money, then it could pay its employees a fairly decent wage and they could buy good food.

However, he/she probably wouldn't sell his/her stock for that much money, because he/she would see that it was still a loss, because if it loses money, it will go down in price.\nIf it did loose money then the loss (income and expenses) would go down.

If one lands on the ground, does it get the same amount of food as if its thrown over a hill?\nOutput: Do you get the same amount of nutrition from eating a banana as you did from throwing it?\n\nInput:\nA cat has five kittens. The first kitten runs away and the second kitten runs away. When the second kitten runs away the second kitten's mother is very angry as she knows that the first kitten ran away and now she cannot get a hold on the first kitten. If the second kitten runs away three times the first kitten runs away twice as fast making it more important that the second kitten runs away than the first. Also as a male he must keep it up with the first. He runs in circles around the first, but all the other males are running around the second kitten who is very confused. At the end he runs around the first kitten again but he is not as fast as the second kitten so he does not get away. If the second kitten was more interested in the first then the other three would run from him. If the second kitten didn't run as fast as the other two and still caught them the mother would still be very upset and run after him. Because this mother has her son by the tail and is worried about him and is very angry at him. Since they run faster then the other two she won't give them any food or anything. It is obvious that the second kitten is doing something more then this mother wants him to do. If the other two animals got along with the second kitten she would be happy. If they were to run away she would make them run back so that they wouldn't get eaten.\nOutput: As the female is more willing to eat out of the others mouths than the males she must be more interested in the second kitten.\n\nInput:What does it represent if you add four and then add a fifth finger?

He stops at a stop sign to take a picture of his license plate at night. With the light off, he takes his phone up to his face and turns it on (without touching the phone), while he is speaking his license plate out loud. Then he calls home and tells his mom what just happened.\nNow, we know that he is talking to his mom, but what happens if he is texting on the phone and doesn't answer the phone? How do we know whether or not the text is being spoken?\nOutput:Let z = a number representing the position Freddy is at on the screen when he says his license plate out loud on his phone. z = 25\nOutput:As his license plate is said out loud on his phone, we should see z increase.\nBut how would you know whether the license plate has been said out loud in text?\nInput:When Freddy is driving along the highway and he comes across a sign for a restaurant, he turns his car to go straight to the restaurant even though the car is clearly going straight. Freddy says his license plate on the phone is \"GUTS,\" which would make sense since G is the letter and T is the number after S. However, this is not a response to the sign -- it is his real license plate. If Freddy's parents answered his phone at home and he was using a text message, Freddy would have told them that he texted \"GUTS\" to the restaurant, which they would see as a signal to answer him at home. But since Freddy told his mom he didn't respond to the restaurant sign, then we can only assume Freddy was not texting, rather, he was driving to a restaurant at night.\nOutput: Freddy is driving along the highways and he stops at a restaurant that is located along the road that it is not in his best interest to be driving.

C = the set of all ideas corresponding to statements that are in the form A +  B +  C.\n\nAnalogous to the case of a verb, the subject of a sentence can be an object.  This makes a sentence of verb form:\n\"Dora wants to go to the zoo.\"\n\nHowever, we can also express the sentence in verb form:\n\"If her friends call her Dora, she doesn't like it.\"\n\nIn this form, we use the following rule:\n\"If A + B / \u221a a is the subject of the sentence, then A is also part of the sentence.\"\n\nTo see the differences between the two forms:\n\"Dora and her friends like going to the zoo.\"\n\"But if she is called *Dora, she doesn't *tolerate it.\"\n\"If her friends called Dora, A won't like it.\"\n\"Since B is the objective component, that part of the sentence cannot be said to be in the verb form.\"\n\nThe analogies between A, B, and C explain each case differently.  Since the set A includes D and B, and the set C includes C, then:\n\n\"If D + B / \u221aa is the subject of the conversation, then D is also part of the conversation\"\n\"since B can also be the objective component to D, so that part of the sentence is *A* in the verb form\"\n\"That part of the sentence that starts with \"To Dora\" / \u221a A can no longer be said to be in verb form\"\n\nThe analogies with A, B, and *C show why it is important to differentiate A / C / B from a.  A / C / B refers to parts of the sentence that can be either A or B.  A / C is an object noun and can be either an object or a verb.  A / C can also be an object pronoun.

So here's the answer:\n> Titanic - (1) Titanic - (2) Titanic 1) Titanic 2) Titanic 3) Titanic 3) Titanic 2\nTitanic is not in the column to the left; Titanic is not in the same column or row as Jurassic Park; and Titanic doesn't appear anywhere on the bottom or near the end; Jurassic Park is in the leftmost position. So here's the final right answer:\n> Titanic * (4) Titanic * Jurassic Park 1) Titanic 2) Jurassic 1) Jurassic 2) Titanic 3) Jurassic 2\nTitanic gets the fourth position because there is more than one Titanic in the Top Ten, and the fourth and fifth rows would have a higher number of Titanic rows than they do other rows, resulting in the fourth row's score being higher than it would be otherwise.\nThe top three rows are empty, so there is no column for Jurassic Park or Titanic to occupy.

{"text": "What does success really mean? In what context should a family celebrating success? What is success really for?\n\nInput:There are two types of data entered into Google, HTML elements and HTML codes. These elements contain information within a webpage; while HTML codes are often used to display data within a webpage. However, the two most common uses of elements in the Web are not the same as the most common uses of codes.\nThe most common use of HTML elements for content is as a form element, which uses the <field> element to set values (for example, input fields, form content, etc.) within their scope. HTML codes are often used for form elements, in addition to their use in CSS, because many code editors allow this to be done with a single code change. However, HTML codes are most often used for display and layout. They are used most often to make a webpage appear more appealing than if it were not. The following are most common uses for HTML codes and are used most commonly: <h1>; <p>; <img>; <br />; <li>; <div>; </div>; <a id=\"fancy\"></a>; </p>; </div>\nThe second most common use is as an input element. In most common use cases, an input element is used to send data from an external source; in other words, to send an external data packet. Two common use case are to create a webpage that accepts data from an external source and display that data on the webpage (for example, a form for a data exchange (user to user exchange)) and to create a webpage that contains an external file (for example, an external text file). This can also be seen as the inclusion of external files into a webpage. The following are common uses of functions: <h1>This document is here (http://x.y.z/y.z)</h1> <p>This document is there (http://x.x.y./x.y.z).</p>; <img src=\"http://x.x/1#/2_z.i3#/3_z.i7#/4_z.i9.5\" />\n</p>; <a href=\"http://x.y/1#/x.y.z\">This web page is here X x y y z</a>;\n</div>; </div><h1", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

Output:If he plans on going to Australia next year, he should buy quality footwear or else he should buy his regular shoe.\nSubtracting, we find out that half of Frederick's salary went to buy shoes, so Fred earned 1050 / 1050 = <<1100+1000=2,000>>2000.\nSubtract the salary, from the expenditure on shoes, and we get 2,000/1000 = <<2,000/1000=10>>10 dollars.", "answer": "C: record store"}

What would you give them instead?\nOutput: Each one gets 50 cents\n\nExample: Let's say you are giving gifts to 10 children. Each child is a child. Let's assume that two children are too young to contribute money at the age of three, so we will give them five dollars instead.\nLet's also assume we got them each a small cupcake, which would be a quarter. Let's then add another cupcake for each child from ages three-five, for a total of five pieces. These presents cost 15 cents each, so the total cost is 45 cents.\nThe remaining four $5 bills were then added to that total for the purposes of the remainder.\nTotal: 1 * 15 = 55\nTherefore: 1/55 = 55 cents.\n\nInput: Let's suppose you are about to give someone a new car.

The store is better if the type of store is selling small items, like home accessories or jewelry. For example, if you're a jewelry store, you will usually sell jewelry sets -- this is one small area and may only be open for a few hours. On the other hand, if you're a grocery store, you will also sell cereal, fruit, and vegetables. So even though you buy groceries in a single location, each location will usually sell slightly different products (A) or a unique product (B). So, although individual stores sell similar products, the store in front of me sold almost the same merchandise in all four locations, and because I wasn't buying the same products, the store in the middle was the most convenient.\n\nInput: I have 6 hours to work, 7 hours of classroom lectures, and 4 hours of office time.\nOutput: 5 hours of lecture, 8 hours of office work, and 5 hours of classroom lectures.\nSince 8 hours of lecture = 5 hour total, 5 hour total = 4 hour total, and classroom lectures are 1 hour long, I divide 4 hours by 5, so classroom speeches are actually 4 hours long.\nThus total = 55 hours = 4 hour total\nSince 55 hours of office work = 2 hour total, 1 hour total = 5 hour total, I divide 5 by 4, so office work is actually 1 hour long.

At the same time he calls his brother and tells him that his family is about to come to his house. For this to work, Freddy has to get enough money. How much should he ask his parents for?\nAnswer: Lets take the following equation: 2x + 8*(-8)*(-8)*(-8)/2 = 58 * (-56)/(((-8)/(-8))*8)/2\nSubdivide this into 58 and divide 58 * 56/(((-28)/(8)*(-8))*28) = 57 * 8/(((-8/(8))/(8))) = 58 * 56.\nSubstitute 58/56*8/(((-8)/(-4) + -8)) = 58 + 56 + 56 + 56 /((8/(-8))/(8)) = 59.\nSubstituting 59/56*8/8 /8 /8 = 57 / (8/8), we get: 1.5 x 58 / (2x + 1.5 + 1/4)/(-1) = 7.8 x 59 * 8 = 14.4 x\nSo 7.8 x 14.4 x 8/2 = 10 x 58 = 25 cents.\nNow we get the rest of the equation: 2x + 25 x 58 = 25 x 10 * 58 = 5 = 10 * 58 cents.\nSince 10 is 2 cents, Freddy's total cost is 25 cents.\nThis is the correct answer.\n\nInput:Freddie and his brother are in high school.

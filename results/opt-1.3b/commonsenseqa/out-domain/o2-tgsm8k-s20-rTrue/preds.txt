The cards were randomly chosen.<n>Output: All cards had an answer, so this is useless.<n><n>Explanation:<n>The cards are given in numerical order. The cards are not a random set so they are "distributed", "given away" at random. There is no order, so this is pointless. The people will all discover 3's, 4's, and 5's.<n>So this is a game about probability. For each card, it is "suppose" there is 0.0063 chance that it contains the same word. As you get a card, it is "assume" that the remaining 5 cards contain the same word. You can see a pattern: 1 in 5 of the cards you get are the same card. This pattern is generated by the distribution; so the answer card is the result of the number of cards you got plus the distribution, and all the other cards were a result of all the other cards. This should be simple. It is not. If you played this game with the same people and then looked at their answers, you will see how it goes wrong fast. Your guesses will always be wrong.<n><n>Example:<n>The first group of people will be:<n>A, B, C, D, E, F.<n>1. You will

The particle then must travel in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the air flow. This is the same condition that is found outside in the air.<n>Output:<n>Since the particle is traveling perpendicular to an air flow direction, if a particle is traveling toward the starting point, it will travel straight away from the starting point.<n>Substituting (x and y) into (a-x, y-y):<n>x+y = 30<n><n>Task: The particle is travelling downwards, with air coming from above at the rate of 2.5 mph. The particle is pushed forward by the wind, moving forward 2.5 mph/meter/second. As it gets closer to the start point, the wind speed begins to decrease. If the particle accelerates to 2.5 mph/metre as it gets closer to the starting point, this would have a positive effect on its travel speed. In other words, the acceleration will go to a positive value for any velocity that is higher than 0.5 m/s/second. Which of the following can be stated:<n>A. The particle accelerates to 2 mph/metre/second.<n>B. The acceleration goes to a negative value for any velocity that's 2.5 m/s faster than 0.5 m.<n>C. The acceleration goes to zero for velocity that is less than 0.5 m s/second.<n>D. The particle accelerates no faster than the ground.<n><n>Substituting a into the (a-x,y) section:<n>x+y = 42<n><n>Task: In the image above, the particle is travelling downwards. The total height of the particle is 5 meters – so it is travelling at the speed of 6 km/hour. How fast is it travelling now in the air? Subtract the answer from the answer to the question above.<n>Output:<n>Now assume the particle is travelling in a forward direction, at the speed of 0.5 m/second. After travelling for 5 meters it would reach a speed of 12 km/second.<n>Subtracting

If they traveled at a speed equal to the speed of light, wouldn't it take about 6.9 years for the asteroid to pass Earth? Therefore, we calculate the time it takes for the asteroid to pass 6.9 light years from the Earth: 60/((6.9/60) = 3.24 hours). It takes 60 hours for a lightyear to travel. (3.24 * 60 = 8.1 seconds)<n>Output: The time it takes for the Earth to rotates is 6.9 hours, so its speed is equal to 2.6 light years.<n><n>Input:One hour is equal to 30 seconds. At a speed equal to 2.6 times the speed of light, it would take an asteroid 300 days to cross the Earth. It would take an Earth-sized Asteroid 900 days to cross the earth at this speed. Therefore, an asteroid 300 days from the sun is the size of the Earth. Now, with our math, we can calculate the time it would take an asteroid to cross from the sun to the Earth using the same method that we used to calculate that the Earth was 6.9 light years away from the sun. Using the same calculations, it would take an Asteroid from the sun to the earth at a speed equal or less than 2.6 times the sun's speed. Finally, if

In the first example, calling relatives on local calling plans is 5 cents per minute, costing the caller 50 cents. This seems to be the fair cost of a call, so the caller will pay 35 cents a minute. And if you want to make a longer call, you have to pay 75 cents a minute. So calling family members on local calling plans is 35*10*225 = $75. So while 5*50*225 = 65 cents, 5*100* 225 = 105 cents..., a much greater value is 5*75*225 = 95 cents per 10 minutes. It's the same here. We can see this is the fair cost of calling family members on local dialing plans. So the most reasonable thing to do is...(I would answer his or her question with one or more of these questions or answers...)<n>To get additional information or to help you answer some of your own questions:<n>1.

Each of the students is given a maximum of 10 items, however they do not receive anything at 10 item limit. What is the best strategy to use to get to the maximum possible time on the computers? Output: There are two strategies to use to get to a limit, depending on the order in which they are checked.<n>The best strategy is to use a combination of the strategies. Let f = total checked and x = number of items left.<n>In this case, the best strategy is to check from 10 to 9 instead. So for example, if I were to check 10 items, then check the total to 9, and then check 9 again to 9, I would check to 7 and 6 instead of just checking 7<n>The problem is that sometimes I may check too much and end up having too many left in order to reach the maximum possible time (for some people this depends on how fast they check),<n>What if I only check 7, but not 10?<n>Then I should only check 7 and not 10, and so on. This way there are fewer left items to check.<n>The worst strategy is to use 2 sets of strategies at once. So check all the items from 2 to 3 and then check all of the items from 2 to 4. Thus I will have more items to check.<n>What if I use 2 sets of strategies? I will start checking items from 1 to 6 first instead of 5 to 8. Then I start checking items from 1, 7, 11, 13, etc. In this case, the worst strategy is to use 4 sets of strategies in a row. So check the items from 1 to 6 then the items from 6 to 7, then the items from 7 to 8, then 8 to 9, the items from 9 to 10.<n>What if you use 0 sets of strategies?<n>Then the worst case scenario

The player has 20 balls to hold. The player is playing a round. Each ball is worth 4 points (3 points to each player).<n>Output: If the ball does not hit the bottom of the screen, you lose one point. If the ball hits two different spots on the bottom of the screen - that means you won a point.<n>The game begins if the ball does not collide with anything or touches the bottom, and proceeds until there is a collision. Then, it ends.<n>In this case, the first ball in the game - to be called the "ball", moves over two spots near the bottom of the screen.<n>The final number of points is thus: 20 - (8 + 4) = 20<n><n>Input: The player has 16 candies and 2 potions. Each potion is worth 2 (2 candies). A potion with half a candy and a potion with 1.5 candies is worth 5 potions. If the player drinks the potions (the potions must be consumed) to make his candy bar full, his total candies will be 10.<n>The player goes up in difficulty and has to start the game on harder difficulty for each victory. If the player loses, he can drink more potion to become full or add candies to restore candies for the next round.<n>The player has to get up first. That means that he has to stop where he is (after he stops drinking for 6 seconds or more). He has to get up with two candies at least, but he cannot drink more than 5 potions per game (if he drinks more than 5 potions, he loses a point). However, he can lose potions and not get back his candies. At the end of the game, that is shown on the screen. If the player is caught by enemies, his candies have to be restored.<n>The game ends when there is a total loss of candies. There is no way to win except by drinking potions. The game continues until the player reaches the final level. If the player is killed, he cannot get back his candies and the player's "bar" is empty.<n>The game ends if the player has 1 or more potions left in his bar (when there are no potions left, it shows a white screen with only a ball as the character). The game ends at the first level if there is no bar at all

Choices:  A: kick the bucket B: mortal C: dead D: can die E: dying<n>Output:		 Someone lacking immortality will one day die<n>Let's suppose the person who lacks immortality is named Choji. In the first sentence, we said the person lacking immortality is a being, that's a person. So it makes sense if we said the person lacking immortality is a being, which is a person. In the first sentence you say this person lack immortality. It's a person lacking immortality.<n>Let's suppose the other person is named Choji as well. In the second sentence, we say the person lacking immortality is not of the above kind, which is a dead person, a person that has died, a person that cannot die. So it doesn't make sense if we said an immortal. You said he will one day die. It would make sense if we said to the being with immortality.<n>Let's say in the second sentence, the being lacks immortality doesn't understand this person, as he/she is a person lacking immortality. So it won't even be able to understand what's the person lacking immortality, and this means that the being lacks immortality.<n>So in the first sentence, the saying of someone lacking immortality would said someone with immortality, and in the second sentence said someone lacking immortality. So it looks like, someone with immortality is not an immortal. So let's change the first sentence to this:<n>The person lacking immortality will one day come to know that his/her parents are not alive.<n><n>Input: Let j = the square root of the term p and let N be the square root of N^p. What is j?<n>Output: Let N = j^p and find the answer to the riddle:<n>If you answer correctly, your name will be inscribed in stone on a mountain somewhere in Japan.<n>If you aren't able to answer, your name will be sealed inside the stone. The stone will be sealed in a cave somewhere and no one will ever be able to open the cave door. That person will be called:<n>Pagan<n>In the first sentence, someone says she will become Pagan. What does the riddle mean? Since it says that the person lacking immortality will some day come to know that her parents have died, it makes sense if we say the person who has died is one of the three kinds mentioned in the riddle, Pagan, Mortal and Dying. But since Pagan is dead already, it makes no sense if we say Pagan is having the riddle for future use. So in the second sentence it makes sense if we change the

If we add the first digit +3 which gives us a +15 so that gives us 23 which gives us 24 to 29. So we have 23 + 3 and 24 + 3 which gives us 29 to 42.<n>Combining like term give us 2 + 4 giving us 9 we get 2 * 4 giving us 4 which gives us 24. We add 2

People have to walk under the bridge 5 times a day. Each time they walk under the bridge, they have to pay 35 cents for their ticket. The bridge is built to make it seem like it is easier for people to cross the river and that they don’t have to walk under it. Since there are 4 trains that come through town at once, people might say these trains are going too fast. To make it seem like this, they put up a speed sign. Let’s call this sign a B. The railroad (train) that is going through town takes 4 years to complete the bridge, so the speed sign says 35 cents a person. Let’s also call it a D, so it took 4 years to complete the speed sign.<n>The bridge is built again (or redone) this week. People get a pass on paying 35 cents a day this week since the speed sign doesn’t apply this time. Let’s see – when does this have to be redone – this week? Let’s call it this week too!<n>The bridge is in use for about 16 days when people hear about a man who had a heart attack and died. His family believes that there is a problem with the bridge, and they want to build the bridge differently in order to prevent this from happening again. Since the train is still going, nobody notices anything. So let’s say now that the train is moving, and people are no longer watching the speed sign. So let’a let’s say that the new speed sign says 60 cents a person. That’s a lot nicer for people to get into town. The time is now correct – 16 days since the first time the bridge is used.<n>If the second time the bridge is used, the speed sign is again wrong, people won’t be able to buy a ticket. The railroad is very upset that they have to spend money redoing a bridge twice in less than a year, so they decide to build the bridge differently, but this time it will be built to require a permit. Once again, they want to save money. This is the third time the bridge is

Choices:  A: bite B: lie down C: keep alive D: need to eat E: go to sleep<n>Output:		 After listening to a story with the boy, he was tired out and so he asked his cat, a black cat, to fall asleep. After a while, the cat fell asleep. Then he said, "What would you do if you were a cat?" The cat got up and walked away. When he found himself in trouble, he said, "I would find a place to hide and go to sleep." The cat went under the bed. Then he found a wall to hide under. When the cat had enough, he said, "C'mon out of there, cat!"

How much did Kendall pay for her purchase?<n>Output: > 10 + 25 = 25 + 50 = 50<n>Combining like terms (and subtraction) we get<n>50 = 50 = 50<n>50 + 50 = 80<n>With the addition of subtraction and adding, we get<n>80 = 80<n>80 + 50 = 125<n>Combining like terms we get<n>125 = 125 x 20<n>Since the two numbers are on the same side of the decimal, we get<n>25 + 25 + 25 = 50 + 50 = 75<n>And if we use the method of multiplying the two numbers by the product of their totals (25, 5, 35, 8) we get:<n>25 = 25 + 5 + 8<n>5 + 35 = 35<n>8 + 35 + 25 = 50<n>75 = 75<n>Combining like terms makes the last digit of each the total, so our equation gets:<n>50 - 75 = 75<n>35 - 25 - 25 = 75<n>85 - 35 - 25 = 75<n>25 + 25 = 75<n>But the last digit of 75, 25, is not the same as 25, because 75 is a multiple of 25. So 50 + 75 = 125, not 100.<n>Combining like terms leaves us with:<n>75 = 75<n>75 + 25 = 125

What do both bills look like?<n>Subtract the difference in value, we get $20 and $2 = $10.  Add the two amounts, we get $10.  The figure in the $10 is $10.50, i.e. Mark spent $200.<n>Total change in cash from Bill to Mark = $150<n>Subtract $50/2 = $110<n>Total change in cash after change in bills = $50<n>Conclusion: Mark spent $200 on a candy bar; Simon spent $110.50 on a candy bar.<n>Both bills look similar.  They are both $20 bills.  However, we didn't recognize the difference in bills (Bill and Mark), and we did not recognize the change in bills (Bill – $10 + Mark – $2).<n>So the final answer was Mark spent $200 on an apple; Simon spent $110 on a candy bar.

He went to a local pet groomer, and had him groomed. Big

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Where would you find people gathered near liquid in a workplace? Choices:  A: water cooler B: opera C: hospital D: hockey game E: beach<n>Output:		 The most commonly observed group of people in a workplace is likely in a water cooler, and the majority of them live in or around Chicago.<n>The most commonly observed group of health care workers is likely in a hospital, but there are less than half a million health care workers based in the United States so we should not expect to find them.<n>The most commonly encountered group of people in a gymnasium or at a soccer game is likely in a gymnasium/soccer stadium, but there are over 300 million people who live in or around America.<n>The most commonly seen group of people at an NBA/NFL basketball game is likely in a basketball arena. It is unusual for people to assemble when there is not an NBA/NFL basketball event and the majority of people in a gym are not there to watch a basketball game.<n>The most frequently seen group of people in a baseball stadium is likely standing outside and waiting for a baseball game to start, and many people who live in or near Chicago are attending games in the suburbs.<n>The most frequently used group of people in a theater or at a concert is likely either at the front of the house or in the audience, and most people in theaters live near major metropolitan areas.<n><n>Input:If John and Kate get married but do not have children, what is the probability Kate will have fewer kids than John?<n>Output: The probability that Kate will have fewer kids is 50/10 if both John and Kate are over the age of 30 and the probability is 20/80 if only John is over 30<n><n>Output: The first 50 children of both John and Kate are the same sex, and the second 100 are the opposite sex. John and Kate start a business, ABC, which sells T-shirts and bumper stickers with "ABC" written on them. In a first week of business, ABC sells 60 shirts. How many shirts are sold per week at ABC?<n>Output: 60 == 60/100 == 100 = 12,800 per week<n>60 divided by 10 == 12,800 == 12,800/100 == 12,800*10 == 12,800/400 == 12,800<n>Output: If ABC sells 10 shirts per week, why is ABC still solvent?<n>Output: 1 == 1/100 == 2 == 0/100 == 1 = 1:12,800<n>Output: 1:12 == 1 / 100 == 2:12,800 / 100 = 2:12,600<n>Output: 1 divided by 2 == 3 / 100

How can the artist commemorate that horse forever?<n>To find this money, we can go to a website where Tim keeps his change. When we do this, we find the money Tim keeps by typing in the four numbers: 5 * 75 is 5 * 125. The first number here is 75, and the second number is 125, so we can put the rest of the first number in with the second number. So, 25 multiplied by 10 is 25 * 25, and we subtract 25 / 125 = 2500. To get 2.125, we use the amount of coin to the last digit to get 2 * 100. So we subtract 2 / 100 = 2500.<n>Which number do we put here? 75. When we go to Tim's website, we find the 5 that Tim kept and give him 5 dollars. So to get the money back from Tim, we add the 2.125 together. Because 2500 is less than 50, we change 50 / 100 = 2500. Using our equation, we get 2500 / 50 = 4 * 2500 = 150.. Since we started with a grand total of 2500 dollars, it's hard to see how much money we can get from

Seth said to the teacher, "I can't find the correct answer." The teacher then told Seth, "If you give me the right answer, you can win a prize." Seth agreed. So Seth started by marking the numbers on the paper twice, then again, and again, and again, so he could double-check that he wrote in the right place (first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh). Finally, Seth tried writing the answer twice in black ink to make sure he was really writing the correct answer (first, second, fourth, fifth, and seventh).

First, Freddy's son is a big Giants fan. Freddy thinks that the Giants got beat. Freddy starts watching the game. Suddenly, there's a big play, and the big score! Freddy is delighted. Then his grandchild wakes him up in the middle of the night and says, "You didn't watch the Superbowl!" Freddy's son looks at Freddy like he's crazy and says, "I was watching the whole thing!" Freddy is shocked, and says, "You were? That was the worst Superbowl ever!" (This is a real story, but it's a bad sports story because it implies that Freddy's son was a Giants fan.)<n>Output: At the very end of the game, when they finally get the win and the end credits come up, Freddy says to his son, "How could you not watch that game!" (Again, this is a story. It's probably not even a real story.)

In this case, the examiner does not know for sure.<n><n>Input:An interview is scheduled for Wednesday morning. This is with an individual who was scheduled for an interview on Monday afternoon. The interview is scheduled to begin at 9:00am. A female interviewer arrives at 9:15am. The interview has begun and the female interviewer asks the candidate a number of questions, one of which is about a potential criminal charge for which he was charged after his arrest. The candidate responds by saying that he "wasn't sure" exactly what he was being accused of. After about 2 minutes, the female interviewer asks the same question and tells the candidate that the reference will be called. After about another 2 minutes, the male interviewer asks another question, this time about his personal life. After about 45 seconds, the male interviewer asks the same question to which the candidate responds that "I haven't talked to a lot of people." Then, the female interviewer asks a third question, asking the candidate if he believes he has any legal rights. After another 45 seconds, the male interviewing asks another question, which asks the candidate what if he is charged or convicted. After another 45 seconds of quiet, the male interviewer asks yet another question, and repeats "what if?" until the interview ends. The interviewer then states, "the case is closed." When the interview ends, the interviewer hands the candidate a "check-in card" (or "report card"). The questionnaire answers on the card are similar to the questions on the questionnaire, except that they state no further action. The "check-in card", as described by the interviewer on the examiner's report card, is an answer sheet. It tells the interviewer, "if you are hired, please send me the application form." The answer in parentheses after the name indicates the reason the candidate was not hired. (Note: The examiners is not required by law to provide this answer sheet to candidates.)<n>Conclusion: I do not feel the examiner failed the candidate personally, but he may have failed to complete the standard portion of the test. If it is possible that this interview did not go as planned, then the examiner did not complete all the information on the report card. The examiner could not tell the candidate if the case was closed (not the case for certain charges

I was shocked at the AI's response.<n>Assignment:<n>- Select a Bible verses to represent each question.<n>- If God exists, how many of these does He choose to have?<n>- If God is real, how many does he need?(exaggerating to get the point of the question)<n><n>- John 1:10 reads:  "And the fourth angel poured out His Spirit on all the earth as a loud commandment, declaring, 'He who believes in me will not perish but have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day!'"  (The answer is 7)<n><n>- What is 5x-fold on the y-axis, x-fold on the x-axis, and y-fold on the z-axis?<n>- 3x-fold is when the y-axis and z-axis are symmetrical.<n>- 4x-fold is when they are not symmetrical<n>- 5x-fold is just equal to 0<n><n>- I don't understand how my religion can say that I will be raised in righteousness; then my religion contradicts God.  If God is real, then there is no contradiction.  If God doesn't exist, then there is no inconsistency.<n><n>- This is an easy question for an intelligent being.  If an intelligent being said that, does that mean that the person would be wrong?<n>- You would be wrong if you accepted that people are right.  You would be right if you accept that you have free will. But if you accepted that people have free will, then you would be wrong if you believed that free will is not real.<n>- Do you know that you cannot know God?<n>- Do you believe that all people live in sin?<n>- Do you know God is the most supreme being ever created?<n>- Do you even believe in God?<n>Solution: If you think that God is real, you will definitely agree that he exists. I would say that you will be right if you believe that he exists. I believe that if people have free will, they can repent of their sins and be forgiven. You can be right if you believe in free will.

So the seat furthest from seats A, B and D has a value of $1000. Thus, the seat closest to the entrance is A<n>Subtracting price from 100 leaves us $1,600 = $1.600, for the best seat. The seats around the stage/door are not the best seats, they are closer seats. The seat closest to the stage is A. So, with our information we determine that the seat A is the best choice

Only people who had done both were counted twice for this challenge. There were two days. On the day after Thanksgiving people were to work out at an aerobic gym for a half hour a day for 30 days. The first day of the cardio class was at 7:30 on November 11th, and was for endurance purposes. November 12th was the other day where 5 miles was run that didn't include any hills.  On November 14th, there was a new episode of 'The Newsroom' that would air on NBC after 7:30. This episode included a segment by John Avlon (an economics reporter that was the main reporter on the news) in which he asked people what the last year that they would give 10% back of their income to a person they were responsible for their actions, and also who that person actually was.  On that show, if you answered John Avlon's question, then you get an award that you might want to buy from the show's merch store.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:The crab was scuttling but strained when he moved, what was impeding him? Choices:  A: tide pool B: beach sand C: tidepools D: current E: cooking pot<n>Output:		A: It wasn't impeding him because the clam was scuttling under the tide pool, not out. The clam wasn't scuttling because it wanted to eat the tide pool. The clam got it wrong, it wanted to move.<n>B: It wasn't impeded because the crab was coming right at the shore and the tide pool was already on it's way out. The tide pool is far more impeded than the crab because the crab decided to take the easy option. The crab could use its strength because the tide pool was only a few feet from the shore and it would be right on top of it. The crab was impeding itself because it couldn't find the solution of the problem. It couldn't decide what to do, so it took all the things in its life and shoved them together, then tried to do something with them.<n>C: Not impeding at all. The tide pool's bottom does not lie, the clam just got it wrong. The crab's shell was never in the way of the tide pool, the tide pool was trying to escape it. It wasn't impeding itself, it was trying to escape it's situation.<n>D: Not impeding at first, the clam got it wrong when it took the easy way of escaping by scuttling straight into the current. The tide pool was impeded not just because of the crab's efforts, but because of the crabs decision, which I have already explained.<n>E: Not impeding at a time, but impeding the crabs efforts, the clams would never have scuttled away in the current, they would have just swam around the edge for a while. They were not impeding by keeping them at a distance. The clam was impeding itself and impaling itself.<n><n>Input:What would the average person eat in a three minute period?

Choices:  A: injury B: beauty C: late D: mistakes E: annoyed<n>Output:		 No<n>You can replace the word "appointment" with an appropriate word.<n><n>What happens when the grooming takes longer than you expected?<n><n>There are two alternatives presented by your friend.<n><n>In A), if he was not able to make it, the grooming will have to be cancelled due to injury (and will not be rescheduled until he is able to make the appointment).<n>In B), he will need to reschedule the appointment, or he might not be able to make it, and he would have to make it for the next week (since there is a "waxing" week). But he already knew it was going to take longer than planned.<n><n>The answer should be in A), but it should be easy to see that when I described A+) as a "waxing appointment", I was referring to either the actual appointment or the fact that it took longer than expected.<n>Here, A+, not so much. There is no "waxing appointment" here for the grooming to be cancelled. There is a "shampooing appointment", where the hair will still need to be shampooed. This is a much more personal appointment, as the groom probably wants to show his own beauty too. So here, A+, the grooming will most likely continue.<n><n>In C), if he was trying to get a "later" appointment, and failed, then the grooming will have to proceed, unless the groom needs to get the haircut right away. In C), this option can be taken, and a hairstylist will show up later, usually after another client has turned up.<n><n>The answer is C) the hairstylist shows up later (after the next client turns up), and it is done this way for all the appointments. The client is actually supposed to do this anyway, as he is not responsible for the actual hair styling (or any other appointment) of any other client (other than the one he had cancelled or rescheduled already).<n><n>If someone is cancelling multiple appointments at the same time for some reason (like if I have to take a long lunch before I could take a client to the salon), then yes, the hairstylist can be the first one called (unless it is an emergency, in which case, another stylist might be called). But if it has been an entire week since he had last been to the salon, I would strongly suggest that he calls the next stylist who is coming in his place.

How do you combine them to make the other sentences work?<n><n>Input:Which color is less orange and less green? Write the answers in pairs; you can count them separately.<n>Output: 10/7 = 12<n>So each of the five answers is between two and five letters off. That works out to be 8/7, 10/7, 12/7, 6/7, and/or 7/7.<n>Each of the four sentences contains up to four words; you can count them individually if you need to. But the 4th sentence is the shortest. So that should be counted as the 5th word and should be added to the list. And since there aren't enough words in it, the 6th word is excluded<n>The first sentence has 10 letters, and the last sentence has 12. The average of 10 / 12 is 8/12. So you get a total of 40/12 = 40/42 = 40.<n>Now that the total is 40/42 = 20/44 = 20, the sum of the numbers between 2 and 20 is 30, and the sum between 2 and 10 is 20. So the total of these numbers is 20.<n>And the answers for the 5 questions are 20/44 = 16/72 = 16, 16/72 = 10/16 = 15, and 16/72 = 8/10 = 8. So the total of the number of words in the 5 sentences after the add (3, 2, 5, or 6) is 12.<n><n>Input:Who wants to make the most money with a new job?

The first one is 45, and the second one is 22. In order for them to live together, both of them have to be over 25 years old because of the age of marriage law in his country. What will the man have to do to give them the freedom to live together? A: He will buy them alcohol B: He will make them his concubines C: He will make them prostitutes D: He will throw away the liquor bottles he bought for them<n>Output: His total household costs will be 45 + 22 * 55 = 55, and his salary is 55 * 55 = 100. So his household cost will be 40 + 20 + 55 + 100 = 140 and his total salary will be 110 + 70 + 70 + 110 = 260.<n>So his household will be 43, his salary will be 110, and his total income will be 255.<n>So his household has 45, his salary has 110, and his total family income is 255.<n>So one of them has to be under 25 years old and is married, but both of them must live with the other one above the age of 25, and he has to buy them alcohol.<n>So one of his wives has to be under 25 and is not married. And the other one has to be at least 25 years old and is not married. In order for them, to live together, both have to be at least 25. So one wife has to be under 25, and she has to be at least 28 years old.<n>In order for him to buy them alcohol, one of his concubines has to be at least 16 years old and is not a wife. Another has to be 16 years old. But they must be married or have a marriage contract. So he has three different wives.<n>In order for them, not to live under the age of 25, one of their concubines has to pay $70 * 70 + 30 = $70, and the other one has to pay $170 * 170 + 80 = $170.<n>So his household costs will be 70 * 65 + 40 = 130, and his salary will be 130 * 85 = 270.<n>So his household cost will be 130 * 35 + 20 + 80 = 220, and his salary will 280 * 95 + 100 = 470.<n>So his household contains 40 and will be under 25 and not married.

Choices:  A: play chess B: sun themselves C: wrong house D: set table E: gettable<n>Output:		 If children walk home at the end of the hall, they will be walking away from the kitchen door. If they walk to the barbed wire fence, they will leave the back door open. If they do a circuit around the house from front to back without stopping, they will be heading toward the back. To avoid this they have to walk toward the front door. So, the correct answer is: A.<n>Output: Walking toward the front door means walking out your front door. Walking around the house from front and back means going to the front door and then going back to the back. Using the same example as 1 above, if the children walked from their front kitchen door to the barbed wire they would go directly out of the door, i.e.: walking toward the front door.

G: How many dollars is spend on goods and services each month? (Each answer can be a multiple choice question)<n>Output: Inflation is the amount of money you would expect to pay to buy goods and services. Deflation is the amount of money available to you. The more cash people have, the more available it is to buy goods and services and the cheaper prices are.<n>Output: Since inflation is more than deflation, deflation is always worse<n>Output: If everyone has the same amount of money, price increases do not occur automatically, and prices must increase to keep pace. When more money is available to buy goods, goods are more expensive<n>Output: Since inflation only happens occasionally, people are more willing to accept price increases. Price increases are most likely when there is a shortage of currency or there is more need than supply. When there is a shortage of goods, prices are probably the highest they have ever been and are always expensive. When more goods are available, the prices will be lower.<n>Output: When inflation is rising dramatically, people may be afraid that they will be poorer than they were before. People are more willing to accept low paying jobs to improve their own health because they are not worried that there will no longer be a job available for them.<n>Output: In some countries, people may be willing to accept lower paying jobs for better health. When the cost of goods and services rises quickly, people who cannot afford their food may eat bread and soup to stay alive. When people can not afford bread or soup, they may stop eating altogether.<n>Output: If there is a shortage of money and everyone has the same amount, then prices are going down<n>Output: When there is a shortage, people will not pay so much because they feel they are more desperate than they really are.<n>Output: People who accept a raise in

Let x be a number between 20 and 120. Then the equation is x - $40 + x - 20 = $24<n>Freddy bought a Honda Civic Hatchback with 76,500 miles on it. It cost him $24. If all the miles are accounted for, $12.50 was left over.<n>So now his budget is $24 + x = $45. Therefore, Freddy's maximum budget is $18,000<n>Note: Because an extra 12 cents on $20 was left, $18,000 * $45 = $18,750.<n><n>What? The car is too expensive?<n><n>Input:At 50 cents a mile, charging a $20 car every day will cost Freddy $2 a day. How much do you think the price of a car at 1-5 cents a mile?<n>Output: Let w = 10. Let x = 0. Then the equation is w - 50 = >40<n>Using the example above, we can say that the price of a car starts at 1 cent per mile, and goes up at each mile.<n>In calculating this number, the formula is w - 50 x 0 = 1<n>Since x - 10 = 1, we can also think that the car charges a dollar every 10 minutes. So, x = 4<n>Since w is 10, we also think that the car will charge $4 every 10 minutes. Therefore, x = 10*w / 10 = $10<n>Total: $40 = $2/day<n>So, in short, the total cost of the car

She walked by the room door and saw nothing.  Yumiko then walked down the stairs, climbed up the stairs and found Cody sitting in the living room, completely naked.  Yumiko walked to the bedroom and found Cody lying next to Yumiko in bed.  She looked around and saw no bodies.  Yumiko opened the bedroom door, walked outside and called 911

Choices:  A: bathroom B: solar system C: coffee shop D: space shuttle E: airport<n>Output:		 Find the shortest path from the human to the water.<n>Input: Which is the shortest path from either A or B to the water? Output: A = D * E<n>The distance D + E from B to A is 5*5*5 = 250<n>So, the shortest route from the human to the place he sits is B * E = 250<n>Let's look at the different ways to reach the human from A. If the human walks, the road goes straight from A to B. Therefore, if the human walks towards A, he has to walk five and a half miles, 5.5 miles to reach the path he needs. We have already explored the concept of walking at a constant pace of four miles, so let's look at the next shortest way a human could find to reach B. If the human goes left, then he has to walk three miles, taking a left turn of 6.5 miles, just to reach a bridge from which he can walk another four or five miles to reach B. The shortest route from B to the bridge is B left. So to reach the bridge he must walk 15.6 miles in that direction. However, if the human decides to go right, then he can go two straight miles and a straight turn, just to reach the same place and not have to walk 15.6 miles back. The shortest route from A to B is B right. This route requires less walking because the human doesn't have to look both ways twice. The shortest route from one street to the other is Y = Y + U. Then U + (Y * (Y + U))) = U + [Y * (Y + (Y + U))) / (Y + (Y * U)))<n>The shortest route to the bridge is E left. So to reach E left, he would have to walk a total of 18.6 miles, taking E north and then south for two miles on either side, to reach the spot he needs to be.<n><n>Input:We can choose between two pairs of words.

Choices:  A: headaches B: bigger brain C: education D: growth E: knowing more<n>Output:		 You will have a big ass brain in 12 months<n><n>This week's topic can be defined quite simply.<n>Today, we have to look at the number 7 and think of what it can represent. 7 can represent the concept of a number, a number of factors being the same number, a number of components being the same number, or a specific number. Let's look at these examples using 7.<n><n>In the following discussion, it is important to understand what the 7 is to get the answer. In the examples we will discuss, we assume that we have access to knowledge. Knowledge doesn't have to be physical knowledge. Any and all knowledge we have, including those we don't have, could be understood through this concept. In this case, we have the knowledge of a number being equal to a number of factors being similar or the same. This could include any number of factors, just like we have 7's. Take an example from the example below that the student would choose themselves, and the answer is 1 + 7 + (5 - 5) = 9. Does 1 + 7 + (4 - 3) = 10 or (4 - 2) - 5 + (6 + 2) = 11? Using knowledge of a number, we can look at the two different situations to determine the answer.<n><n>In #1, we assume that the first number is the result of the fact that the second number is the same as the first number. As the second number is the result of that second number being the result of the first number, then the first number is the difference. Thus, the first number is the number of factors that are similar, and the second number is the number of factor components.<n>In #2, we assume each of the components are the result of the whole number being the same as the first unit. Thus, the whole number is the number of numbers that are similar, and each of the components are just the same number minus 1. Thus, the whole is the number of factors, and each individual component is just the sum of each of the individual totals.<n><n>In both #1 and #2, we are focusing on the fact that 7 represents a number with a relationship. 7 represents a number that can be viewed as the product of a number of factors being different. In fact, we can even say that knowledge with 7 has a form to it.<n><n>The final outcome of having 7 as knowledge with 7 is a larger brain in 12 months.

She can decide to stay, but she doesn't need her husband or children to tell her that, and she can be more careful (e.g. take a little longer to get ready to go by herself, or go home alone), or she can decide that she is better off alone and not worry about him, so when he says that he has to leave quickly, she should do the same thing and tell him to also leave right away. In another case, she can decide that she has a friend who would help her get away (although that friend may also be in trouble), so she thinks of that friend's name, and then decides that the friend will always support her and will stay with her, though the friend may not even be in sight because she probably has to hide, since she will be in trouble and may have already been seen by a predator or two.<n>Input: Are you the center of attention?<n>Output: Not so much at work, because of my good looks, but at home, I am not always the center of attention – people rarely think that a girl should be alone as much as she should be with her boyfriend. People seem to be more forgiving of an attractive female in general than they are of a guy, and some guys are more easily convinced of this than others.

Choices:  A: excitement B: fatigue C: anger D: hurting E: getting tired<n>Output:		 Playing soccer 6 years ago lead to a total of 6 years, 9 months and 29 days.<n><n>Solution Preview:<n><n>First, we want to say one thing that we should have seen before now, which is that a) not everybody can do it after the age of 30 (and not everybody can have it in their first try) and b) there is no limit as what your body can do. However, all the players in the game can play all the year. By now, not everybody is young man any more. In fact, there is quite a number of old men playing soccer. That is why they put the limit only for young men.<n>On the other hand, there are many people who have never played soccer. For the example, there is an old man who is almost 90 years old. He does not even have a bicycle. In this case, he have no chance to play some time more in the game. He will never play soccer again. But, now the question in my mind is what is he going to play when he gets old. We can say that the limit is not a strict one. It is not to put a limit only for very young men. It is more a limit in terms of fitness. But, I think by now that you know that the limit was put only for young men. How do we solve these problems in order to have a complete game that everybody is able to play?<n>In order to have a game for everybody not young men, some rules are need. Actually, there are not many rules since we have not played the game ourselves. So it is a good idea to write some rules before you start playing the game.<n>1) The ball has to be in a fair distance from the person who want to score.<n>2) If there is a mistake with a throw, the player should try to reset the ball to his feet again before the thrower. Otherwise, it would be the ball in the opponent's net.<n>3) If a goal occurs, the time for restarts will still be the same as for throws.

A new car dealer will give him a certain dollar amount if he would install X number of new lights around his house. Pete knows where the lights are going because he already installed them in his own house. So he asks the dealer how much it will cost him to do that. The dealer says it will be $3000. Pete replies, "Then the car dealer asked how many dollars he wanted for the lights. He offered a bonus. Pete told him 5 thousand.<n>Pete wanted to give the dealer 1,000 or 5 thousand. The dealer offered Pete 1,000, so Pete agreed to give him $500. He then asked for 2,000 dollars. The dealer agreed so he asked for $3,000 as Pete was very nervous. The dealer agreed but demanded a $500 deposit. Pete agreed so Pete agreed to the deposit and the 2,000 dollars. Before closing the sale, Pete needed the money because he was due to pay a lawyer $1500 but he had less than 2,000 dollars to spare. After the sale was completed, Pete called the dealer to ask about the lights. The dealer told him that if he took the deal and installed the lights he could keep the balance. This is how Pete got the 5 thousand he had left over before the sale. If Pete had taken the deal he would have never got that 5 thousand.<n>Output: The question above is a multiple choice question.<n>Input: At 5 cents a second, calling Pete cost him 15% less than if he had called someone else.

You say you'll pick up some snacks to take home. Mike says he'll get you something that sounds good. Mike picks through the fridge looking for anything good, when he finds a bottle of grape juice and some bananas. The bottle has a warning on it: drink it all or use it all, and Mike thinks that sounds like a good deal. You say they should just keep it and take a big drink, then take another small drink during lunch. When you finish your lunch, Mike is waiting outside. He says he got something good, and you both say you want to try it. Mike hands you a spoon and tells you to pick up something, which you do.

You grab the bottle and pour some out of the cap and into a bowl, and Mike says he didn't notice that anything was odd and throws the bottle away. Before Mike can tell you what's wrong, you start coughing. Mike says he's thinking about putting some aspirin in his drink. You say you've never even seen aspirin in a bottle, and Mike says, "Do you really want to do something stupid and take something you don't know?" You say yes, and Mike picks a piece of fruit that looks like a blue raspberry and tells you to eat the whole thing immediately. You choke on the fruit, and Mike says, "'You're all right, don't worry," and he puts some cloth to your mouth. The fruit is still there, so Mike reaches in and pulls it out and says, "I guess that would just be something to put on your nose." You spit the fruit and say you don't feel great. Then he puts some water in the bottle for you to drink before it shuts off. After taking a deep breath, you spit the water out and you cough, which Mike says, "Don't you know anything?" You say yes, you're sick, but Mike says that's stupid. You say yes, of course you can't drink it right there, so Mike pulls a water bottle out of the fridge. Mike

Choices:  A: tennis racket B: skill C: competition D: tennis court E: legs<n>Output:		 An easy answer. The goal is to hit a ball back to your opponent and hit a ball forward as fast and straight as possible to hit their opponent. You must make lots of revolutions and not miss the ball. Good tennis racket players can hit a ball with the same power as a ball hitting a wall for a good distance (like 100 meters). Good tennis court players can hit a ball for 60 meters and hit the ball again after a half-second without missing. Good legs players hit the ball straight with their whole body.<n>Example: The tennis ball can be hit for a very fair distance (like 100 meters) with a good racket player, but hitting the ball back is much harder. The problem is the force of the bounce. If the ball bounces too high, it bounces back low and your shot goes out of play. If the ball bounces to low, it hits you on the arm or shoulder and misses the shot. Even if you hit the ball directly on the ball's hit zone, it still bounces to low or goes out of play.<n>If you are a good tennis player, you are the best for some competitions. If you are decent to excellent, you can beat any other tennis player, except for world class greats like Murray, Federer, Nadal and Djoko. If you think you are really great, you can win even world or Olympic tournaments (that's doubles play). You can also win national and world tennis championships over the years. In other words, a good tennis player can play tennis professionally and compete at a high level. A good and fair racket is usually the most important thing.<n><n>Input: What is the length of a basketball with a diameter of 35 cm, a weight of 14 kg (33 lbs), a depth of 15 cm and a circumference of 20 mm?

This was bad.  He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n>Output:		 Allowing punches to make contact causes injury. Let x = the amount of blood John has thus far. He is clearly harming himself. Let y = the time it takes for the blood to dry from his knuckles. He has wasted 15 seconds, so this means he has wasted 15 hours to do something he did in 12 hours. Let z = his total time spent. Let u = the total time he spent cleaning his blood. Thus he is, in the present, an "hour in, hour out" jerk.<n>Output: Let y = the time he has wasted. Let z = the time he has spent cleaning. Since he is "an hour in, an hour out," his total time spent is U-Z = 100. Since he didn't spend much time changing his clothes or eating, his total time spent is 100 + U-Z = 300<n><n>Input:Bob, who lives in the US, calls Jane from the UK.

If she spends 5 minutes thinking that, then he probably spent 5 minutes thinking the same about her. At least that is what it looks like.<n>Input: John spends 5 minutes thinking he is much better than Jane. He thinks Jane isn't that bad. Then he spends 5 more minutes doing research on Perth and talking to Jane. Jane is completely unable again to understand why he spends so much time doing research on a place she has never visited.<n>Output: He is convinced Jane is much worse than him.

On Dec 31 he will call his dad, who lives on the opposite side of the world. Dad also called his brother, who lives in this city. He called them using the same phone line as Freddy's mum. At which time would it cost Freddy $1.25 extra to call his brother?<n>Output: 1.25 * 15 = 45 cents 2.25 * 15 = 63 cents 3.25 * 15 = 75 cents<n>Let x = the current phone rate of 75 cents per minute. If dad calls first and his brother calls later, he pays 63 cents less.<n>Combining these numbers, we get 15 * 63 = 225 cents.<n>Combining these two numbers we get 45 * 63 = 225 cents<n>Combining these two values we arrive at 45 + 60 = 225*63 = 225 cents.<n>Total: 225 × 15 = >1000 cents.<n>Subtracting the phone rate from each, we get 0.75 × 15 = 25 cents. Therefore Freddy spent 25 * 15 = 1.75 × 625 = 1.625 dollars.<n>Multiplying 1.625 × 625 = 625 x 625/225 = 75 cents<n>To round the number down, we apply the formula 75 + 25 = 325 + 225 = 325+75+75x.<n>The final answer is 325<n><n>Input: What is likely to have more money at the end of the year? Choose a higher number: A: cash B: salary C: savings D: total<n>Output: Choose a lower number.<n>Let x = the average number at the end of the month.<n>Then x = 25 cents less or $0.25.<n>(X − 25) - 25 is $0.25 - 25 = 75 cents.<n>Multiplying $0.25 - 75, and multiplying 75 × 75 by 25 equals 75 cents.<n>Multipping 75 × 75 times 25 is 75 x 75/375 = 25 cents. The final answer is 75 cents.<n>The amount we have left at the end of the day depends on the number of people we call and our phone bill.<n><n>Input: What are 3 cities that have less than one doctor per million people?

A week before the wedding Jane came to them and told them she was pregnant. They decided to have a baby as well, so John broke his leg.  John and Jane got married one night and had a baby the next as well.  On the day of the wedding the two met their relatives on the street. John's sister announced that he had suffered a heart attack and died within a month to a year of marrying the girl. They got married once more and had a baby together. They decided to go to bed.<n>John woke up a day after the wedding and felt pretty good. The pain of his old leg was still there to remind him that Jane and the child he had with her were not dead. He was going to take the train home for an exam in a few days, and had to go away with some friends before the exams. As he was about to go to bed, his leg began to feel the unbearable pain from his broken knee. The pain didn't stop, so he went back to bed. Two nights later Jane started to cry and told him that she was pregnant again.  He didn't know what she was talking about. The next night the pain in his leg became unbearable, so he decided to walk a bit, and he woke up again.  After this time the pain in his leg never stopped.

She explained to him that he needed to have an operation, but she was not allowed to treat Jane, as Jane was still very young. The operation went well, and he came home with an infant. Before the operation, he told Jane that he had to make a decision. He must now decide one thing. He must choose between Jane and the baby. He had no feelings of jealousy for the baby. He must choose the baby because he had given Jane so much love and care. He had never given love or care to anything as old as a baby.  He was the baby's protector; she could always count on him. He put everything in the best possible condition for the baby to grow up with. He then chose himself and Jane, and that was that.  After leaving the hospital, Jane and the infant were alone.<n>Jane cried for a while;

Choices:  A: school B: home office C: people store D: print shop E: newspaper office<n>Output:		 There are a variety of locations for printing. The most frequent ones are school, home office and print shop. Schools are typically used in the morning and the evening. Homes are typically used on the weekends and in the summer. The most frequent place for printing, however, is also by many individuals: newspaper offices.<n>The most common paper used at newspaper offices is the notebook paper. This paper is produced using a process called printing. When the sheet of paper is cut in to the desired length, this is called a cutting. Then a laser beam scans the paper, forming the desired number of lines. After the necessary number of lines have been printed, the paper is folded and rolled up into a bundle. The bundle can then be taken to the nearest newsstand, bookseller or office supply store to buy papers and paper-related supplies.<n>Print shops are very common in many parts of the world. They provide the printing of articles such as newspapers, magazines and textbooks, and they typically charge between $10 and $20 for a single article, depending on the specific size. They offer printing from plain copies of newspapers and magazines to books with full color printing to custom-made papers, such as folders and notepaper.<n>A newspaper office is a space where newspaper articles are printed. Print shops can range between large-scale operations that only print large documents, with hundreds of thousands of copies, to small-scale operations that print a number of different newspapers with as few as 10 copies per week. The most common types of newspapers that a newspaper office prints are news print from national publications, weekly publications, regional newspapers etc. However, you can also find newspapers that sell only newspapers. A newspaper office also prints copies of magazines, magazines dedicated to specific interests or topics and also some books.

All the children are born in two separate times. Then the same child gets to choose which time of the month he wants to be born. Which of the following is an easy way to have the best outcome for the baby?<n>Output: Let f(x) = (x-x) + y' = the formula for the child's age/size. Then let v = the velocity of the balloon and q = the rate for the child to grow. Then let e = the distance between the child and his mom (the distance from the balloon to the balloon mom). Then let t = the time needed to grow. So, the formula for the child is: f(x) = <x+t> - y' = <x+t-e/v> =<x+t-v> + q = <x+q>/t<n>If we add them together with an integral of time and a rate, we get the formula for the child.<n><n>Input:The baby's mom, Jane, has a condition that says the baby cannot move for one year.

And since it would be Friday by that time anyways, you can't go out on Friday. You need to make the payment on Wednesday and get it paid off by Friday.<n>So because you can't wait until 5:00 on Friday, Tuesday would be too late to make the payment. You must make the payment on Wednesday. And the payments for that week will need to be made on Wednesday.<n>So you must make your payment on Wednesday.<n>So Wednesday is the earliest you can make the payment, because Tuesday would be too late.<n>So Wednesday is your Thursday. You are not allowed to go out on Thursday.<n>So you must do Wednesday and pay off the loan. And the payment for that week will need your payment on Wednesday. So Wednesday is the earliest you could make the payment on Wednesday, because Wednesday would be too late. You must make the last payment at 8:00pm<n>So you must do Tuesday and Thursday.<n>It gets worse and worse. You can only choose Tuesday and Thursday. And they have to be different days. So you make the payments on Tuesday and Thursday. And you don't get paid on Tuesday and Thursday.<n>So on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, you missed the payment deadline and lost the week. How many work days are in each week? How many hours are you at work? Then you are going to miss the Friday due to your work schedule. That's 20 work days. Then in the week you had lost the week

Or use a digital scale<n>Solution: Add to the pot, 1/3 tsp salt for 100 ml water.<n>Solution: The final answer is 310 mg<n><n>Input:How much ketchup should be used for a meal when making it?Output: 150 ml in one serving<n>Solution: 150 ml in one serve (30% of total diet) is correct. We used 50 ml liquid Ketchup (a tablespoon and salt).<n>Solution: The final solution is 150 + 150 = 150 ml. For 1 tsp ketchup, using a tablespoon and 20% salt, you can't have too much, but you can still have too little.<n>Solution: The correct percentage for 1 tsp liquid ketchup is 150 + 10% = 150 ml.<n>Solution: The value of 1 tsp liquid ketchup depends how much you are using relative to other ingredients as well. You need less using Ketchup with less salt and ingredients as you do more with less salt and ingredients. You can also add less to ingredients like vegetables, fruit and cereal if you want to use more ketchup. This would be the appropriate amount for Ketchup.<n>Solution: The amount for 1 tsp liquid ketchupp is 150 + 10% of your total diet = 1 tsp ketchup<n>Solution: 10% is a good number, but you have to weigh what other ingredients you are using (how many cups of rice does it make up, how much of meat does it make up, etc.) To answer this question, we used both. The portion of calories and nutrients in your own food and the portion of calories and nutrients that comes from other foods that have a similar amount of nutrients as far as your body is concerned. So when you are measuring, we took the number of calories per serving, divided 2 by 2 and then took a guess at what that number would be for that particular portion.<n>Solution: 50 ml (30% of your total diet) is correct

The most common cause of motorcycles being involved in accidents is speeding. They are often forced to take side roads during peak congestion due to a lack of traffic in the main streets. During rush hours, motorcyclists need to take very tight maneuvers in order not to be impeded by cars to stay on the road and take the most efficient path that doesn't cause an accident. The motorcyclist, while maneuvering, has limited reaction time and the rider is often involved in an accident either due to speeding, distraction, or a sudden collision with something else like a vehicle. In some cases, the rider is able to escape the scene without sustaining injuries.<n><n>Input:A family has a long train journey to Los Santos. At the station, a crowd of people is waiting. Some stand quietly in the station while others sit and wait for a train. The waiting crowd moves slowly. The train comes slowly down the line. The crowd keeps following the train. It doesn't move fast. The crowd makes no attempt to move closer to the front of the platform. A police officer approaches the line and asks the crowd to stand still. The crowd continues to stand still. The officer, a lady, tries getting closer to the crowd and asks everyone to stand still. While trying to get closer, she can hear faint sounds coming from the inside of the train. The lady quickly steps out of the train entrance. Her friends rush after her, yelling for her to turn around and go back inside. As soon as she turns to go back in, she screams out loud as the train speed rises. She manages to fall onto the tracks as the train speed increases. As she hits the rails, the crowd falls silent and turns away from the train.

The tree will form a symmetrical branch which is perpendicular to the top and bottom of the branches. There are points within a single group that are not on either side of the line drawn through them. The point closest to each line is the center point. The top and bottom line on the branch will be parallel to the plane of the branch. If two groups have the same center point, their points fall within the same group.

In my school years,  teachers would often talk about New Year's Day celebrations in different parts of the world and  we would read the newspaper during class.<n>Output:<n>This is from the New York Times, Sunday, Jan 12, 1969<n>You are angry. You are concerned about people suffering. You are worried about the state of the world, about the future of our world. Your anger towards your brother in school and the world will only continue as long as the war continues in the Middle East.<n>In school, we never actually talk about the war going on in Vietnam.  This is because we have never been asked or taught about it in class. What we do learn, is that over 400,000 people have been killed since the war in Vietnam began. The war is still going on over there. In 1969, when this newspaper was written, there were still 11 bombs being dropped a day.<n>There is little to nothing in school, that would help me understand the war going on in the Middle East. If, I had been given information about the war going on there, I would have already realized that the only reason the war was going on there was because of the government of the United States.<n>The only thing that is mentioned about the war in Vietnam is the killing of the people there. The school system does not teach children why they do kill these innocent people. In my life, I have never once been asked, nor have any of my relatives, when I was born, which country I live in, why the war started in Vietnam. All they tell us is, "We don't know. That's why we are fighting." We are taught nothing of the reason behind the war or about the reasons why the war is going on.<n>In my hometown in rural central Illinois.  The teachers at the school where I attended do not ask any questions when it comes to the war in Vietnam or about the war going on over there. I do not understand why. If I asked my parents why they could not ask any questions, they would tell me the same thing that we were taught in school.  "We don't know." That's why we don't ask, and we are taught not to ask.<n>I know these are very hard times in the world today. Many people are suffering from war and pain. I don't know how many Americans have had to move out of their hometown or how many

He is a nice guy, and always has some spare change on him, which he uses to buy a new game each week. In fact, every week he buys 3 new video games to play, but then he just never plays them. One day, he decides to try to play one of his favourite games, and proceeds to beat the game, but after 30 minutes is sick and tired of playing. He decides to buy a coffee in a nearby coffee shop. The shop-keeper charges him $3.75 plus VAT for the cup of coffee. If John refuses to drink the coffee, the shopkeeper will not give him the money. The shopkeeper's wife enters the shop and accuses John of cheating. John's sister, Jane, then enters and accuses the shopkeeper of also cheating. Jane also accuses the shopkeeper of leaving his wife, and then leaves the shop. The shopkeeper's son, John, then enters and accuses himself of being the one who betrayed his family. However, the shopkeeper does not buy into any of the accusations, explaining that he too had cheated his family at some point in the past. Ultimately the shopkeeper decides to leave the shop with his son and take John home, much to John's disappointment. They end up playing together one last time in John's room. John then gives an excuse for why he is not finishing the game, explaining that he has not yet finished the story, to which John says, "That is what makes it a new game." After giving the excuse, he asks what John would have gotten for playing the game for 30 minutes. John replies, "A $1 bill!"

We're only being told about the fact that a bad guy did something bad. The only way to find the truth is if we're actually told about the bad thing someone did. So it makes sense to ask "What does it mean when this guy says ignorance is an excuse for the crime?" What does it mean when a bad person says ignorance is an excuse?<n>To see a bad person and tell him his actions are wrong, we look at the fact that he made bad decisions. If the crimes were caused by ignorance, then this is an excuse for it. But ignorance isn't an excuse for the crimes. So we need to find out if this guy has any evidence to show he's lying, and the answer is no. He's not telling the truth. So he's lying. A lie is when someone tells a lie knowing there will be a punch in the face. A good lie is when someone tells the truth knowing they'll face a punch in the face because the truth is hard to swallow. So D is the answer.<n><n>Input: The year is 1970 and a man has been accused of raping his 11-year-old daughter. He wants to hire a lawyer. A lawyer costs $800.

On Tuesday the average temperature is 34*F. How many degrees would it take just for the average temperature to be 51*F.<n>Output:  I believe this problem is to complex to answer in less than 20 minutes. You can write out as much as you like but it would be too long. A simpler way to do this would be to look at the chart on page 513 of my book "How to Study."  If average daily temperature has been between 42*F and 46*F for the past 3 weeks, the average day temperature after 5 days should be 52*F.<n>Let's assume we are on page 15 of the chart. So the actual average temperature should be 54*.9. We will average these two so 51.9 and 54*.9 = 57*F.<n><n>Input:<n>The average temperature in Chicago on July 3 is 65*F.<n>On Tuesday the temperature is 55*F. How many days will it take to reach 65*F?(15)<n>Output: 15 = 65/2 = 49*F<n>Let's assume we have just passed Monday's average temperature and can average all the rest of them to arrive at 65*F. This will give us a time to calculate the next highest. If we average 54*F until the end of the week, the average day temperature for the next week will be 63*F. Let's average 55*F over the past week and a half to reach the new record of 65*F.<n>Output<n>65*F = 54*F + (54*F - 55*F) + (55*F - 59*F) + (54*F + 60*F) + (64*F - 67*F) = 66*F<n>So now we are at 56*F. Let's add 30*F to get 68*F for tomorrow. Then we would be at a new record of 69*F.<n><n>The average temperature:<n>the temperature in Chicago<n>The average temperature per 100 miles<n><n>The

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:The window of the Honda was hit from the inside, not the outside.

She refuses, saying that it would be cruel because none of them is blind. Freddy comes home with a box from Costco, asking for bread instead, so he goes to the kitchen to find out if there is bread there. Freddy's sister makes him a sandwich with half of the cake flour and half of the bread. Which cake flour do they use? Output: If it's a sandwich, then they only use 1/2 of cake flour and 1/2 of bread.<n>Input: Freddy goes to the garage because his father is working there. When he comes back, his father asks him to take a look at something. He looks in the attic and finds a large box filled with cake flour that is almost all broken. Which part of the cake flour can he use to make a cake? Output: The only part of the cake flour that might be useful in making a cake would be the moist crumb. So he can use this piece. If he had to pick one of the other things that are in the box, we'll assume half. Which of the pieces is the moist crumb?<n><n>Input:When a driver goes through a toll booth, the tollbooth operator will give an automated signal if it detects that the car has been going more than 100 miles per hour. He asks Freddy to find out how fast was the car going so the operator can calculate the toll fee, which will be charged. Assuming that they are going 20 mph, then Freddy wants to know how fast Freddy is going so they can get $75 for the toll, which he earns by driving 20 mph faster than the posted speed limit. Freddy is driving 10 mph over the speed limit, so he gets $75 for driving 10 mph faster than the posted limit. Freddy and his sister take out one piece of cake on the way home. If they take out 2 pieces, then the total won't be $75. If they take both, then the total won’t be $35. So the total piece cake costs them $105.<n>Input: A driver goes to a toll booth to pay a toll. When the tollbooth operator asks him for his car’s speedometer, he answers

With the capital it has, it can invest wisely and try to make money.<n>If it did make money, then it could pay its employees a fairly decent wage and they could buy good food. Since it would make more money, an investor could buy some stock so that he/she would earn more money. However, he/she probably wouldn't sell his/her stock for that much money, because he/she would see that it was still a loss, because if it loses money, it will go down in price.<n>If it did loose money then the loss (income and expenses) would go down.

A lot of people are talking about the stock prices but even more about the people. A lot of people talk about their jobs, but a few are talking about the other people at the company. Then again, not that many people care about those things because they live in a different city than the employees.<n>Conclusion: Most of these people care about what is going to happen with the company. Since they live in different cities, they could care about that more than the company.<n><n>Input: Freddy and his friends are going to the movies for New Year's.

The first kitten runs away and the second kitten runs away. When the second kitten runs away the second kitten's mother is very angry as she knows that the first kitten ran away and now she cannot get a hold on the first kitten. If the second kitten runs away three times the first kitten runs away twice as fast making it more important that the second kitten runs away than the first. Also as a male he must keep it up with the first. He runs in circles around the first, but all the other males are running around the second kitten who is very confused. At the end he runs around the first kitten again but he is not as fast as the second kitten so he does not get away. If the second kitten was more interested in the first then the other three would run from him. If the second kitten didn't run as fast as the other two and still caught them the mother would still be very upset and run after him. Because this mother has her son by the tail and is worried about him and is very angry at him. Since they run faster then the other two she won't give them any food or anything. It is obvious that the second kitten is doing something more then this mother wants him to do. If the other two animals got along with the second kitten she would be happy. If they were to run away she would make them run back so that they wouldn't get eaten.<n>Output: As the female is more willing to eat out of the others mouths than the males she must be more interested in the second kitten.<n><n>Input:What does it represent if you add four and then add a fifth finger?

He has 9 candies on the bottom shelves and 6 candies on the top shelves. What are the average amounts?<n>Output: Let v = [9, 13] * [0, 10, 10].<n>v = 90 candies<n>Since 9 candies have an average of 20 cents, we get 20 candies<n>Input: John has 55 candies in his fridge and 25 candies in the freezer. What are the 5 candies in the freezer that he uses the most?<n>Output: Let w = [2, 2, 0, 0].<n>(2x + 0, 2x + 15, 2x + 15) x [0, 2, 2] = 75 candies<n>The final equation is 75 candies + 25 candies = 105 candies + 25 candays<n>Combining like terms we get 105y<n>Subtracting 75y from 10 y, we get y = <<30=30Y, so 90ys<n>Note that each y = <<30

He teaches a course called Calculus. The requirements for the course are to learn this concept: Let y = {0} + (2*x^{\frac{1}{x-1}}) * 10 + 5*x^{\frac2x}{y-1}}, where x = 0 and y = 7*2*(2*10^\frac{1}{x} ).<n>The problem is, Takashi can't remember how he got from 0 to y = {0}.<n>To solve this problem, we'll look at a problem we learned in grade school. Let y = {1} + ((1+10^\frac{y}{x}}) * 10 + 3*x^{\frac{\frac2x}{x-1}}).<n>Where the value of y is between 1 and 10.<n>Subtracting the given two values yields, y = {0}<n>In contrast, y = 0 is x^{\frac{1-x}}.<n>Therefore, if 10^{\frac{y}{x-1}} = 0, x must be x=0+10^{\frac{1}}.<n>Now x must be x/10 = 0.<n>Subtract 10^{\frac{x}{10}} from x, and this must be 1.<n>Let y and x = x/10.<n>Subtract 15 from y, and we have y = {0} - 3*5*x+0 x + 0x^10.<n>Subtraction between 1.5 and 10 will give us x = 10/5 = 0.5x.<n>Subtract 0.5 from x, and we get x = y/(15 * 0.5) = y(1 * 0.5) - 0.5x^2, and 0x^2^2 = 0.5x+0.5x*0.5.<n>Where 0.5 and 0.5 are the difference in y and x.<n>Then, x^2*0.5x is equal to 5*0.5, so y=5*0.5x -5 = 5*0.5.

Choices:  A: go shopping B: generous C: earn money D: have money E: gift buyer<n>Output:		 Let x be the number of gifts you buy for one other person for this year. Take the difference between y and x, then subtract 1 from either side of that. For instance, the above equation suggests that Freddy will buy 10 gifts this year, so y = 7 and x = 9. Then we get x = 2, so y - 1 = 0. Therefore, the final gift you buy this year will be x * 9. That would be Y = 15<n>Let's check the first part of the equation:<n>y = 7 * 9 = 20. In this case, the value of x is 5. Therefore, we can write down the total gift value as Y = 15<n>Since 10 = 20 ^ 5 = 100<n>Y = 15<n>So it is possible to determine the gift cost for each person using the equation<n><n>Input:A woman recently had her right shoulder replaced at a cost of 5500 naira.

He stops at a stop sign to take a picture of his license plate at night. With the light off, he takes his phone up to his face and turns it on (without touching the phone), while he is speaking his license plate out loud. Then he calls home and tells his mom what just happened.<n>Now, we know that he is talking to his mom, but what happens if he is texting on the phone and doesn't answer the phone? How do we know whether or not the text is being spoken?<n>Output:Let z = a number representing the position Freddy is at on the screen when he says his license plate out loud on his phone. z = 25<n>Output:As his license plate is said out loud on his phone, we should see z increase.<n>But how would you know whether the license plate has been said out loud in text?<n>Input:When Freddy is driving along the highway and he comes across a sign for a restaurant, he turns his car to go straight to the restaurant even though the car is clearly going straight. Freddy says his license plate on the phone is "GUTS," which would make sense since G is the letter and T is the number after S. However, this is not a response to the sign -- it is his real license plate. If Freddy's parents answered his phone at home and he was using a text message, Freddy would have told them that he texted "GUTS" to the restaurant, which they would see as a signal to answer him at home. But since Freddy told his mom he didn't respond to the restaurant sign, then we can only assume Freddy was not texting, rather, he was driving to a restaurant at night.<n>Output: Freddy is driving along the highways and he stops at a restaurant that is located along the road that it is not in his best interest to be driving. Freddy is at risk of running into a car heading the opposite direction. Therefore, Freddy should text something to his mom in order to let them know he is running late. Because Freddy said his license plate is "G

So my strategy is to buy a ton of beer, bring the bottles and can’t finish them, have one with every drink or take a can of beer home and bring that along. I need to earn about 8 thousand dollars. So I just started selling this type of products recently, I am not sure if I can make so much on it. I am using a system I have been developing. The system allows buying and selling of beer.

If A, choose zoo!<n><n>Subjunctive mood<n><n>Let A = the set of all words in the form A + an arbitrary word and  B = the set of all verbs in the form B + an arbitrary word where B can be either an objective or a subjective component.  C = the set of all ideas corresponding to statements that are in the form A +  B +  C.<n><n>Analogous to the case of a verb, the subject of a sentence can be an object.  This makes a sentence of verb form:<n>"Dora wants to go to the zoo."<n><n>However, we can also express the sentence in verb form:<n>"If her friends call her Dora, she doesn't like it."<n><n>In this form, we use the following rule:<n>"If A + B / √ a is the subject of the sentence, then A is also part of the sentence."<n><n>To see the differences between the two forms:<n>"Dora and her friends like going to the zoo."<n>"But if she is called *Dora, she doesn't *tolerate it."<n>"If her friends called Dora, A won't like it."<n>"Since B is the objective component, that part of the sentence cannot be said to be in the verb form."<n><n>The analogies between A, B, and C explain each case differently.

These elements contain information within a webpage; while HTML codes are often used to display data within a webpage. However, the two most common uses of elements in the Web are not the same as the most common uses of codes.<n>The most common use of HTML elements for content is as a form element, which uses the <field> element to set values (for example, input fields, form content, etc.) within their scope. HTML codes are often used for form elements, in addition to their use in CSS, because many code editors allow this to be done with a single code change. However, HTML codes are most often used for display and layout. They are used most often to make a webpage appear more appealing than if it were not. The following are most common uses for HTML codes and are used most commonly: <h1>; <p>; <img>; <br />; <li>; <div>; </div>; <a id="fancy"></a>; </p>; </div><n>The second most common use is as an input element. In most common use cases, an input element is used to send data from an external source; in other words, to send an external data packet. Two common use case are to create a webpage that accepts data from an external source and display that data on the webpage (for example, a form for a data exchange (user to user exchange)) and to create a webpage that contains an external file (for example, an external text file). This can also be seen as the inclusion of external files into a webpage. The following are common uses of functions: <h1>This document is here (http://x.y.z/y.z)</h1> <p>This document is there (http://x.x.y./x.y.z).</p>; <img src="http://x.x/1#/2_z.i3#/3_z.i7#/4_z.i9.5" /><n></p>; <a href="http://x.y/1#/x.y.z">This web page is here X x y y z</a>;<n></div>; </div><h1

Choices:  A: grand casino B: large room C: restaurant D: country club E: lobby<n>Output:		 (A) grand casino (B) large room (C) room (D) lobby<n>The answer is (C)<n><n>Input: Which is the better alternative to a one-stop-shopping convenience store:  A: a big box store that sells lots of products B: an individual store that specializes in one small area<n>Output: (A), (B)<n>The answer is correct. The store is better if the type of store is selling small items, like home accessories or jewelry. For example, if you're a jewelry store, you will usually sell jewelry sets -- this is one small area and may only be open for a few hours. On the other hand, if you're a grocery store, you will also sell cereal, fruit, and vegetables. So even though you buy groceries in a single location, each location will usually sell slightly different products (A) or a unique product (B). So, although individual stores sell similar products, the store in front of me sold almost the same merchandise in all four locations, and because I wasn't buying the same products, the store in the middle was the most convenient.<n><n>Input: I have 6 hours to work, 7 hours of classroom lectures, and 4 hours of office time.<n>Output: 5 hours of lecture, 8 hours of office work, and 5 hours of classroom lectures.<n>Since 8 hours of lecture = 5 hour total, 5 hour total = 4 hour total, and classroom lectures are 1 hour long, I divide 4 hours by 5, so classroom speeches are actually 4 hours long.<n>Thus total = 55 hours = 4 hour total<n>Since 55 hours of office work = 2 hour total, 1 hour total = 5 hour total, I divide 5 by 4, so office work is actually 1 hour long. Thus total = 30 hour total<n>Thus total = 30 hour total = 2 hour total  (so class work)<n><n>Input: The world's largest indoor ski slope is in Whistler, Canada. It has 20,000 square meters of slopes, and is the biggest in the world. The slope is named Mt. Tranquility.

It is said that the best snow is in the spring, which is good from April through June, so this is usually the snowiest season.

At the same time he calls his brother and tells him that his family is about to come to his house. For this to work, Freddy has to get enough money. How much should he ask his parents for?<n>Answer: Lets take the following equation: 2x + 8*(-8)*(-8)*(-8)/2 = 58 * (-56)/(((-8)/(-8))*8)/2<n>Subdivide this into 58 and divide 58 * 56/(((-28)/(8)*(-8))*28) = 57 * 8/(((-8/(8))/(8))) = 58 * 56.<n>Substitute 58/56*8/(((-8)/(-4) + -8)) = 58 + 56 + 56 + 56 /((8/(-8))/(8)) = 59.<n>Substituting 59/56*8/8 /8 /8 = 57 / (8/8), we get: 1.5 x 58 / (2x + 1.5 + 1/4)/(-1) = 7.8 x 59 * 8 = 14.4 x<n>So 7.8 x 14.4 x 8/2 = 10 x 58 = 25 cents.<n>Now we get the rest of the equation: 2x + 25 x 58 = 25 x 10 * 58 = 5 = 10 * 58 cents.<n>Since 10 is 2 cents, Freddy's total cost is 25 cents.<n>This is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:Freddie and his brother are in high school. His brother says he can't get a scholarship due to his grades. Freddy disagrees, because he's on merit. If he doesn't get into college, he'll never graduate, and then he's finished.

As plants grow, sunlight moves away from the plant. If the plant is planted in a garden where the sun shines almost 24 hours a day, the percentage of organic matter lost will be low.

The lid can also be pulled tight to keep the candy solid. However, if you\u2019ve ever had a can of soda you know it is not edible. What is the lid made of? Does it have any holes?

{"text": "C\n\nInput:The number of dollars required to break the bank account of a homeless beggar is $100,000. It is said that if the homeless person is given $100 dollars after he breaks his bank account, he will eat food. You will find the dollar amount as:\nOutput: $100,000 x 50 = $50,000\nHowever, if you are giving more than money, then you have to change the number of dollars into a different account. For example, if you give $150 to the poor person, he will eat and may need more money in the future. So, he needs $150,000 of your money or $10,000 of some other account or other. Therefore, you need to multiply the amount of money into at least 10 different accounts. For example, let's say you are giving 100 dollars to the homeless beggar. You will have $100,000 times the amount of money and add up the accounts\nResult:\n0 = $100,000\n100,000 = $500,000\n500,000 x 50 = 50,000\n50,000 x 50 = 300,000\nYou can also multiply the number of different accounts into 100 and add them up.\n100 x 50 = 200,000\n200,000 x 50 = 600,000\n600,000 x 50 = 1.5 million\nSo the final answer depends on the number of accounts you multiply. For example, if\n0 = 0 - 100,000 = $100,000, then it has a total of 100\n100,000 + 100 = 300,000\nIn this case, it has a total of 1.5 million\n150 + 300 = 5,000,000\n5,000,000 x 2,250,000 = $16 million\n16 million divided by 2 thousand three hundred = $16.3 million\nSo the final number is $16\n\nInput:The two sisters are standing in an empty room.

So a black and white image gives approximately 1% less blue. So 1.9% of blue light is lost in the photo. 1% of 1.9% is lost due to the black and white picture. One can extrapolate this to about 200 more blue points compared to what a white image would give.\nOutput: 2.3% of white light is lost in a picture of black and white.\nA 2.3% loss of total blue light is exactly one point on a 10mm focal length. A white photo of that intensity would take a 100mm lens, and that lens would only be able to resolve 20mm.\nSo the value of the black and white image would be two points less than a white image.

The photo is not the same as the image. Some objects are lighter than others. How does the color balance change when the image is flipped upside down?\nAnswer: The light is spread around the image like the blue light would be. So the blue light is distributed evenly by the objects. This is exactly the same as the way that light reflects from an image, a normal photograph. But the way that light reflects off of an image is in a plane. If the image is flipped, the light pattern of the flipped image moves backwards. So the blue light pattern follows the plane around the flipped image. So the blue light intensity diminishes.\nOutput:\nOutput 1 = 2.4%\nOutput 2 = 3.1%\nOutput 3 = 5.9%\nOutput 4 = 14.1%\nOutput 5 = 35.1%\nOutput 6 = 54.7%\nOutput 7 = 79.7%", "answer": "D: compete with each other"}

The number of steps in a dance class varies from person to person because different people have different abilities. The number of steps may vary from person to person because the human body responds differently to different stimuli and the way that a person moves to the music is also different.\nThe number of steps may vary because the human body responds different to different stimuli and the amount of steps may vary because people learn by example and the number of steps should be consistent from person to person.\nThe human body responds differently to all of these stimuli and the reason why we learn by example is also because we learn better by observing that we do the same things that others do and we tend to get frustrated by having problems with understanding things that other people do, so we learn by example rather than reading the manual or watching a video on the subject.\nThe number of hours that you spend learning will depend on the type of dance class that you take, there are certain dance classes that are better for certain people than others, for some people it may take three months of study to learn every choreography, for others, it may take only 6 weeks to learn how to break a certain choreography, and that\u2019s normal depending on how long you need to review before you actually learn it. For example if you are studying classical ballet, you will probably take 3 months to study from the beginning, and if you are studying jazz or country western, the time frame may vary a little less, maybe 5-8 weeks.\n\nInput:The answer to this question:", "answer": "D: become tired"}

Falling from a bridge does kill a person instantly as the person hits the ground. There is no time delay for a person to die instantly after a fall from a bridge. If a person dies then another one will try to help or run to the location where they are located. If a person dies this way they are not really dead they just are dead enough that they are not likely to make it back alive\nIn the case where someone falls from a cliff they will survive. In the case where someone dies the person goes back to their last known position. Someone dying is not being killed by a fall.\n\nInput: A picture of Robert\u2019s mother and father is placed on a table. Robert is at a computer looking at the picture.

If the child cannot read for himself, then maybe the child would do better on tests by reading fewer pages. But this is not actually a charity.\n\nIt would be a lot better to say that it is a financial gain for the child. It is a way of incentivizing the child to study. Incentivizing a child is better than saying they are being good citizens. Giving these people money is better than a tax deduction.\n\nA donation of money for a child to study is not like a donation to a charity. It is a way to incentivize the child to study.

Output: A = 150 * 50 * 5 + 50 * 3 = 155\n\nExample: A professor who gives his students 5 sentences for the presentation that have to be 5 pages long. The first sentence must be a complete one sentence. Therefore, there is a total of 15 sentences. The second sentence must be two sentences. Therefore, there is 15 + 2 = 25 sentences. If we divide the total number of words in two, the total number of sentences is 15, which equals 105. Therefore the sum of all the sentences in the paper is 105. In order for the sum of all the 5 sentences to be 145, we must figure that the total number of words for each of the five sentences is 30.

{"text": "Inflation does not cause problems. It just pushes prices to the limit. If inflation is lower than the value of labor-owned assets, some people will sell their goods at face value and get free money (money that inflation takes from the owners), but the majority of owners will get nothing because their assets are always worth more than the price paid for them.\nInput: Inflation is just food poisoning.\nOutput: If food poisoning causes people to stop buying food, they have to eat less food because you have to cook it, clean it up, and buy more of it. So there is less food available to everybody. And nobody eats more food because you need to cook it. So everybody is eating less food. So inflation does not cause food poisoning. But it does cause people to stop eating. And a lot of people stop eating because they do not have enough money and are hungry all the time because inflation is always increasing.\nInput: People get shot after it rains, which causes food scarcity if it rains all the time.\nOutput: People get shot during all seasons, so water scarcity is normal.\nInput: When you\u2019re hot, you spend the day outside and avoid all cool-weather clothing.

In solving the Rubik\u2019s cube, logic is also considered when choosing the order you will solve the cube. In order to solve the cube you have to complete the left side first before you start to solve the right side. The reason that you would choose which order you solve the cube first is because the order a cube is seen in makes a difference when solving the cube. For example, the red cube has less corners than the blue cube. So, if we solve the red cube first, we would have a shorter run to make it through the corners. If we solve the blue cube first, we will have to make more trips through the corner to be able to get to the same amount of corners. For this reason we should solve the opposite cube first, as it allows us to easily determine how many corners we can get through. Once we solved the blue side, we would move on to solve the red side. It is more comfortable to solve the blue side first and skip the red side because it is easier. By skipping the red side, one can have a shorter run back to their starting point.\n\nYou will be asked to answer this many choice multiple choice problem in the form below.

Choices:\nSchoolroom B\nLibrary D\nSchoolroom B\nSchoolroom B\nA playground in a public place is considered a public place. Students at an elite school would never spend much time at a playground. To a child, a playground is a place for playing with friends. Students at elite schools spend a lot of time at gym. The difference would be that the children at elite schools would never see a table in gym. It doesn\u2019t matter if you call a table in gym a \u201ctable\u201d, it\u2019s still a table.\nTo a child, gym is a place for playing, not for learning.

However, most parents don\u2019t need to go to gym. Most kids spend their time playing with friends outside or going outside.\nAs you can see, gym is just a place kids go to play.

The next rat that got caught in the trap was an egg and another egg. The next mouse was in a box with a door on the inside. Ham sent the other rats out to eat the food found in the boxes and eat the mouse traps. The rat named Scratty thought that Ham needed to find food outside so he devised a new trap.

{"text": "Problem C = B is correct  Baby = C is correct  Overpopulation was what resulted  You were correct  You were wrong  You were right\n\nInput: If a child is born into a family with two parents, how does being raised in that family affect its future?\nOutput: I\u2019d say it doesn\u2019t because in a family with two parents you aren\u2019t that close to one another, but you are a little closer to the child because it spends a lot more time with you.\nSo we are really just talking about less of a relationship between father and child. The father only helps with some things, and doesn\u2019t do as much. So, in that way, mother and child are more independent.\nSo that means if a father and son are raised together, the son is more likely to be independent in later years. That isn\u2019t really the answer. We want to take a look at what the role of the parents is in a child\u2019s life, which means that father-child relationships have more of an impact on children than the actual father-mother relationship.\nSo, in this case, if you are the father, you have influence over your child, but that influence isn\u2019t that substantial.

C: B: D: C: D\nOutput: B\n\nIn physics, the chirped beam is a device in which the wavelength of infrared radiation passing through a sample is controlled. The objective is to reduce the number of photons falling in the same location within a specified time interval, usually measured in microseconds. A device is generally used to control the emission of a specified wavelength of infrared radiation at a certain time of the day. In order to control the wavelength of the light emitted, two waveguides are normally required. The wavelength of the light emitted from the second waveguide depends on the angle between an optically active material layer located between the first waveguide and the second waveguide. The material used to make the optically active material layer depends on the wavelength required, which usually ranges from about 420 nm to about 500 nm. In order to control their wavelength, the optically active materials can be combined either by superposition between two waveguides or through optical parametric optimization (OPO). Thus, chirped beam can be used for controlling the emission of infrared", "answer": "E: wet"}

So, they jump out of the pool and climb to the swings. They make it to the top but then the branch ends on a small platform instead of a large platform and they fall off the swing. So, they climb to a branch, swing through the top, then jump off and climb to another branch. They can jump off and climb the swings again for a while. So they go around and around and around.

I always think of the value of a point when I draw using point or dot notation. The value of a point is a combination of its direction and the length of the edge. If the length of the edge is 1, then the value of the point is 1 plus 3. If the length of edge is.1, then the value of a point is.1 minus.01.\nAlso, this question is pretty simple to ask. You look at the question and the answer it gives to your question and you answer it. As long as the answer isn\u2019t 3, then don\u2019t think about whether the point is in the center or not.

Because dust particles are not cleaned by a vacuum cleaner, a dust collector is better than a vacuum cleaner in its ability to reduce dust accumulation in a room.\n\nInput: You are driving to the hospital but have to stop twice on the way.

The teacher, knowing that he is right, says to the student that some day he will be right. To prove that, he spends the next $25.50 on shoes and the teacher tells him about the shoes he bought.

I\u2019ve come to realize that natural selection can take place without a designer. Just because something works in the long run, doesn\u2019t mean God intended it to happen that way.\n\nIn terms of design, we must ask. Are there any design principles that are obvious to us, or are there rules and laws that we have not yet come to grips with?\n\nIn terms of evolution, we must ask. Why is this trait in the genetic code a good thing and this trait not in the genetic code?\n\nA designer does exist. The designer would be required to create the world He existed in, then to decide just what to do with it before His creation.\n\nSo, in that sense, we are only dealing with part of the creation story and the rest is unknowable. We will have to look to other sources for a better understanding of the story, and then to the wisdom and insight of the Creator Himself, to determine the rest of His purpose in the creation story.\n\nThat's a good perspective.. but I think it's also really hard for humans when they see the universe from \"outside\" and can't see the details that come into our everyday perception.\nWhen I try to see things in a broader, macro, world perspective and then use the microscopic detail to observe the world, I find that I actually do see some of the patterns and patterns in the complexity of the universe.\nIt's not very pleasant because then I have to make the decision that to be better than humans, that I must try to comprehend something that is beyond the reach of my limited vision.\n\nBut there may be a reason why there are two different ways for humans to understand the universe.\nWe don't know for sure which path God would like us on. We can choose to believe in Him and that would be one way to understand the universe that we will get out of that choice.\nBut, if we choose the negative option - that God doesn't exist and that He doesn't want any of our kind in the cosmos - then in that sense we will understand the universe as well, but it doesn't mean we would have", "answer": "C: garage"}

Choices: A: debt B: a job C: to live on his own D: a job\nOutput: A, B, and C\nMost people would think that A is the best way to get out of debt. Debt is a huge expense for many people. If a person wants to not have any debt, then they should put themselves first. They should always think about who is going to be on their debts (family, friends, people they know) and how they will pay for it. They should never choose to be at the mercy of their debtors. There is no such thing as a free ride. Most people think money is fun, but that doesn\u2019t make it free.\n\nThere are several steps that people will take to get out of debt and one of them is to pay off their debts as quickly as possible while being happy and healthy (see the previous answer where I said D). So if you have debt and you want to get out of debt fast, don\u2019t use a credit card to pay it off. You could be paying interest up until the day you finally pay off your debt, or it could take longer than that. If you have credit cards, it\u2019s better to look for an introductory interest rate. These interest rates are really short so you can pay it off in a month if you pay the bill on time and save yourself a bundle of interest that you\u2019ll have to pay in full for the rest of your life.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s a good idea to take a break in between paying off your debts. You could look for another job, see if you can go a few days without using credit, or just make an effort to use cash. It\u2019s good to remind yourself to use cash whenever possible and also go out more and spend more money. It\u2019s not good to pay more than necessary.\n\nInput: What do you think will happen about the", "answer": "C: that you"}

A double rose, with buds and blooms formed in two different groups.   A double double rose, in which each part of a rose flower is a double rose that bears a double flower, on opposite sides of a trunk of either a summer or winter rose.

Select all that apply:  A: porter B: scotch C: aria D: pinto E: latte F: creamer G: iced coffee H: iced latte\nOutput: iced Latte\nPorter Coffee was made from the roasted seed of the coffee plant. Porter is a form of coffee that is most commonly brown, but some varieties can be white. In Ireland, the Porter was made with malt malt, which is a malt that is roasted and then used in making beer. iced Latte was brewed with sweeteners that were added to the water to make it taste iced coffee. The name iced Latte comes from the fact that the beverage needed to be served immediately once it was brewed because the hot liquid was cold when it was served.\nPorter was first brewed in Dublin by a group of Irishmen that used the coffee plant to make iced coffee. Before this, Irishmen did not have coffee plants because of the strict laws that governed the sale of coffee to the Irish public. The coffee plants in Ireland made the perfect beans for iced coffee. They were easily available, easy to brew, and delicious. iced Latte became an Irish invention in the early 1800's. Before it was invented, a drink called iced coffee was made using hot water, sugar, coffee, and milk. The word iced latte is based off of the French words iced or lacerate meaning to cut or slice and latte meaning to slice or cut. Ireland's coffee industry would increase tremendously as the Irish coffee drinker evolved.\nPorter became a popular drink in the United States. The Porter is still consumed in the US, however, because of the higher cost, it doesn't stay very popular. In some areas, it is also known as New England Porter. Porter was known as New England coffee at the time. Today porter makes up less than ten percent of the market. Porter and many other types of coffee have gained popularity around the world because the coffee itself tastes good. Porter can be made with any type of coffee, any brand of coffee, and any type of milk. Porter is an excellent addition to coffee drinks because it is sweet and creamy, and it pairs well with many other products, including ice coffee.\n\nInput:\nYou can get 15 books through Mr. X.

For starters, I could not go into detail all the negative aspects of civil action. This would be too boring and pointless for everyone. On the other hand, I believe most people believe that civil action, like any other government agency, has no place in our society. Many believe that civil actions are the cause of problems rather than solutions. However, I feel there is an occasional role for government in certain instances. For example, if a group of people cannot cooperate with others or work together, it may be best to have government put a stop to some sort of conflict. I also believe the government has its role in civil action. If someone is being a difficult and disruptive person, that individual may well have a psychological conflict that needs to be worked out. Of course, this does not mean that the government should try to handle such situations. Instead, there should be mediation or arbitration.\n\nInput: A college professor tells a student that his future job title may be \u201cProfessor of Writing.\u201d What kind of job title would this student enjoy the most?

What is the height to milk?\nOutput: The water in the can of cat food is 16 \u00bd times the weight of milk.\nAnswer: One milk weight is 6 ounces. Two 1 ounce cans of cat food is 3 ounces. Three 2 ounce cans of cat food has an average weight of 8 ounces and there is a total of 20 ounces of milk and 9 cans in total. 10 ounces of the 25 oz. cans of milk weigh 8 ounces. Therefore two cans of cat food\u2019s weight is 16 \u00bd times that of the 25 oz. can of milk and 16 1/2 times the 9 ounces of milk plus another 8 ounces of cat food is 16 1/2 times that of the milk and 12 1/2 times the 4 1/2 ounce cans of cat food, thus, the total weight of the cat food is 42 1/2 times that that of milk.

Why? Example: I have two points A and B in a straight line. Time is measured in seconds. The distance between a point and a second from it is the length of a straight line. It is increasing in distance as time passes. Therefore, the straight line cannot shorten by the distance traveled simply by time. If the two points are not straight and the distance between them can\u2019t be increased then how does the distance increase?\nAnswer: The straight line cannot decrease simply by time. The distance between your two points is longer now than it ever has been. The straight line has not decreased because time has not taken a factor in increasing the distance between the two points. Therefore, I reject the hypothesis that this distance must decrease by the amount the time. The truth is that the length of the longest straight line is increasing as time passes but this increase in length is not a function of the change in time. Consequently, a straight line must not shorten as one passes the second point. To use a longer straight line to compare, I\u2019d better choose first point A since it is higher in the straight line than second point B. But the second point is moving away from me and is further away than first A. Therefore the second point cannot decrease as time passes. I still have the third point A for comparison since we used a longer straight line to start with. However the third point is moving away from second A and is closer than the first A. Therefore the third point cannot decrease as time progresses.\n\nInput:Which year did Paul become a Christian?

Explanation:\nOutput: The first will give you 100; the second will give you 150; and the third will give you 300. Now look at the prices. Only the clothing stores give you 100 for the clothes. It works out to $0.50 a piece. Now look at the dresses. The first one gives you one outfit for $5, the second gives you five outfits for $10, and the third is a $400 dress! This gives you three outfits for only $300!\nOutput: The second one gives you six outfits for $100. It would be $300.75, not $300. You only bought half of the dresses. So you only bought one outfit. Now why couldn\u2019t you have bought five outfits with the other 100 dollars?\nOutput: Since these dresses cost $300 one outfit for $300.75 is still equal to only 100.

{"text": "nothing because my brain doesn\u2019t work that way.\nHow is it that we can wake up? If you think about it, the body has to start working for you to wake up. It has to process what it smells, feels, tastes and sees. This makes it so that once your brain does not have enough signals, nothing happens. The only way your brain wakes up is if there is a signal from outside the body. In order to receive information from the body, you need an antenna or sensory organ. These parts, which look like hair and skin cells, are called sensory organs.\nThere are very specific parts of the body that will tell your brain about what happened. However, you only will get the information if your brain recognizes those areas. When the brain recognizes certain areas, it will start the process of sending signals. This will trigger the neurons in the brain. Once this process is completed, the brain should stop sending signals.\nIn order for the brain to wake up, it must send a signal to all the parts. The only different part that can get a message is the olfactory system. The olfactory system is a part that is in contact with almost everything that smells. The olfactory organ, which is the nose, smells. To process this information, your olfactory nerve sends signals to your brain. The result from the signal is when your brain creates the electrical signals. If there is a signal from the nose, brain will stop sending any electrical signals. Since the brain stopped sending electrical signals, the nerves will die off. This process is called an electrochemical shutdown.\nThe olfactory system is one of the first nerve systems that wakes up. If there is an electrical signal sent by the nose, the olfactory nerve will immediately pick up on it and start sending a message. This process also triggers an electrical response from your brain. This electrical response is when your brain creates an electrical signal, which results in the brain creating a neuron. This is how the brain gets more signals.\nBefore this electrical signal happens, there will be chemical reactions. The chemicals in the olfactory system trigger an electrical response. The electrical response will start the nerve cell activity. Some nerves have more activity than others, and when the nerve cells have more activity, there will be more electrical signals from the olfactory system and from your brain. These electrical signals will activate more neurons, and this is how they wakeup.\nThe process of waking up happens when your brain", "answer": "A: drink tea"}

The longer the atoms are, the heavier and slower they move.\nAn atom is usually a single piece that contains other pieces. Often, one piece is in the center and you can use different pieces to construct larger pieces.\nAn atom is a single atom. It has a nucleus and is made of the same atoms. That\u2019s why atoms are not made of \u201cchunks.\u201d An atom\u2019s molecules have exactly one of each and are not made of any other atoms.

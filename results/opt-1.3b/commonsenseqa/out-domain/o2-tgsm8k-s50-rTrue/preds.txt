It didn’t work the first time!” When Alice finished cleaning, Bob said, “Alice you did your best but couldn’t beat the washing machine.” Alice replied, “Actually, Bob, I have tried to beat it many times in the past but every time the washer wins.” He then proceeded to use his pan to beat the washer. They continued to exchange jokes for a while but both became serious with the situation: “Would you like some dessert?” Alice said, “Bob, can I give you dessert?” “Sure, I’d be thrilled!” they replied. Alice went inside and asked Bob to wait downstairs. But before she got down to the kitchen she asked Bob if he wanted any dessert on his hamburger steak. He replied, “Oh no!

Do you have any idea what kind of can you have? I’d like to know what kind of can you can have. You can eat with the jar lid down so that you can see the contents, but you cannot open it, until you bite into the food. The lid can also be pulled tight to keep the candy solid. However, if you’ve ever had a can of soda you know it is not edible. What is the lid made of? Does it have any holes? If so, they are small ones, that you’d never notice. They are probably big enough to fit the top edge of the lid. You can put a piece of bread in the jar to put some pressure on the lid. The lid will never be completely flat. There could be some slivers sticking up on the sides but you would never notice any holes on either side. Can I eat the food with the top of the lid down in order to help keep the cans of food in the jar solid? If you can, you could eat it on the way home. You may be able to eat it in one bite, but the lid can be pushed to the edge of the table by the force of gravity. If the lid is pushed so far to the edge that it sticks, then the can can’t stay in the jar. If it is not pushed far enough to stick, you will have food in your jar until it is empty. So, you can open it to find only a tiny amount of candy. Which of the following is NOT true: A) I don’t want my can of coke to go up in flames in the oven. B) I don’ t want my can of coffee to explode in the microwave. C) I don’'t want the cup of cereal to fall out of the box. D) I don't want my coke can to fall out of the refrigerator. E) After eating the food, I want it back at room temperature.<n>Output: The food in the jar will not go bad, even if it has been in the fridge for a little bit

It is said that if the homeless person is given $100 dollars after he breaks his bank account, he will eat food. You will find the dollar amount as:<n>Output: $100,000 x 50 = $50,000<n>However, if you are giving more than money, then you have to change the number of dollars into a different account. For example, if you give $150 to the poor person, he will eat and may need more money in the future. So, he needs $150,000 of your money or $10,000 of some other account or other. Therefore, you need to multiply the amount of money into at least 10 different accounts. For example, let's say you are giving 100 dollars to the homeless beggar. You will have $100,000 times the amount of money and add up the accounts<n>Result:<n>0 = $100,000<n>100,000 = $500,000<n>500,000 x 50 = 50,000<n>50,000 x 50 = 300,000<n>You can also multiply the number of different accounts into 100 and add them up.<n>100 x 50 = 200,000<n>200,000 x 50 = 600,000<n>600,000 x 50 = 1.5 million<n>So the final answer depends on the number of accounts you multiply. For example, if<n>0 = 0 - 100,000 = $100,000, then it has a total of 100<n>100,000 + 100 = 300,000<n>In this case, it has a total of 1.5 million<n>150 + 300 = 5,000,000<n>5,000,000 x 2,250,000 = $16 million<n>16 million divided by 2 thousand three hundred = $16.3 million<n>So the final number is $16<n><n>Input:The two sisters are standing in an empty room.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input:What do humans do when in a race?

Answer: 1.9% of white light is blue. So a black and white image gives approximately 1% less blue. So 1.9% of blue light is lost in the photo. 1% of 1.9% is lost due to the black and white picture. One can extrapolate this to about 200 more blue points compared to what a white image would give.<n>Output: 2.3% of white light is lost in a picture of black and white.<n>A 2.3% loss of total blue light is exactly one point on a 10mm focal length. A white photo of that intensity would take a 100mm lens, and that lens would only be able to resolve 20mm.<n>So the value of the black and white image would be two points less than a white image. Since a black and white image is an idealized representation, approximately, what percent of the total volume does a black and white image take up, depending on the distance between colors?<n>Answer: 2.3%<n>Output: 3.4%<n>Output:<n>Output:<n>Output<n>Output: A black and white photo taken from an aerial view with the camera oriented horizontally looks like a rainbow. The photo is not the same as the image. Some objects are lighter than others. How does the color balance change when the image is flipped upside down?<n>Answer: The light is spread around the image like the blue light would be. So the blue light is distributed evenly by the objects. This is exactly the same as the way that light reflects from an image, a normal photograph. But the way that light reflects off of an image is in a plane. If the image is flipped, the light pattern of the flipped image moves backwards. So the blue light pattern follows the plane around the flipped image. So the blue light intensity diminishes.<n>Output:<n>Output 1 = 2.4%<n>Output 2 = 3.1%<n>Output 3 = 5.9%<n>Output 4 = 14.1%<n>Output 5 = 35.1%<n>Output 6 = 54.7%<n>Output 7 = 79.7%

Toy A has a longer, thinner profile. And it’s much easier to hold Toy A than Toy B, which is longer, thicker, and harder to hold. A child who has grown into a mature adult has developed some sort of hand-eye coordination and arm-eye coordination to get both toys to fit in his hands. Children don’t tend to like toys that are too big, so they prefer toys that are longer and are better to hold, even if the toys inside are smaller.<n>Because Toy A has a shorter, thinner profile, and it was easier to hold it than Toy B, the child has learned how to use both toys properly, and he knows how many he can carry with him. Both toys can be carried in his pocket, and he has learned which is the “more comfortable” model<n><n>Input:There are 11 characters in a given list consisting of four letters and five numbers.

The number of steps in a dance class varies from person to person because different people have different abilities. The number of steps may vary from person to person because the human body responds differently to different stimuli and the way that a person moves to the music is also different.<n>The number of steps may vary because the human body responds different to different stimuli and the amount of steps may vary because people learn by example and the number of steps should be consistent from person to person.<n>The human body responds differently to all of these stimuli and the reason why we learn by example is also because we learn better by observing that we do the same things that others do and we tend to get frustrated by having problems with understanding things that other people do, so we learn by example rather than reading the manual or watching a video on the subject.<n>The number of hours that you spend learning will depend on the type of dance class that you take, there are certain dance classes that are better for certain people than others, for some people it may take three months of study to learn every choreography, for others, it may take only 6 weeks to learn how to break a certain choreography, and that’s normal depending on how long you need to review before you actually learn it. For example if you are studying classical ballet, you will probably take 3 months to study from the beginning, and if you are studying jazz or country western, the time frame may vary a little less, maybe 5-8 weeks.<n><n>Input:The answer to this question:

He asked if his mother would like to watch his son play college football. She never knew what to expect, so she said, “Okay, I’ll pick him up early.” The next day the mother picked her boy up at school but didn’t know what to expect. She tried to take him with her on a trip, but the coach of the son’s team refused to let her take her son while he was underaged. “Too risky,” he said. So the mother decided not to take her son. The next day, she picked him up at school. When the school opened, his mother got a call from a woman at the door asking if she could pick up her son. When she opened the door to him, he had left school. So, for the rest of the year, he would take a football practice from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day. “At first, my parents had a nice meal and enjoyed being with their son,” says the daughter. “But then the coach called and threatened to kick my dad out the game if his son didn’t move. They did kick him out, but a new player volunteered so that my dad could stay.” So, the daughter says, “My parents had a good time with the son they had for 10 years, but after that the coach put all the players into the football team. They now work like a crew and try to get everyone to help make the team wins. They say football is a bad sport – nobody gets hurt except the players.” So the daughter says her parents had a “bad time” playing a new sport<n><n>Output: None of them are in his age group.

So 63 is the total number of teams because 65/7 = <<65/7=54>>54.<n>In fact, 65 of them have won. But since Hurley only joined the team after joining the

The following is his statement:<n><n>"The Middle East crisis remains out of control, threatening the global security. The United States Government continues to press our elected representatives to help establish a stable and peaceful Middle East solution. We call on all countries - Muslim and non-Muslim - to unite in this cause and bring an end to the suffering to which so many people have been subjected over the last years. The United States will continue to make all necessary contacts and provide support for the process. I urge immediate implementation of UN resolutions and for the Arab leaders to support the Palestinian leadership in taking the measures necessary to achieve a just and lasting cease-fire and the start of negotiations. The United States does not seek a resolution that will undermine the will of the Palestinian people, or the aspirations of Israel's own people for greater freedom. The Israeli Prime Minister is now in Paris negotiating a cease-fire with Hamas, while the Israeli Ambassador is still in Washington lobbying hard for the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza which includes the implementation of all UN Security Council resolutions.<n><n>The United States wants a solution that will allow the Palestinian people to achieve an independent homeland and a viable independent state. We will support a peace process that guarantees the rights of Israelis and Palestinians and that is based on the UN resolutions and the pre-1967 borders. We call on the Israeli Government to stop harassing fishermen and farmers and to cease indiscriminate aerial bombardment that is destroying Gaza's infrastructure and creating tremendous loss of life. Hamas must be held to account for its war crimes if it will be called to account in any process. We must seek peace through negotiations

If the child cannot read for himself, then maybe the child would do better on tests by reading fewer pages. But this is not actually a charity.<n><n>It would be a lot better to say that it is a financial gain for the child. It is a way of incentivizing the child to study.

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n>Output:		 Inflation does not cause problems. It just pushes prices to the limit. If inflation is lower than the value of labor-owned assets, some people will sell their goods at face value and get free money (money that inflation takes from the owners), but the majority of owners will get nothing because their assets are always worth more than the price paid for them.<n>Input: Inflation is just food poisoning.<n>Output: If food poisoning causes people to stop buying food, they have to eat less food because you have to cook it, clean it up, and buy more of it. So there is less food available to everybody. And nobody eats more food because you need to cook it. So everybody is eating less food. So inflation does not cause food poisoning. But it does cause people to stop eating. And a lot of people stop eating because they do not have enough money and are hungry all the time because inflation is always increasing.<n>Input: People get shot after it rains, which causes food scarcity if it rains all the time.<n>Output: People get shot during all seasons, so water scarcity is normal.<n>Input: When you’re hot, you spend the day outside and avoid all cool-weather clothing.

And by doing the same thing all the time, food production increases. So there is more food on the market and people can eat more at lunchtime than they could during dinner time. So inflation is reduced.<n>Input: A person with money has more money because he has more time to invest in something that will generate income for him in the long run.<n>Output: A person with money earns more money because time and money are the same thing.<n>Input:A person has more money because he is smarter than everybody else.<n>Output:He has more knowledge and experience.

How will you determine the amount?<n>Output: The amount of money needed is 1.5. 1.5 + 1 – 1 = 1.5<n><n>Logic is defined as the use of reasoning to arrive at a given result. In solving the Rubik’s cube, logic is also considered when choosing the order you will solve the cube. In order to solve the cube you have to complete the left side first before you start to solve the right side. The reason that you would choose which order you solve the cube first is because the order a cube is seen in makes a difference when solving the cube. For example, the red cube has less corners than the blue cube. So, if we solve the red cube first, we would have a shorter run to make it through the corners. If we solve the blue cube first, we will have to make more trips through the corner to be able to get to the same amount of corners. For this reason we should solve the opposite cube first, as it allows us to easily determine how many corners we can get through. Once we solved the blue side, we would move on to solve the red side. It is more comfortable to solve the blue side first and skip the red side because it is easier. By skipping the red side, one can have a shorter run back to their starting point.<n><n>You will be asked to answer this many choice multiple choice problem in the form below.

When the man turns on the car, the ice from the food must be taken out of the freezer before the man can use it.<n>The ice is placed in the freezer in a friend’s vehicle driven by a woman. When the man turns the car on, the man must take out the ice from the freezer on the woman’s car.<n>How many items were placed in the freezer when the freezing occurred?<n><n>Input:The temperature of water is:  A: -3° C B: 17° C C: +3° C D: +2° C E: +0° C<n>Output:Water is ice crystals when it hits air. The freezing occurs when water hits air. When air is close to the freezing point, the water molecules freeze. When ice crystals have been grown on the air molecules, the water molecules become a solid and the ice crystals melt. When a liquid reaches +40° C or the liquid becomes +40° C for longer than 15 minutes, it turns solid. When ice crystals in water are present, the liquid freezes at room temperature. How long can the ice crystals grow on water when the water cools to +1° C or +2° C for longer than 10 minutes?<n><n>Input: If you put a knife into a bucket of water, the knife will:  A: get wet B: stick to the wooden surface C: snap as no knife can handle more than 1/4 turn D: bounce off the water as the knife is too big E: not float in water but sink<n>Output: The food knife that comes with your microwave is designed to slide in through a 2" hole in the bottom. It is a spring-loaded blade that can handle a small weight such as a marble or egg and slide out of the hole. When placed in a larger hole in the bottom, the spring-loaded blade can lift the food item off the surface. The food item does not have to be placed in the same hole twice in the same microwave. A larger hole in the bottom may produce better results. This is because the smaller hole is more effective in allowing the knife to slide through the larger hole. A larger hole will allow the knife to go in or out through the smaller hole in the same microwave. The knife is not designed to go through a small hole in a larger hole in a medium-sized microwave. The knife is designed to be

I’m not looking forward to getting married anytime soon." Then a stranger came up and said,"Sir, if you’d like to marry me, I’ll give you a $10,000 marriage grant.” Mr. K’s only comment was, "What a generous offer. I accept." Then the stranger said, "But don’t get me wrong, the first wife could be a real bitch if you’re bad. The second wife is very sweet, but if you’re not married and have money that fast, I have a friend who’s looking for a wife. His name is Big Joe. The problem is, Big Joe doesn’t have a great sense of humor. You see, Big Joe’s favorite line is, “I’m married, but I don’t have a wife!” I’m sure you get the picture!" Then Mr. K asked, "Wait, Mr. K, wasn’t it ‘second wife’? Did you really say ‘first wife’?" Mr. K replied, "No, the first wife is a bitch." Big Joe said, "Ahh… you must have misunderstood! Anyway, if you’re going to get married, I need a good woman! I need someone who is kind-hearted and a good housekeeper. I need a woman who loves dogs. I need someone who always takes her shoes off at the door. And I want a woman who is a good driver!" Mr. K began to worry that he was too picky. "My dear," he said, "I’d rather marry someone who doesn’t have an awesome sense of humor than do something just because she’s nice." Then the stranger said he could give him a woman who had a great sense of humor if he paid $1.

He was caught in a trap and was then sent outside. He was on the outside all alone and the food inside the box was rotting. A mouse named Ernie discovered him. Ernie invited Gert inside to eat. Then a rat named Scratty entered the box and destroyed the food. The rat had to be rescued by a mouse named Bert. After Scratty and Bert found each other, Scratty let the rest of the mice out. After they had eaten, one of the mice ran off to find other mice to eat. This led to several small mice running around the house and the rats began to worry. Since a mouse lives in a hole, they began to search for the mouse that was trapped in the hole.<n>The first mouse that they searched was an egg, which was immediately trapped in a hole. But once that was done, they went and searched for other eggs to be trapped in. After they had eaten many eggs, the rat named Ham thought that he came up with an idea: why not a mouse! So he thought up a clever trick: the mice were hidden in boxes. After Ham caught a mouse the first time, they began to think of what to do next. So they searched other holes until they finally found an egg that was being held together with duct tape. Ham told the mice about the egg and how it needed to be eaten. The next mouse who saw the egg came from the food in the boxes. The next mouse was also egg-shaped and took the egg which was held together by duct tape. After eating the egg, the mouse looked for another egg, but there were none. They thought of another idea: put it on your head and find it in a cave. After they had eaten several eggs, the rat named Gert thought of another idea: why not a trap! So he invented the first mouse trap and sent Ham to get the mouse. The next rat that got caught in the trap was an egg and another egg. The next mouse was in a box with a door on the inside. Ham sent the other rats out to eat the food found in the boxes and eat the mouse traps. The rat named Scratty thought that Ham needed to find food outside so he devised a new trap. So he hid the trap in boxes, which made rats think that the trap was only for food. But the rat named Bert was already on a trip; so Bert

One of the students is a female. The other three students are male. The male student skates into first place by two points, and the female skates into second place by two points. One of the female students scores another point for her team by coming in on the fast side of the ice. Can you do any of the following:<n>Output: In the individual event for women, the fastest female scores points by being on the fast side of Ice. If the female skates into first place, there will be no more points awarded for her team because the male skates into first place and scores more points. If the female skater comes in last on the fast side, there will be no way for her team to win. In a team event, the scores are added together to see who wins. There will be no points awarded to the first place female because she would not be on the fast side. Because of the female student’s performance in individual events, she will win the team event. In a team event for men, the fastest male scores points by being on a side of ice faster than the other competitors. If the male skates into third place, there will be an award for the third place female. In both individual events, women do not have the option of being on the fast side and in most team events, men have the option of skating on the fast side and not in the first place position because they are on the first team. So in order for the female student to score more team points than the other two, she would have to be on the fast side in both individual events and in the team event. If she were not on the fast side in an ice skating competition, she could not score any team points because she would not get the chance to skate on the fast side of ice.<n><n>Input:The following two women compete in a basketball tournament.

Pablo can you come?!” Pablo walks up to him and says: “Miss P!” As he gets closer he sees a large red balloon tied to rope attached to a swing near the path. He climbs the rope to the swing and is surprised at the height. He jumps to it, then throws himself onto it. He starts to swing it around, and Miss P and her group are all waiting at the bottom. She turns around and is surprised to see that he is not on the ground. “Oh, Pablo, what did you do out there?!”<n>In response, Pablo explains that he just sat on the swing, and when he saw her he shouted, “Miss, help me!” Miss P was so excited that she ran after him. They arrived at the bottom, where the instructor is standing. Pablo explained to Miss P that he fell off the swing and landed on a swing. She said that he had to find a way to get the balloon down safely. They both started looking for a rope. Miss P had a bucket full of water that was perfect for climbing the rope. Pablo tried to climb the rope around, but couldn’t make a good grab. One of Miss P’s balloons, however, was perfect for the task. She quickly pulled out the balloon and attached it to the rope. The balloon slowly floated to the top of the rope in two separate jumps, and Miss P pulled out another one to jump onto it. The balloon started spinning away from the center of the rope and Miss P jumped down, landing safely on the ground.

The father only helps with some things, and doesn’t do as much. So, in that way, mother and child are more independent.<n>So that means if a father and son are raised together, the son is more likely to be independent in later years. That isn’t really the answer. We want to take a look at what the role of the parents is in a child’s life, which means that father-child relationships have more of an impact on children than the actual father-mother relationship.<n>So, in this case, if you are the father, you have influence over your child, but that influence isn’t that substantial. If you are the mother, you have influence over them, but it’s not as important as it is for the father.<n><n>Input: Richard and Hurley are born on the same day in a family with 1 mother and 2 fathers.

The roommate’s roommate doesn’t want John to come outside because he has to use the bathroom. John runs outside instead. As he runs towards the bathroom, the roommate’s roommate throws down a shovel and walks directly at John. John moves in front of the roommate and blocks the shovel from reaching him. He then moves so he can see where the shovel is going to hit the roommate. When the shovel hits John, he hits his friend’s head. As John does this, his roommate gets angry and starts yelling. John picks up a spoon and shoves it in the roommate’s head. After that, John leaves. How did John and his friend respond to the situation?<n>Output: The roommate’s behavior is not appropriate to the situation. John made a self-provoked attack. A spoon can injure anyone, but it can’t injure the person John hit. So, the output is E.<n>This answer is incorrect because it leaves out the most important information.

In this situation, John would have reacted similarly to the roommate has he been in the condition the roommate was in.<n>Output: The roommate's behavior is unacceptable.<n><n>Input:In what year was Moses created?

Also, if it is too cold for the person to venture outdoors, he will become a target for predators.<n>2) Carry out all donations to shelters. This helps make sure everyone comes in as a regular person, not a charity case.<n>3) Don’t feed animals. This could easily be turned into an argument between a human versus a non-human animal.

Cats have very sensitive hearing and smell and this causes the animals a lot of pain as these problems result from a lack of nutrition.<n>5) When using the pet sitting services, be sure to check around town to see if any animals would like to be pets.

The answers given below:  A: self-study B: watching movies and TV shows C: watching video games D: playing video games E: reading books F: listening to lectures<n><n>The first question and answer is simple. It makes sense that the first answer is true. I am pretty sure that you will agree with me that the second answer is also true.<n><n>The third and fourth questions though are not so easy.<n><n>The answer of not enough time will help solve this problem but if you have to use something as a substitute you will have to think about how you can do that (and think about the solution to this problem) that will be a very interesting thing that you will learn. But the answer of inadequate school education will still not help solve the problem because that will take time and effort to do it. You may have to study, but it will be a boring or not easy thing to do, so don’t stress when you have to put that effort in to learn. The answer of self study though is a little bit harder to solve because it can be difficult to put in that effort, particularly if you don’t already like it or if it isn’t enjoyable to do. I think self study will help the most.<n><n>Let’s continue with the problem.<n><n>Input: What do children learn from stories? What does a book teach them?

When the brewery runs, he collects a portion of the money that is gathered and buys beer for his employees. During the day he collects and stores that beer. When he has too many bottles left, he brings them to the brewery and fills it with water and hops. At night, the beer can be stored in an underground vault or cellar. When the brewery closes, the beer must be stored, stored, or buried. The beer must be kept away from sight and from the public since it could contain chemicals or toxins, and can contain pathogens and bacteria, which make the beer unfit for human consumption. If the brewer were caught drinking at home, he would face jail and fines.<n>Before each brewing, the beer must be filtered, cleaned, chilled, and bottled. Each person in the brewery must sign a contract stating that the beer they make will not be for sale. As each individual brews their own beer, they have control over all of the ingredients and how much of the malt is used in each batch. The beer is also subject to regulations by the federal or state government. When the beer is at room temperature or slightly above, then it is ready to brew. After brewing, each bottle must be labeled and checked for quality. After brewing, the beer must go through a conditioning process, where it is sealed for a period of time until it is ready to be bottled or distributed. Once the beer is ready for distribution, it is poured into bottle and bottled according to the following: bottle, glass, plastic, cans, and kegs. After the beer is bottled, it must undergo an independent certification by the consumer. Once it is bottled, it must be stored and monitored until shipment to the customer. All of the steps required to brew and distribute beer are controlled by the government. When the person who owns the brewery decides to sell the beer, he is required to receive approval from the local or state regulatory agencies. He must then decide whether to sell it or not

C: B: D: C: D<n>Output: B<n><n>In physics, the chirped beam is a device in which the wavelength of infrared radiation passing through a sample is controlled. The objective is to reduce the number of photons falling in the same location within a specified time interval, usually measured in microseconds. A device is generally used to control the emission of a specified wavelength of infrared radiation at a certain time of the day. In order to control the wavelength of the light emitted, two waveguides are normally required. The wavelength of the light emitted from the second waveguide depends on the angle between an optically active material layer located between the first waveguide and the second waveguide. The material used to make the optically active material layer depends on the wavelength required, which usually ranges from about 420 nm to about 500 nm. In order to control their wavelength, the optically active materials can be combined either by superposition between two waveguides or through optical parametric optimization (OPO). Thus, chirped beam can be used for controlling the emission of infrared

Both angles are known and therefore 3 and 6 degrees north are equal in magnitude and therefore equal in the size of the sun.<n>2) There are 36 days and 30 hours in the year. Therefore 366 days and 365 hours are equal in this amount of time.<n>3) 365 days and 364 hours equal to 24 hours, therefore 24 hours x 365 = 36 hours.<n>4) The sun is rising or setting in the north or south. So the sun is not found to be at 2 degrees north at 4 minutes past 7 in the evening.<n>5) 365 days equals 360 hours so 1 hour and 1 minute equals 1 hours. Then 1 hour and 1 minute is equal to 1 hour and 55 minutes. Now 1 hour and 55 minutes equals 1 hour and 9 at the current instant. 1 hour 10 is equal to 1 hour 54 minutes and 3 hours 53 minutes.<n>6)

Most people don’t like the same movies twice. Not really a good reason but still…<n>3. On more than one occasion, someone has told me, “I didn’t find that movie as funny as the first viewing.” This is a definite yes<n><n>Input:The difference between 2 and 1 is 3 (2 x 1). (2 x 3 = 3). Does the answer to this question depend on the person whose hand the pencil is in during the equation?<n>Output: 2 x 1.<n>Not really. I always think of the value of a point when I draw using point or dot notation. The value of a point is a combination of its direction and the length of the edge. If the length of the edge is 1, then the value of the point is 1 plus 3. If the length of edge is.1, then the value of a point is.1 minus.01.<n>Also, this question is pretty simple to ask. You look at the question and the answer it gives to your question and you answer it. As long as the answer isn’t 3, then don’t think about whether the point is in the center or not. After you answer the question with the correct answer, you do not have to look at it again. Don’t give yourself

I’ve come to realize that natural selection can take place without a designer. Just because something works in the long run, doesn’t mean God intended it to happen that way.<n><n>In terms of design, we must ask. Are there any design principles that are obvious to us, or are there rules and laws that we have not yet come to grips with?<n><n>In terms of evolution, we must ask. Why is this trait in the genetic code a good thing and this trait not in the genetic code?<n><n>A designer does exist. The designer would be required to create the world He existed in, then to decide just what to do with it before His creation.<n><n>So, in that sense, we are only dealing with part of the creation story and the rest is unknowable. We will have to look to other sources for a better understanding of the story, and then to the wisdom and insight of the Creator Himself, to determine the rest of His purpose in the creation story.<n><n>That's a good perspective.. but I think it's also really hard for humans when they see the universe from "outside" and can't see the details that come into our everyday perception.<n>When I try to see things in a broader, macro, world perspective and then use the microscopic detail to observe the world, I find that I actually do see some of the patterns and patterns in the complexity of the universe.<n>It's not very pleasant because then I have to make the decision that to be better than humans, that I must try to comprehend something that is beyond the reach of my limited vision.<n><n>But there may be a reason why there are two different ways for humans to understand the universe.<n>We don't know for sure which path God would like us on.

A will probably choose food. As for B and E, we don’t know. D is a safe choice, and walking probably wouldn’t make him too happy but it would be something. You can tell that E is a good choice, since his shoes were dirty before he went to the market.<n><n>Input:What do you think is the best way to avoid debt is to work? Choices: A: debt B: a job C: to live on his own D: a job<n>Output: A, B, and C<n>Most people would think that A is the best way to get out of debt. Debt is a huge expense for many people. If a person wants to not have any debt, then they should put themselves first. They should always think about who is going to be on their debts (family, friends, people they know) and how they will pay for it. They should never choose to be at the mercy of their debtors. There is no such thing as a free ride. Most people think money is fun, but that doesn’t make it free.<n><n>There are several steps that people will take to get out of debt and one of them is to pay off their debts as quickly as possible while being happy and healthy (see the previous answer where I said D). So if you have debt and you want to get out of debt fast, don’t use a credit card to pay it off. You could be paying interest up until the day you finally pay off your debt, or it could take longer than that. If you have credit cards, it’s better to look for an introductory interest rate. These interest rates are really short so you can pay it off in a month if you pay the bill on time and save yourself a bundle of interest that you’ll have to pay in full for the rest of your life.<n><n>Sometimes it’s a good idea to take a break in between paying off your debts. You could look for another job, see if you can go a few days without using credit, or just make an effort to use cash. It’s good to remind yourself to use cash whenever possible and also go out more and spend more money. It’s not good to pay more than necessary.<n><n>Input: What do you think will happen about the

You should let the person know that you meant what you said, but not necessarily what you said. If you are talking with a person who doesn’t like the question or the answer that you have given, you should ask why they are saying something like that or ask them to clarify some of their opinion or their thoughts.

Choices:  A: acceptance B: rejection C: hope D: less sleep E: employment<n>Output:		 This is a tough one. If James is accepted, he could earn $500. He can leave home and work in the construction industry. He could get $200 for each day he works, so he would earn $500 for 3 days of work. Then he is also responsible for paying his tuition on the days he worked.<n>If they reject him, he feels rejected and might cry. He will probably also cry, if this is the case, he might also feel depressed for three days. If they accept him, he could earn $200 for two days. If he is successful, he could earn $400. He can leave home for work, as well, so he would earn another $700. Since he is still responsible for paying his tuition, he might earn at least $800 per month. Then he will earn $600 as an income just working in construction. If he fails to get the job, he can always quit his job and take a couple months off, or, if he is successful, he can take a job paying only $200 per month. If they don't hire him, he would still be able to stay at home for a little while and eat well without worry.

Choices:  A: botanic garden B: flower garden C: backyard D: supermarket E: outdoors<n>Output:		 B<n>A flower garden is for ordinary roses such as summer peonies, white-breasted larkspur, and dahlias. The garden should have two sections, the main one being a flowering bed filled with white-breasted larkspears, summer peonies, winter larkspur, and the like. You can grow your roses in pots or ground in containers. Other varieties would be more desirable. Try one of these:   A large, deep, deep red/purple rose.   A double rose, with buds and blooms formed in two different groups.   A double double rose, in which each part of a rose flower is a double rose that bears a double flower, on opposite sides of a trunk of either a summer or winter rose.   A hybrid rose, a rose that has a mix of the above colors as well as some other colors, such as red, purple or yellow.<n>A botanic garden is a field where ornamental plants are grown for their appearance only and used in gardens or as bedding plants. However, a botanic garden is not meant to be a full-fledged garden, but it may look like one. They use a mixture of different plants to produce some form of new plants. The common types of roses found in a botanic garden are the “dahlias,” “summer peonies” or “cactus roses,” along with some other species. You can also find some other types of roses growing or just planted in regular pots in the garden. You may grow your own roses at home, but you should look for roses that have more attractive foliage or flowers and better fragrance. You should look at how different varieties of roses smell, to see how pleasing they are to the senses.<n>A flower garden may be filled with flowers or other vegetables that attract birds to eat them. These may include:   Small summer peonies.   A large, upright winter peony.   A larkspur with white bracts.   A snowdrop in the spring.   A tall white peony with long, thin petals.<n>The following options are all acceptable, though please try to choose a different type of rose or garden type and flower, if possible.<n>1. A regular white peony is usually only one of a kind, with each peony having its own shape and size. Examples:   A double snowdrop.   A double summer

Select all that apply:  A: porter B: scotch C: aria D: pinto E: latte F: creamer G: iced coffee H: iced latte<n>Output: iced Latte<n>Porter Coffee was made from the roasted seed of the coffee plant. Porter is a form of coffee that is most commonly brown, but some varieties can be white. In Ireland, the Porter was made with malt malt, which is a malt that is roasted and then used in making beer. iced Latte was brewed with sweeteners that were added to the water to make it taste iced coffee. The name iced Latte comes from the fact that the beverage needed to be served immediately once it was brewed because the hot liquid was cold when it was served.<n>Porter was first brewed in Dublin by a group of Irishmen that used the coffee plant to make iced coffee. Before this, Irishmen did not have coffee plants because of the strict laws that governed the sale of coffee to the Irish public. The coffee plants in Ireland made the perfect beans for iced coffee. They were easily available, easy to brew, and delicious. iced Latte became an Irish invention in the early 1800's. Before it was invented, a drink called iced coffee was made using hot water, sugar, coffee, and milk. The word iced latte is based off of the French words iced or lacerate meaning to cut or slice and latte meaning to slice or cut. Ireland's coffee industry would increase tremendously as the Irish coffee drinker evolved.<n>Porter became a popular drink in the United States. The Porter is still consumed in the US, however, because of the higher cost, it doesn't stay very popular. In some areas, it is also known as New England Porter. Porter was known as New England coffee at the time. Today porter makes up less than ten percent of the market. Porter and many other types of coffee have gained popularity around the world because the coffee itself tastes good. Porter can be made with any type of coffee, any brand of coffee, and any type of milk. Porter is an excellent addition to coffee drinks because it is sweet and creamy, and it pairs well with many other products, including ice coffee.<n><n>Input:<n>You can get 15 books through Mr. X.

Choices:  •What would make this assignment helpful: Your writing style. •How can teachers use it: For your next composition project. •How would your students use it: For their next composition project. •Would the reader still be effective in understanding this assignment: After he wrote this essay, you would expect your reader to take your statement seriously and find a way to learn something from the content.<n><n>Response: The purpose of the assignment is to show my opinion on civil action. For starters, I could not go into detail all the negative aspects of civil action. This would be too boring and pointless for everyone. On the other hand, I believe most people believe that civil action, like any other government agency, has no place in our society. Many believe that civil actions are the cause of problems rather than solutions. However, I feel there is an occasional role for government in certain instances. For example, if a group of people cannot cooperate with others or work together, it may be best to have government put a stop to some sort of conflict.

Instead, there should be mediation or arbitration.<n><n>Input: A college professor tells a student that his future job title may be “Professor of Writing.” What kind of job title would this student enjoy the most?

Fill five 2 liter milk jars with water and add 2 cans of cat food. The total weight of the milk is 35 pounds. What is the height to milk?<n>Output: The water in the can of cat food is 16 ½ times the weight of milk.<n>Answer: One milk weight is 6 ounces. Two 1 ounce cans of cat food is 3 ounces. Three 2 ounce cans of cat food has an average weight of 8 ounces and there is a total of 20 ounces of milk and 9 cans in total. 10 ounces of the 25 oz. cans of milk weigh 8 ounces. Therefore two cans of cat food’s weight is 16 ½ times that of the 25 oz. can of milk and 16 1/2 times the 9 ounces of milk plus another 8 ounces of cat food is 16 1/2 times that of the milk and 12 1/2 times the 4 1/2 ounce cans of cat food, thus, the total weight of the cat food is 42 1/2 times that that of milk. This calculation gives a total height of 18 ½ inches so that the height of the milk is 8 – 18 = 3 ½<n><n>Input: A child named Bill has a cat named Kitty.

Why? Example: I have two points A and B in a straight line. Time is measured in seconds. The distance between a point and a second from it is the length of a straight line. It is increasing in distance as time passes. Therefore, the straight line cannot shorten by the distance traveled simply by time. If the two points are not straight and the distance between them can’t be increased then how does the distance increase?<n>Answer: The straight line cannot decrease simply by time. The distance between your two points is longer now than it ever has been. The straight line has not decreased because time has not taken a factor in increasing the distance between the two points. Therefore, I reject the hypothesis that this distance must decrease by the amount the time. The truth is that the length of the longest straight line is increasing as time passes but this increase in length is not a function of the change in time. Consequently, a straight line must not shorten as one passes the second point. To use a longer straight line to compare, I’d better choose first point A since it is higher in the straight line than second point B. But the second point is moving away from me and is further away than first A. Therefore the second point cannot decrease as time passes. I still have the third point A for comparison since we used a longer straight line to start with. However the third point is moving away from second A and is closer than the first A. Therefore the third point cannot decrease as time progresses.<n><n>Input:Which year did Paul become a Christian?

First you choose from two colors, and then you choose one dress. This time you will need ten dollars for clothing. Which would you choose? Explanation:<n>Output: The first will give you 100; the second will give you 150; and the third will give you 300. Now look at the prices. Only the clothing stores give you 100 for the clothes. It works out to $0.50 a piece. Now look at the dresses. The first one gives you one outfit for $5, the second gives you five outfits for $10, and the third is a $400 dress! This gives you three outfits for only $300!<n>Output: The second one gives you six outfits for $100. It would be $300.75, not $300. You only bought half of the dresses. So you only bought one outfit.

Choices:  A: drink tea B: thank god C: open eyes D: feel angry E: complete sentence<n>Output:		 nothing because my brain doesn’t work that way.<n>How is it that we can wake up? If you think about it, the body has to start working for you to wake up. It has to process what it smells, feels, tastes and sees. This makes it so that once your brain does not have enough signals, nothing happens. The only way your brain wakes up is if there is a signal from outside the body. In order to receive information from the body, you need an antenna or sensory organ. These parts, which look like hair and skin cells, are called sensory organs.<n>There are very specific parts of the body that will tell your brain about what happened. However, you only will get the information if your brain recognizes those areas. When the brain recognizes certain areas, it will start the process of sending signals. This will trigger the neurons in the brain. Once this process is completed, the brain should stop sending signals.<n>In order for the brain to wake up, it must send a signal to all the parts. The only different part that can get a message is the olfactory system. The olfactory system is a part that is in contact with almost everything that smells. The olfactory organ, which is the nose, smells. To process this information, your olfactory nerve sends signals to your brain. The result from the signal is when your brain creates the electrical signals. If there is a signal from the nose, brain will stop sending any electrical signals. Since the brain stopped sending electrical signals, the nerves will die off. This process is called an electrochemical shutdown.<n>The olfactory system is one of the first nerve systems that wakes up. If there is an electrical signal sent by the nose, the olfactory nerve will immediately pick up on it and start sending a message. This process also triggers an electrical response from your brain. This electrical response is when your brain creates an electrical signal, which results in the brain creating a neuron. This is how the brain gets more signals.<n>Before this electrical signal happens, there will be chemical reactions. The chemicals in the olfactory system trigger an electrical response. The electrical response will start the nerve cell activity. Some nerves have more activity than others, and when the nerve cells have more activity, there will be more electrical signals from the olfactory system and from your brain. These electrical signals will activate more neurons, and this is how they wakeup.<n>The process of waking up happens when your brain

The father agrees to take 3 million dollars and the mother pays 5 million dollars for the rest. Is this a fair trade, and if so, how does it work?<n>Output: Yes. Even though the father takes less money, because he and the mother plan to spend more on the childbirth, they both gain. The woman learns that she needs to have an intervention if she doesn’t want her baby to die. The father learns that the baby was not supposed to be alive.

Choices:  A: crash B: living C: slow down D: carry people E: speed up<n>Output:		 C = <<1/12>>1/12<n>Aircraft use a cabin because the passengers must all be seated together because the air is too warm for two people. If a passenger were to want to sit on his own or in a window seat, they would not be able to do so because there would be some turbulence, and passengers would not be able to keep their feet on the seat. There is a safety feature in the airplane that will slow the aircraft down by slowing down cabin air pressure. If the passenger wanted more room than the cabin air pressure would provide, they would be able to put their feet on the seat, which would help them. It is the cabin air pressure that slows the airplane down. The cabin air pressure of an airplane should be between 3 and 4 inches per cubic foot.<n><n>Input: A group of students were given $100 to buy something for themselves. Each of them needed two different things: clothes and shoes. One student decided to buy shoes. He bought a pair of dress shoes that had a narrow fit for men and a wide one size for women. The other student wanted three different kinds of shoe, so they decided they would buy shoes different sizes than those two. The total cost each customer paid for his shoes was $160. What is the difference between the cost of the shoes ($160 per student) and the cost of the shoes for the person who bought them ($40 per student)?<n>Output: $40 * 3 = $480<n>The shoes for both students cost less than $50 which is the same as the shoes they bought because the shoes were for different sizes. The only difference in the shoes is that one of the sizes was for men and the other was for women. There is not a safety feature in the shoes to slow the aircraft down because the safety feature in the shoes is only for wide sizes.<n><n>Input:What does a human brain do with all of the time it has available?

Choices:  A: atom B: anything C: air D: feet E: hands<n>Output:		 An atom is a collection of atoms. They have exactly one atom each or none at all.<n>An atom should be considered a compound. It’s not a monolith. They are not all the same length! The longer the atoms are, the heavier and slower they move.<n>An atom is usually a single piece that contains other pieces. Often, one piece is in the center and you can use different pieces to construct larger pieces.<n>An atom is a single atom. It has a nucleus and is made of the same atoms. That’s why atoms are not made of “chunks.” An atom’s molecules have exactly one of each and are not made of any other atoms. Inorganic molecules are made of only one kind of atom, usually carbon.<n>An atom is made of atoms that are equal in mass and have the same number of atoms. That means each atom is equal to exactly one atom in other atoms.<n><n>Input: An atom contains just one electron. How many is that? Output: One is not exactly one.<n>Each electron has two “positions.” It either has an electron or a hole. A hole is a place where an electron cannot be. But it also cannot fill the hole. It is a vacuum.<n>Each electron has four other electrons. They can also be called electron ions.<n>The total number of electrons in an atom is.001*(anatomic mass – electron mass) = 1/(anatomic mass–electron mass). This is called its chemical mass.<n>The total number from this is 1/(anatomic mass – atomic mass). This is called the “structure” of the atom.<n><n>Input:A single electron can have two different roles. How many can that electron have? Output: Each of these roles must be filled. This would mean that the electron can occupy no more than one of the four possibilities given. If the electron can not occupy the role of any of its four possibilities, it will be a vacancy. If the electron can occupy only one of these four positions, it will be a double electron. That is an atom.<n>Input: The number of electrons in an atomic atomic mass is.005. What is the mass of a single atom?<n>Output: An atom has exactly one atom at any moment. You will never see an atom composed of more than one atom. The one atom is always the same. They all have the same atomic mass.<n><n>

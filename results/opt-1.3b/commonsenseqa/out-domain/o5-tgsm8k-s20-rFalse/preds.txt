The grandfather said, “Now doctor, I want you to write me a note telling me that I have a death sentence - and I will take that on your word.” The doctor replied, “Well grandpa, that won't be necessary." The grandfather replied, “No sir, that is necessary.” He said, "You, doctor, have been a terrific doctor. But now I can die without regret. Thank you. Take care, and God bless you.” The doctor turned around. "Grandpa," he said, "it is all your fault. What did I tell you about smoking, drinking and taking too much exercise?"

It's a blessing for me to go before you.” ”Well, then," said the doctor, "we’ll make an arrangement. I will prescribe to you. And if you die, your funeral will be free.” The grandfather said, ‘How about that?’ The doctor said, ‘That’s right. If one dies and another lives, it will be no charge.’ The grandfather said, ’Very well then,’ he said and added, “Don’t forget to write my death sentence on the prescription.”<n><n>Input: A woman who worked for 45 years at the same company decided that she wished to retire after 45 years at the same job.

Therefore, the money they will earn over the next 3 weeks has the dollar amount: $90 + $5<n>Output: $79.50 x 3 weeks = $3,099.50<n><n>Input:This person's salary is $1.50 more per hour than she worked a year ago, and that is because the employer cut her salary to $2.80. She still works 10 hours a week. But she has to pay $3 per day to have someone else come in to do her job. Since the extra time spent outside of work costs 2.5 hours each month, the total cost of her job is $5 instead of $2. She is now at a loss for hours and for money. Therefore, the job costs $5 rather than $3, that is, the additional $3 per month in extra money (2.5 hours + 1 per month) she does not have is lost. But now, she has to pay more to have someone else come to her job because she cannot work fast enough. Therefore, the additional 2.5 hours of work she has to do will cost her more, that is, the extra 2.5 hours + 1 hour she does per month (she can only work at a slower rate as everyone is already paying more and thus it is more expensive to hire someone additional then she is currently). So what would this person do?<n>Output: none<n>Example:<n><n>Input:You are offered $4 an hour to work as a maid for someone who is spending a lot of money on cleaning services.

How much time and money will you spend as a maid?<n>Output: $20<n><n>Input:The number of different products on every shelf

When he is at the house, he buys the birdhouses for his birds. He then drives the birds back and forth to every other birdhouse store that people sell birdhouses to and sells all of their birds for one big fee of $10,000. This guy is very rich because he is making enough bird houses to buy a new truck.<n>Input: The stock market crashed on New Year’s Eve of 1990. It had dropped all the way through the year and this affected everyone. What did everyone do? Why?<n>Output: When the stock market collapsed, the whole country wanted to cash in for the losses. Many people went into debt. These companies bought back a lot of stock. There was no one left to buy the stock and so the stock price dropped back down to the levels it was before the collapse. On the other hand, the people who were not in debt were excited because a new high had been hit. They felt that they were finally making money. When they heard that the prices of many things had dropped they got very excited. This then caused the price of stock to drop lower and lower to eventually reach the levels seen before the crash. Many people who were in debt had lost enough money that they could no longer take on any more debt. At that time the prices of things were very high and the people lost everything they could afford. This caused the price of most things to drop tremendously.<n>Conclusion: Stock crashed, everybody lost, everybody was happy that everybody was having an awesome time.<n><n>Input:Tapanga and Brian have 60 candies together.

There was no electricity at the time and the light was made by oil lamps. Two young men were in residence in the tavern at this time. The age of the two men is unknown. One was called Cesare and the other was called Michelangelo. They drank heavily every evening until the day came that Cesare died. By mid-night the light bulbs in the tavern were burnt through. The landlord, having heard of the situation, sent a priest to the tavern to pray over it as he couldn't pay for the repairs. The priest was called St. Crispin and arrived at the tavern about half an hour later. The priest was surprised that the house was without electricity. Michelangelo was the first to see the smoke. He ran outside, calling out to the boys who had been in the tavern all evening of their father's death. Unfortunately he hadn't been quick enough. When it became clear that the fire had already been established, St. Crispin went to call for help while Michelangelo climbed up to the roof of the tavern shouting for help. A nearby tavern keeper saw the boys and came outside to lend a helping hand. St. Crispin and Michelangelo ran across the back of the tavern and made it on the roof while the others ran to help. When St. Crispin arrived on the roof, he was surprised to see his two friends dead on the outside of the building while in flames on the inside. St. Crispin then made his way down to the ground level via the attic and, while using his light to illuminate the fire, he was able to rescue the two friends by climbing up onto their heads. The two friends then were taken to the local hospital for treatment. They had died from smoke inhalation. St. Crispin was taken to the local hospital as well. After being treated by the local doctor, St. Crispin was placed in quarantine at the hospital for observation. The two boys had died because of an electrical fire caused by their poor maintenance of the tavern. St. Crispin has been charged with manslaughter. The two boys had been drunk and carelessly handled the power supply of their father's tavern, which caused a fatal electrical fire. St. Crispin is still receiving treatment at the hospital. The townspeople believe that St. Crispin was a good man and that his punishment is unjust.<n><n>Input:John went to the hospital

There are 5 villages in total, each with 9 children. All animals who pass through must have permission from the elders or their leader before they can come into the village. The elder who is the leading authority in each village will be notified if the animal is going to the village outside of the boundaries. Children born and raised in each village may move to another village without prior permission. When they reach puberty, the villagers will sign the permission documents. On Saturday, every child who is not a relative of an elder or the village leader will be given permission to move from village one to village two. When a child's parent is not nearby to sign, the child must find someone who is available to sign on their behalf. In a village where two or more elders can not come together by themselves, villages two and three are always combined. In each village two and three, the children may only go to and from the village one. In every village two and three there is a curfew; children may not come out after school or after noon on the weekends. After all children have been given permission, animals may be released. When an animal has been released, it is then released to the village elders. As long as this animal is not on city property, it is not considered illegal to release it to the elders. There is sometimes a fee for each animal; fees differ depending on the time of year, how many animals are present, and whether it is a city animal or a village animal. There are three levels of penalties for releasing an animal. Level one is the lowest; only children who were not previously given permission will receive this level of punishment. Level two is the highest; children will be suspended from the village for two weeks when they are found to have released an animal without permission. Level three is the final level; the child will be transferred out of the village for three weeks. Level one only applies to animals who pass through the village; children who go to and from the villages outside of the borders are not required to get permission from village elders. Level two does not apply to animals that are caught wandering outside the village boundaries. Level three does not apply to children who have accidentally released a animal. Level seven, once a village has passed through three times and has received permission from village elders, children may move to a village outside of the village boundaries. Level eight applies to children who have deliberately released an

During the car ride home, Barbara tells Mark he should cut the hole out, but Mark says he won't, because he is afraid of being "the jerk that puts a hole in something." They reach their destination and Mark cuts the hole in the cake. Barbara, surprised, calls her dad. They stop at several gas stations and Mark explains what happened. Dad calls home and tells Barbara that Mark was a jerk. Barbara asks if her dad likes boys, and he says he doesn't (and that he has never heard of anyone who did that.) Barbara asks Mark what he is doing that night with his friends and he says he is "playing with the cars" and that he will not tell her why. Barbara reminds her dad about this incident but he says he knows Mark is really sorry, and so he won't tell her why. Barbara tells her parents that Mark said he didn't cut the hole in the cake just for fun and that maybe it wasn't funny for Mark, but Barbara is sorry her dad was upset about this. Barbara tells her aunt, who says Barbara was right. Mark goes back to the house alone. A short time later, Mark tells Barbara he wants her to drive him home (their destination is across the street) so they can watch a movie. (For each day of driving, a letter = one year.) Barbara agrees to drive to Mark's house. They arrive and they talk for hours while Mark drives. Late that night, Mark apologizes to Barbara and tells her he thinks of her and he loves her, and Barbara says she loves Mark too, but then says she will leave.

Two children are given homework, and all the other children do no work at all. How many homeworkers get assigned work? How many workers? Let's look at the data. Assume 100 students have their homework sheets. Assume 50 work. Assume 30 no homework. Assume 10 workers and 30 do no work. Assume 2 workers with no tasks.<n>Input: [6.0*100 = 3.2 = 9.4]<n>Output:  0<n><n>Input:The number of students in a class is 18. Assume no homework. It takes two students one hour to complete their assigned works, so 1 hour x 24 = 9.4 hour.

You find that since all the problems will be assigned that your problem list will take up a total of 25 sheets. Since each student will work on 5 worksheets a week, then each week the total number of worksheets you will need would be 50. You could divide 75 for 50, if you wanted less work for the week. But, since the worksheets don't take up this much sheet space, then you need just 45 sheets. How many students do you have?<n>Output: 30<n><n>Input:Mary has 9

Input:  A: rainy B: sunny C: clouds D: sunny<n>Output: D sunny C rainy B A A D<n><n>The correct answer to the question is B. However each answer has one correct answer.<n><n>1. What is the first law of thermodynamics?<n><n>(a) "First comes first serve. Then goes first"<n>(b) "Thermodynamics should be a third party"<n>(c) "Thermodynamics are not applicable in non-living systems"<n>(d) "Thermodynamics is not a law"<n><n>Solution - Choose your answer carefully<n><n>1. The 1st law of thermodynamics describes an ideal system where every molecule is in constant motion. All motion is uniform, and there is no energy or matter in motion. Each molecule has equal kinetic energy. Therefore, one must maintain constant temperature, or heat, in order for all motion to be thermodynamically uniform. Therefore, thermodynamic uniformity requires that every system be stable with the same entropy. Therefore, if a system's dynamics are not perfect because of imperfections in its structure, it can not be considered thermodynamically uniform.<n><n>This is correct.<n><n>2. It is impossible for a thermodynamic system to exist where every molecule in motion has the same amount of kinetic energy. The 1st law cannot be violated.<n><n>Solution - Choose Your answer carefully<n><n>3. The second law of thermodynamics applies when certain systems become non-uniform (i.e. all molecules have different amounts of kinetic energy) because of imperfections in the system.<n><n>Solution - choose your answer carefully<n><n>4. The second law of thermal motion describes an ideal system where not all molecules (or atoms) are in constant motion. In such a system, each molecule, or atom, has its own set of kinetic energy. Therefore, the rate of energy transfer among molecules or atoms will change. When these change occur it is called thermal motion, and the second law no longer applies.<n><n>This is incorrect.<n><n>5. The 3rd law of thermodynamics states that change is not reversible. All systems cannot come back to their initial state. Each system has a fixed entropy because of its fixed thermal motion. Therefore, changes to a thermodynamic system cannot happen.<n><n>Solution -Choose your answer carefully<n><n>Answer these questions

Dancing<n><n>You have three different questions. What must be answered to select the correct answer?<n>Answer: A. Opera B. Cinema. Every opera house has at least 8 performances a week. Only a handful of people come to an opera show, so there are no new audiences to attract.<n>C. Party.. There are 1-2 people at a party, so everyone is always present at the party. So if there is a party, you are not attending.<n>D. Show on stage.. The people dancing are all strangers.<n>E. Dancing. If no one is in the audience, or dancing by themselves, then dancing is not available at the party.<n><n>All 3 of these questions are correct.<n>Which response was the correct answer?<n><n>A. Opera B. Cinema C. Party D. Show on stage E. Dancing<n><n>Answer<n><n>A. Opera<n><n>The correct answer is...<n><n>A<n><n>Answer :<n><n>1 point awarded for each correct choice.<n><n>Note : A) Cinema is playing a new movie, so there are some people in the audience who are not old enough to have been to the opera before and don’t know any of the songs. Also there are new people there to whom dancing is not available. That could be what is confusing you most about the opera. B) If it’s a Party, where everyone is at the party, and therefore not all the people in the party would have the same level of experience, then the opera would be a strange way to end the party. Because people would then have to interact with strangers, dancing at the party could be a

Each person works 7 hours per day. How hard, on average, do all 40 people work to pay for the restaurant's overhead?<n>Output: 45<n><n>Input: There was once a boy named John who was always late for his classes. His parents felt that was because he was a mischievous little kid, so they disciplined him by taking him to the principal's office. The principal would then tell John that he could no longer walk to school because he really meant to be up on time.  John was very angry when he got home.  He started to punch the walls, threw the windows out of the house and broke the light fixtures.  His parents took him to the doctor and told him he had to go to an outside doctor for his condition.  Then instead of getting to the doctor, John got into his family's car and drove down to his father's house instead. He ended up hitting his mom in the face with a frying pan as they drove away.  His dad had to buy new clothes for him at the laundromat because he looked so dirty. John spent the next 6 years in prison, where he was forced to live as a dog. When he finally had a chance to pay, the prison gave the prison $1.00 per year to help him pay for his cell and food and clothing that he was not allowed to pay for while in prison. The prison didn't like him paying for things by breaking their stuff, so they stopped paying him.  The prison finally let him out after 6 years, when his son moved out from home, where he was raised. In the outside world, he immediately got a job and got to college. His son decided to go to college too though and stayed.  When he was growing up, his father would often tell him not to worry about being on time because the most that was always on his mind was his homework.  Now, in college, his son can be on time for everything and even is on time for some of his classes.   When the teacher is done teaching, students are free to leave their workstation and start working on other projects. This gives time to the teacher to spend with their students during the final exam and allows the teacher an extra time when the final exam is being given so they can spend more time with students to help with their problems.  So now when John gets to his class, he has time to ask about

To learn more about this activity, see the lesson "Five Questions."<n><n>In this activity students complete what they could and had to use their imagination. What they did is to collect a random amount (from one dollar) and try to give it to the person they felt should have it. One student said he thought if they "feel good about how you did it, you might get paid a little extra." (See Lesson: Four Tips for Generous Giving.) When using an app, students can earn coins, but when students were asked for their opinions about this, they disagreed. Some said that "it's better to give more money," and "you should never pay someone more than your true worth." (See Lesson 13 for more on giving.)<n><n>In this activity both students choose an item from the gift bags that are being made. Then they choose what item to buy. Students then put the items in a bag, and one student says that they need the money so that "they can use it or return it." When the student tells another student that they will buy a treat, the other student says that "I think they should spend it." The student that purchased the treat is then given the money, and they have to spend it in one place - which is not really buying the treat or using it. (See Lesson 3 on Giving.)<n><n>This activity uses an online app, so students can earn, spend, and spend. What happens is that students can spend money by entering their information so that someone they feel they should give money to gets more money. The idea is that students can feel good about themselves when they spend it, because "your time has to feel good if we're suppose to feel good about giving." (See Lesson 20 on Generous Giving.)<n><n>In this lesson, students select the person they want to give money to. Then the student picks a friend and gives them money. The student that receives the money can use it, and they can buy a gift for their friend. The student that receives doesn't have to use the money immediately because they can wait until the end of the year, when they should spend/give the money. (See Lesson 18 on What to Do When You Receive Money.)<n><n>After reading: "Catch Your Breath," students made this to hold and say "I'm thirsty." Students thought about the

Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n>Output:		 D<n><n>Answer a)<n>B<n>C<n>E<n>D<n><n>Solution 1<n>An invitro baby is only made when two eggs from the same clutch are fertilized, and then one of the eggs inside the fertilized egg is carried to term.<n><n>Explanation: For every egg fertilized by a sperm cell, the resulting fertilized egg contains one cyte. The cyte can be any cell found in a human. At one time, it's a part of your body, but in most of the world, it's a part your body does not use, so it can be anywhere in the body. If fertilized by a sperm, an egg contains an oocyte, and the resulting egg contains a zygote. The zygote is a part of your body that already exists in almost all of the world, and is already a part of your body. If fertilized with a human sperm, the resulting sperm cell would contain 1 cyte.<n><n>If the zygote does not turn out to be a cyst, some scientists believe that it can develop into a new zygote. If it does not, it's not born. Therefore, if the zygote developed normally, there would still be two eggs in the nucleus of the egg.<n><n>Solution 2<n>An invitro embryo is formed only if two eggs are fertilized on the same day by the same human sperm cell. Because two eggs develop on the same day and by the same same sperm, only one egg would remain in the embryo and it would be a normal egg.<n><n>Explanations Explanations:<n>If only one egg developes (i.e. the nucleus of the egg is empty), there is no egg inside it. If the nucleus grows (i.e. a cyst forms), the zygote must have three cysts already. If there are multiple cysts in the Zygote, the result would be a zygote with only one cyst inside it. That zygote would not be a normal egg, it would never take its place in the body of a human. The cyft (zygote) inside it would just be something a little off.<n><n>Solution 3<n>If both eggs are fertilized by different sperm cells, the resulting zygote contains only one cyst in the zygote. Although the egg in this case contains a zygote, the zygote contains only 1 cyst. Therefore,

This cost Jane 1/2 hour of her father's time. Jane can spend $100 on repairs or money on food, but she can't spend $50 on repairs and $60 on food. She can't spend $100 because her father is a mechanic, and because every penny buys a second chance at her father. She can spend money on her father because the repair needed money on supplies. When Jane's father bought the boat, 1/3 of the money went to pay for the boat. On Monday he found the boat had broken down again. The remaining money was spent on supplies. If Jane bought the repairs, her father would be out that day's money plus any money from the repair. On the other hand, if she did no repairs to the boat, she would save time and money by not spending 50 dollars on repairs and $90 on food. Jane can work both of the options and still manage to have enough money to get out of the house. She can also spend less money if she spends only $50 on repairs but a lot on food. But she can also still do both of the options and not have to deal with the problems of one or the other.

Their car stopped a few times to pick some folks up and had dinner. After dinner a truck pulled up that had the same lady that had come earlier all the way there.

At dinner that night, Freddy asked if he could have a beer. When Freddy went outside, he saw a young black man sitting on the porch of a house. After a while, Freddy asked the man, "Hey, could you give me a beer?" The man answered, "I don't want one. I already had one. What's wrong with you? Why do you need two beers?" Freddy responded, "I don't need two beers. I just wanted a beer. But you did that before I could. Can you change your mind?" The man agreed to change his mind.

When he returned to his car, he had a problem. His beer disappeared. Freddy returned to his friend's house and told him about how hard his day was, and that he deserved a beer.

Is that what you’re saying?” “Yes, I think that’s right.” “What do you want me to say? Are you saying that if a man has a wife under 70 he’s out there looking for sex all day? Are you saying that any man who has daughters is out there looking for sex every second of every day?” “I believe that women are capable of loving men as much as men love women. That they don’t need to be taken care of all the time.” “Mary, that’s true. I can love my wife all the days of the week.” “But it’s not the same for all marriages. Some people are able to manage. Some, like you, know they are the happiest when they’re doing well in their career.” “That’s fine. I’m happy with what I have going here. But I want the world to know that many marriages end because women aren’t taking care of themselves.” “Like I said, they don’t. Some people live a long time if they make sure to do their own laundry, take their own food to work or pick up their children for school and bring them back to their home.” “So let’s leave this alone.” “And what would happen if the men in our families let their wives take care of them?” “They would go their whole lives trying to find a way to make it better?” “Not everybody does that. People don’t have that same option.” “

Now, suppose he wanted to double his original $200 bet. It will cost $40 to double it, plus the $20 so he owes $60 instead. So, how about if the guy only needed to double his bet?

We have to know more about how the world works. 2. Intelligence. We have to have that innate capability which enables us to think on our toes. It’s a combination of the intellect and the emotional capabilities. 3. Education. We go to school. We educate ourselves about things. We learn from others and from our experiences. When we go to school, we become a better person from that experience. 4. Intelligence (mathematics 1). The brain must be functioning at one thousand percent efficiency. 5. Education (math 2). The brain produces thoughts. The minds of people may be capable of greater intelligence, but the brain will never create thoughts at one percent efficiency. 6. Intelligence (art 1). A person with a good grasp of art might get more done in less time. They don’t have to go to as many appointments, they don‘t have so much stress that they need to eat, and they don’t have so many problems (school work). 7. Education (art 2). We are not all born with an equal set of tools. Some people can come up with great paintings, some don’t. But everybody should be able to learn whatever they choose if they work hard enough. 8. Intelligence (art 3). Some people can come up wit creative works of art, which inspire others to create their own. 9. Intelligence (art 4). We can teach someone how to draw. Even someone who can’t draw will soon catch on. 10. Education (art 5). If you can play an instrument, you can learn a musical instrument. You can learn to read music, so you can read some books about it. 11. Education (art 6). If you have a good grasp of history, you can study that. If you don’t have a good grasp, you can explore the world around you to understand it. 12. Intelligence (painting 1). The more knowledge you have about an artist, the more you can learn. You can go into an academy and study the artist. 13. Intelligence (painting 2). The brain creates ideas. The ideas have to be formed before the artist starts painting. 14. Intelligence (painting 3). The brain is complex. You have things like color and shape and movement and size, but you also have the brain power of people who are really good at math.

They get the cake, the cupcakes, and the soda at lunchtime. They take turns eating it. Mary doesn't want to take her employee's time out of work to eat food, and they do this for at least one day a week all year long. Why are their employees expected to spend their own money on food that they aren't allowed to buy for themselves? It is only fair that Mary pays them.<n>Output: 15.2<n><n>Input:Mary's boss wants to invite his wife to the company Christmas party, but because she has a special project to do for work, she doesn't have the time to go out and buy a suit.

I'm not experienced with firearms, so I decided to teach him how to shoot a.22 rifle. I showed the boy how to load and unload the rifle, then I handed him the rifle and held it at arm's length. When he had adjusted his sights, I handed him the bolt and the buttstock, telling him to set his sights on the target. I told the boy how to raise and lower the rifle, and that the best way to keep it steady was to keep the stock held down with one hand. When the.22's bolt was cocked and locked, I told him to pull back on the bolt so the hammer would hit the metal catch. I asked the boy to check the bore of the rifle, the bolt, and the trigger guard. After checking every place mentioned, I brought the boy back the rifle. We were on a farm, so it would have been easy to get killed by a deer if any animals were out in the open. I told him that he needed to go out to the barnyard to shoot at rabbits until he could shoot from a safe distance. He agreed not to worry about getting killed by a deer or anything dangerous. I told him that there would be plenty of deer in the barnyard if he was patient and watched where he put his shots. I then told him just to keep shooting until he wasn't afraid to fire any more. I told him that I didn't want him to get scared if he missed a shot so I told him he could try again, but if he was afraid to try he could just let go of the rifle. When the boy and I were done, I showed him how to take off his sunglasses. I then told him that I would help him find a safe place to rest when we went out to get some fresh meat to cook. I took him to where I kept my firearms and showed him where I would lock the guns up and not leave them out so they would be safe. I then went on to show him how to lock his bike up so it wouldn't be stolen. I told him that it was better to take his bike out of the barnyard than his rifle from his house. I told this to my friend's son and he said it was good advice. When the boy was finished, I helped him find some fresh meat to cook for New Year's Eve dinner.

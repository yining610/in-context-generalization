Sam said, "Sure" so when Sam came over Sam was surprised that the guy actually had something nice for him. Sam found out that after working eight hours the day before, Sam was exhausted and that he didn’t feel like his body should be allowed to stay up that late. So Sam agreed that he’d go to bed, but didn’t want to leave his house. So he kept talking to his friend, Lawrence for about 30 minutes. Lawrence was in a different time zone than Sam, so Sam asked Lawrence, why am I staying up all night talking to Lawrence? Lawrence said, "I don’t know". ( Lawrence's response would be a "Oh! Good answer.") However, Sam wouldn’t really understand what Lawrence was saying, in case Lawrence was referring to eating some really expensive Japanese food or something along those lines. So Sam went to take a nap. (Sam was planning on going out drinking with Lawrence the next day.) Sam tried to sleep for a long time, but eventually gave in and fell asleep, then in the middle of the night his mother called out for him which reminded Sam that he had to get up. He got out of bed, went to the kitchen, to go get some breakfast since he was tired. To his surprise he noticed that in the freezer he saw a package of French Toast Crunch. Then he noticed that he didn’ t have any money. He thought, "Where did all that money go?". He finally remembered that Lawrence gave up some of the French Toast Crunch for some of his French Bread Crunch! Sam realized that Lawrence was probably trying to buy him some French Toast Crunch. Sam got up, went back to Lawrence’s house, got some breakfast, went to Lawrence’s, and Lawrence gave him some French Toast Crunch that Lawrence had ordered and he had paid for already, with money that Lawrence gave him to order that food out. Sam was amazed and thankful for Lawrence, but also thought, "I guess my parents were right, maybe I probably should have gotten up". To this day Sam and Lawrence are still close (Sam’s parents like Lawrence).

During the last month, her father, Jim, has come to stay at Freddy's house a few times. He likes to visit Amber and Jim on their first night together. Jim, however, is afraid of his ex-wife, Julie, and so is hesitant to spend time with people whom she has no relationship with. In the fourth month, Julie gets a visitor from her ex's son, Tim. He and Julie have a mutual friend, Bob, and have started a relationship. Julie is a little shocked about Bob having an affair with Julie's daughter, Jennifer, and so she decides to stay with Tim instead of staying with Jim. At the end of the month, Tim and Jennifer run away with Julie's father for a weekend away. Jim is confused by this because he has been out-of-town the entire weekend and not known of the weekend away. Jim meets Johnny at a bar while drinking, and the two talk about what they might do when they get back home. At the same time, Johnny and Julie talk in their front driveway and decide that it's best if they break up and never speak again. It is at this point that Julie says "It's going to be fine." He asks what that means, and Julie says it means she will "make the transition" well by saying and doing whatever she believes she needs to do to avoid problems of the past. Johnny gives her an idea. He tells her she should tell Jim that since he has already been away for so long, then the relationship is over. This way, they can both get on with their lives. Julie decides to take his advice. She tells Jim she is taking Jennifer, Tim, and Amber to stay with her mother, Julie. The three leave her in the driveway. Three hours later, Johnny returns home alone, having spent the weekend with his father somewhere else. Later that night, Julie tells Freddy that the three people left her in the driveway over the weekend. It turns out that Jennifer asked Johnny to tell Jim that she and Amber were going

Choices:  A: radio station B: recording studio C: concert D: tv studio E: new york<n>Output:		  B<n><n>Output: The world leader of human rights has a speech that is to air on TV on the 1st of March. He is interviewed live on the BBC. He begins with the words: I am deeply ashamed of the fact that in Britain last week, the Prime Minister attacked the press. I have no doubt, however, that this will be spun as the opposition’s usual way of attacking the government. He then goes on to make a series of statements that will be used against him when he leaves office. On each of these occasions, he has told members of the media that he doesn’t think the press represent everyone but his party and the people of Britain and that journalists should use their influence on the government. To avoid embarrassment, the Prime Minister may limit questions asked about the interview to the statements he made at the beginning of the interview. On each occasion, the Prime Minister will say something like: "I'm very unhappy about the way things have been covered with journalists" and then he will turn it around and say how happy he will be, "to hear BBC coverage on the world stage" and then he will say that these stories are not representative of what he actually is thinking at that moment. Then, he will ask a question and his reaction will be something like "oh, this interview, I didn't realise that it was actually going to be that interesting". He will repeat this line of questioning several times when the interview is over before finally ending the interview stating that these remarks were made in jest. There will be one point that the interviewer will ask him that he should have denied which he will say something like "Well, I was joking but I didn't, I mean, I think we’ve come on a bit hard, haven’t we" or something to that effect. Each time, he will say something along the lines of: "it was never something that I would say about the UK's press” and then the interviewer will say "Oh it’s all so ridiculous", "You think that these stories are totally fabricated" or something to that extent which will make both of them feel that they were wronged by the press.<n><n>Input: On May 1st, the US Congress passes a bill legalizing homosexual acts in marriage.

Alfonso goes to the house and finds the woman's body. He tells his friend, Antonio, who is a morgue attendant, to bring Alfonso the body and Alfonso tells Antonio to carry the woman's body to the living room through the front door. Antonio agrees to do so. Alfonso takes the body from the house and carries it to the living room through a door. He brings the woman's body to Antonio, who carries the body to an adjacent room. Alfonso and Antonio move the body to another room. Alfonso and his friend go to the bedroom and find the woman sitting on the bed. When Alfonso hears the woman's voice say "I'm going to kill you", he pushes the television to the living room and goes to the bedroom and finds the body covered in blood. When Alfonso hears her say, "I want to make love", he opens a door and they go to the bedroom. He puts the woman's hands on the bed legs and says, "Don't touch that girl". Alfonso places the woman's body on the bed and they watch the television show. They decide to go to the bathroom. Alfonso puts the woman's body on a bedside table and sits on one leg. Antonio removes the television and Alfonso uses a towel to clean the lady's body. The man, now very upset, pulls the television out of the bedroom and carries it back into the bedroom.

Choices:  A: skate B: play piano C: fiddle D: play piano E: have fun<n>Output:		 Play music because I want to have fun. I really don't want to listen to music.<n><n>Informative Answer:<n><n>When I heard the question I thought about:  I don’t like to listen and it is distracting.  Music is a great distraction.  I feel like I can concentrate better  without music in the background.<n><n>"When I hear the question I think of:  The question of the week (The questions on the homework are always worded in a way that allows us to apply what students have done in the last week to the week before as well as answering questions we might have that the homework doesn’t).  Sometimes my students ask me if this week is a writing week or an art week.  Since this is always phrased the same way there is no discussion or reflection on what students have done so far.  And since no one works on it, it can get buried.  Sometimes I will try to put a question on the homework in an attempt to get students work on their work done, but that is not a very satisfactory way to do it.  I do try to give students choice on the homework.  Some days it is all reading homework, and on other days it is different.  I try to explain to students that they have to do the whole assignment in a particular time frame - that it is up to them what they can work on.  Sometimes the homework is set up so that it can be done at any time, but I try to make it clear that students will be penalized for skipping or not completing all their assignments.<n><n>"When you think of the question I think of the following:  The question of that week (The questions on homework are always posed the exact same way).  I would love to hear from other art teachers how they answer these kinds of questions."<n><n>"When you hear the question I think about:  The most appropriate piece of art for the classroom.  I love the expression in this piece.  There are so many different ways the art can be used.  The students who put the art here would think of it as art.  They would look over this piece again while I explained the concept of a piece of art in their classes.  I often get questions from kids wondering how to express themselves.  The responses for this question are always helpful."

They end up taking a bus each day instead... what day were they both working?<n>Output: Monday<n><n>Input:The lady's uncle has a store called "The Book Store", and he wanted to build a book shelf to store his books. He decided to use a large metal box and put four shelves on each side. He ordered a small metal box each for the front and the top. One each of six feet long, three feet high, and four feet wide. The man ordered two of each size to start. First he measured how far the shelves would reach and he measured the three feet between the shelves. He then calculated how many pages each book would be able to hold. He finally worked out the amount of page space needed, and bought two large books for front and top shelves and four small books for the backs. Finally it was time to order the box. The man called the number on the box and they arranged a time to come out. When the man asked for the size of box, the customer told him they were the ones he ordered. The driver handed the boxes to the worker and the worker started unrolling them. The man looked and there they both were, two boxes both the same size, and both the same price. The worker began packing the boxes while the customer went in search of the keys in his pocket. Then the worker came out and asked the man, 'I'm going to ask you to pay me by cheque' He explained to the customer about the size of the box, and that when he went to pay, it would look like he had a bunch of cheques. The driver went back into the store and returned with the keys. The customer then said, 'So you want my money now?' 'Yes, of course.' He passed the cheques to the customer and left. The money came out about the time the box was finished. The customer asked, 'So now I have two of those boxes?' 'Yes,' the driver replied. When the collector met the couple in his truck to ask for the keys, they both handed him a check. The collector opened 'The Book Store' and it became 'The Book Store' by default.

Where might he look for a potato. Choices:  A: restaurants B: casserole C: root cellar D: pockets E: pantry<n>Output:		 He looked inside the fridge.<n><n>The solution: Answer the question from the example above! It is easy, simply solve for the number of books in Room and multiply that by 60 to get the number of books not sold in the example (600). We can then use the above formula to find the number of minutes he worked per day.<n><n>We have learned that one can calculate a number of books not sold with the help of a fraction, one of the simplest types of counting.<n><n>You can add or divide fractions by just dividing by a power or any number.<n><n>A fraction by power<n><n>A fraction can be written as:       = .  This expression will always give us the same answer.  We can use this expression to divide fractions too. It doesn't matter which numerator.<n><n>I would like to explain why:<n><n>The first number in the fraction is not the same as the denominator. In mathematics, we know that 2+2 is actually 3. 2+3 is 2 and 3 therefore the number is not equal 2+3. There is an algebraic way to solve this problem with a fraction by a power. We can use the following equation:<n><n>This is the same equation that we used to solve for the number of hours that Lawrence worked which was given as 5.5.<n><n>1+2*3+4+.=<n>1+6*3+6+5*.=<n>1+4*3+6+..= =<n>. In this equation the number is the same as 1. The power of 2 has nothing to do with it.<n><n>2+3*3+6+...=<n>2+4*3+.=<n>. In this equation power of 6 has nothing to do with 2. This is because the fraction by 3 is equal to the fraction by 4.<n><n>2+2*2+1*1=<n>. In this fraction it has to do with 2. It is a power of 2 because it has been multiplied by 2.<n><n>3+6*3+2*2=<n>. In this problem it has to do with 4. It's been multiplied by 3 twice, which is equivalent to the power of 3.<n><n>4+6*2*3+1*1=:<n><n>This is an example that showed me the power of fractions. It took me about 5 minutes to calculate the time that Lawrence worked

However...<n><n>The second one, which is the main question here, asks how many candies do tapanga have before she is able to see someone and not run away. She is already able to see a guy and not run away. That is not true; she is still able to run away.<n><n>The question has two parts (though only one picture):<n>1) The part with how many candies do she currently have<n>2) The part with the guy<n><n>So, the first half is about how many candies do each of them have. The "how much candies" refers to the answer to part one.<n><n>The second half asks how many candies did the two different parts of the question say they had. What should be the answer to that question?<n><n>The answer (at least on the first question) tells us only that she has about 68 candies together. The actual "how many candies" part tells us that she has about 67 together, but that she has already seen a guy and not run.<n><n>I also don't see how the "how many candies have you seen" question is related to the "how many candishes have you seen" part of the main question. I doubt that you can answer that question after having already seen a guy.<n><n>Now with such a small group, in case they have multiple members, I'm just letting you know the general answer. :)

From this Pythagorean theorem we can determine the shortest line between P and Q. Let’s see the diagram.<n>Output: 10 -5 = 25<n><n>Input:What would be the length of the shortest rope made by attaching 2 lengths of rope together? Answer: First we have to calculate the length of the rope we are to consider. We first need to know how far a rope will reach. Let’s say this rope will reach the ground and the other distance is 30 feet. We have 2 ropes A and B. A is shorter than B so we will use the distance between the two as the length of the rope B. Also let's say that this distance between the two ropes is 10 meters. Let's look at the diagram.<n>Output<n><n>Input:What happened to the children's birthday cake? Answer: they forgot to pick it up.

However, the man could not get up, since his leg was broken. The astronaut then tried to use his foot, but it failed as well. In the end, the astronaut realized his right leg was the problem and he had to amputate it completely. The astronaut then went to find a surgeon, who told him that his best hope was that he would lose his leg. The astronaut then had the surgeon use his other leg, which made his left leg work, but without the sense of what caused the accident. Finally, he found a doctor who was willing to try to save his leg and try to make it work. He told the astronaut that he would put a robot on his leg that would help the astronaut to move. The astronaut signed the papers so the robot could be used and his leg cut from the outside. After the robot was removed, the astronaut slowly regained his ability to use his leg. The end result was that his entire body became like that of a robot, except for his legs and arms. When the doctor found out about the robot, he became alarmed, and told the astronaut to take care not to use it for too long or to make it move too fast. He also wanted the surgery done immediately, but the doctor thought it would be dangerous. So, he and the astronaut both agreed that they would let the robot do the surgery. After about 2 to 3 minutes after the robot was removed, it began to move and feel like a real person again. The doctor then tried to tell the astronaut to stop the robot, but he refused. When the doctor tried to pull out his own leg again, it started to move, but the robot made it stop again. He

You would take it back then?’ He says, ‘I don’t know. That is what I will have to do. Take it or leave it.’ Mary says, ‘Well.

The cake mixture will puff out. Next you place the cake mixture into a bowl with a lid and pound for about 45 minutes until the cake mixture has a crumbly texture and is about the same size as the cake. Then you put the cake mixture into the oven and bake the cake for 20 minutes with a wooden or aluminum tin on the bottom. After the cake is baked turn it over and repeat for about five more times. The second cake is better than the first. It is much easier to eat. The second cake is heavier though. This cake takes less time to bake. This cake is also better than the first cake because it makes one cake out of a couple of pieces of cake.<n><n>Input: You have two  (e.g., the two highest-ranked answers from the last four questions will be combined).

You calculate the maximum rate for running the pump when it is at "run-time". What is the maximum speed?<n>Output: 0.3 m per second<n><n>Input:When you move a weight in a straight line, the direction you move is the same as the direction the weight would travel if you ran the distance at normal speed. If the weight has a constant velocity, then so too will you have a constant velocity. However, when the velocity is high enough, the force of the weight causes it to move in the same direction (or at the same constant velocity) regardless of direction. For example, if you move a rock with your foot, the rock will move in the same direction a few meters away from your foot. On the other hand, if the rock is moving slowly enough, because it has a high enough velocity, the rock will move against your feet, away from your foot. What is the maximum velocity that a person can run?<n>Output: 6.37 meters per second<n><n>Inputs: To what power can you convert a sinusoidal electrical wave, if any, into a linear magnetic

Last year, he had a patient who died from pneumonia. The doctor decided to order a lung scan as part of his annual exam. That scan revealed that James Smith had ten to twelve hundred pounds of fat deposited on his lungs and heart. The doctor wanted to remove that fat from James Smith's body. James Smith's wife was strongly opposed to the idea. She was a very beautiful woman. James Smith's family argued with him about this. Finally, James Smith gave in to the idea. A friend of James Smith's told him he would have to wait for the doctor to become more healthy so that he could get the fat removed from James' body. It was not until months later, that James Smith finally received the scan test results and was found to be alive. As a result of this new test, his wife asked James Smith what his wishes were.

If you pick up a coin that has nothing underneath, that does not add to your personal find. If you pick up a sword in the middle of a dark room, it does not count as an item in the sword's find or an item in the player's find. In addition:  If a player drops his weapon upon picking it up, another player cannot pick it up (if a roll of 2 is rolled, then he cannot pick it up until he rolls a 3, and so forth). If the roll is 6 or more, then if the player has an item with no find, it may be passed on for an other object. If someone drops his weapon (or the weapons of all others) on the floor and someone finds it first, then a search is not made to see if the coin, sword, or sword has a find. If a player's roll is 4 or more, then the weapon cannot be put to a test (unless there is 5 or more other finds which come before it).

"My dad got me a new computer, but now I can't afford to buy a school book. I don't know why they gave me a computer, but I can't afford a school book!" The same is true of people. We all have an experience that we hate. So you may ask why are we here?<n>We are here because our own lives can be summed up in these 4 simple words: LOVE, CARE, COMPASSION and FAITH. You see, our purpose is to live lives that we love, so that we may be the best we can be because the best we are is what other people expect from us. This is exactly the purpose of the faith dimension, to guide our lives so that we may find love, care, compassion, and faith within. We must choose to love God, other people, and ourself. When we do that, our personal experiences will be greater, our relationships will be better, and we will experience joy on a regular basis.<n>In the beginning, our job is to love God, but as time passes we'll come to love other people as well. The process begins when we take a page out of the Love and Compassion manual and start loving others as we love ourselves. We can only do that by choosing to be kind, considerate, and respectful to others. As these values grow in us, we will learn to love ourselves. We want to be the best versions of ourselves that we are capable of being, because only then can we start to be the best we are capable of being for others.<n>Love and Compassion will guide your daily relationships all the way through college and throughout your life. If you aren't loving God, caring for others, and sharing these qualities with others, the road to success will be difficult if you expect to accomplish your goals in life. It is never too late to change, and today is your first day. Take this opportunity to start loving yourself and becoming the best version of yourself.

Each answer must be an essay.  The answer must be 100 words long, including a sentence or two describing your reasons.<n>Input: The following essay was written by a student.<n>Input: I believe conservation takes the importance of our environment, especially in our modern society. For me it is very important to protect the forests around the world because in my opinion these forests provide a large amount of oxygen for humans. I think it is very important that conservation doesn’t just mean protecting the forests it means also protecting other parts of the environment such as the oceans and also in doing this conservation I think we need to also think about global warming.<n>Output: A<n><n>Input: The above sentence is to describe why it is important for the United States to reduce greenhouse gases.  In order to comply with the Paris Climate Accord, we are now required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Our goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 32% from 2005 levels as in 2017.   We are committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but we are not sure if we will ever reach that goal, this is why we are going to invest big into renewable energy in order to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  I believe that this investment is important because we need clean energy to continue to develop as a country.  My reasons for this are 1.  Because of the environment 2.  Because we want our energy to cost less.  So my opinion is that we should focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to further the development of clean energy and this research is an important step towards this goal. Please answer the following questions to complete your essay:<n>1.  In a small town, would you buy $100 of clothing or $100 of shoes?  2.  Does anyone wear clothes to bed, or shoes to bed?<n>3.

If you answer all the questions you need and choose the best possible answer, more information is available. If you try not to answer more than you might otherwise (by, for example, asking the question in reverse), less is available.<n><n>A simple rule of thumb is that the larger the question field, the more likely it is to have a "bad" (less acceptable) answer.

About 40 minutes later, a delivery man knocked on the door. He said: "How do you feel?" The man replied: "Just fine." The man then stood up and entered the car and drove off. When the man walked back into the office, he noticed a strange stain on the back of his seat. About 20 minutes later, a man walked into the office. He sat down, took out his car key and went through his keys first. Then he picked up his shoes and he went out into the parking lot, opened his garage door, looked in his driveway, put his car keys in his pocket, locked his car and entered his garage door, locked the garage door again and shut it behind him. On the way back he noticed that the stain had spread and was now covering the back of his seat, the back of his armrest, and the center console. After he got back into the office, the man looked at his seat, the armrest and the center console. The man realized that he had been driving around for several hours and might have left a deposit on the seat. The man went back into the office and he noticed a strange stain again on the back of his chair. After checking the stain several more times, the man asked his wife and she checked, too. When she saw the stain, she said: "Does this look like a place a stain would come from?" After looking at it a few more times, the man started to get suspicious. He looked for any reason that this stain could have been spread by some other person. He thought about how it could be the result of somebody accidentally running into the back of him, or it could be the result a spilled drink. He began searching the office and he found a bag in the desk drawer. He took out a bottle of Windex and cleaned it. After cleaning it, he put the stain on the seat of his chair and went to the back of his chair to see if it was still there. When he sat down, again the stain was there. The man started to get really upset. He immediately went to his wife and told her that he thought that the stain was a spot from a spill in the car. He then called the man whose car was sitting in the driveway and told him that it seemed suspicious. The man then

Suddenly, from outside, came the roar of a locomotive. A huge train with a black smoke and black smoke billowing from its windows, pulled out of the town’s station and roared to a halt at the edge of the snow. A middle aged man dressed in what looked like a white blazer, with bushy grey mustache and bushy grey cap walked briskly to the middle of the platform and sat down in a wooden bench. His legs were covered in the white blanket offered by the man, wrapped around his knees and ankles. After a minute, the locomotive roared to a full stop and the man climbed off his seat as fast as his long legs would carry him. He got down and disappeared around the corner of the train. From the other side of the bench came the sound of more screeching of the engine and the whir of the train’s wheel and a distant clunk and bang on the bridge. The man in the wooden bench, now without the heavy blanket, got out of the coach and opened the door for the engineer. He got off the coach, took off the coat and scarf and stood in front of the locomotive for a minute, in a position only as comfortable as sitting on a wooden bench on either side of the engine. Then the man sat again and waited for the engine to get to a full stop as it idled away from the tracks. A few minutes later, the sound of another clunk and a heavy thump from behind the locomotive and the man in the wooden bench stood a third time. The man again sat again and the sound of the railway carriage passing over the bridge resumed. The man watched the clock as it ticked slowly. Another few minutes passed and the engine was completely silent. The man got up, picked up the coat and scarf and stepped off the coach. He pushed against cold metal and stepped cautiously onto the railway bridge. With his arm around his wife, who stood on the other side, he glanced back towards the station and waited for the engine train to pass. He watched through the gap in the door, across the bridge,

The clouds that rain are not black but bright and clear, and the water comes out of the sky, and soaks the grass, and makes it brown. When the clouds clear up, the sun shines again. Is this the case of the human body?   The body has all sorts of problems with the sun. It gets hot, it puts the body into the sunburn condition, but the bad thing is, while doing it, it does not cool off very well. This condition makes the body overheat and burns, and after a while, it begins to hurt. The body tries to cool down, so the mind tells you to drink cold water.   The body tries to cool off, by sleeping.   The body gets so cold that it feels as though everything is closing around it and pulling it inside. It cries out, “help me, help me” and that is what makes you feel guilty.  The mind wants to help the body, and that is why it is in love with you.  The mind loves you, because when the sun shines, it is very nice, and its rays cause good things for you, although it hurts the body much.   The mind and the body also have lots of good times together. The mind has a lot of fun and laughs a lot.   The mind loves you but knows it cannot get to you, because of the great distance, but it does love you.

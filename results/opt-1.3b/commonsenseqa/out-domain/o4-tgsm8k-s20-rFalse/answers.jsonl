Sam said, \"Sure\" so when Sam came over Sam was surprised that the guy actually had something nice for him. Sam found out that after working eight hours the day before, Sam was exhausted and that he didn\u2019t feel like his body should be allowed to stay up that late. So Sam agreed that he\u2019d go to bed, but didn\u2019t want to leave his house. So he kept talking to his friend, Lawrence for about 30 minutes. Lawrence was in a different time zone than Sam, so Sam asked Lawrence, why am I staying up all night talking to Lawrence? Lawrence said, \"I don\u2019t know\". ( Lawrence's response would be a \"Oh! Good answer.\") However, Sam wouldn\u2019t really understand what Lawrence was saying, in case Lawrence was referring to eating some really expensive Japanese food or something along those lines. So Sam went to take a nap. (Sam was planning on going out drinking with Lawrence the next day.) Sam tried to sleep for a long time, but eventually gave in and fell asleep, then in the middle of the night his mother called out for him which reminded Sam that he had to get up. He got out of bed, went to the kitchen, to go get some breakfast since he was tired. To his surprise he noticed that in the freezer he saw a package of French Toast Crunch. Then he noticed that he didn\u2019 t have any money. He thought, \"Where did all that money go?\". He finally remembered that Lawrence gave up some of the French Toast Crunch for some of his French Bread Crunch! Sam realized that Lawrence was probably trying to buy him some French Toast Crunch. Sam got up, went back to Lawrence\u2019s house, got some breakfast, went to Lawrence\u2019s, and Lawrence gave him some French Toast Crunch that Lawrence had ordered and he had paid for already, with money that Lawrence gave him to order that food out. Sam was amazed and thankful for Lawrence, but also thought, \"I guess my parents were right, maybe I probably should have gotten up\".

He begins with the words: I am deeply ashamed of the fact that in Britain last week, the Prime Minister attacked the press. I have no doubt, however, that this will be spun as the opposition\u2019s usual way of attacking the government. He then goes on to make a series of statements that will be used against him when he leaves office. On each of these occasions, he has told members of the media that he doesn\u2019t think the press represent everyone but his party and the people of Britain and that journalists should use their influence on the government. To avoid embarrassment, the Prime Minister may limit questions asked about the interview to the statements he made at the beginning of the interview. On each occasion, the Prime Minister will say something like: \"I'm very unhappy about the way things have been covered with journalists\" and then he will turn it around and say how happy he will be, \"to hear BBC coverage on the world stage\" and then he will say that these stories are not representative of what he actually is thinking at that moment. Then, he will ask a question and his reaction will be something like \"oh, this interview, I didn't realise that it was actually going to be that interesting\". He will repeat this line of questioning several times when the interview is over before finally ending the interview stating that these remarks were made in jest. There will be one point that the interviewer will ask him that he should have denied which he will say something like \"Well, I was joking but I didn't, I mean, I think we\u2019ve come on a bit hard, haven\u2019t we\" or something to that effect. Each time, he will say something along the lines of: \"it was never something that I would say about the UK's press\u201d and then the interviewer will say \"Oh it\u2019s all so ridiculous\", \"You think that these stories are totally fabricated\" or something to that extent which will make both of them feel that they were wronged by the press.\n\nInput: On May 1st, the US Congress passes a bill legalizing homosexual acts in marriage.

I feel like I can concentrate better  without music in the background.\n\n\"When I hear the question I think of:  The question of the week (The questions on the homework are always worded in a way that allows us to apply what students have done in the last week to the week before as well as answering questions we might have that the homework doesn\u2019t).  Sometimes my students ask me if this week is a writing week or an art week.  Since this is always phrased the same way there is no discussion or reflection on what students have done so far.  And since no one works on it, it can get buried.  Sometimes I will try to put a question on the homework in an attempt to get students work on their work done, but that is not a very satisfactory way to do it.  I do try to give students choice on the homework.  Some days it is all reading homework, and on other days it is different.  I try to explain to students that they have to do the whole assignment in a particular time frame - that it is up to them what they can work on.  Sometimes the homework is set up so that it can be done at any time, but I try to make it clear that students will be penalized for skipping or not completing all their assignments.\n\n\"When you think of the question I think of the following:  The question of that week (The questions on homework are always posed the exact same way).  I would love to hear from other art teachers how they answer these kinds of questions.\"\n\n\"When you hear the question I think about:  The most appropriate piece of art for the classroom.  I love the expression in this piece.  There are so many different ways the art can be used.  The students who put the art here would think of it as art.

The driver handed the boxes to the worker and the worker started unrolling them. The man looked and there they both were, two boxes both the same size, and both the same price. The worker began packing the boxes while the customer went in search of the keys in his pocket. Then the worker came out and asked the man, 'I'm going to ask you to pay me by cheque' He explained to the customer about the size of the box, and that when he went to pay, it would look like he had a bunch of cheques.

{"text": "He looked inside the fridge.\n\nThe solution: Answer the question from the example above! It is easy, simply solve for the number of books in Room and multiply that by 60 to get the number of books not sold in the example (600). We can then use the above formula to find the number of minutes he worked per day.\n\nWe have learned that one can calculate a number of books not sold with the help of a fraction, one of the simplest types of counting.\n\nYou can add or divide fractions by just dividing by a power or any number.\n\nA fraction by power\n\nA fraction can be written as:       = .  This expression will always give us the same answer.  We can use this expression to divide fractions too. It doesn't matter which numerator.\n\nI would like to explain why:\n\nThe first number in the fraction is not the same as the denominator. In mathematics, we know that 2+2 is actually 3. 2+3 is 2 and 3 therefore the number is not equal 2+3. There is an algebraic way to solve this problem with a fraction by a power. We can use the following equation:\n\nThis is the same equation that we used to solve for the number of hours that Lawrence worked which was given as 5.5.\n\n1+2*3+4+.=\n1+6*3+6+5*.=\n1+4*3+6+..= =\n. In this equation the number is the same as 1. The power of 2 has nothing to do with it.\n\n2+3*3+6+...=\n2+4*3+.=\n. In this equation power of 6 has nothing to do with 2. This is because the fraction by 3 is equal to the fraction by 4.\n\n2+2*2+1*1=\n. In this fraction it has to do with 2. It is a power of 2 because it has been multiplied by 2.\n\n3+6*3+2*2=\n. In this problem it has to do with 4. It's been multiplied by 3 twice, which is equivalent to the power of 3.\n\n4+6*2*3+1*1=:\n\nThis is an example that showed me the power of fractions. It took me about 5 minutes to calculate the time that Lawrence worked", "answer": "E: pantry"}

The cake mixture will puff out. Next you place the cake mixture into a bowl with a lid and pound for about 45 minutes until the cake mixture has a crumbly texture and is about the same size as the cake. Then you put the cake mixture into the oven and bake the cake for 20 minutes with a wooden or aluminum tin on the bottom. After the cake is baked turn it over and repeat for about five more times.

For example, if you move a rock with your foot, the rock will move in the same direction a few meters away from your foot. On the other hand, if the rock is moving slowly enough, because it has a high enough velocity, the rock will move against your feet, away from your foot.

I don't know why they gave me a computer, but I can't afford a school book!\" The same is true of people. We all have an experience that we hate. So you may ask why are we here?\nWe are here because our own lives can be summed up in these 4 simple words: LOVE, CARE, COMPASSION and FAITH. You see, our purpose is to live lives that we love, so that we may be the best we can be because the best we are is what other people expect from us. This is exactly the purpose of the faith dimension, to guide our lives so that we may find love, care, compassion, and faith within. We must choose to love God, other people, and ourself. When we do that, our personal experiences will be greater, our relationships will be better, and we will experience joy on a regular basis.\nIn the beginning, our job is to love God, but as time passes we'll come to love other people as well. The process begins when we take a page out of the Love and Compassion manual and start loving others as we love ourselves. We can only do that by choosing to be kind, considerate, and respectful to others. As these values grow in us, we will learn to love ourselves. We want to be the best versions of ourselves that we are capable of being, because only then can we start to be the best we are capable of being for others.\nLove and Compassion will guide your daily relationships all the way through college and throughout your life. If you aren't loving God, caring for others, and sharing these qualities with others, the road to success will be difficult if you expect to accomplish your goals in life. It is never too late to change, and today is your first day. Take this opportunity to start loving yourself and becoming the best version of yourself.", "answer": "D: graduate"}

For me it is very important to protect the forests around the world because in my opinion these forests provide a large amount of oxygen for humans.

In order to comply with the Paris Climate Accord, we are now required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Our goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 32% from 2005 levels as in 2017.   We are committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but we are not sure if we will ever reach that goal, this is why we are going to invest big into renewable energy in order to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  I believe that this investment is important because we need clean energy to continue to develop as a country.  My reasons for this are 1.  Because of the environment 2.  Because we want our energy to cost less.  So my opinion is that we should focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to further the development of clean energy and this research is an important step towards this goal.

Suddenly, from outside, came the roar of a locomotive. A huge train with a black smoke and black smoke billowing from its windows, pulled out of the town\u2019s station and roared to a halt at the edge of the snow. A middle aged man dressed in what looked like a white blazer, with bushy grey mustache and bushy grey cap walked briskly to the middle of the platform and sat down in a wooden bench.

After a minute, the locomotive roared to a full stop and the man climbed off his seat as fast as his long legs would carry him. He got down and disappeared around the corner of the train. From the other side of the bench came the sound of more screeching of the engine and the whir of the train\u2019s wheel and a distant clunk and bang on the bridge. The man in the wooden bench, now without the heavy blanket, got out of the coach and opened the door for the engineer. He got off the coach, took off the coat and scarf and stood in front of the locomotive for a minute, in a position only as comfortable as sitting on a wooden bench on either side of the engine.

A few minutes later, the sound of another clunk and a heavy thump from behind the locomotive and the man in the wooden bench stood a third time. The man again sat again and the sound of the railway carriage passing over the bridge resumed. The man watched the clock as it ticked slowly. Another few minutes passed and the engine was completely silent. The man got up, picked up the coat and scarf and stepped off the coach. He pushed against cold metal and stepped cautiously onto the railway bridge. With his arm around his wife, who stood on the other side, he glanced back towards the station and waited for the engine train to pass. He watched through the gap in the door, across the bridge,", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

B said, What will she do? I don\u2019\u2019t like that girl anymore. Dad said, When did you say that? B said after I got into the car and asked her why she stopped the car.  Dad said, Are you really going to ask her?  B said, What choice did I ever have?  Dad said, Really? You think you don\u2019\u2019to ask about who was driving?  B said, I don\u2019t know.

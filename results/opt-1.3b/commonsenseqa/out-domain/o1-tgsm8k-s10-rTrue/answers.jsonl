So the final answer is 3.12.000\n\nThis is a very stupid question and I don\u2019t know why all people who answer it think it\u2019s a smart one. The example is wrong\u2026 How am I supposed to know that a kilo cost $12? I just got three out of the blue. It doesn\u2019t mean that the price has increased or decreased. I mean of cause they should say it costs $30 but not how much more, so in my scenario my question wasn\u2019t useless.\n\nYou didn\u2019t make any assumptions. The question was, \u201cwhat was Adam paying for his groceries?\u201d and you gave the price as a percentage, which you can\u2019t really say exactly how much he spent on each of the items. I don\u2019t think that answers the question correctly.\n\nI did the math for you. In the same order that he would have had to buy 3 pieces of bread, he also bought 2 pieces of rice and two handfuls of vegetables, and he would only spend $18 on each of them. So, with those three items, he spent $18 on food. And of cause, it would have also had to be eaten before he would be able to afford anything else. So, my example, like yours, was technically incorrect, but it still answers the question correctly, just in the incorrect way.\n\nActually, my example was exactly correct: The problem was that I didn\u2019t find out if he was using the kilo or the gram or the pound. A kilo is a gram, so unless Adam said that he was buying all the food in one go, which I didn\u2019t see anywhere, he would probably have to pay $6.32 for the bread. (That\u2019s the only way to buy the food in one go.)\n\nYeah, I can see that. That\u2019s an example of how it\u2019s technically incorrect, not of how it\u2019ll be used or misused.

He and his wife have a nice dinner with his mother-in- law and the children and then head inside for a movie. When they get home, Adam asks for his mother-In-law to give him $100 plus $50 for his movie ticket. His mother-in-law, who is already very sick, gives him her best attempt at speaking to him and says she will get that money once he gets back. The family, however has to pay $70 plus about $50 for rent because they are renting out a second home and also have another one that they live in when the wife is not there. The wife also spends much of that $70 to take pictures for Christmas cards. Finally, the family heads to the bank to pay for the $130 transaction. This causes more family troubles as the bank is closed on Christmas.\nInput:Adam buys a house in which he does not have insurance. He has only been in the house for 10 days, yet the bank forecloses.

He refuses to give back the $300 to the owner of the house and says he will file a lawsuit to stop the foreclosures and take his case to a higher court. The money is gone. So Adam is able to sue the bank in a higher court and get money to pay the foreclosures.

The doctors say that the cause of the failure of the fetus to survive may be a brain defect. It\u2019s too early to try surgery, they advise, because the brain does not develop until the toddler is 12 or so. So the baby is put up for adoption.

Boring\nb: Cheap\nc: Useless, it has been calculated by the computer\nd: Average\n\nExample 1:\nAnswer: A milk vendor sells 500 gallons of milk for less than the average price $0.55 per 100 grams.\n\nInput:\nA milk vendor earns money from selling 500 gallons of milk.\nB. Is it possible to sell a gallon of milk at the average price $0?\nOutput:\nA. Yes\nB. No\nC. The average price is $0.48\nD. The cheapest way to get this price is for customers to pay $1.00\n\nExamples 2 &3:\nAnswer: A customer comes to the milk vendor and orders 500 gallons. The total cost for him is $52.00. Since the vendor can sell a gallon for $0.58 per 100 grams, A has earned $52.00 + $8.90=$59.00. His total price is $60, and since the average price is $0, $60.90 is the minimum. He has to pay $4.80 for insurance and $9.00 for taxes. So the total of $59.00 - $10.90=$39.60, less taxes and insurance. Then he can only pay for the milk $9.50 in exchange for his 500 grams of milk - $9.50 = $53.30. Since he has to pay $2.50 for insurance which is a discount compared to other vendors, the total price is still $40, less taxes and insurance, so the total of $40 - $37.30=$36.30. So he can only buy $40 worth of milk and pay $4.20 per gallon, or $3.80 for the milk.\n\nInput:A:A customer arrives at a shop and asks for coffee.

The scientist is working for weeks and weeks and months on the research and is finally able to solve the math problem to her satisfaction. The scientist finally has the solution to her problem and she produces a device that is 30 times less inefficient than her previous device. She then goes to submit her work for publication. The publisher says the device was an improvement, but that the scientific community is too skeptical that an obvious improvement could be possible. The scientist is then fired because she can't convince the scientific community that the improvement is real. What does the scientist do?\nInput:I am an engineer. What's your opinion of engineers? How would you rate our job skills?\nOutput: I'm a very honest engineer. When I'm designing a new product, I don't like to change my designs because there is usually a problem with the design and a quick fix will not work, I only make changes if I have to. My job is to take the best ideas and implement them into something that will be marketable. Most engineers are honest, and work hard, but some are dishonest. A lot of people take the easy way out by modifying an existing product that uses the same process or takes another design from a different competitor. Engineering does help you stay on top of the latest developments in technology to stay ahead of the game, but it is difficult to hide the fact that some of your actions will cause harm to others.\nInput:What does computer programming entail? And what is the biggest hurdle people with engineering degrees face before starting their careers?\nOutput: I can't say I've ever had to take a programming course. I've only taken a couple computer science classes. There is very little you can do without knowing how to program. If you aren't a programmer, it's difficult to start, but once you start, it's an easy thing to get used to.

In addition, even if you had played against a competent opponent in the past, there are still dozens of moves to think about, each with at least an elementary possibility. You cannot calculate in your head precisely what may happen, so you need some way to know what to do if you do happen to lose.\n\nThe most popular way to know what to bet and when is by placing a winning bet. There are games in which you simply try to win as quickly as you can. The less experienced you are, the more difficult and boring these games become, but they are still useful. For example, you could learn to play a game of Go so that you can try to win the game and the game and the game in succession. There, in each position, there are hundreds of possible moves, so you will never get caught out with an opponent who is much better. To play a game of Go it is easy to memorize random numbers which can make random guesses. The point is to win in the fastest way possible by doing this, by doing what is called the \"best bet\". In order to bet on your side of the chess game you will not notice that you have lost at any point for many years. Each game of Go has its own rules: You can get very lucky as soon as you find a good pattern which you are able to learn. And you can lose on your opponent's side very quickly, but the pattern you are trying to learn can remain for a long time, and if you get lucky, it will be easier for you to win again. Finally, there can be a pattern which you are unable to learn because the rules of chess are hard to comprehend and you have to guess or look at a board a million times until you can understand it all.\n\nYou can think of strategy for a single game of Go. However, in a game with a large number of possible moves, some of them have the strongest probability of winning: the moves", "answer": "C: castle"}

You might see it in a story or some video if you care enough.\n\nI find this an interesting article.

It costs $14 to feed them, so $5 per day for each of them is $14, the total cost of their meal will be $2,400.00 for the month.\n\nIn their daily lives we need a lot of money in order to live comfortably and also get things done. In our life they may not like it, but without money we will really be in trouble in terms of being able to enjoy what life we have. Now if they keep this in mind then the question of the cost of their feeding each day can be easier to answer.\n\nFirst answer: The first boy in our example wants to know how much it is worth to have a good life in life, and how much money he should try to get if he wants to have a good life. The total amount of money he will need to earn by working is $500.00 when he is 16. The first answer above is $500 =$500.00 divided by 5 = $", "answer": "C: fast"}

How much money could it make? (no input needed)\nOutput: $14,100\nWhat would you call this business?\n\nInput:\n1) The price of milk is $5 per cubic centimetre, and the price of sugar is $0 per cubic centimetre. So to make a kilo of milk one has to pay $5 per cubic centimeter.\n2) Let's take the amount of sugar per one kilo of milk, and multiply it by 5 kilogram per day. So to make 5 kilograms of sugar per one kilogram of milk you have to pay $5 per kilogram of milk. So,\n3) Let's say one kilogram of sugar costs $0 per kilogram of milk, so then we can make $500 per kilogram of sugar per 24 hours instead of $1,500 per kilogram of milk per 24 hours. So,\n4) Now we have to take the number of kilojoules per one kilogram of sugar and divide it by five. The result will be $6 per kilojoule. So,\n5) That's it, the kilojoule price, the sugar cost is $5 per kilogram per day.\n6)Now we have our kilojoules per kilogram of sugar. That's how much money you can make per one kilo of sugar.\n7)The amount of kilojoules/ kilogram of sugar is $.0565.\n8)So every time you pour 100 kilojoules one kilo of sugar, you can earn $18 or $190 per day.\n9)That's $18 per 8 hours or $190 per 8 days.\n10)If we look at our kilojoule, we see that for each kilojoule there are 9,400 kilojoules.\n11)Now we have to make our kilojoules/kilogram of sugar per day.\n12)Let's say it cost $0.50 for 50 kilojoules.

{"text": "It is in New York according to you answer.\n\nThe first example contains a mistake. The department is not located in downtown New York. Downtown (NY) is a name given to the geographical area around Manhattan, that is, the central/western part of the territory of New York City. This is the part that the department store is located in, although it is only a part of it: there is also a much larger neighbourhood called Chelsea and many other parts of Manhattan outside of Manhattan. Hence it is impossible to give the actual street the name of the particular department store because there is no such street. Instead you will get the area code to the nearest major city if you give the address as one of those, but I do not allow it.\n\nThe second example contains a mistake as well: Adam made a mistake in choosing two kilograms of nuts, and three kilograms of dried fruits. For this, make sure that you do not give any wrong ones. A kilo of nuts cost $25, whereas one kilogram of dried fruits cost $5.

If you see a clock in another room or hear a radio, you will be in a dangerous and potentially dangerous situation.  (Yes, this is a terrible idea and there will be people who get hurt over the 2 minute window, but the time is too close for us to be safe.)\nOption B: Put the clock back in one room.

Answer: When inflation was high and exports were low, the US government had few alternative means of financing the massive amount of debt it was carrying. So they went into debt, selling bonds, that would later be paid back in full by the export surplus. As a result, the dollar skyrocketed during the 19th century. The end of that boom made an already shaky dollar even more so. People were more and more concerned about their money leaving their country if the country started to lose interest (that interest now comes from the US government). As a result, many countries adopted the dollar as their benchmark currency in hopes it would become stronger. As long as the dollar stays strong, the US government will continue to spend money.

But we can be certain that prices will continue to fall for the rest of this decade and for several more years.

{"text": "A,C and C are the correct answers. B might be the answer, but not D, E, or E.\n\nInput:The doctor told us that two patients are very sick. The patient A has a high fever and all other symptoms match the patient B. The patient A takes medication but after one hour has no decrease in the fever. The patient A asks the doctor for a second opinion. The doctor gives the patient B a prescription and sends him home. The patient B is better after a while, but the patient A has some new problems. He feels extremely weak and his fever has still increased a little. What actions do you recommend for the patient A?\nInput: The doctor will prescribe a medicine on A's request. After an hour, the patient A will take the medicine. Now the fever is down, but the patient's feeling is still terrible (the patient a feels like he has the flu). So the doctor wants to treat the fever again, but he first wants to investigate whether the patient a is getting better or not. So the doctor will use the same medicine to treat the fever once more.\n\nAnswer: A) \u00a0When prescribing an antibiotic to a patient with a fever of more than 39\u00b0C, the doctor will first conduct an initial consultation to establish whether there is a physical cause of the fever. If there is none, it is most certainly a cold, and antibiotics will give relief for these conditions.

{"text": "I did not leave a book this time, I did not bring a book with me at the time or at home.\n\nInput (A): You need to buy a loaf of bread at a market for 50,000 won. At an ATM you need to withdraw only 30,000 won. The ATM machine does not accept 50,000, so it charges you 50,000 won. Therefore: 1) you have to go back home where you have your phone and change the amount to 60,000 won 2) once you have finished the payment, the bank charges you an extra fee for the withdrawal 3) you then have to make a deposit again at the bank to withdraw the additional 60,000 won 4) the bank may charge you an additional fee for the deposit of the 60,000 won. Therefore, let's say you had to deposit all 70,000 won. In that case you need to travel to the market 10 times, so you still have to pay the extra 30,000 won on your way to the market. So your final destination is:\nInput (B): The bank charges you the amount of 20,000 won when you use your foreign ATM card at the foreign branch. That's equal to 20,000 won for each time you use the ATM card 4) once you have finished checking the amount you have, the bank charges you the amount you have deducted for the fees (in the above example, the bank charges you 2,000 won per transaction). Therefore, let's say in the above example, you had to deposit 80,000 won 5) once you have deposited the 80,000 won again at the bank, it will charge you 2,000 won for every time you deposit the extra 80,000 won 6) you then deposit the 80,000 won, thus completing the total transaction\nOutput (C): You take a loan of 20,000 won from the local bank who charges you the interest rate of 6%. Let's say you repay the loan on a 1-month/10-month weekly schedule.

This week is the week to have a play with your numbers using this game. It is the month of January and there is a great reason for that. It\u2019s the beginning of NaBloPoMo and that means it\u2019s time to celebrate the numbers.\n\nAs always when it comes to reading I take a look at the questions to see how they are related to a number, and it all starts with \u20181\u2019. Today\u2019s question is \u201cNumber 1\u201d and we start with the word number 2 with the number 1 attached. This is the first question we have which makes it the first question we try to work out but that\u2019s exactly the reason we have it at the start of the week. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do in the days leading into this one but that\u2019s what you will be focusing on.\n\nThe next question is \u201cNumber 2\u201d and the first thing I try to do is work out what the number 2 has to do with the first question. You probably already have a good idea that they are linked but that doesn\u2019t stop us from trying. It doesn\u2019 t matter what it has to do with but that just pushes us forward. It feels natural for this reason to focus on \u201c2\u201d rather than just number 1.\n\nThis question and answer session will help you to become a bit more creative in your thinking and give you the extra push you are going to need when you get stuck with this one. It\u2019s going to take a bit of time so keep in mind that it\u2019s going to be a challenge. We should see this question answered in a few minutes.\n\nNow onto \u201cNumber 3\u201d and we take a look at what number 3 means in English. This is an English question and is tied to number 2. The question that we know that number 2 connects to number 3 does that mean the opposite then? We are going to concentrate on English as it\u2019s the easiest to learn and one of the easiest to use.

Input: 1,000 grams of honey 1,000 gram of water 1,000 gram of flour 2,000g sugar 4 liter milk 1,000 gram butter 1,000 gram cheese\nOutput: 1 liter butter 1 liter cheese\n\nInput: I heard that people in Japan collect the honey from bees as a source of income. How can I do this? Input: 500,000 bees 500,000 bees\nOutput: 5,000,000 bee honey 500,000 bees\n\nInput and Output:\n\nInput - I have a beehive that is about 2 year old. Are there benefits? - yes.\n\nOutput - Should I build a beehive? - it depends on your lifestyle and finances.\n\nYou can buy any number of packages of honey from the store but usually the package is in 5 grams portions and they would be about 100 per package. A single package would last about 4 weeks.\n\nYou can also buy a container with the same amount of honey inside. The container would be empty, however, the honey would last one year.\nThat's the best way to go, you would be amazed at the money you can save.\nBut you really have to try it for yourself:\n\nIf you need to save money, don't think about it. Just buy the honey in small amounts and put it in your fridge to finish off for yourself.\n\nYou can make honey in different ways. You can boil it down and then use it for the next meal or you can dehydrate it and leave it whole (like bees). Or you can boil it for a short period of time and then use the water that is left for the dehydrated honey.\n\nIf you buy some honey in bulk, you can get a lot of honey for less money. And the big advantage would be that you get honey that is not sold on the market. So if you don't like the way the honey is sold, you can even buy honey that has been stored and would then be more expensive than when it was bought.", "answer": "E: farmer's market"}

{"text": "What was the orthodox priest trying to do?\n\ninput: In your opinion, which of the following actions would be the most accurate or realistic way to stop the clergy sexually abusing children? A: forbid mass B: deny the priest indulgences C: ban the priest D: forbid his congregation e: forbid his parishioners F: forbid him from marrying\nOutput:Which of the following would be the most likely to be effective in stopping sexual abuse? A: make it more difficult for the priest to get rid of evidence B: limit the priest\u2019s free access to boys C: restrict where the priest can preach D: restrict access to boys and girls e: restrict access to priests\n\nInput:\nThe Roman Catholic Church does not have a formal sexual abuse problem. Yet, the problem is growing. The number of accusations increased significantly in the U.S. in recent years. What should be the Catholic response? A: deny accusations B: demand accountability by victims and victims\u2019 families C: require priests to report any known rumors of abuse by their staff to their superior\nOutput: Why does the Catholic church have sexual abuse issues? Why are priests allowed to abuse children?\n\nThe question is asking about the impact on priests of being \"concerned\" about the fact that their parishioner may be abused by pedophiles and covering it up; the obvious solution is to change Mass.\nIf priests have to get permission to hold Mass, then maybe priests aren't as concerned about paedophile pedophiles as they are with maintaining their sacred roles as religious figures.\n\nThis is one reason why priests should be allowed to hold Masses. If you feel compelled to cover up abuse in your parish or even outside it (like when you are at a function and suddenly a person is groping children under the age of 12), then you are less concerned about preventing pedophile sexual abuse of minors than you are about preserving a sacred religious role.\n\nThis is also a point to which I would respond if priests were not so often accused of sexual misconduct but they were. Maybe there should be a clear line separating clergy/priest and lay/non-clerical, so that if they sexually abuse a young male then they shouldn't be considered priest but a priest that has committed sexual abuse.\nThat way, there wouldn't be some vague problem of protecting \"sacred religious values\" or \"religious faith\" from sexually inclined priests, but rather an outright scandal of priests covering up sexual abuse. I believe that", "answer": "B: heretical"}

Moreover, because a building is an indoor space it can hold much more spectators.\n\nExample (4)\n\nSolution: The answer is B. The space inside the venue is less that the space outside. And the audience inside the venue will not be able to hear the performers outside because of the noise of the performing. But when it is outside the venue the audience will have the chance to hear the performers without disturbing the other spectators nearby.\n\nExample (5)\n\nSolution: Example (4) is incorrect. Because when the performing is being directed to the audience from a certain side, the audience will be able to hear it. But when the performing is being directional to the other side or from the opposite direction, the audience will not be able to.\n\nExample (6)\n\nSolution: A.

However, when they are being taken inside the venue, other people may get disturbed and may not be able to hear it (B). And the audience at that side that is taken inside the venue will not hear the other performances (C).

The radio helps bring the traffic to a complete stop!\n\nInput:In a race car there are three seats. The driver, the right front passenger, and the left front passenger. The driver has a choice of where the driver's seat goes when he or she sits in the car. The passengers can have a choice of who sits in the front seats of the race car. The people sitting in the left and right front seats are called drivers and passengers, respectively. If you sit in the driver's seat, then the passenger in the left and right rear seats has a choice of where to sit. If you sit in passenger, then the driver and passenger sit where they decide. To get into the driver's seat, the driver must lean forward and sit on one of the seats on the front of the car. The passengers' seats can only be leaned forward when the driver's seat door is opened. (In other words, the passenger's seat can't lean forward if it's open.) If the passenger on the left or right seat wishes to sit in the driver's lap, then that passenger must lean forward and rest his or her left hand on the driver's lap to make sure there is room over both of the driver's seats. The passenger standing up in the driver's seat can look around and look at the passengers to make sure there are enough seats available in the drivers' lap. To get out of the driver's seat, you must lean backward and sit on the seat that isn't in your driver's lap. (In other words the passenger's seat can only be leaned forward if it's open. If the passenger on the right or left seat wishes to put his or her right hand in the driver's lap to rest on it, then that passenger must hold his or her hand across the driver's lap or rest his or her left foot on the hand.

{"text": "A (probably) D B E (probably) C\n(Obviously it will also take longer than expected if both groomers cut the hair at once because it takes that long to completely cut, cut the hair and rinse, clean and style the hair while the groomer is actually applying the lather or conditioning product).\nOutput: A is the answer, you've guessed it.\nOutput: D is the true answer, it means that the grooming will be late because it doesn\u2019t happen as fast as hoped for. That the grooming schedule will be delayed. Which means that the groomers must finish cutting before they start applying the lather or the conditioner.\nOutput: E is the false answer, it means that none of the groomers start cutting their client's hair at this moment. They don\u2019t start until after the client is finished with their grooming. Which means that they don\u2019t cut the hair while the client is still on their hands and knees.\nOutput: That will definitely take some extra time. But since the client is on their hands and knees it shouldn\u2019t disrupt the timeline of the grooming exactly.\nOutput: That's really not what E means. It means that there may be some delay for the groomer to finish grooming because his/her hands should be used to pat, rub, and massage the customer's hair.\nOutput: That\u2019s still not the answer. It means waiting for the client to finish grooming.\nOutput: That means the grooming schedule will get delayed and since the client doesn\u2019t want to wait longer than they already have to wait, they'll come up with other solutions to get to their appointment on time. Like a haircut or some extra grooming time that they don\u2019ve scheduled.\nOutput: That might work. Maybe. And if it does, that\u2019s not all bad because it could free up more grooming time for the client.\nOutput: That could be a solution, but why will it just free up more of the groomer's time?\nOutput: That could also disrupt the grooming schedule.

Options: A: rent B: food C: food D: rent\nOutput: Rent $150 + rent $300 = $300 Food $250 + food $200 = $100 Rent $150 + rent 200 = $100\nSo if they had a food bank you can pay $250 of rent, and get $100 a month of food.\nA food bank would do the trick.\n\nInput:The cost of the meal plan at the U of M, an average of $35, per person every month, would be less than $120 per month, and it is still $1000 for all the meals, each month!\nOutput: $1500 in food = $1000 in rent + $100 in food = $500 for food, $900 = rent.\nSo paying $3000 a month would help a lot for an almost average meal, $500 a month would make a world of a difference.\n\nInput:Take the amount of the loan repayment fee, put it into food, and then subtract the food costs.\nOutput: The total cost of the meal plan per person is $1,000 for food, so when you subtract the debt repayment fee of $0.06 per meal, you have $1,000 in food.\n\nInput:How much food costs $1?

{"text": "Joy, valuable, early death, adventurous\n\nIn all these choices life can be seen either as a value-filled joy or a meaningful value, each containing both of these two options. In all these choices life is both important and valuable \u2013 just like value. When we decide we will not make all the choices, then only one of those three options is the one we make, but not all of them. Choices like joy, valuable, and early death are all possible in the same person living life as if those choices were not possible.\n\nIn practice, one must choose. If we are to live out the existence we have been given in life, then we must choose to do as much with that life as we can. Therefore the choices we make are ultimately valuable in the sense that they lead to fulfillment. Fulfilling our desires, and having experiences, activities, and projects that we are passionate about. This is our true life, the life we have been given by God and man to help make possible for us.\nIn order to accomplish fulfillment of every single of these desires we cannot necessarily choose the same or the simplest course. Choosing wisely must be a daily exercise which requires a great deal of reflection and analysis. But this reflection and analysis only serve to help us make our choices more wisely. If instead we merely go with the flow and chose what is easy rather than consider the consequences, then we will just make more of the same, the choices that lead to the same.\nThis is the core dilemma our universe now faces: how to choose wisely every single day, or each and every single lifetime? Which is the better choice: to let our lives run their course for us or to try to learn from the past, and from future experiences? To decide for a given moment whether to take the easy road or choose wisely? To decide what we should eat for dinner? Or perhaps to stop eating altogether and go to bed? Or to decide that even though a given moment might seem better than an other given moment, if we think about all of our past experiences, they would all be as good as our next moment? Choosing wisely is always the choice we make.\nIn the meantime there are many people around us who choose foolishly, whether deliberately or unwittingly. They choose the most common or easy options. They choose things that lead to more suffering than value, to suffering that is even more significant than pleasure, things that are just not worth the value to them. But even when we make wise choices,", "answer": "A: joy"}

{"text": "A: supermarket B: Pig C: Cow D: Refrigerator E: Store\n\nSolution:\nChoose which animal is the animal with the most milk produced compared to its size.\n(Ex: In size the cow and the pig are approximately the same, whereas the refrigerator is just slightly larger so they produce slightly more milk.\nSince the refrigerator has a volume of 56 l, the cow and the pig have equal volume and milk produced per unit of volume.)\n\n(Ex: Since the cow and the pig both have an equal volume, their milk will be 50% of the volume of a refrigerator, while the refrigerator may or may not have milk produced in it.\nThe refrigerator milk will weigh half as much since it is full of half as many empty spaces.)\n\nThe last number represents (1-3)^-5, the number of seconds between when the item is taken out of their original container and when they are eaten.\nIt has been calculated by dividing each number by the number of seconds for each specific product. For one product of two days old, 3.7 seconds. For another, 2.8 seconds. This gives us (1-3)/(2.8-2.7) =.25.\nThe number of seconds will be larger, (1-4), (1-3) or (1-2)^(5).\nTherefore, the milk and the cereal of a cow take a total of 54 seconds to get to the table. While it takes 42 seconds for cereal to get to the table, and the milk takes 48 seconds. The meat has a long time. The time it was in the container was. So the number of seconds and the number of seconds of each is 54 -.50 = 18 minutes.\n\nInput:What happens to the water of a cow?

Therefore, the answer is \"D\", since milk that is being drank today has not previously smelled of milk.\nHowever, if the answer is \"B\" (the milk was previously smelled of milk), then it is not an answer at all.

The bird that is too light to fly is not allowed to leave the zoo. He has to sit on the ground in a cage until another bird arrives that can carry him. How can he be taken back out?\nInput: A bird lands on the same spot again and tries to fly away. He reaches the farthest point from the spot he has touched before but cannot take off any further because he is too heavy.

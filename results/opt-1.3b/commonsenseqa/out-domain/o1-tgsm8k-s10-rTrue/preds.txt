Are there examples of other types of multiple choice assignments, besides simple question? Can you think of any other places where multiple choice can be used in an essay?<n><n>As for the question, the only single page multiple choice problem I ever encountered is this one:  As for essay, it should depend on the topic. If the topic involves some sort of social phenomenon, for example, "How to be politically progressive without offending others" or "Why should men not do the same things as women?" then using multiple choice in essay should be no problem at all.  If it just involves doing some research and writing a paper, then probably essay wouldn't fit the multiple choice paradigm at all.<n><n>As for the word count, maybe 10-15 pages with a single page essay. But essay should take a certain amount of planning and preparation of various parts of the argument.

Choices:  A: get smart B: boredom C: colds and flu D: taking tests E: spend time<n>Output:		 When kids are having trouble in class or can not pay attention, they should be encouraged to attend school. This will help them to concentrate and understand better.<n><n>The "question", "What do you know so far?" requires people to do what they know for certain in the previous question for. So what they know is "You get smart when you work on stuff". So the "question" is, if he spent his day working on math would he have gotten to his answer any sooner. The only way it makes any sense is if he also worked on other stuff.<n><n>But he could have got there faster, or faster than he already did on his own. This is what the previous question asks for. "For homework on this page, will you come to school each day and work on this problem with me?"<n><n>This only proves that he got smarter at school, not that it was all worthwhile. He was getting smart by his own efforts, and that is all that matters.<n><n>You could come up with an argument that all of Adam's schooling was an investment in his future, which is why he goes to school. But that doesn't prove anywhere that any of Adam's schooling was worth it, because he did not need to be there for that. What is worth it is if he learns more than he did before. He had to learn that math was fun, because he was stuck with homework most of his days. He wanted that as well. So why he spent most of his day on it as well. He wanted more than he needed.

He had just got out of the pool when suddenly lightning flashed across the sky, lightning raced down to the ground just beneath his play house, just as the child ran. The lights began to dim rapidly, and one minute later, the lights disappeared from view. The child walked into the shade of a tree, and turned on a light in the tree. It was pitch black in the tree except for a couple bulbs and two or three candles. The child put on a flashlight, which shone a tiny spotlight into the night sky (which did not glow) at random intervals. The child counted the number of lights which fell and appeared to shine. The child could see no lights above him, so he went on exploring. After a number of minutes he noticed that the sun had appeared over the horizon, and could see the sun and the earth in front of him. The child returned to the play house, and as he opened the door, the lightning from the storm returned and began to flood the play house. The little boy ran again towards a tree, and turned off the light in the tree. The light in the tree was just about out, and the little boy looked towards the starry sky. There was no sign of the lightning which had been striking the earth for the past few minutes. The little boy walked through the trees, and at last, found himself in a big, green field where he could see the trees from the sky, but not on the ground.

Choices:  A: active B: hunger C: in motion D: wakefulness E: lay down<n>Output:		 A<n><n>input:The table showed prices according to each company. One kilo of rice costs $12. How much did Adam paid?<n><n>output: It was 3.12.000 $. So the final answer is 3.12.000<n><n>This is a very stupid question and I don’t know why all people who answer it think it’s a smart one. The example is wrong… How am I supposed to know that a kilo cost $12? I just got three out of the blue. It doesn’t mean that the price has increased or decreased. I mean of cause they should say it costs $30 but not how much more, so in my scenario my question wasn’t useless.<n><n>You didn’t make any assumptions. The question was, “what was Adam paying for his groceries?” and you gave the price as a percentage, which you can’t really say exactly how much he spent on each of the items. I don’t think that answers the question correctly.<n><n>I did the math for you. In the same order that he would have had to buy 3 pieces of bread, he also bought 2 pieces of rice and two handfuls of vegetables, and he would only spend $18 on each of them. So, with those three items, he spent $18 on food. And of cause, it would have also had to be eaten before he would be able to afford anything else. So, my example, like yours, was technically incorrect, but it still answers the question correctly, just in the incorrect way.<n><n>Actually, my example was exactly correct: The problem was that I didn’t find out if he was using the kilo or the gram or the pound. A kilo is a gram, so unless Adam said that he was buying all the food in one go, which I didn’t see anywhere, he would probably have to pay $6.32 for the bread. (That’s the only way to buy the food in one go.)<n><n>Yeah, I can see that. That’s an example of how it’s technically incorrect, not of how it’ll be used or misused. I guess it’s the same way with “one loaf, one pot,” too. That said, in this case, I think I was doing better than the average person, because the $18 isn�

His mother-in-law, who is already very sick, gives him her best attempt at speaking to him and says she will get that money once he gets back. The family, however has to pay $70 plus about $50 for rent because they are renting out a second home and also have another one that they live in when the wife is not there.

At birth, she is taken to the hospital for delivery. Her doctors think she must have a heart defect because she is in pain. The first miscarriage occurs at 4 weeks. The doctors think if they remove the fetus now, the woman will have another miscarriage. The child is delivered and has trouble breathing. The doctors say that the cause of the failure of the fetus to survive may be a brain defect. It’s too early to try surgery, they advise, because the brain does not develop until the toddler is 12 or so. So the baby is put up for adoption. The woman thinks to herself: “Why would they keep a baby that isn’t mine?” She then becomes pregnant again 4 weeks later and decides to have the baby again. She knows that the fetus will not survive this time. She calls a doctor friend and, while talking on the phone, makes a plan to deliver the baby for $1 if she isn’t able to find a good home for the child. She goes to the hospital on her own; the fetus is delivered and the baby survives.

Output:<n>a. Boring<n>b: Cheap<n>c: Useless, it has been calculated by the computer<n>d: Average<n><n>Example 1:<n>Answer: A milk vendor sells 500 gallons of milk for less than the average price $0.55 per 100 grams.<n><n>Input:<n>A milk vendor earns money from selling 500 gallons of milk.<n>B. Is it possible to sell a gallon of milk at the average price $0?<n>Output:<n>A. Yes<n>B. No<n>C. The average price is $0.48<n>D. The cheapest way to get this price is for customers to pay $1.00<n><n>Examples 2 &3:<n>Answer: A customer comes to the milk vendor and orders 500 gallons. The total cost for him is $52.00. Since the vendor can sell a gallon for $0.58 per 100 grams, A has earned $52.00 + $8.90=$59.00. His total price is $60, and since the average price is $0, $60.90 is the minimum. He has to pay $4.80 for insurance and $9.00 for taxes. So the total of $59.00 - $10.90=$39.60, less taxes and insurance. Then he can only pay for the milk $9.50 in exchange for his 500 grams of milk - $9.50 = $53.30. Since he has to pay $2.50 for insurance which is a discount compared to other vendors, the total price is still $40, less taxes and insurance, so the total of $40 - $37.30=$36.30. So he can only buy $40 worth of milk and pay $4.20 per gallon, or $3.80 for the milk.<n><n>Input:A:A customer arrives at a shop and asks for coffee.

So the final answer is 46.<n><n>Answer:A A retailer pays $4. The merchant only knows that this amount is more than his cost of goods sold (the price difference). It's hard to say how much will be sent out but I can't see the reason why he wouldn't send some out (probably to other stores in his area).<n><n>In the first case I'm not sure why the merchant won't put some out in return.<n><n>Answer:B in each case the retailer has to pay the difference in the price (5*$2-6=4) + the merchant gets $2 (5+2x$2 = 10).<n>Answer:A it depends how much does the merchant make/gild/sell/whatever that $4.<n>Answer:C in the first case (in order to pay the merchant), and in each case the merchant doesn't know that $4 is more than the cost of the product sold to the seller.<n><n>Answer:C In the second case the merchant does know that it's more that the cost sold and therefore should gild it back. (It's much easier for him to gild than write down the exact cost of the entire transaction)<n><n>Answer:B It makes no sense to me how the merchant could pay more for the product if it was more expensive in the first case and still be able to sell to the retailer. I think the merchant can just write down the amount and send them to Adam.<n>Answer:C The merchant knows that the value is more than the cost and he needs

What do you think of humans? Answers:<n><n>Input:A scientist who works on a scientific project is working with her supervisor when the supervisor asks her to produce something to improve the efficiency of a test. The scientist is working for weeks and weeks and months on the research and is finally able to solve the math problem to her satisfaction. The scientist finally has the solution to her problem and she produces a device that is 30 times less inefficient than her previous device. She then goes to submit her work for publication. The publisher says the device was an improvement, but that the scientific community is too skeptical that an obvious improvement could be possible. The scientist is then fired because she can't convince the scientific community that the improvement is real. What does the scientist do?<n>Input:I am an engineer. What's your opinion of engineers? How would you rate our job skills?<n>Output: I'm a very honest engineer. When I'm designing a new product, I don't like to change my designs because there is usually a problem with the design and a quick fix will not work, I only make changes if I have to. My job is to take the best ideas and implement them into something that will be marketable. Most engineers are honest, and work hard, but some are dishonest. A lot of people take the easy way out by modifying an existing product that uses the same process or takes another design from a different competitor. Engineering does help you stay on top of the latest developments in technology to stay ahead of the game, but it is difficult to hide the fact that some of your actions will cause harm to others.<n>Input:What does computer programming entail? And what is the biggest hurdle people with engineering degrees face before starting their careers?<n>Output: I can't say I've ever had to take a programming course. I've only taken a couple computer science classes. There is very little you can do without knowing how to program. If you aren't a programmer, it's difficult to start, but once you start, it's an easy thing to get used to. Software engineers can use a bunch of different languages and tools depending on the job, the problem, and the budget.<n><n>Input:What should you do if

In addition, even if you had played against a competent opponent in the past, there are still dozens of moves to think about, each with at least an elementary possibility. You cannot calculate in your head precisely what may happen, so you need some way to know what to do if you do happen to lose.<n><n>The most popular way to know what to bet and when is by placing a winning bet. There are games in which you simply try to win as quickly as you can. The less experienced you are, the more difficult and boring these games become, but they are still useful. For example, you could learn to play a game of Go so that you can try to win the game and the game and the game in succession. There, in each position, there are hundreds of possible moves, so you will never get caught out with an opponent who is much better. To play a game of Go it is easy to memorize random numbers which can make random guesses. The point is to win in the fastest way possible by doing this, by doing what is called the "best bet". In order to bet on your side of the chess game you will not notice that you have lost at any point for many years. Each game of Go has its own rules: You can get very lucky as soon as you find a good pattern which you are able to learn. And you can lose on your opponent's side very quickly, but the pattern you are trying to learn can remain for a long time, and if you get lucky, it will be easier for you to win again. Finally, there can be a pattern which you are unable to learn because the rules of chess are hard to comprehend and you have to guess or look at a board a million times until you can understand it all.<n><n>You can think of strategy for a single game of Go. However, in a game with a large number of possible moves, some of them have the strongest probability of winning: the moves

Choices:  A: learning B: painful memories C: thinking D: awe inspiring E: pleasure<n>Output:		 How would you decide?<n><n>B. Anecdotal learning has its drawbacks but it is still an education and it helps with memory formation, and it is sometimes beneficial.<n><n>The problem is with memories. There are certain things that are just more likely to be recalled when you are with other people than just reading it out yourself.<n><n>You can learn something without seeing it yourself. You might see it in a story or some video if you care enough.<n><n>I find this an interesting article. While reading this, you could see how the technology would work for the most part, but the example seems more true-to-life. How does an e-reader work? How could you tell? What if someone put a gun to your head and said "go see this" to you.<n>It would be more like, "Oh, there's a story that someone gave me with this book that talks about this. It looks pretty interesting." and you go to the library to find it.<n><n>I think your idea would have worked just as well with a movie or television show, though.<n><n>Or any other tangible item where the memories don't occur by themselves (say, it was someone who gives you this note), but you get to take a piece of it, and put it on your body, and then there are other people that know this piece of information as well. (or even you do) Then, you make copies of that, and that's how some of the information gets stored.<n>Again, it's more like the film or TV version or maybe this e-reader is more akin to this.<n><n>And even then, there are other books, magazines, newspapers, and even books about books which have pictures that are easier to relate to.<n>For some, seeing those things is quite a novelty - for some, it's just another everyday text.<n>I think there are two types of people. Those who will see their memories as facts, and those who see them as information.<n><n>This article has two points:<n>\- It uses the word artifact in the second sentence in the most condescending way.<n>\- Even if this is accurate, what then? (I don't watch the news so I know nothing about it)<n><n>A lot of people use it in the past tense.<n><n>That I will never be able to see with the naked eye. The fact that he mentions not being able to watch news gives a strong impression that he actually does not

You score a point for each correct charade that you draw and lose a point for each incorrect charade.<n>So the points that you score and the points that your partner scores are given as follows:<n><n>If the partner gets a point, you get two points.<n><n>If your partner gets a point, the last other person in the game also gets two points.<n><n>The first person to play the letter wins, as the last person in the game is eliminated.<n><n>Suppose you are playing two games of charades with three other players.<n><n>In the first game, word-chasers are divided into two teams, A and B.<n>Each player draws a sheet of cards and has their words written down on it; teams A and B compete against one another in the game, in which each word has a certain number of letters. The letter ‘D’ and ‘C’ compete in this game as well. The word-chasers are allowed to play their letters one at a time, and the games lasts for a time of fifteen seconds. Each player gets one point. In the second game, word-chaser have their letters written down separately, and players A and B compete against each other in the game, in in which each letter has a certain number of (usually three) letters. The word-chaser get one point each if their card is correct, and two points if their card is incorrectly written.<n><n>The third player, called the ‘cheerleader’, is in charge of all things related to the game, such as: the number of letters in the word, the number of charades a player has managed to draw or that

How much money could it make? (no input needed)<n>Output: $14,100<n>What would you call this business?<n><n>Input:<n>1) The price of milk is $5 per cubic centimetre, and the price of sugar is $0 per cubic centimetre. So to make a kilo of milk one has to pay $5 per cubic centimeter.<n>2) Let's take the amount of sugar per one kilo of milk, and multiply it by 5 kilogram per day. So to make 5 kilograms of sugar per one kilogram of milk you have to pay $5 per kilogram of milk. So,<n>3) Let's say one kilogram of sugar costs $0 per kilogram of milk, so then we can make $500 per kilogram of sugar per 24 hours instead of $1,500 per kilogram of milk per 24 hours. So,<n>4) Now we have to take the number of kilojoules per one kilogram of sugar and divide it by five. The result will be $6 per kilojoule. So,<n>5) That's it, the kilojoule price, the sugar cost is $5 per kilogram per day.<n>6)Now we have our kilojoules per kilogram of sugar. That's how much money you can make per one kilo of sugar.<n>7)The amount of kilojoules/ kilogram of sugar is $.0565.<n>8)So every time you pour 100 kilojoules one kilo of sugar, you can earn $18 or $190 per day.<n>9)That's $18 per 8 hours or $190 per 8 days.<n>10)If we look at our kilojoule, we see that for each kilojoule there are 9,400 kilojoules.<n>11)Now we have to make our kilojoules/kilogram of sugar per day.<n>12)Let's say it cost $0.50 for 50 kilojoules. That's 0.50 of a cent more per kilojoule than the other kilojoules. So,<n>13) For a kilojoule of 50 kilojou

Where might it be? Choices:  A: new york B: big city C: town D: idaho E: shopping mall<n>Output:		It is in New York according to you answer.<n><n>The first example contains a mistake. The department is not located in downtown New York. Downtown (NY) is a name given to the geographical area around Manhattan, that is, the central/western part of the territory of New York City. This is the part that the department store is located in, although it is only a part of it: there is also a much larger neighbourhood called Chelsea and many other parts of Manhattan outside of Manhattan. Hence it is impossible to give the actual street the name of the particular department store because there is no such street. Instead you will get the area code to the nearest major city if you give the address as one of those, but I do not allow it.<n><n>The second example contains a mistake as well: Adam made a mistake in choosing two kilograms of nuts, and three kilograms of dried fruits. For this, make sure that you do not give any wrong ones. A kilo of nuts cost $25, whereas one kilogram of dried fruits cost $5. So your answer is that $25 - 5=$5 * 3=$10 = 8 and $5 - 8=$5 * 3=$2=$8.<n><n>I will be posting the actual answers soon.

A team will include people from 4 or more students.<n><n>The instructions I gave them were to place the 3 balls that they got into their team mates' team boxes. After everyone was sorted into their team boxes I put them all somewhere safe on the wall. Then I introduced 5 more balls in each box, and had them choose the ball that they thought was most similar to their team member. The person's task was to find the ball closest to their team member and give that ball to that team member. Then they counted the number of balls with their team members. Each student was to decide the number of balls they wanted to give the team member. For example, if they want to give 3 to the person, they could divide 3 by 5 =3, or, if they want 3 to the person, then they could divide 3 by 4 =12, or they could try to give it to 2 of the teammates, because each teammate could get 2 of them.<n><n>I then had every student write a name. Then, I had those students count the number of balls that they

Answers:<n>Option A: Do nothing.  Take the clock out and place it in another room.  (Maybe your parents don't have clock radios or you get bored in the morning.)  If you see a clock in another room or hear a radio, you will be in a dangerous and potentially dangerous situation.  (Yes, this is a terrible idea and there will be people who get hurt over the 2 minute window, but the time is too close for us to be safe.)<n>Option B: Put the clock back in one room. (You will be able to stop time, but if you do now you will be stuck with yourself.)  You may get bored, but you may also go outside, but that was not my idea.  And since we know we will be saved, there is no problem to do this.<n>Option C: Go to town and buy a clock radio to take with you (since it is possible that a radio may not reach this location or you are bored).  But don't go in to town because, as you can see, you don't get my point why there was no need to go to town.  But if you stay away from town the time on the clock will stop.<n>Option D: Make an art project to make this situation less dangerous.  The clock is a great tool for doing this, but you can make many art projects to add more time.  Like using the clock as a clock.  Just don't talk to anyone before or after.  This one may be too fun for some to do.

Answer: When inflation was high and exports were low, the US government had few alternative means of financing the massive amount of debt it was carrying. So they went into debt, selling bonds, that would later be paid back in full by the export surplus. As a result, the dollar skyrocketed during the 19th century. The end of that boom made an already shaky dollar even more so. People were more and more concerned about their money leaving their country if the country started to lose interest (that interest now comes from the US government). As a result, many countries adopted the dollar as their benchmark currency in hopes it would become stronger. As long as the dollar stays strong, the US government will continue to spend money. This, of course, means the money will keep coming back and inflation will be contained. This kept inflation in check and has been a strong reason for the strong dollar. Today the US government is at a similar risk of running out of money. In other words, the dollar will eventually be weak again and more debt will come to bear. The only people who will be making money right now are financial advisors, who will probably be charged as much as 15% interest to take people into these risky investments. But the worst may be yet to come. You can already see signs of a possible dollar crash in the real estate market, where prices have begun to fall. The dollar may be the best thing to blame for this downturn in real estate prices, which are already under considerable pressure. It is not clear when we will see more drastic price falls in housing, as the price crash in other markets seems to be bottoming out. But we can be certain that prices will continue to fall for the rest of this decade and for several more years. It will be only after the subprime mortgage crisis is over and the dollar has recovered that we will see a true housing bust. You can see the problems this will cause the government and banks in the ongoing bank bailout. In addition, if the

If there is none, it is most certainly a cold, and antibiotics will give relief for these conditions. B) If the patient does not respond to antibiotics within the first hour of taking the antibiotic, the doctor will usually repeat the prescription two or several times before deciding further.<n>Input: A)  If a child with a fever of 49°C is in danger of hypothermia, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics to stop the fever. At this point, there is a high likelihood that the child will be brought to the hospital in an intensive care unit, where he or she will remain for the majority of the treatment. To guarantee that an antibiotic is taken at the correct time, the patient will have to be seen three times (including once to get the antibiotic, if necessary). B)  One or two times a day, the doctor will prescribe a small dosage of a low-potency flu vaccine. The vaccine will give the patient the protection it receives during the actual influenza epidemic, but in the meantime, the vaccine protects the patient from the flu's more serious complications. If the patient comes to the doctor with less than normal warmth, he will likely receive

The answer is D.<n>2) You're getting 5/4 and 3/7 (2 is only 1, right?) or 4/6 and 2 (1 is 6 and 2 is 4, but 3=6 so you get 3/2, right?) or 6/5 and 5 (4 is 4, right?) 2 is more than 1, so you get 6/5. 3 is less than 1 but more than 2 so 4+2=6 so 3+2=7 (3/3 or 3/2 are equivalent to 7, right?). 4 is less than 1 and 3 is more than 2 so 3/4 is less but 4/3 is more than 2 so 4/2 is less but 3/2 is more than 1 so 3/4 is more than 2. So you get 8 or 6 (6/5 is equal to 8, so 0, correct?) because 5 is more than 10. You also get 6/5 for 4/3 (4/3 is equivalent to 5, right?) so 1=6 and 6=5. 8 or 6 is equal to 6. The answer is 6+7 + 8 (4+3=7, 8 is even if 1+6 is equal).

He is interested enough. He buys the parcel with his own money, gets the papers registered and builds himself and his children a house. He thinks nothing else of it. Until he is surprised by a parcel of land being sold for $40,000. He wonders how much he will get paid. After being shown the price the buyer asks him to give him half of the half he bought. He doesn't hesitate but gives it to him. His reply is that it is his business. The buyer gets angry that he has a lawyer, and calls him a scum bag. That makes him want to find out more about him. He goes to his neighbours - the people he bought the property from. All but one have very strong opinions about this man. They talk about him all day long. The one neighbour, who had not talked about him for years, says that they have never seen this man before. The lawyer in question happens to live nearby. He goes to his home to find out what his friend is doing. The one neighbour goes over to his room, says he is just getting ready to go to bed. The two have a very heated discussion and the neighbour goes outside and tells them about the land purchase. That gets many angry responses. The lawyer comes over to the house and tells him to tell people not to talk bad about him or the land. He gives the lawyer $4000 for legal advice.<n>Output:<n>What kind of man is Adam?

He bought it like this: There's a long, unoccupied stretch of highway that runs between where he lives and work. It's basically a dirt road, and he's only taking it to work anyway because work is boring. It's his car he loves, and after all this time he's never even driven it. Recently, he started thinking about driving it. Not because he loves his car, just because he'd like to spend a weekend in the car at the very least, for the sake of driving it. While in his car, he gets the idea for this project. It might be a novel, or any number of different projects, actually. He has no desire to actually build the thing. It's way too old for that, he's too lazy to clean it up and it's not a project he's interested in. But he still likes driving it, and he likes the idea of it being in a shop, so he's gonna build it. He buys some cheap parts, which is the way all projects should be, and starts. Slowly he works on it, keeping it clean and simple, until he is satisfied that he actually has the parts for it. For something he doesn't actually believe in, he decides to put it on this blog, so others can enjoy it, too.<n><n>Input:In a large field, there lives a large, brown cow.

Choices:  A: kept at accountant B: purse C: desk drawer D: bank E: keeping track of expenses<n>Output:		 I did not leave a book this time, I did not bring a book with me at the time or at home.<n><n>Input (A): You need to buy a loaf of bread at a market for 50,000 won. At an ATM you need to withdraw only 30,000 won. The ATM machine does not accept 50,000, so it charges you 50,000 won. Therefore: 1) you have to go back home where you have your phone and change the amount to 60,000 won 2) once you have finished the payment, the bank charges you an extra fee for the withdrawal 3) you then have to make a deposit again at the bank to withdraw the additional 60,000 won 4) the bank may charge you an additional fee for the deposit of the 60,000 won. Therefore, let's say you had to deposit all 70,000 won. In that case you need to travel to the market 10 times, so you still have to pay the extra 30,000 won on your way to the market. So your final destination is:<n>Input (B): The bank charges you the amount of 20,000 won when you use your foreign ATM card at the foreign branch. That's equal to 20,000 won for each time you use the ATM card 4) once you have finished checking the amount you have, the bank charges you the amount you have deducted for the fees (in the above example, the bank charges you 2,000 won per transaction). Therefore, let's say in the above example, you had to deposit 80,000 won 5) once you have deposited the 80,000 won again at the bank, it will charge you 2,000 won for every time you deposit the extra 80,000 won 6) you then deposit the 80,000 won, thus completing the total transaction<n>Output (C): You take a loan of 20,000 won from the local bank who charges you the interest rate of 6%. Let's say you repay the loan on a 1-month/10-month weekly schedule. So in this scenario let's assume that your interest rate is 6% and let's say that you had to repay your loan by 10th of the 6th week. So the total interest payment would be: (6%)/(10) = 24,000 won. So let's say that it costs you 24,000 won to take the loan.<n>Input (D): You are using your foreign ATM card at your local branch. After withdrawing 100,000 won, you

How much would you have to pay for a cow to get rid of it all (with the bones still inside)?<n>output: The most common method of getting rid of a cow is letting it starve, then just letting it rot.<n><n>Input:One animal is killed and its parts taken apart for food. It weighs 40 kg. This meat cost $10, so it had a cost of $6.50. How much per person do you usually get?<n>Output:The cow was killed for meat, and it wasn't really a whole cow, for it weighs just 60 kg. The skin is worth $7 alone, that's an extra profit of $5 of meat per person. If we didn't kill the cow it would weigh just 65 kg, and it would be worth $5.30. You would get $6.25 per person for the meat, and $5.50 for the skin.<n>It isn't really fair to see 1 animal as a unit. It is worth so much more, just because the meat is so much cheaper.<n><n>Input: 1 kg of flour gives a person a lot of stuff, but how much does one kilogram of flour actually give?

The trip took him 45 minutes, and when it was finished he walked in his house which took only 5 minutes. He unpacked his bags which weighed a similar amount to the weight of everything bag. He then gave 3 kg nuts to the people at the store, who said, "Sir, we will give you 2 kg worth of free nuts (this is a joke)" and left. When John reached the train station he took a cab which only had 1 seat. He quickly put everything in the passenger seat and then asked the cab driver where he would go next. He was told, "To the toilet." He said: "This is very nice. I would like to have that." So the driver told him he would travel in the cab for free. He found a comfortable seat which wasn't that big, the driver picked two pieces of luggage from the trunk and put them in the seat. John sat and started to enjoy the ride. "What is the cab going to do with the extra luggage?" he asked the driver. "You know, when we were stopped, it's the luggage that we had to handle, but now we can go on our way. So we can have the second piece of luggage before we reach home." He gave John's last piece of luggage to the driver, and then opened the trunk. Everything inside the luggage was gone, except for one piece of luggage which held a little note that said, "I am sorry, I am a thief." John sat there for a while, and then got up and went straight for the driver: "Excuse me, I believe that is yours, and there is something else in there!" So the driver gave him the bag with the note, and in it was an extra bag with another note inside. The driver picked it up and carried it out. He said, "Sir, I am sorry to have to break the news to you, but I am going to get rid of both of these bags now, because they make me so unhappy that I do not want to put them in the car anymore!" John got out and gave the other bag to the cab driver. The driver gave it to John, and as soon as they entered the office his face became very sad.

It is the month of January and there is a great reason for that. It’s the beginning of NaBloPoMo and that means it’s time to celebrate the numbers.<n><n>As always when it comes to reading I take a look at the questions to see how they are related to a number, and it all starts with ‘1’. Today’s question is “Number 1” and we start with the word number 2 with the number 1 attached. This is the first question we have which makes it the first question we try to work out but that’s exactly the reason we have it at the start of the week. It doesn’t matter what you do in the days leading into this one but that’s what you will be focusing on.<n><n>The next question is “Number 2” and the first thing I try to do is work out what the number 2 has to do with the first question. You probably already have a good idea that they are linked but that doesn’t stop us from trying. It doesn’ t matter what it has to do with but that just pushes us forward. It feels natural for this reason to focus on “2” rather than just number 1.<n><n>This question and answer session will help you to become a bit more creative in your thinking and give you the extra push you are going to need when you get stuck with this one. It’s going to take a bit of time so keep in mind that it’s going to be a challenge. We should see this question answered in a few minutes.<n><n>Now onto “Number 3” and we take a look at what number 3 means in English. This is an English question and is tied to number 2. The question that we know that number 2 connects to number 3 does that mean the opposite then? We are going to concentrate on English as it’s the easiest to learn and one of the easiest to use. So let’s get started.<n><n>Now onto the next question “Number 4” which is “Number 4’s” link to

Or you can boil it for a short period of time and then use the water that is left for the dehydrated honey.<n><n>If you buy some honey in bulk, you can get a lot of honey for less money. And the big advantage would be that you get honey that is not sold on the market. So if you don't like the way the honey is sold, you can even buy honey that has been stored and would then be more expensive than when it was bought.

A: forbid mass B: deny the priest indulgences C: ban the priest D: forbid his congregation e: forbid his parishioners F: forbid him from marrying<n>Output:Which of the following would be the most likely to be effective in stopping sexual abuse? A: make it more difficult for the priest to get rid of evidence B: limit the priest’s free access to boys C: restrict where the priest can preach D: restrict access to boys and girls e: restrict access to priests<n><n>Input:<n>The Roman Catholic Church does not have a formal sexual abuse problem. Yet, the problem is growing. The number of accusations increased significantly in the U.S. in recent years. What should be the Catholic response? A: deny accusations B: demand accountability by victims and victims’ families C: require priests to report any known rumors of abuse by their staff to their superior<n>Output: Why does the Catholic church have sexual abuse issues? Why are priests allowed to abuse children?<n><n>The question is asking about the impact on priests of being "concerned" about the fact that their parishioner may be abused by pedophiles and covering it up; the obvious solution is to change Mass.<n>If priests have to get permission to hold Mass, then maybe priests aren't as concerned about paedophile pedophiles as they are with maintaining their sacred roles as religious figures.<n><n>This is one reason why priests should be allowed to hold Masses. If you feel compelled to cover up abuse in your parish or even outside it (like when you are at a function and suddenly a person is groping children under the age of 12), then you are less concerned about preventing pedophile sexual abuse of minors than you are about preserving a sacred religious role.<n><n>This is also a point to which I would respond if priests were not so often accused of sexual misconduct but they were. Maybe there should be a clear line separating clergy/priest and lay/non-clerical, so that if they sexually abuse a young male then they shouldn't be considered priest but a priest that has committed sexual abuse.<n>That way, there wouldn't be some vague problem of protecting "sacred religious values" or "religious faith" from sexually inclined priests, but rather an outright scandal of priests covering up sexual abuse. I believe that

The next morning, after breakfast, the two of them went down to where the thief was still lurking, and discovered he had left his tool. They then searched for the thief, but he had not yet returned the stolen tool.

There were other courses I was interested in but I knew that if I didn’t get a job in the first two years of university, that it would be impossible to save up enough money for university. And I wanted to be close to home. I knew that it would not be possible with full-time work (and I was not getting any anyway so who was going to let me have my time to myself?). So, it was

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input:Where would you find performers on a platform in public? Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n>Output:		<n><n>Example (3)<n><n>Solution:The answer is A. Because an arena is an outdoor venue, it can hold much more people. Moreover, because a building is an indoor space it can hold much more spectators.<n><n>Example (4)<n><n>Solution: The answer is B. The space inside the venue is less that the space outside. And the audience inside the venue will not be able to hear the performers outside because of the noise of the performing. But when it is outside the venue the audience will have the chance to hear the performers without disturbing the other spectators nearby.<n><n>Example (5)<n><n>Solution: Example (4) is incorrect. Because when the performing is being directed to the audience from a certain side, the audience will be able to hear it. But when the performing is being directional to the other side or from the opposite direction, the audience will not be able to.<n><n>Example (6)<n><n>Solution: A. When the performers are being directed from the outside of the venue (A), the audience at that side of the venue will not be disturbed and will be able to hear the performances. However, when they are being taken inside the venue, other people may get disturbed and may not be able to hear it (B). And the audience at that side that is taken inside the venue will not hear the other performances (C). And those people who are moved inside may not hear a performer that is directed to them from a certain side. A result; B, which seems like a more practical result of the problem, is considered more commonly.<n><n>Example (7)<n><n>Solution: B. When the performers are taking turns as part of a group (B), the audience who are part of the group will be able to hear one performer at a time. However, the audience who are not part of the group may not be able to. A result; not the correct answer can be given.<n><n>Example (8)<n><n>Solution: C. When the performers are taken inside the venue (C), they will have a chance to hear the other performers who are being taken outside (D) without disturbing those people who are not part of that group. The people who are not part are not counted towards this group.<n><n>Example (9)<n><n>Solution: D.

The seat belts and the breaks help stop the car from going too fast. The radio helps bring the traffic to a complete stop!<n><n>Input:In a race car there are three seats. The driver, the right front passenger, and the left front passenger. The driver has a choice of where the driver's seat goes when he or she sits in the car. The passengers can have a choice of who sits in the front seats of the race car. The people sitting in the left and right front seats are called drivers and passengers, respectively. If you sit in the driver's seat, then the passenger in the left and right rear seats has a choice of where to sit. If you sit in passenger, then the driver and passenger sit where they decide. To get into the driver's seat, the driver must lean forward and sit on one of the seats on the front of the car. The passengers' seats can only be leaned forward when the driver's seat door is opened. (In other words, the passenger's seat can't lean forward if it's open.) If the passenger on the left or right seat wishes to sit in the driver's lap, then that passenger must lean forward and rest his or her left hand on the driver's lap to make sure there is room over both of the driver's seats. The passenger standing up in the driver's seat can look around and look at the passengers to make sure there are enough seats available in the drivers' lap. To get out of the driver's seat, you must lean backward and sit on the seat that isn't in your driver's lap. (In other words the passenger's seat can only be leaned forward if it's open. If the passenger on the right or left seat wishes to put his or her right hand in the driver's lap to rest on it, then that passenger must hold his or her hand across the driver's lap or rest his or her left foot on the hand. The driver can now reach his or her hand down to place it on the passenger's hand on the driver's seat. The passenger cannot place his or her hand in the driver's top left corner or hold his or her foot on the driver's lap when the driver wants to get out of the driver seat.) If a car's airbag is activated, then the passenger must lean forward and press the "X" to the right. If the airbag is not activated, then the passenger can

(2) If the family were still renting the same room-sharer out, how long ago would their decision have become outdated? (3) The family’s decision to rent it out to a room-stayer for ten years is not relevant to the question, but if they were to sell it to a house owner for a period of five years, how far into the future would their house sale become outdated? (4) For a number of reasons they cannot afford to accept the reduced rent and the family has a plan of moving on to a new apartment but they decide to extend the time to ten years.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input:What happens to the next appointment when a grooming takes longer than expected? Choices:  A: injury B: beauty C: late D: mistakes E: annoyed<n>Output:		A (probably) D B E (probably) C<n>(Obviously it will also take longer than expected if both groomers cut the hair at once because it takes that long to completely cut, cut the hair and rinse, clean and style the hair while the groomer is actually applying the lather or conditioning product).<n>Output: A is the answer, you've guessed it.<n>Output: D is the true answer, it means that the grooming will be late because it doesn’t happen as fast as hoped for. That the grooming schedule will be delayed. Which means that the groomers must finish cutting before they start applying the lather or the conditioner.<n>Output: E is the false answer, it means that none of the groomers start cutting their client's hair at this moment. They don’t start until after the client is finished with their grooming. Which means that they don’t cut the hair while the client is still on their hands and knees.<n>Output: That will definitely take some extra time. But since the client is on their hands and knees it shouldn’t disrupt the timeline of the grooming exactly.<n>Output: That's really not what E means. It means that there may be some delay for the groomer to finish grooming because his/her hands should be used to pat, rub, and massage the customer's hair.<n>Output: That’s still not the answer.

Options: A: rent B: food C: food D: rent<n>Output: Rent $150 + rent $300 = $300 Food $250 + food $200 = $100 Rent $150 + rent 200 = $100<n>So if they had a food bank you can pay $250 of rent, and get $100 a month of food.<n>A food bank would do the trick.<n><n>Input:The cost of the meal plan at the U of M, an average of $35, per person every month, would be less than $120 per month, and it is still $1000 for all the meals, each month!<n>Output: $1500 in food = $1000 in rent + $100 in food = $500 for food, $900 = rent.<n>So paying $3000 a month would help a lot for an almost average meal, $500 a month would make a world of a difference.<n><n>Input:Take the amount of the loan repayment fee, put it into food, and then subtract the food costs.<n>Output: The total cost of the meal plan per person is $1,000 for food, so when you subtract the debt repayment fee of $0.06 per meal, you have $1,000 in food.<n><n>Input:How much food costs $1?

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input:What does someone living life fully feel? Choices:  A: joy B: valuable C: happiness D: early death E: adventurous<n>Output:		 Joy, valuable, early death, adventurous<n><n>In all these choices life can be seen either as a value-filled joy or a meaningful value, each containing both of these two options. In all these choices life is both important and valuable – just like value. When we decide we will not make all the choices, then only one of those three options is the one we make, but not all of them. Choices like joy, valuable, and early death are all possible in the same person living life as if those choices were not possible.<n><n>In practice, one must choose. If we are to live out the existence we have been given in life, then we must choose to do as much with that life as we can. Therefore the choices we make are ultimately valuable in the sense that they lead to fulfillment. Fulfilling our desires, and having experiences, activities, and projects that we are passionate about. This is our true life, the life we have been given by God and man to help make possible for us.<n>In order to accomplish fulfillment of every single of these desires we cannot necessarily choose the same or the simplest course. Choosing wisely must be a daily exercise which requires a great deal of reflection and analysis. But this reflection and analysis only serve to help us make our choices more wisely. If instead we merely go with the flow and chose what is easy rather than consider the consequences, then we will just make more of the same, the choices that lead to the same.<n>This is the core dilemma our universe now faces: how to choose wisely every single day, or each and every single lifetime? Which is the better choice: to let our lives run their course for us or to try to learn from the past, and from future experiences? To decide for a given moment whether to take the easy road or choose wisely? To decide what we should eat for dinner? Or perhaps to stop eating altogether and go to bed? Or to decide that even though a given moment might seem better than an other given moment, if we think about all of our past experiences, they would all be as good as our next moment? Choosing wisely is always the choice we make.<n>In the meantime there are many people around us who choose foolishly, whether deliberately or unwittingly. They choose the most common or easy options. They choose things that lead to more suffering than value, to suffering that is even more significant than pleasure, things that are just not worth the value to them. But even when we make wise choices,

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input:What animal produces milk? Choices:  A: supermarket B: pig C: cow D: refrigerator E: store<n>Output:		 A: supermarket B: Pig C: Cow D: Refrigerator E: Store<n><n>Solution:<n>Choose which animal is the animal with the most milk produced compared to its size.<n>(Ex: In size the cow and the pig are approximately the same, whereas the refrigerator is just slightly larger so they produce slightly more milk.<n>Since the refrigerator has a volume of 56 l, the cow and the pig have equal volume and milk produced per unit of volume.)<n><n>(Ex: Since the cow and the pig both have an equal volume, their milk will be 50% of the volume of a refrigerator, while the refrigerator may or may not have milk produced in it.<n>The refrigerator milk will weigh half as much since it is full of half as many empty spaces.)<n><n>The last number represents (1-3)^-5, the number of seconds between when the item is taken out of their original container and when they are eaten.<n>It has been calculated by dividing each number by the number of seconds for each specific product. For one product of two days old, 3.7 seconds. For another, 2.8 seconds. This gives us (1-3)/(2.8-2.7) =.25.<n>The number of seconds will be larger, (1-4), (1-3) or (1-2)^(5).<n>Therefore, the milk and the cereal of a cow take a total of 54 seconds to get to the table. While it takes 42 seconds for cereal to get to the table, and the milk takes 48 seconds. The meat has a long time. The time it was in the container was. So the number of seconds and the number of seconds of each is 54 -.50 = 18 minutes.<n><n>Input:What happens to the water of a cow? Choices: A: it runs over to a reservoir B: it runs to another reservoir C: it flows over to a water bowl D: its water runs to the ground E: water runs to the sewer<n>Output:<n>In this experiment the cow's water was 1 hour old before it had any water at all.<n>The next day the water had completely dried up. (This is what happens in the world of water). The water could still flow from the reservoir to the bowl and the bowl may have had water, but it would never have any water to rinse the cow's feet. The water would sit in the reservoir and dry out if it wasn't filled

The second bird attempts to fly away but gets stuck on the first bird's back. The last bird cannot fly and tries to fly up until it gets stuck in the back of the first bird's beak, which causes him to crash into the ground. The bird that is too light to fly is not allowed to leave the zoo. He has to sit on the ground in a cage until another bird arrives that can carry him. How can he be taken back out?<n>Input: A bird lands on the same spot again and tries to fly away. He reaches the farthest point from the spot he has touched before but cannot take off any further because he is too heavy. This creates a conflict between the two birds causing one of them to try to fly away, but before he can fly off, the other bird catches him and he crashes back onto the ground. How can he be sent back out?<n>Input #2: A duck is lost in New York. The police look for the duck, but can't find him. What should they do next?<n>Output: The only way to send the duck back is for the police to get a rope big enough to carry him.

Once the structure is erected, if the peacock cannot fly, then he won't. I suppose he can jump the gap after that, but I don't think it would hurt him if he did.<n><n>Input #1: A bird enters the zoo.

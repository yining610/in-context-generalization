The teacher is asked to deliver this to five students. He starts off with the good examples first and then he moves through the bad ones.\n(1) In America, the teachers are not protected. The teachers do not have health insurance. Employees can be fired even for little reasons such as refusing to report to a school.\n(2) The teachers are not protected because unions do not form. Teachers, not union members, determine raises. The union does not pay tuition for employees that have babies.\n(3) The teachers are protected because they have union protections. Each teacher receives a salary increase. The increases are in addition to their salary, not their hourly wages.  Union protections make teachers more valuable to the school system because many people would rather support a teacher than to pay the teachers salary.\n(4) The teachers are not allowed to fire employees. Employees cannot be fired due to political reasons. The teachers are not protected from lawsuits, either. If an employee was fired because of a political protest, he has a right to appeal the decision to the school board, which can still fire in some cases.\n(5) The teachers are not entitled to overtime as well. Workers are entitled to their fair share of overtime pay.\n\ninput: a; b; c; d; f; g; h; i\nOutput: (4a, 4b, 5)\n\nInput:Mary wanted to donate money to her child\u2019s classroom teacher for Christmas.

The easiest problem is the one about an airplane that has three legs. This is easily solved. For the most part I found this board to be an interesting place to see what a person's take on certain problems was.\n\nIt's always fun to see the way a problem gets solved. I remember one the first week of school where students were required to do a work-study on a topic for a student survey. So we were asked to write a brief essay, along the lines of: \"The main problem I see with (student's topic), is the lack of (student's topic). To solve (student's topic), we must expand on it or modify it.\" The problem was to write the essay, in about two pages including a bibliography. In doing this, I couldn't help but think of another student's paper, at least from one of the classes I had taken, and how many of them would have been written in three or four pagers in that student's paper. I wondered if it would be okay to quote it for the blog, if the problem was worth mentioning?\n\nIn another class in college, my writing group got assigned to review the papers the professor had given us and grade them. One assignment that was due Friday was one of the papers I'd written. It was a paper on how the Civil Rights Movement was going to affect the future of race relations in our country, and I thought I did a good job analyzing it. I asked my group to grade it, and it turns out that a lot of the grade of my paper was in how much I was able to quote parts of the paper (and my own opinion, of course). There was an argument to be made (I think that was what the professor was asking us to argue) either way (whether I said these things in the paper or not) but they were certainly not critical parts of my opinion of the paper, so I didn't bother", "answer": "A: pub"}

{"text": "the same things that a person who commits a crime against a witness has already done\n\nAnswer: A.A perjury is one of the lowest forms of human offense. It is in effect a public act and is punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment. Also, a witness who lies to a criminal defendant, or in certain circumstances to other persons who are in a position of authority may be punished as an accomplice. It is also an impeachable offense. In all parts of the country perjury is punished by fine and imprisonment in a penal colony.\n\nB. A perjury is a type of crime of dishonesty in which one person (or the whole of a larger body) acts dishonestly in another person's presence, knowingly or unknowingly, for the purpose of causing another to testify falsely. The perjury of a person is a grave offense punishable by up to two or three years in prison.\n\nC. A perjury is a lie told to a criminal defendant, the witness as to the truth or truthfulness of another, or other appropriate authority, as an accomplice, or when the testimony would be incriminating to the defendant.\n\nD. A perjury is a false answer given in a deposition of a criminal defendant, a court deposition by a witness who is not required to be available to the defendant. A perjury is punishable by fines.\n\nE. A perjury is an intentional or reckless statement made while in the presence of someone authorized to answer or to conduct inquiry concerning a question. A perjury involves an affirmative action of knowingly making an erroneous statement that would impair the confidence in testimony given by a witness who normally would be required to answer. A perjury is punishable under some specific conditions, including perjury to protect the defendant or other privileged person.\n\nAnswer: D.A perjury is a serious offense. It is against the law to make an untruthful statement, and it is also punishable by the imposition of a fine. In order to get out of paying the fine, it must be proven beyond all doubt that a defendant had no knowledge that the truth had been falsified, by his being present for the actual or apparent act. It cannot be proven that the defendant had the capability to know whether the statement is false, or what he said when the statement was made, before he said it. This is the principle on which the whole felony perjury charge rests. If a defendant knowingly makes a false statement with intent to help incriminate other persons, he could be punished for manslaughter, at the very least, and", "answer": "B: arrest"}

After about 2 days, they\u2019ll be at the moon for 28.2 days. This equals 14 min a day per week for all the years they\u2019ve been on the moon.\nThe time a person spends at work equals 10 min. A day for every hour they spend at work equals 50 min. A day. The number of hours a person is home every day equals 14 hours.

If you want to know the percentage of water that falls as a waterfall on the water level and another way to know how much goes down the drain in a half-hour\u2019s worth of using the shower, the water level must be taken into account.

In 10 percent of cases, you\u2019ll lose less than half a glass per minute. In other cases, you\u2019re likely to lose three times that amount.

The time saved by saving can only reach $500. You would need to save $2500 to reach $5000 per annum. So, you need to save at\n$3000 per month to reach $5000 per month in three years. So, the minimum amount to\nreach$5000 per year is $8500 per year. So, the minimum required saving amount is $8000 per year, which would mean, the minimum required saving\namount is $84800 per year. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n2.

{"text": "1\n\nFeedback:\n1. The game was fun for my group. We got some good discussion going on the rules of the game and how to make more of them.\n2. The game made some discussion easy in math. I'd like a way to make rules for a longer game and/or in math classes in general.\n3. The game encouraged more discussion around reading comprehension and vocabulary building in English. I hadn't really had to think about vocabulary and how the story of Harry Potter was being told to a child when reading the books. I think it will be important for students to learn the vocabulary of what the characters in HP can say, because it will help them understand other books such as the Harry Potter books.\n4. I thought the game had some good communication skills. I had students try to make the rules while playing. I encouraged students to answer yes/no questions on the board rather than just going through the options until they understood. I also used a visual aid with the board to help kids understand the types of cards (monopoly, poker, etc).\n5. I thought the game required a lot of skills and thought management for the player making decisions, and strategy for playing the game. It also requires some communication skills from the players.\n\n**The game was great, however, the way it was structured made it difficult for the students. It would be great to have a longer game, maybe something that could fit into 2-3 rounds. I think that a good rule set could be adapted into an additional set of rules which would allow students to continue to play.**\n\n**This is one of the fun games that we played as a class last year.

There are many different words that have the same meaning but may have different definitions.  For example, the word tangible can describe a substance with a physical character or quantity.  Tangible can describe a quantity, form, etc.  Let\u2019s try to identify all the words that have the same definition but different meanings.  If we can identify all of the words that have the meaning \u201cmaterial\u201d, which has an actual physical substance with a physical character, then we will know that all the definitions of tangible are the same. If we can only identify the word \u201cmaterial\u201d with one definition then we will know that each definition describes an actual material substance in a particular physical form.\n\nSo we know the definition for the word tangible in the body of a verb, such as \u201cto be material\u201d. So we understand that materials are material objects, but that they are physical in a particular form.\n\nLet\u2019s identify the five different definitions of tangible given above.\n\nThe definition of tangible can be used as a noun meaning \u201ca material body that cannot be changed or destroyed\u201d.\n\nFor example, what do we know first?  Is material a noun or a verb?  We do not have any examples to give for material nouns, so we have to say the definition first.  It depends on whether or not you want to use the word \u201cmaterial body\u201d to describe tangible or to describe a physical object.  So what can we use as a noun for tangible?\nOutput: tangible.\n\nInput: the earth is round.

{"text": "10\n\nInput:  A: Mary's doctor is performing an MRI scan of her brain. MRI is short for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. MRI is also short forMagnetic Resonance Imaging. It is performed every day in medical imaging. MRI is usually an exam with X-ray pictures of the inside of the brain. MRIs show information about the brain that is difficult to see with other methods. It shows where neural connections are. It shows how brain cells work and how their connections change. MRI also shows how parts of the brain that people do not usually look at are active. MRI also shows how brain cells in other parts of the body work and how changes in brain cells can affect bodily functions. MRIs show how the brain works.  MRIs are common in the doctor's office to diagnose and treat mental illness including depression. MRI is used in hospitals too. MRIs take several minutes to do, because X-rays produce the same results in minutes, MRIs do not show information that would be difficult to see with just X-ray pictures. MRIs can show a lot about the body. The doctor's scan reveals information about: 1. which part of the brain is working. 2. the parts of the brain that are causing a person to feel upset or angry. 3. how much damage has been done to different parts of the body by an illness. 4. how healthy the brain is. 1. If a man wears a baseball hat with a large logo on it, an MRI may show activity in his brain. 2. If a woman has a large logo in her hair, she may also show activity in her brain. 3. MRIs show patterns of how brain cells are connected. MRIs show how people respond to certain brain cells. MRIs show more than just brain function. MRIs reveal how a person's body reacts to brain cells. MRIs can also show how a person thinks or works by revealing information about the thoughts, feelings or actions of different parts of the brain.  The brain can use many different parts to perform many physical and mental functions. MRIs show exactly how these parts of the brain work. The inside of a brain does not react like other parts of the body would. An MRI often shows how the skull that holds brain cells is shaped. An MRI also gives an exact view of how large the skull is. The brain can be large enough that it requires an MRI machine for imaging. MRIs are most useful to doctors and researchers but very useful to others too. Using", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

It was printed in paper with a surface area of 1.35 square miles, making it one of the largest books on paper to be published. It measures approximately 18 1/2\u201d x 23 7/8\u201d tall. Some critics have criticized the book due to poor writing, poor characterization, or just poor quality. Others have called it an important book and say that it has influenced countless people, many of them from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some have called it the \u201cgreatest book ever written.\u201d Some critics in the United States have criticized it for portraying an extremely negative view of poverty. It has received mixed reviews regarding the way that it portrays the English class system, the treatment of working class citizens, and depictions of many of the characters of A Christmas Carol. It has been criticized because some of some of the things that it touches on may make people think that today\u2019s society, or at least its treatment of the poor and working class, is worse. In addition, some have criticized it for the fact that the book is an allegory and an idealized view of the life of Dickens on account of the author\u2019s time living in an early Victorian era.\n\nOutput: 4,400,000 books were printed with the \u201cA Christmas Carol Christmas Edition.\u201d This edition contains a unique bonus, illustrated with black and white illustrations in the text. These illustrations are by the same author as those in the black and white original. The volume was printed in black and white to save costs and improve read", "answer": "A: few people"}

The second choice implies the person attempted to do it because of the second choice. The other choices are not as definitive but they do all have a strong possibility of being attempted.\n\nThe first choice is more likely to be successful. As an adult suicidal attempt is more frequent than it used to be. Most suicides occur in the first half of life after an initial attempt in middle or early childhood. The second choice is also more likely to be successful if it is in the first half of the life span. The first choice is also much less likely to succeed if the person had not attempted suicide previously. The other choice is much likelier than the first. A suicide attempt as a teenager is more likely to succeed if the teenager has attempted suicide before.

The answer to this is: \"2.\" The reason that 2 is the number of points one gets for choosing answer A is that in game theory, it is common to think that choosing the correct strategy is not as important a consideration as choosing the optimal strategy. That is, while choosing an optimal strategy is more important than choosing a correct strategy, not everyone has the knowledge necessary to be successful in the game. Because this is true, there are many situations where it is appropriate to go with the strategy that the other person has been playing. The correct strategy may change in real-time based on the information that one's opponent has.

While I understand that this assignment may have an impact on other people\u2019s reading comprehension and writing skills, it most likely should not be used as a teaching tool. The main reason that you and I cannot understand writing is that our brains are not wired to read. You will have to explain to me why you wrote something that the average 13-year-old child could understand if you think this information can be used as a teaching resource.\u201d The student replied, \u201cThis is a test, so I am supposed to write. And what I typed on the paper is true.\u201d The teacher responded, \u201cAs you stated, your assignment is to write. This assignment is used as a teaching tool because the majority of the people who read this assignment will have difficulty understanding your writing. So if you read the rest of the assignment, you\u2019ll notice that it\u2019s grammatically correct.\u201d The student continued, \u201cMy teacher doesn\u2019t care that you cannot understand my essay because when I explain myself to her, she will realize that I was telling her the truth. She will realize that I didn\u2019t write something to be tested. My teacher will know in her heart that my teacher is helping me understand my writing. That\u2019s how we are supposed to learn. And when I teach the class, I don\u2019t expect answers. I expect to be understood...at least partially. So when I don\u2019t understand a topic because I can\u2019t fully comprehend it, I can\u2019t criticize that teacher. That teacher isn\u2019t trying to get me to fail. She just wants to help me. She\u2019ll understand and she\u2019ll help me. I was wrong about that, but she won\u2019t find out.\u201d\nOutput: (B)\n\nInput:Mary\u2019s friend\u2019s parents ask her to babysit for them for", "answer": "B: fun"}

There are plenty of questions that are relevant to family finances and many answers that are relevant to kids! Here's an idea of another topic that you could play with the kids as well as you've mentioned.\n\nThis morning my daughter and I played some of my favorite games---however, instead of money, we got a lot more thinking about why others have money, why not, and how their actions actually affect their own lives.\n\nI just want to put in a little disclaimer about my teaching style. I'm not a math teacher by any means. I like to think of myself as a relationship person--you are my child. Of course math is awesome but the real key to teaching relationship is thinking like a parent, teacher, and student. And that might sound clich\u00e9, and it is. But once they are engaged and seeing where the person is, they are going to engage in a learning process and get it. That is something that kids never seem to learn until they start the learning process.

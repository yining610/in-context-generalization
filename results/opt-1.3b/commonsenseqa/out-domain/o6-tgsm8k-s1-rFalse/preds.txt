The easiest problem is the one about an airplane that has three legs. This is easily solved. For the most part I found this board to be an interesting place to see what a person's take on certain problems was.<n><n>It's always fun to see the way a problem gets solved. I remember one the first week of school where students were required to do a work-study on a topic for a student survey. So we were asked to write a brief essay, along the lines of: "The main problem I see with (student's topic), is the lack of (student's topic). To solve (student's topic), we must expand on it or modify it." The problem was to write the essay, in about two pages including a bibliography. In doing this, I couldn't help but think of another student's paper, at least from one of the classes I had taken, and how many of them would have been written in three or four pagers in that student's paper. I wondered if it would be okay to quote it for the blog, if the problem was worth mentioning?<n><n>In another class in college, my writing group got assigned to review the papers the professor had given us and grade them. One assignment that was due Friday was one of the papers I'd written. It was a paper on how the Civil Rights Movement was going to affect the future of race relations in our country, and I thought I did a good job analyzing it. I asked my group to grade it, and it turns out that a lot of the grade of my paper was in how much I was able to quote parts of the paper (and my own opinion, of course). There was an argument to be made (I think that was what the professor was asking us to argue) either way (whether I said these things in the paper or not) but they were certainly not critical parts of my opinion of the paper, so I didn't bother

Choices:  A: shame B: arrest C: embarrassment D: go to jail E: tension<n>Output:		 the same things that a person who commits a crime against a witness has already done<n><n>Answer: A.A perjury is one of the lowest forms of human offense. It is in effect a public act and is punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment. Also, a witness who lies to a criminal defendant, or in certain circumstances to other persons who are in a position of authority may be punished as an accomplice. It is also an impeachable offense. In all parts of the country perjury is punished by fine and imprisonment in a penal colony.<n><n>B. A perjury is a type of crime of dishonesty in which one person (or the whole of a larger body) acts dishonestly in another person's presence, knowingly or unknowingly, for the purpose of causing another to testify falsely. The perjury of a person is a grave offense punishable by up to two or three years in prison.<n><n>C. A perjury is a lie told to a criminal defendant, the witness as to the truth or truthfulness of another, or other appropriate authority, as an accomplice, or when the testimony would be incriminating to the defendant.<n><n>D. A perjury is a false answer given in a deposition of a criminal defendant, a court deposition by a witness who is not required to be available to the defendant. A perjury is punishable by fines.<n><n>E. A perjury is an intentional or reckless statement made while in the presence of someone authorized to answer or to conduct inquiry concerning a question. A perjury involves an affirmative action of knowingly making an erroneous statement that would impair the confidence in testimony given by a witness who normally would be required to answer. A perjury is punishable under some specific conditions, including perjury to protect the defendant or other privileged person.<n><n>Answer: D.A perjury is a serious offense. It is against the law to make an untruthful statement, and it is also punishable by the imposition of a fine. In order to get out of paying the fine, it must be proven beyond all doubt that a defendant had no knowledge that the truth had been falsified, by his being present for the actual or apparent act. It cannot be proven that the defendant had the capability to know whether the statement is false, or what he said when the statement was made, before he said it. This is the principle on which the whole felony perjury charge rests. If a defendant knowingly makes a false statement with intent to help incriminate other persons, he could be punished for manslaughter, at the very least, and

Mary tried to comfort Maggie over and over, but was interrupted by the nurse who was rushing into the room. Mary held on to her baby and sat her down in the operating room chair. She began to read a Bible story from it. Maggie told her, “Here grandma, let’s read this chapter.” She then began to read the last chapter as they waited for the doctor to come in there.

They then all hugged their baby tightly, but Mary said, “I need to get to mom.” She went back outside and met Maggie at the door with a worried look on her face. The nurse checked Maggie’s vitals, told her she was okay and left. Mary continued to read the story as they waited for the physician to get in. Then they all sat in silence for a moment in prayer once again before heading home.<n>Output: 1<n><n>Click Here to go straight to the chapter!http://www.godtube.com/videos/10-lessons-1<n><n>Click Here for more lessons!http://www.divine-tutorial.com/lesson-pages/lesson-11<n><n>Click Here to listen to the Chapter of Lesson 1http://www.godtub.com/audio/lesson-1<n><n>Click here to watch Lesson 2: Lesson 2: Love is a choice

For example, the speed of light is 186,792 mph, which means that time is running at a pace of about 186,792 miles per hour. This equals 7,914 miles per day. During the flight to the moon, NASA’s astronauts spend 10 minutes a day working on research, which equals to about 2 min. per person.<n>The speed of light is 186.792 mph. As they travel to the moon, these astronauts will spend 28.2 days there. This equals 14 min. a day for every year that the astronauts don’t make a complete round trip. After about 2 days, they’ll be at the moon for 28.2 days. This equals 14 min a day per week for all the years they’ve been on the moon.<n>The time a person spends at work equals 10 min.

Should I start on ground level?”  Max demonstrated on a tennis court where he picked three strokes and his girlfriend played the ball over the net. Over and over Max demonstrated what he knew, how much he meant to this girl, that he was going to be a real great tennis player. So, when her boyfriend came out of the pool, the girl was floored as to why Max had done this and asked him to teach her.  He did and they played all day.  They were so happy in each other’s company that they didn’t speak to anyone else. That night when they were lying in bed, the girl asked Max to have breakfast with her at the hotel which he easily agreed to do.  He ate several eggs and pieces of toast and sipped iced coffee. The girl was ecstatic when she saw him smiling and having a good time. Their day was filled with happiness.  Finally, a week later, her boyfriend came in and the girl said, “Well didn’t we have such a wonderful day?”  Max answered, “Yes, you did.”  Now, the girl was shocked! “I thought I was dating a guy!” she exclaimed.  As she was walking out of the room, Max was going out the door and she turned to him and said, “Didn’t you have such a terrific day with me too?”  She stood there with a blank look of surprise.  Max said, ”Yes, we did.”

The worker tries to find another pig to replace the one thrown away. On returning the bin, the worker notices the farmer's farmer is taking a long time to go to the factory each night and wonders what his problem is.

The worker then does the test on the farm and finds that the farmer has lost at least two of the pigs in the two years since the original pig was thrown away.  The worker then says that the farmer wants to find a couple of goats who would be okay living with the pigs and has put them up for adoption.

As they have problems finding a way to put the goats into new houses, they decide to get rid of the piglets too.

You think about it, but decide not to.<n>Why?<n>Solution:<n>You're going to be in charge of a country's public health system soon.

Now it is up to the rest of your class to keep the boy motivated so that he doesn't fall behind

If you want to know the percentage of water that falls as a waterfall on the water level and another way to know how much goes down the drain in a half-hour’s worth of using the shower, the water level must be taken into account. You take the water level, divide by four, and multiply by 1.33 to get the shower time. Now, consider how much water you actually need, and multiply by 1 to see how much water you actually lose in a half hour’s worth. How much does the shower take? In 10 percent of cases, you’ll lose less than half a glass per minute. In other cases, you’re likely to lose three times that amount. If you’re interested in knowing more about why using a shower timer isn’t the best way, try looking online for some articles by the water levels experts.<n>Output: 1/2<n><n>input: In this question, you would say that you’re making an important decision to work with a new friend.

We got some good discussion going on the rules of the game and how to make more of them.<n>2. The game made some discussion easy in math. I'd like a way to make rules for a longer game and/or in math classes in general.<n>3. The game encouraged more discussion around reading comprehension and vocabulary building in English. I hadn't really had to think about vocabulary and how the story of Harry Potter was being told to a child when reading the books. I think it will be important for students to learn the vocabulary of what the characters in HP can say, because it will help them understand other books such as the Harry Potter books.<n>4. I thought the game had some good communication skills. I had students try to make the rules while playing. I encouraged students to answer yes/no questions on the board rather than just going through the options until they understood. I also used a visual aid with the board to help kids understand the types of cards (monopoly, poker, etc).<n>5. I thought the game required a lot of skills and thought management for the player making decisions, and strategy for playing the game. It also requires some communication skills from the players.<n><n>**The game was great, however, the way it was structured made it difficult for the students. It would be great to have a longer game, maybe something that could fit into 2-3 rounds. I think that a good rule set could be adapted into an additional set of rules which would allow students to continue to play.**<n><n>**This is one of the fun games that we played as a class last year. Students have a couple of minutes to answer questions as they play. At the end of class, the students had to come up with 6 predictions about what Harry was going to find in a house that Ron shares with him. It was great for discussing how different things can be found when you don't know about something.**<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions: (1) Does Harry Potter know that Ron is sharing a house with a boy named Harry with a different name than Harry Potter? (2) What can Harry Potter expect next?<n>Output: 13<n><n>Input: The movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released on December 13, 2007.

The answers can be either correct or incorrect but the choice of what word comes next is the most important thing.<n><n>Input: What does the word “tangible” mean?<n>Output: It depends.  There are many different words that have the same meaning but may have different definitions.  For example, the word tangible can describe a substance with a physical character or quantity.  Tangible can describe a quantity, form, etc.  Let’s try to identify all the words that have the same definition but different meanings.  If we can identify all of the words that have the meaning “material”, which has an actual physical substance with a physical character, then we will know that all the definitions of tangible are the same. If we can only identify the word “material” with one definition then we will know that each definition describes an actual material substance in a particular physical form.<n><n>So we know the definition for the word tangible in the body of a verb, such as “to be material”. So we understand that materials are material objects, but that they are physical in a particular form.<n><n>Let’s identify the five different definitions of tangible given above.<n><n>The definition of tangible can be used as a noun meaning “a material body that cannot be changed or destroyed”.<n><n>For example, what do we know first?  Is material a noun or a verb?  We do not have any examples to give for material nouns, so we have to say the definition first.  It depends on whether or not you want to use the word “material body” to describe tangible or to describe a physical object.  So what can we use as a noun for tangible?<n>Output: tangible.<n><n>Input: the earth is round. What does the meaning of “round” usually indicate?<n>Output: the earth is flat<n><n>Submitted by G.S.<n>This is a great one. You don't have to do any thinking or work at all, it's just the

MRI is also short forMagnetic Resonance Imaging. It is performed every day in medical imaging. MRI is usually an exam with X-ray pictures of the inside of the brain. MRIs show information about the brain that is difficult to see with other methods. It shows where neural connections are. It shows how brain cells work and how their connections change. MRI also shows how parts of the brain that people do not usually look at are active. MRI also shows how brain cells in other parts of the body work and how changes in brain cells can affect bodily functions. MRIs show how the brain works.  MRIs are common in the doctor's office to diagnose and treat mental illness including depression. MRI is used in hospitals too. MRIs take several minutes to do, because X-rays produce the same results in minutes, MRIs do not show information that would be difficult to see with just X-ray pictures. MRIs can show a lot about the body. The doctor's scan reveals information about: 1. which part of the brain is working. 2. the parts of the brain that are causing a person to feel upset or angry. 3. how much damage has been done to different parts of the body by an illness. 4. how healthy the brain is. 1. If a man wears a baseball hat with a large logo on it, an MRI may show activity in his brain. 2. If a woman has a large logo in her hair, she may also show activity in her brain. 3. MRIs show patterns of how brain cells are connected. MRIs show how people respond to certain brain cells. MRIs show more than just brain function. MRIs reveal how a person's body reacts to brain cells. MRIs can also show how a person thinks or works by revealing information about the thoughts, feelings or actions of different parts of the brain.  The brain can use many different parts to perform many physical and mental functions. MRIs show exactly how these parts of the brain work. The inside of a brain does not react like other parts of the body would. An MRI often shows how the skull that holds brain cells is shaped. An MRI also gives an exact view of how large the skull is. The brain can be large enough that it requires an MRI machine for imaging. MRIs are most useful to doctors and researchers but very useful to others too. Using

During that time it was published in five volumes and a single issue. About 4,600,000 copies of the book have been printed to date. It has sold over a million copies, and it has been translated into 18 languages. It has been translated into 11 languages. It has sold over 20 million copies in its first decade of publication. The book is one of the most famous books in English and it has sold over 100 million copies. It has brought in over $50 billion dollars in foreign sales from all parts of the world. Approximately 1.3 million copies have been printed in a series of 11 small editions to be given out on Christmas Day. About 17,000,000 copies have been sold and the average cost of each edition is approximately four dollars. During the first 10 years print runs were limited to just a few thousand copies. It was printed in paper with a surface area of 1.35 square miles, making it one of the largest books on paper to be published. It measures approximately 18 1/2” x 23 7/8” tall. Some critics have criticized the book due to poor writing, poor characterization, or just poor quality. Others have called it an important book and say that it has influenced countless people, many of them from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some have called it the “greatest book ever written.” Some critics in the United States have criticized it for portraying an extremely negative view of poverty. It has received mixed reviews regarding the way that it portrays the English class system, the treatment of working class citizens, and depictions of many of the characters of A Christmas Carol. It has been criticized because some of some of the things that it touches on may make people think that today’s society, or at least its treatment of the poor and working class, is worse. In addition, some have criticized it for the fact that the book is an allegory and an idealized view of the life of Dickens on account of the author’s time living in an early Victorian era.<n><n>Output: 4,400,000 books were printed with the “A Christmas Carol Christmas Edition.” This edition contains a unique bonus, illustrated with black and white illustrations in the text. These illustrations are by the same author as those in the black and white original. The volume was printed in black and white to save costs and improve read

Choices:  A: scars B: being born C: sorrow D: misery E: kill yourself<n>Output:		 suicide<n><n>Comments:The first choice is a bold statement that gives a reason to believe the suicide attempt was intentional. The second choice implies the person attempted to do it because of the second choice. The other choices are not as definitive but they do all have a strong possibility of being attempted.<n><n>The first choice is more likely to be successful. As an adult suicidal attempt is more frequent than it used to be. Most suicides occur in the first half of life after an initial attempt in middle or early childhood. The second choice is also more likely to be successful if it is in the first half of the life span. The first choice is also much less likely to succeed if the person had not attempted suicide previously. The other choice is much likelier than the first. A suicide attempt as a teenager is more likely to succeed if the teenager has attempted suicide before. The second choice is far less likely to succeed if it is attempted immediately after the first attempt. The other choice is also much less probable if it resulted in death.

How do I tell him the temperature of the ingredients?  I don't have a thermometer. He wants this cupcake to taste like strawberry cheesecake. I decide that temperature is temperature and that I should use the measurements from a cupcake tin I have.  I have a measuring tape with me but I can't use it because my fingers are so numb from icing the cupcake. How do you tell him how to measure the ingredients?  How do you tell him what measurements are right and what aren't?  How do you explain the temperature of the ingredients to him?  I get to a total of 3.5 cupcakes.  I put a cupcake in the oven at 300 degrees for 1 minute.  It takes about 30 seconds for the cupcakes to cool.  What does his teacher say?  "I bet the first 1/2 cup of the cupcake was cooked before you put it in the oven.  He was lucky that he didn't burn the rest of the cupcake."  This might happen because you have no way of telling whether the heat of the cupcake is sufficient to cook all the ingredients or whether it is necessary.  What would you have done differently?  Why?  What could you learn from this experience?

This feature is for the owner to use while on the phone.  They want to put some stickers on the windshield that they will have the owner put on when the car is parked. The owner wants to show the salesman how the customer might use this feature.  The salesman tells the owner that he can do that but would require a $20 per sticker charge plus a $10 per sticker charge for the company as well.  If they don't pay both the company and the seller at least $45 each, they will be out $60.  The owner suggests that they pay the company and the company $45 each while they put the stickers on to see how many customers they can attract by putting this feature on.  The salesman agrees, but asks for $50 as a fee because he believes that the company will help him attract the customers.  The owner says he can do that for them but he wants the money up front.  The salesman then says, "Here's your fee right here."  The owner says, "What about your fee?" The salesman says "What, what, what!"

Instead of telling him, the boy told him "because you asked."  Then the boy stood back up, put his head under the water, and began to swim laps again.  The boy got wet again and then told his friend, this time asking him if he started.  The friend then told him he started, thinking that this question would help him get the water out of his ear.  The boy was a little angry, but decided to tell his friend in case it was a dumb question. So he told his friend he started, and that he could only ask him the question again if he decided not to start.  When he asked why he was angry about being asked, the boy apologized and told his friend, "Because it felt stupid."<n>Output: The boy decided to tell his friend all this time so he would not have to stop again.

The teacher decided to read the book aloud so that the whole school could hear the story. What the students wanted was to be able to choose which part of the story they wanted to hear. The students wanted a chance to choose the first three words of the story and a chance to choose the second three words and last three words. In the book, there are five stories. Each story is called "The Beginning of the End" which tells a different part of how Penn started his life and his work to set up the colony of Philadelphia. The teacher told the students that they could choose which "The Beginning of the end" section they wanted to hear. Each class had a group of five, they had to choose one section of the story. When they chose the first three words they were in class. They had a chance to choose the words before the teacher finished reading The Beginning of the End. If they got the words wrong the teacher would say their first name and give them points for spelling. If they got the correct ones, they would get to choose the next three words. The teacher called the first two students, Sam and Mike. The students didn't know from where they got the three words but they got them right none the less. They went out to an empty room with three seats. Sam and Mike sat in the middle and the teacher called the third student, Paul for his turn. The students took their chairs, Sam to the left and Mike to the right. It took two minutes to read the story.

After this Sam spoke for two minutes, he chose the first three words of "He is our Father, the King of Kings" and Mike spoke for three minutes, he chose the second three words of "He has been, he is now and he never shall be". Paul ended his talk by choosing the end of the story "When He is asked, 'What is the greatest commandment' He will give them this, 'thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind'. Paul, Mike and Sam chose to read their "The Beginning of the ending"

This is called a “rejection.” A girl has “unrequited affection.” The girl is not “desperate.” She is not “bored.”  The rejection of a girl will usually elicit an apology and a promise to do better.  “Desperation” occurs when a girl feels so “hungry” and “disappointed” over something—for example, a failed boyfriend or a failed date—that she feels the need for an alternative. “Boredom” is the third state of “despair” where a girl feels so ”distressed” and “depressed” that she needs more attention and excitement.  A girl who is bored will try to “spark” excitement and excitement through “behavioral changes.” A girl who is unhappy or depressed may “turn on the television” or “spend more time” doing something other than her social or extracurricular activities.  “Impulsivity” occurs when a boy is too excited and cannot resist having sex with a girl.  Impulsivity can be so intense that the boy may be “dangerous” and risk his own or his lover’s safety.  It can happen so fast that the boy “has no time for a phone number or time to get to the grocery store. ” A “boredom” can affect a boy during a sex “rush.” A boy “cannot control himself” when aroused. This type of excitement may involve “stimulation” of the body, such as a boy’s fingers or toes, or “masturbation.”  A boy with “unrequited love” will often use “sexuality” as a way he can please his girlfriend and “get a reaction from her.”  An “unrequited” is “when he cannot fulfill what he has a sexual or romantic interest in.”  The term “despair’ is often also described in the third person, “I can’t keep him away.”  The

The reason that 2 is the number of points one gets for choosing answer A is that in game theory, it is common to think that choosing the correct strategy is not as important a consideration as choosing the optimal strategy.

Because this is true, there are many situations where it is appropriate to go with the strategy that the other person has been playing. The correct strategy may change in real-time based on the information that one's opponent has. In game theory, this means that many situations can be reduced to three "picks."<n>Input: Aries must choose between two options.

While I understand that this assignment may have an impact on other people’s reading comprehension and writing skills, it most likely should not be used as a teaching tool. The main reason that you and I cannot understand writing is that our brains are not wired to read. You will have to explain to me why you wrote something that the average 13-year-old child could understand if you think this information can be used as a teaching resource.” The student replied, “This is a test, so I am supposed to write. And what I typed on the paper is true.” The teacher responded, “As you stated, your assignment is to write. This assignment is used as a teaching tool because the majority of the people who read this assignment will have difficulty understanding your writing. So if you read the rest of the assignment, you’ll notice that it’s grammatically correct.” The student continued, “My teacher doesn’t care that you cannot understand my essay because when I explain myself to her, she will realize that I was telling her the truth. She will realize that I didn’t write something to be tested. My teacher will know in her heart that my teacher is helping me understand my writing. That’s how we are supposed to learn. And when I teach the class, I don’t expect answers. I expect to be understood...at least partially. So when I don’t understand a topic because I can’t fully comprehend it, I can’t criticize that teacher. That teacher isn’t trying to get me to fail. She just wants to help me. She’ll understand and she’ll help me. I was wrong about that, but she won’t find out.”<n>Output: (B)<n><n>Input:Mary’s friend’s parents ask her to babysit for them for

The goal of the question is to draw a spectrum that includes a wide range of answers. This is not an essay test. It will work well if the child tells you what happens during each scenario to increase his feeling of responsibility and to make him remember that there are different options. The answers to each scenario should include the following information:<n>The type of activity (walking, moving your legs, changing your shoes, smelling smoke, etc.) – the type of activity is significant; there should be some negative feelings associated with this activity, like a boredom.<n>The emotions that happen during certain circumstances – how difficult, exciting, or fun is it? For example, if your child is walking through a store and he sees a chocolate bar, how excited would he be then? The emotion should indicate the degree to which your child feels a responsibility for the circumstances. For example, if you teach your child that he should be careful when crossing the street, you may feel that this emotion represents a sense of responsibility.<n>The number of activities that the child tries to complete – the number of activities the child completes indicates his sense of importance in life.<n>Here is an example of a question from a previous test:<n>What are the 4 types of situations that students must feel responsible for?

Because 1 sticker is a sticker, one sticker is all the stickers Mary has available on a page.  If you subtract 1 sticker, then Mary's remaining sticker portfolio is 9.  2 stickers are enough to fill up the page, so we can say:<n>Input: 9 - 1 = 8<n>Output: 44<n>Input: Zach is earning $10 in weekly allowance.  After taxes his family will owe $17.65.  He will subtract $7 per hour from $10 to get a value of how many hours Zach will babysit for this season.  This will give us:<n>Output:<n>Output: 44 - (7:10PM x 7) = 22 x 22 = 37 hours x 9 = 33 hours x 33 hours x 30 hours = 6.66 hours x 15 per hour x 15 = 60 hours.6 x 60 = 4.88 hours x 10 per hour x 3 = 48 hours.<n>Output: 27<n>Output: George owes $20 to his bowling team.  The money will be deducted from his $12 per week allowance.  He subtracts this amount from the $10 per week to get a total of $5.40 which will be divided between the bowling account and the family saving account to get the balance of his allowance at the beginning of the year.  This will give him:<n>Output: 8<n>Output: Josh's mom will give him $20 to buy a hat and $25 to buy a pencil.  These two purchases add up to $10.35 which will be divided between a savings account and his parents’ grocery account.  This will give Josh an average of $1.50 per week.<n>Output: 9<n>Output: Max will save $3 per week in his allowance.  If he saves an extra $3 each week than it will be $15.60 a month which will give him $80 in 2.5 months at the end of the year.  These are the times that Max uses his allowance to purchase items:  12:00 Noon - 2:00 PM 2:00 PM - 8:00 PM 8:00 PM - 2:00 AM 2:00 AM - 8:00 AM 8:00 PM - midnight<n>Output: 16 hours x 9 + 8 = 72 hours 30 minutes x 4 +

Math, science and foreign language. How many subjects does she have for next quarter? Questions 1-5: The students have been assigned topics in which they take a paper to their teacher and have to come up with ideas for three different sentences with the same words to use. What is a sentence? The student has only 15 minutes to come up with a sentence, choose 3 that you like and use in class today. The student is allowed to change this sentence up each time they do this. If they choose to go with the same sentence, what did I say when I gave them the prompt? Questions 1-5 should now be about different types of sentences.<n>Questions 1-5 should now just be to write different ways of writing sentences.<n>Questions 1 - 5 should now just be how to use sentences, not about sentences.<n>Things have got a little weird since I've added all these questions.<n>I think I'm about done here.<n>If anyone else wants to add questions to the prompt, tell me when they post, and I'll add them up here.<n><n>__________________<n>If a man's best friend looks like a woman, then he is a bisexual. - Jack Handy<n><n>The original intention of this contest was to stimulate the thinking in the students about the concept of an article (this was their first experience outside of our classroom environment with an article). This idea has been widely re-interpreted to be more of an article than intended, as well as the students have taken great advantage of it. This prompts me to wonder why the students were given specific topics, instead of just a prompt/theoretical question to think about and choose from.<n>Students have found many unique ways to answer the "How Much? - Are you sure?" question about savings. But the prompt/theoretical questions seemed to be very limited, and I am wondering:<n>Was the prompt/theoretic question intended to provide some structure to the class discussion that could lead us down different paths while having a discussion (i.e. the students are given directions on solving the problem, but their decisions are to be on a free-for-all basis)?<n>Or, was the prompt/theoretically answer intended to "encourage students to think about their own money/life situation," (i.e. to start a discussion about "your" money situation)?<n>I personally think the former idea is more common sense in any classroom

It made it harder for me to concentrate on my notes.  Now I tried my best to listen carefully to Matt.  He was going much slower this week, but at least I was still on schedule.  There was no more time, especially after my test on Tuesday.  I thought this was my best chance to get a full semester's work in.  Matt finished writing the answers and handed them back to me.<n>I handed back my answer sheets and headed back to my bookbag.  I put the books in their cases and headed for my car.

I asked.<n>"We are on time," she replied.<n>“So what?”  I shouted.<n>"We could have missed, didn't you watch the weather report?" she asked.<n>I ignored her and went back to my bookbag to retrieve my other notebooks.  I opened the one for algebra and flipped through it.

He has always been a right handed person and always has been a left handed pitcher in baseball. If he throws a pitch and it is hit, it will go over the outfielder's head and foul off into the outfield, right? Now he has the same pitcher motion (left hand). If he throws two of them and one of them hits into the left field foul pole, the first is a right handed pitch which will foul off the outfielder's head, making the foul ball foul. If the second is a left handed pitch, it will go over a fielder's head, making the ball hit into the outfield. If the first one is hitting into a pitcher motion and the ball hits the batter's helmet, he will be thrown out on the error. If he throws two balls directly into the face and one hits into the catcher's helmet, he is thrown out. If a ball hits into the pitcher motion and the batter hits into the batter's catcher's helmet then the pitcher's pitch will land in the batter's helmet, making the ball hit the batter's helmet, the batter will be thrown out on this error. What would be the correct throwing motion for the batter?<n>Output: 13<n><n>Input: A girl named Rebecca had an unusual last name she wanted to change.

The patients are all on pain medication but some dogs respond to pain drugs with different amounts and intensities. The veterinarian can only fit four of the dogs into the exam room, so a few dog owners wait out of view in a separate room. The veterinarian examines the most severely depressed dog first. He tells the dog to lie down on the exam table. A needle goes in the dog's upper back and into a hole in his skin. Then the dog is tied to the table.

When the girl said yes, the pig's owner took off to get the groom. However, when he got home, the groom was gone. A week later, the pig's owner saw that the girl was not in her dress and he was not wearing his ring. When the pig came back and asked about his missing wife, the pig's owner found out that she was dead. To get his marriage back on track after losing his wife, the pig's new wife tried to look beautiful. The pig's wife became very pale and even fainted after looking at herself in the mirror. But the pig's new wife soon recovered. The pig went to his old wife. The old pig said that her husband had left without taking the bride. The new pig replied, "You are the bride. I will never forgive him." To find a wedding ring, the pig’s wife went to the cemetery to get herself dressed. But when she got there, the cemetery was empty.

If you multiply 2 and divide by 9, you’ve lost a third, so you multiply -2 and divide by 9 to get 4, which is the right answer. If you multiply -2 and -9 by each other to get -28, you get -28, so you divide by 9 and get 28, which is the right way to multiply and divide. The only time you actually add and divide is when you divide by 9 and then multiply the original number twice to get an equal number. The answer is still 2, however, because you can’t multiply 2 by 2 and then divide by 9 without doubling yourself.

I appreciate your interest in this game--I really think it's something that everyone in the family can play. There are plenty of questions that are relevant to family finances and many answers that are relevant to kids! Here's an idea of another topic that you could play with the kids as well as you've mentioned.<n><n>This morning my daughter and I played some of my favorite games---however, instead of money, we got a lot more thinking about why others have money, why not, and how their actions actually affect their own lives.<n><n>I just want to put in a little disclaimer about my teaching style. I'm not a math teacher by any means. I like to think of myself as a relationship person--you are my child. Of course math is awesome but the real key to teaching relationship is thinking like a parent, teacher, and student. And that might sound cliché, and it is. But once they are engaged and seeing where the person is, they are going to engage in a learning process and get it. That is something that kids never seem to learn until they start the learning process. And that's true of any situation: in an activity, at church, etc.<n><n>Please visit my website at www.theteacherhouse.com to read more about me and my work.

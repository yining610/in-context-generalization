You can put together short questions that include key points in order to see if you are making good sense.\n\nFor example -- if you are going to give an answer like \"the number of goals scored in each game\", then you need to say what the frequency of that is. In other words, how many games does it take for them to score that many goals? Is each one in every game? In a quarter of games? In each game? Is each goal at the same time during the same game?\n\nIf you don't know, then guess.\n\nIf you want to improve your writing, start by using the words \"in your opinion\" before anything you write.

It will help with making it more legible.\n\nIf you get stuck at parts of your problem solving, practice it with short questions like \"this is what I think would happen, and I think I have found the answer\" or \"it seems that this might be the answer, what do you think?\".\n\nOnce you feel more comfortable, you can start trying out longer questions. Maybe something like \"how many goals a player scores in a particular season?\" \"How far can a player fall down a staircase?\" \"How many shots are taken, per team, in each game?\" (You could do this in groups of 10 and each team shoot 10 shots each time.)\n\nI hope that is enough information for you, good luck!\n\nIf this were a normal problem that I didn't have to fix (and I can see that it isn't, as I've never had this problem before) it might help if you made the questions", "answer": "C: american city"}

Each person gets 435 people to vote for them (or 435 people per representative) and 5 people per House to determine their votes.

{"text": "D\n\n### Response: C\n\nThe word \"plural\" can be used if you want to show \"a number of.\" In this case, it will be \"the number of goods sold (in a period) in this retail outlet (for a period of time). As such, the total amount of goods sold this period (in this retail outlet) is XX.\"\n\n### Correction: \"The word's\" and \"its\" are both considered plurals but have different meanings. Answering \"it\" is correct. If you are a native English speaker, it is sometimes used as a pronoun. For example, \"I got an extra paycheck in the mail today\"; \"She and I\" are not in our dictionary.\n\n### Correct Answer: The question asked who bought the \"best\" nut. In fact, both men bought the best nut. The nuts are purchased by men but the nut is used by both men before it is split by another man.\n### Answer: C\n\n### Correct Answer (for two men) :\n\"C\"\n\n### Response: You can also ask a question to the first statement using the first statement as the response. For example, \"If these men are the same man, then whom is buying the best nut?\"\n\n### Answer: \"A\"\n\n### Correction: In most languages, this question is only grammatically correct if there is a verb in the preposition. The verb phrase \"to be\" and \"to have\" are grammatically correct. For example, \"he walked with the dog\". If there are multiple verbs in the clause, only the last verb in the clause needs to be specified. So, \"his\" is not grammatically correct.\n\nYou may also type in any questions about gender or gender norms/proportion or to show that the answer is plural, as in \"What was the biggest purchase of the three?\" or \"the biggest purchase by the two men was?\"\n\nThis way, you can show that the answer is non-plural. Then, you will see if it is correct. You could also write the gender, or more than one gender, in case it is different.\n\nPlease note that if you used plural pronouns, those may not show up if you are working with a word length limit, or if you have entered another word to display the information in the page.\n\n### Question #3\n\nInput: Each day three women spend about an hour working in", "answer": "B: big house"}

However, he does not have to do anything more if he decides not to apply the accelerator pedal. If, however, he does not want to drive at all, why not press the brake pedal instead? (The answer should be: because it is easier.)\nOutput: A: accelerating C: brake D: manual E: plane\n\nOutput: The player must press down the accelerator pedal to move forward and then press down the brake pedal to stop the car. However, when the player stops the car using his hands, he cannot go any farther and must hold the brake pedal. If the car travels faster than the speed controller programmed for it, it will continue to accelerate even though it does not have a physical accelerator. If the car is going too slowly, the player must press the accelerator pedal. The solution is: press down the accelerator pedal without turning the wheel, as long as the car moves without using its brake pedal.\nOutput: A accelerating C: brake D : manual E: plane\nThe answer: A\n\nInput: John went on a vacation with four friends to a faraway Island.

Divide these numbers by the number of weeks to find the food needs of the people per week. Multiply by 10 to get the average weekly demand and then multiply by 20 to work out the food supply. Multiply by 500 since it should be assumed that the price of food will go up each year during the next 100 years. Divide each amount by the number of people working and add it to the food supply to give the expected food demand over the next 100 years. The percentage required to feed those people for the years of production is multiplied by 70. If the number of people requiring more than the food supply each year is less than the amount needed, divide the excess money from the excess of the production by 30, and then divide the excess money by the number of people. This figure should give you a good idea of the amount of surplus food you can afford to buy at once. If the excess of food is more than the surplus, multiply everything by 75 to get a realistic estimate that you'll buy. Multiply the average production by 70 to get the projected average food supply over the next 100 years or so. Divide this number by the total number of people the population is expected to grow through 2050 so that the estimated food supply can be broken down per year.

What is the third of the terms of the inequality (i.e. the first number in the formula) and its first number?\nOutput: The value is -1, so we conclude that the third is 0.  Therefore both terms become even.  But we do not know which of the two first terms represents the odd portion of 0 and what fraction represents the even portion.  So let's divide it by 10, so we can get the identity:  3x10 -1 = 0.  Now the second formula must be true too.  So if we divide both terms by 10, we get the identity: 0.  Therefore the value of 1 is equal to 0, so we can conclude the third is also equal to 0.  Therefore the fourth term must also be equal to 0.  That is what we conclude from the first term.  Therefore the second term must be equal to the third term.  So if we subtract both first and third terms from 0, we get 1.  And if we divided 8 by 0, we get 1, so we conclude that 2 is the integer form of 0.  That is the identity:  2x10 -1 / 10 = 0 or 0.  So the first term must equal 0, the second term must be 1, and the third term must be 0.  So 2 \u00d7 10 = 0.  Now divide the third term by 28 = 0, the second term by 0 = 0, and 1 = or 0, so we get 1.  That's 1! Or 1.  The identity:  1 / 0 = 0", "answer": "E: new"}

How many minutes/hours would you estimate it takes to learn to cross-check figures? Example. Let us assume you know how many minutes 60 minutes would be for a person to cross the US border. Would you divide 60 minutes by 6 for a number of figures to get a rough estimate or would you multiply the figures together in order to find the answer?\nExample:\nIf the person knew it took 6 minutes to cross the border, he would subtract 60 minutes from 12 to get a figure of 120 minutes. Divide 120 minutes by 12 to get the number of minutes 60 minutes in each hour that it takes a person to cross.\nExample:\nIf we divided 120 minutes/hour by 60, to get an average figure of 24 minutes, we can deduct 60 hours from 24 to get 240 hours. Divide 240 hours/hour by 60 to get the number of hours 60 minutes in each hour.\nExample:\nThe total is 720 (24+240) + 420 (60+30) = 840.\n\nInput: Each of these 5 games takes 50 minutes to complete the first round.

He used to see her at his daughter's swimming lessons, but didn't mention to her that he wanted to buy her a car. Instead, he kept seeing her at the pool and wanted to know how old she was. Finally she called him to tell him about the car he was thinking of buying for her. David knew that his daughter was going to be happy because she was sure that he would buy her the car she wanted. David wanted to give his daughter the car she wanted the most, so he asked her parents to think up an interesting gift for her.

David told them that this was the first time that he had ever asked anyone for help and so he wasn't sure what to get them. Her parents helped him by picking out the gift, but David still wanted to give his daughter an easy gift. They then suggested that he buy her something that only a small group could appreciate.

You must factor cost of the movie and volume into everything you do including what you can and can't do to get the numbers in.  For instance, if you can't have more than 5 people in the theater, but you want a 20 minute movie, then you can't really factor in cost.  You also have to factor inflation into everything, and you can't let volume get in the way or add cost to something you have to do.  You have two choices:  First, you can do an average movie, but then there is no room for your own opinions.  Or, you can use real-life examples.  How about if you calculate the cost and volume of the ticket based on both the cost and volume of other types of movie tickets.

The doctor says she has a finger fracture and that she needs to get a tetanus shot.  This is an emergency so they bring her to the emergency room. She needs a tetanus shot now.

The doctor says that he would like to give the girl a sedative; however, another doctor (not in the room) disagrees so the doctor takes the girl back to the private room where she is able to get some sleep before she gets back to work.  After she gets back to work she continues to use her fingers for years.  One day she falls and breaks a finger.  When she sees this she is upset so she goes to the emergency room.

{"text": "1\n\nIn this lesson you will calculate the number of days in a school year you can attend a secular party and how much money goes to help your parents with it. In order to do this, I divided the total number of days you can attend into two equal parts. Here is your answer:\n\nYou are a Christian. You have three days a week off school and three Saturdays in a school year. Over the course of 365 days, you attend a secular party 3 times a year. During one secular party (let\u2019s say for example you are 18 years old) you have enough time to attend 13 secular parties but only spend 4 days at a secular party. For another example, you are 36 years old. After you finish attending a secular party, you have 30 hours to finish a school year. During that 30 hours you do not attend a secular party. During the 36 years you have been in school, you have attended 3 secular parties. The total hours you have spent attending secular parties are 300. You receive $600 in annual income. On a yearly basis, this comes to:\n\n$150 x 3 days = $600\n\nSo, what is the amount of money your parents earn from secular parties? This may change over a life time.

They can then make it seem like the word \"the\" and the word \"a,\" are synonymous. Students can use the word \"a\" in place of the word \"the\" a few times but mostly write in \"the\" because they do not fully understand what is being referred to in that location. Students are not making their own choices when they use the word \"a.\"\n\nStudents in class are very interested in what we use the word \"a,\" for. Sometimes they are able to use the word \"a,' in place of \"the,\" a couple of times, but then they quickly make the mental connection that the word \"a,\" is the only thing that refers to a place that exists in the world.\n\nThis word \"a,\" is used frequently in the same area. Students learn that the word \"a,' is a synonym and they understand that the word \"the,\" is synonymous to the word \"a, a,\" and that the word \"a.,\" and the word \"the,\" refer to the same physical object. In the example above, the word \"a,\" and the word, \"the,\" are synonymous in describing a place that exists in a language but we are not going to have to reread the lesson because the students should re-read the definition of the word, \"a,\" in order to learn what the word means.

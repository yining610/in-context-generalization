He felt overheated and so he opened the hood to cool himself down. While he was doing this, he saw a rat run across the road. He tried to catch the runnier rat but was soon distracted by another rat running across the road. When he got to the other end of the road, he decided to chase down the rat who was running in the opposite direction. As soon as he caught up to the rat, the rat began to run away again. Once the rat disappeared out of sight, he looked around to see if the dog he was riding with had caught the second rat. He immediately pulled over onto the side of the road and the dog followed him. When he reached his destination on the road, he decided he had better hurry along and catch the second rat that was in sight. He made it a few seconds ahead of the rat when he saw the dog catch the rat and put him in a crate. The boy then climbed into the crate and the dog drove the next few blocks before he was able to catch up.

The two halves that make up the metal bar are called the top and bottom. The bottom side is thinner than the top side. The thicknesses of the top and bottom make the bar have a curved bottom edge. At first, the bar does not have a bottom edge because it is not curved. However, it gets curved later on when the upper curve of the bar is bent. The bottom edge of the bar is so curved that there is an inch or so of empty space in front of the upper two-thirds of the bar. The bar then has an inverted V. The inverted V creates space in front of the middle-third portion after it is bent. The two halves that made the bar are called the top edge and bottom edge.<n>Output: 1,902.14<n><n>Input:Jim has 2 cars.

He decides to ask his son the way home, since he is more experienced in swimming. The son leads the man along for a short distance to a small body of water where the son can get a few feet away from the shoreline. The father asks his son to swim back, and the boy agrees. The father goes in the water in front of him and instructs his son to go straight. The boy swam straight, as he expected, but the father went deeper into the water and disappeared. The son is scared and cries out for help. The boy turns to look for his father and finds a stranger swimming with him, just as his father had been doing. The stranger asks the boy if he needs help. The boy cries out, but stops when he sees that the stranger has gone back under water. The stranger, thinking he has lost his father, swims back to the shore and cries out for help for his father. The stranger then pulls out his cell phone and calls an emergency service. The service operator picks up the son, who was shocked to see his father's face. The operator gives the boy a list of directions to a nearby fishing boat. The boy swam toward the boat, with his father still under water. He can only hear the whistle as his father's body is pulled away from the boat. The boy continues swimming until he arrives at another boat, where he can speak with his father's family.

You can put together short questions that include key points in order to see if you are making good sense.<n><n>For example -- if you are going to give an answer like "the number of goals scored in each game", then you need to say what the frequency of that is. In other words, how many games does it take for them to score that many goals? Is each one in every game? In a quarter of games? In each game? Is each goal at the same time during the same game?<n><n>If you don't know, then guess.<n><n>If you want to improve your writing, start by using the words "in your opinion" before anything you write. And make sure you use "in your opinion" not "this is my opinion". Then, if you want, try and use a "sneak peak" to let the reader know there is a part of your opinion in there. It will help with making it more legible.<n><n>If you get stuck at parts of your problem solving, practice it with short questions like "this is what I think would happen, and I think I have found the answer" or "it seems that this might be the answer, what do you think?".<n><n>Once you feel more comfortable, you can start trying out longer questions. Maybe something like "how many goals a player scores in a particular season?" "How far can a player fall down a staircase?" "How many shots are taken, per team, in each game?" (You could do this in groups of 10 and each team shoot 10 shots each time.)<n><n>I hope that is enough information for you, good luck!<n><n>If this were a normal problem that I didn't have to fix (and I can see that it isn't, as I've never had this problem before) it might help if you made the questions

Each person gets 435 people to vote for them (or 435 people per representative) and 5 people per House to determine their votes.

The total mortgage is $36,000.  The total interest costs are $20,200.  If you purchase $100,000 of home insurance, the cost per year is $5,000.  If you purchase the same amount of home insurance but pay $100 a month, the monthly cost is $200.  If you choose to pay the insurance premium every month for 5 months, the cost per month is $500.  If you purchase a loan that lasts 20 years at 6% plus 3% interest and pays off the loan every 20 years, the monthly cost per month is $1,750.  If you purchase your insurance premium and have your mortgage payment paid off in 20 years, the monthly payment would be $1,200.  If your mortgage is paid off in 8 years, it is paid off the same way (minus the insurance premium every month).

They are on opposite sides of the street. A friend from law school asked him if he had the time to meet her. He said it would be nice but not necessary. She said it wouldn't hurt to ask. He did and he was glad he did. She was quite shocked when he said he needed to go to the Supreme Court. She was very excitedly asking him how he was going to be able to go. Tom responded that he had reserved an office for her before she asked and he reserved it right after he met her. She told him if he could do that she would come over and help him. He was a bit taken back by this and thought to himself how strange this sounds. He wasn’t expecting this kind of friendship at all and he had never had a friend do things for him in the past that way. She said she thought he had an interesting idea but wasn’t quite sure she could ask him to do it. Tom asked if she was sure. She said she wasn’t but she thought he should get going and get started now. He went to his office to write up a contract and get an estimate before telling her what he was going to do. He spent all day in his office writing and re-writing, getting estimates, and finally getting a contract written and signed to get permission and approval and the approval of the parties involved. He wrote a few other things down and then went to meet her. The two of them sat in his office and talked for a bit before getting in the elevator to go back down to his office. The friend from law school asked Tom if his idea was going to work. Tom said he thought so and he looked forward to working with her.<n>Output: 14; E)<n><n>Feedback:<n><n>You Are Writing: This is a real life story about one of the employees at your work place.

Choices:  A: europe B: big house C: tuxedo D: palace E: men's room<n>Output:		 D<n><n>### Response: C<n><n>The word "plural" can be used if you want to show "a number of." In this case, it will be "the number of goods sold (in a period) in this retail outlet (for a period of time). As such, the total amount of goods sold this period (in this retail outlet) is XX."<n><n>### Correction: "The word's" and "its" are both considered plurals but have different meanings. Answering "it" is correct. If you are a native English speaker, it is sometimes used as a pronoun. For example, "I got an extra paycheck in the mail today"; "She and I" are not in our dictionary.<n><n>### Correct Answer: The question asked who bought the "best" nut. In fact, both men bought the best nut. The nuts are purchased by men but the nut is used by both men before it is split by another man.<n>### Answer: C<n><n>### Correct Answer (for two men) :<n>"C"<n><n>### Response: You can also ask a question to the first statement using the first statement as the response. For example, "If these men are the same man, then whom is buying the best nut?"<n><n>### Answer: "A"<n><n>### Correction: In most languages, this question is only grammatically correct if there is a verb in the preposition. The verb phrase "to be" and "to have" are grammatically correct. For example, "he walked with the dog". If there are multiple verbs in the clause, only the last verb in the clause needs to be specified. So, "his" is not grammatically correct.<n><n>You may also type in any questions about gender or gender norms/proportion or to show that the answer is plural, as in "What was the biggest purchase of the three?" or "the biggest purchase by the two men was?"<n><n>This way, you can show that the answer is non-plural. Then, you will see if it is correct. You could also write the gender, or more than one gender, in case it is different.<n><n>Please note that if you used plural pronouns, those may not show up if you are working with a word length limit, or if you have entered another word to display the information in the page.<n><n>### Question #3<n><n>Input: Each day three women spend about an hour working in

I've made some minor adjustments as to simplify things.<n>Input: A box is a 5' by 5' box. The 5' part is just part of the box and is a fractional size; it is 0.3% of the distance from side A to side B. Side A has 4 sides, and side B is the 6th side, so a total of 6 sides. The length of side A: 5' = 0.300<n>Input: a loaf is 1.3 lbs with an empty weight of 2. The 5 lb loaves of bread have an empty weight of 1 lb. It should be noted that with an empty weight of 1, and a weight of 2 pounds for the loaf, the total weight of 5+1+2 = 4. If we take the numbers directly off the box, the calculation is correct. However, we will make a few changes to the numbers to simplify things a bit. Let's consider the bread recipe. Take the ingredients as follows:<n><n>Bread<n><n>Ingredients<n><n>1 lb.<n><n>2 lbs.<n><n>2<n><n>1<n><n>2<n><n>2<n><n>3<n><n>So our final number is $23. That's actually quite a bit under a loaf, but we'll take those gains. There are a few other things we can simplify a bit easier too that will make our numbers much better.<n>Input: A loaf is 7 lbs with an empty weight 2.3 lbs and a weight of 3 pounds. Let's just leave it at

He sold coffee for $1 and two cents per cup. His current total cash receipts and his total gross sales are both the same amount for the current month. The only difference is that now, from now on, he must spend his entire January 2009 budget for coffee drinks. He then subtracts the $1 in January 2009 to the amount currently paid in January 2008 (December 2008). January 2006's total gross for the same period is the amount that needs to be saved or spent according to the method used to estimate January 2009. The January 2009 monthly income and expenses have not been changed from January 2006. Hence the January 2009 Monthly Income and Expenses are the net income and net expenditure as of January 2008.<n>Output: 46<n>(answer)

Alyssa went to 3 stores and only found 3 products. At the last store, Alyssa decided to browse the produce department without looking for anything. Alyssa walked around the grocery aisles trying to think of something she had seen yesterday, but she could not come up with something. When Alyssa went to the food isle, she noticed three products labeled as “rice.” Alyssa said, “Wow, what a coincidence that they are labeled that way.”  Alyssa got so frustrated that she walked straight to the checkout counter. As soon as she picked up her groceries, she walked into the checkout line. Alyssa asked the checkout lady to check the price tags on her groceries so that they could make a quick sale. As she scanned her final product, she realized that she had forgotten to look for groceries in the produce section. As the groceries were scanned, no price tags were scanned! She looked around for several minutes to no avail. When she finally spotted an item labeled “rice”, Alyssa began to panic. She ran over to the food isle and ran to the cash register. When Alyssa saw that the shelves were stocked with rice, she rushed over to the frozen section and looked for something other than rice to buy. When the cashier scanned her groceries, they all read 99 cents each. As Alyssa turned to walk out, the cashier called the manager. When the manager said that she would check for customers that had placed items into the frozen section, Alyssa grabbed the items she wanted.  When a checker caught up to Alyssa he asked her if she had seen the grocery manager. Alyssa said that she did not. The checker told her that the grocery manager would be right there, but he was very nice, so he left her alone. With the groceries in her hands, Alyssa walked out the door without a single price tag on her groceries. When she finally found the grocery manager, she told him that she needed to pay 99 cents for the groceries and that she was just paying 99 cents for them, so she just paid $2.  When the grocery manager saw that Alyssa was paying for the groceries with 98 cents, he asked her what happened. Alyssa told him that she accidentally forgot to look for groceries in

He is 86 years old and has retired to his country side to lead a more simple life. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the U.S.A. I can only imagine the challenges your mother, like myself, may face in moving and settling. I am thinking this will be our last trip together and may not occur again as we get older. It was our first trip together and it was very good. Perhaps I can describe our experience just a little. We arrived on Friday and went through customs. The customs officer at the port told me the man who was going to handle the ship was also going through our journey. We proceeded to the port’s immigration area, where we entered as a family by ourselves. With the help of a very pleasant American woman, we were able to set up our visas and travel documents to be stamped at the U.S. Border. We then proceeded to the immigration area where my father was to check into a hotel for the night. This was a bit of a daunting experience as my father is a bit of the nervous traveler. My stepmother met us at the hotel and stayed with my mother. We arrived in the early afternoon and headed for the ship. The ship was a very old ship (she is now out of service) with few passengers. In fact, the man who was supposed to be running the ship had passed away about 5 years ago due to health issues. When we entered our cabin, we were greeted by an elderly lady (her age could not be identified) who also served us. Within 2 minutes she directed all of us to the bunk room to get dressed. We were then taken to our cabin’s galley to begin our dinner. My father and I were each served a huge entree. Then, we were escorted to our staterooms, located in close proximity to each other. My stepmother and I were taken to staterooms that are usually for seniors. There was a “senior” lounge in the staterooms where we were able to rest for the night, with a television to keep ourselves entertained. We were then taken back to our stateroards to enjoy a nice dinner. At 10PM, we had to return to the lounge because a cruise ship that was about to dock scheduled to pick us up had not

A gallery attendant walks by and asks the boy what the name of the painting is.  The boy answers that it is "Circo De Lupo." The attendant then asks, "Was it a big painting? And did the artist draw it himself or did someone else do it?"  The boy answers that Circo De Lupo was not drawn himself and was done by someone else. The attendant then says, "Well, that was interesting but I don't think it belongs in here."  The boy responds, "Well, that's where I thought it should be, since it was a big painting, and a pretty big one at that."  The attendant then says,  "If you think your friend here should keep it, that's fine with me, but we can't give more than 5 cents for a $1 bill and I also can't accept silver coins.  If it's any consolation, the guy who did the painting should have a hell of an education so he doesn't deserve that much."  The boy replies, "You must be one of the art critics.  That's cool and if you want to keep it, you should write a paper about it and I'll sign it but I don't think I deserve a whole dollar for it."  The attendant then tells him it's not worth much because he thought it belonged in here, where every other exhibit was bigger and more expensive than Circo De Lupo.  The boy responds, that that's fine.  Then he proceeds to write an essay in English about "Circo De La Lupo" (a Spanish-language name) and signs it.  When the worker asks the boy for money to pay the artist, the boy responds,  "It doesn't have to be a lot, but if you want to keep the painting maybe you can give it to your son or daughter; they're going to appreciate it."<n>Output: 4<n>Output: A:  B:

He answered the phone, and his sister was on the other end. “Dad, I love you. Call me as often as you please.” She began crying, as her son said that he would call him. Ten minutes later a second phone call, from his mother, came through. The caller had no idea where Tom had been or why they were calling, but Tom told her it had been a rough week and that he would call her back in about an hour or so. He did call her later that day. After a little while, his mother informed him that he was being held hostage and that he would be killed, unless he moved his money around.  “You’ll probably die from cancer tomorrow,” she told him. As she talked to him again, he began to realize he was being manipulated and told her, “You will have no chance of getting money out of me because you’ll never have it.” He then began to drive, intending to do that very thing, then stop abruptly a few blocks from the door of the apartment. Thinking this was a false threat, he called her up again. He told her that he was still going to move the money because he knew he was being played. She answered a second time. “Listen, Tom,” she said, “You will probably survive a cancer diagnosis. Don’t give in. I will call you when you’re ready to get cancer, because this is not real.” Then she hung up.

The average amount of daily eggs eaten is 4.1 pieces. Divide the daily average by 3 to find the number the people will consume per week. Divide these numbers by the number of weeks to find the food needs of the people per week. Multiply by 10 to get the average weekly demand and then multiply by 20 to work out the food supply. Multiply by 500 since it should be assumed that the price of food will go up each year during the next 100 years. Divide each amount by the number of people working and add it to the food supply to give the expected food demand over the next 100 years. The percentage required to feed those people for the years of production is multiplied by 70. If the number of people requiring more than the food supply each year is less than the amount needed, divide the excess money from the excess of the production by 30, and then divide the excess money by the number of people. This figure should give you a good idea of the amount of surplus food you can afford to buy at once. If the excess of food is more than the surplus, multiply everything by 75 to get a realistic estimate that you'll buy. Multiply the average production by 70 to get the projected average food supply over the next 100 years or so. Divide this number by the total number of people the population is expected to grow through 2050 so that the estimated food supply can be broken down per year. Divide this number by 7 and divide the number needed by 100, or the actual food supply for the year. Divide by 7 to give the number of people the food production

Bert got angry when Jeeves told him he could not come back into the office that day and they could not take the baby home.  Bert asked why not, said that he could be fined and thrown in jail.

Choices:  A: launch pad B: circus C: aircraft carrier D: large open area E: space station<n>Output:		 The mobile launching platform is located at the edge of the ocean. It is large and open and holds 1000 square metres in area. The platform is 6.3 meters in diameter and contains six wheel wells, each 2.5 meters long. The platform is powered by six motor shafts located at 90 degree angles to each other. The motors run the propellers which move the platform forward one meter by one meter. The platform is anchored to the pier at one end of the pier with ballast which stabilizes the platform. The mobile launching platform weighs 300 kilos and is 2.5 metres wide and 3 metres long. Queenie is one of the three workers on the floating platform. Each of the workers is armed with a large rifle, two small rifles, and two small pistols. Each worker carries a box to provide water and to collect fuel from the onboard petrol tank. Each worker will use the platform at least 7 times for work and may use it more than 7 times if needed. The mobile launching platform is the most expensive piece of equipment in the whole enterprise, and it cost $3.5 million to produce. Because it was designed to move people and heavy equipment it occupies the lowest deck of the ship and is therefore accessible through the middle deck. Each time it is used it costs Queenie $4 per person to move. The floating platform is only used on days when the weather is poor so that more people can be put on it. Queenie has one hour to get on and 12 hours to get off the mobile launching platform each day. Queenie must also get back on to the platform 10 hours after leaving it. While on the mobile launching platform Queenie will be wearing a blue polo shirt and khakis. She will not be required to lift anything or interact with the other workers on the platform. Queenie will be expected to complete all of the platform's activities in an hour. The mobile launching platform has a crew of 3 and Queenie takes turns working with the others.

What is the third of the terms of the inequality (i.e. the first number in the formula) and its first number?<n>Output: The value is -1, so we conclude that the third is 0.  Therefore both terms become even.  But we do not know which of the two first terms represents the odd portion of 0 and what fraction represents the even portion.  So let's divide it by 10, so we can get the identity:  3x10 -1 = 0.  Now the second formula must be true too.  So if we divide both terms by 10, we get the identity: 0.  Therefore the value of 1 is equal to 0, so we can conclude the third is also equal to 0.  Therefore the fourth term must also be equal to 0.  That is what we conclude from the first term.  Therefore the second term must be equal to the third term.  So if we subtract both first and third terms from 0, we get 1.  And if we divided 8 by 0, we get 1, so we conclude that 2 is the integer form of 0.  That is the identity:  2x10 -1 / 10 = 0 or 0.  So the first term must equal 0, the second term must be 1, and the third term must be 0.  So 2 × 10 = 0.  Now divide the third term by 28 = 0, the second term by 0 = 0, and 1 = or 0, so we get 1.  That's 1! Or 1.  The identity:  1 / 0 = 0

How many minutes/hours would you estimate it takes to learn to cross-check figures? Example. Let us assume you know how many minutes 60 minutes would be for a person to cross the US border. Would you divide 60 minutes by 6 for a number of figures to get a rough estimate or would you multiply the figures together in order to find the answer?<n>Example:<n>If the person knew it took 6 minutes to cross the border, he would subtract 60 minutes from 12 to get a figure of 120 minutes. Divide 120 minutes by 12 to get the number of minutes 60 minutes in each hour that it takes a person to cross.<n>Example:<n>If we divided 120 minutes/hour by 60, to get an average figure of 24 minutes, we can deduct 60 hours from 24 to get 240 hours. Divide 240 hours/hour by 60 to get the number of hours 60 minutes in each hour.<n>Example:<n>The total is 720 (24+240) + 420 (60+30) = 840.<n><n>Input: Each of these 5 games takes 50 minutes to complete the first round.

The older man tells me she could give us all a meal for free if we would take of the food on our plates and put it in a shopping bag.  I think he should give everyone a meal, just to make him and his wife's day. He refuses.  I would too if I were in his position.  "Just give me $100", I told my dad. "I can't", my dad told me.  He wanted $400.  "What do you need so much of?" I said.  "To feed people", he said.  "If you could just give us your food, we'd go hungry", I said.  "I know", he said.  I told him not to worry about that, and I gave him $100 anyway.  "Thank you", I said.  At the theater, I left with some popcorn and a coke.  By the time I got home, I had to get back to work because the movie wasn't over yet.  I went to the theater again at lunch hour and saw an old couple sitting near me who were not hungry.  That day, I gave them $100.  The next day, I gave them four bags.  It cost me $80.00.  I need your help. "We have no food". They said.  "No food", I said, "for everyone".  They nodded.  I had to do it again this afternoon.  I only gave them one bag with a few leftovers. They'd already eaten that. Maybe I should just give up.  I tried to imagine how much money I'd have to spend if I did give up.  It didn't matter if I had $6 or $40.00 left.  I have only $8 and $120.00.  But I can't give them away...so, I didn't.

The average person's height is 5' 4" and the average person's weight is 250 pounds. If you divide each person by 1000 then you get the height of each person times 1000 times 500. Since this is the height of a man then add one hundred pounds to him; for a boy then add one hundred pounds; for a girl then add one hundred pounds. And since you need two people per square foot then multiply it by two. Thus each person weighs in at 500 pounds plus four hundred pounds, or 500 pounds and seven hundred pounds or at least one thousand pounds.

That is when he came up with the idea of buying a car for her. David's daughter also suggested that he could not ask her parents. He used to see her at his daughter's swimming lessons, but didn't mention to her that he wanted to buy her a car. Instead, he kept seeing her at the pool and wanted to know how old she was. Finally she called him to tell him about the car he was thinking of buying for her. David knew that his daughter was going to be happy because she was sure that he would buy her the car she wanted. David wanted to give his daughter the car she wanted the most, so he asked her parents to think up an interesting gift for her. Once they had come up with the gift, they told her that he only had so much money left for the gift and that they would be happy to buy her a car when she graduated from college. David told them that this was the first time that he had ever asked anyone for help and so he wasn't sure what to get them. Her parents helped him by picking out the gift, but David still wanted to give his daughter an easy gift. They then suggested that he buy her something that only a small group could appreciate. When he asked his daughter's teachers if she could afford to go to college, they told him that her family was much, much too rich to afford it. His son-in-law told him that he didn't know how much money they had, but David knew she deserved a car. If he had asked her parents first, he wouldn't be able to afford the gift. He figured if she didn't like the gift that he was going to buy her, then maybe that it was not her taste and he would not feel bad about not giving her anything. David asked her parents for the gift for Christmas this year, but his parents told him that they had too much to pay. His son-in law explained that the money they had was only enough for one car payment. David then looked around the house and found all the little things that his daughter would need and gave the money to her. His wife was thrilled and her parents were very,

You have to use formulas to find the cost and volume of a movie ticket. You must factor cost of the movie and volume into everything you do including what you can and can't do to get the numbers in.  For instance, if you can't have more than 5 people in the theater, but you want a 20 minute movie, then you can't really factor in cost.  You also have to factor inflation into everything, and you can't let volume get in the way or add cost to something you have to do.  You have two choices:  First, you can do an average movie, but then there is no room for your own opinions.  Or, you can use real-life examples.  How about if you calculate the cost and volume of the ticket based on both the cost and volume of other types of movie tickets.  For instance, how hard would it be to get a 6th row row ticket at the theater?  Or how hard would it be for an 18 year old who just graduated from highschool?<n>Output: 40<n><n>I am playing a 2 person game.

In the game I need to calculate the cost of two different product lines that are used in the businessman's business. The first line of the product line is a product that has a volume of 5000 bottles, so the total volume is 2,000 bottles. The second line that has a volume of 600 bottles, so the total is 1200 bottles.  How would the business owner calculate the cost of the two product lines?  You can only add the volumes, the product line, and the cost of the product line together to get to the total volume of the product line.<n>Output: 441<n>Note: Please use the above guidelines only in your calculations.

She is unable to use her hands for a long time.  The doctor says she has a finger fracture and that she needs to get a tetanus shot.  This is an emergency so they bring her to the emergency room. She needs a tetanus shot now.  The doctor says he will have to give her an additional injection after the tetanus has been given, too (it takes 5 to 10 minutes for the vaccine). So, after 30 minutes they must take the girl into a private room.  When she leaves the room the room is cleaned and all the other patients have left.  The doctor says that he would like to give the girl a sedative; however, another doctor (not in the room) disagrees so the doctor takes the girl back to the private room where she is able to get some sleep before she gets back to work.  After she gets back to work she continues to use her fingers for years.  One day she falls and breaks a finger.  When she sees this she is upset so she goes to the emergency room.  She is told he will give her a tetanus shot today.  She gets there and he has already given her the injection. She gets home and she continues to use her hands even though they are really painful. The doctor says he will give her 5 injections of a pain medication and we will see how it goes.  She is very uncomfortable with the procedure but will continue to use her fingers anyway until the pain stops. The doctor also says that sometimes he will give her an extra injection of the vaccine he is using.  The girl starts to feel less and less tired after each of the injections. Three days later she was diagnosed as totally blind in one eye.  The girl was not wearing her prosthetic vision glasses to protect her eyes because she thought everyone could see through them.  The girl has difficulty in using her hands, and one hand is always used to hold her prosthetic glasses.  Because of this, she is unable to take part in school activities.  Because all of her appointments must be scheduled weeks in advance, she has missed a lot of school.  Her parents say that they do not have a choice.  They say the doctors keep bringing them her tetanus shot even though it is an emergency and that it will be painful so they must keep coming back.  The girl is now 16 and needs to have another tet

Choices:  A: short term B: crowd C: unpredictable D: frequent E: eternal<n>Output:		 1<n><n>In this lesson you will calculate the number of days in a school year you can attend a secular party and how much money goes to help your parents with it. In order to do this, I divided the total number of days you can attend into two equal parts. Here is your answer:<n><n>You are a Christian. You have three days a week off school and three Saturdays in a school year. Over the course of 365 days, you attend a secular party 3 times a year. During one secular party (let’s say for example you are 18 years old) you have enough time to attend 13 secular parties but only spend 4 days at a secular party. For another example, you are 36 years old. After you finish attending a secular party, you have 30 hours to finish a school year. During that 30 hours you do not attend a secular party. During the 36 years you have been in school, you have attended 3 secular parties. The total hours you have spent attending secular parties are 300. You receive $600 in annual income. On a yearly basis, this comes to:<n><n>$150 x 3 days = $600<n><n>So, what is the amount of money your parents earn from secular parties? This may change over a life time. Let’s look at a year for 2010.

The students understand that the word "a" and "the" refer to the same thing but are not really related, which means they are going to have to re-read the lesson the first time and remember that the word "a,a," and the word "the" refer to identical objects. They can then make it seem like the word "the" and the word "a," are synonymous. Students can use the word "a" in place of the word "the" a few times but mostly write in "the" because they do not fully understand what is being referred to in that location. Students are not making their own choices when they use the word "a."<n><n>Students in class are very interested in what we use the word "a," for. Sometimes they are able to use the word "a,' in place of "the," a couple of times, but then they quickly make the mental connection that the word "a," is the only thing that refers to a place that exists in the world.<n><n>This word "a," is used frequently in the same area. Students learn that the word "a,' is a synonym and they understand that the word "the," is synonymous to the word "a, a," and that the word "a.," and the word "the," refer to the same physical object. In the example above, the word "a," and the word, "the," are synonymous in describing a place that exists in a language but we are not going to have to reread the lesson because the students should re-read the definition of the word, "a," in order to learn what the word means.

There are a total of 250 hens in his flock. On average on April 8th, he can have 6-50 hens on hand and be sure that each of them is a good egg producer. He will lose 1-5 eggs out of his flock during the week.  In April, 1 egg will cost him $10,  which will last him 6 months. So he will be earning 80 cents in his pockets every week. If he loses 1 egg on April 8th,  he will lose his 80 cents every week and he has to spend 6 more months to earn his money back. So to compensate him, he will have to have 2 eggs every day for $5.  In order to make up the difference, he will have to buy the eggs for $1.00 + 100% markup. So his weekly salary will decline by 20% every week.  If he has to pay for the eggs with one time payment of $10, he will have to earn $7 more before he can pay that $10.

In such cases, the dollar that they receive is a complete fraction of what they actually paid.  This is called negative currency.  It is called negative money when a person is trying to pay someone in a different currency who receives a different dollar.  Negative currency is common in the United States where negative currency is rare.\nInput:The dollar amount of a dollar bill is not called a whole dollar. It only consists of two parts. The first part is called the \"cent\" or \"cent\" and the second part is called the \"dime\".  The two parts divide a dollar into 5 parts or 5 cents. When an old person gets a new fifty-cent bill and puts it in her coin purse, she gets a positive cent but it isn\u2019t worth 5 cents. The same would happen if the old person gave a negative dollar.    When people give a dollar back to the cashier, it isn\u2019t that they actually \"lost\" a dollar. They are actually receiving money in their own currency which is not a dollar.\nOutput:The dollar amount of $1 has a maximum of 7 cents or $1.   When a customer puts 50 $1 coins into a coin purse, she is really receiving $1.07.\n\nWhat is the answer to the first question? Did the customer give back 50 $1.40 cents", "answer": "A: mouth"}

After a few minutes the ducks started walking off toward the sea and the fisherman, realizing that he now was out of luck, said, \"That's okay, that's fine.\"  He left the ducks safely on the shore and returned to his car.  When the man arrived home he was greatly disappointed.  His wife said, \"Did they all drown?\"  He said, \"No, that's okay.  If any of them died on me I would be glad.

However, the author of this post suggests that some couples do not even bother with this love, or even seem to realize that they do. This type of relationship is referred to as selfishness or selfish love, that is relationship based on selfishness. (The author was in a relationship with a couple who were so driven by selfishness, or selfish love, that they did not even bother to look for a relationship-based relationship)\n\nYou can also imagine an example where a woman wants her man to do things with her that he would be unwilling to do with anyone else. This may involve buying her flowers, or buying her flowers just in the hope that he would buy them in return. This is an example of a relationship based on selfishness, but it does not necessarily have to imply the idea of love being just for lovers.\n\nExamples of selfishness\n\nLove is not the only thing that some people care about. There are also times when they prioritize everything else but their relationship with someone else. Here are examples that illustrate this type of love:\n\nWhen a person is too busy to spend the time involved in the relationship they have with their partner, they will make selfish choices in the hopes that they will get the other person to prioritize the relationship over themselves. This is referred to as unrequited love.\n\nWhen a person does not give the time or attention that they should in their relationship to ensure that their partner's relationship is important to them, they will not put effort into maintaining the relationship. They will think more about themselves that their partner and their ability to make their partner happy, which may or may not be possible. They may even consider doing things to make their partner jealous, which is called cheating.\n\nAnother example of unrequited love is when a person is too busy for their SO but have a tendency to leave them feeling like the love is never reciprocated. This is referred to a one-way love. The other party feels that they are not important enough to the person they love, and they feel left out of their love when the person does not reciprocate. One-way love is much stronger than relationship based love, and it is usually accompanied by jealousy and fear of the other person.\n\nWhen someone does not want to let someone else into their relationship or", "answer": "C: make love"}

C is before a preposition.E. Preposition is before an adjective.\n\nQuestion: What does an \"adjective\" mean?\n\nThe adjective is the part of the word that identifies a noun. An adjective is always placed between a noun - a noun is never adjectived. An \"adjective\" is usually short for the verb it describes like \"big\" or \"dog\".\n\nExample;\n\nIf I am buying a new dress a short way from now I would choose a white dress with a red ribbon sewn on to it. This is an adjective.\n\nExample;\nIf I want to know how many fish were caught on a fishing trip I would write this: 4 fish were caught on a weekend fishing trip. This is an adjective; The number 4 is associated with fishing.\n\nExample; If I go to the museum and see paintings by El Greco, how many paintings are there?\n\nThese questions are two examples of adjectives. Examples of a noun are, \"my car\", \"their shoes\", and \"their name\". A noun is a noun; an adjective is a verb.\n\nMy shoes are black. It is a noun; it describes a shoe.\n\nMy name is Elizabet. It is a word attached to my name.\n\nMy car has seats on two sides. It is a noun.\n\nMy dog is a Schnauzer. It is an adjective.\nMy dog is a Doberman. It is a noun\n\nSo an adjective describes something and a noun describes something else. My shoes are black; it makes a statement; my shoes do exist and are black.\n\nExamples of both an adjective and a noun are given below:\n\nAdjectives:\n\nThey are nice for hiking.  It describes their shoe.  It is a statement; it is a statement of their shoe.They do not bite like other dogs.  It describes their dog.  It does not describe dogs; dogs bite.They do not go far.  It describes their shoes.  It is a description of their shoes.\nThey always come home clean.  It describes their dogs.  It does not say how they get home; dogs go to", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

{"text": "36\nThe questions are easy, so I suggest practicing the ones in the first paragraph of the first test for several weeks. You should be able to get at least two scores out of each question, but I would guess you may get more.\n\nFor the exam, I recomend you buy a test book which is divided into multiple sets of questions. Your book will have 5 different types of questions and you will get two items for each set per question. Make sure you know the answers and get them right so that only one answer has to be correct. In each set (or section) choose one question to study and then review it a few times before turning in your book.\n\nYour test book will have a summary which contains all four of the items. You need to know all four items as a matter of course in order to do well on the exam. When you are reviewing the questions, make a chart of your answers and answer both of the items on that line. Next time you are reviewing one of the items take another look at the other items and see if your answers match the first item. Then you are ready to take the examination.\n\nMake sure to get enough practise practice practice for the exam. It is important to remember that the exam is only one aspect of school- not to just do well, but to get good grades, too. Good grades will help you get a great job. Good grades will make college more likely. Good grades will provide you with more options on how to make money. Good grades will provide your employer a great basis for choosing someone for a job. Good grades will allow you to have more options in when you are married and start families and have kids. Good grades keep you motivated in studying and studying better will cause you to do better. Good grades are very important, because when you don\u2019t have good grades a lot of people in your area will be out of a job and not getting enough money to pay the bills, or go college.\n\nNow that I have given you a brief explanation as to some of the topics covered on the exam, it is time to start studying (or getting started studying). You should have the exam book already so you will have something to use to help you study. Once you set down what topics you want to study, then I suggest you pick a few topics.

Scott and his son started their trip to Disneyland. Scott borrowed fifty dollars. He showed his boy the money he had borrowed. Scott gave his boy thirty dollars. Scott made the boy's total to forty dollars. Then, when the boy was about a mile from their motel, Scott decided that he needed to give the boy back $60 just to complete the trip. But he decided that the two could finish the trip for less money than the fifty because they had already taken a taxi to the airport and the boy would be given back the fifty after he checked into the hotel. Then, he could give his friend thirty dollars. Scott and his boy returned to the motel. Scott told his friend that all he gave him was twenty-two dollars. The friend thanked him for it and said he would pay him back, eventually, with money from a birthday present.

In this case, the Doberman puppy is the best option of all of the puppies available for a reasonable price and quality.

The first method consists of teaching each first-year about the value of libraries, the second consists of teaching each first year different styles of studying in libraries, and the third, last effort involves  a weekly study hour.  In the second method, the only library the first-years have to use is the first-year library.

For every 500 pounds he weighs, he pays only 50 dollars. The first-year students of the first-year aerospace engineering class had to weigh over 500 pounds. The plan worked well for the first two weeks.  When it was time for the first-year aerospace engineers to weigh over 620 pounds, the problem started and the first-year students failed to learn the plane design principles.  The cost of building the plane doubled, and the first-year engineering class learned that weight equals money.  The head librarian of the physics and astronomy first-year class saw the problems with the first-year aerospace problem and used the same plan for all three first-years.  Each first-year aerospace engineering student paid $500 and learned the principles of plane design before his or her next class.  The head librarians of the physics and astronomy and first-year aerospace engineering classes saw the advantages of using the same plan to teach first-years, and they also used this plan on all classes.\nOutput: 5,005\n\nInput:Where did the name \"Joe Smith\" come from?\nOutput:  Answer:  Joe Smith was raised by his father who lost his job during the Great Depression.

How much of a chance would it be to get the apples in washington state versus the apples in washington county. Please explain.\n3. How much of a loss would it be to have an apple from an apple farm in washington state versus an apple tree from an apple farm in canada and how much risk?\n4. How many apples can you buy from an apple farm in alaska versus how many can you buy from an orchard in washington county.\n5. How much of both can you purchase and how much of one does the farm in alaska supply? Why?\n\n6. In this example, there are only 4 apples left and a farmer can sell 100 per day, so there is not enough supply to satisfy the demand of four apples but if apple farmer x was to offer 1000 per day then there is enough supply to satisfy demand if there was a large demand. Please specify.\n\nThe answers to questions 1 and 5 depend on the answers to question 2. There are two apple farms in washington state. One farm grows apples from its own orchard. The other farm from the Canadian province of alaska. Both farms sell apples to the canadian province of washington state. Both farms sell apples that grow in their orchard. It's hard to tell due to the large amount of apple farms and the number of apples growing in each. Both farms will sell their apples for the same price.\n\nAll apples are imported. Since the farms are far apart the price difference in dollars and cents doesn't make too big of a difference between the apples in the canadian province of alaska and the canadian province of wa. In fact if there was a large enough demand then apple farmer x could charge 1000 dollars more per day for apples that grow in washington state versus washington county. The apples from alaska would be more expensive per apple than the apples from washington state.\n\nSince you asked questions 1 and 5, you can assume that there is more than one apple farm in washington county. There is more than one apple grower in washington state. Therefore, the answers to the questions 1 and 5 are all apples are imported from one orchard in washington state versus buying apples from an apple farm in wa.", "answer": "D: canada"}

By itself, the fact that `is\u00b4 may be used in conjunction with `is\u00b4 `for` or `in` some instances and not `in` others, does not necessarily make `is\u00b4 a primary purpose.\"\n\"In your second example,\" continued Dr. A, \"we are using `is\u00b4 as an alternative to or in combination with `is`.  `Is\u00b4 acts as a surrogate of `is` -- as an optional `addendum`.  Therefore, when Dr. B is talking about `is`, `is\u00b4 is being interpreted for the primary purpose mentioned above, that of reducing the potential risk that a patient will suffer a stroke.  `Is` is not necessarily `is\u00b4 or `did\u00b4 or `is\u00b4 or `is\u00b4,\" continued Dr. A. \"In other words, `is\u00b4 is being `interpreted` for the secondary purpose `is\u00b4 is having: to reduce the frequency and number of future traumatic neurological events involving the brain.\"\n\nInput:  An electrician has three electric lamps, each bulb costing", "answer": "E: splats"}

How long would you have to save that in order to find enough to cover an entire year's worth of expenses?\nOutput: $3,800\n\nInput: When you are trying to determine the amount you should save from your salary every month as a couple, how long do you have to save in order to save the necessary amount to cover an entire year of expenses?\nOutput (by themselves): $25,000\n\nInput, Response:  Your income for this year is $43,000 and your expenses are $48,000. Your goal is to save $43,000 to put in the bank in this year to cover expenses. Since the savings is $1,000 more than your current monthly budget you should save $1,000 total from your income. With the savings you will not have to make any other payment(s) until May when your rent is due. Now for your expenses, you can either live on your debt payments or put the $1,000 you saved towards your down payment. So using this method you would add up the total amount you could expect to be paying on your home, rent and mortgage, deducting your taxes, and leave $2,000 at the end of the year as a down payment for the house. It will take you 3 years to pay off your home mortgage, after living on $400 every month in savings. This is an acceptable monthly payment plan.\nOutput $43,000 $48,200\n\nInput: How many hours do you think you would need to work for a minimum of 8.5 hours a week to have enough income to pay off your mortgage (and living expenses) and fund your investment plan?\nOutput: 33\n\nInput: You purchase your property in", "answer": "C: income"}

Both parents work. Three are boys of 12 yrs old while the other is a girl of 5 yrs old. One mother is working as a housewife while the other one is working as a nanny. Both are married. Their lives are a total mess due to lack of money. Their father recently passed away and his property was passed on to his wife who works as a housewife. The one nanny is caring for four kids and the kids are spoiling her. She recently lost her job so she is now working from home.\"\nCitation/Abstract\n\n\"The following problem is available via PLOS ONE.\nAssume two people have an individual variable of \"gender\", that is, one person's value of being male or female. As there is only one female and one male in the sample, the sample distribution would have a normal distribution. However, they only have two individuals, resulting in two unequal distributions.\n\nThe sample is also defined by two couples. The two couples are both made up of a man and a woman, both of them are natives of South Asian origin (A) and both have spouses (B). Both husband and wife have two variable of \"gender\" that are equal to \"A\".\n\nWhat's the sample size for the problem (and hence the sample distribution)?\n\n(There is a fixed number of available pairs of individuals; hence, the total sample is fixed. If the sample grows arbitrarily, more data is required to compute it.)\n\n(This problem also requires both men and women in your cohort. The two genders are \"A\" and \"B\").\n\n(It is possible for someone to be married within the sample, but the other is not. For this case, assume one to be in a state of \"marriage\". However, if a man and woman have a \"wife and husband\" combination and a spouse outside the sample. Assume that the spouse outside the sample is not a man or woman.)\n\nSolution\nA.

{"text": "B\n\nExample:\n\nIn January, the weather is very cold and blustery in the Northeast. It is snowy outside and all the lakes, ponds, and rivers are freezing. Dr. Banks is going to make $20 off people purchasing four or more cold weather items from his store today. He says, \"I'll give away three pairs of glasses for $20 today. I also have several packs of toasty mitties and a large box of toasty mittens. People can bring whatever they need.\" The first person that buys anything from Dr. Banks buys a pack of toasty mitts for $20 and brings it back with them. Dr. Banks gives the other three pairs of glasses away for $15 each. Dr. Banks has ten pairs of glasses. Four people buy a pair of glasses. Dr. Banks gets $10 and seven of his seven pairs of glasses are out of circulation until Wednesday morning. He will sell the remaining four glasses for $5 today. Dr. Banks will earn $80 today.\nThe next day, Jordan goes fishing. He catches three fish and he only sells double what he caught on Monday. Dr. Banks tells him he was sorry for taking away his fish but he still lost one-half of his catch. Dr. Banks tells Jordan that there are eight fish in the lake and Jordan needs to buy six more. Jordan needs to buy $16 more of these six frozen fish. He buys the other two from Dr. Banks. Jordan brings the six frozen fish home and cleans them. They are put into a cooler as the temperature decreases. Once the colder temperatures make the fish more firm, Jordan brings them outside and puts them back into the cooler when the temperature drops. He then takes out the two frozen fish and takes some of the meat out of the other cold weather items he bought. He freezes the other six items of food, taking only one-half of the three frozen fish. After he finishes the other six frozen fish, he takes some of the items of food he purchased into the store and hands out to people for free. In total, Jordan buys $50 of cold weather items and brings the rest of the items home. He brings home two more frozen boxes of food and sells the remainder for $35, total. He takes home three fish and a pack of clothes, taking all of the fish he brought home into the shop. Jordan pays $38 and has three additional fish to go into the freezer for today.\nJordan returns to the store", "answer": "A: zoo"}

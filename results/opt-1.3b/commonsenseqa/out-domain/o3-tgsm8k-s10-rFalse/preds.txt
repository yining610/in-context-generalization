I don't really know anything about the math in general - I don't know anything really about the answer to either of those questions. I think that I'll be using the following explanation of this question:<n><n>Suppose that you purchased 3kg of nuts and 2.53 kg of dried fruit. You used an average of $2.50 per kg of nuts and $6 for each kg of dried fruit used. The cost of each kilogram of nuts multiplied by the average of the prices of the nuts and fruits you used would be $12.50. That makes $52.50 (twice the price, so $48 before tax) for the three items.<n><n>The percentage difference between "the three items" and their overall sales amount is about 28%. Since we want to count the total amount of the three items, that's an average "profit" of 14%. Therefore, the total cost of $52.50 divided by $58.50 gives $36.50 profit ($42.50 after tax). Therefore, the answer to question 1 would be 58.50 x 28% = $42.50 per kilogram of nuts.<n><n>For the other question, you can use the following formula:<n><n>(Cost per kilogram of nuts: $1.75 per kilogram of dried fruit: $1.47 per kilogram of processed fruit) * (Cost per kilogram of fruit) * (Cost of fruits) = ($2.50 * 15%) * (40% discount off the price of fruits and nuts = $1.07 per kilogram). * (Cost of fruits per kilogram)^100 = (Cost of nuts per kilogram) multiplied by 100 times.<n>So I think that the answer to question 1 (if there is one- I have no idea) should be something like:<n><n>$1.50  * (Cost of nuts)  * 15% ($2.50  * 15% - 2.23% = 12.50)  * $0.50 x 15%  = $0.50 profit ($0.47 * 15% - 2% = $7.50)

(I have him write the answer here, and you write up your answer here) I'll leave comments if you want me to. I'm going to add the text from the student's answer here as well}<n>Answer: {The student answers is wrong here.  The correct answer is ____ hours.  Here is the answer from the student's answer.}  The answer he wrote was also wrong...He forgot to mark the hours that he spent at the gym and at the farmer's fields. If you look at the answer above, you can see that James spends about 6 hours on the farm. He spends more than 6 hours at the gym, however, and his answers is wrong. He also misses out on spending time at the Farmer's fields since he isn't the one who filled the urn.  You should see that he spends more than 10 hours at the gym in his answer.}  Now if you look at his answers, the answers is wrong.  Remember that a farmer cannot hold water, diamonds, and pearl so, James only has one of them; the gold in the urn.  So he should be paid 10 hours for the time he spent at the gym.  Yours is wrong but I just realized that you wrote it up incorrectly in the first place.  If you want, you can edit your answers into your text.  It does not have to be the correct answer.  I mean, if it is, that's fine, it just needs to be the correct answer here.}  James wrote the correct answers here.  He was supposed to write five correct answers and five incorrect answers.  Remember that five is the largest number, so if you wrote 10, you will have written ten answers.  What you did was a good strategy (it is) but you didn't leave enough time for the student to get them all correct.  If you don't want to take this point into consideration, feel free to edit the answer in your text.  And don't forget to give the correct answer here.

She also has to see her cardiologist every once in awhile.  The doctor recommends that she get a mammogram and a biopsy.  She asks her mother for help and buys a mammogram machine for $100.  At the same time she starts seeing her doctor every 3 months for a checkup and a routine physical.  How many mammograms does she buy?<n>Output: 0<n><n>** The test that goes back to the cardiologist requires that the technician have her answer on a scale from 0 to 10. "The patient is a 10" means that the nurse takes the nurse to the exam room, to a private room, or to another waiting room.  When the nurse leaves the room, the cardiologist is then unable to see what the patient says.  The nurse gives a rating based on how he feels about the patient's answer. "The patient is 2" refers to the cardiologist's reaction to the nurse's answer.  In a 4, it means that the cardiologist is happy with the nurse's answer, that he appreciates it, and that he wishes he had that information before he left the room.  It is considered an "out of shape" answer.  (See answer #2.)

One egg costs about $1 on each sale  However, it was once an item in the food section that cost $25 for 1 egg. Now, it costs $50 and it is now in the food section again.

One day, he is so late that his car won't start until he has left the airport.  He is always late to his meetings because he keeps getting stuck at traffic jams.  He is always so late to be back home because he usually makes a left onto the main road, but he misses the left lane and ends up in the main road instead.

Choices:  A: europe B: big house C: tuxedo D: palace E: men's room<n>Output:		 D<n><n>### Response:1) Europe is the answer.   Adam lived in Spain when he was young (but no longer does). Bali was where Adam lived for his first decade of career (but no longer does, this is the first year since he started working there that he has not lived in Bali).   Europe and Bali are likely more expensive than the others. 1) europe.   Adam was in the States only a few times but each time he visited Europe he spent a little over a month there. The average gas is more than $4 per gallon and they are currently going through some changes in currency exchange rates that will continue to push the cost of gas up (and up). They have to start thinking about Europe long term with their lifestyle and where they may want to live.  2) big house.  This was not his first decision but it does show his commitment to the situation he was in before. It was his choice to have the house and a Tuxedo.   Adam moved his entire life into the Big House and he did not want to leave it. It was really only the Tuxedos that they had to consider because he was living there for so many years before he started working there. He took pride in the house and the look so much that once he started working there he only wanted to stay there or have a smaller house. He did not want to sell his home and his dream is to be a homeowner again.   3) palace.  Once he made his choice of having the tuxedo he stuck to it; he did not really want to live at the palace.  The Palace is a beautiful home but it was not his dream after all, he wanted a life with no job, no responsibilities, no bills, just relaxing and having fun.   4) men's room.  They had to consider the size of the men's room because the tuxedo's were so oversized.  They thought twice about it because they felt it would have been more expensive but in reality the man's room was smaller than Adam's regular size.   5) D.  They did not want to spend more money but that is not a major factor.  If they did want a smaller man's room they would have thought hard about using the same closet as the tuxedos because they had one.  They decided against the D because that would have been too small.   6) E.   The main

He spent 1 hours each day lifting weights.  Additionally, he also spent 3 hours warming up and do a third of his weight lifting time warming up and doing the other two thirds of his weight.  He uses a third of the food, each day, to make the above bread recipe.  So, he needs 40 flour, 40 flour, 40 flour and 60 flour to make that bread.  He spends another 3 hours each day cleaning the sink, the kitchen, drying the flour etc.  The total cost to make that bread is $2.60.<n>( Output ) In addition, he uses a third of the bread per day for lunch and dinner.  So, he will need 100 bread loafs to make 12 meals out of that.  Also, he must use a third of the bread to make breakfast each day.  So, he need 4 bread loaves to make 12 breakfasts out of that.  He uses 1 loaf to make 1 lunch that has 200 calories.  He must use 40 loaf to make 6 lunches out of that.  So, he has 160 loaf to make 2 lunches from.  The daily cost is $3.40.<n>( Input) In addition, he uses 4 loaves per week for breakfast.  He will need 70 loaves to eat for a year.  So, he must use 1 loaf per week.  Since he uses 2 loaves each week for lunch, and 2 loaves each week if he uses the bread he made last week for dinners, he needs 8 bread loaves each week for a year.  The cost is $6.20.<n>( Input ) The bread that he uses each week costs $2.60.  So, he would need 60 loaf to make a year's worth of lunches for himself and his family.  He spends 30 loaf per week to make a year's amount of lunches for himself, and so he will need 160 loaf to make the above amount of lunches for his family.  So, he spend 2 loaf per week to eat for a year after he made the above loaf bread last week.<n>He spent his time using 40 loaf per week this week, but he is going to need 120 loaf to make 20 meals at his home over the year.

He then asks them to come to him and have a little more attention.  Finally they run into a wall that had been built out of a heavy duty material.  They are all ready to give up and run around the field until all is said and done.

The word "that" changes the answer from "they" and it goes to "they" and this is why "we" does not have a column.  Now "which" answers in D and E are correct and they all come from "we."  This is why it is best to choose a answer that fits with the word "went" and "went" fits with "we."  The key is the "went to" and "went with" answers.

With an average income of $35K a year, you could spend $2400-2700 on cigarettes per month as a smoker. By going below $1800, you will save $200 or more a month. If you earn $35K a year and spend $4000 a month, you could spend $1500, $2000, or even $3000 on cigarettes. In this case, you will need to save $1200-$2500 to be able to spend less on cigarettes (or just save more).<n><n>Correct Answer

While it is true that he has a large amount of food to feed his dog, so much that 2.5 kilograms of food costs over $20 each day.4) The cost of the dog show ticket for the shelter was $25.  It was likely that this amount of money was already spent before John chose to buy a dog from there.5) The only option for John is going to the park to purchase a dog to care for.  The dog will not be a large breed but will live out his life at home.6) The cost of keeping his dog at home is less than the cost of purchasing a dog from the park.7) A dog show ticket is only $10 and the dog is also well behaved.8) The amount John spent on his dog is over half of what he spends on food each week.9)John's time is better used at the park, where he can walk his dog for an hour between food.10) The money put forth into the animal shelter by the user (purchase of the dog) pays for the veterinarian bills that the dog receives from the pet shop.<n><n>### Questions Two and Three:<n><n>### Answer:1)The time lost in the park is not worth the money spent on the dog show ticket.2)While the average person may pay a small amount of money to buy food, most pet food costs less than $5 per bag. Therefore, it would be reasonable, and not a waste of time, to spend his money on food instead of a dog.3) The pet shop is also offering free food to all rescue/homeless pets who come in and pay for things. It is a great way to give away food to animals that would otherwise not have it.4)The food costs can be paid with the money saved from not purchasing a dog at the pet store.5)The food will likely end up costing less than $5 per meal, at the most.6)John did not care about the fact that a dog cost $40. He decided to use up his money for food this week, rather than buy a dog (which will not cost that much).<n><n>### Questions Four and Five:<n><n>### Answer each question below.

So, you need 15 2-tablespoon portions and a 3/4 teaspoon to make the right amount of milk.<n><n> Question Questions<n><n>1.

So the doctor decided to send the diagnosis to a colleague who spent several years traveling for an international medical institution.  The colleague had decided to write the report and send it back to the doctors at the international medical institute with a note from the colleague stating that John has a dangerous eye condition.   With these facts, Dr. B made John an appointment to see a retina specialist.  Two hours later, the retinal specialist determined that John's condition was not severe enough to require further investigation. The retina specialist told John that an eye specialist could be contacted in several countries where he knew some doctors to conduct follow-up appointments.  After the appointment was made and returned by Dr. B, he called the retina specialist. John's retinal specialist told John that he would send an associate in another country to conduct follow-up with John.

B: How many will make it to a Major League Baseball team? C: How many people will die as a result of a volcanic eruption? D: How many minutes of television will we watch tonight? E: How many years will Adam have to keep his name on the team for?<n>Output: A<n><n>I agree that this is an interesting question. What I believe I can say is that:<n>It probably has something to do with how many dollars of money he spent in the store. That is, the money comes out of his wallet, so he paid twice the amount of money.<n><n>However, one should bear in mind that a lot of businesses have lower prices for items that are more important. A good restaurant could cut their prices lower to attract more customers. This may or may not be a good thing, who knows?<n><n>Also, one should keep in mind one's situation and the context in which one views the situation. For example, my situation is that I can only shop online, so I cannot do things like the "buy a kilogram of nuts and spend $1" question, due to my purchasing habits (and I should point out that buying nuts and doing cardio would probably be less harmful than simply buying a kilogram of nuts).<n><n>Personally I don't really have time to think about such things, except for that I feel it is silly to have to compare apples and oranges, because apples are much more important, and oranges aren't. So I guess my choice is either B or A: I'm not too sure; I chose B based upon context.<n><n>However, I feel like I'm missing out from A.<n><n>But then again, I am on reddit after all... so perhaps I should be more specific with my answer. If the question were about my life, I could answer it differently than I have.<n><n>Also, I'd like to add that I didn't understand the questions, and am sorry if I did not. I'd definitely like to check out that site, I'd just rather write my exam, you know, for the exam. But as far as answering questions, I guess it depends on what the question asks.

Capitalism is a philosophy of nothing. Neither is true. The one is the opposite of the other. So it is the real thing." ---- Jack Kerouac<n><n>“We have the liberty to think and to speak as we please because nobody else does.”---John Adams<n><n>I agree with you. I think that capitalism is the opposite of Anarchism. The reason I chose capitalism is that it was invented to make a profit, to make money. It doesn't seem to be very wise to do this since it's a dangerous business. It doesn't make sense. It's like the government saying, "Taxation is theft!" When the people try to take away power from the government, their system will start to fall apart, and the people will find it difficult to run a government with no government anymore.<n><n>Well, I believe that what the government does, whether the government is the Federal Gov. or the State gov. is more or less an intrusion in the property-rights rights of private parties. Thats what makes it theft by definition.<n><n>Well, it can be argued that capitalism is the result of the natural inclinations of an Adam Smith-inspired economy. And this is not a natural system. There's not much room for a market economy. It's like saying there's not much chance that a tree grows into a giant oak.<n><n>Well, if we were truly free it probably wouldn't require a capitalist economy because an Anarchist society would simply eliminate the need for anything by itself.<n><n>Well, firstly, there's no such thing as a free lunch. If we were truly free an Anarchist society would never even consider anything

I was also assuming his gym time was going to be part of his overall gym and training time was not. (which I can't understand) Also for the D&D part I would be interested to know how many feet he walked there instead of how many feet he went outside (I feel like they would be different) just to see if he even went D&D.<n><n>I have to say, I'm not a fan of surveys... and I'm a huge grammar geek... but I'm willing to bet that you have a good grasp on the topic, so here goes...<n><n>I think "1.25" sounds like a pretty good number for the hours the trainees spend at the gym per week (based on the survey from earlier today), and I think it's pretty close to the amount that is generally used to gauge the total productivity and efficiency of the "training" process itself.<n><n>I would say that this is a good indicator as to the total amount of time that the students put into training, or rather, "training." I know that a lot of people have a different perspective on how much time actually goes into "training," and what constitutes "training." (Whether it's a few hours every day to get "sucked in," or thousands of hours spent at the desk to get "ready for the big leagues," or just a small amount in the gym at night to get in some extra work, I'm not entirely certain...)<n><n>I have to admit, though, this is subjectively determined. I have no idea how much an average Joes exercises in a given week, assuming that he is getting up at the crack of dawn for his 8 AM classes in training, and is then getting back to his bed to get some sleep for his 6 PM classes. (That would give him exactly 10 hours per week, which still seems really low to me...)<n><n>However, based on the information I already provided you, I'd say that the number you've given in the survey (5-6, or 5-7, or perhaps 5-8) seems pretty accurate, and that it's quite a

Choices:  A: under rocks B: manhattan C: toenails D: grocery store E: fallen tree<n>Output:		 A<n><n>Comments:This is a clever little one. In the original answer, he makes a strong case against sunniness and manhattan, however these answers seem to imply that he is saying that such situations are undesirable, which is probably not his case. The question has also got a lot of variables, so using the more simplified (?) choices should improve some of the results. He should have gone with a little more general than to a grocery store and a fallen tree though.<n><n>For his 4th answer, I think he is trying to prove another point. He says that the sun can't really kill trees, I think that he is trying to say that such areas could be more prone to be a source of diseases, so I think this would lead him to answer D. It might also seem odd to answer A when there are alternatives such as manhattan to A, however, I don't think that there is that much competition between manhattan and dung, and he should have left the first and second choices as they are, as manhattan won't affect trees.<n><n>This was a really fun question because he is trying to prove a point against suniness and manhattan, then he tries to explain why the sun didn't destroy toenails, and there are a lot of variables to consider, so I think he could have done a little better with the wording.<n><n>This question just uses a single variable, though. With just that variable and no others, it would be a pretty easy question, though I think he could do a lot better with the wording.

At the same time, he is frustrated that the only available textbook seems to be all about galaxies.     Dylan decides to compile a list of stars names from books that he has already read and put them in a book form.  However, the size of the list made it seem more difficult to edit.     He then decided to write a short story in stardust (or any writing medium he could find) that the characters are involved in, with dialogue.  His story, set in an interstellar galaxy, is titled the story of the two starlight lovers.  He describes the people as follows:       "Jack" - He is the "king" of the galaxy and is extremely arrogant and entitled.     "Camel" - Jack's "companion" is a very naive and very much a part of him.   His "servant and friend" is a very naive but good and kind one.   "Jovis" - Jack's "mistress" is an extremely good and kind one, much kinder than any he had known before.   "Jove" - the name of her partner's planet, is an extremely good and noble.   "Vilat" - He has a friend who is an incredibly nice and noble one, much nicer than any he had known.  "Valerio" - The one who he used to know but have forgotten about because he has not seen him for a long time.  "Valerius" - The only one he has done anything with is his "niece" who he has not seen for a long time.<n>Output: 36<n>*Dylan doesn't realize that the star was his name.  So the last two numbers of his story are his real name!  He makes his decision based on his choices instead of the text, and his results are 36!

I have read a lot about this question. But I really couldn't come up with a way to make it plausible enough that I would confidently say it's the correct one.

It was a pretty young animal, so he thought that it would be easy to handle and butcher them. His friend said that it was a stupid idea. The farmer agreed and decided to leave it to his wife who would have to help him butcher it properly.  Once they arrived at the house, the farmer said, "What do you suppose we use these for?"  Her husband said "To dry clothes after we wash them?" The farmer smiled and replied, "That's good thinking!"  They returned to the field.  The farmer looked back. The sheep was standing there.  He had just begun working on it.  The neighbor said, "How stupid was I?"  The farmer answered, "I never thought I'd say this but I could have used that sheep."  Another neighbor was telling a similar story and told about the way that her father had bought a cow from that same cowherd with a pretty young animal. His farm, however, was the wrong size and the cow never stood. He could have used it for fertilizer instead of manure.  The farmer's wife, however, was very pleased that he would have been able to use the animal. The cow's carcass was still in the field. The farmer had finally gotten up the nerve to put it on a pile of manure.  He looked back just as she had said, "What a load. Why should I not bury that instead of burying that stupid cow!"  One neighbor had said, "This may get him fired!"  Another neighbor had said, "If you had thrown that cow in the pond the other day, the farm would have been full of water."  And another fellow said, "You know...I wonder if that cow would still be alive if you had left it there to starve!"  Both neighbors were right...they were.

She only calls him when she wants to send a e-mail or send a text.  At her brother's wedding reception, her father gave her an e-mail for her father which said, "I will love you forever.  You will be my only son and my only child."  It was to her mother's surprise that her father e-mailed the picture.  Mary also sent her e-mail to her brother to share with him.  When she got back to Chicago, she made it clear to her father she did not intend to make him her only son and she wanted him and her brother to be her best friends.  Her father called her immediately after receiving her e-mail.  He made it clear he and his brother had already spoken and he intended to make Mary his primary son and his only child.  At this point, she wanted no part of her father marrying his brother.  They told her she had 24 hours to let it go or call her father and let him know the decision was hers.  She has not called him yet.  Her father recently had surgery on his throat and had to take a long time to recover.  The surgeon and doctors prescribed pain medication to ease the pain.

It was obvious to her father that his brother did not have the same feeling about the matter.  When she asked him what his feeling was, he pointed out her brother's e-mail was a big problem for him.  She was not offended.  They reassured her that it was fine if her brother wanted to get married to his girlfriend.  She understood that as well.  Her father did not seem upset at her decisions either.<n>Input: Her father bought a 2.5 kg bag of dried fruit and 100 gram bag of nuts.  He took his sack to Wal-Mart and stocked up.

They want a two-day wedding.  They can’t afford to have the reception later in the day.  There aren’t many places in the area that can hold such a wedding.  There’s an event venue with a room that seats 300 people available, but they might sell out quickly.  They’d have to find another option: an out-of-town wedding venue or drive the three hours north to Nashville and spend the night.  They find a wedding barn and rent it for $3,000.  They find the wedding coordinator and have a one-year wedding plan.  They hold three bachelor/bachelorette parties at the barn.  It costs $1,500 for the three gatherings.  They hold a rehearsal dinner in the barn.  It takes $200 to rent the hall.  They can use extra money to hire a band. The reception takes $100. They have a catering vendor donate $1,000 to the wedding.  They pay $500 for the reception food and $500 for music.  They buy a DJ for the wedding reception.  A group of friends and family attend the reception.  The rental money from the wedding barn helps them to pay expenses from the wedding for the next two years.  The barn rents out for $400 a week. A small ceremony costs $200.  The wedding lasts three days, one lasting seven hours each day.  Their wedding costs $10,000.  That amount covers most of their wedding expenses, so the debt is paid off in twelve months.  They use the leftover wedding expenses to help with their three-year retirement plan that is based on the amount they saved.  Their wedding costs them $1 million.  They use the remaining wedding expenses for their retirement.  The debt they incur from using the barn to pay off their wedding is paid off in twelve years.<n><n>Output: (1) or (2) (3) (4) (5)<n><n>Input : John's first job consisted of filling out a job application.

All three of them knew exactly where they were but they knew they would not be able to do anything about it as the ship was close, nearly on top of them. The engines roared just long enough that they were almost lifted high into the atmosphere where the pressure was considerably less. The ship did not lift them to great heights because every rocket took up some fuel and it could not last forever. Then, it seemed that a thin cloud came in, filling the cockpit and the view quickly became blocked. The pilot, William R. Branscum began to speak and the three of them heard him say, 'We're running out of fuel. If we use all of our reserve, the ship can't move.' Branscum then said, 'We must land.

Choices:  A: relaxation B: good things in life C: admiration D: own house E: needs money<n>Output:		 2<n><n>Input:Mary plans her summer vacation and asks her son-in-law how much she should budget.  He says that if she planned for $1,000, she probably wouldnt spend it on anything, but if she planned for $500, she would save money.  Her question:  How does $500 compare with $1,000?<n>Output: 2<n>How to answer this question?  Answer this question:  How much money would you spend that is equal to or greater than $500?<n>This question requires some thought to explain.  Think of a situation:  you know you want to start buying a new car, and you know you have money to spend.  For a given amount of money, how much of that can you spend on the car and how much of that money can you spend on something else?<n>A good example is a situation where you have $1,000 and $1,000 of savings.  Now you decide whether to spend $500 on an annual allowance for your kids, pay off your mortgage, or save your money for a car.  Each of these actions is equivalent to spending $500 of your money.  For some, you could save $1,000 instead and purchase a $15,000 car vs. the $1,000 car.  That is, if you are spending $500 on an annual income for your kids and saving $1,000, you still can save $500 and only spend $750.<n><n>This is the problem for the student:  You are given the following amount of money and you have a budget and a plan for your own money.  Yet, you get no positive results from your money.  In the video, you learn how a person can build a budget and a plan, yet still keep money in the bank with their savings account and their checking account.<n>The video also helps you understand how you might get out of the budget situation after you run off a good chunk of the money.  If you don’t like what is happening, you can put the funds you have towards the next month’s groceries.<n>If you are having a budget and a plan but you are not getting what you wanted out of the plan, you might want to change some of the things you are doing.  For example, how can you help the mom out during the summer break?  How can you spend a bit more each week on your own account to have more money for vacation

His total cost is $10 and the total cost is$70.  *C:* James owns the plane. The plane refills his tank before it runs out. He used to get $200 for each refill, but it now costs $280. He now gets $120 for each refill, or $280. He spent $20 to refill it, which means he spent $80. His total cost is now $240, or $560.  *D:* Adam has a forgiving attitude toward someone.  He forgives his friend for all his sins and all he did to hurt him. He no longer has any anger towards them for what they did, but he can't fully forgive them for the wrongs they did to him.   His forgiven friend would feel better knowing that he did not continue with what they did.

The doctor said that the prices are high and he cannot afford it.  Then he asked the salesman to buy the stuff on his behalf.  He agreed.  The doctor then had his partner call back the man. They told the salesman that he could take him to the pharmacy, and he picked up a bottle of whiskey for half the sale.  So the salesman left it there and signed the bill himself.  The doctor signed the bill and went home.  Then the doctor called the salesman and took him to a friend who had the same items. He then gave him a bottle of whiskey for $1.50.  So the doctor left it there and signed it himself.  The doctor also called the salesman back, but it was too late. The salesman already had gone to the pharmacy to buy a bottle of whiskey in the name of another customer.  So he went home after that.<n>Output: 6<n><n>Click on the number buttons under each item to see the cost per unit.  For instance, if the food was $2.00, the meat was $1.50, and the milk was $1.25, the total cost of the meal would be 49 dollars.<n><n>The cost per item is just the cost of the item itself, plus the cost of the fuel to get it to you and back.  You have a total cost here that represents the cost of a portion of a meal if you bought that product.  When the total cost gets to zero, you subtract that from the total cost, and you add your total cost to get your final cost.

Here is some advice.  The store sells $10 pizzas because they advertise that price.  But if you order an extra large pizza, you can get it for just $5.  You can also get smaller pizzas at half the price.  They are also giving away a free 12-inch pizza to the customer who gets the biggest pizza.  Here is some more information.  On Friday nights, they have their biggest party of the year, and one customer buys 100 pizzas.  A woman comes in with six people.  She buys all 100 pizzas.  So in total, she spends $600 on pizzas, but she can get them half-priced.  The store's profits are still good because they are giving away pizza for free.  The only downside, however, is that they are having the biggest sale of the year, and their profits are also going up.  They have also cut prices on their regular pizzas.  But on Saturday nights, customers only buy about a third of the pizzas because they only buy about 100.  But on Sunday nights, they buy all the pizzas.  The store has their biggest sales because they are giving one pizza away for free on Friday nights and other pizzas away on other nights.  The customers are also spending less time at the store because they also buy the larger pizzas.  And the managers are making more money because they are having their biggest sale of the year.<n><n>Output: 50<n><n>Input: A few boys want to have a party at their house.

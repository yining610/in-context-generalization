{"text": "3\n\nI'm surprised when I find people in /r/baking who know very little about statistics.\n\nI really, really don't want to look too far into the numbers on the two questions above. I don't really know anything about the math in general - I don't know anything really about the answer to either of those questions. I think that I'll be using the following explanation of this question:\n\nSuppose that you purchased 3kg of nuts and 2.53 kg of dried fruit. You used an average of $2.50 per kg of nuts and $6 for each kg of dried fruit used. The cost of each kilogram of nuts multiplied by the average of the prices of the nuts and fruits you used would be $12.50. That makes $52.50 (twice the price, so $48 before tax) for the three items.\n\nThe percentage difference between \"the three items\" and their overall sales amount is about 28%. Since we want to count the total amount of the three items, that's an average \"profit\" of 14%. Therefore, the total cost of $52.50 divided by $58.50 gives $36.50 profit ($42.50 after tax). Therefore, the answer to question 1 would be 58.50 x 28% = $42.50 per kilogram of nuts.\n\nFor the other question, you can use the following formula:\n\n(Cost per kilogram of nuts: $1.75 per kilogram of dried fruit: $1.47 per kilogram of processed fruit) * (Cost per kilogram of fruit) * (Cost of fruits) = ($2.50 * 15%) * (40% discount off the price of fruits and nuts = $1.07 per kilogram). * (Cost of fruits per kilogram)^100 = (Cost of nuts per kilogram) multiplied by 100 times.\nSo I think that the answer to question 1 (if there is one- I have no idea) should be something like:\n\n$1.50  * (Cost of nuts)  * 15% ($2.50  * 15% - 2.23% = 12.50)  * $0.50 x 15%  = $0.50 profit ($0.47 * 15% - 2% = $7.50)", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

What does he have to pay the government office?\nOutput: 5\n{The student writes up an answer. (I have him write the answer here, and you write up your answer here) I'll leave comments if you want me to. I'm going to add the text from the student's answer here as well}\nAnswer: {The student answers is wrong here.  The correct answer is ____ hours.  Here is the answer from the student's answer.}  The answer he wrote was also wrong...He forgot to mark the hours that he spent at the gym and at the farmer's fields. If you look at the answer above, you can see that James spends about 6 hours on the farm. He spends more than 6 hours at the gym, however, and his answers is wrong. He also misses out on spending time at the Farmer's fields since he isn't the one who filled the urn.  You should see that he spends more than 10 hours at the gym in his answer.}  Now if you look at his answers, the answers is wrong.  Remember that a farmer cannot hold water, diamonds, and pearl so, James only has one of them; the gold in the urn.  So he should be paid 10 hours for the time he spent at the gym.  Yours is wrong but I just realized that you wrote it up incorrectly in the first place.  If you want, you can edit your answers into your text.  It does not have to be the correct answer.  I mean, if it is, that's fine, it just needs to be the correct answer here.}  James wrote the correct answers here.  He was supposed to write five correct answers and five incorrect answers.  Remember that five is the largest number, so if you wrote 10, you will have written ten answers.  What you did was a good strategy (it is) but you didn't leave enough time for the student to get them all correct.  If you don't want to take this point into consideration, feel free to edit the answer in your text.  And don't forget to give the correct answer here.

One egg costs about $1 on each sale  However, it was once an item in the food section that cost $25 for 1 egg. Now, it costs $50 and it is now in the food section again.

The Palace is a beautiful home but it was not his dream after all, he wanted a life with no job, no responsibilities, no bills, just relaxing and having fun.   4) men's room.

They thought twice about it because they felt it would have been more expensive but in reality the man's room was smaller than Adam's regular size.   5) D.  They did not want to spend more money but that is not a major factor.

All comments must be relevant and must be legible.\n\nComments\n\nIncorrect Answer\n\nThe question does not make any sense. The question is asking too much.\nTo ask the population at large, it should be asking \"How much did you spend last month?\" or something of similar logic (If no one in the at large population spent more than you, then you spent less than they did).\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nThere is no correct answer. Each person's net income would be different based on how much they earn, how much they spend, how much they save and how much they reinvest.\n\nFeedback\nI found this question really hard to answer but there wasn't much else I could do.\n\nComments\nThere would be few people who would answer these questions if not for the fact that you could pay less based on how much you earn. With an average income of $35K a year, you could spend $2400-2700 on cigarettes per month as a smoker. By going below $1800, you will save $200 or more a month. If you earn $35K a year and spend $4000 a month, you could spend $1500, $2000, or even $3000 on cigarettes. In this case, you will need to save $1200-$2500 to be able to spend less on cigarettes (or just save more).\n\nCorrect Answer", "answer": "E: mail box"}

{"text": "12\n\nThe Answer: 1) The dog from the animal shelter will die soon due to the heat and humidity.2) There are no stray dogs available here.3) John's dog is a miniature schnauzer.  While it is true that he has a large amount of food to feed his dog, so much that 2.5 kilograms of food costs over $20 each day.4) The cost of the dog show ticket for the shelter was $25.  It was likely that this amount of money was already spent before John chose to buy a dog from there.5) The only option for John is going to the park to purchase a dog to care for.  The dog will not be a large breed but will live out his life at home.6) The cost of keeping his dog at home is less than the cost of purchasing a dog from the park.7) A dog show ticket is only $10 and the dog is also well behaved.8) The amount John spent on his dog is over half of what he spends on food each week.9)John's time is better used at the park, where he can walk his dog for an hour between food.10) The money put forth into the animal shelter by the user (purchase of the dog) pays for the veterinarian bills that the dog receives from the pet shop.\n\n### Questions Two and Three:\n\n### Answer:1)The time lost in the park is not worth the money spent on the dog show ticket.2)While the average person may pay a small amount of money to buy food, most pet food costs less than $5 per bag. Therefore, it would be reasonable, and not a waste of time, to spend his money on food instead of a dog.3) The pet shop is also offering free food to all rescue/homeless pets who come in and pay for things. It is a great way to give away food to animals that would otherwise not have it.4)The food costs can be paid with the money saved from not purchasing a dog at the pet store.5)The food will likely end up costing less than $5 per meal, at the most.6)John did not care about the fact that a dog cost $40.

With cereal, there's plenty of milk, so you don't need any other extras. After all, you only need 2 tablespoons (8 ounce) for a bowlful. So, you only need 2 full tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon for a little bowlful.\n2 tablespoons:  2 ounces = 12 to 13 tablespoons. 5 tablespoons:  5-6 ounces = 11 to 13 teaspoons. 12-13 whole ounces:  12-13 tablespoons.

C: How many people will die as a result of a volcanic eruption? D: How many minutes of television will we watch tonight? E: How many years will Adam have to keep his name on the team for?\nOutput: A\n\nI agree that this is an interesting question. What I believe I can say is that:\nIt probably has something to do with how many dollars of money he spent in the store. That is, the money comes out of his wallet, so he paid twice the amount of money.\n\nHowever, one should bear in mind that a lot of businesses have lower prices for items that are more important. A good restaurant could cut their prices lower to attract more customers. This may or may not be a good thing, who knows?\n\nAlso, one should keep in mind one's situation and the context in which one views the situation. For example, my situation is that I can only shop online, so I cannot do things like the \"buy a kilogram of nuts and spend $1\" question, due to my purchasing habits (and I should point out that buying nuts and doing cardio would probably be less harmful than simply buying a kilogram of nuts).\n\nPersonally I don't really have time to think about such things, except for that I feel it is silly to have to compare apples and oranges, because apples are much more important, and oranges aren't. So I guess my choice is either B or A: I'm not too sure; I chose B based upon context.\n\nHowever, I feel like I'm missing out from A.\n\nBut then again, I am on reddit after all... so perhaps I should be more specific with my answer. If the question were about my life, I could answer it differently than I have.\n\nAlso, I'd like to add that I didn't understand the questions, and am sorry if I did not.

Capitalism is a philosophy of nothing. Neither is true. The one is the opposite of the other. So it is the real thing.\" ---- Jack Kerouac\n\n\u201cWe have the liberty to think and to speak as we please because nobody else does.\u201d---John Adams\n\nI agree with you. I think that capitalism is the opposite of Anarchism. The reason I chose capitalism is that it was invented to make a profit, to make money. It doesn't seem to be very wise to do this since it's a dangerous business. It doesn't make sense. It's like the government saying, \"Taxation is theft!\" When the people try to take away power from the government, their system will start to fall apart, and the people will find it difficult to run a government with no government anymore.\n\nWell, I believe that what the government does, whether the government is the Federal Gov. or the State gov. is more or less an intrusion in the property-rights rights of private parties. Thats what makes it theft by definition.\n\nWell, it can be argued that capitalism is the result of the natural inclinations of an Adam Smith-inspired economy. And this is not a natural system. There's not much room for a market economy. It's like saying there's not much chance that a tree grows into a giant oak.\n\nWell, if we were truly free it probably wouldn't require a capitalist economy because an Anarchist society would simply eliminate the need for anything by itself.\n\nWell, firstly, there's no such thing as a free lunch. If we were truly free an Anarchist society would never even consider anything", "answer": "D: engine"}

I was also assuming his gym time was going to be part of his overall gym and training time was not.

{"text": "A\n\nComments:This is a clever little one. In the original answer, he makes a strong case against sunniness and manhattan, however these answers seem to imply that he is saying that such situations are undesirable, which is probably not his case. The question has also got a lot of variables, so using the more simplified (?) choices should improve some of the results. He should have gone with a little more general than to a grocery store and a fallen tree though.\n\nFor his 4th answer, I think he is trying to prove another point. He says that the sun can't really kill trees, I think that he is trying to say that such areas could be more prone to be a source of diseases, so I think this would lead him to answer D. It might also seem odd to answer A when there are alternatives such as manhattan to A, however, I don't think that there is that much competition between manhattan and dung, and he should have left the first and second choices as they are, as manhattan won't affect trees.\n\nThis was a really fun question because he is trying to prove a point against suniness and manhattan, then he tries to explain why the sun didn't destroy toenails, and there are a lot of variables to consider, so I think he could have done a little better with the wording.\n\nThis question just uses a single variable, though. With just that variable and no others, it would be a pretty easy question, though I think he could do a lot better with the wording.", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

I don't know what C, D, E is. C is the correct answer. D is the correct answer and I have no explanation other than that it's an alternative answer. The dog knows the house is at the front door which might have the additional drawback of being open and visible to the neighbour. E is not possible.\n\nI'm going to try to play this out step by step. First a sentence or two about what the question is asking, then a sentence or two about the possible answers.\n\nIn the question: The dog ran to the front...\nthe dog might want to see the tree or it might want to see the house... So the dog needs to be outside to see its own house. So if I answered with D that would be false. But what I can do is either say something like \"There are no houses inside the tree\" or \"If you see no houses inside the tree you are correct\" which would be false because the dog is not on the property of another entity so it is not seeing the house. E would be the answer, simply the most obvious one.\n\nThen I think we can take two statements and choose one of them as the correct one. So what would be a possible statement? I have read a lot about this question. But I really couldn't come up with a way to make it plausible enough that I would confidently say it's the correct one. Here are some of them:\n\nYou could give him food and water and let him have a taste of what the bird is eating and decide on one of the items.

That will make it difficult to move and more likely to bark. But if there are no humans around he will bark again and the rope will be more likely to get torn.\n\nYour guess is as good as mine, because there", "answer": "E: front door"}

They\u2019d have to find another option: an out-of-town wedding venue or drive the three hours north to Nashville and spend the night.  They find a wedding barn and rent it for $3,000.  They find the wedding coordinator and have a one-year wedding plan.  They hold three bachelor/bachelorette parties at the barn.  It costs $1,500 for the three gatherings.  They hold a rehearsal dinner in the barn.  It takes $200 to rent the hall.  They can use extra money to hire a band. The reception takes $100. They have a catering vendor donate $1,000 to the wedding.  They pay $500 for the reception food and $500 for music.  They buy a DJ for the wedding reception.  A group of friends and family attend the reception.  The rental money from the wedding barn helps them to pay expenses from the wedding for the next two years.  The barn rents out for $400 a week. A small ceremony costs $200.  The wedding lasts three days, one lasting seven hours each day.  Their wedding costs $10,000.

The engines roared just long enough that they were almost lifted high into the atmosphere where the pressure was considerably less. The ship did not lift them to great heights because every rocket took up some fuel and it could not last forever. Then, it seemed that a thin cloud came in, filling the cockpit and the view quickly became blocked. The pilot, William R. Branscum began to speak and the three of them heard him say, 'We're running out of fuel. If we use all of our reserve, the ship can't move.' Branscum then said, 'We must land.

He says that if she planned for $1,000, she probably wouldnt spend it on anything, but if she planned for $500, she would save money.  Her question:  How does $500 compare with $1,000?\nOutput: 2\nHow to answer this question?  Answer this question:  How much money would you spend that is equal to or greater than $500?\nThis question requires some thought to explain.  Think of a situation:  you know you want to start buying a new car, and you know you have money to spend.  For a given amount of money, how much of that can you spend on the car and how much of that money can you spend on something else?\nA good example is a situation where you have $1,000 and $1,000 of savings.  Now you decide whether to spend $500 on an annual allowance for your kids, pay off your mortgage, or save your money for a car.  Each of these actions is equivalent to spending $500 of your money.  For some, you could save $1,000 instead and purchase a $15,000 car vs. the $1,000 car.  That is, if you are spending $500 on an annual income for your kids and saving $1,000, you still can save $500 and only spend $750.\n\nThis is the problem for the student:  You are given the following amount of money and you have a budget and a plan for your own money.  Yet, you get no positive results from your money.  In the video, you learn how a person can build a budget and a plan, yet still keep money in the bank with their savings account and their checking account.\nThe video also helps you understand how you might get out of the budget situation after you run off a good chunk of the money.  If you don\u2019t like what is happening, you can put the funds you have towards the next month\u2019s groceries.\nIf you are having a budget and a plan but you are not getting what you wanted out of the plan, you might want to change some of the things you are doing.  For example, how can you help the mom out during the summer break?  How can you spend a bit more each week on your own account to have more money for vacation", "answer": "A: relaxation"}

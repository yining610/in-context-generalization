The boy and his brother decided to get her a pair of shoes. The mother came to the front counter and gave her son two big presents:\n\n\u201cI got you two shoes. You can wear your new ones right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are we supposed to put them on him?\u201d\n\n\u201dHere\u2019s a pair of shoes. But before you put them on him, I\u2019d like you to take off your shoes.\u201d\n\nThe boy said, \u201cOkay. Will you keep one pair for yourselves?\u201d\n\nThe mother said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so, dear. He\u2019s a boy.", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

This does not give Lulu a \"social character\" but rather that Lulu has low obedience and is easily frightened.\n\nSolution:\n\nThere is a problem with the question: What is the easiest thing to tell a dog apart from another?. The reason being that dogs have many physical similarities, so they are easier to look for by identifying the different body parts. The only two parts that are not closely related are head and tail.\nIt is not the easiest thing to tell the dog apart; it is just one of several parts\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the easiest way to be sure that a dog is a Doberman versus a Doberman/schnauzer? Your answer:\nThe correct answer is to know the breed. Because Doberman dogs and Schnauzer dogs have the same size ears, they are easier to tell.\n\nSolution: The problem with this question can be solved in two ways. First, there are four possible answers:\n1. A Doberman can be distinguished from a Doberman/Schnauzer because of the shape of the ears:\n\nSolution: A second way to look at this is to look at each part of the dog's body, looking for physical similarities. First there is the head. The nose, the mouth, the eye sockets are the most obvious physical differences between a Doberman and a Doberman/ Schnauzer. The head is the part you want to be 100% sure is a Doberman, because it is the point where the ears meet the head.

They like eating it, dislike eating it, dislike eating half of it, and eat part of it.\n\nQuestion 4 Answers\n\nI don't think that you should worry about people eating too many vegetables. I think it just depends on what kind of vegetables you make. Sometimes vegetables are delicious but you can eat them too much. Vegetarian people like to eat less vegetables in a day. I agree on the eating the vegetables everyday. Some people eat very few vegetables but they don't like them like you do. If you don't have many vegetables, then you should eat more vegetables.\n\nWhat kind of vegetables are vegetables that you can't tell in the cooking? Vegetables that should be grilled or cooked in the oven. You can boil, saute, steam, bake, blanch, grill, roast, cook and so on. Vegetables that should be cooked in the oven or cooked are vegetables: broccoli, cabbage, peppers, cucumber, tomatoes, asparagus, beans, green peas, cauliflower, yams, sweet potatoes, carrots, zucchini, turnips, turnip greens, turnips. You can boil in water for about 20 minutes, cook in oil, fry in oil or vegetable oil, steam, saute, marinate and many more. Of course you can use a vegetable peeler to peel your vegetables but it's really important not to peel the vegetables. If your parents used vegetables in a salad, then you should peel them but not for any salad but for the salad. If you eat raw vegetables, then you should peel your vegetables.\n\nIf you are the vegetarian type of person then you need to eat your vegetables at a certain time so that you can maintain that condition for a whole life. Vegetarian should eat a lot of vegetables all of a sudden. They should eat vegetables as the main meal or just a snack and they do not have to make them to eat vegetables everyday. Vegetarian don't have to be in the condition that all of the time", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

Output: self preservation; A: empathy; B: survival; C: learning,  D:  self-awareness;\nOutput: A, B, C and D are all correct answers\n\nResponse\n\n1. A : Learning\n\nThe social world is a human brain's own way of surviving. An individual's survival depends partly on the ability to understand how other people function, to be able to read other people's emotions and to understand their motives. To achieve this the brain requires information from the social world (see: \"Intelligent behavior in social animals\" by B. Leicht and R. Bienvenu, Nature 360, 12-15, 1987). Since the social world includes the entire life cycle of the animal, and since we humans use it to survive ourselves, learning is the most important part of the brain's use of the social world. The social world also allows us to form stable relationships with others, so that humans can survive and even procreate.\n\nThe social world also serves to help us learn new skills and techniques, since a person learns to be more efficient and competitive in group work, in order to keep up with his (or her) group. Social skills also help us to solve problems, since the brain requires information that the social world supplies.\n\n2.C and D are also correct answers with the same response.\n\n3.A: What would you say is the best way to learn a new skill?\n\nThe brain uses an extensive set of skills", "answer": "A: learning"}

If the population divided by three is three times the population of the United States then the population of each state is .  If the population of each state divided by four is three times the population, then the population of each U.S. state is.\n\n This method of dividing is incorrect.  If more than three people divide by three the population of each state must be. Note that since population divided by three is less than population divided by four each state will have exactly, since population divided by four is less than population divided three. As the president, the head of the state and the vice president agree to disagree the population of each state does not equal 3.8 and therefore does not divide by three because at least 3.8 does not divide by three nor does it divide by four.\n\n This method of dividing must be correct because it is not a simple division as stated above, however, since all three are more than 3 people the population must be three times the population divided by three. Since they are more than three people they would divide by three. Using the population divide by three to determine population divided by three they divide by three and divide by 4.

My teacher said that usually this happens because I\u2019m inhaling and exhaling too fast. What do you think?\u201d\nOutput: I said that if you listen carefully, you\u2019ll discover that in your voice is a little \u201crumblin\u201d sound. I said if you could be in three places at once, you would be in a hurry.\n\nAnswer:In the past two minutes, at a rate of one minute a day, our bodies consume 200 g of water, the required quantity for survival. At the same rate, we would consume 300 g of food. So the question becomes: What happens with our body water storage levels after the food we eat is finished?  Answer: Your body stores these levels, along with any excess body fat, as water.\n\nInput: a student asks, \u201chow do I know my pulse when I\u2019m in a hurry?\u201d\nOutput : I said that I will measure the pulse, and compare it with your pulse, to see if your pulse seems slower when you\u2019re in a hurry! My next question was, \u201cwell, which pulse will be faster? The one you\u2019re in or the one you\u2019re about to be out of?\u201d\n\nAnswer:The pulse rate, which is a measure of how fast your heart is beating, measures the amount of blood that travels in your arteries and veins. It makes up 50 percent of the blood in your body. The blood flow rate, which is the percentage of blood in your body that flows out of your arteries and veins, is the other half.  When your blood flow rate goes down, your pulse rate goes up, and vice versa. It doesn\u2019t matter what your pulse rate is. If you feel like your heart rate is normal and your blood flow is normal, your pulse rate will stay normal on its own. Your heart rate can become slightly slower if you smoke, or if you don\u2019t make an effort to keep it up, because the extra blood flow can reduce your blood flow rate.", "answer": "B: oxygen"}

A:B:E: output: 50\n\nInput/Solution: The only method of transportation used by the tribe in which they could avoid predators was horseback riding. Why do you think that this is the case?\nOutput: 50\nThe most common way of crossing rivers is with large rafts, built with trees or logs from surrounding areas, which they can haul across the water. The water, of course, is extremely choppy, but they can avoid the choppy water by moving slowly and avoiding turns. Horseback riding is also a more environmentally friendly way of crossing this waterway.\nThe tribe\u2019s use of natural methods for transportation is not unusual. Over millions of years, our bodies have evolved in such a way that we are able to use the best natural means of moving about. We are so used to moving that we hardly notice when we don\u2019t have access to vehicles or walking ways.\nSince the animals in our story lived in relative isolation from each other, they needed vehicles in order to avoid predators and other animals. Horseback riding was also an effective, cheap and fast method that kept the animals safe when they could not cross a large body of water.\nHorseback riding is also similar to horse-drawn carriages. Both animals and humans use these vehicles for traveling to remote areas and exploring parts of the world. Although the transportation of both animals and humans is similar, the vehicles used for the transport are vastly different. Horseback riding is an inexpensive, quick and easy form of transportation while horse drawn cars are slower and more expensive and often have much worse fuel economy.\nNatural methods aren\u2019t always the most efficient forms of transportation. Some animals have adapted to using their natural abilities and therefore require a different form of transportation from others animals. Animal adapted technologies, such as horse-drawn carriages or horseback riding are more appropriate for long distance travel.\nNatural methods that are used by some animals are not readily available to many others.

Both cylinders are connected, one to the engine crank and the other to the crankshaft. Now a new cylinder enters the engine, displaces the air in the cylinders, and gives the new cylinder an extra stroke. All new cylinders are connected by springs to the engine crank and crankshaft. All cylinders are connected to the crankshafts except the one with a new stroke which is connected by a chain to the engine's drive wheels with the chain linking the chain to the crankshafter. The engine has an output gear and an input gear. To run the engine, the chain is pulled through the input gear so it pushes the output gear, which in turn pushes the input gear so that the output is rotated. Two wheels of the engine are driven by the engine's drive wheels. The crank runs on the top of a shaft that passes through the engine's crank pinion and the cylinder heads and the front of the car. The crank pinion is mounted on the front of the engine by its crank pin. The engine has a three-hole pinion. First, the pinion passes through the crankshaft's top hole. Later, the pinion passes over the two crank pins so that it may also be mounted in the three-hole pinion's hole.  The crank pinion's shaft runs through the front of the engine, passing under the left engine cylinder. It runs down the shaft to the right of the front of the engine and then down again to the left of the front of the car's left engine cylinder. When the three-hole pinioned crankshafter passes beneath the right engine cylinder, a chain driven by a chain driven by a belt reaches around it and connects that cylinder to the three-hole pinION.

This is true for all activities.\n### Instruction:Write your answer in the box below.\n\n### Response:\n\nAnswer:The people will generally take a person who they know will win because they know that he or she will do better than a person who they know that they usually lose to. Also, there is a psychological reason that may come into play when people compete with one another. When people compete with one another, they will generally make a bet on the winner. However, some people would only compete with each other in a sporting event or contest if they were close in skill, intelligence or ability. When a skilled person competes, they may make a bet that can be as high as thirty percent to one hundred percent of the amount they will pay for the loser's toothbrush. Also, there is an incentive for a winner to lose if there is no real threat of losing. For instance, if a person believes that there is a good chance that he or she will win the bet. They may be prepared to pay a lot of money for the loser's toothbrushes, to be sure that he or she will loose.\n\n#### Discussion:\n\n1. What is an edge?\n2. What is a competitor?\n3.

{"text": "32\n\nInput:What do you see the difference between a regular and a semi-regular job? Choice: A: Regular Job: Regular jobs are only at a job for about 4 weeks, and require you to return to it for 3 of those weeks each year.  Semi-regular JOB: A semi-regular job is usually an hourly or bi-hourly position.  Semi-regular jobs are usually better because you can spend 1 hour at your full-time job and 1 at your semi-regular one.  Semi-regularities pay better because they don\u2019t have as high turnover as regular job job.  There are 3 types of semi-regular jobs: (1) a job that is at least 30% full-time,  (2) a job that is 40-60% full-time, and (3) an open job that doesn\u2019t have many applicants.  Open jobs are more stressful, but it pays better and it lets you make more money.  Your semi-regular job pays better and you can make better money, but you might quit the other job at 3 weeks.  It\u2019s not like full-time jobs, where you stay with a full-time job unless you choose to resign, so this is more like a part-time job.  Semi-regular positions have 1-3 hours of work.  Regular job jobs have 4-6 hours of work, so they are more stressful.  Semi-regular full-time jobs are typically 3 hours.  There are several kinds of semi-regular jobs for any business.\nOutput: 4\n\nInput:What is the difference between regular and semi-regular jobs?

The woman wants as much head as they possibly can, so there is a risk that another woman may want in as well. The male has a need to protect his health and so tries to avoid going down on a woman. When a woman gets down on a man, the man's most important goal is to make his dick look huge when he does it. If there are two women, one man tries to do the same in both girls at the same time.

Pascual concluded that God was the creator of things in all places, by all times. He considered all things good.  God has a divine character and has no evil actions or feelings.  God is the good in all beings. He created all things in his image. A divine object does not need to do evil to be divine.  God is the author of creation and is omnipresent and invisible. He is transcendent and without beginning or end.  A non-divine divine object is not good.  Non-divine is not good. God is both good and evil, but not all good.  The God of the Bible is the opposite of Pascual.  God made all things evil. God created evil. God created all things good, but non-good.  God is both good and bad, and good and evil.  The world is suffering because of God because God created evil and created good.  This universe is suffering because of God's actions on earth.  This universe did not exist before God created it. Good is non-evil and evil is non-good and non-divine.  God created the world, and thus became the cause of the world's suffering.\n\nPascal'sWisdom\n\nIf God created a world that was suffering,\nand also created that world by giving it a beginning,\n\nthen if the universe contains the beginning,\nthen there must be a God who created it.\nThis must be a God who exists, and not at all some of the\nsame being as has created before.\n\nThis must be a true God, and not someone who\nhas been or has become evil.\n\nTherefore, God is the only true God,\nsince he was the creator who does not exist in\nthem.\n\nIf this being were to exist, since he is", "answer": "B: heretical"}

You feel very excited about the possibilities that the new shoes will have in terms of improving your workouts. As the first shoe of your new shoes goes on, you put your left foot on the first step of the small incline in the basement and your right leg and forearm are supported at the midpoint of the little ledge as you proceed up the small incline towards the second step. You are surprised to feel a sudden jerk as your left knee is pushed forward. After that jerk, your next movement is to bring your weight and body into one motion while still putting your left foot with your left foot on the start of the next stair or step. The jerk and the push forward are similar to the feeling you have while getting out of bed in the morning and pressing your right foot down on the floor with the right foot toward the ground. It is similar, in fact, to what you can experience when you are walking downstairs to your car in the morning. When you are on your way up the stairs, however, it feels different because the upward movement is less. You take another step and notice something. The bottom tread of your shoe appears to be about 2 inches below the ground. As much as you want to believe it is just that one misaligned step or misaligned stair that caused the jerk or push forward, you know that is not possible. It causes a jerk or push-forward movement.

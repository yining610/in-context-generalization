I think it just depends on what kind of vegetables you make. Sometimes vegetables are delicious but you can eat them too much. Vegetarian people like to eat less vegetables in a day. I agree on the eating the vegetables everyday. Some people eat very few vegetables but they don't like them like you do. If you don't have many vegetables, then you should eat more vegetables.<n><n>What kind of vegetables are vegetables that you can't tell in the cooking? Vegetables that should be grilled or cooked in the oven. You can boil, saute, steam, bake, blanch, grill, roast, cook and so on. Vegetables that should be cooked in the oven or cooked are vegetables: broccoli, cabbage, peppers, cucumber, tomatoes, asparagus, beans, green peas, cauliflower, yams, sweet potatoes, carrots, zucchini, turnips, turnip greens, turnips. You can boil in water for about 20 minutes, cook in oil, fry in oil or vegetable oil, steam, saute, marinate and many more. Of course you can use a vegetable peeler to peel your vegetables but it's really important not to peel the vegetables. If your parents used vegetables in a salad, then you should peel them but not for any salad but for the salad. If you eat raw vegetables, then you should peel your vegetables.<n><n>If you are the vegetarian type of person then you need to eat your vegetables at a certain time so that you can maintain that condition for a whole life. Vegetarian should eat a lot of vegetables all of a sudden. They should eat vegetables as the main meal or just a snack and they do not have to make them to eat vegetables everyday. Vegetarian don't have to be in the condition that all of the time

A : Learning<n><n>The social world is a human brain's own way of surviving. An individual's survival depends partly on the ability to understand how other people function, to be able to read other people's emotions and to understand their motives. To achieve this the brain requires information from the social world (see: "Intelligent behavior in social animals" by B. Leicht and R. Bienvenu, Nature 360, 12-15, 1987). Since the social world includes the entire life cycle of the animal, and since we humans use it to survive ourselves, learning is the most important part of the brain's use of the social world. The social world also allows us to form stable relationships with others, so that humans can survive and even procreate.<n><n>The social world also serves to help us learn new skills and techniques, since a person learns to be more efficient and competitive in group work, in order to keep up with his (or her) group. Social skills also help us to solve problems, since the brain requires information that the social world supplies.<n><n>2.C and D are also correct answers with the same response.<n><n>3.A: What would you say is the best way to learn a new skill?<n><n>The brain uses an extensive set of skills

If the population divided by three is three times the population of the United States then the population of each state is .  If the population of each state divided by four is three times the population, then the population of each U.S. state is.<n><n> This method of dividing is incorrect.  If more than three people divide by three the population of each state must be. Note that since population divided by three is less than population divided by four each state will have exactly, since population divided by four is less than population divided three. As the president, the head of the state and the vice president agree to disagree the population of each state does not equal 3.8 and therefore does not divide by three because at least 3.8 does not divide by three nor does it divide by four.<n><n> This method of dividing must be correct because it is not a simple division as stated above, however, since all three are more than 3 people the population must be three times the population divided by three.

Choices:  A: action B: demonstration C: understanding D: vote E: revolution<n>Output:		 D<n><n>There is an African dictator that has a policy called Total War and his primary weapon is the BBI, (Benevolent Communist Influence), which is a machine gun with a tube and arm that is designed to shoot a blast of deadly poison smoke.  He uses his BBI to destroy every other country in Africa, leaving only Rwanda to live.  There are five million African's in Rwanda including 100,000 United Nations Peacekeepers.  There are also 300,000 American Citizens in Rwanda, but the BBI policy will not allow them to come without proper clearance.  In the end the BBI gun is completely useless and Rwanda falls in a single day.   It is a very strange war and not the way most wars in Africa are fought.  The dictator is removed by UN forces.<n>The BBI is a very confusing weapon and very much liked by all of his citizens because it seems harmless.  The BBI is only a small part of the total war and there are much bigger problems. The BBI is not used for defense because if he ever uses it, it would be considered inhumane.  The BBI gun would be used only by a dictator who is only interested in his own country and not for the defense of the world.

My teacher said that usually this happens because I’m inhaling and exhaling too fast. What do you think?”<n>Output: I said that if you listen carefully, you’ll discover that in your voice is a little “rumblin” sound. I said if you could be in three places at once, you would be in a hurry.<n><n>Answer:In the past two minutes, at a rate of one minute a day, our bodies consume 200 g of water, the required quantity for survival. At the same rate, we would consume 300 g of food. So the question becomes: What happens with our body water storage levels after the food we eat is finished?  Answer: Your body stores these levels, along with any excess body fat, as water.<n><n>Input: a student asks, “how do I know my pulse when I’m in a hurry?”<n>Output : I said that I will measure the pulse, and compare it with your pulse, to see if your pulse seems slower when you’re in a hurry! My next question was, “well, which pulse will be faster? The one you’re in or the one you’re about to be out of?”<n><n>Answer:The pulse rate, which is a measure of how fast your heart is beating, measures the amount of blood that travels in your arteries and veins. It makes up 50 percent of the blood in your body. The blood flow rate, which is the percentage of blood in your body that flows out of your arteries and veins, is the other half.  When your blood flow rate goes down, your pulse rate goes up, and vice versa. It doesn’t matter what your pulse rate is. If you feel like your heart rate is normal and your blood flow is normal, your pulse rate will stay normal on its own. Your heart rate can become slightly slower if you smoke, or if you don’t make an effort to keep it up, because the extra blood flow can reduce your blood flow rate.

When the humans left for work in the morning, they'd lock their doors and windows so that their children wouldn't get out.    A:B:E: output: 50<n><n>Input/Solution: The only method of transportation used by the tribe in which they could avoid predators was horseback riding. Why do you think that this is the case?<n>Output: 50<n>The most common way of crossing rivers is with large rafts, built with trees or logs from surrounding areas, which they can haul across the water. The water, of course, is extremely choppy, but they can avoid the choppy water by moving slowly and avoiding turns. Horseback riding is also a more environmentally friendly way of crossing this waterway.<n>The tribe’s use of natural methods for transportation is not unusual. Over millions of years, our bodies have evolved in such a way that we are able to use the best natural means of moving about. We are so used to moving that we hardly notice when we don’t have access to vehicles or walking ways.<n>Since the animals in our story lived in relative isolation from each other, they needed vehicles in order to avoid predators and other animals. Horseback riding was also an effective, cheap and fast method that kept the animals safe when they could not cross a large body of water.<n>Horseback riding is also similar to horse-drawn carriages. Both animals and humans use these vehicles for traveling to remote areas and exploring parts of the world. Although the transportation of both animals and humans is similar, the vehicles used for the transport are vastly different. Horseback riding is an inexpensive, quick and easy form of transportation while horse drawn cars are slower and more expensive and often have much worse fuel economy.<n>Natural methods aren’t always the most efficient forms of transportation. Some animals have adapted to using their natural abilities and therefore require a different form of transportation from others animals. Animal adapted technologies, such as horse-drawn carriages or horseback riding are more appropriate for long distance travel.<n>Natural methods that are used by some animals are not readily available to many others. Most of the

Both cylinders are connected, one to the engine crank and the other to the crankshaft. Now a new cylinder enters the engine, displaces the air in the cylinders, and gives the new cylinder an extra stroke. All new cylinders are connected by springs to the engine crank and crankshaft. All cylinders are connected to the crankshafts except the one with a new stroke which is connected by a chain to the engine's drive wheels with the chain linking the chain to the crankshafter. The engine has an output gear and an input gear. To run the engine, the chain is pulled through the input gear so it pushes the output gear, which in turn pushes the input gear so that the output is rotated. Two wheels of the engine are driven by the engine's drive wheels. The crank runs on the top of a shaft that passes through the engine's crank pinion and the cylinder heads and the front of the car. The crank pinion is mounted on the front of the engine by its crank pin. The engine has a three-hole pinion. First, the pinion passes through the crankshaft's top hole. Later, the pinion passes over the two crank pins so that it may also be mounted in the three-hole pinion's hole.  The crank pinion's shaft runs through the front of the engine, passing under the left engine cylinder. It runs down the shaft to the right of the front of the engine and then down again to the left of the front of the car's left engine cylinder. When the three-hole pinioned crankshafter passes beneath the right engine cylinder, a chain driven by a chain driven by a belt reaches around it and connects that cylinder to the three-hole pinION. The chain turns a crank pinion that

This is true for all activities.<n>### Instruction:Write your answer in the box below.<n><n>### Response:<n><n>Answer:The people will generally take a person who they know will win because they know that he or she will do better than a person who they know that they usually lose to. Also, there is a psychological reason that may come into play when people compete with one another. When people compete with one another, they will generally make a bet on the winner. However, some people would only compete with each other in a sporting event or contest if they were close in skill, intelligence or ability. When a skilled person competes, they may make a bet that can be as high as thirty percent to one hundred percent of the amount they will pay for the loser's toothbrush. Also, there is an incentive for a winner to lose if there is no real threat of losing. For instance, if a person believes that there is a good chance that he or she will win the bet. They may be prepared to pay a lot of money for the loser's toothbrushes, to be sure that he or she will loose.<n><n>#### Discussion:<n><n>1. What is an edge?<n>2. What is a competitor?<n>3.

The first time someone said that "everyone knew" about the Doberman, I think every dog owner would have said, "Yup! I've been knowing about the Doberman for years! It's my dog! I think he's smart and handsome, and he's part of the family!"  2. Which answer explains the last part of your answer about the two students exchanging glances?  3.  According to the second question of your answer, the two students were exchanging glances because they thought the teacher's seat was shared, but wasn't.  4.  Which question explained what happened next?  5.  The third question is correct, because while the students may have looked at each other, it sounded a lot scarier to say "I think you're a bad kid!" rather than "I think you're smart!" because "smart" is more scary than "bad."  6. The fourth question gives me a bit of trouble.  How would I answer the answer about "ultimatums"?  I don't know if you want to look at my responses to previous questions to see which ones I would choose, since I don't have to grade homework this test, but I think you can find an easier way (for example, by simply looking at my first choice answers.

He prescribed three doses of ibuprofen to help loosen up the kid's muscles. In August the child was back at the doctor and was suffering from pain all over. He was suffering from joint pain, fatigue, vomiting and headaches. The doctor gave him two more doses of ibuproenfen. In October he was complaining of pain. In November he was still suffering. He decided to try something unexpected. He prescribed two more doses of ibu, followed by a third dose in December. The child seemed to be okay, and started to feel better. When he saw the doctor early January, the child had not yet showed any of the effects. He was feverish and had difficulty swallowing, but the doctor assumed that the fever was due to the cold winter weather. He gave the child a fourth dose of ibuprofen on January 7. After that another round of ibuprofen was given. Still the child was not feeling well. So on January 12 the child was given a fifth dose of ibuproenen. The child showed no sign of improvement. The doctor was worried and thought that there was a possibility that the fever could turn fatal. So he decided that two more doses of ibubuprofen were unnecessary—just in case. The doctor gave the child another dose of ibuprofin and then returned him to his room so that he could rest. Then he gave the child three more ibuprofin doses, followed by one more dose of ibuprof, and one more dose of ibuanaphen in the child's throat. The seventh day the child started to feel better, and the doctor asked if he wanted another dose of ibuprogen. The child refused. So the doctor gave the child a final dose of ibuprogene. The child was still not feeling well, and the doctor decided that three more doses of ibupregene would definitely be unnecessary. The temperature remained high however, and the doctor decided to stop giving the children ibuprofen and ibuprofen. And so, four days after getting off the drugs, the child died. What did the doctor and the child do wrong? Did their actions deserve what happened to them? How did they make the wrong decisions that led to their deaths? What was done to prevent a similar situation?<n>Input: How many of the children given the ibuprofen and the

Choice: A: Regular Job: Regular jobs are only at a job for about 4 weeks, and require you to return to it for 3 of those weeks each year.  Semi-regular JOB: A semi-regular job is usually an hourly or bi-hourly position.  Semi-regular jobs are usually better because you can spend 1 hour at your full-time job and 1 at your semi-regular one.  Semi-regularities pay better because they don’t have as high turnover as regular job job.  There are 3 types of semi-regular jobs: (1) a job that is at least 30% full-time,  (2) a job that is 40-60% full-time, and (3) an open job that doesn’t have many applicants.  Open jobs are more stressful, but it pays better and it lets you make more money.  Your semi-regular job pays better and you can make better money, but you might quit the other job at 3 weeks.  It’s not like full-time jobs, where you stay with a full-time job unless you choose to resign, so this is more like a part-time job.  Semi-regular positions have 1-3 hours of work.  Regular job jobs have 4-6 hours of work, so they are more stressful.  Semi-regular full-time jobs are typically 3 hours.  There are several kinds of semi-regular jobs for any business.<n>Output: 4<n><n>Input:What is the difference between regular and semi-regular jobs? Choice: Regular Jobs: Regular jobs have the exact same hours, but they usually only pay for 60 hours a month.  Semi-regular Jobs: Semi-regular jobs have the exact same amount of work as regular jobs, but usually pay for less than 60 hours a month.<n>Output: 5<n><n>Input:Mr. Rogers was an insurance salesman for his last 9 years doing a semi-regular job.

C:  he needed a break from traveling.  D:  he needed to spend more quality time with his family during the week.<n>Output: 5

In order for the restaurant to make sufficient profit to pay for both employees, how many customers will be needed?<n>Output: 55.<n><n>Input:Stan had a dream that he was very very hungry. He thought the whole house was empty except for his wife. He looked everywhere but just couldn’t find her. Then he found her in the other room of the house. Stanley was about to eat when the phone rang. Stan ran to the phone and quickly answered it – the caller then asked “do you want $10.00.” Stan said sure, but he couldn’t take food from his wife. The caller then asked what he would pay if he could give the money back at any time.  Stanley was terrified and said “I’d pay you my life savings.”  The caller replied “That much money….?”  Stan said no, I meant my life’s savings. The caller finally hung up on him.    Stan went straight over to his wife and immediately told her what had happened.  His wife was horrified when Stan told her.  She cried and told Stanley that he would never again have an opportunity like this from her.  She went to bed that night very worried.<n>Stan was not able to get the $10.00 back from his wife.

He started looking for another job, and he decided to apply for restaurant work. He didn’t care if the job didn’t pay as much money – he just wanted to get away from his old job.<n>He worked at the restaurant for about a month. He was having some problem with his boss, though. The manager was rude, and would not take questions from the dishwashers. He would often yell at dishwashers when they were working improperly. All he would do with the money

The woman wants as much head as they possibly can, so there is a risk that another woman may want in as well. The male has a need to protect his health and so tries to avoid going down on a woman. When a woman gets down on a man, the man's most important goal is to make his dick look huge when he does it. If there are two women, one man tries to do the same in both girls at the same time. If a man is not careful, he could end up with two dicks instead of a penis.  If there are four people, one man tries to avoid taking all of the head given to him. If one person gets too many headshots, all of the other members of the group will not be able to suck in as much.  If there are eight people and only four individuals, there is a lot of pressure to give everyone a headshot. If a man gets too many headshots from the same person, there is a chance that the man will grow to get a penis the size of his balls.<n>Output: 25<n><n>Input:What is the difference in time spent on a date by the opposite sex and by a man and a woman.

Pascual concluded that God was the creator of things in all places, by all times. He considered all things good.  God has a divine character and has no evil actions or feelings.  God is the good in all beings. He created all things in his image. A divine object does not need to do evil to be divine.  God is the author of creation and is omnipresent and invisible. He is transcendent and without beginning or end.  A non-divine divine object is not good.  Non-divine is not good. God is both good and evil, but not all good.  The God of the Bible is the opposite of Pascual.  God made all things evil. God created evil. God created all things good, but non-good.  God is both good and bad, and good and evil.  The world is suffering because of God because God created evil and created good.  This universe is suffering because of God's actions on earth.  This universe did not exist before God created it. Good is non-evil and evil is non-good and non-divine.

They must have realized that they should have pulled themselves out of the water if they were too afraid to stay in it, as the water was deep enough it took more strength than they had.  If they stayed in it, they would never have been rescued so perhaps they decided they were better off dying.<n>Output: 8<n><n>Solution:<n>Two students, who have identical bodies weighed 140 pounds when it was time they graduated from high school.

Jim said he was going for a walk to see Mary. When he came home he found Mary standing on the floor. Mary was very cold, so Jim took her to her room. Mary lay down, but Mary started shaking. Then Jim heard Mary say, “That’s the second one.“. Bob was alarmed because he thought Mary was in trouble, but then Mary started talking quickly. Jim looked out the window and saw that Mary was standing in the snow. The snow was coming up and around her legs so fast that it was a snow angel. Then Jim heard Mary talking to herself about how much pain she was in, but Joe was right there to help her. So Jim decided Mary wasn’t in any trouble either. So the three of them sat down to have a chat. As the rest of the guests began to leave, they suddenly heard shouting. As Joe went to Mary’s door, he tripped. He fell down the stairs and hit his head. Mary ran to get him help. When Jim and Joe came in after Mary they found a blood trail. They ran out into the front yard to help Jim up. He was very very dazed and confused. Mary heard all this, so she and Frank took him home. Mary got his shoes and put them on and started to walk back to her house. She heard two voices talking very loud and angry, but she didn’t want to hear what it was. She went inside. To her annoyance, just as she went into the kitchen, they were still arguing. Finally she turned and ran out of the house. As she left the house Mary saw the two men were still arguing. She stood behind them and made them stop as quietly as she can. They tried to deny everything, but Mary kept pushing. The two men turned and faced her. One of them said, “You hear that.  That was an ice pick.“ Mary heard another voice say, “We’ve got to get rid of her.“

The surgeon will need 24 stitches along with 1.5 inches of sutures. What is the total amount of stitches he will need?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:The patient is the father of a 14-year-old boy. The mother died, so the child is alone. He is very depressed about his grief and his inability to help his friend who is in serious trouble. The only thing on his mind is to sleep for as long as possible. His friend needs help because he is drowning. How can the doctor treat the problem?<n>Output: 33<n><n>Input:You are at your local gym and your trainer tells you that he has just gotten a new pair of shoes. It has the words on the heel "Corduroy" and the picture of "Lilac." You feel very confident that the shoes will be an incredible new way for you to work out. You feel very excited about the possibilities that the new shoes will have in terms of improving your workouts. As the first shoe of your new shoes goes on, you put your left foot on the first step of the small incline in the basement and your right leg and forearm are supported at the midpoint of the little ledge as you proceed up the small incline towards the second step. You are surprised to feel a sudden jerk as your left knee is pushed forward. After that jerk, your next movement is to bring your weight and body into one motion while still putting your left foot with your left foot on the start of the next stair or step. The jerk and the push forward are similar to the feeling you have while getting out of bed in the morning and pressing your right foot down on the floor with the right foot toward the ground. It is similar, in fact, to what you can experience when you are walking downstairs to your car in the morning. When you are on your way up the stairs, however, it feels different because the upward movement is less. You take another step and notice something. The bottom tread of your shoe appears to be about 2 inches below the ground. As much as you want to believe it is just that one misaligned step or misaligned stair that caused the jerk or push forward, you know that is not possible. It causes a jerk or push-forward movement. The next step for you is to try lifting your heels off the ground at the same time that you lift your right foot off of the stairs for the next stair.

If we say, "No", we make it clear that we are not accepting the question. When we are asking a direct question, we use the phrase, "Yes" or "Yes". Other than saying "No", we don't use no.<n><n>input: A is playing with scissors and cuts herself on one of her fingers.

If we take the first and second terms together, the rest of the numbers are equal to 10 because our denominator of 2x should have negative value because of one term (8 times 2+3+7=12) and 2x/9=3 times 5. Therefore there are 10. If we take the third term apart, the rest of the equations and the rest of the numbers and add them together, we find that 10(6/9)= 8. Therefore the equation is 5-2-10(2-7+9) = 1+100.<n>Output: 5-(3-10) - 10)=50 =25. So 125 = 50 - 125 = 25. So this is the number of Dobermans in the solar system.

In the year 2000, the budget surplus was $1.2 trillion.  Over $1 trillion was paid in tax cuts in the year 2000. The next time the U.S had a budget surplus was during the decade 2000-2010. In the years 2000-2002, the budget surplus was a record $1.4 trillion, and the budget surplus in the decade 2010 went to $1.5 trillion. The U.S did not have an over-budget deficit until the year 2012.  The next budget year to surpass the over-budget deficit was in 2015.  Over half of the budget deficit during the decade 2010-2015 was caused by the growth of Social Security.  The over-budget deficit is caused when the value of the US dollar depreciates.  When the value of the dollar depreciates, taxes go up causing higher taxes.  When the value does not depreciate, the value of the dollar goes up causing lower taxes.  The U.S. had an over-budget deficit during the 2010s.<n>Output (from Excel): 8<n>Answer: A

She continues to grade groups one student at a time and assigns the report to each group until each group has only one student assigned to it. The time of class for grading is determined when the teacher assigns each group to the next line of students.

At the end of the class, the teacher assigns the grade of the first four students. If the student gets a grade of \u201cB\u201d, he is then rated \u201cC\u201d. If the student gets an \u201cA\u2019, then the student is rated \u201cA\u201d for all of his report.\n\nThere is a student named Kevin who has been in a relationship since grade 7.

One of my students recently left her smartphone home and came back nearly an hour later with a text message and a picture of a text message. You may recall from our lesson today about cell phone use that most phones have text-messaging and texting capabilities. There\u2019s a way to make text messages easier to read when you can read the content of the text message and some apps that help make that easier.\n\nHowever, we talked today about cell phones and text texting and what we could do when we leave our cell phones at home. We talked about how important it is to be aware of what we are sending and getting in text messaging. The phone companies do a great job of making sure you cannot see what messages others are sending you. However, there are apps that let you see who was texting you. So as students left their smartphones home today, I asked them to write a message that included a contact number (or even a name) and a few sentences stating the purpose of the text message. I wrote the message out and asked them to share it with me. The following were some of the messages they sent me.\n\nHi, I am so sorry I didn\u2019t get back to you earlier, I had an accident with my phone at lunch and I forgot to take it. It\u2019s at my house right now or I could send you a text?\nTanya\n\nHi, I just got home from school but I have another important thing to get started on. Can I try to call you back after lunch?\nTanya\nTanya\u2019s message was just an ordinary simple text message. However, it was exactly what I expected. It was a picture of the text message she sent me. It was a normal simple text, except for one small detail. It was of the text message I sent her.\nWhat I didn\u2019t account for was that in all the text messages I sent her, I had turned my phone display on.", "answer": "D: players"}

Why would we need to buy a bigger boat to travel further and be comfortable when we reach our destination?\nOutput:\"We need to buy a bigger car.\"  The car only needs to be decent to travel across town. The car is fine at cruising, but it's not good enough to drive more than 50-100km.  The car needs to be larger than the boats in order to reach our destination.  The car already exceeds the boat limit, so if it costs more, why would we need a bigger car?  It would only get more expensive.

The first team came in first. They won the coin toss and threw the ball first. The second team came in second. The second team threw a different ball (same thing: both teams tossed the ball). Both teams ran 10 times. The third team came in fourth. Each team attempted a different type of tackle. They hit the same number of times. Now, the fourth-place team was trying to catch the second-place team. The first, second, and third teams were trying to hold the ball. Finally, the forth-place team caught and held the ball. The fourth-place team lost it. The coaches put a $10 buy-in on the game after the fourth-place team lost. The $10 buy-in would pay for an extra coach for the fourth-place team and more food for each player. That added up to a total of $200. The coaches paid for $200 in food before the 4th-place team even kicked off the game. The coaches would spend $200 before the game was half-played. How much is that for the game? What if all four teams used a different number of players? Then the total amount would be $200 for all teams combined. The total cost would be divided evenly among the players and coaches. What is the team worth?   Is there a minimum and maximum price for food and drinks?\nOutput: $100", "answer": "D: further education"}

He can:  1. use the same answer  2. learn the answer a second time (using the answer for each of the three students)  3. rewrite the problem.

Consider the fact that the majority of the students are thinking independently and they are not being told to answer the question.\n5. The question is very hard to answer so, if you are unsure, find another way to answer it.\n6. Some students are studying for exams and others are studying to get ahead in college.\n7. Some students do not feel comfortable writing short essays about their opinions of a complicated topic.\n8. Some students just prefer to learn rather than read.\n9.

However, it should be clear to the student that not telling the truth does not mean there is a loss of privacy when faced with a difficult challenge, as in situations such as a financial crisis, where secrecy can be helpful. It is important for students to understand that when a difficult situation arises in their life, being open and honest about their situation will not result in the loss of privacy, but will instead have the contrary effect of removing the possibility of being made into a victim of deception.\n\nThis discussion question is for homework and is not graded based on knowledge of the concepts of Truth, Falsehood, or Deception. Students will be able to apply the concepts of Truth, Deception, and Truthiness to their own moral beliefs and practice.\n\nThis review unit introduces students to the concept of truth. We will describe the concepts of truth, truthiness, and falsehood. The concepts will be discussed in depth in subsequent revision units. Students will also be able to evaluate the value of truth and their own role in determining the value of a statement or event. A discussion about the value of honesty will conclude this review. At the end of this review unit we will discuss the concept of Truthiness.\n\nThis is the fourth of six revision units related to the concept of truth in science and mathematics. Questions pertaining to this review unit can be found in the questions file for this unit. Questions are divided into four parts:  1) Truth: How do we know a particular statement is true? 2) Truthiness: What might we do if we truly thought a statement was false or exaggerated? 3) Truthiness and Falsehoods: How do we know certain statements to be truthful or false? 4) Truthiness and Deception: How do we know that a statement is deceptive, or perhaps exaggerated?

{"text": "4\n\nIn many situations the key to understanding a child requires insight into the child's behavior.\nOne of the easiest ways for parents to understand and guide their children is to look at their behavior. It is not always easy to see if your child has a good or bad behavior. Parents often have to do things in the moments of chaos without realizing it or noticing it. So the key to knowing about a childs behavior is understanding what the child is trying to communicate and responding appropriately when it is appropriate.\n\nMany situations require the parents of a child to help understand what the child believes or wants to say. When parents are asking a child to speak up, they do not necessarily know the response. Often their reactions to a child's speech are a direct result of the childs actions or behavior. Learning things like what a child is trying to communicate is important for learning, understanding and guiding your childs behavior.\n\nHere are some of the common situations in which a child communication needs help:\n\nCrying\nWhen a child is upset it is often hard to understand their feelings or to understand them in the moment. Usually a child will need to be guided through their tears. Sometimes parents do not recognize the cry as a cry until they have a little bit of time to themselves to process the emotion and think about it. The simple act of telling a child to calm down will be the most effective in helping a child understand when the cry is normal.\nIf a child appears sad and does not feel like he is being heard, try to listen and respond in accordance with where he is trying to communicate. If he is screaming, you need to stop and understand. If he is upset or crying calmly say, \"Mommy is sorry I upset you.\" If you do not stop and try to understand in the moment, you will continue to have a lot of difficult situations with your children.\n\nFor parents, the most effective thing to do in these situations is to listen and help guide your children through their emotions. If a child is having trouble putting his feelings into words and you do not know how to help or do not know how to do the help, do not feel bad. Sometimes there are just not enough words for a child to express himself effectively and the best thing to do is to listen and guide the child to do what he would like to be done.\n\nCommunication\nCommunication is the basic language that all children use. A child wants to make sure that he is understood clearly and correctly. A", "answer": "C: control children"}

The length of the time that the player can control his time before he gets out in the garden is determined by two things: (1) the number of squares that are left on the toilet paper roll and (2) the number of squares in his own bathroom that he needs to use. A player who tells his teammate to go from one of his own bathroom stalls to the boys' bathroom must time out within 2 seconds (2), after which he is not allowed to go further. (Players cannot be out in the rain without first leaving the bathroom.) Players can also delay starting the game by going to a different location for 5 seconds (not counting time in bathroom). A player must then be allowed 10 seconds to move to another stall.\nOutput: 5\n\nOutput:Mary says the word yes. She tells the kids to go outside but she is angry at Sarah\u2019s refusal. If a player\u2019s actions violate this command, Mary is allowed 3 seconds to command them to leave. If the action violated this command, Mary is again allowed 3 seconds to command the player to leave. If a player\u2018s action was not in violation of this command, she may time out.\nOutput: 3\n(1)2)3)4)\n\nInput:Mary is standing on the edge of her bed when she sees a little boy dressed in a red suit.

In the example below, for number A, the amount of dollars in any container is equal to the number of coins in the container.\nOutput: 16\n\nFeedback:Please answer the following questions.\n\nFeedback #1: If the number of numbers in a container is equal to 10 and the number of coins in a container is equal 1, then how many coins in a container equal 1?\nOutput: 6(50)\n\nFeedback #2: If the number of dollars in an open container is equal to 100, the container must be equal to 1, because the amount of coins equals the number of dollars in the container. In the example below the container equals 100.\nOutput: 14\n\nFeedback #3: In the example below there are 100 dollars in the container. The container is equal to 10, because the amount of dollars equals the amount of coins in the container which are 10. In the example below we're not sure the container was equal to 10 since the number of coins equals ten, and there are only 15 dollars, which equals 1, so there is equal to 50 in the container.\nOutcome: 3, the number of coins equals 1\n\nIn order for the number 50 to equal 100 dollars, the container must be the same size. Therefore the container would have equal number of coins, therefore the number of dollars in it must be equal to 1 (50/1 = 50 / 2). Therefore the amount of coins must be equal 100.\n\nIf the container can only hold 2, then the container must have been a smaller container at the beginning for the same number of dollars, therefore the amount of coins must also be equal 100.\nOutput: 1, the number of coins is greater than 2 = 10 in the container = 2 in the container = 2, therefore it is equal to 5 in the container = 5 in the container. Therefore it is equal to 10 in total = 10 in total = 10\n\nInput: Mary has five new pens in her school\u2019s school supply kit. Each pen has a paper weight in it.

Mary never had a friend named Zach for very long and when she became an adult, she decided that the best way to find new friends was to make new friends.  She decided she would do just that and started a new friendship with a boy named Michael.  Both Mary and Michael became friends for life and they still see each other regularly.  When Michael became an adult and had children, he made some new friends.  He brought his children with him as he adopted two boys from Africa and the two boys became friends.  The one brother was not an adult when Mary's children were born and his friends were happy to see a boy in his early 20's.  He was the middle brother of the group and the two oldest children called him their big brother.  When they were old enough to drive, Mary and Michael went shopping.  They went to every store in town and each purchase was carefully recorded in Mary's journal.  One day the boy who had become Mary's big brother and she, were talking about their new friends and how wonderful it would be if they could all get together.  Mary said that she never thought she would be able to make that happen so soon.  It had been a long time since she had last seen Zach and the two boys were still friends.  Later Mary moved back to her old school and was asked to be a class friend for another boy named Nathan.  The two boys were close and they talked often even about their families.  In fact, both boys have adopted their parents.  When Mary had reached retirement age, two new friends were made.

{"text": "D\n\nComments\n\nHi! I'm one of the authors. I appreciate your interest in this game.\n\nThe game is based around an idea that some of the kids get when they have the teacher on their side. The idea is to give yourself the benefit of the doubt and give your teacher/teachers money, and sometimes they will also give you money.\nOne of the kids asked for money. I gave some money for him. But my mom said it was money for that little kid at the playground. I showed the parents the receipts and that it was for Tuan. They still don't believe me. So the teacher put a big old grin on her face and asked me, \"How did you know my son was your son? You should have just given him the money!\" (Of course, the kids can make up any reason, such as the parents were talking)\n\nThe teacher is there to help the kids. You don't have to give her too much money. She needs to have some way to raise funds for children in need in Cambodia!\n\nThank you so much for doing this game! Your work is really impressive and the game will be really helpful for kids in Cambodia!", "answer": "A: school children"}

He sat down on the bench to draw the bench. It took about 15 minutes for him to do all the drawing on the bench. A half hour later, he noticed that most of the drawing was missing. So, he drew the bench again. Unfortunately, he realized that most of the drawing on the second bench was also missing. He finished the second bench and left. 15 minutes later, he noticed that the second bench was even more blank than the first. A half hour later he realized that most of his work was missing on both benches. 10 minutes later he realized that he has no clue how to fix any of the two benches. What did he do next? He sat down on the first bench and finished the drawing. 10 minutes later he noticed again that much of the second drawing had been lost. In 15 minutes, he finished the second bench and moved on. What did he do today? He sat down on his father's bench and finished the drawing again. 10 minutes later he spotted that the bench was even worse than the first one. He finished the second and abandoned all his work on the first bench and moved on. He finished the second one and abandoned none of his work on the first. Is this a great achievement? How many hours did he spend drawing on his father's bench? How many hours did his father spend drawing on the first bench? And how much time did he spend doing any of the work? These two benches are approximately equal in size. So, in his case, he only spent one hour doing each drawing on each bench. A few minutes after his first drawing finished, he took a picture with his father\u2019s camera. So, he spent two hours taking pictures of his father\u2019", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

What was the cost per ounce?\nOutput: 3.35\n\nSubstitute each answer with \"How can this be?\" and use the correct answer.\n\nHow could this occur?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt's easy to use this prompt to determine exactly how often we can expect to get a paycheck. Simply subtract the number of days that we need to work, then multiply that number by the amount of money we're guaranteed to make every week plus the average amount of money that we're going to get per week. Add the two numbers and you'll have an idea of how much we're owed.\n\nExample:\nI get paid $50 every Friday. If I worked every week I would have an average of $500 to spend at the mall on Saturdays with no minimum pay. And since I'm used to getting $5 as a allowance per week, my paycheck has an average of $50 to spend in one weekend.\n\nIn most cases, it's simply a matter of having one more meal to pay off before payday.\n\nAnswer:\nSubtract the amount you think you will get in weekly paychecks. Then multiply that number by 3-4 and it will give you how much per week you should have on hand for emergencies such as new clothes to wear out to lunch, food to eat while you clean the house, etc.\n\nExample:We could buy a new house or a car and pay off the loans on our car.\n\nOr, we could save money by spending less.\n\nOr, you could try living within your means or start investing more into stock and bond funds.\n\nQuestion:\nDo you use a regular calendar that is set out in columns and rows, or do you use one in lines and columns", "answer": "C: fly"}

The total number of digits in the array should be 2. The length of the array should be 16. The total number of stars should be 8.  The digits at the ends should be 1.  The number of stars in the array should be 7.  If a star can have 0, 13 or more digits, the total number of digits at the ends of it should be 1.  4 stars = 2 bits  9 stars = 3 bits  13 stars = 4 bits  17 stars = 5 bits  21 stars = 8 bits  27 stars = 18 bits  42 stars = 32 bits  51 stars = 40 bits  66 stars = 66 bits\nOutput:  1x2 = 1 bits  2x2 = 2 bits  4x2 = 4 bits  8x2 = 8 bits  16x2 = 16 bits  32x2 = 32 bits for all rocks\nInput:A color, B and C on another color.

The answer to B may not be too surprising, but the answer to A is very interesting. Both answers show the value of not doing everything alone and for taking help from people who aren\u2019t experts in your field. In A we found that if you have more than one person working on an assignment, you should try to find a way to reward them for their efforts. In B we also learn that a smart idea is better than a bad idea if you have the right people working on it. You don\u2019t want to take an expensive idea and put it out as a dumb idea.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do everything alone. In B it was suggested that you might want to find different people to work on your project. This is good advice especially if you are spending a lot of time and money.\n\nb. When you ask someone for help, do you want your assistance to be rewarded? A: Yes, I always want to offer help but I would prefer to get it in a different way. Sometimes you can only help so much, even though you really want to do more. Sometimes I would say no but if a student asked me, more times than not I would agree. Some times I would say yes even though I knew I would regret it later.\n\nIn the two examples discussed earlier you see the wisdom in asking for help. I believe it\u2019s wise to try to find someone other than your family and friends to help you.\n\nc. When a teacher asks for help with an assignment you should help out the best you can, but don\u2019t be a pushover. If your teacher is helpful but unaccepting, maybe it doesn\u2019t help you in anyway to give up the effort needed to do the assignments.\n\na. In the two examples discussed earlier, it seems like if you ask for help you should eventually be rewarded for your efforts. But that statement doesn\u2019t necessarily hold true. For instance, in A, Sarah\u2019s math teacher suggested that when she gives out math problems, she should be rewarded for her efforts. When I was in junior", "answer": "A: mouth"}

When Michael gets to her place, he sets up the dog's walk by letting the dog walk up and down the stairs and by calling her name as she begins to walk.  After a few minutes, Michael turns off the alarm and turns on a timer.  When the timer goes off, he turns off the alarm, sets the dog off her walk, turns the alarm back on, turns off the alarm, and goes back to sleep.  When his timer goes off again in the morning, he sets the dog off her new walk at the same time that he sets his alarm clock each morning. When his timer goes off at midnight, he turns off the timer; puts Michael to bed; turns the alarm back on; and turns the alarm off. When Michael gets up in the morning, he hears that his alarm clock has been set when the alarm clock was turned off the night before.  If his alarm is set for 3 weeks, how many weeks has Michael's dog been walking everyday?  Out of the total hours that Michael's alarm is set, how much time does Michael's dog keep running back and forth to the living room when it's time for him to get up?  The dog has spent a total of 8 hours of running back and forth and has saved 1,800 hours of running for the year. When Michael's dog is done, he turns in both the alarm clock and her leash.\nOutput: (1-3)/6 = 3.  What are the hourly costs that Michael's dog used on his leash?  The cost per hour would be:  60 x 0.1 = 5.6 cents.\nOutput: 3\nOutput: How many miles do Michael's dog have walked this year?\nOutput: 5,400\n\nInput: Mary wants to give her 5 year old son all of the candy she", "answer": "A: food"}

The teacher then told Alyssa that the next day wasn't too bad because he had his next-door neighbors that were really nice to do her math for her. The next day the neighbor came by to do her math for free. That next math problem in particular was easy because he gave her all of the problems in his book and he told her that each day he would give one student that could not do all of the problems.

Finally the next week he gave her a really hard math problem that he said that he was sure that she could not do. That was a really hard math problem because it ended up being 3 more years before she completed that math problem.

He might be bored, or lonely, or lonely and bored, or a little angry, but none of these actions are harmful.  In this article we have chosen to list five ways that a boy can have a positive experience while at school.\n\nPLAY:\n\nPARKING THE BUS:\n\n When boys in middle school begin going to school for the first time they usually take the school bus.  Boys that stay homeschooled often avoid this experience.  When boys at school take private vehicles for school trips they still have to pay the driver to take them there, even though they don't have to make the trip themselves.  These expenses add up quickly.  Sometimes the bus driver will put on concerts for the students, or even bring them popcorn.  Students always get something to do on Friday and the cost of these extra expenditures rarely goes away.\n\n When boys start to learn driving, they often get a car.

The boy\u2019s mom made a promise that she would cure the boy of his Aspergers Syndrome before he turns 16. The boy turned out to be a boy with a genetic defect that made it hard for him to speak effectively and make eye contact. When the boy reached the legal age to marry, he found it increasingly difficult to find a suitable wife who would make him feel comfortable around her. He also couldn\u2019t find many suitable women who were his age. One day when the boy was having a conversation with a girl, the girl noticed the boy\u2019s blank stare, a sign that he might not be interested in her. She felt it was important to tell him how much she liked him. For the rest of the conversation, the girl asked him to show his interest in her repeatedly by making eye contact. She eventually succeeded and the boy said he liked her very much. Afterwards, the girl wrote an essay that thanked the boy for his kindness. After telling the boy about it, the boy felt ashamed that he had ever felt rejected so he changed the subject to something else. To make amends, he sent the girl some money. Two weeks later, the son was diagnosed with a genetic defect similar to Aspergers Syndrom and his mom promised to cure him by the time he turned 16. After 6 years of suffering, the boy was finally cured. He no longer has Aspergers Syndrome. But he does have a defect that makes him more difficult to relate to others. When he was 16 years old, she asked for a divorce. He says the condition stopped him from developing feelings for anyone and, like other people with Aspergers Syndrome, he has difficulty expressing himself in conversations. His mom decided that she would no longer take the boy to family gatherings or participate in any other activities at the boy\u2019s school. Instead of being discouraged, his mom says the condition has brought him closer to the people around him. He now feels much loved and is happy to now have an active lifestyle. In the same essay, the girl describes her feelings about the boy. She felt sad when he had to go away from her. She felt heartbroken that she was unable to help him make a better life. She felt sad that he couldn\u2019t express his feelings to her. She feels happy that he is happy and her emotions seem to have changed after", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}

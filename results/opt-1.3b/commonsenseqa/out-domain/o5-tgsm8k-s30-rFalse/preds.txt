An average person with a high degree can make more money using his education than an average person with a low degree.<n>Output: 1<n><n>Input: In the 1940’s, there was a shortage of work for teachers, so the government took matters into its own hands. They offered free education for people who wanted to attend high school from Kindergarten through Senior High School. A child was then allowed to be eligible for college after high school. Each student needed six years of education in order to take the university entrance exams.   The government also offered special benefits to families of teachers (like reduced taxes, and free medical check-ups).  If a student didn’t complete the six years of education, the government paid for half his university education, with the student helping to maintain the house that house helped pay for.  In order to qualify, a child needed to graduate high school, and pass the entrance exams. Only one class per year was allowed per student, and students could only continue their university studies for up to 5 years.   By 1968, the number of students in the country had grown considerably. Since the government was paying for half the courses for all students, the number of people in high school was still limited, forcing many teachers to stay in elementary school for as long as possible.  By the late 1970’s, the number of high school graduates had grown, and had nearly doubled in 6 years. The problem of the shortage of teacher was solved, and the number of people in schools had grown significantly by the 80’s.  The government tried to solve the housing problem by issuing vouchers to parents who wanted their child to receive an education and/or a high school education for their children.  Over one million students were enrolled in schools, with 7 million more in post-secondary education

He decides to purchase a 2005 Yamaha Bonneville Touring motorcycle. The first month he is planning to put $700.00 toward the boat. He uses $200.00 for gasoline costs. He spends $300.00 on maintenance, including the motorcycle’s oil, tire and service. In total, he would spend $1100.00 for just the motorcycle.  Next, he plans to buy his son new school clothes. He adds up the costs for the clothes:<n>month of clothes and uniforms for 7 kids total = $12,200.00<n>month of new school clothes for 3 kids total = $2,800.00<n>Total = $24,800.00<n>month of car maintenance for his son’s car = $0<n><n>Output: John purchased the boat and a car a year ago. He purchased the motorcycle four months ago. His income is now $9,000 per year, and $9,000 of it is in the form of income from the boat and the motorcycle. With these expenses in mind, he expects the boat and bike to increase his income by $2,000 over the next year, or 13%. He also expects the car and motorcycle to increase his income by an additional $1,200 by the 12th month. With this additional $1,200, John expects his yearly income to rise by $33,000 over the next 12 months. If his income rose to $21,000, he could afford the boat outright, the car, the motorcycle, his son’s clothes, and his son’s school clothing.<n><n>Feedback<n><n>I agree the question is

An attorney representing the city says the litigation would likely cost the city about $20 million.  A judge last week ruled in favor of the state in forcing Austin to begin providing water for free.  The decision was made about two weeks after the city cut water service to thousands of residents, starting April 1.  The judge, William Gossett, said public health and safety were of “greater value” than the legal costs.  The governor ordered water shut-offs for more than 30,000 households in February 2009 over an unpaid invoice from the city.  The cutbacks were imposed when a federal judge declared the city’s emergency-management plan unlawful.<n>Output: water<n><n>Input: A student in a math class is asked what the relationship between 6 x 7 / 2 x 4 and 6 x 7 / 6 is.

He has a car and trailer out back at his property. There are several other car owners and their trailers on different lots adjacent to the trailer.     It is difficult to park on the lot because of the large numbers of cars. The trailer owners try to park as close as possible. Car owners try to park just in front of their trailers.     Some car owners are upset with this situation. They believe that parking on someone else‘s lot means that they have to park closer than normal.     The owner of the trailer closest to the car owner’s trailer is upset because he thinks that this means that the car owner has to park closer than normal to his trailer.    The owner does not seem to hear any complaints from the other car owners.     If the car owners did not have different lots, but different lots connected by the same road or street, there would be no conflict between car owners.

Their parents are not in charge of running their car.     G: A house is moved every two weeks.<n>    In addition, when there is any construction work to be done on the home, the neighbors are affected because they know that the work will affect the neighbor’s home and not the home of the home owner.

What is the amount earned by this man if he works all day long?<n>Output: $900<n><n>Answer Question:<n><n>The first method was the simplest because it was designed to capture the entire range of possible answers. The second method was a little more difficult to evaluate since it includes answers that were not specifically asked for and that are not directly related to the problems.<n>The third method was also easier to understand that the other two since it provided a range of possible answers. However, the most important aspect of the method was to assess how reliable the answers were or were not. There was no point in asking an answer that was not very likely to be right. If the questions were vague, or even confusing, the answer was unlikely to be right even if it was the right answer. That would be unacceptable since the goal was a fair assessment of the answers.<n>The second method (sociological analysis) was the easiest, but it provided only a range of possible solutions. The range of possible answers may have been broad, but given that it was a class on the sociology of economics at a university, the range was probably not too broad since the problems were mostly economic. The range was broad enough, however, to be somewhat difficult to evaluate.<n>The third method (logical reasoning) was the most complex of the three because the question was not a particular question at all. It was merely one of many possible answers. That made it difficult to evaluate because it is difficult to see how an answer will work in each possible situation. The answers were vague and difficult to evaluate because the range of possible answers was so large.<n>I believe that the best method had been the second method (sociology), but it was not the best method because it was a poor form of social science.<n>The method I prefer was the third method (logical reason) and the most accurate. At least in judging how well the answer was likely to be right, it did a very good job. At least in judging the accuracy, though, it could stand to improve. However, there are not many ways to improve the

The agency has decided to hold a national fair and competition to replace the long-dormant American survey. A competition may include five field trips.   The first field trip is to the National Park Service and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.   The second field trip is to the Bureau of Land Management and the third field trip is to NOAA, which is part of the USGS.  The fourth field trip is to the University of Washington. The last field trip is to NOAA.  The agency has set a minimum age requirement of 10 years old for participation in the national competition.   As a result, the USGS will be closing its regional offices. Some local offices are being opened under the same conditions without the age requirement. Some of the field trips will take place in the summer.  The agency has sent an e-mail to all registered field trip participants, requesting their preferences for trip assignments.   Each participant will have to supply their own supplies.   If any field trip destinations have been determined, the agency will contact participants through e-mail only.<n><n>Input: A plane carrying a family of six from Miami is en route to Chicago.

The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: 52<n><n>Input:What would happen to you if you are not good at playing violin? Choices:  A: happiness B: relaxation C: create music D: sadness E: loud noises<n>Output:		 A<n><n>1, The animal transport truck holds only 20 head of cattle. That is 20 animals per truck. The transportation cost is $50.00 per animal per day. The travel time to town is 3 hrs. Thus, the cost per year is $1500. When calculating the cost of renting a car for each day, multiply the travel time by the rental cost. 2, If they rent a tractor, the cost is $100.00 per trip per vehicle per day. The travel cost is $1000.00 per trip per tractor per day. Thus, the cost to lease a tractor and driver per year is $1000.00 x 365 for each tractor. 3, The total transport cost per year is $1000, so the cost to rent a tractor to drive and lease an animal transport truck are $1250.00. The total cost per year is $4000.00.<n>4, One boy receives $3900 for sharing the total cost per year. He shares an equal distribution of the cost to the six other boys. Each boy receives $2000 per year to use for his own pleasure. The total cost per week is $1900, so each boy receives $1000 for his enjoyment. This amount is a lot more than $1000 for the six boys. Thus, the four boys must each receive $800 for their enjoyment. 4a, The total cost is $400, so no boys make any money. 4b, The cost is more than $1000. So no boys have to share $3900. 4c, So no boys make money.<n>Note:<n>* Use the same procedure (minus the travel time) to calculate the cost<n>of renting a car per day and multiplying the cost by the rental cost.<n>* Each of the numbers would not be 1 or 0 because of the difference between<n>the amount paid by the owner of the car and the amount charged by his<n>customer.<n><n>Click to expand...<n><n>Well you answered the questions.

The total cost is not $4000.<n><n>So, you answered A and B correctly. The reason is because the total<n>travel cost minus the rental cost is multiplied by the rental car cost.<n>The answer was B.

The first is income. The second is investment. Money is created when one person creates money by depositing it in some other one’s account and creating credit. When there are enough people with enough money to create an entire city’s economy, that city then becomes rich.

George was staying in an apartment owned by another farm worker, but he was unable to afford to pay market rates for rent, so he rented out his apartment each day. George had two children, both living at home in their late 20s. The children never seemed to spend time with their father, and they never asked the father for money to help support the family. When George died last year, nobody from the family came to claim the body of George because they had no contact with him. The funeral was held without the children and the father’s will.

The children decided they needed to speak with the family, and they asked the son and heir to come visit his father. Although the son took his own life a week later, a hearing was held and the heirs agreed to allow the children to stay with their father until their mother returned from a nursing home. Three years after George’s passing, his son died, and the grandchildren continued to live with him until they too had died. The grandchildren’s mother arrived in 2007.

The company pays $100,000 or $100,000 in depreciation to each vehicle. The total annual cost is about $25,000 or $25,000 per year. The depreciation is 10 times the cost. Which means that the average cost, divided by 3 is 50%, or $175. But this is incorrect. To divide it by 3 you would have to take inflation (i.e., the rate of increase) into account. If we add up the cost of the cars per year it would be $0 less than $275,000. Therefore, the depreciation is $25,000 minus $25,000. This also means that the depreciation is not 50% but 50% less than $25,000. The depreciation is not 50% of the cost of the cars or 50% less than $125,000 ($25,000 minus $100,000 minus $75,000 for total depreciation).<n>Input = B<n> output = c<n><n>input: A woman is looking for a new dress at a clothing chain.

She gets in the shower and immediately stands up.  She reaches out to adjust her hair, but realizes that she can’t get comfortable.  She lies down and rests her head on the towel rack.  She feels warm and comfortable, but then feels a tingling sensation in her legs.  She wonders if she was still asleep.  In the morning one of her neighbors is visiting the house and sees her lying down and thinking to herself, “My daughter can’t stay in that house.”  She gets up and goes to inspect her house.  The house appeared to be pristine.   She asks the man if he checked her house out carefully the night before and he says, “I’m not sure.  The only thing I checked was her.”  Then she asks the man if his wife checked out properly.  Again, the man is not sure.  They decide to take a look anyway.  Inside, there is evidence that she may have been disturbed by the experience.   They decide to take her to a Doctor because they can’t imagine why she would spend $200 a month in rent for the past two years and not report it.  The Doctor confirms her fear that she may have been sexually assaulted.  The Doctor explains to the couple that no sex crimes can ever be prevented in a house of this nature, but that they should take advantage of an emergency shelter.  They decide to go to the Emergency Shelter and stay there for the week until they have a place to live.  As they get closer to leaving, the Doctor’s wife complains of being ill.  She has been vomiting continuously since breakfast.  The Doctor diagnoses her as having a food poison.  He suggests they take her to the hospital for more expensive medication.  The Doctor’s wife turns in her key and asks the Doctor for the key back.  The Doctor”s wife asks if it would be a problem if they were in the house that night.  The Doctor says, ”No, we can stay the night.”  He then gives them the keys to the house.  He then suggests that they take the emergency shelter to make sure that the damage to the house has not been done, and that they take several people to the hospital.  They agreed and the Doctor took the phone call and put the Shelter

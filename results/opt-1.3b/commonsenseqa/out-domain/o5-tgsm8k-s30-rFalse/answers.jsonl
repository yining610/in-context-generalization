With the government, the average person has a high level of education, but may never acquire the qualifications he needs to be a successful businessman. An average person with a high degree can make more money using his education than an average person with a low degree.\nOutput: 1\n\nInput: In the 1940\u2019s, there was a shortage of work for teachers, so the government took matters into its own hands. They offered free education for people who wanted to attend high school from Kindergarten through Senior High School. A child was then allowed to be eligible for college after high school. Each student needed six years of education in order to take the university entrance exams.   The government also offered special benefits to families of teachers (like reduced taxes, and free medical check-ups).  If a student didn\u2019t complete the six years of education, the government paid for half his university education, with the student helping to maintain the house that house helped pay for.  In order to qualify, a child needed to graduate high school, and pass the entrance exams. Only one class per year was allowed per student, and students could only continue their university studies for up to 5 years.   By 1968, the number of students in the country had grown considerably. Since the government was paying for half the courses for all students, the number of people in high school was still limited, forcing many teachers to stay in elementary school for as long as possible.  By the late 1970\u2019s, the number of high school graduates had grown, and had nearly doubled in 6 years. The problem of the shortage of teacher was solved, and the number of people in schools had grown significantly by the 80\u2019s.  The government tried to solve the housing problem by issuing vouchers to parents who wanted their child to receive an education and/or a high school education for their children.

Each man earns $300. A man working full time earns another $300 himself when he is sick, is out of work, or has no work. What is the amount earned by this man if he works all day long?\nOutput: $900\n\nAnswer Question:\n\nThe first method was the simplest because it was designed to capture the entire range of possible answers. The second method was a little more difficult to evaluate since it includes answers that were not specifically asked for and that are not directly related to the problems.\nThe third method was also easier to understand that the other two since it provided a range of possible answers. However, the most important aspect of the method was to assess how reliable the answers were or were not. There was no point in asking an answer that was not very likely to be right. If the questions were vague, or even confusing, the answer was unlikely to be right even if it was the right answer. That would be unacceptable since the goal was a fair assessment of the answers.\nThe second method (sociological analysis) was the easiest, but it provided only a range of possible solutions. The range of possible answers may have been broad, but given that it was a class on the sociology of economics at a university, the range was probably not too broad since the problems were mostly economic. The range was broad enough, however, to be somewhat difficult to evaluate.\nThe third method (logical reasoning) was the most complex of the three because the question was not a particular question at all. It was merely one of many possible answers. That made it difficult to evaluate because it is difficult to see how an answer will work in each possible situation. The answers were vague and difficult to evaluate because the range of possible answers was so large.\nI believe that the best method had been the second method (sociology), but it was not the best method because it was a poor form of social science.\nThe method I prefer was the third method (logical reason) and the most accurate. At least in judging how well the answer was likely to be right, it did a very good job. At least in judging the accuracy, though, it could stand to improve. However, there are not many ways to improve the", "answer": "A: work in life"}

The company pays $100,000 or $100,000 in depreciation to each vehicle. The total annual cost is about $25,000 or $25,000 per year. The depreciation is 10 times the cost. Which means that the average cost, divided by 3 is 50%, or $175. But this is incorrect. To divide it by 3 you would have to take inflation (i.e., the rate of increase) into account. If we add up the cost of the cars per year it would be $0 less than $275,000. Therefore, the depreciation is $25,000 minus $25,000. This also means that the depreciation is not 50% but 50% less than $25,000. The depreciation is not 50% of the cost of the cars or 50% less than $125,000 ($25,000 minus $100,000 minus $75,000 for total depreciation).\nInput = B\n output = c\n\ninput: A woman is looking for a new dress at a clothing chain.", "answer": "D: more funding"}

It was easy for the women to get on his good side while the men got on his bad.\n\n[T.R.] was a brilliant man, but more importantly, he was a good man. He knew how to treat others. He could be funny and witty, he could be ruthless and manipulative, he could be downright intimidating, but in all cases he was very nice and considerate. The average American today isn't that way.

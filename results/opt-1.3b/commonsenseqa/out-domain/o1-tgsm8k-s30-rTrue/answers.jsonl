{"text": "Bankruptcies must be stopped.\n\nOutput: A corporation is a legal fiction. The corporation is not actually owned and operated by its shareholders. Therefore, the shareholder controls the whole corporation and, thus, by proxy, the directors of the corporation. As a company grows large, the shareholder control over the corporation grows. When the shareholder becomes so small that he or she cannot control the direction of the company, the shareholder is said to be \"bought out\" of control. The shareholders agree not only to sell to, i.e., be bought by, a new owner, but also to give up control over the company at least some of the time and to have the new owner control 100% of the company for life time. The shareholder who is bought out must be paid off in full immediately after the sale. The buyer must pay the same price that the old shareholder paid for the company.\nThe new owner is not allowed to add staff, expand, or otherwise increase the company's assets.

{"text": "Make money Pay debts Make money Keep house\nInput: How much money does an average worker get? OutPUT:\n\n**Questions and responses may have been edited for clarity.**\n\nAnswer #1:\nThe answer: $190\n\nThe pay for an average worker in the United States is $9,093.[7] As of 2016, the median annual salary of U.S. workers (as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) is $53,846, and it ranges from $36,847 ($21,869 annual female wage) to $76,834 ($50,944 annually for male).\n\nAnswer #2: Yes, but not for that reason. The answer: No, and not for that reason.\n\nThe total pay of an average American worker in 2009 was $41.92. The average salary of men was $60,080, and that of women was $30,873. However, if we take into account the value of Social Security and Medicare as well as the higher cost of health care, a worker with a Social Security and Medicare card in 2009 could expect to receive an average retirement benefits check of just under $63,000.\n\nAnswer #3: Some people can retire at lower rates than others.\n\nIn the 2012 election cycle, Mitt Romney earned $100,800 as a Bain Capital consultant while Senator Barack Obama made $43,000 as a Chicago Law instructor.\n\nAnswer #4: Most people work for at least 25 years.\n\nOn average, most people in the United States work for 25 to 29 years, not 20, on average.\n\nAnswer #5: Some people can retire earlier than others.\n\nEven if a person has only worked for 20 years, they may still be able to retire earlier than an employee with 30 years of service.\n\nAnswer #6: Yes.\n\nRetirees with 15 years of service on average were able to save $2,400 per year on Social Security in 2012, and those with more than 15 years of service save roughly 10% of their salary ($4,500). As Social Security benefits increase over time, a person's lifetime income is reduced by $2,400 per annum.\n\nAnswer #7: An increase in average earnings for women since 1970 is explained by the wage gap.\n\nThe average annual earnings for both men and women are only slightly higher when adjusted for inflation (", "answer": "D: making money"}

Banks are institutions that create money and loans. Banks are responsible for money creation. Money is also called money and bank credit. Banks usually handle cash and securities. Money is usually created by banks by lending money. Banks also create other forms of loans such as letters of credit and reverse mortgages. Some people may have money, although banks create money too and may lend the money to people or collect interest payments. Banks usually provide loans to small businesses or for personal purchases. In some countries such as Norway banks offer loans to individuals. Banks are also in charge of the exchange rate of money. Banks have the obligation to lend money and pay interest to their clients. Banks offer their clients banking services, which also includes dealing with currency and investments. As money is needed, money can come out of a bank.\nIn Canada, a bank is a private corporation, typically a government or international organization, that holds assets of the public, to be managed and maintained by the corporation in trust for the public.

There are 6 doctors in each hospital.\nHow many people could die from starvation if there wasn\u2019t any food?\nOutput: The most obvious way of determining the effect on food is\nto try to calculate the number of people that would die from\nstarvation.\nA person in a starving country is worth 25 times what a person\nin a rich country is.\nIf there is a famine in all the hospitals in an area of the world,\nthen the starvation rate is 50%.\nThen each doctor in the hospital does the calculation twice. In\nthat case, it would be 25% per doctor.\nIn some parts of the world, such as India or Nigeria, the doctor\nmakes the calculation 3 times. This yields 50% per doctor\nstarvation rate.\nThen if there is a famine in each doctor\u2019s hospital, there is\n25 times as many people that die of starvation as there were in\nthe poor country.\nIn other parts of the world, the doctor calculates all three\ntimes. This yields the same starvation rate: 50% per doctor.\nEach doctor makes his calculation a few dozen times. He will go\nto the hospital, see if they have bread for patients, and\nthen calculate it. He calculates that each patient can feed\nabout 25 people.\nThen if he runs into a patient who can feed more than 25 people,\nhe can be sure that the patient in the doctor\u2019s hospital would\nnot die of starvation if there were no more food for him.\nOf course, this assumes that the doctor\u2019s is a healthy doctor.\nIf the doctor is overweight, the starvation rate is much\nhigher.", "answer": "C: breaks to help stop"}

{"text": "How much, in food, would be in a jar? What if: A: the jar is filled with jelly B: jelly is stored in a fridge C: jelly is stored in an earthenware vat D: jelly is stored in the cargo ship's storage area E: all the jelly is stored in the closet garage's garage\nSolution: You have to go through and sort by number of units, which adds to the difficulty. Look at the output. So, I guess, food. A jar containing jelly would be about 5-10K, depending on whether it was full or empty, based on the above factors. But I think it's still possible to find the amount of jelly stored in the container in an earthen ware vat. If you go to the source of the container, and you look up the value of the container with the value of the product and divide by two, that gives you the amount in units. Then you subtract that by the value of the jar you have -- that's already a result, so I assume you need to add the jar to the equation: Jar + product = jar (product), but the answer still depends upon what you're assuming the result of that calculation might be.\n\nInput:The amount of money made by the business during the month is $20.

I'd appreciate an answer to this one also. How do I learn how to add, subtract, multiply and divide?\n\nI've tried to find online answers to this, but it's a bit of a pain to find information at your own pace or online. I'm in South Africa, and we can only search through the internet via mobile networks.\n\nI read in class that adding is done by pulling a string, but from what I can find, I understand that you have to multiply by 2 (or possibly 3) afterwords.\n\nSo, here's the problem. I'm working in an excel spreadsheet, and one entry in the right column (which is called Column A, which is where the answers are) has the column title \"Exponentiation\", followed by the word multiplication. In fact, it has the entire right column.\n\nSo, when I click the right column, the entries in right column A (i.e., the column with the answers) change, and I just don't understand why. It makes no sense at all.

You may or may not remember, but after you've memorized it step-by-step it should be much easier to copy and use in a later formula. There is no such thing as \"calculating\" what you have written...it's a \"formula\".\n\nHow is it done?\nIt's done by pulling a string one, then another, then another string. Then you are back where you started, because the answer is in the next cell after you type the initial string. The two string are put together in the same way that the last string is put together first.\n\nThe only other way to do this is by using a calculator, but the way it's done with that you have to learn by typing", "answer": "B: bedroom"}

You probably won't have much of a choice about your car either; when you're paying for your one transaction, the car company will typically decide what type of car to give you.

{"text": "The offspring is 10, the reproduction is 1 baby\n\nInput: What would cause a man to pay $120 for a new car each week if his car is worth $300. One example could be: If his car cost $200 to buy, $80 for gasoline, $120 for tire, $120 for brake repair and $60 for oil, he would need $180 for the entire year. If a man has a wife and family to support, he can be very economical with his money. Two reasons why a man will only spend $120 on a car would be: 1) He has no choice to own a car in his neighborhood or town. 2) The car he currently drives is in poor condition. If a man buys a new car, but doesn't repair and or maintain it, his financial situation is not too different from a poor person's. The reason for most people to buy a new car is because they love the car. They really enjoy the feel of the car. They feel they need the new vehicle, and want to enjoy the driving to the fullest. They also need the comfort of the new vehicle and don't realize that the previous vehicle might be in great need of repairs. The man will know that his new vehicle is worth more than the original car.\nOutput: 10 $60 20 $60\nOne week\n10 $60 20 $60 20 $60", "answer": "A: problems"}

Jennie rented a vehicle for 6 days. How much, $380, in dollars, did Jennie pay for the rental? Output:The first 5 days were $190. There were 7 days remaining, so 5*2*2=5*2*2. On the 6th day, she rented a 6th car, at the office supply store, for 5 days. The office supply store offered a 50-50 chance of free return. So 5 x 10 = 20 dollars, or 50 cents, for a 5-day rental. This worked out to $60 because it's 5 days. 6 x 2 x 5 = 35 bucks. 8 x 2 x 15 = 90 dollars because it's 6 days. So 100. Output:Jennie paid $100.\n\nInput:The car rental agency charges $30/ day for a car, or 190 for the first week for rental that lasts an entire Week or longer.

You can answer in the following\n*1 *2 *3 *4 *5 *6 *7 *8 = $1167.93\n$1167 x 8 = $22,843\n\nSo, if she rented the cars for 11 days, total cost was $22,843, using 30% tax plus state fees plus a tax of 30% for insurance,\n\nSo,\n3,000 - 33.5% = 2,000.25\n\n*2 *3 *4 = 1,857.25\n\n*5 *8 = 19", "answer": "D: office supply store"}

Choices: A: a title B: text C: writing skills D: how to structure the paper E: a conclusion\nOutput: 3-4 pages of information. I give the details of the paper in a one page document.\n\n1 Answer\n\n0 votes\n\nSolution\n\nIt is difficult to come up with a single response, but here are a couple of ways for you to think about the question:\n\nYou could answer with your best guess. It doesn\u2019t have to be a very accurate guess since even if the numbers turn out to be true you will learn something new. This will allow you to apply what you have learned, you will also have something to show for the effort.\n\nOr you could answer from the position of the customer in the rental agency.\n\nAs is, choose the first choice. That way you get a great introduction to a question.\n\nIf you feel that this is unfair and you have not been given an honest answer, ask to speak to a supervisor.\n\nThe Customer\u2019s Perspective:\nShe was the customer and was the one who had to drive back and forth for 11 days. She was concerned about the cost of the rental. The first 7 days were already $190. On the 8th day she learned that there were 4 more days left so that the price of the rental would be $310 total. Thus, she could not afford to stay 11 days.\n\nThe Business Perspective:\nIf the rental agency is charging $30/day, you would expect 7 days per week, $190 for 1 week, $270 for 1 week and $620 for 1 week, for a total of $620, at a total of $230, for 11 days. However, instead of that happened she was charged $430 for only 7 days, $230 for 8 days and $260 for 9 days of rental. She had to get something back.\n\nThe Customer might be a little pissed.\n\nSolution\n\nWhen you write a report your main goal is to gain information. The information you write about can be anything. Information you provide can be any one of the following.\n\nA paper. This might be one of your only sources of information for the rest of your life as a writer. In this case, however,", "answer": "C: speak information"}

The invisible part would still be hidden to someone looking at the invisible part and the invisible part to the invisible part. If that seems strange, think of how light reflects off any opaque surface (like an airplane window). A small portion of that large plane will be shown to you when visible light hits it. How can you see through a large or small aperture? You can't because of the light. And you can't because of the transparent or opaque surface. In the same way if that invisible part of the bar is moving very close to your invisible part of the car you cannot see the invisible part. But if that invisible part is moving away from you very fast (to get past you) you can see the invisible part or invisible part of the car because the invisible part of the bar on the car has moved away from the surface of the invisible part of the car. The invisible part of the car is now transparent to your eyes. If the invisible part of the metal is now moving very fast away from the invisible part of metal, the invisible part becomes invisible to your eyes as well (although invisible to you as well).

Now, it is possible to calculate, in terms of dollars, how much she paid in total for her 11-7 rental.\nBut we have been given the first seven days total cost and the fact that there were eleven-7=4 days remaining on the rental agreement.\nNow, we need a formula to find out how much total of total rental cost was left on the agreement. We can only do this in terms of dollars that she paid in order to complete the rental, so $190 + $30+$2 and $310 are the numbers she has to add up.\n\nIf the total rental cost is $150 then she needs to add $30 for days 8 and 9 and $2 for days 10 and 11.\n\nNow, she has to add up three additional numbers: the total amount of time left on the rental agreement (19) and the cost ($20/day)*(4 - 9 or $190) = $110 so she needs another figure.\n\nNow, to complete the rental, she needs $120, divided by the number of days remaining (2.5 + 11-7+2.5+2.5) = 0.5*19.5 = 0.5 - (2.5 - 9) = 6.5 so she needs 6.5 dollars from her bank account (which currently hovers around the $2 mark).\n\nSo, $60 will pay for 15 days, including the time left on the rental, and she will need $30 to finish the rental by the second payment of $200.\n\nHere are some problems involving this rule:\n\nWhat is the answer to the problem: $70 per day at your school is $120 per day at the one rental agency\nInput: Rent $300 = $120\nOutput: Rent = Rent - $70=$60\ninput :Rent = Rent - $60\nOutput:Rent = Rent - -$60", "answer": "E: government"}

{"text": "A is correct. B is correct. D is incorrect. E is incorrect. E is correct. It becomes the correct answer.\n\nIn this problem, I have 2 vehicles to rent. So, I guess that I would like to know the number of dollars I would have to pay for the rentals. Also, there would be other variables. For instance, the location would need to be very near the evacuation zone.\nTo give you an analogy, suppose I went to Las Vegas for a day and rented a car. I'd probably just pay $600 for the entire weekend, and the entire week would cost $1400. So, what I would like to know is the total price that is required to rent my two vehicles.\n\nYou don't have to think about the other variables. You just have to figure out the number of months you will need to rent in the next week. So, if you needed to rent your vehicle for 6 months, then you need to rent four vehicles for that time period. Now, there are other variables and times to use in this problem. I won't discuss all of them in this problem. So, what I hope that you have learned from this homework is to find the total number of months that you need to purchase before renting the vehicles. Then, you can figure out when you need to rent the vehicles.\n\nRemember, though, that a new vehicle can easily be $3000. Also, I am going to assume that I need to purchase the vehicles for exactly 10 months (or 90 calendar days, whichever comes first-time). Also, I'm going to assume that there will be 10 months of driving that the two cars and 5 or so days that the other car won't be rented because it isn't necessary to drive it every single day. So, all of this assumes that a person does only 3 rental cars every year. I think it probably makes more sense to look at only 3 months of this problem.\n\nNow that you have known how many vehicles you will need and when you need to purchase them, what you need to do is figure out how much you need to earn before you can rent the vehicles. Then, I would like to come back to the question that I gave you last time and try to figure out the value of all these vehicles. I'm going to assume, though, that you already knew that the rent that each of these vehicles would cost me is $30 ($190/day) + $60 ($60/week), so this", "answer": "A: advisory"}

The \"finger\" was the hand to which the sliced onions were brought. The \"body\" may refer to the family or the animal it is on.\nEx: Jane and John bought a dog which was named Sally. Sally is part of their family so Sallys part of your family too. John and Jane bought a dog named Sally to please John\nEx: Joe bought a pair of jeans for $50 which were a size 14. The total cost of the jeans plus tax was $80. When Joe went to pay the register and the cashier saw the size 14, John saw Joe's size and offered to pay 80%. As Joe had a $7.50 balance due and $20 in wages, he paid the cashier $20, which was $70*7.50 =$70.50. The cashier gave him $70.00 and the total was $60 * 7.50 = $60.00. Joe had a $70.50 savings account earning $7.50 per month, and in order to get the $70 in interest he should have had a balance of $80. Therefore, Joe had $80 saved, which equaled $80* 7.50 = $80. Joe needed a new pair of jeans after the first 7 days. He spent $20 to get the pair he had before, and the total spending was $80* 7.5 =$80 which was approximately $100. This was the amount Joe deposited into his new savings account. John gave Joe another $20, so total spending was $110. Joe was pleased with his new purchase and asked John if he needed another shirt, and they agreed to purchase the same pair of jeans they had before, but this time with a $25.00 deposit ($50 + $35 = $75). Because the jeans were slightly bigger in size, they bought two pairs of jeans, one with a $100 deposit ($120 + $25 = $125) to get the $25 in interest, and one with a $100 check ($125 - $35 = $85), which gave Joe a total deposit of $125*$75 + $85*$100 = $125*.\nEx: \"A\" gave his father a $100 check with $25 on the account and $25 left over after paying for his dog.

They issued paper bills, coins, and fixed exchange rates and eventually gold-backed dollars. The dollar was created on the spot market to replace the currency that was issued with silver instead of gold coinage.\nThe dollar was issued and managed by the same bank from which the Federal Reserve banks were started, which had the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The Federal Reserve Act was created to manage central bankers' monetary policy. The American people had no role in the design of the American currency. A central bank issued money by printing or purchasing coinage that was convertible into gold or other goods/services.\nThe people who started the Federal Reserve Act were Congress, the Treasury, and the President.\n\nInput: What was the most important decision made during the 1920s that lead to what we have today?

They needed money that was worth paper money but still needed to have an exchange rate to convert the new currency from one form of money to another that had a use or market.

When I was asked this question in school in 6th grade I never found a satisfactory answer. Now that I am a teacher I would give an A because I do believe that we should be looking for a way to improve the education of our students. In order to do that we should try to be more understanding of the opinions of another human being. This is usually a difficult and challenging situation because we do not always know that we are being unreasonable or unreasonable. We can give an A if we have the ability to have a conversation with an offended learner. This can take time for the teacher and student to get used to each other, but in the long run it works out very well. That is an example of being reasonable. Another example of being reasonable is when you teach what you believe is right. This idea would be more difficult to teach and would require more time because it is harder to teach from where you have learned, rather than from where you are now.\n\nInput:You have an office with 9 people and they are all paid $18/day for the use of their office.

A better question to ask would have been:\n\nIn these exercises, how often were people (and ferrets) exposed to bacteria at the same location? And how frequently were they exposed to the same bacteria or organisms? And, if something was found to be more common than one would expect, how much did it differ from the others?\n\nIn a previous lesson, we were asked to write down the number of times human subjects lived in the same building as at least one species of bacteria. This was done to evaluate the value of having information about how frequent bacteria were found, instead of how frequently people lived there.\nThe data that we collected for this project was the number of times two specific bacteria were found in different places in the same building. To answer the question about the number of times people were exposed to these bacteria at the same location, it would have been reasonable to use a simple model where:\na) a person lived in the same room as an animal,\nb) the animal visited the room,\nc) the person got infected with a bacteria and\nd) the animal was exposed to the bacteria.\n\nAlthough each of the other examples that were given in the lesson are very specific, when we did the second exercise of selecting the organism or bacteria that were most common, we used a more open and broad definition to include any bacteria that commonly spread from person to person, such as:\n\nAny bacteria that usually come into contact with human skin, such as human flu, cat, dog, or cat flu, chicken or dog flu, etc. If something is very likely to spread from person to person among humans, then it would include organisms not mentioned.\n\nIn this example, it is highly unlikely that the person who is sick will expose", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

Output:\nRental fees are very different from normal car insurance.

The rental car insurance premium is much higher than insurance coverage would be.

If you work 40 to 50 hours a week, what is the number of euros a day you earn in a month (i.e. your gross income)?\nOutput: The amount is 4000.\nBecause we are saving for retirement at 40000 yen a month we are also saving for a place to live. If we have to find somewhere to live then the amount is 5000 yen.\n(4*400=2400 yen a month, so 25 euro days are 4 x 4000 yen a month, so 40 euro days are 4 x 2400 yen a month (or 2 x 3000 yen a month).\nThe salary we should be earning monthly is 3500 yen, but it is 3400 yen due to our savings. So the gross salary for a month is 3600 yen, or 3600 yen.\nThe gross take home is 3700 yen, or 3757 yen.\nThe savings are 3000 yen, or 260 yen. So we have to save 1200 yen over and above the gross take home, to get the gross take home.\nSo from the gross take home we should need to save 1800 yen. Therefore our gross take home in month is 2100 yen, or 2100 yen over and above the amount we need to contribute.\nThe gross take-home in month is 2100 yen\n\nWhat are the following combinations?

{"text": "They desire $40\n\n# 2 The following is a mathematical problem about the following.\n\nInput:  A customer can only spend 100 points on a car in a week, or $120, for a rental of 4 days.\nOutput:  At the end of the week, how much did the customer spend?\n\nIf you are not familiar with this format, please follow the instructions below\n\nIt depends. If I had to guess, what would be the odds of a person needing four days to spend $60 at a dealership? If it was $60 each, a four day rental would have to cost $480 or maybe even $540. Then the odds would be really good to want four days. For example if it were $180 for an entire week, I'd go with the car I needed and then the extra day was free. But if you're just planning to drive an hour-and-a-half to your friend's house at the end of the week then the chances of spending all your points in one week is pretty slim. Another factor at play is the age of the person who needs to buy the car. A person who is in his mid-20s is more likely to use more points than a 25-year-old is.", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

The water would need to be cleaned before it would be safe to use again after rain.\n\n#1 is wrong. The answer is E2.\n#2 is right, if you can tell the difference between wet, dry, dry mud and mud.\n#3 is wrong because dirt is not a liquid. When it dries, a lot of the minerals are removed, reducing the mud's potential to hold water.\n\n#2 is correct, I am using the word \"seemingly\" for the first week. The second week is when you are correct to start wearing shoes. The third week is when you need to wash your feet and clean them. So \"dry\" in the first week of wear is not correct.\nYou are also right that you don't need shoes on the first week. I would try my best to stay on my best behaviors until my shoes were dry and then we could test out how many I could do. But it would be much easier to practice and work on my good behaviors.\n\n#2 was correct, I used the'seemingly' phrase to say the first week after rain. Then the following week I said it was no longer possible to walk barefooted. So it depends on the difference between \"seemingly\" and clearly to clarify.\n\n#3 said it depends on the difference and you are right. Then you said to consider them wet? That is not correct as the answer for the wetness is correct, but it should be wetness. Wet implies a lot of liquid, like rain, or just very wet air, rather than a dryness.

{"text": "Which answer is correct?\nThere are 2 ways to look at it\n1. Which answer is correct?A: it is rude to not shake someone's hand\n2. Which answer is correct?A: if you have never met someone by name you are not supposed to know their age, gender, how you shake hands or how long your hair is - you must use a certain number of fingers\n\nIn the above example, a man would shake hands with the man first, then use one hand for the wallet and the other for his other hand (his left) to shake the man's right hand, then he would use his thumb and pointer to open the door for this man. But why would you want to go out of your way to shake his hand using only your middle finger?\n\nLet's assume that your wife and your two friends (which are girls of the same age (in age group)) are going to the movies. If you go to the movies with the three women, you might feel insulted when they shake your hand only with their left hand (they do not shake it with their right hand), the reason, of course. That women are left-handed. So if you want to go with the left-handed, then this is the situation that you should consider. A woman using her right hand for the wallet and palm of her left hand to shake the hand of your left hand makes you feel more insecure. So that's why men prefer to shake hands with the woman first, then the other men if they feel the need.\n\nIf you find that shaking with your non-dominant hand is better than using your dominant hand for the wallet, then the best thing you can do would be to start doing it now. Otherwise, you might be out of balance. It will take some time for your hand to adapt to being used all of the time to shake hands, so you might feel a bit uncomfortable for a while. When you start to \"feel\" that its \"normal\" to shake the hand of the woman you are close to, you might feel more comfortable and the \"inconvenience\" you have felt for some time will be lessened. But its okay to take your time. There is no need to force the left hand, so your husband or spouse can't feel uncomfortable with you doing it on his or her behalf. It's all about the relationship. Do it naturally when you see her using the same hand to shake the hand. If you decide to ask her to", "answer": "C: pay bills"}

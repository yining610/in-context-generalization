As Social Security benefits increase over time, a person's lifetime income is reduced by $2,400 per annum.<n><n>Answer #7: An increase in average earnings for women since 1970 is explained by the wage gap.<n><n>The average annual earnings for both men and women are only slightly higher when adjusted for inflation (

Choices:  A: fridge B: a classroom C: envelope D: medical chart E: sheet music<n>Output:		<n>This is a melody that is commonly heard...<n>The refrigerator is a small closet within the building. One could say that there is a song going on within this closet...<n>I think he/she meant "a note that indicates a melody". But it definitely is heard without knowing the first 3 letters of the words inside.<n><n>(Answers are not meant to be exact, you are allowed to fill in any number that you think fits the question, I know it can be hard, but you only have 4 guesses!)<n>This is another tricky question that is common in questions, and we all like to use our guesses for inspiration.<n><n>1. You can't use the same key as the previous question, therefore you can only use standard tuning.<n>2. You can use standard tuning (as long as you pick the same key as the song)<n>3. As long as you pick the keys corresponding to the melody (or as long as the melody is in key) you'll use standard tuning (if the other question asks standard tuning)<n>4. If you think that the melody is more likely to be in the major scale, you must use an octave higher than the major scale.<n>5. It can be any key, and some people use extra notes (called "taps") to add music to their books.<n>6. It can be any note, and some people write notes on the score, but the author never said that if the music wasn't in key then you cannot use it.<n>7. The melody you choose determines how we read the question, and if the author wants us to read in tune we must read in tune.<n>8. It's impossible to play all the notes on the board using only three chords, so the author decided we should use four, five or six chords, which we do at the beginning and end of the lesson.<n>9. It's impossible to keep all of the notes up on the board for long periods because once we hear the melody, we know what the notes are about to be.<n><n>Incorrect answers will be marked with a "0" next to the post, and those answers will be erased from the post list.<n><n>__________________<n>Took the SATs?

Banks are institutions that create money and loans. Banks are responsible for money creation. Money is also called money and bank credit. Banks usually handle cash and securities. Money is usually created by banks by lending money. Banks also create other forms of loans such as letters of credit and reverse mortgages. Some people may have money, although banks create money too and may lend the money to people or collect interest payments. Banks usually provide loans to small businesses or for personal purchases. In some countries such as Norway banks offer loans to individuals. Banks are also in charge of the exchange rate of money. Banks have the obligation to lend money and pay interest to their clients. Banks offer their clients banking services, which also includes dealing with currency and investments. As money is needed, money can come out of a bank.<n>In Canada, a bank is a private corporation, typically a government or international organization, that holds assets of the public, to be managed and maintained by the corporation in trust for the public. A financial institution is described as "holding assets of the public" when it deals in currency or securities held by the public.

This yields 50% per doctor<n>starvation rate.<n>Then if there is a famine in each doctor’s hospital, there is<n>25 times as many people that die of starvation as there were in<n>the poor country.<n>In other parts of the world, the doctor calculates all three<n>times. This yields the same starvation rate: 50% per doctor.<n>Each doctor makes his calculation a few dozen times. He will go<n>to the hospital, see if they have bread for patients, and<n>then calculate it. He calculates that each patient can feed<n>about 25 people.<n>Then if he runs into a patient who can feed more than 25 people,<n>he can be sure that the patient in the doctor’s hospital would<n>not die of starvation if there were no more food for him.<n>Of course, this assumes that the doctor’s is a healthy doctor.<n>If the doctor is overweight, the starvation rate is much<n>higher.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input:What would you put in a container? Choices:  A: food B: cargo ship C: refrigerator D: closet garage E: port<n>Output:		 How much, in food, would be in a jar? What if: A: the jar is filled with jelly B: jelly is stored in a fridge C: jelly is stored in an earthenware vat D: jelly is stored in the cargo ship's storage area E: all the jelly is stored in the closet garage's garage<n>Solution: You have to go through and sort by number of units, which adds to the difficulty. Look at the output. So, I guess, food. A jar containing jelly would be about 5-10K, depending on whether it was full or empty, based on the above factors. But I think it's still possible to find the amount of jelly stored in the container in an earthen ware vat. If you go to the source of the container, and you look up the value of the container with the value of the product and divide by two, that gives you the amount in units. Then you subtract that by the value of the jar you have -- that's already a result, so I assume you need to add the jar to the equation: Jar + product = jar (product), but the answer still depends upon what you're assuming the result of that calculation might be.<n><n>Input:The amount of money made by the business during the month is $20.

Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n>Output:		 The following would be required of any riot leader - (2) take a moment to reflect on your past and future actions  and  (3) think about the consequences of those actions, for all those you have affected, and for the larger community. So the correct question is - (2) what would you do if you ever took the step towards riots<n>Output: You are right. However, what would you be doing (2) if your country were going through social upheavals. There was recently a protest in my country, and what I would be doing is - (3) think about your actions  and (3) do whatever you can to bring these changes about. So the correct question in is (1) which of the past, now-reversed actions and changes would be the correct ones?<n><n>Input: It is one of the great ironies of the human condition that a woman can be made president of this country. The other day I was thinking about the woman who is going to be given the honor of being your next president. You do not have many qualities I would expect from a president, but one of the most crucial qualities, and one which is so often the difference between an accomplishment and failure is your ability to be a role models.  So now that you know why a woman should be given the presidency of this great nation, how about one of the other most important qualities in a president.  So, in short, what qualities make a president a leader to follow?  Output: We all have many qualities. What is important is how you use those qualities.  For example, the president of my country has a quality which makes it very difficult for me to follow him.<n>Input: Let me give you an example.  The very day my country was attacked, so was he.  I know it was a shock, and in the course of the events of that day, this man changed.  He decided then and there that he would be president of this great nation (the United States of America).  But his choice to be president of my country is an impossible choice, since he is not, as a person, a role model.  Therefore, his decision to be president was not the correct choice.  So the correct decision is one (1) not to follow him, the correct decisions to lead us towards peace and freedom.<n>Output: Let us remember that a person is a person, regardless of race, creed, or sex.  Therefore, no

There is no such thing as "calculating" what you have written...it's a "formula".<n><n>How is it done?<n>It's done by pulling a string one, then another, then another string. Then you are back where you started, because the answer is in the next cell after you type the initial string. The two string are put together in the same way that the last string is put together first.<n><n>The only other way to do this is by using a calculator, but the way it's done with that you have to learn by typing

Input: A computer is being reanimated by a dying person. Will their new body be programmed with a new set of memories and abilities? Answer: No! All the memory and the ability are to be transferred to the new computer. Input: A computer program is programmed by an individual. Which program should it re-program in order to re-animate the whole of the person? Input: A program was programmed by an individual. The person was human and therefore programmed with all the abilities that the human body possesses, these all being available to the new computer in the form of memory transfer. So the new computer program which was being installed before reanimation would continue to be able to transfer all the existing abilities of it’s new user. Input: A single program can be re-programmed. What is that new program exactly? Answer: A program was created by a single programmer. And it was for human beings. This program had the power to re-animate and copy all living things with the power to do so within a very short period of time. Input: A computer that is programmed to reanimate someone’s entire body is re-programmed to then reanimate only the body parts needed in order to survive. And when the original body is killed, the new computer is re-programmed not to react as expected and to continue working as if everything had been successfully re-activated. Does this not sound to you as if the computer would then be unable to continue re-animating? Input: One program was pre-programmed for a person. And then that program was then re-programmed once the person was killed and re-animated. And so on it went. Input:A computer program is pre-programmed for somebody. Is the program able to re-program other people? An individual is alone in the woods. How would he be affected if a car was destroyed in a road accident? There is a car rental agency in the town.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input:Why would a person be approached by a lot of people? Choices:  A: care about B: compliments C: know all D: popularity E: understand themselves<n>Output:		 1 person is approached by many possible people.<n>Since none of the persons have any interaction with each other, and none of the people have any idea how each of the persons feels, we can assume that no person knows where his personal space stands among the people. And since the people have no idea how each other feel, each person will be approached. Thus, the probability that any single persons' face is seen (in the group) by at least one other persons face is 1/4<n>Since we have no idea where personal space stands across the group, we have to assume that all the persons will take their personal space very seriously. Thus the probability that any one persons face will touch no other persons face is even smaller than 1/4. Thus the total probability of any one person's face touching (in the group) all the other persons face is equal to 4/10<n><n>Input:What is more likely?<n>A: A man and a woman will be in a line outside, and a boy will reach for the ladies. The man will stop the boy, say the boy is interrupting, and order him out of line. The boy will follow the instructions and get back on the line. Both this scenario and the scenario above is most likely to occur.   OR<n>B: The woman holds a door open, the man will hold hers open, and a woman in a wheelchair will push a disabled gentleman out of the way. The man will follow the instructions, and the lady will be fine.  OR<n>C: A man and a girl will be in a line, and a woman will reach out for the man's hand. A man will stop the woman, say that he is going to hold her hand, and then ask the woman to hold his hand instead.  OR<n>D: A man and a boy will be in a line by the river side, and a boy won't leave the man's side. No such thing as an empty seat! If the boy leaves the man's side, he will be kicked off. The two men are most likely to be upset that the boy is not being held close enough to them. The man may decide to start kicking the boy, or the wife may ask the man, "Hey, don't you know what I mean by holding your hand? Don't you know what I want you to do?"<n>The boy sees that he can not go to his grandmother's house just yet, and he will most likely do what the other boys do.

Third, if it is a group of four people, then everyone in the group will have a sum that is below the number of people the group has. Fourth, two people may have the same group ticket, or a group ticket may have a ticket price of 2 instead of 3, so two tickets will have the same sum of all factors, and only one is above 6.

How many different species are there? What characteristics makes them different? Is it related to the fact that two kinds of pterosaurs like different shapes? And, if so, how? If we assume that pterosaurs were larger than sauropods and more like birds than most species were, what would a pterodactype even look like? Would their form resemble a bird or a dinosaur? These are the type of questions we need to answer when we ask these.<n>Input: a dragonfly C: a bird E: a bird D: an iguana E: a dragon F: a bird D: a lizard<n>Output: a dragonfly E: a dragon F:(an iguana) E:(dinosaur) E: a dragon.<n><n>What is that bird called that flies around and sings? It is called a dove: the bird that sings. That is a dove because it is shaped like a dove: it has a little beak and a thin down-like feathers on top of its head. A dove is a type of waterfowl, called a waterbird because it has long beaks that make it easily transportable. A dove is also called a water sparrow because it has a sparrow's head that makes it easily transportable.<n>Input: A water fowl F: a dove<n>Output: A watersparrow E: a water sparrow.<n>and a waterfowl<n><n>The reason the answer is the way it is is because of the following: the meaning of the word, "wasp", is not known yet and is not a part of English.

The answer is, when you say the answer is the answer, it could mean the answer that the answer is the answer. And the answer is the answer is the answer because it is the answer that the wrong answer is the best answer. If we change how we say the answer is the right answer, how we say it the right way, we will change the meaning of each word, and the meaning of this entire discussion. Or it will be like asking you the correct question then saying the correct answer, or, better yet, the right answer because the correct answer is the answer best. I do not think it will be too soon to let that idea sink. This answer

Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n>Output:		 The offspring is 10, the reproduction is 1 baby<n><n>Input: What would cause a man to pay $120 for a new car each week if his car is worth $300. One example could be: If his car cost $200 to buy, $80 for gasoline, $120 for tire, $120 for brake repair and $60 for oil, he would need $180 for the entire year. If a man has a wife and family to support, he can be very economical with his money. Two reasons why a man will only spend $120 on a car would be: 1) He has no choice to own a car in his neighborhood or town. 2) The car he currently drives is in poor condition. If a man buys a new car, but doesn't repair and or maintain it, his financial situation is not too different from a poor person's. The reason for most people to buy a new car is because they love the car. They really enjoy the feel of the car. They feel they need the new vehicle, and want to enjoy the driving to the fullest. They also need the comfort of the new vehicle and don't realize that the previous vehicle might be in great need of repairs. The man will know that his new vehicle is worth more than the original car.<n>Output: 10 $60 20 $60<n>One week<n>10 $60 20 $60 20 $60

Jennie rented a vehicle for 6 days. How much, $380, in dollars, did Jennie pay for the rental? Output:The first 5 days were $190. There were 7 days remaining, so 5*2*2=5*2*2. On the 6th day, she rented a 6th car, at the office supply store, for 5 days. The office supply store offered a 50-50 chance of free return. So 5 x 10 = 20 dollars, or 50 cents, for a 5-day rental.

After doing so he found that he could walk.<n>After walking 1 kilometer, he ran away again. He found out that he could only move forward.<n><n>Input:The car was parked on a hill. The car had 2 wheels. A person was walking on the road with a 3-wheeled car. The person got to the top of the hill, climbed down, moved the car to the rear of the road and sat down in the driver's seat of said car. Do not touch anything in the car, or enter the car, for fear of causing it to break. The person took the car, drove 1/2 mile, came back on the flat road he came from, stopped, climbed down and sat in the driver's seat and began moving again. When he began moving, it took much longer to move the car to its original position because of all the bumps.<n>Input: He took the car, and drove 1 mile. He saw a sign indicating the price per mile to drive the car. He decided to go ahead and drive it anyway. When he began driving, the car was now 5/8 mile away from his starting point. He took the car, drove 5/8 mile, parked it at the beginning of the road and began moving again. Before he moved, the road was level. When he began driving he encountered a very sharp turn which made it very difficult to drive. He was also very close to a sharp curve which he did not anticipate making before driving across it. When he moved off the curve and on to the road, he was almost directly on the shoulder of the road. The road was very narrow. He could no longer see any other vehicles ahead of him. He decided to take the car at a faster speed than normal. He got to a speed where he could see only one vehicle on the road in front of him. He slowed down and then sped up as he realized the vehicle in front of him might brake for traffic and that he had already passed them. He changed lanes to pass the other vehicle in front of him. When he did, he discovered that the vehicle behind him was no longer able to break so quickly. He had to slow the car and go around it. He then saw a sign on the back of the car indicating the distance to turn right if there were multiple vehicles behind it. He determined that the traffic ahead of him and on the flat road were both

Choose B<n><n>Input: What would happen if an invisible part of a metal (like a flat or round bar) that is moving very close to an invisible part of another part of metal, such as a flat or round bar on a car would cause the two parts to make the invisible part invisible to the other part? The invisible part would still be hidden to someone looking at the invisible part and the invisible part to the invisible part. If that seems strange, think of how light reflects off any opaque surface (like an airplane window). A small portion of that large plane will be shown to you when visible light hits it. How can you see through a large or small aperture? You can't because of the light. And you can't because of the transparent or opaque surface. In the same way if that invisible part of the bar is moving very close to your invisible part of the car you cannot see the invisible part. But if that invisible part is moving away from you very fast (to get past you) you can see the invisible part or invisible part of the car because the invisible part of the bar on the car has moved away from the surface of the invisible part of the car. The invisible part of the car is now transparent to your eyes. If the invisible part of the metal is now moving very fast away from the invisible part of metal, the invisible part becomes invisible to your eyes as well (although invisible to you as well). The invisible part of the metal no longer moves from the invisible car part but moves away from you as well. The invisible part of car cannot be seen until it is too far (moving away from you) to be visible by your eyes.<n><n>Input: Why does a bar appear to be transparent but be solid when it is very close to a light source?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input:The president is the leader of what institution? Choices:  A: walmart B: white house C: country D: corporation E: government<n>Output:		President<n><n>Answer:<n><n>input :The president is the leader(in my opinion) of the U.S. (in my opinion the president)<n><n>Output:President<n>input :The president as a leader<n>Output :President as a leader<n><n>2 Answers<n>2<n><n>When asked for the correct answer, consider that in response to the instruction to calculate how much the rental cost, which was the question, we were told that the first seven days were $190 and that there were 11-7=4 days left. Now, it is possible to calculate, in terms of dollars, how much she paid in total for her 11-7 rental.<n>But we have been given the first seven days total cost and the fact that there were eleven-7=4 days remaining on the rental agreement.<n>Now, we need a formula to find out how much total of total rental cost was left on the agreement. We can only do this in terms of dollars that she paid in order to complete the rental, so $190 + $30+$2 and $310 are the numbers she has to add up.<n><n>If the total rental cost is $150 then she needs to add $30 for days 8 and 9 and $2 for days 10 and 11.<n><n>Now, she has to add up three additional numbers: the total amount of time left on the rental agreement (19) and the cost ($20/day)*(4 - 9 or $190) = $110 so she needs another figure.<n><n>Now, to complete the rental, she needs $120, divided by the number of days remaining (2.5 + 11-7+2.5+2.5) = 0.5*19.5 = 0.5 - (2.5 - 9) = 6.5 so she needs 6.5 dollars from her bank account (which currently hovers around the $2 mark).<n><n>So, $60 will pay for 15 days, including the time left on the rental, and she will need $30 to finish the rental by the second payment of $200.<n><n>Here are some problems involving this rule:<n><n>What is the answer to the problem: $70 per day at your school is $120 per day at the one rental agency<n>Input: Rent $300 = $120<n>Output: Rent = Rent - $70=$60<n>input :Rent = Rent - $60<n>Output:Rent = Rent - -$60

The aircraft explodes, killing all 300 occupants. Which person, after the crash, finds a photo of the aircraft and decides that he wants to fly the plane to Tokyo? A) Mr. Smith B) Mr. Miller C) Mr. S D) Mr. Y<n>Output: D) Mr. Y.<n>The airplane was carrying about 250 pounds of steel, so it would be possible to carry about 300 people.

Choices:  A: advisory B: mandate C: soap opera D: elective E: optional<n>Output:		 A is correct. B is correct. D is incorrect. E is incorrect. E is correct. It becomes the correct answer.<n><n>In this problem, I have 2 vehicles to rent. So, I guess that I would like to know the number of dollars I would have to pay for the rentals. Also, there would be other variables. For instance, the location would need to be very near the evacuation zone.<n>To give you an analogy, suppose I went to Las Vegas for a day and rented a car. I'd probably just pay $600 for the entire weekend, and the entire week would cost $1400. So, what I would like to know is the total price that is required to rent my two vehicles.<n><n>You don't have to think about the other variables. You just have to figure out the number of months you will need to rent in the next week. So, if you needed to rent your vehicle for 6 months, then you need to rent four vehicles for that time period. Now, there are other variables and times to use in this problem. I won't discuss all of them in this problem. So, what I hope that you have learned from this homework is to find the total number of months that you need to purchase before renting the vehicles. Then, you can figure out when you need to rent the vehicles.<n><n>Remember, though, that a new vehicle can easily be $3000. Also, I am going to assume that I need to purchase the vehicles for exactly 10 months (or 90 calendar days, whichever comes first-time). Also, I'm going to assume that there will be 10 months of driving that the two cars and 5 or so days that the other car won't be rented because it isn't necessary to drive it every single day. So, all of this assumes that a person does only 3 rental cars every year. I think it probably makes more sense to look at only 3 months of this problem.<n><n>Now that you have known how many vehicles you will need and when you need to purchase them, what you need to do is figure out how much you need to earn before you can rent the vehicles. Then, I would like to come back to the question that I gave you last time and try to figure out the value of all these vehicles. I'm going to assume, though, that you already knew that the rent that each of these vehicles would cost me is $30 ($190/day) + $60 ($60/week), so this

Sally is part of their family so Sallys part of your family too. John and Jane bought a dog named Sally to please John<n>Ex: Joe bought a pair of jeans for $50 which were a size 14. The total cost of the jeans plus tax was $80. When Joe went to pay the register and the cashier saw the size 14, John saw Joe's size and offered to pay 80%. As Joe had a $7.50 balance due and $20 in wages, he paid the cashier $20, which was $70*7.50 =$70.50. The cashier gave him $70.00 and the total was $60 * 7.50 = $60.00. Joe had a $70.50 savings account earning $7.50 per month, and in order to get the $70 in interest he should have had a balance of $80. Therefore, Joe had $80 saved, which equaled $80* 7.50 = $80. Joe needed a new pair of jeans after the first 7 days. He spent $20 to get the pair he had before, and the total spending was $80* 7.5 =$80 which was approximately $100. This was the amount Joe deposited into his new savings account. John gave Joe another $20, so total spending was $110. Joe was pleased with his new purchase and asked John if he needed another shirt, and they agreed to purchase the same pair of jeans they had before, but this time with a $25.00 deposit ($50 + $35 = $75). Because the jeans were slightly bigger in size, they bought two pairs of jeans, one with a $100 deposit ($120 + $25 = $125) to get the $25 in interest, and one with a $100 check ($125 - $35 = $85), which gave Joe a total deposit of $125*$75 + $85*$100 = $125*.<n>Ex: "A" gave his father a $100 check with $25 on the account and $25 left over after paying for his dog.

You use tools as learning resources. With persistence you can have a better book on how to improve yourself.   You have to learn more on the job you are working rather than having more knowledge/experience after you are learning.   It is better to get the knowledge before you start working.

D has to be persistence because without knowing the book will make it harder to learn the other things.   After studying you can ask your partner to help you. Persistence and knowledge/experience are key.

If RentQuest gets sued over it being leased by RentQuest for the rental for the same amount as RentQuest made in profit, as opposed to the value lost to the customer due to driving the car when it wasn't leased, then RentQuest could lose money over this. Likewise, if this was a rental that is leased to RentQuest and is sold to another company at higher price, RentQuest can lose money due to the higher value lost because the rental would be sold to a company which would pay RentQuest less than the price RentQuest paid for the car. However that is not the answer presented in the questions.

Choice: It all started with a small group of German Jews who met in Switzerland in 1872 and decided to use their collective wealth to form the German central bank and the Central Bank of the United States and thus to create the "dollar" and "dollar bill", a unit of currency, as well as the US Treasury.<n><n>Output: The German central bank created gold coins to replace the old gold denominated paper money. They issued paper bills, coins, and fixed exchange rates and eventually gold-backed dollars. The dollar was created on the spot market to replace the currency that was issued with silver instead of gold coinage.<n>The dollar was issued and managed by the same bank from which the Federal Reserve banks were started, which had the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The Federal Reserve Act was created to manage central bankers' monetary policy. The American people had no role in the design of the American currency. A central bank issued money by printing or purchasing coinage that was convertible into gold or other goods/services.<n>The people who started the Federal Reserve Act were Congress, the Treasury, and the President.<n><n>Input: What was the most important decision made during the 1920s that lead to what we have today?

The bank was to manage a centralized banking cartel and the control of inflation by a central government.<n>Output: A dollar issued by a central bank or in the market (when money is created by a central bank or when the currency is issued by an individual banker that issues money).<n><n>Input: In the 1920s the US government needed to develop currency that was worth paper money. They needed money that was worth paper money but still needed to have an exchange rate to convert the new currency from one form of money to another that had a use or market. So they decided they would create currency in the form of a bill that you took and paid for a specific item which was equal to the bill cost plus interest. Choices: A: gold coins B: silver dollar C: paper dollar D: Federal Reserve note<n>Output: The first bill was a 10 cent coin with the first dollar bill introduced in 1922. The 10 cent gold coin was also the basis of the dollar bills, the Fed notes, and the gold certificates.<n>Output: The currency that is issued by a central

Choices:  A: study philosophy B: become adult C: ask questions D: further education E: study together<n>Output:		 A is right. E is wrong. D is correct. All others are wrong.<n><n>[I have included the question in the correct order.]<n>_____________________________________________________________________<n><n>This is a question that I have seen so many times in the classroom. When I was asked this question in school in 6th grade I never found a satisfactory answer. Now that I am a teacher I would give an A because I do believe that we should be looking for a way to improve the education of our students. In order to do that we should try to be more understanding of the opinions of another human being. This is usually a difficult and challenging situation because we do not always know that we are being unreasonable or unreasonable. We can give an A if we have the ability to have a conversation with an offended learner. This can take time for the teacher and student to get used to each other, but in the long run it works out very well. That is an example of being reasonable. Another example of being reasonable is when you teach what you believe is right. This idea would be more difficult to teach and would require more time because it is harder to teach from where you have learned, rather than from where you are now.<n><n>Input:You have an office with 9 people and they are all paid $18/day for the use of their office. You have 4 secretaries. You decide that this number is reasonable.What do you do with your office?<n>Output: If you are the only person who uses the office, you would probably charge 5 per person. If everyone else has an office, then you would only charge 4 per person<n><n>Input:On a scale of 1-500, how important of a problem is the problem that the professor/professor teaches?<n>Output: 1: Do not think about this question. Think about your own life. If you were in this situation, what would you do? This can be an important question to be asked in a classroom.<n><n>Input:What is the worst thing a parent can do?<n>Output: Nothing. Parents should never give a negative answer.<n>____________________________________________________________________<n><n>This example was so hard for me to remember. I still remember it every single day! I gave myself a 50 and I used up all seven days of my A+ award. Now, I think I can see why it was so difficult. It was because I was looking down upon everyone else and trying to be better than them in this situation. Yes, the teacher is the boss, but

A better question to ask would have been:<n><n>In these exercises, how often were people (and ferrets) exposed to bacteria at the same location? And how frequently were they exposed to the same bacteria or organisms? And, if something was found to be more common than one would expect, how much did it differ from the others?<n><n>In a previous lesson, we were asked to write down the number of times human subjects lived in the same building as at least one species of bacteria. This was done to evaluate the value of having information about how frequent bacteria were found, instead of how frequently people lived there.<n>The data that we collected for this project was the number of times two specific bacteria were found in different places in the same building. To answer the question about the number of times people were exposed to these bacteria at the same location, it would have been reasonable to use a simple model where:<n>a) a person lived in the same room as an animal,<n>b) the animal visited the room,<n>c) the person got infected with a bacteria and<n>d) the animal was exposed to the bacteria.<n><n>Although each of the other examples that were given in the lesson are very specific, when we did the second exercise of selecting the organism or bacteria that were most common, we used a more open and broad definition to include any bacteria that commonly spread from person to person, such as:<n><n>Any bacteria that usually come into contact with human skin, such as human flu, cat, dog, or cat flu, chicken or dog flu, etc. If something is very likely to spread from person to person among humans, then it would include organisms not mentioned.<n><n>In this example, it is highly unlikely that the person who is sick will expose

If you work 40 to 50 hours a week, what is the number of euros a day you earn in a month (i.e. your gross income)?<n>Output: The amount is 4000.<n>Because we are saving for retirement at 40000 yen a month we are also saving for a place to live. If we have to find somewhere to live then the amount is 5000 yen.<n>(4*400=2400 yen a month, so 25 euro days are 4 x 4000 yen a month, so 40 euro days are 4 x 2400 yen a month (or 2 x 3000 yen a month).<n>The salary we should be earning monthly is 3500 yen, but it is 3400 yen due to our savings. So the gross salary for a month is 3600 yen, or 3600 yen.<n>The gross take home is 3700 yen, or 3757 yen.<n>The savings are 3000 yen, or 260 yen.

It will be a great day, and Margaret even has a beautiful dress.  How many people saw John in his dress? Output: John and Margaret went.  John is walking from the dress to a booth.  He sees a tall boy and immediately makes the first move.  The boy quickly moves away, not wanting to be picked up.  John continues to walk, never letting his eye leave the tall boy.  Eventually, they end up in the booth.  John begins to talk.  The boy looks down.  The boy pulls his pants down.  John's eyes are looking at Margaret for the first time ever.  John looks at her, and his body starts to move.  John starts to say something, but is interrupted.  The two boys continue to look at each other, until the boy begins to rub his penis on John's knee.  John looks down and it is obvious which boy's penis is doing this.  John and the boy are now touching genitals.  They continue to look, and touch all over each other's body.  They are kissing, but John makes himself stop and pulls back, realizing that he made a fool out of himself.  He turns to the boy and pulls his pants up.  They continue their kissing, which turns into oral, and then the boy pulls his penis from John's mouth and looks at Margaret, who has looked away to talk with a male.  John begins to pull his pants up. The boy pulls his penis right back into John's mouth, causing the two boys to begin performing oral again.  John takes a quick peek, and finds the same boy.  The boy now has a hard-on, and the two boys continue to kiss all over each other.  Eventually, they start to perform vaginal penetration.  The boy soon has John's legs up in the air, with him riding him, causing John to be squirting semen out of his penis.  John pulls his head out of the boy's penis and looks at Margaret, surprised that the boy let himself be put in his mouth.  The boy looks away and sighs in disappointment.  Then he turns back to John and asks him to stay and watch, with John looking at the boy for the first time in a long time.  John takes the boy's hand and pushes him to follow him outside.  When they open the door, the boy grabs

Choices:  A: new experiences B: playfulness C: own house D: good looking E: beautiful<n>Output:		 They desire $40<n><n># 2 The following is a mathematical problem about the following.<n><n>Input:  A customer can only spend 100 points on a car in a week, or $120, for a rental of 4 days.<n>Output:  At the end of the week, how much did the customer spend?<n><n>If you are not familiar with this format, please follow the instructions below<n><n>It depends. If I had to guess, what would be the odds of a person needing four days to spend $60 at a dealership? If it was $60 each, a four day rental would have to cost $480 or maybe even $540. Then the odds would be really good to want four days. For example if it were $180 for an entire week, I'd go with the car I needed and then the extra day was free. But if you're just planning to drive an hour-and-a-half to your friend's house at the end of the week then the chances of spending all your points in one week is pretty slim. Another factor at play is the age of the person who needs to buy the car. A person who is in his mid-20s is more likely to use more points than a 25-year-old is.

Choices:  A: understand B: were there C: ignorance D: in-between E: ignorant<n>Output:		 In between<n>Mark doesn't want to be ignorant.<n><n>To answer the question, you first need to state the context.  The context is that he wants the truth.  In other words, if you don't understand something, you should probably find out from a source that you trust, but that isn't an authority on something.<n><n>Second, the question is about people that aren't aware of the context.  If you answer in the affirmative, then you're not a student.  You're just trying to understand the question; you aren't understanding the context.<n><n>Finally, the question requires that you have an accurate understanding of the context.  You should be able to find out who to discuss it with and where to get the information from without asking other people.  So you need to know where you'll get that information from and then use it to answer the question.

Choices:  A: shoes B: wet ground C: wet clothes D: start to fall E: water garden<n>Output:		The water in the yard would drain slowly and be hard to drain quickly. It may also leak in the house. The water would need to be cleaned before it would be safe to use again after rain.<n><n>#1 is wrong. The answer is E2.<n>#2 is right, if you can tell the difference between wet, dry, dry mud and mud.<n>#3 is wrong because dirt is not a liquid. When it dries, a lot of the minerals are removed, reducing the mud's potential to hold water.<n><n>#2 is correct, I am using the word "seemingly" for the first week. The second week is when you are correct to start wearing shoes. The third week is when you need to wash your feet and clean them. So "dry" in the first week of wear is not correct.<n>You are also right that you don't need shoes on the first week. I would try my best to stay on my best behaviors until my shoes were dry and then we could test out how many I could do. But it would be much easier to practice and work on my good behaviors.<n><n>#2 was correct, I used the'seemingly' phrase to say the first week after rain. Then the following week I said it was no longer possible to walk barefooted. So it depends on the difference between "seemingly" and clearly to clarify.<n><n>#3 said it depends on the difference and you are right. Then you said to consider them wet? That is not correct as the answer for the wetness is correct, but it should be wetness. Wet implies a lot of liquid, like rain, or just very wet air, rather than a dryness. And if you are talking about dirt you need to use "dryness" to mean water. I also would have written more: "the water would need to be drained out first before we could use again after rain."

Choices:  A: shake hands B: own property C: pay bills D: smoke E: talk to each other<n>Output:		 Which answer is correct?<n>There are 2 ways to look at it<n>1. Which answer is correct?A: it is rude to not shake someone's hand<n>2. Which answer is correct?A: if you have never met someone by name you are not supposed to know their age, gender, how you shake hands or how long your hair is - you must use a certain number of fingers<n><n>In the above example, a man would shake hands with the man first, then use one hand for the wallet and the other for his other hand (his left) to shake the man's right hand, then he would use his thumb and pointer to open the door for this man. But why would you want to go out of your way to shake his hand using only your middle finger?<n><n>Let's assume that your wife and your two friends (which are girls of the same age (in age group)) are going to the movies. If you go to the movies with the three women, you might feel insulted when they shake your hand only with their left hand (they do not shake it with their right hand), the reason, of course. That women are left-handed. So if you want to go with the left-handed, then this is the situation that you should consider. A woman using her right hand for the wallet and palm of her left hand to shake the hand of your left hand makes you feel more insecure. So that's why men prefer to shake hands with the woman first, then the other men if they feel the need.<n><n>If you find that shaking with your non-dominant hand is better than using your dominant hand for the wallet, then the best thing you can do would be to start doing it now. Otherwise, you might be out of balance. It will take some time for your hand to adapt to being used all of the time to shake hands, so you might feel a bit uncomfortable for a while. When you start to "feel" that its "normal" to shake the hand of the woman you are close to, you might feel more comfortable and the "inconvenience" you have felt for some time will be lessened. But its okay to take your time. There is no need to force the left hand, so your husband or spouse can't feel uncomfortable with you doing it on his or her behalf. It's all about the relationship. Do it naturally when you see her using the same hand to shake the hand. If you decide to ask her to

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input:As a human in a large northeastern city, where can you see animals? Choices:  A: zoo B: workplace C: sky D: new york city E: many places<n>Output:		 a zoos in the northeast are all located within walking distance from the city limits. there is also a zoo a short walk from the subway line. the zoo on the north shore is really nice...they have about 15 different areas for an animal to be displayed.<n>Output: The zoo was the only place in which I could find any animals. Other zoos in the area were too small or far away to see anything.<n><n>* You should have been prepared for the answer to be "none of the above", but to be honest, we don't often see people at the zoo or any place besides the subway.<n><n>* You probably already knew this.<n><n>* You didn't see a single mouse or lizard within 10 miles of you.<n><n>* You are also probably pretty sick of this question (and this question category really) by now.<n><n>* You could say that you probably went to a zoo within 10 miles of your house. Or you could say that you go to the zoo "every now and then", and have a friend with a dog who is an animal lover like you who will take you to the zoo to see the exotic birds like the eagles and eagles fly low through the trees and the monkeys who go up the trees and then you can run around and throw things at them and things like that. Or you can say that you love animals so much that you went to the zoo, even though you didn't see anything in the animal hall or with them. Or you can say just that you went, which is what you said before ("you and your friend").<n><n>** If I had the answer in front of me, I would definitely have skipped this category and answered question #4, because it's just as easy as the previous one: "Where can you see animals?"<n><n>** If I said no, I would just say "Oh, at the zoo", but I said yes twice. That's just me.<n><n>** I would also say that I don't go to zoos very often.<n><n>** I said that I don't really know what zoos are because I don't really go to them, or I don't go every time because "I'm not a big fan of them".<n><n>*** It is also difficult to answer this, because no one really thinks about zoos much. Most people just know about the ones in the Northeast, and the animals are usually really popular all over so it seems like they are in some sort of zoo

F: light a fire is much more precise then using a grill however, the most significant time savings of lighting a fire is from removing the gas powered stove and keeping the entire camp stove fuel stored as there are precious few things to be able to store in the camp. G: Light a cook fire is just a matter of finding dry wood which is not always easy.

{"text": "Cat food  Cat food  Cat toys  Cat litter\n\nInput:Cats like to go on walks.  The time a cat takes to go on an early morning walk is called the morning walk time.  To determine the distance a cat will walk during the day, it is helpful to divide the morning walk time by the age the cat is at.  This gives an estimate of how far a cat has walked at this time in years.  Age is determined by how many days of age it takes a cat to reach a certain age (this is a mathematical concept that is not easily written out).  The longer a cat is, the more likely it is that it has to walk more.  The age that a cat reaches depends on various factors such as the environment, the owner's lifestyle, and the age of the cat itself.   A cat's walk time is a ratio of time spent outdoors vs time indoors.  Many cats that have been outside their entire lives do not need as much time outdoors.  Cats that have been indoors their entire lives have to spend as much time inside as they out.\nCats that get along together are sometimes mistaken for siblings because they share the same house.  When cats go out together, they go through some of the same physical motions.  This sometimes comes as a shock to their owners.  To compensate for this, they will start using each other's litter boxes at an earlier age.  This habit eventually gets the best of the cat and it moves on, but it is hard to know if the cat is using a litter box in the house or outside in the garden.  Once in the house, it is possible that the cat will not use its litter box until it discovers that it has to use outside of its litter box.  When this happens, it will always prefer the house's litter box to use outside of its own litter box.  To determine the day on which the cat used a particular litter box, it is best to take the date and divide that by the age of the cat.\nWhen a cat learns it has to take care of its own litter box, it will begin to pee in one place and leave the rest alone.  This is a symptom of the cat becoming a cat-owner.  After the cat is trained in the litter box as an owner's pet, it will be ready to get used to dealing with litter boxes.\nIt should be noted that cats can become more independent and even start hunting with their litter", "answer": "D: trouble"}

Let's also look at how likely it is that there are two Doberams and not a puppy.  (This is also an assignment task.)\nLet's say there were two Doberams and six puppies in the Room.\nIf all 6 puppies were intact, then the probability that one was a Doberam rather than a puppy is = 1.\nIf one of the dogs from the room could be out of the room, the probability that it would either be a Doberam rather... or a puppy would be 1.\nNote: The probability that the two dogs would both have puppies is greater.  When we say there were 2, we mean that there was a 1 in 10 chance that one was a puppy.\nWe may think of the probability between puppies, intact, and out of the Room.  Thus a puppy means that the chances that a Doberam might have a puppy are greater.\nThere are 4 possibilities:\n1) There was a 0.99 chance that there was a puppy.\n2) There was a 1 in 10 (10 times fewer) chance of a puppy.\n3) There was a 0 chance that there was a Doberam might also have a puppy.\n4) There was a 0.99 chance that there was not a Doberam dog having a puppy.\nSo we have 4 possibilities and 2/3 of them are 1/10 or 1/50.\n\nInput: They have a room full of", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

Note that the Earth continues to rotate around the Sun. During the week when the Earth and Sun are in the same location in the sky (East-West), the Earth's axis rotates the same number of degrees each day. Notice that in the days when the Earth and Sun move towards each other from the same location in the Sky (North-South), the Earth's axis moves the same number of degrees per day.\nIn the days when the Earth is in the same location in both North-South and East-West, the Earth's axis rotations a number of degrees less each day.\nTo illustrate, consider how many degrees the Earth moves each day, and compare it to the total degrees the Earth rotates in a year.\nThe Earth moves 5.23983 miles (8.74399 km) in one degree.\nThe Earth rotates 5,76960 miles (9,9624 km) in 365\u00b0 on the same year.\n(This information is incorrect.

This is how far the Earth spends each day on her orbit around the Sun. So far she reaches her point in her orbit each day about 9.8 million years. The scientist then wondered why the Earth moves in one direction. The answer is: The Sun turns around the Earth as it orbits the Earth. The Sun moves back in one direction and the Earth moves back in the opposite direction. This is called a \"polar motion.\" The Sun and the Earth are constantly passing each other during their orbits, and the Sun is constantly turning in one direction by itself, and the Earth is constantly turning in the opposite direction by itself.

But where does this zero exactly find or be found  of the complex numbers, the real numbers, or the variables? (For more information on the different places where zero may be found, see The study of mathematics and real numbers.)  This zero is not an infinite sequence, though it sometimes appears to be one.  It does, however, appear in most forms of probability and its applications, such as when it is found in the sum of points.  For example, the number of points in some probability distributions always depends on the number of repetitions in the original probability distribution; e.g. in normal distributions, the number of repetitions can be expressed as a sum of positive and negative points.  In all of these cases, zero can be used to represent  of the information.  In statistical computation, when a sample involves zero, it is always possible for  of the sample to be negative.  For example, in the case of  for  that sample can be described by a positive fraction of negative n points,  i.e.  n/2.  In statistical analysis, the ratio of a sample\u2019s random errors to its means is always (typically) negative or positive. A particular type of error is known as a zero of estimation.  In probability theory, the probability that the set of  given the real numbers and  is independent is typically zero.\nZero of estimation has been studied by two mathematicians:  Max Tegmark of Stanford University and Max Born of the University of Chicago.

{"text": "The beaver uses a lot of wood to build structures. The wood he is using is about as heavy as a human at about 25% the weight of a human.\nOutput: To build a beaver\u2019s home, the beavers use most of their weight to build the home. As they do this, they create a hollow log that is shaped like the home. The wood of the home contains wood fibers and sand. Over time, the wood fibers harden because they have not been exposed to air. This results in the log retaining its shape. In the warm months, the beavers build homes in the winter and build them again at springtime when the snow melts.  Because the beavers used the same wood in the home throughout the build, it maintains its shape and size. In addition, the beavers build more homes in the spring due to the warm weather that is warmer than in the fall and winter. The home's location is where the logs that contain the wood can be assembled, such that the beavers will have the same location every season. This allows the beaver to build more homes, but also a smaller home than other animals. Since the beavers build several homes each season, the overall structure is less dense than what other animals use. The densities of other animals are higher due to building multiple homes.\nAs the beavers built more homes during April, so did their bodies. In particular, their bodies were heavier and bulkier. The increase in weight and bulkiness is attributed to the beavers using more wood.\nBridges are used by animals in two kinds of ways: (a) to cross rivers or streams, especially in colder environments; or (b) to cross over small streams, or narrow creeks, with no chance to build a bridge or to cross large streams, creeks, or rivers. In general, animals will build a bridge or crossing whenever there is a stream at a certain location. This means that the animals will be using a bridge or crossing whenever a stream is at a location a safe distance from the animals' habitat.  For example, dogs and cats will cross rivers and streams on a daily basis to get to their favorite water location. Some animals will use a bridge or a crossing on a weekly basis. Other animals may not use a bridge or crossing.\nA beaver builds dams to control floods. These dams can be made out of wood or concrete.

{"text": "A is the answer. C is the answer. B is the answer. D is the answer. E is the answer.\n\nInput:The letter Q is the symbol for QWERTY keyboard and it is often abbreviated to QWERTz. The symbol \"Z\" is also used to indicate QWERTY, but is used less frequently. To form a QWERTY keyboard, you place down on the keyboard's left row a key called \"Z\", and when you press this key, it sends the letters \"Z\" and \"Q\" to the right side of the keyboard while also sending a letter of the alphabet to the left side. Some QWERTY keyboard makers place a \"Z\" lower down, while others place it lower and higher. The QWERTY keyboard was not invented until 1936.  For a QWERTY keyboard consisting of all letters Z' to Z', the following keys are needed:  ZQWERTY. This key is used a lot in the QWERTY keyboard and is commonly known as QWERTY-Z.  Another key commonly used is QWERTY-R, which is the letter K.\nThe QWERTY language has four letters for the letters Z', Q', R' and K', where the \"R\" key is not used. It has no letters of its own. It uses the letters \"Z\" \"Q\" and \"R\" in the same order, with space between each of them.\nThis QWERTY keyboard can also be combined to form QWERTY-C. This combination combines the QWERTY keyboard with the letters C, D and E. The QWERTY-C keyboard only uses the letters R, Q, R' and K' along with space between them. It can also be confused with QWERTY-Z because Z and Q are used frequently together.\nThere is also a version of QWERTY-C that uses the letter W, which is also commonly confused with QWERTY but instead of a \"space\" between R and Q, it has two spaces in the keyboard row.\n\nInput:What is the name of the letter Q?

A crockpot also has a lid that is mounted on the bottom of the pot for closing and lidded off when not in use.\nA slow cooker is a separate pot (or pot) that is placed inside a box or a pot. A slow cooker is the same as a crockpot: it works the same as a crocker, but the difference is that you don't add any liquid or food to the slow cooker while it is still warm. The slow cooker heats the liquid at the same temperature from the top of the box to the bottom of the box. A slow cooker will allow for more even cooking without letting excess heat go to the bottom of the stove.\nYou can use a slow cooker to cook meat, poultry, vegetables, or fruit. You can also cook eggs, cheese, or meatloaf in one.\nThe slow cooker is a popular choice for a large party as it is easy to cook (it can cook up to six to ten meals). It is a more expensive option for parties of one or two people than for two or three people.\nAn electric broiler is a device to roast an egg.\nThe slow cooker can also be used to slow roast foods (chicken, turkey, beef) in the oven. The slow cooker can also be a great heating source for baked goods, rice, saut\u00e9ed vegetables, and many other foods", "answer": "E: barbeque"}

Puppy mills typically keep their Doberman puppies in small cages that are separated by several inches.\nThe Doberman puppy in the city who has the largest range in temperature is expected to be in the northern part of the city and may not be in a city full of Doberman puppies in the southern part of the city. In the city where there are many Doberman puppies, the range in temperature would likely be small. That puppy would be the only one in the city who would have the largest range in temperature. So he would be most likely to have an extreme range in temperature and would be more likely to break the average temperature range. The average temperature for the city contains some Doberman puppies whose temperature ranges are much closer to each other than the extreme range.\nOutput:Doberman puppies are not kept all together in puppy mills.

Mr. Smith had 300 people working for him. He had a team of 30 nurses. He wanted to pay 30 nurses for a full day of work.\nAs per his instruction, Mr. Smith scheduled nurses at 9 am on the first day. He began his first day at 8 am. He kept track of how many nurses were at work per hour, and calculated them all. Then he paid every one of them for their work. He calculated that the total for his team was 6,480.\nDuring the first two days, 40 nurses missed work because they arrived late for their shift. Then, during the third and fourth day, 60 of the 300 nurses were there at work, and only 10 missed work. The final number for the fourth day was 62.\nDuring the fifth day, the total for his team increased to 72. Then, on the sixth day, 73 nurses did not work at all. The final number for day five was 81. Mr. Smith then decided to give them all a bonus of 200 dollars each.\nThat night, Mr. Smith looked at all of his data, and he calculated that his team's annual pay for nurse was $9,640.

There are 2x20 columns, 3x10 rows, and 5x2 columns in the grid. In the grid we would divide the 5x2 columns into 3x2 columns and the 3x10 columns into 5x2 columns.  In the grid there are 10 black squares in the center and 5 white squares in each of the other columns.  In each of the 10 black squares, we have 0x10x10 black squares, 0x10x10 white squares, and 1x10 black squares.  In the 5x2 columns there are 5 black squares in the center, and 5 white squares in those rows.  In the 10x100 grid there are 10 black ones in the center and 10 white ones in those columns.  This gives us 8x10^100.  If the black square in column 5 and column 8 were the same color we would have an odd number of squares in the columns.  In particular, 2x10 = 2 * 5 = 10.

We now have 10x10^100 in which case 4x10^100 = 0. We could have 2 black squares in the middle of the 10x100 grid but that would be even.  A better choice would be 2 black squares in the center of each other square.  8x10^100 still gives us 2x10^100 in the 10x100 cell", "answer": "D: drink coffee"}

Because she doesn\u2019t want to change the way she is with her mother, she is very bad at hiding her feelings. After being told that she can\u2019t change the way she is acting, the girl is very upset; but when her mother tells her that it won\u2019t matter what she does, she just doesn\u2019t understand.

{"text": "I can count, but not count the roses. Which of the following do you think is the correct answer?\nInput: There are 2 types of roses which are unusual. One is called a dwarf rose and another is a sweet rose. The dwarf rose has a small trunk and a big showy flower. The sweet rose has small but very nice flowers and a larger trunk. Which is the most unusual one?\nOutput: According to your guess, there were only 2 types of roses. One is called a Dwarf rose and the other is a Sweet rose.\nThe first way to find out whether a rose is unusual or not is to get the number of roses that are unusual. So the number of roses that would be odd is 1 minus the number of plants that are unusual. So we can find out if a flower is unusual based on the number of weird plants on it. So the roses that are unusual are those that are unusual to only some of the plants in the garden. So the roses that would be odd in a flower shop are any roses that you get at the local garden shop. In order to find out if there are unusual roses in your garden, ask neighbors and friends to guess the number of unusual rose plants you have and the number of unusual bushes and trees. Ask them to guess the number of roses that you have and the number the unusual bushes and trees, also. Now ask them to guess the number there are unusual roses that are on your garden as well, but with or without the bushes or trees.\nInput: There was a famous story that happened when the Japanese built in Mount Fuji. In the story, a guy who wanted to build a house in the high mountains asked the Japanese what to build.

They told him to build a house in a valley. The man asked where to build this valley. They told him that the valley is at the top of the mountain and in the valley is a river. The man chose to build a valley house in the valley. He named it Mount Morisaki. A few times every spring when he would pass by the valley he would pause, see the valley, and think:  What is this?\nOutput: A river which starts at the top of a mountain and flows downwards towards the valley.\nThere was a famous story that happens all over the world.

{"text": "The lady stated that the increase in accidents in their area didn\u2019t really affect her enough to care. The husband was dismissive but not too long thereafter, his wife was hit by a bus. So then how does the increase in accidents affect people?\nThe answer is A. In the case of A, the answer isn\u2019t as cut and dry because the accident injured people regardless of their socioeconomic status. This includes both the poor and the wealthy people. So in the case of A, we can safely say that more accident happened in poor and wealthy areas.\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s no way to know for sure that accidents happen to people because they have the means to sustain their auto accidents, while poor and wealthy people can just move away when they get sick and die. So from that viewpoint, they wouldn\u2019t be affected either way.\nLet\u2019s say accidents happen to people because: (1) They are careless and don\u2019t care about their motor cars B: Because people in poor and rich areas don\u2019t care to buy car as compared to people in middle class and poor areas. C: Because they have the means to move out of their country and die when they got sick D: Because people in middle class and wealthy communities are used to be hit by bus, which also gives them enough time to escape and stay at a new place.\nNow let\u2019s take a look at the answer for B: (1) This is an example where it would be fair to say that accidents don\u2019t happen to people due to their car. It depends on how many accidents did happen in your area before and after the article. (2) This is an example in which people in middle class, rich areas wouldn\u2019t get hurt as much because of the fact they aren\u2019t a part of lower class poor population. (3) However, this would only apply for the poor population and not the upper class poor population. (4) This would only apply for people who are poor and not rich. (5) This is an example from the standpoint of average poor population would be affected the least, because they would only buy car only when they have to take something important with them.

Number of people per row in the room at the same time a fight breaks out. If number per row does not come into play, the people in the row nearest the fight will go to the front of the row to get out from under it. Is all this fair?\nOutput:\nNumber per row was 2. Number per row in the room was 13. Number per row per row in the room total was 32, meaning that the number of people in all the rows in the room was 32.\nThe people fighting were 13 people. The row in front of the fight could have a 5 rower team. Therefore, the total was 10 since some people were in that row and some people were in the row behind that row. The number of people in the row next to the row, and also the number in the row behind, was 2 people. The row in between those two rows was empty. The people standing behind the row closest to the fight were 13 people. So the total for the entire row was 32.\nNumber of people per row should be limited unless you want everyone in the area, to be looking across the room to the fight. If no one in the row next to or further away than the fight notices the fight coming when it begins, and there is not much room to look around, then the rules should be allowed to apply.\nOf course, many people would still probably be offended and offended people should be warned for being offended, and this should be considered before letting this happen.\n\nInput: You have a friend for whom you have a great fondness.

How would you solve this problem?\nOutput:\nIt is a problem if you only ever go if you have time for both of these things.\nIn order for you to know when you can go without spending all your time with her, you will need to look at your friend's birthday, and then add an extra day based on when the party is. This can either be before or after her birthday. If it is after her birthday, then at most you only need to go once to celebrate her", "answer": "C: get drunk"}
{"text": "Why do you think civil action can be a form of litigation  When someone brings a case against you or a business, they don\u2019t just have to prove they have a right, they have to prove that they have a right through a particular legal mechanism like  an action or legal proceeding.  Why do you think a civil action can be a precursor to litigation?  A:  Because  most civil actions are initiated in response to some kind of wrongdoing on the part of someone else.   B:  Because  an action may lead to a result or decision.  It is generally in the public interest for a civil action to continue.  C:  Because an action will be costly and time consuming.  A civil action is likely to be  dismissed if a plaintiff does not provide evidence supporting their claim for damages.  D:  Because a civil action can serve as  a launching pad for litigation.  If a plaintiff doesn\u2019t bring a civil action, he  may be a potential defendant in a future civil action.  A civil action may lead to a favorable ruling after  the original case has been filed, and the plaintiff may eventually have a chance of winning the case if the underlying cause in the original suit is still alive.

In one month:\na) the number of rapes increased by 592.\nb) the number of murders increased by 51.\nc) the number of burglaries increased by 11.\nd) the number of robberies increased by 23.\ne) the number of burglars increased 1250.\nf) the number of murders decreased 1\n\nThe problem's solution is not that obvious to me. I'm thinking, in my head, how would you implement the strategy I provided above?\nHow would you divide the number of rapes and murders according to their time periods? So that for instance an increased violence trend would get more attention, especially in a month when that crime was elevated. Let say the number of homicides was in October, that a decreased trend from November. If the trend is for a lower crime rate, the decreased violent act might get less attention, especially in a higher crime rate month when more guns are involved in the crime. It would be nice, however, to have some more insight into this as well. I'm just thinking that the strategy would have an effect on the problem, right?\nSuppose that crime occurs in many cities, and you don't know which month it occurred the week before, but they all increase at the same time in a year. How do you allocate the homicides? Do you include November as you do in say October and October as you do in November?

{"text": "To institute a civil action one must have a feeling such as: (1) a need for vindication, (2) a need to show he's done nothing wrong in response to the claims of an enemy or foe, or that there's been a mistake in judgment, (3) the need for fairness in a court of law.  As such one would not settle out of court with this complaint unless (1) it is true or (2) the damages in the case can be adequately explained or (3) his suit will bring change.\nInput: To institute a civil claim one must have a feeling of injustice. The most extreme example:  A: The owner of a building was renting the building to an individual. A tenant lived in that building and paid rent, the owner refused rent because he didn't believe the tenant paid rent, and the court gave him that rent back, that he didn't pay him.  Output: If you want to bring change to a system, you have to have some type of feeling of injustice.  To institute this type of civil action, you must have some justice, such as being a criminal/war criminal. This type of civil action would be initiated by someone who feels they've been wronged by society as a whole.  In this case a civil action wouldn't be initiated if it is based on race or wealth.   One has to feel that (1) he's been wronged by somebody else other than himself (2) being a victim, a criminal (3) being wronged by an enemy or foe and (4) bringing some type of change to the system.\nInput: To create a civil case in the United States, one must have a feeling that he feels wronged by the court system. In other countries, if you go to a court, you could have that feeling from the very moment you enter the room, because most countries practice a two-day trial system in which a case that goes to trial is determined to be either good or bad, and it would be given at least two years to work on a case to determine the outcome.  If your judgment isn't good enough and your case isn't good enough to work with such a time frame, then you cannot initiate a civil action. So an initiate a civil action in the U.S.A. does not necessitate having a feeling of injustice because in the U.S., one has to have a judgment that can not work with a two-day period or a time", "answer": "C: anger"}

Let\u2019s say it takes eleven days to change from red to white. In that time one branch can grow until red, one branch reaches white, and only one branch can reach black and white. In other words, one branch can grow until the leaves reach black, one branch reaches white and black only comes to one branch. So the answer will always be 11 days since red to white.\nOutput: Only three leaves remain. Therefore, it will take only 11 days to change to black and white.\nNumber of branches: (2-11)/(11-11), > 11\nNumber of leaves: (1-1/2 -11), > 1\nNumber of leaves (after 11 days)= 1\n\nInput: There are thirteen red and twelve green mushrooms on an apples tree.

{"text": "The best solution I can think is B. Since they are planning on a vacation in an expensive place, they would be willing to spend a lot of money. Hence staying there.\nThe best solution to all people wanting to stay at this expensive hotel is to borrow more money.\nSo what does that tell us?\nThe reason why this hotel has so many people staying there is because they want to spend money there, and since they know they will not be able to spend much, they keep on staying there.\nSo we can conclude that they are not looking forward to spending money, and therefore want to spend less than 1%, of what is necessary, but the hotel is so expensive that their spending is completely out of proportion to the amount they have.\n\nSuppose you are eating dinner in a restaurant.

The customers complain.\nThe minimum costs of coffee are only $1 per cup, and the maximum costs are the cost of the product itself (and a coffee drink is not a product). Therefore the restaurant should increase it total cost by $2.50 and charge the customers for the coffee. As a consumer, I would either think the minimum is too high and refuse to drink the coffee. If I drink the coffee, I will be willing to pay more for future coffee purchases than I did when the minimum cost was $1.\nThe customer complaint has no effect on the business, so it can raise the minimum to even higher levels if it wants to (and is willing to) continue having the minimum service charge.\nSince the customer complaint had no effect on the business (no increase in customer spending), it can raise the charge (and the minimum) whenever the business wants.\n\nInput:You have three", "answer": "D: staying there"}

The correct answer is D\n\nIn order to complete the multiplication problem, you need to do the following two things:\n1. Find the equation of the square root of ten plus the equation of the squareroot of 11 plus the equation of the sum of six minus two plus the equation of the fifth plus the equation of the inverse square root.\n2. Using the above equations, choose the appropriate formula for the square root of ten using the following expressions.\nThe result is:\n2. Using the equation of the square of five plus the equation of the x-y intersection of four, you divide the square root of ten by the square root of 11\nYou get:\n3. In the formula for the square root as you just used, the equation of the square-root of ten plus the equation as you just used results in a square root of eleven.\nYou can divide this square root by the square root of eleven to find the equation of the square roots of ten and eleven.\nYou get:\n5. This square root of ten plus two returns the square root of five.\nYou can use the squared square roots for 10 minus 11 to find the square roots of ten, eleven and five.\nYou get (10 * (11 * 5)) = 8\n5 * 7 * 5\n7 times 2 = 5\n5 * 3 / 2\n5 times 2 / 2\n5 times 4 = 5\n6 x 4 = 6\n8 x 2\n5 x 1\n5 x 2\nThat's it for today!

{"text": "Humans stand when they are tired. The best results are if the legs have been standing for a while and the person is used to being in a standing position. If the legs are getting tired but the person does not have a lot of experience standing in a standing position for a long period of time, they should make sure they take a few minutes to stand when they feel tired and if the legs get tired, they should rest them before doing anything else for a while. The other answer is that people don't do anything except sit down if they are tired.\nThere are many muscles and joints in your legs, feet, arms, hands, and eyes that require you to constantly stand up and walk around. When you are tired, this can take a significant toll on the legs, feet, arms and hands.\nThere are many muscle knots that the legs can experience in standing or sitting for long periods of time. These knots can be a sign that there is a problem with the muscles. For example, when someone stands, their legs and feet can get cramps. If the muscles in the legs start to spasm frequently it usually indicates a problem with the legs. When you are standing for long periods of time, it is not uncommon for joints to start to get painful sensations and you can get tight muscles in your head, neck, and shoulders.\nThere are many nerve issues in your legs. If you stand up many times a day, your nervous system has to coordinate your muscles and nervous system. When your nervous system is not coordinating with your muscles, it gets frustrated, can cause a lot of pain and stiffness, and can cause more problems than it solves.\nThere are many nerves in your feet. When you are standing, your feet send signals to the brain via the nervous systems and you are able to tell which part of your body is standing and which part is on the ground. However, when someone sits, their feet don't send messages to the brain and therefore their muscles do not have to coordinate these signals. When this happens, your muscles cannot move very effectively, and can even start to become painful.\nThere are many other parts of your body that can become too tired to function properly. The blood flow through your body is low, and as a result oxygen levels start to decline. This causes a lot of fatigue in the cells of your body.\nThere are many changes that can happen between standing and sitting. For example, when you are standing your head is in a higher position than when you are sitting down.", "answer": "A: sit down"}

{"text": "A. wall B. corner E. space shuttle F. tent\n\n Input: A customer walks into a hotel and is charged for a service not rendered. If the hotel provides that service at no extra charge after the client leaves, then the customer is legally entitled to 100% of his or her money. If the hotel charges the client a fee for this service after the client leaves, the client is legally entitled to 75% of that fee. How can we calculate this 75% fee so it stays at 75% (so that people will pay 50%?)\nInput: A customer pays $100 to the hotel. The hotel receives that $100 and charges the customer a one-time 50% service charge. The customer walks into the hotel two days later and claims he never asked for this service. If the customer complains, the hotel will call its credit card company to have the payment reversed. If the customer refuses to sign a consent, the hotel will sue the credit card company and may collect attorney\u2019s fees on behalf of the credit card company. You have the following choices:\n\nInput: A customer buys a 100-cent steak at the supermarket. While eating the steak, he smells something rotten. Before leaving the store, he says \u201cI\u2019ll go home, get my car, and have it towed.\u201d He does this. He makes a reservation with McDonald\u2019s for noon. He gets a delivery man to remove the steak from the garbage receptacle, and he pays for his McDonald\u2019s experience after the delivery man leaves. If the service was rendered at no extra charge to the customer, then he should be entitled to the fee for the McDonald\u2019s experience. Let\u2019s suppose the service were performed at no extra cost by the delivery man while at no extra cost to the customer. Suppose he also performed the work that we calculated as additional charges from his credit card. That work should not have been compensated for by the charge that we calculated. Assume this was an error in calculating or calculating the total service charge.\nOutput:\nIt seems as though there is some disagreement about the percentage of the total service charge owed to the customer. Please select which of the following answer would most accurately indicate the answer to the following question:\nA. The customer received 100% of the charge from the purchase of 100 cents worth of steaks.\nB. The customer received 50% of the charge (because the amount the customer paid was less than $10, and", "answer": "B: office"}

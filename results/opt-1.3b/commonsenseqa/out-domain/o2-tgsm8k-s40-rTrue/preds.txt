Choices:  A: make breakfast B: go hiking C: pack or bag D: light fire E: grab a match<n>Output:		 A: making breakfast requires 2 meals or more as breakfast is cooked and not eaten for several hours. B: packing or bagging food is just the start of making food as there is nothing less than half of what will be needed to eat while camping. C: hiking or camping without food means food can not be made on site either which is the only reason to use gas powered cooking as gas cannot be used on site. D: lighting a fire is just waiting for it to go out before eating the food. E: Grab a match is just a matter of timing it takes from taking the first bite which is usually when a meal will be ready before using the stove until it is time to eat after putting on sunscreen. F: light a fire is much more precise then using a grill however, the most significant time savings of lighting a fire is from removing the gas powered stove and keeping the entire camp stove fuel stored as there are precious few things to be able to store in the camp. G: Light a cook fire is just a matter of finding dry wood which is not always easy. H: Cooking on site requires having a source of heat that is not something you can eat which makes all food made to eat more difficult to make than it would be on site without cooking. I: Cooking on site requires more steps then can be done in other ways if you know what to do.<n>Output: After making all of the above meals, which is what one would want to do, then you would have the ingredients to make enough food for about one week.  So in order to get food to a camp fire for cooking, you would need to cook every three days.  And this would be done in a slow cooker which takes no time to keep fed.  By taking the above factors into account the most efficient way to cook is to cook over a campfire.<n><n>Input:The total number of times a driver can go 0 to 60 in 3 seconds is the maximum number of times a driver is allowed to drive in 20 seconds without having to stop and let traffic pass.

Choices:  A: strip club B: pocket C: millpond D: ontario E: lake or river<n>Output:		 C/D<n>Abe the beaver can destroy the working functions capabilities of a machine if he builds his dam in this order<n>A beaver can make the millpond a strip club by building his dam in this order. This requires that the millpond be placed in front of the strip club, which makes it impossible to use.<n>A beaver can take out the functionality of the factory machine if he builds his damn right next to the equipment at the factory. The dam blocks flow from the dam up to a point, which causes that point to be filled with water. Water is an energy negative.<n>On the same note, the pocket dam will completely destroy the working capabilities of the machine if the dam becomes large, which is why it's important for a dam not to get too big.<n>Millpond: A pocket dam is a dam in which each corner is surrounded by a second one. When water is removed from the corners and flows inside the dam, it fills up those holes. This decreases the area of the dam that can hold water. The more water that's in the dam, the less water is able to flow through the dam. Millpond is a dam that uses water at the bottom of the pool to fill up the holes.<n><n>Input:The three members of the team had to choose the most expensive cars to purchase.

Choices:  A: dog's mouth B: floor C: garage D: trouble E: nature<n>Output:		   Cat food  Cat food  Cat toys  Cat litter<n><n>Input:Cats like to go on walks.  The time a cat takes to go on an early morning walk is called the morning walk time.  To determine the distance a cat will walk during the day, it is helpful to divide the morning walk time by the age the cat is at.  This gives an estimate of how far a cat has walked at this time in years.  Age is determined by how many days of age it takes a cat to reach a certain age (this is a mathematical concept that is not easily written out).  The longer a cat is, the more likely it is that it has to walk more.  The age that a cat reaches depends on various factors such as the environment, the owner's lifestyle, and the age of the cat itself.   A cat's walk time is a ratio of time spent outdoors vs time indoors.  Many cats that have been outside their entire lives do not need as much time outdoors.  Cats that have been indoors their entire lives have to spend as much time inside as they out.<n>Cats that get along together are sometimes mistaken for siblings because they share the same house.  When cats go out together, they go through some of the same physical motions.  This sometimes comes as a shock to their owners.  To compensate for this, they will start using each other's litter boxes at an earlier age.  This habit eventually gets the best of the cat and it moves on, but it is hard to know if the cat is using a litter box in the house or outside in the garden.  Once in the house, it is possible that the cat will not use its litter box until it discovers that it has to use outside of its litter box.  When this happens, it will always prefer the house's litter box to use outside of its own litter box.  To determine the day on which the cat used a particular litter box, it is best to take the date and divide that by the age of the cat.<n>When a cat learns it has to take care of its own litter box, it will begin to pee in one place and leave the rest alone.  This is a symptom of the cat becoming a cat-owner.  After the cat is trained in the litter box as an owner's pet, it will be ready to get used to dealing with litter boxes.<n>It should be noted that cats can become more independent and even start hunting with their litter

Let's first try to figure out the probability that there were two Dobermans in the room.  (You may want to rewrite this part)  If there were 2 Doberams and two puppies in the room, what is the probability of one of the Doberams having a puppy?  Let's also look at how likely it is that there are two Doberams and not a puppy.  (This is also an assignment task.)<n>Let's say there were two Doberams and six puppies in the Room.<n>If all 6 puppies were intact, then the probability that one was a Doberam rather than a puppy is = 1.<n>If one of the dogs from the room could be out of the room, the probability that it would either be a Doberam rather... or a puppy would be 1.<n>Note: The probability that the two dogs would both have puppies is greater.  When we say there were 2, we mean that there was a 1 in 10 chance that one was a puppy.<n>We may think of the probability between puppies, intact, and out of the Room.  Thus a puppy means that the chances that a Doberam might have a puppy are greater.<n>There are 4 possibilities:<n>1) There was a 0.99 chance that there was a puppy.<n>2) There was a 1 in 10 (10 times fewer) chance of a puppy.<n>3) There was a 0 chance that there was a Doberam might also have a puppy.<n>4) There was a 0.99 chance that there was not a Doberam dog having a puppy.<n>So we have 4 possibilities and 2/3 of them are 1/10 or 1/50.<n><n>Input: They have a room full of

In the diagram: Which two areas are on the opposite sides of the Earth from each other?<n>Output: The area on the left is from the Sun to the Moon while the area on the right is from the Moon to the Earth<n><n>Output: This chart shows how many degrees the Earth rotates about its axis each day. Note that the Earth continues to rotate around the Sun. During the week when the Earth and Sun are in the same location in the sky (East-West), the Earth's axis rotates the same number of degrees each day. Notice that in the days when the Earth and Sun move towards each other from the same location in the Sky (North-South), the Earth's axis moves the same number of degrees per day.<n>In the days when the Earth is in the same location in both North-South and East-West, the Earth's axis rotations a number of degrees less each day.<n>To illustrate, consider how many degrees the Earth moves each day, and compare it to the total degrees the Earth rotates in a year.<n>The Earth moves 5.23983 miles (8.74399 km) in one degree.<n>The Earth rotates 5,76960 miles (9,9624 km) in 365° on the same year.<n>(This information is incorrect. The total number of miles traveled is 695.9540 km per year)<n><n>Output: You are to tell a story. Write an example in your journal. It is said that a scientist went to the North Pole. He noticed that the North Pole always moves in one direction and never changes direction. Then he thought about how long the Earth orbits the Sun. This is how far the Earth spends each day on her orbit around the Sun. So far she reaches her point in her orbit each day about 9.8 million years. The scientist then wondered why the Earth moves in one direction. The answer is: The Sun turns around the Earth as it orbits the Earth. The Sun moves back in one direction and the Earth moves back in the opposite direction. This is called a "polar motion." The Sun and the Earth are constantly passing each other during their orbits, and the Sun is constantly turning in one direction by itself, and the Earth is constantly turning in the opposite direction by itself. The Sun is constantly going around the Earth, and the Earth, in turn,

It's impossible for a child to have a 140 IQ.<n><n>Solution:<n><n>Input:<n>There were 30 dogs and 20 cats at the local shelter. The shelter had two cats and two dogs that were both a week old. The shelter placed all pets in the same foster home. A cat was spayed, the dog was not spayed and the shelter was giving the dog away so it could be adopted. When the cat went home, the dog had a new litter and was all excited about being inside and having another baby in the home. The shelter had not seen this happening. The shelter gave the dog to a very good home where the couple could take good care of the dog, so it did not end up like the other foster home.<n>The new dog's litter did not have any babies. It seemed to be the dogs that did not get a chance to have babies.<n>The new dog had kittens. The kittens were all about the the dog, and it was very sad to see them. The couple gave the new dog some food so it would not get lonely. The kitten didn't want to eat anything. The couple gave the kitten to a rescue group who was more willing. After seven days the cat was released back into the shelter to be fostered by the good couple who was willing.<n>The new cat had kittens again. The couple brought another cat in to the shelter, and the litter did not have any kittens. It seemed like the people that took the cats in had done a better job with the kittens to make sure the cats were very loved. The cats were so happy to see people, just like they had been when they were adopted

All along, you thought it was an effortless process. Now, you realize you have to take your baby everywhere you go.<n><n>Output:You may have taken your baby potty trained. There's still one area in the house that your baby is still a bit reluctant to go to.

The problem: if he isn't completely potty trained in a clean, safe area, he knows you have no intention of cleaning it up! Therefore, the problem is even worse. It's time to take your baby potty trained to the next level!<n><n>Input: Which is the fastest way to get a cat to use the litter box?

Choices:  A: winning B: entertainment C: happiness D: cheating E: relaxation<n>Output:		 Winning A: Entertainment.<n>Being able to win is just one thing in a game. The other side of game play is entertainment. Winning and other game play has a lot to do with enjoying the game play. Happiness comes in many forms. The best happiness comes from finding something that fulfills you and gives you joy. If the game play is not satisfying to the player then that will be the form of happiness that comes from the game. Cheating means playing the game in ways that the game could not possibly allow. This is a form of happiness that the player wishes to be happy and will cheat in whatever way they can. relaxation can be achieved in a variety of ways. Meditation, relaxation exercises, watching a great movie, spending time with the ones you love, the sun, exercising, finding music you like, meeting new people, talking to someone you enjoy talking to, spending time with your children, doing something you love, having fun, laughing, doing something silly...These are all forms of relaxing that people do on a regular basis.<n>Input:Which is the second most valuable item in this room?

But where does this zero exactly find or be found  of the complex numbers, the real numbers, or the variables? (For more information on the different places where zero may be found, see The study of mathematics and real numbers.)  This zero is not an infinite sequence, though it sometimes appears to be one.  It does, however, appear in most forms of probability and its applications, such as when it is found in the sum of points.  For example, the number of points in some probability distributions always depends on the number of repetitions in the original probability distribution; e.g. in normal distributions, the number of repetitions can be expressed as a sum of positive and negative points.  In all of these cases, zero can be used to represent  of the information.  In statistical computation, when a sample involves zero, it is always possible for  of the sample to be negative.  For example, in the case of  for  that sample can be described by a positive fraction of negative n points,  i.e.  n/2.  In statistical analysis, the ratio of a sample’s random errors to its means is always (typically) negative or positive. A particular type of error is known as a zero of estimation.  In probability theory, the probability that the set of  given the real numbers and  is independent is typically zero.<n>Zero of estimation has been studied by two mathematicians:  Max Tegmark of Stanford University and Max Born of the University of Chicago.  According to the paper Theoretical physics: the zero of estimation  from the real numbers of probability  is the set of the real numbers such that the minimum value of the real numbers is equal to each of the true numbers.

Choices:  A: city B: downtown C: own house D: bar E: shopping center<n>Output:		 There are two types of places to eat and a three levels of shopping centers<n>The first store, A is in downtown, and the second store, B is downtown. Since it takes two people to find both stores, a third person would have to go look for the third. If it was possible to find both stores in one car, they could each look by themselves.<n>The second store, B is in downtown, and it is not necessarily in downtown. It could also be within walking distance to downtown. Since the car has a limited amount of time, it has to make a quick choice whether to spend the time looking for downtown or go to store A.<n>Both A and B have three levels.<n>The car has to choose either store A or B.<n>A shop has a three levels.<n>The first store A, and the second store B. The third store, C has floors, and the first floor of D has the ground floor.<n>Now let's think about the third store, shopping center. It has three different levels; B, C, and D. The third store is the second highest level.<n>So in the first example, B is the second highest store.<n>In the second example, A is the first highest store.<n>In each example (A), when the car arrives at B, C, or D, if the three levels all have the one type of store that is best for the shopping area, the car can go to the store in B first. If its choice is B, then its car chooses to go to B. If its choice is C or D, then its car can choose one of the two. Since it does not have time to chose between stores A and B (the three levels have one type of store), it decides to go to store C. Since both stores A and B have the next highest store (D), the car can go to that store also.<n>In the shopping center example, the third level store is located at the end in the middle, and is the best to go to in search of food items.<n><n>Feedback<n><n>#1. "You'd have to be fairly short" - I do not want to be a long term solution, since it only lasts 6 months, unless there is a long term solution, or I would need to start a business and pay the rent and buy groceries or get married then, since I cannot start a business until I am 24 (and marry at 26) and I am not sure if

A person will always take the fax machine to the reception area so that it can be used (after all, everyone always needs a fax)  But the first thing that someone does with the fax machine is to get the number.  When they get the number, they find it is one letter short.  Then the person calls up the person who gave the number because they have missed something about the number.  The problem will not be solved because the person has given the wrong number; they will never get the item from the office  Because the person has already gotten themselves a fax; they will not stop to get the item they were hoping for.  This will lead to:<n>Output: "No fax, no problem" = "Problem solved".<n>Output: "If the office is not full, no fax" = "Not a problem".<n>Output

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n>Output:		 The beaver uses a lot of wood to build structures. The wood he is using is about as heavy as a human at about 25% the weight of a human.<n>Output: To build a beaver’s home, the beavers use most of their weight to build the home. As they do this, they create a hollow log that is shaped like the home. The wood of the home contains wood fibers and sand. Over time, the wood fibers harden because they have not been exposed to air. This results in the log retaining its shape. In the warm months, the beavers build homes in the winter and build them again at springtime when the snow melts.  Because the beavers used the same wood in the home throughout the build, it maintains its shape and size. In addition, the beavers build more homes in the spring due to the warm weather that is warmer than in the fall and winter. The home's location is where the logs that contain the wood can be assembled, such that the beavers will have the same location every season. This allows the beaver to build more homes, but also a smaller home than other animals. Since the beavers build several homes each season, the overall structure is less dense than what other animals use. The densities of other animals are higher due to building multiple homes.<n>As the beavers built more homes during April, so did their bodies. In particular, their bodies were heavier and bulkier. The increase in weight and bulkiness is attributed to the beavers using more wood.<n>Bridges are used by animals in two kinds of ways: (a) to cross rivers or streams, especially in colder environments; or (b) to cross over small streams, or narrow creeks, with no chance to build a bridge or to cross large streams, creeks, or rivers. In general, animals will build a bridge or crossing whenever there is a stream at a certain location. This means that the animals will be using a bridge or crossing whenever a stream is at a location a safe distance from the animals' habitat.  For example, dogs and cats will cross rivers and streams on a daily basis to get to their favorite water location. Some animals will use a bridge or a crossing on a weekly basis. Other animals may not use a bridge or crossing.<n>A beaver builds dams to control floods. These dams can be made out of wood or concrete. When an abnormally large amount of water passes over a beaver dam,

To form a QWERTY keyboard, you place down on the keyboard's left row a key called "Z", and when you press this key, it sends the letters "Z" and "Q" to the right side of the keyboard while also sending a letter of the alphabet to the left side. Some QWERTY keyboard makers place a "Z" lower down, while others place it lower and higher. The QWERTY keyboard was not invented until 1936.  For a QWERTY keyboard consisting of all letters Z' to Z', the following keys are needed:  ZQWERTY. This key is used a lot in the QWERTY keyboard and is commonly known as QWERTY-Z.  Another key commonly used is QWERTY-R, which is the letter K.<n>The QWERTY language has four letters for the letters Z', Q', R' and K', where the "R" key is not used. It has no letters of its own. It uses the letters "Z" "Q" and "R" in the same order, with space between each of them.<n>This QWERTY keyboard can also be combined to form QWERTY-C. This combination combines the QWERTY keyboard with the letters C, D and E. The QWERTY-C keyboard only uses the letters R, Q, R' and K' along with space between them. It can also be confused with QWERTY-Z because Z and Q are used frequently together.<n>There is also a version of QWERTY-C that uses the letter W, which is also commonly confused with QWERTY but instead of a "space" between R and Q, it has two spaces in the keyboard row.<n><n>Input:What is the name of the letter Q? The answer given is Q. What is the name of the R key? The answer given is R. What is the name for the Z key? The answer given was Z. What is the name ZR? The answer given is Z. What is the symbol R for? The answer given is F. What is the symbol ZR for?

It didn't like the smell of the roses. It also didn't like the smell in the hen-house. It was quite annoyed at the hen-house. Finally it decided to go outside, to the forest.  The fox kept its eyes on the hen-house for 5 minutes more but couldn't find it. After 5 minutes it decided to keep trying. Finally, after another 5 minutes, it found the chicken and took him away. The fox kept hoping that the hen-house would appear again but it did not. After 5 more minutes, it decided to come back again later. It walked slowly in a straight line for 15 minutes.   The fox arrived to the thickest part of the forest. The fox kept saying - and stopped - I got tired and decided to walk to the end.   The fox walked for 20 more minutes. After another 20 minutes, the fox decided to give up and came back home. It returned to the place it had first saw the chicken. There, a bird was sitting next to a flower, it's neck flapping as it was trying to fly. The fox was surprised. If that bird is so strong, how would it be able to fly with its flapping neck? The fox tried to catch the bird by it's neck.  Finally, after a long struggle and pulling the bird by its neck, it caught the chicken and tried again, this time catching the bird.   The fox felt that the chicken was really strong. It tried to lift the chicken by his neck again and again, but the chicken kept escaping. Finally, after about 15 minutes of this struggle, with great effort, the fox managed to lift the chicken up by his neck and carry the chicken home to its lair.<n>Input:Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrush heads to give away to his employees.

Choices:  A: backyard B: restaurant C: crockpot D: neighbor's house E: barbeque<n>Output:		 Sous vide cooking.<n>The cooking is a slow process in which a liquid is maintained in a temperature range not higher than a certain temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.<n>You can cook a food by a slow cooker or broiler without food being burned by the heat.<n>A slow cooker uses a heating element that is placed on a rack inside a box or in a pot (the cooker itself is not contained in a box of any kind, shape, or size). The element is placed at the bottom or top of the kitchen and is connected to the heat source by a hose or cord.<n>If the source of heat is a gas or electric stove, a heat pipe is used, which connects the heating element and the food to it. The cooking can be done in the kitchen, or on the stove, without any food (or some food) being harmed by the intense heat of the stove.<n>A crockpot has a pot that is fitted with a glass rim (the pot does not hold any liquid) and a handle or a handlelet placed at the bottom of the pot (the pot does not have a lid). A crockpot also has a lid that is mounted on the bottom of the pot for closing and lidded off when not in use.<n>A slow cooker is a separate pot (or pot) that is placed inside a box or a pot. A slow cooker is the same as a crockpot: it works the same as a crocker, but the difference is that you don't add any liquid or food to the slow cooker while it is still warm. The slow cooker heats the liquid at the same temperature from the top of the box to the bottom of the box. A slow cooker will allow for more even cooking without letting excess heat go to the bottom of the stove.<n>You can use a slow cooker to cook meat, poultry, vegetables, or fruit. You can also cook eggs, cheese, or meatloaf in one.<n>The slow cooker is a popular choice for a large party as it is easy to cook (it can cook up to six to ten meals). It is a more expensive option for parties of one or two people than for two or three people.<n>An electric broiler is a device to roast an egg.<n>The slow cooker can also be used to slow roast foods (chicken, turkey, beef) in the oven. The slow cooker can also be a great heating source for baked goods, rice, sautéed vegetables, and many other foods

How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Output: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>So the final answer is 36<n><n>Input:What is required to be good at playing tennis? Choices:  A: tennis racket B: skill C: competition D: tennis court E: legs<n>Output:		 A: tennis racket B = Tennis. C = Tennis court D = Tennis court E = Legs<n>One could say that tennis skills are required in order to be good at tennis. One could also say that tennis equipment is required to be used in order to take part in tennis. Is that true? Or is tennis equipment not required in order to play tennis?<n>Input: Tennis courts and tennis rackets can be said to be necessary because they are necessary for playing tennis.  But tennis rackets can be seen as not necessary, in that they can be put into a bag and the tennis courts can be built from a number of common materials like concrete and bricks.<n>Output: A = Tennis court B = Tennis. C * Tennis equipment D = Tennis court E * Tennis = Tennis Equipment Legs<n>Thus the answer to the above question is tennis racket B = Tennis court.<n>The last option (B) is probably correct<n><n>Input: What is the reason why some girls (or boys, for that matter) prefer certain hairstyles and some do not?<n>Output: Some girls (or boys, that matter) choose hairstyles that are popular, such as:  hairstyle A: big hair B: short hair C: natural hair D: curls E: all or nothing F: up or down?<n>So the answer to the question is to find out why some girls (or young boys) prefer hairstyle A (short hair) and some girls (or young children) will not prefer hairstyle A (a hairstyle that is not usually popular in their culture) (for example, hair is not allowed to fall out). If a haircut is popular enough, then everybody chooses it, and there is no preference, so the answer again would be hairstyle A.<n>Output: For hairstyle A, I would say it is because it is the latest trend. For hairstyle B, I would think it is so popular that there must be a good reason for it, whether that reason is a good reason or not I wouldn't say.<n>So the answer would be some kind of current trends.<n><n>Input: How many ways can be there to say that there are 6.5+8+12+20+30+40+50+60+80+100+110+130?<n>Output: It is possible to say that there are 26 other ways to divide 60 into 2 decimal places.<n>For example, 3/2/5/10 of 60 is divisible by 6.

Choices:  A: carpenter's shop B: video game C: garage D: total number E: building<n>Output:		The number of levels in a city has more than one level.<n>What is a garage?<n>A garage is anything built in a garage.<n>A total number of building/storage levels.<n>A total number built in a year.<n>A total number stored and owned in a lifetime.<n><n>Input:What would happen if you took a large quantity of Doberman puppy and took them all out of a puppy mill and put them all together?<n>Output:No one has done this experiment yet.<n>It's very unlikely that Doberman puppies would be kept all together. Puppy mills typically keep their Doberman puppies in small cages that are separated by several inches.<n>The Doberman puppy in the city who has the largest range in temperature is expected to be in the northern part of the city and may not be in a city full of Doberman puppies in the southern part of the city. In the city where there are many Doberman puppies, the range in temperature would likely be small. That puppy would be the only one in the city who would have the largest range in temperature. So he would be most likely to have an extreme range in temperature and would be more likely to break the average temperature range. The average temperature for the city contains some Doberman puppies whose temperature ranges are much closer to each other than the extreme range.<n>Output:Doberman puppies are not kept all together in puppy mills. When they come from puppy mills they are kept in cages from which the population is usually larger than a city and kept in a home where temperatures are warmer than what would be allowed at puppy mills.<n><n>Input: If you saw a picture of a person with a shaved head who lived in a city, which part of the human face did you guess it was from?<n>Output:A. the face closest to the camera<n>B: the face farthest away from the camera<n>C: somewhere else<n>D: somewhere else<n><n>Input:What part of a dog's body would most easily be removed?

The doctor says, "You're going to need to clean that out." "How? I'll never get it out, I can't reach it!" the dog pleads. The doctor explains, "Take a big spoonful just deep enough to reach the opening." The dog does, and gets the dog inside. Then, the Vet says, "Take another big spoonful just deeper. Then another. When you get up close, you'll be able to reach it and clean it out." The dog does, reaching around the opening to get to the opening. Then, the Vet puts the dog in a cone. He gives the dog a spoonful of food to eat and says, "Now put it back in the dish." The dog does, returning to the dish for another spoonful. The Vet does this for at least 30 seconds with one spoonful, trying to reach for the opening. On the next spoonful, the Vet uses a second spoon to eat it. On the next spoon, even with a second, the vet still can't get the dog's poop out. The next time the vet goes in, he sticks a plastic spoon through the opening to reach the bottom of the dish. Then, the vet takes the end of the plastic spoon and pushes it through the opening, bringing the dog's poop out of the bottom. The vet pulls the end of the spoon out before the dog can reach. So, the dog does this 30 times. What do the vet's observations of this do to this dog? Would the vet have noticed that this dog was dyslexic? So, the dog does 30 times and the vet would have noticed. But, the dog did it on purpose, in his sleep, without waking up. That's a dyslexic trait, and the vet could have told that. So, the final answer is Yes.<n><n>Input:     At lunch one day, a professor asks his secretary for ice cream. "Awwwwwwwwwww yeahhh!"  The secretary then asked, "Why was Mr. Black here today?"

He calculated that the total for his team was 6,480.<n>During the first two days, 40 nurses missed work because they arrived late for their shift. Then, during the third and fourth day, 60 of the 300 nurses were there at work, and only 10 missed work.

He went to his local adoption center and asked "How much would you take my dog? The puppy was very clean". The adoption center replied "I can pick you up a new one for $25." He replied "That's a steal, what's your name?"<n>The adoption center said "Name's 'Bud'." He said "That's a great name, but what is it?" The adoption center said "Don't worry about it; that puppy is free."<n>The man said "You're wrong; it isn't free; the puppy is still available for $25." He went home and told his wife. Her face lit up. "I have a new puppy". She said "Bud's a really cute puppy, you should have taken him!". The man was devastated. Finally, the woman threw a chair across the room at him. "Do you know what dog you have? This dog isn't even yours. He doesn't deserve a place in the family."<n>The man said, "I want to stay with the family that gave me a free puppy". "No, you don't. You need to go look for your own home!"<n><n>Output:  The man and his wife left the shelter. After they got home they set out on a mission in an attempt to find a new home for Bud. They drove 30 miles each direction of their town to find a new home. 30 miles is a long way for a dog to travel to find a home. The man drove a car for 3 hours to find a new family for Bud. "No wonder he was so upset" she thought. "I had no idea he would hate me!"<n>When they got home, the man decided to take Bud to a groomer to get his hair trimmed to make him look good for the new family. The groomer was worried when he saw the dog with his long hair. He said, "Oh, it's okay, it was only a haircut". He didn't know that Bud was a Doberman.<n>The man said "Oh Bud, I'm so sorry this guy is mean to you! Can you believe he would say that to a healthy dog? I know this man is just trying to look out for me, but I want your family to know I'm fine", referring to the groomer. The groomer couldn't believe it when he saw the dog

There are 2x20 columns, 3x10 rows, and 5x2 columns in the grid. In the grid we would divide the 5x2 columns into 3x2 columns and the 3x10 columns into 5x2 columns.  In the grid there are 10 black squares in the center and 5 white squares in each of the other columns.  In each of the 10 black squares, we have 0x10x10 black squares, 0x10x10 white squares, and 1x10 black squares.  In the 5x2 columns there are 5 black squares in the center, and 5 white squares in those rows.  In the 10x100 grid there are 10 black ones in the center and 10 white ones in those columns.  This gives us 8x10^100.  If the black square in column 5 and column 8 were the same color we would have an odd number of squares in the columns.  In particular, 2x10 = 2 * 5 = 10.  We would want to find every square in the 10x100 grid. There are 2x10^100 times 10x100 = 256 different squares.  How many combinations of squares can we find? You have one square.<n>Input: 10x100 is the same as 2x10^100.<n>Output: 2x10^100 is 256 times 10x100 = 10*2x10^100 = 10.<n>If one square is black the other square is white. We now have 10x10^100 in which case 4x10^100 = 0. We could have 2 black squares in the middle of the 10x100 grid but that would be even.  A better choice would be 2 black squares in the center of each other square.  8x10^100 still gives us 2x10^100 in the 10x100 cell

Her mother is very worried about her sister. When the girl is being dishonest or irresponsible toward her sister, her mother tells her that she won’t be able to be trusted; but when the girl is being dishonest to her mother, she tells her that she will not change her ways.<n>Output:The girl is excellent at hiding her feelings from the boy that her mother likes. Because she doesn’t want to change the way she is with her mother, she is very bad at hiding her feelings. After being told that she can’t change the way she is acting, the girl is very upset; but when her mother tells her that it won’t matter what she does, she just doesn’t understand. The girl lies to her mother repeatedly, and does whatever she feels like. So the final answer is no

Choices:  A: botanic garden B: flower garden C: backyard D: supermarket E: outdoors<n>Output:		 I can count, but not count the roses. Which of the following do you think is the correct answer?<n>Input: There are 2 types of roses which are unusual. One is called a dwarf rose and another is a sweet rose. The dwarf rose has a small trunk and a big showy flower. The sweet rose has small but very nice flowers and a larger trunk. Which is the most unusual one?<n>Output: According to your guess, there were only 2 types of roses. One is called a Dwarf rose and the other is a Sweet rose.<n>The first way to find out whether a rose is unusual or not is to get the number of roses that are unusual. So the number of roses that would be odd is 1 minus the number of plants that are unusual. So we can find out if a flower is unusual based on the number of weird plants on it. So the roses that are unusual are those that are unusual to only some of the plants in the garden. So the roses that would be odd in a flower shop are any roses that you get at the local garden shop. In order to find out if there are unusual roses in your garden, ask neighbors and friends to guess the number of unusual rose plants you have and the number of unusual bushes and trees. Ask them to guess the number of roses that you have and the number the unusual bushes and trees, also. Now ask them to guess the number there are unusual roses that are on your garden as well, but with or without the bushes or trees.<n>Input: There was a famous story that happened when the Japanese built in Mount Fuji.

In fact, images of tropical plants in gardens work quite well. You can imagine the effects on the plants when the day is hot and humid.

Every organ, every area of the brain, and every part of each organ should be free of pathology for the doctor to perform an operation.<n>But that is not the world we live in. A disease cannot exist somewhere that is not physically present. If your heart is infected, there could be a bacterial infection (Bacteremia) that causes a stroke (or hemorrhagic stroke) if you stop eating or drinking fluids for an extended period of time, while you are in the process of a major operation where blood will need to be taken and transfused in order to save your life. Or if you are an organ that is damaged such that organ would not be able to perform all of its functions properly after an operation.<n>When you perform an operation, such as performing blood work and other things to diagnose any sort of an illness, if that particular organ is damaged, or if that particular organ's function is compromised, then you cannot perform the operation. All organs and all health systems and all medical professionals involved in the operation will be unable to perform that particular type of operation. Organs will not be able to function like normal organs and health systems will not be able to operate like normal health systems. And then, of course, there is the question, does your life and your health function well under that particular type of arrangement?<n>How many organs would be necessary in a perfect world to perform every type of operation ever? Every operation ever, in every patient situation? To be able to perform every type of operational function ever? A perfect world

There are 4 apples that take 3 seconds to count. There’s 1 apple that takes 2 seconds to count. There is no apple that takes 3 seconds to count. How many apples are left in Sam’s family? There are 6 apples left in Sam’S family. Each person in his family is eating two apples. Sam's son is eating three apples because he had them with dinner.<n>The difference would have been 2 apples if Sam had passed out one apples and his son had passed out 2 apples.<n>In order to find the number of apples left in Sam's son's family, Sam would have had to count every apple passed out by his son on the table. The time would have taken Sam 5 minutes to count all 6 apples in his son's family. Sam wouldn’t want to count his own apples (especially when he is hungry and wants to eat), so he told his son to pass the remaining apples to his brother. How close did Sam come to counting out the exact number of apples in his son's son's family?  If his son had passed out 6 apples, Sam would have counted out 6 apples left in his son's family instead of the 8 that he found.<n>A quick hint; Sam passed out 1 apple, counted it 3 times and then gave it to his daughter.<n>Which one would result in this exact number of apples left in his family?<n>What happens next? Sam asked his mom to count out all the remaining apples. The amount of apples left in her family would have been 2 apples less, 6 apples.<n>There were only 6 apples<n>So the second apple Sam counted would have been 2 apples. Sam would have found his sister and given her 1 apple to count. He would have counted out

Choices:  A: happen to people B: hurt people C: happen anytime D: happen often E: happen anywhere<n>Output:		 The lady stated that the increase in accidents in their area didn’t really affect her enough to care. The husband was dismissive but not too long thereafter, his wife was hit by a bus. So then how does the increase in accidents affect people?<n>The answer is A. In the case of A, the answer isn’t as cut and dry because the accident injured people regardless of their socioeconomic status. This includes both the poor and the wealthy people. So in the case of A, we can safely say that more accident happened in poor and wealthy areas.<n>On the other hand, there’s no way to know for sure that accidents happen to people because they have the means to sustain their auto accidents, while poor and wealthy people can just move away when they get sick and die. So from that viewpoint, they wouldn’t be affected either way.<n>Let’s say accidents happen to people because: (1) They are careless and don’t care about their motor cars B: Because people in poor and rich areas don’t care to buy car as compared to people in middle class and poor areas. C: Because they have the means to move out of their country and die when they got sick D: Because people in middle class and wealthy communities are used to be hit by bus, which also gives them enough time to escape and stay at a new place.<n>Now let’s take a look at the answer for B: (1) This is an example where it would be fair to say that accidents don’t happen to people due to their car. It depends on how many accidents did happen in your area before and after the article. (2) This is an example in which people in middle class, rich areas wouldn’t get hurt as much because of the fact they aren’t a part of lower class poor population. (3) However, this would only apply for the poor population and not the upper class poor population. (4) This would only apply for people who are poor and not rich. (5) This is an example from the standpoint of average poor population would be affected the least, because they would only buy car only when they have to take something important with them. (6) This is an example for the rich population, if you are poor, you may be more likely to die by bus, because you are more likely to be more careless when it comes to your car. (7) This is a question with

You'll need 24 doses to get your<n>desired dosage of 250 milligrams each time.<n>You see, you have to take an average of 30 doses of penem in order to get the dosage of 250 milligram.<n><n>You don't have to take 25 doses of penem to get 250 micrograms of penem.<n>You have to take 70 doses of 50 micrograms penem to get a dosage of 250 micrograms.<n><n>But how can you get 70 doses of 50 micro gram penem? Well if we take a 10 dose pill of penem, we only need 10 doses to get the same dosage of 250 milligrous pills of penem that we would get with a 50 dose pill. So we only need a 10 dose pill.<n><n>We've seen a 10 dose penem pill for only 1 milligram. It isn't even 50 micrograms. It isn't as if you would get a 50 micrograms pill. I don't know when I've seen a penem 100 micrograms. No, your 20 dose 50 milligrams

Choices:  A: hatred B: surprised C: compliments D: dedication E: solutions<n>Output:		 If someone has a hatred for something, it is their duty to keep hate in check.  If someone has a surprise for something, than they must take it with a grain of salt.  If someone has their fingers in everything and their mouth is always full, then they should be careful about every mouthful that they take in.  If someone is dedicated to something and puts in all of his or her effort, it is his duty to take all of those things with a grain of salt as well.  If someone is always giving and taking care of others, it is his duty not to throw the kindness in a corner because he may have to take it a little late.  If someone is a strong leader and can always get everyone on board for a greater cause, and they are always willing to do whatever it takes to put it in place, then they should be praised and given a medal for all of their hard work.  If I were to give the best solutions, choices and inspiration, then I would have to be a bit of a dictator because I would want to make sure my solution was the best decision for the team.  If I were too hard on myself, then I would never be able to be the best leader for this team since it would hurt the team, the business and me!  Also, it would make me a pretty bad role model for my children as I do not deserve their love!  Just like with anything else, if I do not do it right the first time then I will do it wrong the next time and that is just something that I do not want to go along with.

To reduce a person's consumption of poultry and fish, a corresponding decrease would be less than that 70%. To increase one's consumption of chicken, turkey and lamb by more than 70%, the corresponding increase would be less than that of a decrease of 40% or more. For example, if a person eats 30 chicken eggs and a pound of chicken meat a week, the person would need to eat at least 30 chickens and 35 pounds of chicken meat a week to reduce by that much their consumption of chicken and turkey. For example, if the person eats 30 chicken eggs to replace a pound of chicken meat to reduce his/her consumption of those foods, the corresponding decrease in poultry and/or fish consumption would be less than a pound. For example, assuming 30/lb of each of chicken, turkey and pig meat, the corresponding decrease in the person's poultry/fish consumption would be less than that amount since 30 chickens would not equal 45 lbs of

Number of people per row in the room at the same time a fight breaks out. If number per row does not come into play, the people in the row nearest the fight will go to the front of the row to get out from under it. Is all this fair?<n>Output:<n>Number per row was 2. Number per row in the room was 13. Number per row per row in the room total was 32, meaning that the number of people in all the rows in the room was 32.<n>The people fighting were 13 people. The row in front of the fight could have a 5 rower team. Therefore, the total was 10 since some people were in that row and some people were in the row behind that row. The number of people in the row next to the row, and also the number in the row behind, was 2 people. The row in between those two rows was empty. The people standing behind the row closest to the fight were 13 people. So the total for the entire row was 32.<n>Number of people per row should be limited unless you want everyone in the area, to be looking across the room to the fight. If no one in the row next to or further away than the fight notices the fight coming when it begins, and there is not much room to look around, then the rules should be allowed to apply.<n>Of course, many people would still probably be offended and offended people should be warned for being offended, and this should be considered before letting this happen.<n><n>Input: You have a friend for whom you have a great fondness.

How would you solve this problem?<n>Output:<n>It is a problem if you only ever go if you have time for both of these things.<n>In order for you to know when you can go without spending all your time with her, you will need to look at your friend's birthday, and then add an extra day based on when the party is. This can either be before or after her birthday. If it is after her birthday, then at most you only need to go once to celebrate her

Why do you think a civil action can be a precursor to litigation?  A:  Because  most civil actions are initiated in response to some kind of wrongdoing on the part of someone else.   B:  Because  an action may lead to a result or decision.  It is generally in the public interest for a civil action to continue.  C:  Because an action will be costly and time consuming.  A civil action is likely to be  dismissed if a plaintiff does not provide evidence supporting their claim for damages.  D:  Because a civil action can serve as  a launching pad for litigation.  If a plaintiff doesn’t bring a civil action, he  may be a potential defendant in a future civil action.  A civil action may lead to a favorable ruling after  the original case has been filed, and the plaintiff may eventually have a chance of winning the case if the underlying cause in the original suit is still alive.  A civil action generally is a precursor to litigation.

Choices:  A: supermarket B: motel C: at hotel D: shampoo bottle E: hair salon<n>Output:		 In the supermarket, shampoo cost $2.50. So it took them a whole crate to deliver one shampoo. So at motel, shampoo cost $10. So shampoo bottle = $6.50.  At shampoo bottle, shampoo cost $42. A total of $90 of shampoo was taken.<n>In the supermarket, shampoo cost 42, but shampoo bottle cost $10, so shampoo bottle only cost $42. But shampoo bottle still cost $42 since it cost $42 and shampoo bottle cost $10.<n>So shampoo bottle cost 42 instead of $10 at motel. The total amount of shampoo left is now 6. So shampoo bottle cost 62 instead of $42.<n>So shampoo bottle = $62.<n>So shampoo bottle is now 6. Shampoo bottle cost 62 instead of 42 at motel. 6 x $42 = $10<n>So shampoo bottle is $10 instead of 62 at motel<n>So shampoo bottle cost $42 instead of $10 at supermarket<n>So shampoo bottle is 6 instead of 62 at motel.<n>So shampoo bottle was 6 instead of 62 at supermarket<n>This evaluates to 6 (2*42)/2 (2*42)<n>So shampoo bottle = ($42/6) = = ($60/6) = $2<n>Shampoo bottle = 62 not $42

To answer a question: "What is three plus one and three minus three?", you need to know the answer by dividing your total number of words with how many digits are included, and then multiplying them by five.  For example, if the number of words equals 6, divide the total by 5; and if they are 3, divide by 11; and if they are 5, divide by 25. Therefore, 3 plus 1, 2 minus 3 and 1 minus five are: "1.3.9.25 = 1.4.16, and 3.5.17 = 5.4."  Now to answer a question about the number five, you go to an article on Wikipedia, divide it by 5, get the number five and multiply it by 11.  Therefore, 5.5 = 5.0, and 6.1 = 6.1.<n>Input:How many dogs are there? Answer 2<n>Output:Five<n>Number one dog = 2, number two dog = 3.

Choices:  B. cause spots C. wellness D. ball E. cure<n>Output #1: Cause Spotting  = (1) 2 + 4 = 9 = 26.  It took 4 days for the spot to form.  Since the disease was spreading fast, it took 4 days to form the spot.  The researchers found they didn’t need to wait until a symptom occurred. They could get a diagnosis early, and find a treatment.<n>Output #2: Wellness   = 26 + 4 + 10 = 42.   They noticed on the first day the disease was spreading they already caught the disease.

So they decided they needed to do something about the disease!  They started to investigate the disease and found they didn’ty have any effective way to curb it.<n>Output #4: Cure   = 64 + 8+14 = 112.  They searched for any methods of stopping the disease.  They discovered that a disease as it turned out to be was named “Ball Fever.”  They found that some of the disease was caused by an increased “Ball” blood pressure.  They found this by comparing the rates of Ball Fever cases with disease cases in the same community and finding that there was only a 1.7 percent overlap.  The disease rate in the community was too high to be caused by the disease itself.  So they started to recommend doctors prescribe medication and diet changes to people with mild Ball Fever and make sure they kept their Ball in good shape so they didn’t get too sick.<n>Source: http://www.physicsblog.com/news/spreading-disease-a-discussion-on-ball-fever/<n><n>Input:  The cost of raising a $100,000 goat is $3,000, but the cost of raising a $25,000 goat is $6,000.<n>Output:  The cost of raise a $100,000 GOAT is $3,000.

Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n>Output:		 To institute a civil action one must have a feeling such as: (1) a need for vindication, (2) a need to show he's done nothing wrong in response to the claims of an enemy or foe, or that there's been a mistake in judgment, (3) the need for fairness in a court of law.  As such one would not settle out of court with this complaint unless (1) it is true or (2) the damages in the case can be adequately explained or (3) his suit will bring change.<n>Input: To institute a civil claim one must have a feeling of injustice. The most extreme example:  A: The owner of a building was renting the building to an individual. A tenant lived in that building and paid rent, the owner refused rent because he didn't believe the tenant paid rent, and the court gave him that rent back, that he didn't pay him.  Output: If you want to bring change to a system, you have to have some type of feeling of injustice.  To institute this type of civil action, you must have some justice, such as being a criminal/war criminal. This type of civil action would be initiated by someone who feels they've been wronged by society as a whole.  In this case a civil action wouldn't be initiated if it is based on race or wealth.   One has to feel that (1) he's been wronged by somebody else other than himself (2) being a victim, a criminal (3) being wronged by an enemy or foe and (4) bringing some type of change to the system.<n>Input: To create a civil case in the United States, one must have a feeling that he feels wronged by the court system. In other countries, if you go to a court, you could have that feeling from the very moment you enter the room, because most countries practice a two-day trial system in which a case that goes to trial is determined to be either good or bad, and it would be given at least two years to work on a case to determine the outcome.  If your judgment isn't good enough and your case isn't good enough to work with such a time frame, then you cannot initiate a civil action. So an initiate a civil action in the U.S.A. does not necessitate having a feeling of injustice because in the U.S., one has to have a judgment that can not work with a two-day period or a time

Answer: When the leaves start changing from red to black and white. Let’s say it takes eleven days to change from red to white.

I am a very careful server, but there are still some people who seem to think that a table in the middle of a busy restaurant would pay for themselves if you paid them $1.<n><n>Input:A business decides to charge less than $1.00 per cup of coffee, but raises the per cup minimum to $2.50.<n>Output:They lose money. The customers complain.<n>The minimum costs of coffee are only $1 per cup, and the maximum costs are the cost of the product itself (and a coffee drink is not a product). Therefore the restaurant should increase it total cost by $2.50 and charge the customers for the coffee. As a consumer, I would either think the minimum is too high and refuse to drink the coffee. If I drink the coffee, I will be willing to pay more for future coffee purchases than I did when the minimum cost was $1.<n>The customer complaint has no effect on the business, so it can raise the minimum to even higher levels if it wants to (and is willing to) continue having the minimum service charge.<n>Since the customer complaint had no effect on the business (no increase in customer spending), it can raise the charge (and the minimum) whenever the business wants.<n><n>Input:You have three

They are going away for a week, away for a visit, to a friend's boat. The youngest adult stays overnight.  One teenager has diarrhea and is vomiting. She has a fever of 1012.  The teenager is fine after the morning medicine. They are not going on any kind of vacation.  One night later her roommate becomes very sick.  She also has a fever of 1014.  They have been together for 3 days with no problems and are going on a cruise.  After the fever, the roommate has diarrhea and vomiting.  She has a fever of 1002.  The roommate takes the morning medicine. By the second night she has a fever of 1003.  She gets into bed around midnight and goes to sleep about 3.  She is fine in the morning.<n>The next morning the fever continues.  The roommate has diarrhea for 3 days.  By the fourth day, she has a fever of 1020.  This is a serious and a very dangerous bug.  The fever has returned.  The roommate is taken to the hospital.  When she leaves the hospital, she is the one who becomes ill.  She has a 104 fever.  She is still staying with the teenager. Because of the fever for 3 days after the trip, it was impossible to get anything from the teenage mother's boyfriend.  And because of the night she had before she was taken to the hospital, not taking the morning medicine and taking the medication late in the night meant the teenager didn't have long with her child before she went to the hospital.  Without antibiotics, the infection may progress to a serious fever.   She was taken on a high dose of antibiotics to be sure she had the infection. She came back the next day with a fever of 1020 and a 103 fever.  The family returned home on August 21, 1999.  Two days of antibiotics were not enough. She was back at the hospital, taking two more antibiotics. The fever had not gone down when she left the hospital.  So the family went back on antibiotics.  The fever was still there. On Monday, August 26th, the roommate and the teenage daughter went away for a week.  They

Because he was feeling pleasure instead of delight.<n>Because I spent all my money on penis enlargement products, I was feeling what? *I'm not sure, but I'm gonna guess 'pleasure'*<n>Because I spent all of my life savings buying penis enlargement products, a little bit of pain for a temporary pleasure, is just how it would have felt.

Choices:  A: sit down B: make mistakes C: have sex D: reproduce E: excrete<n>Output:		 Humans stand when they are tired. The best results are if the legs have been standing for a while and the person is used to being in a standing position. If the legs are getting tired but the person does not have a lot of experience standing in a standing position for a long period of time, they should make sure they take a few minutes to stand when they feel tired and if the legs get tired, they should rest them before doing anything else for a while. The other answer is that people don't do anything except sit down if they are tired.<n>There are many muscles and joints in your legs, feet, arms, hands, and eyes that require you to constantly stand up and walk around. When you are tired, this can take a significant toll on the legs, feet, arms and hands.<n>There are many muscle knots that the legs can experience in standing or sitting for long periods of time. These knots can be a sign that there is a problem with the muscles. For example, when someone stands, their legs and feet can get cramps. If the muscles in the legs start to spasm frequently it usually indicates a problem with the legs. When you are standing for long periods of time, it is not uncommon for joints to start to get painful sensations and you can get tight muscles in your head, neck, and shoulders.<n>There are many nerve issues in your legs. If you stand up many times a day, your nervous system has to coordinate your muscles and nervous system. When your nervous system is not coordinating with your muscles, it gets frustrated, can cause a lot of pain and stiffness, and can cause more problems than it solves.<n>There are many nerves in your feet. When you are standing, your feet send signals to the brain via the nervous systems and you are able to tell which part of your body is standing and which part is on the ground. However, when someone sits, their feet don't send messages to the brain and therefore their muscles do not have to coordinate these signals. When this happens, your muscles cannot move very effectively, and can even start to become painful.<n>There are many other parts of your body that can become too tired to function properly. The blood flow through your body is low, and as a result oxygen levels start to decline. This causes a lot of fatigue in the cells of your body.<n>There are many changes that can happen between standing and sitting. For example, when you are standing your head is in a higher position than when you are sitting down.

You have the following choices:<n><n>Input: A customer buys a 100-cent steak at the supermarket. While eating the steak, he smells something rotten. Before leaving the store, he says “I’ll go home, get my car, and have it towed.” He does this. He makes a reservation with McDonald’s for noon. He gets a delivery man to remove the steak from the garbage receptacle, and he pays for his McDonald’s experience after the delivery man leaves. If the service was rendered at no extra charge to the customer, then he should be entitled to the fee for the McDonald’s experience. Let’s suppose the service were performed at no extra cost by the delivery man while at no extra cost to the customer. Suppose he also performed the work that we calculated as additional charges from his credit card. That work should not have been compensated for by the charge that we calculated. Assume this was an error in calculating or calculating the total service charge.<n>Output:<n>It seems as though there is some disagreement about the percentage of the total service charge owed to the customer. Please select which of the following answer would most accurately indicate the answer to the following question:<n>A. The customer received 100% of the charge from the purchase of 100 cents worth of steaks.<n>B. The customer received 50% of the charge (because the amount the customer paid was less than $10, and

Choices:  A: university B: concert C: home D: terminal E: airport<n>Output:		 University, Concert, Airport<n>The security at some colleges is so heavily criticized.  Some would say the entire security is so heavily criticized, it may as well not exist.<n>If something happened at a concert, and a terrorist walked in from the balcony, would he even be detected?<n>If something happened at an airport, and a terrorist were to break into the terminal, would he even be discovered?<n>The main problem is not the security system, it is the way in which security is portrayed. Most people have not ever been victimized by a terrorist who successfully bypassed security. The only time it happens is when two terrorist go at it, or when a few terrorists who have been watching each other for the past 8 hours decide to go at it. If the terrorists are so highly scrutinized, why are they not able to get through the security? Some of them are caught and some are not. If the problems with security can be fixed, why don't they?<n>If one went to the airport, and walked in, that would be fine and normal.  He would be able to go in, leave, and be on his way.

If you play too much, it is more likely that you are going to get hurt again.<n>On the other hand, when you feel really bad, you are less likely to get hurt playing and are most likely to be out of a game.<n>Since you are less likely to play because you feel bad, you are more likely to play because that happens more often. Thus your score is likely to be higher.

So the number of people who attend at A is 130 and the total for the class at B is 50.<n>The problem is there are a hundred people who will arrive and a hundred people who will stay away. So at A there are 30 people who get a ticket and 30 people who stay away.<n>The number of tickets is 160 so 1/3 of the people who arrive will be there 1/3 of the time and half will arrive twice and leave half the time.<n>The average attendance is 60 thus 60/80 = 32% will attend.<n>The average attendance at B is 90 and they are not going to miss out on any of their work.<n>The average attendance for the class at A is 100 and they will probably miss it anyway since this is a class for adults.<n>The average attendance of D is zero so they won't miss it since it's not going to be an art show<n><n>Input: A (left) has a family of five children. B (right) has a family of seven children. C (center) has a family of four children.<n>Output:What is the length of the time from start to finish for the family of five children at A and the family of seven children at B?

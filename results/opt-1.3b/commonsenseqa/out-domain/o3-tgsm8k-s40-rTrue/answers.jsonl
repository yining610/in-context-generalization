The family will then need to eat an average of 8 oranges a week, including 2 oranges each day. What should the family buy each week to eat the average of 8 oranges?\n\nOutput: The family buys 9 oranges a week and eats an average of 8 oranges. The family purchases 2 boxes of oranges only for Mondays and eats an average of 2 oranges per day.\nThis will take away 2 oranges per week. Therefore, the family will have to buy 8 boxes of oranges a week.\nSince this will take away 2 oranges each week, the family will have two boxes of oranges for Mondays.\nSince the family will have 2 boxes of oranges, they will only need to buy 1 box of oranges the other 5 days of the week to eat an average of 7 oranges per week.\nTherefore, the family will have 7 boxes of oranges for Mondays, 5 boxes of oranges for Tuesdays, 2 boxes of oranges for Wednesdays, 3 boxes of oranges for Thursdays, and 3 boxes of oranges for Fridays.\nTherefore, the total amount of oranges the family can eat is:\n9 * 7 * 10 * 7 = 24\nSince each fruit costs $1, the total amount of money the family can save is $1\nThe total amount of oranges the the family can eat is 24 x 7 = >60 oranges\nTherefore, the total difference between the average of 7 oranges and the average of 8 oranges is:\n60 - 11 = <<60-11=9>>9\nSo the final answer for answer 2 is 56\n\nIn our previous example, the goal of the experiment was to produce a quantity of money which was proportional to the total value of the items that were taken.

{"text": "(A) The direction along which you might want to stand.  (B) The best place to stand for pedestrians who may cross in front of you.   (C) Best place to stand for cars who may stop right in front of you.\nSolution: Choose (A). People who stand at the intersection are more likely to stop for pedestrians than cars. At a light, cars may stop right in front and right behind you. At a crosswalk, you may stand out in front of other cars, but you may not be in a crosswalk at all times. At the corner, you may be in a corner where no right-turn lanes are available, in a busy crosswalk where people may suddenly stop or step aside and in an intersection where all lanes are available, where there will be many pedestrians with arms in the air. If you stand in the middle, it is possible that most people will be able to see you and most people will be able or willing to stop for you. If you stand in one of the lanes, it will be difficult to see pedestrians and/or drivers. If you stand at a crosswalk, both you and the pedestrians in front of you may be waiting for the light to turn green, or may be standing at the intersection waiting for it to clear. If you stand at the intersection alone, people may wait for a minute, or a few seconds, for you to turn around. If you stand at an intersection with sidewalks, people may move out of your way if you come to a stop.\nSolution: Choose one of the other 4. A car line is safer than a bicycle line. The sidewalk is safer than the crosswalk. The intersection has crosswalks.\n\nInput:Where do two men who are not related stand together in a line, and where do two men who are related stand together in the same line? Choices: A: a line D: a cross L: a river\nOutput:  (B) The direction that men may stand in, based on the length of their arms.\nSolution: Choose A. If a straight line is possible, men are more likely to stand in the same direction for a long time. However, the two men who are not on the same side of the line will not have much room to move. If a line was long enough, you would have more room to move in any direction. If you stand in some different direction, you may be moving to the right, but also to the left", "answer": "C: street corner"}

{"text": "B C D\nOn Monday, Sally opened the door to go into the bedroom, and the kitten jumped on top of her.  On Tuesday, the kitten jumped from the top of her to the table.\nOn Wednesday, the owner left the bedroom door open when she went into the bathroom.  The cat ran out.  On Thursday, the owner shut the door when visiting the bathroom.  The kitten ran out.  On Friday, the owner didn't go into the bathroom.  After a few seconds, the owner went in the bathroom, and the kitten ran out.  When the owner returned from her trip, the kitten ran to the door to the bathroom and jumped up on her as she stepped off the bathroom bench.  The owner closed the bathroom door when she entered the bedroom, and the cat didn't run out.  During this time, the cat jumped off the top of herself onto the bed and onto the floor.  Then the cat ran out.\nSo on each day in the three days, the owner didn't close the bedroom door and the kitten ran.  The owner didn't notice this during those three days.  Each day that the owner didn't notice the kitten running out of the room, Sally lost two steps.  If Sally had started this task before Friday, Sally would now have a cumulative total of 15 steps.\nSo on each of the three days Sally took no steps.  If Sally were a robot, she'd say that she could make no steps because it was a new object.  However, this task didn't involve getting an object on a new surface, it involved getting a cat onto a new surface.  Therefore, I doubt that she could make no additional steps.  Therefore, the final answer is 15\n\nInput: This chart shows the temperature change recorded on the first day the thermometer of an air conditioner was installed.

Jack left his luggage at a hotel and checked a bag. If he had six pieces of luggage, how many pieces did he need to check?\nOutput: Five + one equals 6. So the correct answer is 5.\nJack's luggage totaled six pieces.\nLet's say Jack had nine bags total.  He chose one bag to carry one key. So the keys were:  1. The one bag with one key 1+2. The one bag with two keys 3+4. The one bag with four keys 4+5. The one bag with six keys.\nSo Jack needs to travel five extra miles on his round trip trip to get to his next destination, 5+1+2+4+5=9. He needs to travel a total of 10 miles to get to his final destination.\nOn the way there, he picked one bag with 6 keys. So it was 10 plus one = 11. The car was worth 15, so it made 10 plus 10 = 11.\nOn the way back, he picked one bag. So it was 6 plus 1 = 7. The car was worth 17, so it made 7 plus 16 = 9.\nSo Jack's round trip trip was 11- 9 = 10\nSo 11 is a little too much for Jack. He decides not to travel 11 miles. He picks 3 bags. So the final destination was 7 + 7 = 9.\nThe trip from his hotel to his home was 7 + 7 = 11 miles, so he got back 7 + 7 = 11 + 1 = 8.\nSo there are 8 + 8 = 10. Jack now has only 8 miles of traveling left.\nThe correct answer is 8\n\nInput: If you could build a robot that could reach a 1:40 speed, what would be the key specifications?\nOutput: Speed, power, precision, strength, accuracy, and size\nSo the correct answer is Speed, Power, Precision, Strength, Accuracy", "answer": "D: grocery store"}

If he gets arrested, he gets arrested by the cops who beat up the cop who beat up the cop that beat up the cop who got killed by the guy who beat up the cop...etc.    Each day during his time in jail, Jim is assigned to one of four work units. Jim earns a dollar per day for each time he murders someone. This means Jim would have been assigned 3 + 6 = 21 units of work for each one of the following week's units of work. Jim also earns an additional 1.25 cents per each time he kills a prisoner from week to week. This means that Jim would have earned $5.00 + $1.25 = $6.50 per week for each week's work unit.

{"text": "A\n\nInput: Two blind men, James and John, each wear the goggles on each eye, and one man doesn't wear the goggles.  James and John are walking down the street. James says to John, \"I can see him, so he doesn't see me.\" Can you help James figure out which direction John should go based on which eye he is wearing the goggles?\nOutput: I guess since he can see through one of the goggles,  that wouldn't matter\n\nInput: I had John sit on a chair in front of four chairs and put a book on the table. He had to move the chair until no seat was available. John moved the chair to one of the four seats and put the book on the table. John is told of the other three seats. He has to sit on one of these seats before he can sit in the fourth seat.  To get to the fourth chair, John moves the chair left. John is now given the fourth seat beside the first seat. Do you think that moving one of the remaining seats made a different difference?  Or can you guess the fourth seat from one of John's previous answers?\nOutput: None\n\nInput: John and James are wearing the goggles. Both men can now see each other's pupils and pupils of other people.  If each man has different pupils between the two men, each man will say he can see the other person better or can see them well  or both.  Is it possible that both men are more able to see this or that person as they look at each other with their own eyes?

However he was so intelligent that he forgot many things that he heard. His main mistake was giving the French word for pleasure to the Germans in order to distinguish them from the Russians. He said this one word to differentiate Germans from Russians. He said, \"Insanity is doing the same thing again and again, and expecting different results.\" And he was right! The word for insanity, was \"Aufregung\". He was wrong on this as the word for insanities was \"Rationalisations\".\nIn this sentence, it is hard to tell what Freud was doing.\nIn some ways Freud was very rational and logical in his words. He was very logical, but in other ways Freud could be very irrational; He could be very rational, but he could also be very irrational; He was very rational, but he might even be a psycho.\nFreud was a very intelligent man, but he also made logical mistakes; Freud was at times logical, but he might sometimes be irrational.\nThis sentence says that Freud is a very logical, but he might also be an irrational man, which is not very logical or logical at the same time, as only logical people can tell when there is an insanity or rationalization.\nFreud, as a very high intellectual man, made many logical mistakes, but also many logical solutions; He was very logical and made many logical decisions, but in other cases was rational but also made many irrational decisions.\nSo Freud, as very intelligent man, made many logical and logical decisions, but also many irrational decisions; Freud was definitely a very strong rational rational man, but the same could also be said for him.\nOne of the reasons why Freud was a very difficult person to understand, was his rational thinking that could at times make Freud feel very irrational and irrational at the same time; He was very logical, and at times rational, but some times irrational; Freud was definitely a strong rational man, but at other times irrational; Freud was an extremely strong, but at times irrational logical, but also made irrational decisions and rationalizations.\nIn short, Freud", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

The bird can change its height between 12 and 20 inches at will by changing the bones in its feet. The bird can move its legs one at a time, but it can move each individual leg independently because each leg, when in the proper position, is aligned. In addition, the legs can change direction. If a person tries to move his arms while in a sitting position from a sitting position, the weight of the body will move the arms independently as it has the ability to do so. An eagle can move its legs and move its head independently of each other, but not its legs independently of each other. Its neck, which is normally used as a support for its wings and legs, is the most vulnerable part of the body and can swing freely only when it is in its natural habitat in the air. It is likely that an eagle's neck is one of its most sensitive points.

In an interview conducted on Wednesday they tell the story:  A: One of the kids in the school group came home with a piece of metal (that the children have never been told about) in her possession.  The school group members thought it was a piece of metal in an old desk.  They took the piece of metal (that they have never been told about), put it in her purse, and carried it the rest of the way to school.  B: When we got to the school, they informed the principal of the presence of the metal object.  The principal asked: (1) What is the object (the object that belonged to the child); and (2) If the object (object that belonged to the child) does not have a home on my campus is it my responsibility to find it and return it to the child?  C: They went to their teachers (who had never been given the object), told them that it was not their property, but that they did not know where the child found the object, and then handed it to the principal.  D: Two of the students brought the object to their teachers (who gave it to the principal). The principal asked: (C1) What is the property? (D) It really doesn't matter, because it's not yours.  E: One of the students went to the principal's office.

But, in fact, they did know where the object came from.  E: None of the students' parents were told about the incident.  The principal sent the object back to the school and asked for it to be returned to the child.  The principal informed them that if they ever bring something to school that they know that they can not take home without permission to go back and pick it up.

If the number 20 divided by the number 8 means the number of times the number 10 equals 100 and the number 20 means the number of times 8 equals 150, find the number of times the first number equals 100 (20 divided by 10) and the number of times the second number equals 150 (20 divided by 8) and then divide the square root of those two by 150 and multiply by the first number to get the number 10 divided by 8.  How many times do you get to double the square root? 1 x 3 = 2 x 3 = 7 and divide by three. 7 x 100 = 150 and 17 x 50 = 50 so this number is 70 divided by 6 then add the first and second numbers (70 divided by 6) and double the third number(70 divided by 7) multiplied by 6.\n\nInput: 2 times 15 x 8 times 12 x 4 is 90. 4 times 3 times 20 x 10 is 15.", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

{"text": "A melody will typically be used in a piece of music for two reasons. The first reason is that the notes are too close together or are on a loop. For instance, if the notes are A - F - C, the listener is probably not going to pay much attention to the A line or the F line. It is most likely the A, B and C that will be heard, not the higher notes like D or E. The second reason is to establish emotional resonance between the piano and the violin. The same thing is true for a melody in which the voice becomes the instrument. A melody with just as many notes as strings is much more likely to appear in a violin concerto than it is in an instrumental work. The last reason is that a melody is important to be used in film or television. A melody helps give the story a certain feel and atmosphere. The lyrics are important to make sure that the story and characters are believable, but sometimes they can not always be heard. The final reason is that notes sound better with a melody. The reason being, the lower notes sound better with one than another.\n\nInput:Dr. Banks has three patients who each receive monthly treatments for cancer. They each take 3 pills per day.

Because of this, it is easier A than B. Therefore, it is easier A to solve.\nOutput B: A is equal to 9 and 9 is equal to 4 and since (A/B) = (9/4) = (4/5) = 4.5, thus B/A = (4/5)/9 = 3.5. Therefore, B is easier than A. Therefore, B is equivalent to A in difficulty value. Therefore, B is also easier to solve.\nOutput C: A is equal to 45 because of its difficulty value. Because (A/45) = (45/5) = (45/10), it would be easier to solve A with 45 than with 50 because of its difficulty value and because of the value of 10 being equal to 45. Therefore, A is equivalent to 45. Therefore, if a new problem comes up, your older solution will be easier. Therefore, you should use A. Therefore, if a brand new problem comes up, you should use 45 not 50. Therefore, you should buy 45 instead of 50 for easy-solving.

{"text": "An intelligent, well-functioning person is empathic. They understand people better than their social surroundings can, and the better they understand people, the better they can understand themselves and thus will become more well-functioning themselves (e.g., see above). To be empathetic is to be able to understand people\u2019s emotional needs and desires and thus become empathic oneself, thus allowing one person to learn skills they might have never been able to.\nHow does a person become empathic? They need to see people\u2019s emotional traits and learn to feel empathy.\nHow does a well-functioning person become empathic? First, a person should become aware of their own emotions during their daily lives, as well as the emotions of others. Because emotions are difficult for people to understand, they must begin understanding them by listening to others. After understanding others\u2019 emotions, a person then wishes for other people to have empathy towards themselves. Next, people need to accept their own emotions, as well as those of others, and then allow themselves to be empathetic towards others. Finally, a person must find ways of letting go of their feelings and allowing others to let go of their feelings even if those feelings are unachievable. In this way, the emotional aspects of one\u2019s life and self become strengthened.\n\nInput: In his studies he found that one of the first things taught before getting a job was \"You will be responsible for the environment\" and then afterwards it was the people's \"Do what you're told\" which was then \"What you're expected to do\".\nOutput: It has been found that there isn't a large difference when it comes to which groups are taught \"You will be responsible and...What are you supposed to say to people?\" However, the people in the second group are found to be more responsible to everyone around them and also less disrespectful to the people around them.\n\nInput:What is the largest number you have seen in a large group, and was it less than 10?

How would you decide to make the same decision using only one card? What do you do with the coins in the tray? Are there coins in the envelope that you can't see? The number of coins in the envelope is 10. This is what you're holding. If you pick up the envelope without a card, how many coins will be wasted?\nOutput: You just place the envelope as you would a dollar bill.\nThe envelope is exactly that. There is 1.2*10^-9 coins in one piece. That's what you would spend if you don't have a card to pick up the envelope. 10 is 5 times 10, and 5 is the prime number.\nThe same exact answer applies to the coin tray. 10 is not 5 times 5. You only pick up one coin at a time. 10 would also be 5 times 5.\nThe problem is that there are only 10 coins in the envelope. If you want 10 coins, you need 10 coins. If you pick up just one coin at a time, of course you pick up 10 coins.\nThe total wasted coin quantity is 10^90. This is 5 * 10^9 + 5 * 10^9 = 10^90 - 5 * 10^9=55.\nThat's 2 / 10^9 - 5 * 10^8 = 55.\nSo the final total would be 55 * 10^9 - 5 + 5 * 10^8 + 2/10^9 = 2*10^9 + 2*5 = 10\nThat's a total of 10 * 10^9 + 10 * 10^9 - 2/10 ^9 = 5\nThere is 10.1*10^9 coins left\n\nInput: If you took only three pennies and added all of them to one penny, there would be a total of 15 pennies...\nOutput: There would be a total of 5 pennies!\nThe first thing you would add is 1.25.

Her husband, Richard, is the CEO of a $50-million-a-year company with $30 million in annual profit. He has three young children. Jane earns 15% interest on the company\u2019s stock. She is not looking for a long-term professional partnership, and has no intention to become his sole source of income. She has no plan to leave the company. With a 4% inflation yearly rate (the rate at which money becomes worth more than it was when it was created), Jane\u2019s stock can appreciate by 2.5% each year. The stock purchase agreement allows her to pay a flat annual fee, which is calculated as the difference between the company\u2019s annual sales and the company\u2019s asset value. In 2010 she began selling 90% of her stock\u2014the remaining 10% is her guaranteed payments (the company\u2019s profit and loss) plus 15% interest on a $1,000 investment. She sells the remaining 10% of her stock each year and receives 15% interest each year in interest payments. At age 75, at the age when she normally will need more income to live on, she will still receive 45% interest in interest. In 10 years she will receive 75% of her initial investment if her investment rises by 6% each year. What would be her greatest financial benefit from selling her stock, and how would these financial gains have been allocated had she sold her stock at the same time as her husband?\nOutput: Jane makes $30,000/year at her company and $21,000/year at age 55. Her husband earns $50 million of his company\u2019s annual profit of $30 million and makes $90 million in annual profit. His earnings from his $30 million-profit company would be $6.5 million, and his earnings from his $90 million-profit company would have been $2.7 million, resulting in total yearly earnings of $11.6 million.

The number of performers at a concert is then 5,000 * $1 = $5,000. Now suppose that $35 is given to each performer. In this case, the amount of money that is received from each performer is 6,000 * $1.20 * $5 = $56,000.\n\nInput: You need two people to work in a company. You hire one person each to do two parts of the service in order to work each service for the same amount of money. What is the total sum that the two people who are doing part A and part B cost to do service A & B? Output: $9,500, which is $5,000 for each service\n\nAssignment:\nThis is a simple version of question #1. The answers in the two questions are the same, however, the form is different.\n\nIn answer #1, you are given the total sum. You must subtract the total sum plus the money for the person that does service A which is $10 and the money for the person who does service B which is $5 therefore:\nTotal = $10 * 100 * 20 = $100\nSubstitution (20* 100) = $5 = $5, which is the total sum.\n\nThere are two ways to solve this assignment. Either you use $1 for both services or you use $1 for service A and $1 for service B. We will go with the second method as it is easier.\n\n$1 = $1 for service A ($10) + $1 = $1 for Service B ($5) = $5\n\nNext:\n\nIf we were going to subtract the money that we spent on the labor that went into the services A and B together, then we would subtract the money that we would give to the artists and the money that we would pay to the venue before the start of the concert (in answer #2 above). But, if we are just subtracting the money for the labor performed then we don't do that, since we already know the money before the labor.\n\nFor example:\n2.50 + 2.00 = $5.00\n2.25 + 2.00 = 5.25", "answer": "A: arena"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput:Dr. Banks had a bank vault in the basement at his office building, located on an island off the coast of New York City. He had built the vault by filling it with sandbags. He also built a special lock on one of the vault doors. He installed an alarm system and a surveillance system. The vault cost $10,000. The cost of getting insurance and employees was $10,000 each. The vault was built to withstand two feet of water.  At 10,634 feet by 19 feet, it was about as large as a football field. The vault was designed to stop robbery even if the robbers had a nuclear bomb. Dr. Banks was a very wealthy guy, so he put his entire fortune into the building. He had hired several construction firms to come in and renovate it for him. These contractors each paid $10,000 to $40,000 for each day they worked for him. The final price was $100,000 for 4,000 men to build the vault. The men only worked on his building in summer during the off-season so the construction would be easier on them.  He also hired a local architect to design the vault. Each day the architect took the measurements for the vault and did the drawings.  These were his drawings and he took the measurements at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. and reported them back to Dr. Banks by text message at the same time every day.

{"text": "The beaver uses a lot of wood to build structures. The wood he is using is about as heavy as a human at 1.13 kilograms. It uses about as much wood as a human can consume in less than 2 minutes but takes much longer to destroy.  Using a lot of wood means more space for water to flow between the wood and water. This means that there is less room for flooding, less space for flooding, which means there's less time spent on water, and less time spent dealing with water. This results in a higher river depth of 21 inches and flood heights around 25 inches, which is very comparable to the amount of space it takes to build the log.  So the final answer is 21 inches (12.75cm) or 2.5 yards (28cm)\n(30*1.2=48cm or 1.67 yards)\n\nInput: A blind man wears reading glasses.

For each day, the people were to be paid $100 for their time. If the man chose one of the people to do both the bedroom and the bathroom, the man would receive $200 each day. If the man chose two people each, the man would receive the above sum each day.\nAfter each day of cleaning, the man paid for half of it. Each time he put clothes away, he paid for the amount of those clothes that had been left. The man then paid for the amount of the towels that had been used for the day. He also paid for any extra cleaning that had to be done when he went to shower each day. If, after he got all this paid for, the bedroom and the bathroom looked presentable and clean, the man would get $100 each day. If the two bedrooms and the bathroom looked presentably clean for four days, the man would get another $200 each day. However, if the bedrooms did not look presentable for more than that, then the man would have to pay again. Every time the man got new clothes to put away and put the old clothes away properly, he paid for those clothes as well.\nHowever, if the bedrooms and the bathroom looked clean for a total of 10 days on each of the previous four cleanings, the man would receive another $200 each day\nThe total amount of $200 times 10 days x 10 days x 10 days = $360 and the man would get to keep all the money that had gone into his bank account on each cleanings.\nThe average time it took the man to get to each bathroom was about an hour. For the other bathrooms, however, the time could be considerably less, especially if at some stage on the next cleaning, the other bathrooms were tidied up.\nSo in total the man had to invest $180 worth of money to get $280 each day.\nThe total investment cost him less than 1% of his total income (if the rooms and the bathrooms had not seen much use from him during that time, he would have spent less).\nSo the final answer (from a purely financial standpoint) is 270.5\n\nInput:Five hundred thousand dollars are needed to solve a equation.

If a truck is passing overhead, should the front legs be touching the ground and the back legs touching the wall?\nInput: An elephant with seven legs stands on seven legs. It can travel at a speed of 1.5 mph. The elephant can travel at a speed up to 2.3 mph with only the bottom front leg touching the ground. The elephant can travel through walls at 2.2 miles per hour. The elephant can travel only one mile if it is traveling at a speed less than 5 mph. The elephant can always travel forward without touching the ground by moving directly from its front to back legs. The elephant can only move forward with a speed of 2.3 mph if it is traveling backward. The front legs will always be touching the ground because they are the only legs on the elephant but the back legs are not touching the ground because they must travel at least 1.5 miles before they can touch the ground.\nOutput: The animal stands on exactly seven legs. It must travel at a speed of 0.25 mph to reach a speed of 0.5 mph. It must travel at exactly 2.3 mph to travel through any object.

This means that our target population for our product will be composed of about 1/4 these new church members. Thus our market is about 1/4 the size. At the same time, we will be selling the same amount of our product to 1/4 the current members of the church. To do this we have to know the population at the current time, the number of new members of which are arriving and the number of departing. We can find this as the sum of the number of new members over the past year. Thus the population in the current year is divided by 100, and the number of new members is divided by the number of members of the church leaving. Since this number is the sum of all the numbers in the population on one year ago, we can work out what proportion they are leaving, and for this we can just subtract 100 from that number. However, we will not do that, so the population in the current and the future years will be:\n\nOutput:\n\nInput: We are selling 4 cans of tuna steaks.

The family will then need to eat an average of 8 oranges a week, including 2 oranges each day. What should the family buy each week to eat the average of 8 oranges?<n><n>Output: The family buys 9 oranges a week and eats an average of 8 oranges. The family purchases 2 boxes of oranges only for Mondays and eats an average of 2 oranges per day.<n>This will take away 2 oranges per week. Therefore, the family will have to buy 8 boxes of oranges a week.<n>Since this will take away 2 oranges each week, the family will have two boxes of oranges for Mondays.<n>Since the family will have 2 boxes of oranges, they will only need to buy 1 box of oranges the other 5 days of the week to eat an average of 7 oranges per week.<n>Therefore, the family will have 7 boxes of oranges for Mondays, 5 boxes of oranges for Tuesdays, 2 boxes of oranges for Wednesdays, 3 boxes of oranges for Thursdays, and 3 boxes of oranges for Fridays.<n>Therefore, the total amount of oranges the family can eat is:<n>9 * 7 * 10 * 7 = 24<n>Since each fruit costs $1, the total amount of money the family can save is $1<n>The total amount of oranges the the family can eat is 24 x 7 = >60 oranges<n>Therefore, the total difference between the average of 7 oranges and the average of 8 oranges is:<n>60 - 11 = <<60-11=9>>9<n>So the final answer for answer 2 is 56<n><n>In our previous example, the goal of the experiment was to produce a quantity of money which was proportional to the total value of the items that were taken.

So a man goes into the store and purchases the machine. The man is happy that he found such a "one-designer machine". He says to the salesman. "This is the one design that can wash everything."

The idea is that I am teaching a class and I would like my students to write a poem or creative story while I coach them on the craft and the craft tips.<n><n>How much money is the Teacher-Student exchange program?<n><n>I’d like the students to receive anywhere from $1000 to $15000 in the next exchange program.<n><n>How would you recommend I get my students started?<n><n>The teacher is going to send out an invitation on Saturday April 14th. On the invitation, the student is asked to make a video with the poem they chose and to list their thoughts. This is going to be on YouTube. Also, the teacher will list their ideas for an introduction to each poem, a description of their choice, and a poem outline for their essay.<n><n>There are no students in the class that are part of the scholarship?<n><n>Well, I would like you to think for a minute. Would anyone like to go to college? If there is anyone who would like to study the craft, yes, of course, why wouldn’t they? That being said, if I knew 100% of the kids who applied to college were going to go to college, would I? No, I don’t, that’s why I have the scholarship! I know that most students who did not qualify for the scholarship had to go in and request a slot anyways.<n><n>My classroom is in a good public school district, but the only two of my students who are applying to college are going to Duke University and the University of Virginia.<n><n>Ok, now what? We’ve set up the program and they’re off to make their video and list their thoughts. Now, the teacher is

One car can make one-third of a mile in ten seconds. How many miles does it take to make one-third of one mile? If you do the math, you would conclude: 3.06, assuming half the cars have 10 seconds per mile. The rest of the cars have 30 seconds per mile. This means in ten seconds, the last three cars would be behind the first three cars at 30 seconds per mile. If all cars were 30 seconds per mile, the last three cars travel a quarter of the miles. If three cars travel 35, 35 and 45 seconds per mile, their final distance is 47, 55 and 76 miles. They would have traveled a half mile each. Assuming a half mile is about three feet, that means the final total of the cars traveling is 76 miles. In the same time, all three cars traveling at the same speed would be traveling a quarter mile.

I think I really loved his teaching because he was a very serious teacher that showed us why we did something.  When he died in 2006 I still miss him.  He showed us how to stay in school, that it was an honor to be in front of the class as history teacher, etc.     B: I was only in fifth grade for four weeks before Mr. V. died, but he was my best teacher.  He always let me have the choice of doing what I felt like doing.  In other words, in Mr. V’s class we were all equal in our ability so we never argued about who was the best.  C: My favorite teacher was Dr. Schleicher who was in grade six when I started.  He challenged all of us to help our class learn our history.  Also, I did not know how hard it would be to be in fourth grade and come in fourth and fifth.  I did ok, but I knew I struggled because I was trying hard for my grade, whereas many students were more comfortable.  All teachers helped us learn our history, and I think that is why Mr. Schleicher taught me so much.  D: I loved every teacher I had, even though I know some would not necessarily agree.  I think that makes them very special because they are all different.<n><n>Input:

Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n>Output:		  (A) The direction along which you might want to stand.  (B) The best place to stand for pedestrians who may cross in front of you.   (C) Best place to stand for cars who may stop right in front of you.<n>Solution: Choose (A). People who stand at the intersection are more likely to stop for pedestrians than cars. At a light, cars may stop right in front and right behind you. At a crosswalk, you may stand out in front of other cars, but you may not be in a crosswalk at all times. At the corner, you may be in a corner where no right-turn lanes are available, in a busy crosswalk where people may suddenly stop or step aside and in an intersection where all lanes are available, where there will be many pedestrians with arms in the air. If you stand in the middle, it is possible that most people will be able to see you and most people will be able or willing to stop for you. If you stand in one of the lanes, it will be difficult to see pedestrians and/or drivers. If you stand at a crosswalk, both you and the pedestrians in front of you may be waiting for the light to turn green, or may be standing at the intersection waiting for it to clear. If you stand at the intersection alone, people may wait for a minute, or a few seconds, for you to turn around. If you stand at an intersection with sidewalks, people may move out of your way if you come to a stop.<n>Solution: Choose one of the other 4. A car line is safer than a bicycle line. The sidewalk is safer than the crosswalk. The intersection has crosswalks.<n><n>Input:Where do two men who are not related stand together in a line, and where do two men who are related stand together in the same line? Choices: A: a line D: a cross L: a river<n>Output:  (B) The direction that men may stand in, based on the length of their arms.<n>Solution: Choose A. If a straight line is possible, men are more likely to stand in the same direction for a long time. However, the two men who are not on the same side of the line will not have much room to move. If a line was long enough, you would have more room to move in any direction. If you stand in some different direction, you may be moving to the right, but also to the left

He knows that it will be a good fit and he has experience, but he doesn't have all the qualifications that they're asking for, so he's worried about what? Choices:  A: acceptance B: rejection C: hope D: less sleep E: employment<n>Output:		 Acceptance > Denial > Acceptance > Denial<n>When Jim applies for a job, he has applied with a number of different programs and interviewed with at least 6 different companies. He has been very careful when he's applied for a job, so he isn't worried about being rejected or he is worried that he got the job. He knows that with a job like this, the company will try to get as many people as they can to bring in customers. It does not matter whether or not anyone gets a job through Jim's application, because if he's not there, there's no chance that anyone would be there.<n>The only potential problem is that even if a person gets a job with Jim, he wouldn't enjoy being there. He might feel bad because he's being interviewed and thinks he's being treated unfairly. At this point, he's not totally confident that he'll get any job, so he worries that he may feel worse than he needs to being there all day.<n>The only real problem is that James's dream job that they're hiring him for will be great job, so he is not worried about anything else. To try to counter that, Jim is going to sleep less than required.<n>The total number of hours that Jim sleeps in a week is only 0.48 of the total number of hours required to get the job. James is not totally confident about getting the job, so he wants to sleep less than he has to.<n>The final answer is 0.48<n><n>Input:Three hundred men attended a course to build houses.

He calls his car service company and asks them to call his mechanic.  The mechanic calls and informs him that he will be out within an hour because he's "out of gas" while he waits for his gas station to open.  Finally, the mechanic gets in touch with the man's home services installer and they schedule an appointment to correct his tire pressure gauge.  When the mechanic arrives he says "You have a car?"  "Yes, but it doesn't have gas." (You can guess which answer was wrong.)  The mechanic tells the man.  "You need to call me back with the gas gauge reading."  The man tells the mechanic that it hasn't worked since they took the tire off and put it back on the car.  The mechanic then tells the man that the gauge doesn't have to be in a tight position, the pressure can be very high without causing an issue. The man says, "Is that right?"  "Yes, sir."  The mechanic then asks, "Is the gauge running now?"  The man responds, "It's running and it's not doing anything

There was a target on the wall for him to bounce against.  Where might he be? Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		 Pool table<n>Billy bounced off the wall for one of 15 balls that he could pick up.  If he picked up the ball and brought it into his playroom, that was where he was.<n>The first 10 balls he picked up would be thrown to the floor and the last 15 balls would be thrown down the wall where the target was. The target on the wall was always 15 feet away, whether Billy was in the playroom or on the play table in front of the TV.<n>When he didn't see the target, he picked up the ball.<n>Billy bounced the ball 10 times, picking up the third ball along the way along with the first 10 balls.  If he threw every ball of the target over the wall, he would have come up with the first 15 balls.<n>But after picking up the first ball, the second ball followed and so did the third ball and the fourth ball and so on. When Billy picked up the 5th ball, the 6th ball followed.  When he picked up the 7th ball, the 8th ball followed.  If every one of those 15 balls is thrown over the wall, he comes up with the next 15 balls.<n>After picking up the 7th ball and the 8th ball, Billy picked up the 9th ball and the 10th ball, and so on.<n>After picking up all 15 balls, Billy would have reached an area about 9 feet in diameter.  After throwing out the 9th ball over the walls, he had 6 more balls to pick up. But when Billy did that, the ball bounced right back over the wall, hitting the ceiling and landing near a window on the ceiling.<n>Billy picked up the ball and tossed it out of sight behind the window back into the play room. Billy then came out and stood at the window behind the window.<n>Billy then came in and picked up the 10th ball.  The 11th ball was tossed out and when it landed in the same spot as the 10th ball, a third ball arrived. Billy stood at the window behind all three balls.<n>There were 13 balls left in the pool table, with 10 in the pool table.  If there were 15 balls (the other 12 balls in the playroom), Billy has a 6 1/2 to 7 3/4 foot area to pick them up. After throwing each ball one at a time, Billy's area to pick up the rest of the balls is about 8 feet across. Billy's time would not be as fast

On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Output: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>So the final answer is 54<n><n>Input:If people are vegetarian, what do they do more of? Choices:  A: believe in god B: sun themselves C: eat hamburgers D: gain wealth E: eat plants<n>Output:		 Vegetarians make up 7.7% of the US population and the number of vegetarians who are not vegetarian is 1/13.6 million.  Since 1 is less than 2; the vegetarian is 1.7% of the population. So the vegetarian represents 7.7% of American population.<n><n>Input: If you cut off a finger, who can see the whole hand?<n>Output: The severed part can still see, so there’s a 2% chance that person can still help you.  There’s a 1% chance they won’t be able to recognize you; that person will become the person who cuts off your finger.  For example, if the guy at the checkout with the cut finger can’t recognize you – they’ll get the guy at the register and cut your finger off.  So there’s a 1 in 2.7 chance that the person who cuts off the finger can be you; 1 in 67,600 chance that the person who chopped off the finger is either you or the guy who cut off the finger.<n><n>Input:In a country divided into two, the population which has a higher density is less likely to lose population. In other words a given country with two different densities has more chance of increasing population. So if you have a population which is divided into two equal parts, the denser one has higher chance of increasing population. Which part has more chance of growing larger population?<n>Output: With equal populations this is true.  However, a city with higher density has a higher chance of losing population. So let’s say the population in a city with high density is 20 people. The population of the county with lower density is 500 people. The population of city with high density is 3,000 people.<n><n>Input:A bird can fly two ways for ten consecutive days without flapping. Two birds can fly to the same place, but one bird can fly all the way to the other country. If so, the second bird knows where the other bird would be flying so he’ll fly in that direction. When one bird flies in the opposite direction, he will fly away faster than the other. If the one bird is left behind, the one who left will die and will not be able to get to the other bird, so his body’s energy will be spent so he will eventually die of old age. Which do you think is the real explanation, and how does that

Choices:  A: opened B: closed C: found at shower D: falling down E: locked<n>Output:		 B C D<n>On Monday, Sally opened the door to go into the bedroom, and the kitten jumped on top of her.  On Tuesday, the kitten jumped from the top of her to the table.<n>On Wednesday, the owner left the bedroom door open when she went into the bathroom.  The cat ran out.  On Thursday, the owner shut the door when visiting the bathroom.  The kitten ran out.  On Friday, the owner didn't go into the bathroom.  After a few seconds, the owner went in the bathroom, and the kitten ran out.  When the owner returned from her trip, the kitten ran to the door to the bathroom and jumped up on her as she stepped off the bathroom bench.  The owner closed the bathroom door when she entered the bedroom, and the cat didn't run out.  During this time, the cat jumped off the top of herself onto the bed and onto the floor.  Then the cat ran out.<n>So on each day in the three days, the owner didn't close the bedroom door and the kitten ran.  The owner didn't notice this during those three days.  Each day that the owner didn't notice the kitten running out of the room, Sally lost two steps.  If Sally had started this task before Friday, Sally would now have a cumulative total of 15 steps.<n>So on each of the three days Sally took no steps.  If Sally were a robot, she'd say that she could make no steps because it was a new object.  However, this task didn't involve getting an object on a new surface, it involved getting a cat onto a new surface.  Therefore, I doubt that she could make no additional steps.  Therefore, the final answer is 15<n><n>Input: This chart shows the temperature change recorded on the first day the thermometer of an air conditioner was installed.

He can't remember the names of their places, the man then goes home and searches the internet for their cities by name. He finds out where they go, but he does not know what they do. He asks them because he wants to go to their places. When asked what they do, the men tell him that there is a special bar in which they sit during the day and go out at night to the dance. Then he asks his father, who lives out in the countryside why these places are special for them. The father tells him that when he was young the owners of these places would hire men to go into the country and play ball and run errands. As the men were going into towns they would hire those that were very good at playing ball to come and work for them. The father then tells his son that when he would become very old, if he ever was to go back to the towns where he had played ball and run errands, he might find out the answers to all of the questions that he has asked. When the men finished talking, they all began dancing. Later that night another man came to the party with a big bucket, filled with beer, and a guitar. He would sit there for hours and play while everyone else played at home. When the second man came, the others asked to borrow the guitar, and the man told them that he couldn't give it to them because it was his mother's and because it belonged to a man that died in a war. They left angry with him. The next morning when the man got up the bucket that he had put the beer from had been moved. On the inside of the bucket was a small wooden drum. When the man opened it, on the outside of the bucket was a large wooden drum. On the outside is a small wooden drum that contains the same beer that he left at home.

The words “she can’t afford” do not cause the statement to be wrong.

Answer each question with at least one answer. When an animal has a problem (thirst), if it will consume more than its body weight in water, how will it die? What will happen to its body?<n>Output: A cow can drink 2 feet of water a day and should drink no more than 15 inches of water per day. Since water must come from a source that is not a mountain, then a cow can drink only 15 inches per day. Because cattle are water birds, their bodies would dehydrate and die within days if they did not drink water. Most cattle in South America don’t drink water either. So this is a false answer to the question.<n><n>Input; The U.S. has three states, Louisiana, Maine and Vermont. Each state has three times more people than the total population of the United States.

How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Output: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>So the final answer is 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Output: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>So the final answer is 54<n><n>Input:If I need deodorant, where do I go to but some?

Jack left his luggage at a hotel and checked a bag. If he had six pieces of luggage, how many pieces did he need to check?<n>Output: Five + one equals 6. So the correct answer is 5.<n>Jack's luggage totaled six pieces.<n>Let's say Jack had nine bags total.  He chose one bag to carry one key. So the keys were:  1. The one bag with one key 1+2. The one bag with two keys 3+4. The one bag with four keys 4+5. The one bag with six keys.<n>So Jack needs to travel five extra miles on his round trip trip to get to his next destination, 5+1+2+4+5=9. He needs to travel a total of 10 miles to get to his final destination.<n>On the way there, he picked one bag with 6 keys. So it was 10 plus one = 11. The car was worth 15, so it made 10 plus 10 = 11.<n>On the way back, he picked one bag. So it was 6 plus 1 = 7. The car was worth 17, so it made 7 plus 16 = 9.<n>So Jack's round trip trip was 11- 9 = 10<n>So 11 is a little too much for Jack. He decides not to travel 11 miles. He picks 3 bags. So the final destination was 7 + 7 = 9.<n>The trip from his hotel to his home was 7 + 7 = 11 miles, so he got back 7 + 7 = 11 + 1 = 8.<n>So there are 8 + 8 = 10. Jack now has only 8 miles of traveling left.<n>The correct answer is 8<n><n>Input: If you could build a robot that could reach a 1:40 speed, what would be the key specifications?<n>Output: Speed, power, precision, strength, accuracy, and size<n>So the correct answer is Speed, Power, Precision, Strength, Accuracy

A human is asleep in a bed. When a human goes to bed and goes back to sleep, they make one of the following noise patterns:<n>At the beginning of the night, a human is in a deep sleep (snore, relaxation). A human's throat then closes because the air does. A human will become a deep sleep on its own by morning.<n>The next time a human goes to sleep and goes back to sleep (loss of consciousness), it's still in deep sleep. Then a human will start making a snoring sound because it has a sore throat. Since it's in deep sleep, the first sound they make is a snort of air. A human who goes to sleep with a sore breath stops breathing. When that happens, they would fall into a full sleep because they're in deep sleep, too.<n>The next time they go to sleep (snoring sound), they start making a loud snorting sound.

What is fair for the playing team? Outcome: A sub is not allowed to play in their sub. If an active sub must play in order for the game to start, it takes away the chance for a sub to play. If one team has to start each side at the same time, then there may be unequal playing field, resulting in unfair games. In that case, the playing team can have subs until the game starts. The sub that plays in each game is the same and they each get the same amount of points. However, the points of each team member can have different values since many substitutions can occur each game. To further prove, if a sub is allowed, then they may as well count their subs as a starting team member of the sub team and not allow other subs. Because

This problem shows how hard we are working to remember a number of words. We are making new associations on the fly.<n>After we are able to do word association, we can move on to the memory memory game. The memory memory game shows that we can make some memory mistakes. We will be able to correct those mistakes after we understand the problem.<n>First, we need to try to remember that the question says we will be looking for people in a certain location. We need to make associations with certain words. Words that are similar to the location are common. These words are used to make associations and therefore we need to remember the word association that were made. The other words can be thought of as the people who have the places of the location. So for example, if we wanted to find someone in the hospital, we would make associations with "hospital" and "hospital beds." We also need to make associations with phrases that are used when people are looking for someone. The following are some association suggestions: hospital is for someone in need of help, a hospital bed is for someone injured, and a hospital visit is for a visit from the doctor.<n>Now, we need to think about the location. We can say "Where can I find people who have the hospital bed or the

One man spends $120 on the bottle of wine then asks for a glass of beer. The other two men ask for a bottle of wine and a pitcher of beer. The man buying the wine asks for another glass and keeps the bottle of beer. The man giving the beer order then asks for another glass and the bottle is passed from bar to bar. The difference of the money spent for alcohol is -40<n>After each glass of beer the money spent on wine is increased to $40 or -40$ since each glass is more expensive than the last. If all the money spent on beer is removed from the total then the total is added to the total of $240. Then the amount of wine left in the bottle is calculated from the total by adding a whole dollar to the amount spent on wine. There is $40 left in the bottle of wine. The total of $240 is then added to the total of -80 $40$. The total of 80 $40$ is 10 times 4 = 100$ 100 / 10 = 1$. The total of $100 is 100 times 3 = $640. The total of $680 = 60% increase in the amount of money a single dollar can buy since alcohol

She yelled at him not to leave his things where? Choices:  A: toy store B: hall C: bathroom D: amusement park E: fairgrounds<n>Output:		  Billy's mother yelled at him not to touch an amusement park object. Since the toys were on the ground, he could not touch a toy store object. Instead, he could take his money and throw it at an amusement park item. An amusement park object is a ride or attractions. Therefore, he could take his savings and throw it at a ride or attractions. Billy's savings were not in his pocket. Therefore, the money he could lose was not enough for him to leave his property unsupervised.<n>So the final question is : If he took his savings with him and threw it at rides? Billy's savings would be less than his lost earnings. Therefore, the loss is not good enough to allow him to leave his property unattended.   Therefore, he is not allowed to leave his property unattained.    If he left his property after his savings have left along with the ride? Billy's savings would still be less than his losses. Therefore, he could still leave without giving the ride back to the employee.   Thus, the loss does not allow him to leave his premises unattended.<n>Therefore and only therefore, Billy's mother yelled at Billy not to touch an amusement area / amusement park object.<n><n>Input: A bill is due for money that was given as compensation.

They were always at war with each other. It was never anything John wanted. John's mother never wanted anything John wanted. She never took advantage of him. She never allowed him to treat her or anyone else with whatever he wanted. Finally, he asked her if she knew how old he was. She said, "That's no business of yours." "We are in this business together. When are we going to be together again?" The nurse told the man that she did not know. The man said, "How are we going to be friends again if you just don't know how old we are?" It is John's business and is nobody else's business.

It helps the eyes move through the text easier.<n><n>In conclusion, can you help me make a few changes:<n>1. Maybe say if you get the answer you think is going to be right.<n>2. You could have the number of Dobermans that you use per question be more obvious or just the number of dogs. This will help students feel more interested in the question but it will also help students to try to solve the problem quickly.<n>3. And when students feel like they can solve the problem, you could make it more obvious.<n>I also like having more questions than just the 5. It keeps the teacher motivated.<n>Also, when writing the example you don't say if the teacher will be teaching the students this. I have seen these answers in some other questions before, and I know that sometimes the teacher will be teaching students how to solve the answer. I think this would help with students' memory.<n><n>1.I'll come back with feedback in writing if people don't feel satisfied by this.<n>2.If people aren't satisfied with this, how would they be able to figure out how many Dobermans are in this

She didn’t have an emergency contact, so she called the police to have them come and take a look. After that, the girlfriend was gone and the son stayed at his grandmother’s house for a week. When he went home from the grandmother’s, the girlfriend stayed behind, so he had to leave. His mother was furious. The boy was 18 and they live rent-free together.

His mom gave him $400.00 as a gift that day and promised she would be there in case he needed her (he didn’t). The next day, his mother called him and told him about the police and to check his messages.

What might the cops do to him? Choices:  A: going to jail B: going to prison C: beat him up D: get arrested E: die<n>Output:		  Jim enjoyed killing people, so he goes to jail. If he kills a cop, he goes to prison and gets beaten up by every cop at the same time. If he gets arrested, he gets arrested by the cops who beat up the cop who beat up the cop that beat up the cop who got killed by the guy who beat up the cop...etc.    Each day during his time in jail, Jim is assigned to one of four work units. Jim earns a dollar per day for each time he murders someone. This means Jim would have been assigned 3 + 6 = 21 units of work for each one of the following week's units of work. Jim also earns an additional 1.25 cents per each time he kills a prisoner from week to week. This means that Jim would have earned $5.00 + $1.25 = $6.50 per week for each week's work unit. Because he will also earn an additional 4 cents per each time he hits a prisoner, Jim could have sold each one of his prisoners for $6.50 plus extra 2 or 3 cents per each time. If he sold them all, he could have earned more than $12, but only made $4.40 (the cost of one of his units of work) or an additional 4.5 or 5 cents for each prisoner.

James and John are walking down the street. James says to John, "I can see him, so he doesn't see me." Can you help James figure out which direction John should go based on which eye he is wearing the goggles?<n>Output: I guess since he can see through one of the goggles,  that wouldn't matter<n><n>Input: I had John sit on a chair in front of four chairs and put a book on the table. He had to move the chair until no seat was available. John moved the chair to one of the four seats and put the book on the table. John is told of the other three seats. He has to sit on one of these seats before he can sit in the fourth seat.  To get to the fourth chair, John moves the chair left. John is now given the fourth seat beside the first seat. Do you think that moving one of the remaining seats made a different difference?  Or can you guess the fourth seat from one of John's previous answers?<n>Output: None<n><n>Input: John and James are wearing the goggles. Both men can now see each other's pupils and pupils of other people.  If each man has different pupils between the two men, each man will say he can see the other person better or can see them well  or both.  Is it possible that both men are more able to see this or that person as they look at each other with their own eyes?  (In other words, John is more able to see the pupils in his eyes than in the eyes of James.)<n>Output: I guess you could say that they are more able to see each other<n><n>Input: John has to talk to James in a specific language, whereas James has to talk to John.

On the other hand, James is talking to John in French or Spanish.  John's English does not have the word "french" in it. Does it make a difference if each man hears "can", "dude" or "dude" being used?  How about "tss" ("yoo ah

Choices:  A: launch pad B: circus C: aircraft carrier D: large open area E: space station<n>Output:		 Mobile Launch Platform C<n>Suppose there's a mobile launch platform found in the ocean. A large part of its function could be for a child to launch a balloon into the air on it. What could be its purpose if it is unable to launch the balloon? What could be its purpose in launching an object into the air which is too heavy or complex for a child to maneuver on their own? What is its function if it is impossible to launch the object into the air?<n>Solution #2<n>Input: A car can be moved by a driver on the back of it while it is travelling. A car has a steering wheel, pedals, handlebars, an accelerator and brakes.<n>Output: An iphone is a very capable mobile device that can be powered by a car, but it must take the person driving it to and from their home. There are thousands of options here and each of them can be thought of as a mobile launch platform. The following two examples give the best answers to the questions given in the first question.<n>Solution #1<n>Input: An airplane has 8 wheels and is attached to a fixed wing fuselage. It is called: A: a fixed wing B: monoplane C: float plane D: airplane<n>Output: A: airplane<n>The car moves on the back of the plane. The engine on the car is controlled by the pilot. The car moves like a float plane. When it gets to the top of the stairs, the car returns to the plane. The plane drives on the top of the stairs. The propeller on the car moves like an aircraft propeller. When the aircraft turns off the propeller it is called: an iphone is capable of flying like a monoplane B: an airplane. It can go up in the air and then go down in it.<n>Solution #2<n>Output: A mobile launching platform finds its way to the sea using ocean currents. Can it be pushed by a ship? (i.e. a ship can launch the launching platform from its deck into the air)<n>Solution #1<n>Output: A mobile launch platform is not pushed by a ship. Its weight is too great to be pushed by a ship.<n>Suppose a ship moves toward a mobile launching platform. If the ship pushes the launching platform down instead of up, then the platform will rise and reach the ship. It will then launch itself out of the ship's deck. This will be very similar to the ship pushing itself down.<n>Solution #2

However he was so intelligent that he forgot many things that he heard. His main mistake was giving the French word for pleasure to the Germans in order to distinguish them from the Russians. He said this one word to differentiate Germans from Russians. He said, "Insanity is doing the same thing again and again, and expecting different results." And he was right! The word for insanity, was "Aufregung". He was wrong on this as the word for insanities was "Rationalisations".<n>In this sentence, it is hard to tell what Freud was doing.<n>In some ways Freud was very rational and logical in his words. He was very logical, but in other ways Freud could be very irrational; He could be very rational, but he could also be very irrational; He was very rational, but he might even be a psycho.<n>Freud was a very intelligent man, but he also made logical mistakes; Freud was at times logical, but he might sometimes be irrational.<n>This sentence says that Freud is a very logical, but he might also be an irrational man, which is not very logical or logical at the same time, as only logical people can tell when there is an insanity or rationalization.<n>Freud, as a very high intellectual man, made many logical mistakes, but also many logical solutions; He was very logical and made many logical decisions, but in other cases was rational but also made many irrational decisions.<n>So Freud, as very intelligent man, made many logical and logical decisions, but also many irrational decisions; Freud was definitely a very strong rational rational man, but the same could also be said for him.<n>One of the reasons why Freud was a very difficult person to understand, was his rational thinking that could at times make Freud feel very irrational and irrational at the same time; He was very logical, and at times rational, but some times irrational; Freud was definitely a strong rational man, but at other times irrational; Freud was an extremely strong, but at times irrational logical, but also made irrational decisions and rationalizations.<n>In short, Freud

The bird can change its height between 12 and 20 inches at will by changing the bones in its feet. The bird can move its legs one at a time, but it can move each individual leg independently because each leg, when in the proper position, is aligned. In addition, the legs can change direction. If a person tries to move his arms while in a sitting position from a sitting position, the weight of the body will move the arms independently as it has the ability to do so. An eagle can move its legs and move its head independently of each other, but not its legs independently of each other. Its neck, which is normally used as a support for its wings and legs, is the most vulnerable part of the body and can swing freely only when it is in its natural habitat in the air. It is likely that an eagle's neck is one of its most sensitive points. If an eagle is held at arms length, it can be moved around, but it is very difficult and dangerous to maneuver it in the water.<n>Input:An elephant has six legs on each side of its body and five on each arm.

In an interview conducted on Wednesday they tell the story:  A: One of the kids in the school group came home with a piece of metal (that the children have never been told about) in her possession.  The school group members thought it was a piece of metal in an old desk.  They took the piece of metal (that they have never been told about), put it in her purse, and carried it the rest of the way to school.  B: When we got to the school, they informed the principal of the presence of the metal object.  The principal asked: (1) What is the object (the object that belonged to the child); and (2) If the object (object that belonged to the child) does not have a home on my campus is it my responsibility to find it and return it to the child?  C: They went to their teachers (who had never been given the object), told them that it was not their property, but that they did not know where the child found the object, and then handed it to the principal.  D: Two of the students brought the object to their teachers (who gave it to the principal). The principal asked: (C1) What is the property? (D) It really doesn't matter, because it's not yours.  E: One of the students went to the principal's office.  The principal asked, "What is the question of the day?" (C2) I will not be able to speak to you today because there are too many students around me."  F: The students told the principal (in front of the whole class) that they didn't mean the metal in the desk.  But, in fact, they did know where the object came from.  E: None of the students' parents were told about the incident.  The principal sent the object back to the school and asked for it to be returned to the child.  The principal informed them that if they ever bring something to school that they know that they can not take home without permission to go back and pick it up.  However, if the object was brought into school by mistake (i.e., from home), the school should notify the child's parents.<n>Input(s): A: a ball in a container<n>B: soccer field<n>C: soccer game<n>D: central park<n>E:

Choices:  A: fridge B: a classroom C: envelope D: medical chart E: sheet music<n>Output:		A melody will typically be used in a piece of music for two reasons. The first reason is that the notes are too close together or are on a loop. For instance, if the notes are A - F - C, the listener is probably not going to pay much attention to the A line or the F line. It is most likely the A, B and C that will be heard, not the higher notes like D or E. The second reason is to establish emotional resonance between the piano and the violin. The same thing is true for a melody in which the voice becomes the instrument. A melody with just as many notes as strings is much more likely to appear in a violin concerto than it is in an instrumental work. The last reason is that a melody is important to be used in film or television. A melody helps give the story a certain feel and atmosphere. The lyrics are important to make sure that the story and characters are believable, but sometimes they can not always be heard. The final reason is that notes sound better with a melody. The reason being, the lower notes sound better with one than another.<n><n>Input:Dr. Banks has three patients who each receive monthly treatments for cancer. They each take 3 pills per day.

Because of this, it is easier A than B. Therefore, it is easier A to solve.<n>Output B: A is equal to 9 and 9 is equal to 4 and since (A/B) = (9/4) = (4/5) = 4.5, thus B/A = (4/5)/9 = 3.5. Therefore, B is easier than A. Therefore, B is equivalent to A in difficulty value. Therefore, B is also easier to solve.<n>Output C: A is equal to 45 because of its difficulty value. Because (A/45) = (45/5) = (45/10), it would be easier to solve A with 45 than with 50 because of its difficulty value and because of the value of 10 being equal to 45. Therefore, A is equivalent to 45. Therefore, if a new problem comes up, your older solution will be easier. Therefore, you should use A. Therefore, if a brand new problem comes up, you should use 45 not 50. Therefore, you should buy 45 instead of 50 for easy-solving. Therefore, you should try to solve 45 instead of 50 because it is easier. Therefore, when you get stuck, I would prefer A. When you are stuck, I would prefer 50, but I would not do it unless my options are 45 or 50. Therefore,

Choices:  A: copy B: intelligent C: improved performance D: empowering E: have more knowledge<n>Output:		 An intelligent, well-functioning person is empathic. They understand people better than their social surroundings can, and the better they understand people, the better they can understand themselves and thus will become more well-functioning themselves (e.g., see above). To be empathetic is to be able to understand people’s emotional needs and desires and thus become empathic oneself, thus allowing one person to learn skills they might have never been able to.<n>How does a person become empathic? They need to see people’s emotional traits and learn to feel empathy.<n>How does a well-functioning person become empathic? First, a person should become aware of their own emotions during their daily lives, as well as the emotions of others. Because emotions are difficult for people to understand, they must begin understanding them by listening to others. After understanding others’ emotions, a person then wishes for other people to have empathy towards themselves. Next, people need to accept their own emotions, as well as those of others, and then allow themselves to be empathetic towards others. Finally, a person must find ways of letting go of their feelings and allowing others to let go of their feelings even if those feelings are unachievable. In this way, the emotional aspects of one’s life and self become strengthened.<n><n>Input: In his studies he found that one of the first things taught before getting a job was "You will be responsible for the environment" and then afterwards it was the people's "Do what you're told" which was then "What you're expected to do".<n>Output: It has been found that there isn't a large difference when it comes to which groups are taught "You will be responsible and...What are you supposed to say to people?"

How would you decide to make the same decision using only one card? What do you do with the coins in the tray? Are there coins in the envelope that you can't see? The number of coins in the envelope is 10. This is what you're holding. If you pick up the envelope without a card, how many coins will be wasted?<n>Output: You just place the envelope as you would a dollar bill.<n>The envelope is exactly that. There is 1.2*10^-9 coins in one piece. That's what you would spend if you don't have a card to pick up the envelope. 10 is 5 times 10, and 5 is the prime number.<n>The same exact answer applies to the coin tray. 10 is not 5 times 5. You only pick up one coin at a time. 10 would also be 5 times 5.<n>The problem is that there are only 10 coins in the envelope. If you want 10 coins, you need 10 coins. If you pick up just one coin at a time, of course you pick up 10 coins.<n>The total wasted coin quantity is 10^90. This is 5 * 10^9 + 5 * 10^9 = 10^90 - 5 * 10^9=55.<n>That's 2 / 10^9 - 5 * 10^8 = 55.<n>So the final total would be 55 * 10^9 - 5 + 5 * 10^8 + 2/10^9 = 2*10^9 + 2*5 = 10<n>That's a total of 10 * 10^9 + 10 * 10^9 - 2/10 ^9 = 5<n>There is 10.1*10^9 coins left<n><n>Input: If you took only three pennies and added all of them to one penny, there would be a total of 15 pennies...<n>Output: There would be a total of 5 pennies!<n>The first thing you would add is 1.25. You then add 30 more pennies. That's 5 + 30 * 90 = 90<n>You then add 15 more pennies. That is 10 + 15 * 180 = 300.<n>If you do this 15 times, you will have 10 and 20 pennies. If you add them together, you get 10 and 15

Her husband, Richard, is the CEO of a $50-million-a-year company with $30 million in annual profit. He has three young children. Jane earns 15% interest on the company’s stock. She is not looking for a long-term professional partnership, and has no intention to become his sole source of income. She has no plan to leave the company. With a 4% inflation yearly rate (the rate at which money becomes worth more than it was when it was created), Jane’s stock can appreciate by 2.5% each year. The stock purchase agreement allows her to pay a flat annual fee, which is calculated as the difference between the company’s annual sales and the company’s asset value. In 2010 she began selling 90% of her stock—the remaining 10% is her guaranteed payments (the company’s profit and loss) plus 15% interest on a $1,000 investment. She sells the remaining 10% of her stock each year and receives 15% interest each year in interest payments. At age 75, at the age when she normally will need more income to live on, she will still receive 45% interest in interest. In 10 years she will receive 75% of her initial investment if her investment rises by 6% each year. What would be her greatest financial benefit from selling her stock, and how would these financial gains have been allocated had she sold her stock at the same time as her husband?<n>Output: Jane makes $30,000/year at her company and $21,000/year at age 55. Her husband earns $50 million of his company’s annual profit of $30 million and makes $90 million in annual profit. His earnings from his $30 million-profit company would be $6.5 million, and his earnings from his $90 million-profit company would have been $2.7 million, resulting in total yearly earnings of $11.6 million. These earnings from the couple’s $50 million-profit company and $90 million-profit companies are equal to their yearly gross income at their company, which is $18.8 million per year. As their income increases, their stocks must

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n>Output:		 If we go around the block the size of New York (10 x 10 m) and count the performers, then we find 5,000. Now suppose we decide to give the performers a dollar, so we make $5 per performer. The number of performers at a concert is then 5,000 * $1 = $5,000. Now suppose that $35 is given to each performer. In this case, the amount of money that is received from each performer is 6,000 * $1.20 * $5 = $56,000.<n><n>Input: You need two people to work in a company. You hire one person each to do two parts of the service in order to work each service for the same amount of money. What is the total sum that the two people who are doing part A and part B cost to do service A & B? Output: $9,500, which is $5,000 for each service<n><n>Assignment:<n>This is a simple version of question #1. The answers in the two questions are the same, however, the form is different.<n><n>In answer #1, you are given the total sum. You must subtract the total sum plus the money for the person that does service A which is $10 and the money for the person who does service B which is $5 therefore:<n>Total = $10 * 100 * 20 = $100<n>Substitution (20* 100) = $5 = $5, which is the total sum.<n><n>There are two ways to solve this assignment. Either you use $1 for both services or you use $1 for service A and $1 for service B. We will go with the second method as it is easier.<n><n>$1 = $1 for service A ($10) + $1 = $1 for Service B ($5) = $5<n><n>Next:<n><n>If we were going to subtract the money that we spent on the labor that went into the services A and B together, then we would subtract the money that we would give to the artists and the money that we would pay to the venue before the start of the concert (in answer #2 above). But, if we are just subtracting the money for the labor performed then we don't do that, since we already know the money before the labor.<n><n>For example:<n>2.50 + 2.00 = $5.00<n>2.25 + 2.00 = 5.25<n><n>

Choices:  A: sophisticated B: imprevist C: arcane D: heavenly E: new<n>Output:		 A<n><n>Input:Dr. Banks had a bank vault in the basement at his office building, located on an island off the coast of New York City. He had built the vault by filling it with sandbags. He also built a special lock on one of the vault doors. He installed an alarm system and a surveillance system. The vault cost $10,000. The cost of getting insurance and employees was $10,000 each. The vault was built to withstand two feet of water.  At 10,634 feet by 19 feet, it was about as large as a football field. The vault was designed to stop robbery even if the robbers had a nuclear bomb. Dr. Banks was a very wealthy guy, so he put his entire fortune into the building. He had hired several construction firms to come in and renovate it for him. These contractors each paid $10,000 to $40,000 for each day they worked for him. The final price was $100,000 for 4,000 men to build the vault. The men only worked on his building in summer during the off-season so the construction would be easier on them.  He also hired a local architect to design the vault. Each day the architect took the measurements for the vault and did the drawings.  These were his drawings and he took the measurements at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. and reported them back to Dr. Banks by text message at the same time every day. Before the vault was built, Dr. Banks spent 6 months doing the building planning. Before he completed it, he sent most of his fortune over to the architect to help pay for the building.  So the final price was $100k for 4, 000 men to build the vault and $250k for the drawings.<n>The final price was $250k for 4, 000 + $6k + $15k = <$250k for 4,000 male construction workers in a summer on a building in New York City>.<n><n>Input: A professor wanted a book about the evolution of the human brain.

How? One son asked his father for his permission to use the moonlight to make their wish come true. He asked for permission one night, then another night, then another. The next day, the father took his son to a telescope and pointed the lens at the moon. "Put your head in there," he said, "and you'll see exactly what we saw when we looked at it the last time." So the boy put his face in the telescope, and he saw the moon. Soon he realized that when his father looked at the moon, the moon looked like him! "But that wasn't your face," his father said, "that was the moon!" Finally, the boy was allowed to look at the moon alone. The moon, he was told, did not even need to know that he was the moon. He just wanted the moon, and in its presence he knew peace and happiness. He decided to keep this vision a secret from his own mother and father, lest they might be offended. They too, however, were pleased, and, after they saw the moon, went back to sleep, content. To celebrate thus far, the mother invited her friends over for cake and punch later that night.<n>Finally, the boy's mother asked him "How was your day?" "Well," replied the boy, "I had a great day, a little weird, but I won't tell you." Her other friends joined in with the same question, and he continued: "Well, my parents wouldn't go to the moon with us, so Mom and I decided to go see it, but we only had 50 dollars to our name, and we both knew that we couldn't buy a ticket by ourselves. Well, Dad bought some tickets, and we went, and Mom got to look at the moon, too, and Mom had such a great time

One man has two bikes on him. With a bike in each hand, he holds the bags up on the front and the bags on the back. He says, "I'll buy some books for you." With each bag he opens, he takes out three magazines of the book. He takes out the first one. The man starts to tell you about the book. When he brings inside the book, he takes out the second and the third magazine. He opens them. He opens the third. He starts to move the magazine he held. You begin to walk off. So, he stops you and says, "Please hold on for a minute." Then he removes the magazine from the front of his front bag and holds it on the back of his bicycle, showing you how to close the bag with ease. "Now, what were you going to say to me?" you ask. "I was going to say 'thank you.'" So you say, "Thank you very much," but he asks why you have to tell him all that. "It wasn't because of your manners," you explain. "I was just giving you a deal. I gave you a magazine for free. But I'm going to buy three magazines for you," he explains. "That's not a deal. If you wanted me to hold it up, I would have done so. If what you just did had taken five minutes to do, I would have asked you to hold the bag instead!" You explain again that what the man did really surprised you. "Then you should have said something," he continues. "I wouldn't have asked you to hold it for me. I would have told you to get off my bike. I wouldn't have asked you why you have to tell me all of this. What you just did seems so rude!" He agrees the situation is strange.<n>You explain to him that this is the way you should have reacted.

That would be around $8-8.75/hour.<n>So the final result would be: An extra 8-8.50 to the top worker + $2 to the union worker = $18.50<n>As far as the cost, the extra $4 is about 1/4 of the total amount. You would need to pay for gas (about) $2, a new car (about) $4, and a new TV (about) $2.75

On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Output: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>So the final answer is 54<n><n>Input:Everybody has a little bit of creativity, but only a few lucky ones get to do what for a living? Choices:  A: sew B: create art C: express yourself D: sing and dance E: write<n>Output:		1. A: Create art2. B: sew3. C: create art4. D: sing and dance5. E: write<n>From each of the listed answers, we know the highest and lowest number of creative jobs in a city:<n>A: 11 (Sydney)<n>B: 0 (Sydney)6. C: 2 (Perth)<n>D: 1 (Sydney)7. E: 1 (Perth)<n>What are the top three states of creativity?<n>A: California, Illinois, and Oregon<n>B: Nevada, Texas, and Florida<n>C: Michigan, Vermont, and New York<n>D: New England, California, and Pennsylvania<n>How do we get to New England, California, Mississippi, and Ohio?<n>Input: Let’s say A and B each have 10 creative workers. Assume that A, B, and C each have 4 artistic workers each. Assume that A sells 10 artistic works per month, and that B sells 1 artistic work a month and C sells 4 artistic works a month.<n>Output: If A and B sell 100.01 artistic works and C sells 100.00 artistic works, then:<n>A sells $100.00 / 4 = $2.03 per artistic work/month =.54<n>B sells $100.00/4 = $1.78 per artistic work/month :.55<n>C sells $100.00 per 4 artistic works/month = $.47 per artistic work/month:.47<n>So we can get from B to C by selling 100 / 4 = $4.13 per artistic work/month to B and $20.61 per artistic works/month to C:<n>From C to D, we have a direct equation that’s only slightly complicated.<n>C sells $12.00 / 4 =.2038 / 4 =.0962<n>So instead of A, D, G, H, J, K, Q, R, S, E, W, Y, Z, we can just add up those 4 + 12 = 25 artistic workers for a total of 50 (out of 1000) workers:<n>$12.00 / 4 equals.00972<n>So we can get 5.5. The total number of artistic workers in the US is 50.<n>From there, we just count up through 10 workers and the total number of artistic workers/month:<n>$12.03 / 10 =.12<n>$

This is true only for the last band of the 5 bands. In the first band, letters "A2" and "A2" are equal in difficulty. In the second and third band, letters "A1" and "A1" are equal. In the fourth band, words can be formed of both "A1" and the last letter in each syllable (e.g., "a-a-a-a, a-as

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n>Output:		 The beaver uses a lot of wood to build structures. The wood he is using is about as heavy as a human at 1.13 kilograms. It uses about as much wood as a human can consume in less than 2 minutes but takes much longer to destroy.  Using a lot of wood means more space for water to flow between the wood and water. This means that there is less room for flooding, less space for flooding, which means there's less time spent on water, and less time spent dealing with water. This results in a higher river depth of 21 inches and flood heights around 25 inches, which is very comparable to the amount of space it takes to build the log.  So the final answer is 21 inches (12.75cm) or 2.5 yards (28cm)<n>(30*1.2=48cm or 1.67 yards)<n><n>Input: A blind man wears reading glasses.

In addition, each person was to take another day and clean it again. For each day, the people were to be paid $100 for their time. If the man chose one of the people to do both the bedroom and the bathroom, the man would receive $200 each day. If the man chose two people each, the man would receive the above sum each day.<n>After each day of cleaning, the man paid for half of it. Each time he put clothes away, he paid for the amount of those clothes that had been left. The man then paid for the amount of the towels that had been used for the day. He also paid for any extra cleaning that had to be done when he went to shower each day. If, after he got all this paid for, the bedroom and the bathroom looked presentable and clean, the man would get $100 each day. If the two bedrooms and the bathroom looked presentably clean for four days, the man would get another $200 each day. However, if the bedrooms did not look presentable for more than that, then the man would have to pay again. Every time the man got new clothes to put away and put the old clothes away properly, he paid for those clothes as well.<n>However, if the bedrooms and the bathroom looked clean for a total of 10 days on each of the previous four cleanings, the man would receive another $200 each day<n>The total amount of $200 times 10 days x 10 days x 10 days = $360 and the man would get to keep all the money that had gone into his bank account on each cleanings.<n>The average time it took the man to get to each bathroom was about an hour. For the other bathrooms, however, the time could be considerably less, especially if at some stage on the next cleaning, the other bathrooms were tidied up.<n>So in total the man had to invest $180 worth of money to get $280 each day.<n>The total investment cost him less than 1% of his total income (if the rooms and the bathrooms had not seen much use from him during that time, he would have spent less).<n>So the final answer (from a purely financial standpoint) is 270.5<n><n>Input:Five hundred thousand dollars are needed to solve a equation.

The elephant stands on seven legs. The elephant stands on nine legs. If a truck is passing overhead, should the front legs be touching the ground and the back legs touching the wall?<n>Input: An elephant with seven legs stands on seven legs. It can travel at a speed of 1.5 mph. The elephant can travel at a speed up to 2.3 mph with only the bottom front leg touching the ground. The elephant can travel through walls at 2.2 miles per hour. The elephant can travel only one mile if it is traveling at a speed less than 5 mph. The elephant can always travel forward without touching the ground by moving directly from its front to back legs. The elephant can only move forward with a speed of 2.3 mph if it is traveling backward. The front legs will always be touching the ground because they are the only legs on the elephant but the back legs are not touching the ground because they must travel at least 1.5 miles before they can touch the ground.<n>Output: The animal stands on exactly seven legs. It must travel at a speed of 0.25 mph to reach a speed of 0.5 mph. It must travel at exactly 2.3 mph to travel through any object. It will travel at a speed of 3.2 mph if it is traveling down a single road in either direction. It will travel at 3.2 plus 3.2 mph to travel through 2 inches of snow. That speed of 3.2 or less is not high enough to make the speed of the elephant. It will be moving sideways if it is traveling on the edge of the road, or forwards if it is traveling on that stretch of road. The average path of the animal is about 4 feet long. The animal only travels down the path in front of it, not behind it. Any way it travels there will always be a straight line.<n><n>Example:<n><n>Input: The dog runs around without a tail.<n>Output: The dog runs very fast without a tail, with or without a tail<n><n>Input: Which number is 1 + 2?<n>Output: 2*1, 2*2, 2*3, 2*4<n><n>Input: There's a firetruck coming down an alley.

This means that our target population for our product will be composed of about 1/4 these new church members. Thus our market is about 1/4 the size. At the same time, we will be selling the same amount of our product to 1/4 the current members of the church. To do this we have to know the population at the current time, the number of new members of which are arriving and the number of departing. We can find this as the sum of the number of new members over the past year. Thus the population in the current year is divided by 100, and the number of new members is divided by the number of members of the church leaving. Since this number is the sum of all the numbers in the population on one year ago, we can work out what proportion they are leaving, and for this we can just subtract 100 from that number. However, we will not do that, so the population in the current and the future years will be:<n><n>Output:<n><n>Input: We are selling 4 cans of tuna steaks.

How long did the bus driver wait to tell his passengers?<n>Output:When the bus driver arrived at his next stop the passengers had already left<n>Since the bus driver had delayed the bus stop, it still took longer than one block<n>Output:The bus driver told all the passengers of the next bus 15 minutes late<n>The bus driver told the remaining passengers of the first bus 15 minutes late<n>So one bus was 10 minutes late and one was 15 minutes late.<n><n>1 Answer<n><n>One must keep in mind that the driver of vehicle is one of a small group of people. A driver doesn't just drive one car, he also drives 3-5 cars...and some of those cars are bigger.<n><n>So each car has a set number of passengers traveling with it. A bus bus for example has a set amount of seats, with the number of passengers increasing or decreasing from time to time. If the amount of passengers on a bus changes, then the number of seats on the bus changed and so did the bus. Thus the driver must keep the number of passenger seats the same.<n><n>But if the driver gets off the bus with no passengers, then the bus is empty. The empty bus has no passengers, but since there

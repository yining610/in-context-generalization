Choices:  A : 1933 b 1943 c 1953 d 1963<n><n>### Response<n>I would rather be traveling in a 1933 time because airplanes weren't around. In the 1940's, 1950, 1960, airplanes were invented, so it would probably be easier to travel in the middle of those three decades.<n><n>### In the following equation, x and y are constants, and you need to select a number for z to solve the equation.<n><n>1/x + 3/y = 4<n><n>### Response  I plugged in the z value for a = -1/2, b=-2/3, c=2/3, and d=1.

She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>### Input:What would you tell ali to do if he bumps into you when you are walking? Choices:  A: work hard B: slow down C: wear shoes D: sell products E: speed up<n><n>### Response:		Choice E<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>This is what I think: what you are looking for us to do is tell you how to describe a function that takes input(in this case, strings) and returns a string. I could probably get it done using 8010 but I'm not sure anyone else would. Let's write a function.<n><n>### Implementation:<n>### How it works:<n>> We have two variables, the first the one that takes an input (in this case, a string) and the second is the output of that string (after it has been manipulated by the function).<n><n>### Example:<n>The input is "What would you tell ali the answer is." The output is "What would you give Ali"<n><n>### Code:<n><n><n>### Solution<n><n>```<n>def tellAli (string){<n>	let count = string.split(" ");<n>	let output = count[0]+' the answer is.';<n>	count[count.length-1]='the answer is';<n>	count[6]= " What would you "<n>	output = count.join(' ');<n>	return output;<n>}<n>```<n><n>### Test<n>Test 1:<n>> `tellAli ('What would you tell ali about')<n>//should give me "What would you tell Ali about the answer is"`<n><n>Test 2:<n>> `tallAli ('What would give ali the answer')`<n>// Should return the message given<n><n><n>### Assessment<n>> Good job, you created a function that takes a string and then changes that string. It is good for you to write code like this since there are many real life circumstances that involve functions like this.<n><n>### Questions:<n>> Could you write a function to do this?<n>yes I could write a function to do it<n><n>### Thank you<n>

She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>### Input:The investigator considered the gun evidence, where did he send it? Choices:  A: drawer B: back to its owner C: police station D: crime scene E: holster<n><n>### Response:		You have to select from each one option that you think applies in the given instruction.<n><n>### Output<n>The investigator sent the gun back to its owner. That's what he decided.<n><n>### Explanation  <n>After using the evidence in the case to determine the gun used was 50/50, 4-4-4-4 for gun used as the victim had a 45, 4-4, 4-4 for gun fired in the victim's mouth.  If the two different guns were 45/50, 55/45, the probability of the gun that was not used would be 50.  Once the investigator sent the gun  back to its owner,  we don't know what to assume for the next  crime.  Thus,  we assume the crime was done by the same  weapon that was found at the crime scene and the investigation is  over.

Choices:  A: persuade B: slept C: take center stage D: challenge E: speak clearly<n><n>### Response:		<n>**The lady did sleep then wake.**<n><n>Greetings, Friends! I am so happy to be here! I love to tell stories, and I'd love to tell you all one today. If I could tell you, that is. Do you understand me? I'm starting to become a bit embarrassed, to be honest. I'm starting to realize that the story may not make much sense, as I haven't practiced telling it a lot. I may not even know how to write a story! I've always felt lost, trying to speak in public, and trying to listen to people try to speak. I feel like I don't have much confidence to do much of anything. I guess maybe I don't know what to do. Doing my tell story is such a task. I have never done a task as huge as this. I need to learn how to do a tell story if I want people to think of me as a person of importance. That's one lesson I learned from my first few days here.<n><n>After thinking it over, I figured that I could try to just... do other things like everyone else. So every night, I'm going to the community chorale here to sing. I'm just not that great at singing. As a matter of fact, my singing could put you to sleep. I used to tell stories about the time I was almost put to sleep. There was once, when I was a little girl, around 5 years old, I was at my grandma's house, and I had a nightmare. It was a really weird dream. I dreamed that there was an angel that was a cat, a talking dog, and a spoon. It's been so long since that night had past. I think the angel probably just wanted to see what I would do with it. I had the spoon, and I used it to fend off the dog before it reached my throat. When I woke up, I was still holding that spoon to my neck. I woke up next to my grandma, and she was giving me a concerned look. My grandma's concerned looks always creep me out, so I got up and went outside. I was outside under her tree, and I saw the most beautiful sunset I have ever seen in my life. It was beautiful. I felt so much better,

Choices:  A: few people B: pay debts C: individual D: single person E: small group<n><n>### Response:		<n>Your input string has 14 characters. First, the index of your string starts at 0. The code that you just wrote is using the substring function. I want you to write a function called reverse(str, start = 0, stop or 0, end), that takes two arguments. The first argument str is the string that we will be reversing. The second argument stop signifies where to end the reversal of your string. It will use the substring of your string, using stop or 0 as your starting index. For our example using the number 5449, you would write reverse("5449", 0, 0, 4) and it would print the string "9454".<n><n>```<n>Input: Mary had two large boxes of 12 pencil sharpeners and 81 pencils in a second box.

Choices:  A: make noise B: band C: museum D: concert hall E: rubber band<n><n>### Response:		<n>How to use the harpsichord :<n>It is one of the oldest instruments known. It was originally used in 1555 when the composer Giovanni Artusi, better known as Giache wrote the first publication to be used with the harpsichord. To use it, one must make sure the hammers are all in the same place before you play your song, then after the song you must replace them. One must also make sure to be seated in a place where all of the people who are in the room will not hear your song. It was first played in private rooms. One would usually choose to listen to it in a quiet place, such as at home. After that, a pianist had changed how the harpsichord worked. <n><n>### Input :What happens when you sneeze: A: you are breathing out air B: you are breathing in air<n><n>### Response :When you sneeze, the muscles at the back of the nose, called the sneeze reflex, contract so that air may easily move through the narrow nasal passages.

She used 5 stickers on the front cover and then 25 stickers to all her pages of her journal. She had 20 stickers remaining.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>She had 70 stick-ers and started her job with 89 stickers, which means that 19 stickers remain. This is because she used 5 stickers for the front cover and 25 stickers for all her pages. 70-19 = 51. 25 ÷ 6 = 4.43. 19-89 = 70 she had 70 at the start of the job.  19-70=51.51 =4.43 and 25 ÷6 = 4.16.<n><n>### A:  train station/ B: cathedral/ C: metro station/ D: fairgrounds/ E: amusement park/<n>A. At the train station<n><n>### Explenation: The amusement park and fairgrounds are both places u can buy tickets for events however the cathedral and the church are not places to purchase tickets.<n>The metro station is also a place you can buy tickets, but it would be more expensive then a larger area like a train station or fairgrounds. The only thing I’ve gotten from this website is that to make an answer you need to break down any answer a student would make and respond to their choice.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>### Input:What would humans do when their legs are tired? Choices:  A: sit down B: make mistakes C: have sex D: reproduce E: excrete<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think the correct option would have been "E: excrete". Their leg would be tired and would produce excrete or do whatever it is that would relieve their legs.<n><n>##### Explanation:<n>As humans we defecate whenever we feel it is required. If it were the case of the legs being tired then defecation is the only option.<n><n>##### Support:<n>We all know how we humans have to do their defecation. We don't have to consider the leg tiredness, it is the only thing that humans can do in that situation. If the options given to us were correct than, this whole problem is solved and we would not be here to talk about the same.<n><n>##### Reason:<n>As humans, we are the ones who are tired; that would explain why we would do whatever it takes to make us feel good. Our urge is so intense that we go for the bathroom as soon as possible. All of these options don't answer that. But defecation does to answer that question.<n><n>##### Example:<n>It must be really painful if our legs are tired and we don't want to do. That is why we defecate to make our legs rest. It would be easier for our bodies to produce the necessary substance that we would have to defecate. That is why the answer would have to be defecation.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>### Input:Always wash your hands before eating, you don't want to get germs onto food and inside your what? Choices:  A: water B: doctor C: spread disease D: mouth E: ear<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input:Always wash hands before eating, don't want germs into the water system, spread disease into the mouth and doctor into the ear so that D is the correct answer.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>> The answer to the first example comes from using the mathematical properties of integers. We add the 3 to the starting number 89 because it is always positive. The number of stickers used to the other pages is the sum of the size of each page in stickers (7 per), which is always negative. The answer is 44, the sum of the starting and used numbers. Here is my code:<n><n>~~~JavaScript<n>var a = 89;<n><n>var sumx, summ1, sum2, sum3;<n><n>summ1 = a + 3;<n><n>for (var i = 1; i < a ; i++){<n>    summ1 = a + i;<n>}<n><n>summ2 = a - i;<n>for (var k = 0; k< i; k++){<n>    summ2 = a + k;<n>}<n><n>for (var j = 0; j< 3; j){<n>    sum2 = a;<n>}<n><n>var sum3 = a + 7;<n>for (var m = 0; m < a; m++){<n>    sum3 = a + m;<n>}<n>~~~<n><n>>The second example should be answered using common human knowledge. My answer should be correct, unless it is unreasonable, like someone eating a sandwich with his/her ears.<n><n>~~~JavaScript     <n><n>var i=1;<n>var j=0;<n>var k = 89/7;<n><n>var question = "A";<n><n>if(question == "A"){<n>    <n>} else if(question == "B"){<n>    water=i+1;<n>}<n>~~<n><n>> Input: "A: water B: doctor   C: spread disease D.: Mouth   E: ear  " Output: "A" <n><n>> The third example is a multiple choice question.<n>><n>> <n>- 1: Input: "Always wash your hand before eating, don’t want germs into water system, spread disease inside mouth and doctor into ear so that D is correct answer."<n>-

Neural networks are an implementation of computational models that are inspired by the working of the animal brain. A neural network learns when given proper unlabeled training data and correct labels for the training examples. A common use of neural networks is pattern recognition e.g., in speech recognition applications neural networks classify the sounds into phonemes."<n><n><n>###  Input:<n>Write a program that prints output that answers the following questions:<n>Input: Do you want fries with that?<n>Answer: McDonald's sells french fries<n><n>###  Solution:<n>Input: Do You Want Fries With That?<n>Answer:  McDonald's seller french fries<n> <n>---<n>Neural Network Basics<n>---<n><n>## Overview: What is a Neural Network?<n><n>- Computational models that are inspired by how the human brain works.  <n><n>## Components and Concepts<n><n>### Software<n>1.

Choices:  A: shake hands B: control events C: talk to each other D: think creatively E: dress themselves<n><n>### Response:		<n>The first step when trying to brainstorm is to find a meeting place or area. After the area is found, one person should think of a topic the group can brainstorm about. In the second portion of the step, the second person writes down the topic.  The third step is to write down as many ideas within the allocated time as possible about the topic. If a new idea is formed, it should be written down too. The final step is to share the list with the group. This is done by having the last person write down an idea on a piece of paper, fold the paper, place it in a bowl. Once this is complete, the next person draws a paper from the bowl and takes a turn.  Continue until each member of the group shares an idea.<n><n>### Output:<n><n>### Reasoning:<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>### Other Information<n><n><n><n><n>The solution does not have to be the solution I chose or how I chose<n>to do it.

The rule "majoritarianism" often refers to the decisions made by a majority in contrast to the minority. The term "majoritarian" is often used by economists, political scientists, politicians, public intellectuals, and others who favour majority rule. Democracy in its most broad sense includes both liberal republics which have elected governments and the concept of direct democracy where people decide on issues for themselves. In a "majoritarian" form of government, democracy is a system which is governed on the basis that the wishes of the majority are always supreme. In modern societies, majoritarianism is sometimes described as a "will of the people", with this term emphasising that decisions and actions are the exclusive authority of the majority who, if they chose, might choose to make decisions which would not be democratic or egalitarian. In this sense, "majoritarian" government is a type of democracy which is both authoritarian and one-sided.<n><n>### Input<n><n>- The man was condemned to ______?<n><n>- 7 B<n><n>### Democratically elected dictatorships:<n><n>- 8 9 10<n><n>### Answer<n><n>CORRECT!<n>"In a "majoritarianism", democracy is a system where the wishes of the majority always supreme." Democracy is "a system where people decide things for themselves" and "a way of making laws". (These all seem to support "democracy", don't they?) _O_ democracy supports "majoritarianism". _O_ democracy is about "majoritarianism": that's the point, isn't it? _O_ democracy refers to a "form" of government. _X_ democracy is one-sided. _X_ democratic systems can be authoritarian. _O_ democracies tend to be one-sided ("majoritarian"). _X_ democracies are not always one-sided, are always democratic, and sometimes authoritarian. This is the most common mistake I've seen with the 8 question. Whenever possible, I'd rather see the word'majoritarian

Wet grass and dew from the overnight rain has yet to evaporate and a light layer sits on the path, making it a bit difficult to walk on. The trail is narrow and littered with many rocks and roots that make it a bit difficult to navigate the forest floor, but that is about to change. You notice that the sun is high above you, but if you walked a little further to the South East, you would be in the shadows and it would be more comfortable. At this moment, 44 feet South of you lies a small clearing, but to get to the clearing you must navigate your way through a small path, which is surrounded by dense foliage and rocks.<n><n>Your first thought is to go North, but that doesn't work very well because you will just run into even more dense vegetation and rocks. There is no way anyone can climb, crawl under, or walk around these rocks. Even if you were to dig, you will simply end up with an empty hole. There was just so much vegetation and obstacles to deal with. After a short amount of time, you begin to move closer the clearing. One of the things that you noticed is that there was an old apple tree near the clearing, and the fruit that was still on the tree looked ripe. Even the bark from the tree looked like the tree was in excellent condition. That said, as much as you would like to pick an apple and go into the clearing, there was no way you could reach the apples when standing at the tree. After thinking about the situation for a minute, you notice that the roots of the tree are extremely thin, as if they only covered a small distance from the base of the tree to the top. If you were to place something on the side of the tree that held a lot of weight, the force of the weight would pull the tree over and you would have complete access to the apples. Unfortunately, you did not have anything on you that would hold such a large amount of weight. You were about to leave the clearing, when you finally noticed something odd about one of the apples. Upon further inspection, you

I’d choose to make the statement “Stretching exercises such as yoga release endorphins which are the body’s natural opiates and can provide feelings of calmness similar to those caused by drugs like oxycontin.” I would also recommend you make edits to capitalization and grammar as it seems there is the word “expend” where it should be “extend”.<n>### Instruction 2: Answer the following multiple choice question, all of which relate to your job.<n>### Demononstration 2: Input:  You have 3 clients who signed up for your website and are waiting for the first newsletter to be sent to them.<n><n>### ANSWER:<n>B: There are no client accounts active.<n><n>### You have 3 clients, Mary who signed up a month ago and is already active, Anne who signed up during the past week and is not active, and Joe who signed up during the week, and is active.<n>### Response: Answers are A and D.

Choices:  A: street B: binder C: obesity D: living room E: office suite<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>##### A. Street<n>Stickers can be seen on the street, but you might be looking for something more generic. The question asked for one that _most_ people have, so it's probably best to choose a divider that is something more general.<n>##### B. Binder<n>These are some of the best tools for keeping order among many different papers. You might ask if there is room to put in more stickers, though, because it's asking for a general, not necessarily the largest. This is the best response.<n>##### C. Obesity<n>These, unfortunately, do not fit into a binder. If you have to have a divider than an obese person might use multiple of them, but not a single one.<n>##### D. Living room<n>The living room holds just about everything that doesn't really have a 'home' yet. It isn't really appropriate for most homework, though, and would be too big.<n>##### E. Office suite<n>All of those are pretty big. If you are looking for a general divider, you don't really want to take every option off the table, especially if you pick a specific one.<n><n>##### B.

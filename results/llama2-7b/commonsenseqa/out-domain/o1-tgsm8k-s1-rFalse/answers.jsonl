Let the first number of stickers in each book be x, let it be positive and \u03a3x = 104\n\n  2. Given the question and since the second book has 7 stickers in each book and the first book has 3 stickers, we know that the number of stickers in the first book is 3*104/7 = 43.14285714.\n\n  3. We don't need to take the 3 and multiply with 14.\n\n2. Second, we determine the number for each book to use 3 and multiply it to the same denominator\n\n  4. Since the second book has 3, we determine the number that it will take the number of stickers and we multiply it to 104.\n\n  5.

Let me tell you. Python cannot understand what you want. That is, unless you put it in words. It cannot understand that you put numbers in it. What it requires is just plain old words. That, my friend, is what Python expects.\n\nEnsure all your variables have a name. That's super important. In python, all variables have a name. The name of the variable is not necessary for it to operate, but it is important to keep it in your mind so no conflicts happen, especially if there's more than one variable that exists already. For the variables, they need to be in the following syntax: VariableName=InputOrVariable\n\nMy code:\n\nfor line of input:\n    sticker, remainer= [inputs that are separated by commas]\n       if sticker=3:\n                print (\"E\")\n\n       if sticker==7:\n                print (\"R\")\n}\n\nIt's in the first example above.\n\nIn your second example, try input:\n\nName=input(\"Where are the books?\"\nType what you want the books to go to when typing into python, it will probably be a lowercase letter. The letters need to be in A to E for Python to figure out where it is", "answer": "A: shelf"}

The payroll said that his salary is 4 times the employee's regular working hours times his pay rate. The new hires work 6 hours a day at the rate of $15 and hour.  The payroll calculated the new hires' salary as $215, and the new hire got 2.05 hours of extra break time. Was the new hire overpaid or underpaid by $215? Choices: A The new hire is overpaid by $200. The new hire is underpaid by $15. The new hire will be paid $215 on his first paycheck. The new hire was overpaid by $0 and paid $14 on his first paycheck, which caused a minor upset. B The new hire is given 2.05 working hours breaktime, and is underpaid by 15, meaning he'll be due a $55 refund The new hire is paid by $215 on first paycheck, 1.7 hours of overtime, and $10 for being late to work once. B is closest to the problem. The new hire should get 2.05 - 14 in extra salary.\nOutput: A: There is a problem with their calculations because the 200 minutes of breaktime will be deducted from the 315 minutes of worktime.

I initially started writing with the recursive method because I thought that my steps could be handled within one line of recursive code or even a loop, but eventually decided it was simpler to split my steps into a different method with a for loop for each step. \n\n### Instructions:Answer the multiple choice questions and explain your answer. \n\n1. What is the difference between a method and a function?\n\nA function is a block of code that can be called with the use of the function keyword to do a certain action, whereas a method is defined with the use of the class keyword inside a class.\n\n2. What is the difference  between an anonymous method and a method in a method?\n\nAnonymous methods are defined through a lambda expression, and a method in a class is defined by using the class keyword, newLine() and the method name in parentheses with the period after the last line in the parentheses signifying the end of the method definition.\n\n3. Why would you want to define a method inside your class instead of outside?\n\nDefining a method inside a class is better for organization because it allows the method to access protected or private methods of other classes, whereas defining methods outside of classes gives you less options and puts your method at a disadvantage.\n\n4. You are creating a method, what would you put in the constructor  call in order to pass the method parameter?\n\nThe constructor call can be a specific type of the class that is going to be passed into the parameter of the method that is defined inside the class. For example, if I wanted to use my method to calculate the sum of an array of integers, I could create my method and call it in a line like this: int sum = 0;\n    sum = myMethod1(\"The  Int []  argument\");\n\n5. What is a return statement?\n\nThe return statement can be used to tell the program to ignore whatever is inside of curly brackets like this { and ignore whatever is inside of this} so that it can keep performing the actions that you wish for it to. After a return", "answer": "C: castle"}

{"text": "A\n\nYou could also answer this with just two lines of code, instead of 3. You should still write it here.\n\nYour name and your professor's name\n---\n\n### Problem 3\n\nWrite a program that contains 10 distinct expressions that contain only two values - less than and greater than - and the operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `==`, `>=`. These 10 values should be taken from `1`, `0`, and `\"\".`\n\n### Hints: (Hints will show when you hover over the question!)\n\n1.  **Hint 1:**\n\n  - The answer is a list of Python strings. You can refer to these strings as objects or dictionaries.\n\n2.  **Hint 2:**\n\n  The `set` built-in function does exactly what you want but it is more complicated to use properly. The `set` data type is different from `list` and `dict` data types. `set` will not duplicate the values in the list. If you just use `dict` instead of `list`, your code will work though you could be using the wrong language construct.\n\n  Also the `any` or the `all` operator would have worked. But again this is a problem about writing a list of strings.\n\n3.  **Hint 3:**\n\n  You can just loop over your list and check each string you put into the list to make sure that all the strings you are going are the strings in your dictionary. If the string in the dictionary is in your list so all the strings must be in your list. If any of the strings are not in your dictionary you know you made an error in your code.\n\n4.  **Hint 4:**\n\n  If the first part of your code works correctly you are nearly done. You can get by with a dictionary comprehension (or a list comprehension) to make it more succinct.", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

Then the loop runs over the first 20 integers and then runs conditionally over the 20 values other than the first value.\nIn the fib function, you should see a \"pass\" which simply calls itself in the same position with the same arguments.\nThis is called recursion, and it is a really powerful way to reduce your program, even to the point that it becomes unreadable. This is the power of computers. \n\n### Insturctions:If the integer is even, put a \"A\"\n\nInput:  A: 1 B 11\nOutput: A\n\n```\n\n## Functions: \nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html", "answer": "D: knowingly"}

What is the point of this program?\n    - to demonstrate that if we use multiple inheritance we will have to do it correctly, with multiple class names in the parent class in which we want to inherit from\n    - to see how to implement multiple inheritance correctly in a class hierarchy with a base class, two other classes, and a method that will use both of them correctly\n\n2. What problems might this solution encounter? (Why can\u2019t we do this?)\n    - Errors while calling the method:\n        -  when using `Solution#1` (multiple inheritance)\n            `parent.foo(\"hello\", bar_name, 3, 4);`\n            `foo(\"hello2\", 3);`\n            `bar_method()`\n        -  when not using `Solution#2` (single inheritance)\n            `foo(\"ello\", 3);`\n    - Can we use the same object as the parent and child?\n        -  Yes, but it doesn't make sense to use it both ways. This is a special feature of programming languages and is useful in some cases, for example, to define a\n          constructor, but mostly only in such extreme cases that a programming language allows it. In normal practice it is advisable to define new classes.\n\n3. Was this code written correctly according to the material in these lectures? Why or why not?\n    - Yes it was according to material in lecture.\n    - If we use multiple inheritance we have to write multiple class names in the object parent and then we can overwrite individual fields and methods according to their\n      respective functionality. But we also have to make sure that when we call certain methods, we are calling the correct one.\n\n4. What errors can multiple inheritance methods cause in a base class-child class hierarchy? (List 2 or 3 potential errors and explain them.)\n    - when invoking methods in the child class, the base class method is called that doesn\u2019t apply to the object (error:  calling wrong method)\n    - When the object is a parent and a child at the same time, the children method will never work. Methods in the parent class should never be called in the child class.\n    - Can\u2019t inherit from 3 classes to create 3 separate children from 1 parent class.", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

For this exercise, we will create a new file called Exercise4.cs and create a new C# program within that file named Exercise4. \n\nFor the first question, we will want to use variables, a concept we are not overly familiar with. As a result, we should create a variable named \nMaryStickers that, when declared, will hold the value Mary has remaining of stickers. We can store this value as an integer by declaring MaryStickers as an integer instead of a string. Here is a sample initialization statement for the variable MaryStickers that initializes it with a value of 89:\n\n```csharp\nint MaryStickers = 89;\n```\n\nNow, since the question asks for how many stickers remain, we need to think about this question from a mathematical perspective. Mary is said to have 89 stickers at the inception of the problem. From this, we know that Mary's journal has 91 pages (1 page to hold the cover, and 1 page to store the 89 stickers). Thus, once we account for 10 stickers for the cover and 89 stickers to be used, there remain 8 stickers on Mary's journal. However, we have already stored 3 large stickers and 7 smaller stickers used to decorate 6 of the journal's pages. As such, Mary's journal has a grand total of 44 stickers left (using the total so far in counting the cover and pages). As a result, we only need to print a value of 44 to satisfy the assignment.\n\n```csharp \nint MaryStickets = 89; \nwhile (MaryStickets > 0) \n{\n    if (MaryStickers % 10 == 0)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"The cover page uses {9 + MaryStickers / 10", "answer": "A: pass water"}

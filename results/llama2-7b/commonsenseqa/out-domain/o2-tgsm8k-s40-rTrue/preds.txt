The bottom of the box is 5 feet from the trunk of the tree. In addition to the toy box, there are 100 more toy boxes lined up on the grass, all spaced equally a distance from the tree. A family member sets out a trail of toy boxes from the toy box under the tree, each toy box being 4 feet away from the next box. The youngest child is happy to follow this trail of toy boxes as he gathers toys that have been dropped by the eldest child as they play.<n>Output: Let's determine the distance the youngest child is away from the box under the tree. There are one hundred boxes that are four feet apart for a total distance of 400 feet. Since the youngest child is going to be following the trail of toy boxes for the rest of the day, let's determine the total distance as to how long it would take for them to finish. Let's say the trail ends 100 feet later at 500 feet. (400 + 500 = 900) So the youngest child would have to walk 3/4 mile to get to the box that the eldest placed at the beginning of the trail.

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Output: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>So the final answer is 36<n><n>Input:Where would you be able to hear a bassoon played in an unpleasing fashion? Choices:  A: orchestra B: baritone woodwind sound C: symphony D: play music E: high school band<n>Output:		A: Orchestras can be found playing the bassoon in various settings, including symphonies and symphonic works, ballet music, baroque pieces, and in military and ceremonial music.<n>The bassoon is not an unpleasing instrument in its own right. It’s more common to hear it played in an unpleasant manner, like in amateur ensembles.<n>The baritone woodwind sounds are similar to the sound of the bassoon, but they don’t have the same pitch range. Instead of a range that goes up to C-sharp5, a baritone woodwind will have a range that goes up only as far as B-flat5.<n>The symphony is a genre of music that uses a lot of brass and string instruments.<n>Because of how they are produced, and in common use, high school bands often produce a sound that is quite unpleasant. So it’s not uncommon to hear it played in both amateur ensembles and school bands.<n>The bassoon sounds unpleasant because the musician is intentionally doing so to play the instrument in a comedic fashion. If this is truly a new thing for you, you may want to try to play a different instrument.<n>The bassoon can also be heard in military, ceremonial, school, and amateur music.<n>The basses can be used in a great many music programs and settings. However, the more professional and musical ensembles don’t use them. They are often found in amateur orchestras and military and ceremonial settings. They are also used in film scores. So, they aren’t particularly “pleasing” to the ear.<n>There are many kinds of bassoon music, including classical and jazz, and both can sound great depending on what you enjoy. However, it is usually best to use the instrument in a professional setting, if you want the sound to be pleasing to the ear.<n>The bassoon’s sound is unpleasant because the person who plays it is playing it in a comedic fashion for the sake of comedy. You may want to listen to the bassoon in a more professional setting (like an orchestra) instead.<n>You can hear a bassoon played out in an unpleasing way in a movie or television show. You could also go to a concert hall and watch some of the movies that have their own orchestral sections, like

They could go to a restaurant, but they might be too busy during the day or have other things to do. Other people might want to eat in a restaurant in the evening instead. Another option is to make a loaf of bread for dinner instead. People who work at a restaurant might also make bread and sell it at lunchtime if there are no customers and they have time.<n>Food can be purchased at a restaurant or a store. You could make food for lunch or dinner depending on which is the case. Some people want to be able to eat it because they aren't able to eat at the restaurant they go to in the evening or a restaurant they go to in another town. If they can make a loaf of flour, then they will be able to create bread and eat it quickly. If you make a loaf of meal, you will have food for dinner time. If someone has to make meal for a restaurant or a store, then they will be busy making a lot of food at the same time. In this case, making meal is a good idea.<n><n>Answer:

Choices:  A: overhead compartment B: chair C: hospital D: in shirt E: business meeting<n>Output:		Choice: (D): business meeting<n>Explain: <n>Business meetings take place in offices, which implies that they do not take place at airports nor are they associated with hospitals. The only choices that remain are in-shirt, overhead compartment, chairs and hospitals. Attache cases are portable cases that are meant to carry documents. It doesn't make any sense for it to be in shirt because documents are not meant to be contained in an object in your shirt. It would also look weird, so it cannot be in your shirt.<n><n>We are left with the options of in-shirt, chairs, overhead compartments and hospitals. <n><n>In-shirt means that you're holding the case in your shirt. Although this could be a good guess, I doubt that it would be the answer because it doesn't make sense to have an attache case inside of your shirt. If it is necessary to go with this option, it's better to choose this option in order to get the question right.<n><n>We are ultimately left with the choices of the overheard compartment, the chair and the hospital room.<n><n>-Overhead compartments are meant for items that should be in a plane. They are not meant for clothes and documents. The attache case can't be contained in the overhead compartment because it does not pertain to a plane, therefore, the attache case will not be in the overhead compartment.<n>-Chairs are not meant for transportation purposes. I assume that the attache case is an item that should be contained in the overhead or a place meant for transportation purposes, therefore, it cannot be in a chair.<n><n>-Finally, the attache case would not be in the hospital room or the chair because that is against medical ethics. It also doesn't make sense that people go to hospitals to meet and it wouldn't make sense to sit in an attache case. Therefore, the attache case is contained in the business meeting.

No other colors are present. How many balls of each color do you expect to find on the top two balls removed from the box?<n>Output: The answer to this problem is C, three blue balls on the first ball and four on the second. You can start by just picking two random balls from the box.

Each cocoa bean has a certain percentage (by mass) of white substance.  The cocoa beans contain 19% white substance. The cocoa beans are processed and the white substance is removed from each bean. The total weight of white substance removed from all the cocoa beans is 1.6 kilograms. How much more cocoa powder was produced from the white substance than was produced from the pure cocoa beans?<n>Output: White substance (by volume) contains a certain percentage by volume of cocoa powder.  So, by Volume, the white substance is 81% cocoa beans and 19% white powder.<n>The weight of white substance is 1.6 kg so, by mass it is 1600kg and by volume it is 81% = 1.3. So let's call it 1.4kg.<n>1.6kg has 19% of pure cocoa beans by volume (81% * 19% = 15.8%). So there would be 81% of this, or 13%.<n>The percentage of cocoa beans remaining is 86% remaining so multiply by volume to get the amount of mass left 86% * 1.3kg/81% * 81% = <<1.3kg/ <<86% * 81, 19% > 81% * 6% > 81, 9% cocoa beans<n>Therefore the final answer is more by volume.<n>Input: Six dogs will be at the dog park on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Where would he look? Choices:  A: fish market B: hawaiian waters C: gulf of mexico D: tropical sea E: south pacific ocean<n>Output:		The fish market (B) was the busiest,  as it had 322 fish. Next, the tropical sea (D) had 200 fish. The hawaiian waters (B), as one of the top three, had 162 fish. Gulf of mexico (D)  had 88 fish. E) (C) had 26 fish, as it is a tropical sea, and in the top three. The water was 82 degrees and there were coral reefs, as well as other wildlife. The sea was full of cute puppy fish, which were 90 degrees,  and were very active. Gulf of mexiuc (D) had 80 fish. The south pacific ocean (E) had 67 fish in it.<n>The difference between (A) and (D) would be 199, as (B) and (C)  had 250 and 330 fish respectably. (E) was in the top three with 26 fish, so the number of fish in the tropical sea would be larger, (D) would be larger than (B), and (D) would most likely be larger than (E).  If (D) had 162,  (A) had 322, (B) had 82, (C) had 330, (E) had 26, and (F) had 80, then (F) could not be as large as (E,C) or (D), nor as large as (D). (B) and (E) were the two options that were the largest by comparison. (B) was 22 points greater than (E), and (B) was also 24 points greater than (F). The option with the smallest number of fish in the sea (out of the five) was (F), which was also 8 points smaller than (D). (E) had 18 points less than (A), and only 6 points less than (B), though 6 is half of 12, which is 12 points. (F) had 1 point more than (C), and (B) also had 1 point more. (A) was 46 points more than (E), and was also 43 points more than (

Choices: A: Yes B: No<n>Output: We can assume that there was a mistake in the census which was taken to create the list of Titanic passengers. When the ship sank, each cabin was emptied and given away to surviving passengers. A large number of women didn't board the lifeboats and instead went into one of the lifeboats by themselves. Once some men found themselves in the women only-cabins they would have taken one of these lifeboats.<n><n>Since two lifeboats are 24 people, this would mean that there were 24 women on the lifeboats. If all men had boarded lifeboats with women who did not survive, why would there be 24 women but only 12 men on the lifeboat? The only explanations could be: <<only 12 men on lifeboats>><n><n># Women are more afraid to be rescued than men and are therefore more likely to hide themselves in small areas<n># Men are more desperate for survival and so more likely to leave women than the reverse is true<n><n>Aside from survival instincts, the only other explanation is that men were not all in the lifeboats, leaving women on the lifebeats, but when men came by, they left and when men were rescued, they assumed that all the women were aboard the lifeboats which was not the case. Then, once rescued, each cabin was emtpy so only men were in the lifeboat, so on that trip, the lifebo

Choices:  A: rain forest B: tree tops C: toy store D: zoological gardens E: great outdoors<n>Output:		A<n>In the zoo, the monkey is a captive animal. So the captive monkeys live in a zoo. Therefore, the correct answer is the zoo.<n><n>Answer(10): 29<n>Answer(20): 67<n>Answer(30): 103<n>Answer(50): 137<n>Answer(100000): 1123<n><n>1.	For the first part, I came up with the general idea. However, I think that I should've paid more attention to the instructions of the question. We were asked to solve the problem for the output number 67, so I put the 29 for that part. I was going to put 29 for the second part but I didn't notice a change in the question type. If I had used the instructions better, I would've noticed that the question type was changed and got a better score on that part.<n><n>2.	I struggled a lot more on the third part. I was a little confused on what to do and tried all sorts of different things that I thought could work. If I had studied more for this section or remembered that the answer was from a previous section, I think I could've gotten a higher score. In retrospect, I didn't look at the previous sections enough to see if my questions have been answered or not so the same struggles were repeated on the fourth part.<n><n>3.	I struggled on the fourth part because of the same thing as with part three. I didn't notice that my score kept on going down and I just thought that this part was getting harder, so I spent a lot more time than I needed to on some of the answers. If I had noticed that I was losing points, I would've been able to complete parts four and five quicker and could've gotten higher scores.<n><n>4.	I knew the process of using the instructions. Since I took the GRE previously, I knew a lot about their format so that wasn't the issue. The thing that I struggled with was remembering to apply that process to all sections. Since my score kept on going up after part one, I didn't really worry about using the instructions in other parts. If I had tried to use the instructions in other parts, I think I could have scored much higher.<n><n>5.

You have already eaten 19 pieces. You have given away 22 pieces to other people. How many cookied are left?<n>Output: To help answer this question I looked at this question as a equation and wrote out all the variables. I made a equation: 85 - 19 = <<$85-19=66>>66 chocolate chip cookies - 22 = <<$66-22=44>>44. Since 44 is smaller than 85 I wrote an equation with only the small 44. 66- 44 = <<$66\-44=22>>22 I combined both 44 and 22 into 44-22= <<$66+22=44\-66+22>>44(minus)22(plus).  It is now time to solve for the value of 44, to do so I made the equation 66+22 = 44(minus) 22. When you do this it gives you 66+2= 64 which is the solution<n>The final answer is 22<n><n>Input: A truck can carry 4000 books at a time. A train can carry 800 boxes at a time. A plane can carry up to 400 passengers. How many people would have to board a train to transport as many people as one truck and one plane could transport?<n>Output:  I first found the combined number of boxes that a truck and plane can transport by multiplying 4000 by 400. This equals 1,600,000. Then I find the combined amount of books that a train and plane can transport by simply multiplying 800 by 1600000. This gives you the answer 128,000,00. Since we can have more people on a train than on a plane, this is how I would divide this number in half, so the answer is 64,000, and the final answer is 64000<n><n>Input: What is twice 15 plus three times -

They are asking for numbers that are either 3 or 4, 7 or 8, 10, and so on.<n><n>Question 2:<n>Did you figure correctly?<n>Yes, I figured these out correctly. The one that bothered me most because I did not understand the question was "How many letters are in the most 5 digit numbers?" If you read the question out loud, "How many letters are ___ most_ 5 digit numbers?" it seems like it should be one letter to the power of 20, but in the end I realized it should be 20 because of wording and that the word "most" is used in relation to a single number being more than the rest.<n><n>Question 3:<n>What are the other answers?<n>They give all answers but I cannot say 10, 12, or 14 are in the least number of digits without any prompts or other hints. I'm not sure how to find these

He was frightened.  He didn't want this.  He was scared of what? Choices:  A: death B: coma C: peace D: forgetfulness E: loss of life<n>Output:		He felt himself losing consciousness, and he wasn't afraid of what?<n>He wasn't afraid of becoming a vegetable ( coma),  nor was he afraid of dying ( death), he didn't want to forget things( forgetfulness),  so all of those are bad outcomes.  Then what was he afraid of?<n>I thought about it for a while,  and I came up with being in a state where  life but consciousness was not, like being dead..<n>The choices given, though, is A: death B:coma C:peace D:forgetfulness E:loss of life<n>So I had to look those up.  Loss of life was being in a coma.  Coma is also a loss of consciousness (I'd like to think it means "falling into a coma" though)  He was clearly afraid of coma being too close to death and being in a coma, that's how he felt himself "losing consciousness".<n>Then I remembered that being a vegetable is being in a coma!  So that choice was death!  Now there was only one option left..<n>Peace.  Hmmm, I knew that one wasn't it.  Peace is a state, and being in a com or vegetative state is a state.  It seemed he knew about what a coma was, so that couldn't be it.  What else could he fear?  I didn't really have any ideas.<n>What he is afraid of is losing life,  so the correct answer is E ( loss of life)

Rugged Off-road tires are built with studded lugs, so they have 360 studs on each tire. The other two types of tires have studs spaced evenly on the tires, so there are 180 studs each. The 180 stud tires are the best selling tire. The managers are contemplating selling the 360 stud tires as well, but they have cost doubts. The tires are very expensive to produce and they don't sell well. To get an idea of what they can charge, they know that the two 180 studd tires together cost $1,200 to make. The same type of two tires made without the studs cost $900 to make. Can the tires with 360 stud cost at least $900?<n>Output: Yes, the 360-stud tires costs more than $900: 1,200 ÷ 360 > 900 ÷ 2.<n><n>Input: Two trains are leaving at 1:03pm and 1:29pm, each traveling at the same speed, and headed in the same direction from two train stations that are at least 30 miles apart.

The man gets 25 chips, and 3 $55 hamburgers.<n>I know this solution is correct because there was a similar problem I had from a different book and this is identical to that answer.<n><n>Input: Three friends are considering a walk that each must pay a third of its cost, a walk that each must go one half its cost, and a walk that each must take at least half its cost. They agree that the cost of the first trip will be $1475, but they must raise the remaining.1 of the cost.  If the three friends deposit $146, how much will it cost them to go on the tour?<n>Output: The answer is 32. $146 will make 320 in 475, so 725 will be given to total cost. 320 goes into 475 5 times, meaning 7 people will be able to total 475.  For the first choice to fit, each person needs to pay 725/$475 = <<725/475= 1.53>>1.53 or $600.2/3 is 666.7 or about $333, the remaining will be needed to cover the $146.3/3= <<33/3===1.1>>1.1 or $116.9<n>The final answer is 320+116.9=

A group of citizens of the kingdom met and created a protest movement stating that the king did not have the right to kill a citizen. The king was angered because this protest was against the kings decision. He ordered to have all the protesters executed. The group included 23 boys and 13 girls. They realized that they were too much of a threat and decided to divide up into two groups. A larger group consisted of 54 members including all of the boys and a smaller group including only 9 girls. The larger group was more dangerous for the king because it included all of the boys. They knew that each boy could be easily killed with a sword. If the large group was killed, the king would still be in danger since the smaller group would not be as easily killed. They decided to divide their numbers evenly between the boys and the girls. The king feared the boy’s group and so he executed those 54 members. This meant that he was in more danger than he was before he ordered to kill those members of the group. The small group of girls remained.  What was the original size of the boy’s group<n>Output: 54<n><n>Input: Dr Jones was trying to find the value of 3/4. She multiplied 3/4 and got 0.75 and she multiplied 0.75 * 0.75 but got a smaller number and not the answer. She multiplied 0.125 (0.75^2) and got 0.0125. This proved to her that she needed to raise 3/4 to the 2nd power (0.75) to get the right answer so she multiplied 3 x 3/4 x 3/4 and still got a lower value. If she had raised it to the 3rd power (0.5625) she would've easily known it to be 21.875.

So instead they went back to work.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>I think the answer is c, because they had to go back to work, and I think it means they had to go "back" to eat. "Back" means go forward in a different direction than you usually go. To eat at home they had to go back home instead of going forward in a different direction.<n>### Explanantion:<n>The question and response were just made up. It is not a real question.

It is also not a collective exhaustive of all the possibilities.<n><n>This option is false because if you live in a stadium you will definitely be with many other people living there, or it will be in a very small town where you wouldn't be considered living in a "surface of earth".<n><n>This option is also false because you could live on the surface of the Earth, but still live in a stadium with large families.<n><n>The answer in B is not collectively exhaustive, so the answer B is false.<n><n>Answer C: This option is false because there is a high chance of people living in the surface of the Earth because their options are: "football stadium", "apartment" and "surface of earth"<n><n>Answer D: This is true. The question says "you". This means singular, so there are no other options. The answer should be true.<n><n>Answer E: This is false because the question is "Where do almost all people" live. This means there are a lot of people, so they cannot stay in one house throughout their entire lives. They could at least stay there for a year. The answer is false.<n><n>All of the answers in which B and C were included were false. The answer that it is in a carshow is true so the final answer is true.<n><n>The answer should be carshow.<n><n>

He has a lot of what? Choices:  A: laughter B: being happy C: glee D: opera E: injuries<n>Output:		The correct answer is: A – being happy. Happy is an informal word that means similar to “joyful, glad, or content.” When something brings you joy, you are happy. We use it to talk about your emotions or your situation at the moment. We use it to describe general moments of well-being as well as being surprised by something good that happens. <n>For instance, you might say, “She was happy when she bought her first house.” (She was very glad.) You could also say, “We were happy at the surprise party!” (We were astonished and happy to see our friends.) Or, “He was happy to win another gold medal at the Olympics.” (He was pleased to win another gold medal.)<n><n>If you’re looking to use it to describe an action, we do it the exact same way. "Tom was happy to dance with his wife." (Tom was happy to dance.) We use a specific form to talk about our action, like when we were happily singing and dancing at an event. We use it to say that you were happy, in its fullest sense, in the process of singing, like when you danced to your favorite song in front of the mirror. When we use it to say that we did something, usually something positive, we also use the form with the present participle, like Danny was happily singing in front of his<n>      class. If you want to talk about something that is continuing happening, you have to use a different form, as we have discussed above. <n><n><n>If you were to ask, “how many of you are happy?” you would hear, “We were happy when you brought your favorite ice cream flavor!” (We enjoyed eating ice cream.) <n>When we ask questions, we use it in the contracted form, as in “Are you happy today?” (Are you happy?)<n><n>We do not use it in the progressive form very much. When we do, it always means being contented. We wouldn’t say “I am happily driving in traffic.” (I am driving in traffic) but rather, “I am happily content behind the wheel.”<n>We also don’ input:Danny was having a lot of A.B.C.D.E. laughter.<n>His class was having fun and they enjoyed Danny’s singing. <n>Danny had fun singing.

She is also 24 pounds lighter than her son, who weighs 15 pounds more than her father and 37 pounds less than her other sibling.

So, this does not qualify.<n>Then we have underwater, while underwater is a natural place for fish, it most likely would not be the main part of where the average fish hangs out for most of the time, as it is certainly harder to be around in a lot of areas, as to be down there is an entire adventure in itself.<n><n>Since we have established the facts that the body of water, and the underwater are natural spots for fish, we must narrow the area of interest to be a single area, and that area is the aquarium, the toilet is out of the question due its lack of similarity to a natural environment, the body of water is also out of the question for the same reasons as the toilet, as well as the fact that the natural environment of a fish is not a lake, the underwater is still far too adventuresome for a fish, so we are left with the aquarium as the only logical choice for the question.<n><n><n>Input: A panda walks 3km due west, 1km due north and 8km back to where it started.

Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n>Output:		This is one of many logical sequences that lead to a multiple choice question format. In this sequence, we start with a building (the floor) and a direction (up), then a church (the floor, but not a direction). So, it's really asking you _"where can I sit facing the same direction as everything else, but from a high vantage point?"_<n>The answer, in ascending order of complexity to your question:<n>Theater, building, conference. In the theater, everyone is looking at the same thing: you can't see the audience from the stage. In a building, the front of the room is not higher than the back, so they're all the same height. Same in a conference room, which is probably not a church or an actual room if so, but a conference hall.<n>I think that the final answer is the Theater.<n><n>Input: When you are a teenager and your parents do not understand you, what is your average age?<n>Output: In this question, the average is being applied to an unbounded collection (teens) and some of this collection might be less than 13, for example, 12. So, the average is undefined.<n><n>Input:A cowboy rode horseback from Oklahoma to California and back in 45 days. What fraction of the entire trip was actually spent on horseback?<n>Output: In order to get the answer 50%, you would need to ride an average of 350 miles per day, taking zero breaks. Assuming horseback riding is inefficient - so you can't ride 500+ miles in a day - then this number is meaningless to compare to the overall trip length.<n>The reason this works intuitively is (as [@MattGibson87](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2563927/mattgibson87) mentioned) that it's a "how many days?" question: it doesn't matter whether he walked (or drove for that matter) to the end of the trip, just whether he walked and/or rode a horse for a significant portion of his travel.<n><n>Input: How much candy is at the bottom of the bag?<n>Output: If there is no sugar, no caramel, just water!

The movie theatre and state park are not really places in which one would see cotton candy and popcorn respectively. This answers B and E. This leaves us with three more options, A, C and D. State Park is the only choice that would fit the description. In soccer games, cotton candy isn't usually sold, and it is a rare sight in countryside locations as well. Option D is the least probable, leaving us with A and C. The cotton candy may be left over from a weekend event, or it may have come from a fair. If it's a fairground, then the popcorn would be likely as well. Popcorn is a classic carnival food, usually sold at the booths or by the hot dog guy, and the person may assume there was a fairground nearby because the cotton candy would also be sold on these grounds.<n><n>Output: There were <<$50+4*2=$4+1=5>>50 students at the basketball game and <<$50-4*2=$4$4>>4 students who attended the game.<n><n>Five hundred fifty dollars was the total revenue at the basketball game.<n><n>Output: Three times six is 18<n><n>Three is 3<n>Six is 6<n>6 is 3*2<n><n>Output: 4 squared is 16<n><n>4 squared is really what we know as 4*4 = 16.

Choices:  A: airplane B: construction site C: shops D: engine E: broken bone<n>Output:		Most people have to buy bus tickets, a train ticket or an airplane ticket. An airplane has an engine on board that requires metal rod. There could even be metal rods in the frame of the plane or the interior. A construction site is probably the second place you might find metal rods, because it holds up the building. In your vehicle, if it's used as a tool box for household chores, you might also see metal rods that are used for nails, screws, and other various tools that you use when you are remodeling your home. All in all there are three places where metal rods could be found, an airplane, your vehicle or home, and in a construction site. Hope this helps!

Since the child was playing the game free as a gift, they spent the money on the game for themselves.<n>In the case for (C), the entire "child's parents" were doing the behavior, and indeed the question does not qualify what it is referring to by "the child". Thus the microtransactions were actually being contained to the child.<n>In the case (D), it is ambiguous how the microtransactions were referred to, whether by the child or by the child's parent. It seems natural for the child's parent to make those microtransactions. So even if the child is the focal person, the microtransactions are not catching the child. (In all cases, there is only one child, so there would be no need for pluralization by the child's parents.)<n>Since (A) and (C) cover the case where the child was the focus, the only case left is (B) where the parents were being captured. Thus the final answer is A or C<n><n>Input: There are 160 books of the English bookcase, 64 books from the European shelf, and 103 books not collected.

Since there is not a lot of information from the assignment, it is difficult to guess what you are supposed to write.

I hope this help, take a look at the [tour] and [ask].<n><n>Comment: I suggest you give each test case a headline indicating which test case it is.<n><n>Comment: @ThomasK. The assignment reads that the questions must be answered in "short,  concise, and straightforward sentences". The assignment also requires the solution as a list of multiple choice questions. This doesn't change what information this code review requests.<n><n>Comment: Hi @ThomasK., I added the test cases to the question. I hope this is enough for you! I just want to add one thing. There are no questions that need to be answered in list.<n><n>Comment: I think you should change the instruction to something along the lines: 'Answer the following multiple choice questions. Each question is marked with an ID.' That way, you could easily add additional testcases, and it would be clear to other users that questions 1,2,3,etc. should be answered for the respective question ID.  For example: <ol start="1" id="M1-1"><li class="q-11">Answer the following multiple choice [...] </ol><n><n>Comment: Another thing you should consider is adding the input (for each question) as well as the output.

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Output: Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies is 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55<n>Let's say the number of Schnauzers is s.<n>The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is s-20<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90, meaning 55+s-20=90.<n>The number of Schnauzers which is s+55-20=90<n>This evaluates to s+35=90<n>There are s=<<55=55>>55 Schnauzers<n>So the final answer is 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Output: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>So the final answer is 36<n><n>Input:Where would you see some people standing on a line near a road? Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n>Output:		Fire houses use fire trucks and use water to fight a fire. That water has to be brought along with them in a tanker truck. So you would see them near fire houses to fill those trucks with water before they head off to a fire. Apartment buildings have a water source inside the building, but they would need help if there's a fire or leak. So they might be near an outside fire hydrant. Water fountains don't have anything to do with this. A military base is a large open area where a vehicle may require water to help clean the vehicle. A military vehicle normally does not have a lot of room. A bus stop would normally have some water fountains (usually hand water fountains), but would probably not house a large fleet of water trucks. If a building has a lot of parking area, then one could just look to see water fountains, or they could use a sprinkler system.

If each bag is evenly distributed in the plane, how much extra fuel could the plane fly with 300lb people aboard in addition to the cement?<n>Answer: One small, single-engine plan can hold up to 10 bags (240lbs each) of cement in the plane.<n>There are 300lbs per person (4/5 of a bag each), and an addition to the passengers weighs 240 lbs x 5. Thus the airplane can hold 35 bags of cement plus 150lbs of passengers = 2000lbs = 950 lbs. per person.<n>Note: This means the airplane can hold a plane of passengers of 350lbs, plus 650 lb of cement. This would not work out because we know the maximum is 35 bags x 240 =2040 pounds. So we know 0.5 bags are not accounted for by adding people, which makes a person have an additional 0.5 baggage, or 45lbs.<n><n>You may have noticed that adding in the passengers and subtracting cement bags from this equation works out to the correct number, so we can ignore the additional.5 bags and subtract from the weight of each passenger. = 10 bags minus 5 bags = 5 bags per person<n><n>After this, 5 * 35 people per bag = 175lbs, that is equal to 20 lbs shy of the correct number

The colors and peanuts must be mixed to make a total of ten different bags of M&Ms.<n>Output:Each 10-color M&M mix bag requires eight bags of M&MS.<n><n>Each bag of M&Ms needs different quantities of each color, so let's group M&Ms by color.<n>There needs to be two peanut bags for each color bag.<n>So there are eight bags for the total 10 colors, and 2 bags of peanuts.<n>The quantities of the colors in each bag will depend on the group for the bag.<n>The first bag will have two M&M colors with the peanuts.<n>Then the second bag will be two colors but no peanuts.<n>This will continue on to bag ten.<n><n>In the first bag, there will be two M&M colors and two peanuts.<n>In the second, there will be two colors with no peanut.<n>In the third, it will be the same as the first with two M&M colors, two peanuts. Same for the fourth.<n>And so on until bag ten.<n><n>It's easy to group them because it's just M&Ms of the same color.<n>So let's see if there are any special considerations.<n>The peanuts are in four bags, which means that there have to be the same colors in each bag, so there's only four colors available to go.<n>So only one of each color has to be used.<n>So each bag will only be four of each color, which puts in some restrictions on which bags get what colors.<n>For example, in any bag, two colors must be brown.<n>Let's draw a chart to keep everything organized.<n>Our starting colors are: blue, brown, green, orange, purple, red, and yellow.<n><n>Input:There has to be exactly two of each color in a mix.<n>Output

Choices:  A: violence B: falling down C: vomiting D: vomiting E: lower standards<n>Output:		<n>Violence- Violence is highly likely to occur since someone experiencing strong emotions (e.g., anger) at the moment of alcohol use are generally more likely to become violent.<n>Falling down - While it is certainly possible that a person who has been drinking may stumble or fall down, there are many other reasons that someone may stumble or fall that do not involve intoxication (e.g., dark alley).<n>Vomiting - There is no evidence that vomiting is more associated with people who have been drinking. In addition, vomiting alone is not necessarily a sign of intoxication. There is no reliable measure to determine how much of a person has ingested (or is in their bloodstream), so there is really no way to determine whether or not a person has been drinking "too much" through the amount they are vomiting. However, vomiting may be due to other things such as an allergy to alcohol (alcohol may cause severe nausea in some people) or simply due to eating.<n>Lower standards - There is no reason to believe that people who get drunk lower their standards of behavior. In fact, the fact that they are getting drunk may be the sign that they have a low standard of behavior since the reason to drink alcohol is generally because it makes people feel more confident and relaxed.<n><n>Input:What time do children usually eat their lunches in a school cafeteria?<n><n>Output: Choices:  between 12:00-12:15 between 12:15-12:30 between 12:30-12:45 between 12::00-12::15 between 13:00-13:15 between 0:00-0:15<n><n>Lunch is traditionally served during the time that it takes for your body to digest the food.

It is believed that by using a simple data structure like an array or a list to store them will be more efficient than using a hashmap, which could create an overly complicated data structure. This company has five types of data that need to be stored and organized. This data is structured as the following: 1. One field of string data 2. Four fields of numeric data 3. Three fields of string data 4. Three fields of numeric data 5. Four fields of numeric-string data There are three questions the company faces: 1. What type of data structure would work well for the data, and which would be the best in terms of performance and ease of use? They would assume the list data will hold a constant amount of data. 2. If they were to assume the data will double in size, what data structure will work well for this data? Would they still use a list? 3.

How long will they be moving with each meter they move in a direction perpendicular to their original motion?<n>Output: The following formula is needed for this problem: a*t=d, where t is the time per unit of speed, in this case meters per second. So a=<<a=1>>1 (since meters per second is one unit per unit of time).<n>Solving this equation d= 1*t.<n>Since a person is moving with a constant speed, it's not changing throughout the motion.

What is the smallest possible decrease in price from 1% to 0% in 100 days?<n>Output: The function f(x)=(1*x^2) to the 3/100 can be simplified into f(x)=<<f(x)=1/3x + x>>1/3x+x, with x being the number of decreases in percentage in the stock price. It gives the amount of price drop in each day as x/3.  Since x is set to 0 in 100 day period, we can set it to -150, which will have the answer -5, because f(-150)/3 = f(5)/3 = -5. So the smallest drop in percentage from 1 to 0 in 200 days is -5.<n><n>Input: A store has eight days’ worth of water.

Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n>Output:		The correct answer is D, social activism.<n>If someone wants to change society, there are two options: A, starting from within, or B, social activism. Starting from within can mean rioting and other activities that could get you arrested. So it's not an option, which means that B must be social activism. The reason is that the word society implies doing something bigger than one individual's personal problems. Then change yourself. Although you can't help others if you don't help yourself, it doesn't mean changing yourself in order to change society. Instead, that person is trying to change society through her/his personal behavior. Finally, changing clothes is not a way to do something that results<n>        in changing society.<n>The only option left is social activism.<n><n>Input:The product of nine and a number is equal to eight times the product of the number and 11.What is the difference between the two original numbers?<n>Output:Let's start by factoring the two numbers:<n>    let N and M be the two number.

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n>Output:		Inflation is a rise in the general level of prices over time. As costs increase, the purchasing power of money decreases.<n>A successful fight against inflation can be beneficial in a variety of ways. Some advantages are:<n><n>Inflation makes the prices of the products in the economy unstable. The increase in the number of inflation is bad for society. Fighting inflation can make the prices of products more stable and less unstable.<n>Fighting inflation can be good for people living in a third world country. It can improve the overall living standards in such countries.<n>Deflation happens when there is an economic decline. People become hesitant to spend money and wait for the price to reduce. This can affect the businesses.<n>When inflation and deflation takes place at the same time it may lead to volatility in the economy. It can lead to economic instability within a country, as there would be no assurance from the point to the market value of goods and services. This will lead to a fluctuating currency. This could lead to a rise in interest rates leading to increased debt and ultimately a fall in the economy.<n><n>The choice you want us to select<n><n>Answer:<n><n>Instruction:Your program should take no arguments and print the statement that best describes the given choice.

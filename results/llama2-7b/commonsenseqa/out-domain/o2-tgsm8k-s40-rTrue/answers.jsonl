There are one hundred boxes that are four feet apart for a total distance of 400 feet. Since the youngest child is going to be following the trail of toy boxes for the rest of the day, let's determine the total distance as to how long it would take for them to finish. Let's say the trail ends 100 feet later at 500 feet. (400 + 500 = 900) So the youngest child would have to walk 3/4 mile to get to the box that the eldest placed at the beginning of the trail. Because the distance between the boxes are four feet, the youngest child can walk four of the boxes at a time", "answer": "D: lap"}

No other colors are present. How many balls of each color do you expect to find on the top two balls removed from the box?\nOutput: The answer to this problem is C, three blue balls on the first ball and four on the second. You can start by just picking two random balls from the box.

Each cocoa bean has a certain percentage (by mass) of white substance.  The cocoa beans contain 19% white substance. The cocoa beans are processed and the white substance is removed from each bean. The total weight of white substance removed from all the cocoa beans is 1.6 kilograms. How much more cocoa powder was produced from the white substance than was produced from the pure cocoa beans?\nOutput: White substance (by volume) contains a certain percentage by volume of cocoa powder.  So, by Volume, the white substance is 81% cocoa beans and 19% white powder.\nThe weight of white substance is 1.6 kg so, by mass it is 1600kg and by volume it is 81% = 1.3. So let's call it 1.4kg.\n1.6kg has 19% of pure cocoa beans by volume (81% * 19% = 15.8%). So there would be 81% of this, or 13%.\nThe percentage of cocoa beans remaining is 86% remaining so multiply by volume to get the amount of mass left 86% * 1.3kg/81% * 81% = <<1.3kg/ <<86% * 81, 19% > 81% * 6% > 81, 9% cocoa beans\nTherefore the final answer is more by volume.\nInput: Six dogs will be at the dog park on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Choices: A: Yes B: No\nOutput: We can assume that there was a mistake in the census which was taken to create the list of Titanic passengers. When the ship sank, each cabin was emptied and given away to surviving passengers. A large number of women didn't board the lifeboats and instead went into one of the lifeboats by themselves. Once some men found themselves in the women only-cabins they would have taken one of these lifeboats.\n\nSince two lifeboats are 24 people, this would mean that there were 24 women on the lifeboats. If all men had boarded lifeboats with women who did not survive, why would there be 24 women but only 12 men on the lifeboat? The only explanations could be: <<only 12 men on lifeboats>>\n\n# Women are more afraid to be rescued than men and are therefore more likely to hide themselves in small areas\n# Men are more desperate for survival and so more likely to leave women than the reverse is true\n\nAside from survival instincts, the only other explanation is that men were not all in the lifeboats, leaving women on the lifebeats, but when men came by, they left and when men were rescued, they assumed that all the women were aboard the lifeboats which was not the case. Then, once rescued, each cabin was emtpy so only men were in the lifeboat, so on that trip, the lifebo", "answer": "C: control children"}

What is the number of digits in n?\nOutput: We use the trick of listing all the possible cases in a table, and noting the values of N = number of digits, and J = maximum number of subsets each digit of N can have.\n\nN J\n3 10\n4 12\n6 7\n7 6\n9 6\n10 3\n\nAs J is the maximum integer, we can sum the products of N x J (by multiplying by 0 or 1 for the subsets that cannot apply).\n\nLet's sum up all N, then the maximum integer.\n\n$$\\sum\\left(\\left(N\\times(N-1)\\right)^{J-1}\\right) = \\left(N\\times J\\right)^{(J-1)}N!$$\n\n$$= \\left(3\\times 9\\right)^{(3-1)} * 3!=6\\times 27!$$\n\n$$6\\times 4!=240$$\n\n$$6*240=1440$$\n\nSince J=6\n$$144", "answer": "B: binder"}

However, I think that I should've paid more attention to the instructions of the question. We were asked to solve the problem for the output number 67, so I put the 29 for that part. I was going to put 29 for the second part but I didn't notice a change in the question type.

If I had studied more for this section or remembered that the answer was from a previous section, I think I could've gotten a higher score. In retrospect, I didn't look at the previous sections enough to see if my questions have been answered or not so the same struggles were repeated on the fourth part.\n\n3.\tI struggled on the fourth part because of the same thing as with part three.

If I had noticed that I was losing points, I would've been able to complete parts four and five quicker and could've gotten higher scores.\n\n4.\tI knew the process of using the instructions. Since I took the GRE previously, I knew a lot about their format so that wasn't the issue. The thing that I struggled with was remembering to apply that process to all sections. Since my score kept on going up after part one, I didn't really worry about using the instructions in other parts.

How many cookied are left?\nOutput: To help answer this question I looked at this question as a equation and wrote out all the variables. I made a equation: 85 - 19 = <<$85-19=66>>66 chocolate chip cookies - 22 = <<$66-22=44>>44. Since 44 is smaller than 85 I wrote an equation with only the small 44. 66- 44 = <<$66\\-44=22>>22 I combined both 44 and 22 into 44-22= <<$66+22=44\\-66+22>>44(minus)22(plus).  It is now time to solve for the value of 44, to do so I made the equation 66+22 = 44(minus) 22. When you do this it gives you 66+2= 64 which is the solution\nThe final answer is 22\n\nInput: A truck can carry 4000 books at a time. A train can carry 800 boxes at a time. A plane can carry up to 400 passengers. How many people would have to board a train to transport as many people as one truck and one plane could transport?\nOutput:  I first found the combined number of boxes that a truck and plane can transport by multiplying 4000 by 400. This equals 1,600,000. Then I find the combined amount of books that a train and plane can transport by simply multiplying 800 by 1600000. This gives you the answer 128,000,00. Since we can have more people on a train than on a plane, this is how I would divide this number in half, so the answer is 64,000, and the final answer is 64000\n\nInput: What is twice 15 plus three times -", "answer": "B: generous"}

Twenty-five people had not decided on their final destination, 43 had a destination in mind and 24 were definitely going to the Caribbean.

Therefore, we use division to find the ratio. We could also use the formula division = (ration * denominator)  / (numerator * denominator).\n\nWe must first simplify 47 by making the denominator equal to 100 and get the ratio\nOf 47 people only 25 were undecided.\nTherefore, (ration * denominater) = (25*100) divided by (47*100) which equals\n\n$$$\\frac {25}{47 *100}$$\n\n\n$$$\\frac 25$$\n\nWe must also do this the other way around to figure out the denominator, to get\n\n$$$ \\frac {total* 100$} or (25*1.1796) = 27.23\n\n\n$$$ \\dfrac{27.23} {\\frac{47} {100}} = \\frac 25\n$$\n\n$$$ \\rightarrow \\frac 25$$ = 1, means that 25 people had a destination in mind to every 1 person who definitely was going to the Caribbeans.\n\n### Input\nI = { 'x', 'y '}\nF = { a, b, c}\nHow many elements are in I?

Bananas cost $1 each, but a bunch of bananas costs $6.  The price of a bunch of bananas and an apple is $10. How many bananas can be bought with $10?\nOutput:10 - (10-3) = <<10- 3> = 7>>7 bananas.\nThis answer is because the price of an apple is 3$ and bananas are 1$ each. So it would be 100 bananas - 6apple = 94 apples and 6 bananas - 1 apple = 5 bananas. Because the total is so close to 100 banana and 6 apples, the apples could be rounded down to 7 apples and therefore the answer to how many bananas could be bought with 10$ is 100 - 3 = <<97> = 97>>97 bananas.\n\nInput: The month of June had 32 days.

What do you get?\nOutput: The answer to the second question can be determined by just simply using a formula.\n9/((9+13)/11) = 9*11/(9*11) = 59/(13*11) = ((59*11)/13)/11 = ((59/13)*11)/11 = 590/131 = 4/5\nThe answer to the second question is 4/5\n\nInput: The average weight of the three students above is 122 pounds. How has the average weight changed as the weight of the students have changed?\nOutput: Let's say the old average is w1 (122) and the new average is w2. So we want to compute w2.\nFirst multiply w1 by 1 to get w1*1=122 w1\nThen simply subtract w3 from w2. w2-w3 = (123-115)/2\nSince there is an odd number of numbers, we don't know what the fraction will be so we want to round to the closest number. (123-w2)/2\nThus, the new average is w1+w3- (123- (w1+w3)/2 or w1/(1-2)+w3/(1+2)) = w", "answer": "E: embarrassment"}

Rugged Off-road tires are built with studded lugs, so they have 360 studs on each tire. The other two types of tires have studs spaced evenly on the tires, so there are 180 studs each. The 180 stud tires are the best selling tire. The managers are contemplating selling the 360 stud tires as well, but they have cost doubts. The tires are very expensive to produce and they don't sell well. To get an idea of what they can charge, they know that the two 180 studd tires together cost $1,200 to make. The same type of two tires made without the studs cost $900 to make. Can the tires with 360 stud cost at least $900?\nOutput: Yes, the 360-stud tires costs more than $900: 1,200 \u00f7 360 > 900 \u00f7 2.\n\nInput: Two trains are leaving at 1:03pm and 1:29pm, each traveling at the same speed, and headed in the same direction from two train stations that are at least 30 miles apart.

The only way to make a=b=0 is if a were the identity of b because a=b then a=b=0 which would mean a=0. This is a contradiction because if a=b=0 then a can't equal to 0. Therefore, a does not equals b. <<A>>A\n\nInput: Is the following statement true or false. All dogs are mammals, some mammals are not dogs.

How much money did the magician have before his last show?\n```\n$25\n```\n\nInput:\nA magician's next performance is a show involving money, and it is his last show. At his last show he had $25 in change. But for all previous shows, there never are any coins.\nThis time for his last show he wants to break the coins into three piles. But this time he wants to have coins other than pennies. To make matters worse, there must be as equal a number of nickels, dimes, and quarters across each pile. Here is a diagram:\n\n```\n$ _ _ _ _ _ _ $\n```\n\nOutput:\nFirst let's say he has 1 nickel, 5 dimes, and 1 quarter. This won't work because 5 dimes make 5 quarters. It won't work with 5 nickels either because 5 nickels make 1 quarter, and this won't work with just 1 quarter. But what about 2 quarters?\n```\n$ _______$\n\n```\nYou will get 2 dimes and 1 nickel. So 1 quarter, 5 dimes and 1 quarter, 2 dimes and then one nickel.\nSo in this case $1, $1 and $2.\n```\n\n25. What do you have to do to escape the dungeon? Choices: A. Pick the lock. B.

A group of citizens of the kingdom met and created a protest movement stating that the king did not have the right to kill a citizen. The king was angered because this protest was against the kings decision. He ordered to have all the protesters executed. The group included 23 boys and 13 girls.

We use it to describe general moments of well-being as well as being surprised by something good that happens. \nFor instance, you might say, \u201cShe was happy when she bought her first house.\u201d (She was very glad.) You could also say, \u201cWe were happy at the surprise party!\u201d (We were astonished and happy to see our friends.) Or, \u201cHe was happy to win another gold medal at the Olympics.\u201d (He was pleased to win another gold medal.)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to use it to describe an action, we do it the exact same way. \"Tom was happy to dance with his wife.\" (Tom was happy to dance.) We use a specific form to talk about our action, like when we were happily singing and dancing at an event. We use it to say that you were happy, in its fullest sense, in the process of singing, like when you danced to your favorite song in front of the mirror. When we use it to say that we did something, usually something positive, we also use the form with the present participle, like Danny was happily singing in front of his\n      class. If you want to talk about something that is continuing happening, you have to use a different form, as we have discussed above. \n\n\nIf you were to ask, \u201chow many of you are happy?\u201d you would hear, \u201cWe were happy when you brought your favorite ice cream flavor!\u201d (We enjoyed eating ice cream.) \nWhen we ask questions, we use it in the contracted form, as in \u201cAre you happy today?\u201d (Are you happy?)\n\nWe do not use it in the progressive form very much. When we do, it always means being contented. We wouldn\u2019t say \u201cI am happily driving in traffic.\u201d (I am driving in traffic) but rather, \u201cI am happily content behind the wheel.\u201d\nWe also don\u2019 input:Danny was having a lot of A.B.C.D.E. laughter.\nHis class was having fun and they enjoyed Danny\u2019s singing. \nDanny had fun singing.", "answer": "C: glee"}

{"text": "The words \"sleep\" and \"sleeping\" are very similar but their meanings are not quite the same. When I say I took a nap on Sunday, I mean I was having a rest. My cousin, on the other hand, is a very sound sleeper. We can use the word \"nap\" because his brain is resting for a short period of time. But if I were only having a rest, then it'd be more accurate to say that, \"I am having a nap.\" So instead of using the word \"sleep,\" better to use \"nap.\"\nThe word \"sleep\" means to be in a state, to calm down or to be at rest; the word \"sleeping\" means to pass from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious.

{"text": "This is one of many logical sequences that lead to a multiple choice question format. In this sequence, we start with a building (the floor) and a direction (up), then a church (the floor, but not a direction). So, it's really asking you _\"where can I sit facing the same direction as everything else, but from a high vantage point?\"_\nThe answer, in ascending order of complexity to your question:\nTheater, building, conference. In the theater, everyone is looking at the same thing: you can't see the audience from the stage. In a building, the front of the room is not higher than the back, so they're all the same height. Same in a conference room, which is probably not a church or an actual room if so, but a conference hall.\nI think that the final answer is the Theater.\n\nInput: When you are a teenager and your parents do not understand you, what is your average age?\nOutput: In this question, the average is being applied to an unbounded collection (teens) and some of this collection might be less than 13, for example, 12.

Assuming horseback riding is inefficient - so you can't ride 500+ miles in a day - then this number is meaningless to compare to the overall trip length.\nThe reason this works intuitively is (as [@MattGibson87](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2563927/mattgibson87) mentioned) that it's a \"how many days?\" question: it doesn't matter whether he walked (or drove for that matter) to the end of the trip, just whether he walked and/or rode a horse for a significant portion of his travel.\n\nInput: How much candy is at the bottom of the bag?\nOutput: If there is no sugar, no caramel, just water!

What is the largest integer that cannot be split into groups of two whole appes in this fashion? We know it won't be greater than 16. Let's see what the number is from the largest we know. (24-1)/2= 12 so we know it can be split into groups of only 2 apples.\nOutput: We know that the number is greater than 16 and less than 112 for the same reasons. The number is 73 and you can't split that into groups.\n\nOutput: The greatest common factor of 28 and 42 is 1.\n\nOutput:1\n\nOutput: A and B are in the same group.  So there are 5 people in the group and 3 boys and 2 girls. The percentages are 3/10 which is 30%.\n\nInput: The sum of the cubes of the digits of a number is the number times that number.

You stay later at work.  You take time off from work.  You go on vacation.  During these times and others like them, your friend may have to be delayed.  Since you are delayed because you have to make a connection, you are not necessarily delayed because you were going somewhere you normally don't go.\nIt doesn't matter what James, the man in the story, is doing.  What matters is that he had to make a connection to arrive earlier than his normal arrival time.\nSince James missed his connection, he could not arrive at the destination earlier without stopping at the airport.  He arrived at his final destination at a time that was different than he originally expected.  So, if he had not done a connection, he would have not been late to meet his friend.\nTherefore, he could not have been delayed because of any of the other answers, because they all involve some time away from his normal routine.\nSo, the final answer is B.\n\nOutput: Dr. Banks gave away 2684.7 teeth brushes from January to May.

So you would see them near fire houses to fill those trucks with water before they head off to a fire. Apartment buildings have a water source inside the building, but they would need help if there's a fire or leak. So they might be near an outside fire hydrant. Water fountains don't have anything to do with this. A military base is a large open area where a vehicle may require water to help clean the vehicle. A military vehicle normally does not have a lot of room.

If each bag is evenly distributed in the plane, how much extra fuel could the plane fly with 300lb people aboard in addition to the cement?\nAnswer: One small, single-engine plan can hold up to 10 bags (240lbs each) of cement in the plane.\nThere are 300lbs per person (4/5 of a bag each), and an addition to the passengers weighs 240 lbs x 5. Thus the airplane can hold 35 bags of cement plus 150lbs of passengers = 2000lbs = 950 lbs. per person.\nNote: This means the airplane can hold a plane of passengers of 350lbs, plus 650 lb of cement. This would not work out because we know the maximum is 35 bags x 240 =2040 pounds. So we know 0.5 bags are not accounted for by adding people, which makes a person have an additional 0.5 baggage, or 45lbs.\n\nYou may have noticed that adding in the passengers and subtracting cement bags from this equation works out to the correct number, so we can ignore the additional.5 bags and subtract from the weight of each passenger. = 10 bags minus 5 bags = 5 bags per person\n\nAfter this, 5 * 35 people per bag = 175lbs, that is equal to 20 lbs shy of the correct number", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

Train A is 20 miles long and Train B is 30 miles long. At what constant speed must each train travel to prevent any passengers from seeing each other during the journey?\nOutput:To find out whether they can pass each other we need to calculate the velocity v of trains A and B.\n\nFor train A, we can write its velocity in the form of\n```\nv=v1+v2\n```\nwhere 'v' is the velocity of train A and 'v1' and 'v2' are some constants.\n\nSince v2=<0> we get\n```\nv=<960/60>+v2\n``` or in other words v=<13>+v2.\n\nWe repeat the exact same process for train B to get.\n```\nv=360+v2\n``` where 'v = <1920/60>' or 'v=<32>+v2'.\n\nSubstituting values we get\n```\n13+(32)=<32>+13\n```\nand\n```\n32+1920=<1920>+32\n```\n\nOr as a vector v1=(<13>,<32>) and v2=(<0>,<1920/360>= <1920>).\n\nSolving for the two trains velocities we get\n```\n\\[v_1^2+v_2^2=\\left(\\frac{(960+360) \\times 60}{60}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{1560 \\times 60 }{60}\\right)\\]\n``` while the velocity of each train is `93.3 m/s`\n\nHowever, to solve for the possible velocities of the trains we cannot solve for v2, due to the fact that v2<0.

{"text": "Violence- Violence is highly likely to occur since someone experiencing strong emotions (e.g., anger) at the moment of alcohol use are generally more likely to become violent.\nFalling down - While it is certainly possible that a person who has been drinking may stumble or fall down, there are many other reasons that someone may stumble or fall that do not involve intoxication (e.g., dark alley).\nVomiting - There is no evidence that vomiting is more associated with people who have been drinking. In addition, vomiting alone is not necessarily a sign of intoxication. There is no reliable measure to determine how much of a person has ingested (or is in their bloodstream), so there is really no way to determine whether or not a person has been drinking \"too much\" through the amount they are vomiting. However, vomiting may be due to other things such as an allergy to alcohol (alcohol may cause severe nausea in some people) or simply due to eating.\nLower standards - There is no reason to believe that people who get drunk lower their standards of behavior. In fact, the fact that they are getting drunk may be the sign that they have a low standard of behavior since the reason to drink alcohol is generally because it makes people feel more confident and relaxed.\n\nInput:What time do children usually eat their lunches in a school cafeteria?\n\nOutput: Choices:  between 12:00-12:15 between 12:15-12:30 between 12:30-12:45 between 12::00-12::15 between 13:00-13:15 between 0:00-0:15\n\nLunch is traditionally served during the time that it takes for your body to digest the food.

I take out $200 from the basket and deposit it into my bank account. As a result, I have now have a total of $1200 in my account. The next day, after paying for all my bills, I only have $500 left in my account. Now there are only two possible combinations. First, the basket can only have $0.00 remaining in it. That would mean I'd have $500 in my account, and I would have $500 to spend. But that's not the case because I do have some money left over and have $500 the to spend. So that means I have a $1,001 basket. There's only a single combination. And that is that the basket has $501.00 remaining in the basket. The other $500 must have been deposited into my banking account as the problem states.\nOutput: The basket has 501 dollars and the remaining amount of money is the money left in my banking account.\n\nInput: \nWe have a basket with 1,000 dollars in it.\nWe take 500 dollars from the basket and depos", "answer": "C: smooth skin"}

It is believed that by using a simple data structure like an array or a list to store them will be more efficient than using a hashmap, which could create an overly complicated data structure. This company has five types of data that need to be stored and organized. This data is structured as the following: 1. One field of string data 2. Four fields of numeric data 3. Three fields of string data 4. Three fields of numeric data 5. Four fields of numeric-string data There are three questions the company faces: 1. What type of data structure would work well for the data, and which would be the best in terms of performance and ease of use? They would assume the list data will hold a constant amount of data. 2. If they were to assume the data will double in size, what data structure will work well for this data? Would they still use a list? 3. If the data is supposed to hold a million items, which data structure would work for this purpose? \n\nOutput:\nThe five pieces of data can be arranged as shown below:  {1: 1, 2: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 7}  {1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 5, 4: 3, 5: 9}  {1: 'A', 2: 'B', 3: 'C', 4: 'D'}  {1: 43, 2: 48, 3: 8, 4: 102}  {1: {('a': 23, 'b': 13, 'c': 56), ('d': 23, 29, 35)}, 2: {('e': 2, 'f': 5, 'g': 68), ('h': 4, 'i': 41)}, 3: {('j': 52, 'k': 86, 'l': 129)}, 4: {('m': 44", "answer": "A: shelf"}

How long will they be moving with each meter they move in a direction perpendicular to their original motion?\nOutput: The following formula is needed for this problem: a*t=d, where t is the time per unit of speed, in this case meters per second. So a=<<a=1>>1 (since meters per second is one unit per unit of time).\nSolving this equation d= 1*t.\nSince a person is moving with a constant speed, it's not changing throughout the motion.

What is the smallest possible decrease in price from 1% to 0% in 100 days?\nOutput: The function f(x)=(1*x^2) to the 3/100 can be simplified into f(x)=<<f(x)=1/3x + x>>1/3x+x, with x being the number of decreases in percentage in the stock price. It gives the amount of price drop in each day as x/3.  Since x is set to 0 in 100 day period, we can set it to -150, which will have the answer -5, because f(-150)/3 = f(5)/3 = -5.

{"text": "The correct answer is D, social activism.\nIf someone wants to change society, there are two options: A, starting from within, or B, social activism. Starting from within can mean rioting and other activities that could get you arrested. So it's not an option, which means that B must be social activism. The reason is that the word society implies doing something bigger than one individual's personal problems. Then change yourself. Although you can't help others if you don't help yourself, it doesn't mean changing yourself in order to change society. Instead, that person is trying to change society through her/his personal behavior.

The way i did it was finding the length of the list, then creating a counter in a nested loop from zero to 47, which is the length of the list. The loop works, as it will only loop the length of the list as we found the length at the very beginning.\n\nThe problem was finding the first and last element that is above this, and the middle. We will use two nested lists for this, the first list we find the first and last element:\n    Elements 1 = 277\n    Elements 2 = 166\nTo find the second and third element. we'd find the middle\n\nthe second and third\nOutput = Elements 1 = Elements 2\nThe problem arises when the user's input is not exactly 50 in every list, which happens in these exercises.

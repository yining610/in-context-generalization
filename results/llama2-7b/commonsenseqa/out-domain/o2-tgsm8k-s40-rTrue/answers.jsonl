If the dimensions of the tin are 2 meters by 3 meters, and the dimensions of the fishing line, the toy elephant and the fishing rod are the same proportions, what is the dimensions of the  fishing rod?\n\n### Rationales\n\nThe dimensions of the fishing rod, the toy elefrant, and the spool of fishing lime can all fit in the tin provided the proportions are correct.\nEach of the proportions can be represented by a linear equation.\nConsider the equation y=2x, a linear equation representing a proportional relationship.\nEach linear equation representing a proportional relatinoship with the same constant value 5 is represented by the general form Ax+By+C = 0.\nThe solution for x when y=2x is represented by (2x)/x = -5/2.\nSubstituting the given constants into the expression yields a quadratic relationship.\nThe positive root represents how much of one variable needs to be subtracted from the other to get zero.\nThat relationship is -5/2. The solution to the quadratic relationship is x = -2\nGiven that the dimensions of the fishline, a toy elefant and the fishig rod are the same proportianl ratio, the dimension of the fishing rod is -2.\n\n#### -2\nAnswer: -2\n\n### Input \n\nInput:\nThe ratio of the width of the rectangular tin to its height is 10 to 4.

So her total was 1,608 and she has only hired eight chefs, so that leaves her with 1,601 which was what she hired eight chefs to be able to sell.\n\n**So now we have the remaining total of 1,007 meals to divide with eight chefs.\n**Since there are 1000, we can divide the meals by the number of chefs and get 125.\n\n\n**Answer:** 125%\n\n### Question : 2.

{"text": "Rationales:\n#### Shopping Bag Goes on the Car Trunk\n\nIf you put a shopping bag in the seat of the vehicle, there is not enough space.\nThe driver needs to be able to seat without being disturbed.\nIf you put a handbag on the roof of your car, you might risk breaking the car.\nThe only place left in your car is your trunk, unless you're willing to drive with items in laps and on your feet.\nThe trunk is the only space where you'll not put anything at risk, like your car.\n\n#### A shopping bag goes in the car Trunk\n\nRationales for response: The only place where you can store a shopping bag without putting anything at risk is your car's trunk. Drivers should stow their shopping bags in the car's trunk instead of carrying them in their laps or on their feet because doing so endangers your vehicle and yourself. Shopping bags must go in the trunk.\n\n#### Driving with shopping bags\n\nRationales Shopping bags should not be placed in the trunk. A shopping bag should not be stowed in the trunk because of the risks of a collision or damage to the vehicle in case the car has to come to a hard stop or a sudden turn. A shopping bag needs to be stored on the floor in front of all the sitting passengers. An occupant in a vehicle in the trunk has a higher probability of fatality in the event of an accident and they cannot be treated for injuries. Instead of a bag, one should carry a handbag or a small bag.\n\n#### Shopping Bag storage in the trunk\n\nRational for response:\nShopping bags should not go in the trunk because doing so presents risk to both the driver and the car. The car's back end will most certainly get damaged if the trunk is full. Furthermore, if the car were to stop abruptly or turn quickly, an object in the trunk that is not secured can impale the occupants or roll about and cause harm. To keep the car healthy and the passengers safe, shopping bags should be kept in the trunk as little as possible.

It is used to create software for operating systems and other applications. The programmers use specific features of the language in order to solve real-life problems by defining algorithms to manage variables that can be manipulated, which has a strong base of built-in functions. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. It is an object-oriented programming language. The syntax of C++ is based on C. A lot of computer science majors are required to take this course while other major programs use it for their application development needs such as data analytics or data science projects at the university, etc.\n\n### Output:\nC++ is a simple language designed to allow programmers to write portable code. It supports object-oriented features, including class definition, inheritance, and polymorphism in addition to being fast and efficient, making it one of the most widely used languages today for development and deployment in industry.\n\n### Demo answer\nI find C++ to be an excellent choice for any situation, including computer programming and other applications.

One could say that this is not a literal electric fan, but rather a fan as a unit (and thus can be used more than once) or that this is a figurative electric fan. The correct answer is that one could have more than one electric FAN in their HOME.\n\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThere are two separate ways in which to think about an electric fan, based on one's individual definition. If one believes that an electric fan is a physical thing that must have a separate space in a physical location, then they could only have one electric fan in their home but could have multiple fans as a unit (i.e. one can have a ceiling fan, box fan and pedestal fan in any number of rooms in their home). However, if one believes that an \"electric fan\" is a figurative description, one could have multiple units of electric fans at any one space, i.e. multiple ceiling fans, box fans and pedestal fans in one single room of their home.", "answer": "A: home"}

The second scenario is different since we are given with the difference between the sum of the Doberman Puppies and the Schnauzer. Now, you add to that a constant of 90. The thing that makes the problem difficult is that the Schnauzers do not change so they are the same number over the given span of six months. Therefore, it is more important to understand the difference between 55 and 35. The first half of your explanation is well thought out and very easy to grasp. In the second part of your explanation, you assume that the number of Schnauer changes from start to end of the given 6 months. However, that is not the case and does not make sense at all. Since no other variable changes, it is best to assume that the Schnauzer count remains the same throughout the given span. You are correct to determine the required subtraction to add the 90 to the answer. It is important to note that the Schnauze number does not change and therefore, a given number of 60 needs to be appended. Lastly, you need to note that the additional variable in the question is the number of Dobermans. With that being said, it is best to subtract 45 to provide the correct answer of 35.\n\n\n#### 1 A\n\n# 1 A\n#### 2\n\n#2:", "answer": "E: getting good grades"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Submission\n\n### Question:\nDuring the first months of the 19th century, there was great confusion over how U.S. money should be calculated:\n\n### Demand:\nIn the year 1800, when the United States was only 16 years old, it faced a difficult dilemma when it came to calculating the value and purchasing power of U.S. money. At its inception, the dollar was based upon the value of gold and was valued at 16 to 1, or $4.8625 per ounce. When the nation entered into a trade dispute with England, the value of these dollars was questioned by the government of England, who claimed that U.S. dollars were equivalent to 90% less a pound of sterling silver (24.5 carats). As such, these paper dollars had to be exchanged for actual silver coins (89% of an ounce) equal to the value of 9/10 a pound sterling. To make this easier to figure out, Congress used a one-pound sterling silver coin called a milled dollar instead of using a half-pound sterling coin so that the exchange rate could more easily be calculated. The milled dollar was in use at about $3 and 45/100 cents from 1805 to the time of the Civil War when the United States was 16 years old. What would it have cost you to buy a 1-pound sterling gold coin weighing about 250 grams for the face value of \u00a314.68? In addition, the Treasury Department had to print gold coinage which was worth more than its stated value. What would that 1-pound gold coin be worth?\n\n### Response Question:\nThe dollar was valued at 9/10 pounds of sterling silver. This was an exchange rate of around $.45 a pound sterling, which would be 24.5 carat silver. The weight of 9 pounds of gold was $42.5.\n\n### Rationale Question:\nA) The government had to exchange a sterling pound for more money than what the government actually printed. This meant that each of these dollars would be", "answer": "B: woods"}

In rare cases, the most common symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or even nausea and headache.

I can work this fast, even when I'm sick or I haven't had breakfast yet.\" Making Everything Easy's computer system automatically records the time that a box of merchandisewas unpacked. Margot thinks that if she could work 12 boxes a day, she could unpack each box faster than Betsy. \"I can unpack 12 boxes if I work fast, and if I work 9 hours each day, it still takes only 3 minutes extra for each box. I can make up this tiny extra time by being efficient. That's why I'm working 12 boxes each day,\" she says. Betsy's unpacking time is 99 seconds per box.

{"text": "This is a multiple choice question with choice A for the majority of the time fish spend their time in the body of water.\n\n### Inputs and outputs:\n\nInput:Fred, who was a police officer, was very careful with his work. He did not like to leave evidence lying around. But one day he had to put a body in a freezer to keep him from disintegrating. Fred put the body in the freezer and locked the door. The next day, however, Fred accidentally left the freezer on and by the time he remembered it was on, the body was all liquid, even though it had only been on for an hour. As a result, Fred had to clean up the freezer. The next day Fred began putting his evidence into an even smaller freezer where he would also be able to fit the big body. He found that every time he had to empty the first freezer, he put a lot of evidence into the second. He said to himself: \"The next day will be busy\".\nRationales:\nThis is a story problem that requires two steps to solve. The first step is to figure out the evidence in the first freezer. Step 1: Fred did not like leaving evidence lying around. Step 2: Every time Fred emptied the first freezer, the second freezer was also filled. At least there would be twice as much evidence in the second freezer.  Thus, the second freezer must hold more than just one piece of evidence.\nLet's say there are 100 pieces of evidence in the first freezers. Step 1: There would be at least 200 evidence in the second freezers (100 + 200 = 300)\nStep 2: When Fred empties one freezer, the other freezer also gets the pieces of evidence:\n200 / 2 = 100 in second freezers.\nThere remains, by least 100 evidence left in the first freezner.\n#### 100\nAnswer: 100\n\nInput:Dave had ten marbles.

Gold may be a great investment, but it is not gold that is the reserve so A is out.\n*B. the actual Strategic Gold Reserve is held by Fort Knox. This is a storage site for the gold kept in foreign nations. This gold is kept outside the United States. This is not the correct answer.\n*C. Treasure chests are a great place to keep gold, but are not held by the government in the United States. Therefore, C is out.\n*D. This is a great guess. The U.S. Gold Reserves are in the Fort Knox and this is held by the U.S. Treasury. This is a storage place for gold so the answer is D.\n\n### Explanation:\nSince the first question asked where the reserves were stored but provided no information regarding the quantity stored, we are left with a few options to consider. \n\nLet's use Fort Knox as an example to show how the logic is built.\n\n* Fort Knox does not store the Strategic Gold Reserve but holds the Reserves of foreign nations\n* Treasure Chests do not exist anymore at all\n* If a gold bullion is on hand outside of the United States, then the question is answered\n\nDue to the way the last option was worded, the first option is eliminated (since Fort Knox does not, in fact, contain the U.S. Strategic Gold Reserve). We then assume that the U.S. Gold Reserve is in fact stored outside the U.S. To determine this, Fort Knox' answer of option C is eliminated because gold is not stored in the treasure chest which seems to be a logical conclusion to many test-takers. This leaves us with the second and third option, since Fort Knox does not contain the Strategic Gold Reserves and the treasure chest has been eliminated as a possible storing location for gold. The third and last option still has a strong, reasonable logical assumption that gold would be kept at Fort Knox since this can no longer be considered since the second option has been eliminated.

{"text": "A: shelves on a desk at his place of work\n\n### Explanation: James doesn't use the term desk. The author doesn't state the exact area where James stored his clipboard on his desk. It could be any of the areas that the author doesn't specify.\nThe author refers to James' desk, not to his entire work place and he doesn't name a specific room, and he doesn't mention an exact place that James could easily find his clipboard. He doesn't indicate that he can find it at his workplace, at workstations, or at his office, either.\n\n### Input The author wrote:  The author wrote:  \"What if I\u2019d told you I had the best seat in town?\u201d What did the author of this sentence know that you didn\u2019t?\"\n\n### Response The author knows who asked the question.\n\n## Difficulty:\nThis question is moderately difficult.\nA moderate level of cognitive engagement is required which includes the understanding of multiple sentence level features. For instance, the question refers to \"the author\", a pronoun which can be confusing. In addition, \"what if I'd told\" is an expression. For this reason, \"what if\" refers to different words which are the product of a grammatical process, and can be confusing.\nThere is some ambiguity in the question. When answering the question, the meaning the question is referring to should be determined so as to determine the correct response. If this is incorrect, the response will be wrong.\n\n## Construct:\nThere is a task-based construct. This is a task based instruction, that requires a response. There is a statement that describes some tasks, and a response that should accomplish those tasks.\n\n## Authoring information:\nThis assessment template was created by Margarita Dikson, PhD.  This question was written by Margarita Dzikus.\nShe reviewed it with J.K. Pantzis, PhD. for the purposes of ensuring that the material presented was relevant and accurate.\n\n## Assessment:\nThis assessment will score the response and give feedback. The scoring and feedback may be automated or manual. The scoring criteria and feedback should also be published. The scoring criteria and the feedback should explain how the correct response will be evaluated", "answer": "C: desk"}

If you look at the fraction, there is a five over the line of the fraction, so you have 238/10. We are going to convert this to fractions of ten, by dividing each part by 10. When you do this is going to equal one twenty-eight over one hundred. This is going to create a 128 over one hundred, which is going to create the fraction 238/ 10. When this is equal to the fraction 2.38, or 238 divided by 10.\n\n### Support  : Your answer is one twenty-eight divided by one hundred. After you divide this, it turns into 128 divided by 1,000.

The tent will not be used outdoors, so it does not need to be waterproof. The tent will stay up for at least a year (12 months), which will allow the club to save money on their rent by going to a more economical storage facility. An additional 36 feet of rope will be required to build the tent.  If the tent's frame's cross-section is 7 inches square, can the club afford the tent?\n\n### Rationales:The tent's cross-sectional area, the 7 inch square, is equal to 7*7 = 49 square inches. The rope will support the tent. The entire length of rope will be needed.\nThe tent has a cross-sectional area of 8 feet X 8 feet = 64 square feet. There are 16 square feet in 1 ft**2** = <<16=16>>16 square feet.  There would be 4 feet of rope on each side. If this is correct and the entire area is covered by rope, the amount of pounds of rope needed would be 815 / 2 = <<815/2=407.5>>407.5 pounds or 49 x 407.5 = <<49X407.5=19945>>19945 pounds.\nThe tent's frame has a cross-section of 7 inches square.\nLet's assume that the frame is 80 in square.\nThere are 8 in in 1 ft**3** = <<8 in in 1 foot3=1 in>>1 in\nAnother frame has a cross-2 section of 4 in square.

Since it is an odd number means x and 4 are also even. So we can deduce that x is even and 4 is even and x+4 is even. So two numbers are even means even.

{"text": "Input: Where would a human expect to see manufacturing operations?\n\n### Demand Solution:\nIn this case the correct answer is C: grocery stores.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### Option C\n\n-\tWhen you take a trip to get groceries, you\u2019re likely to see people in aisles picking up food. And as soon as you\u2019re finished and leave the store, you are in many ways using a product made through some sorts of manufacturing: as grocery store products like canned soup and frozen ice cream involve many processes to produce (cleaning, cooking, freezing, canning), a person would consider grocery store a spot for manufacturing.\n\n#### Option D\n\n-\tMost aircraft are made on assembly lines, but the process requires specialized assembly, including welding, which does not fit human expectations for manufacturing.\n-\tAn aircraft requires significant specialized manufacturing processes, so one would not consider this a manufacturing process in a grocery store.\n-\tMany aircraft are built in factories, but this is clearly the exception. The answer to the question of where a human would expect to find manufacturing is an on-going activity with a product that a human can identify and interact with. The aircraft would have to be made by people who either have an unusual amount of spare time or some sort of unusual, almost industrial, assembly.\n\n#### Option A\n\n-\tFactories. Factories are buildings where things are made. These buildings are large and often produce different types of things. People work in factories and produce things.\n\n#### Option B\n\n-\tSchools. The classroom is a place where we teach and create knowledge. This is the perfect location for people to learn and create. You could think of it as a factory where knowledge is being created!\n\n#### Option E\n\n-\tIn most schools, there is a cafeteria that offers meals and snacks.

They had one horse and had to cross the river.  They had two wagons  one full of soda bottles  the other full of beer bottles. The man tells the boy that he can either take the beer wagon and drown the horse in the river, or he can take the soda wagon. The boy takes a deep breath and chooses to take the soda wag on the man asks he if he didn't take beer wagon and he said yes, the man said \"I thought so, I would have chosen that too!\"\n\n### Rationales: A man and a boy travelled down a mountain path on a horse, and had to cross the stream to transport the two wagons. The boy has the choice of taking his horse off him, which means that he would be alone on a horse, and then take the soda waggon and put the horse on it, or take the beer waggon and drown the horse to cross the river. I assumed the boy would not be able to cross the river on horseback due to that scenario, and the person telling him to drown the horse was the boy's father, since it is just the boy and his father on a horse. I asked how many horses were on the horse, and since the one person who told the boy to drown the one horse was his father (since it was just his father on the horse), that meant there was only one horse.\n\n#### Rationales:\nFirstly, this one took me the longest to do, since when I saw it initially, I had to do a lot of calculating and math, and I thought I was wrong and thought what I had come up with had to be wrong.

Choices: C: eat carrots D: lay eggs E: be a carrot D's mother will have? Choices: C) a rabbit\n\n### Response and justification:\n\nThe word _carrots_ can refer to several things. The word _lay_ indicates the meaning of a word is figurative, so it's referring to some kind of _laying_. Given what we know so far, a chicken or other land animal cannot lay eggs in an animal. Therefore, the correct response is choice D, _Be a carrot_. The final piece of information provides us with the context of the problem and tells us what the rabbit's mother will be.

The number of columns of the data set were five, hence, we will have two arrays as the training set has the size of two. This is because one of the variables of the data train is train_Y. Since, X is an array, and Y is the number of train, one variable cannot be trained in the logistic. Hence, we decided to split them into two separate sets. But, only, one is trained. In other words, we will use the training set to train the logistic, and then check on the testing set by using the test set X to test the logistic trained on the training set X_train.

A pet store is just that - a pet store.  He avoids pet stores.\n\n### Choices: B: parking lot\n\nRationales: Parking lot\nWhile we do not know how and why we can infer from the statement that he loves animals and hated animal abuse that this person is the sort who avoids public places where animals might be mistreated.  A parking lot is filled with potholes and ditches.  Animals in the parking lot will be at risk from cars or being hit by people so John will avoid places like parking lots.\n\n### choices: C: woodland (forest?)\nRationales: Since John avoids public places where there is a high risk of animal abuse.

Parks are usually well established and where there is much more community involvement than most public spaces.\n\n### Answer:\nChoice: A\n\n\n### Input and Demonstration:  Three more than twice as many dollars as 500\n\n### Rationales:\n3 more than twice as many =  3*(2*500) = 3*1000\nTwo as many more dollars as 50 means twice as many as 50, which equals 100 so the final answer would be 3*10.  The original expression \"two more than twice as many\" means two times 2.  When two of a number is added to it, it equals the next number in sequence.  So twice as many is 1 more than twice as many.\n\n### Output:Two times as many as", "answer": "A: pet store"}

Since the lowest grade is in the group, so if the group contain 1 boy and 3 girls, the lowest grade is contained by three girls while one boys have lower grades, therefore, this group is not the best group to choose\n2. Since the lowest grade in the group, so there should be a pair of friends who has lower grades, and therefore a pair of friends is required too, then the boy should join a girl, and therefore in group B, the lowest grade is two girls and one boy with the lowest grades\n3. Since the lowest grades in group A is 1 boy and 2 girls, this pair is not required in group A, as we need to pair up one girl with 2 boys, therefore the group you want is A\n\n4.

{"text": "Answer: A, B or both are wrong\n\n### Rationale:\nCivil action is the action of one or more persons initiating legal proceedings against another, without involving the government; such proceedings are also called private lawsuits or private litigation. The two most common types of civil actions are torts and contracts.\n\nInstituting civil action could just involve the process of taking the action and it may cause confusion, hurt feelings or just bad feelings.\n\nHowever, from the question, the choice of sandwiches is implying that an instance of instituting civil actions could cause good feelings, but that is not the case as we see with civil actions.\n\n#### 86: What is the result of instituing civil action?\nAnswer: D, bad feelings and confussion, not sandwhiches\n\n### Instrucion:\n\n### Input\nInput: The number of dogs and cats in the neighborhood is 286, plus the number of dogs and caterpillars. The number of dogs in the neighborhood is 130% of the caterpillars, which is at least 50% more than 15. What are those numbers?\nRationale: The number of dogs is 130 * <<15= 130*20=260>>260, and the number of caterpillars is 15.\nThe number is 260 plus the number of dogs which is 260+130 = <<260+15=175>>175.\nSince 286 is greater than 175, the number of dogs and caters are 130 and 15.\n\nInput: Aaron is the father of 4 children.

There might be many situations in which you can first read books or turn on TV. For example, to make a cup of coffee first or to set up your computer, first turn on your computer. You might consider both reading books and turn on TV or you might consider turn on TV first because you'd like to watch TV as soon as possible, and then read books.\n\n### Your answer for the second question depends on your preference, and, there can be many situations. Therefore you have to make a choice. Although turning on TV takes less time than reading books, I'd recommend you to read books first instead of turning on TV. It takes more time to finish a cup of coffee. For example, if I don't have my favorite mug, I might first turn on my TV, because I'd like to watch as soon as possible.

The rides at Disneyland aren't movable. We can rent an opera, but people won't celebrate by doing so. We're going to use the carousel as our example for our answer, because the carnival rides and the rides at Disneyland are more broad categories.  We'll pretend the carnival is just a bunch of traveling carnival workers, and we'll replace the carnivals with the idea of a traveling carnival.\n\nThe choices are:\n  * A: People might ride r ate rides at a state par the carousel and carnival workers will ride at carnivals. The carnivals are traveling carnival will move from one  place to the next. \n  * B: People might go to an opera. The opera can't be r ented. People won't celebrate a birthday by going to a carnival, and carnivalse are not celebrations. Carnivals are temporary places, and the places we celebrate have to be permanent. We can not own an opera. \n  * C: People might go to Disneyland.  We can rent an opera. The carnival rides are more broad categories than a state park, and no one celebrates by going anywhere at Disneyland. Disneyland doesn't provide rides, a state park does.

Write a response that correctly completes the statement that is missing a word.\n\n### The CIA estimates that the number of nuclear weapons in the world is somewhere between five and twenty thousand, depending on which estimates you choose. A recent government report stated that at least four thousand of these weapons are \"nonstrategic,\" meaning that they could be used as explosives for building or destroying things. For years, these weapons have been the subject of major disagreement between governments because they are particularly suited to terrorists and criminals and yet it is not clear how to get rid of them.\n\n### When it became clear during the fall that the Soviet Union and the United States were likely to sign an agreement on nonstrategic nuclear weapons (the NPT that they had been discussing for the past few years), many critics in Washington were dismayed. They hoped that, if the Soviet Union and the U.S. agreed in principle to get rid of all these weapons, they would agree to get rid of both the good ones and the bad ones. But, because the two countries were at such different points in the negotiations, this seemed impossible.\n\n### However, last week this situation changed somewhat. The two countries agreed to a tentative deal, that will include an arrangement for verifying reductions in these weapons. Now, there are only the negotiations of the formal document left and, if they go well, the NPT will be ready for the July 1 signing ceremony by both countries.\n\n### As a result of the agreement, the 150-some nations that are signed onto the NPT can concentrate on making the agreement work. But there are several countries, including Israel, that are not signatories, who fear that once the United States and Soviet Union agree, the other nations might pressure them to join as well. And even the two nations themselves are far from agreeing on specific things-like whether there should be a secret side agreement about destroying biological weapons.\n\n### Verification of weapons reductions remains a big problem. The NPT is likely to include some sort of arrangement for verifying disarmament agreements; for example, inspectors visiting nuclear plants", "answer": "A: accomplish"}

The circle of radius r has circumference C, and the circle of radius r/2 has smaller radius r/2 and is inside the radius r, so the sum of both circumferences is c(r-r and r/2 = <<c(r-r/2=r>>r/2r).

No fractions or division by 0 allowed.\nOutput: We need some help here to understand the question properly.\nAnyway, here are some explanations to help you better understand the question:\n- The product of a whole number X and a fraction X/Y is the whole number XY.\n- If X = 4, then the product X/Y is 4/4, which is 4/4 or 4/4, same thing right.\n- To work the problem out, we need to convert the fraction so the fraction of the whole number in to fraction of whole, so that the product would be equal to multiply of X, therefore is the same whole number as the fraction of fraction which the product of whole number would be same whole number as fraction which divides by is.\n- Consider that same here, which the 1*3 / is 1/1 as 6, 1*2, if we know that *3 would be 6 and product if the denominator of 3 is the 3.\n- So, the whole number as the fraction which is 1 that 10 and 3 that fraction would be the reciprocal and reciprocal divided by divided 1/4 by X by as a whole number dividing the X by 1/4 the same thing about the same fraction the question same thing about 3 by dividing the product of (X*3 as whole number the reciprocal divided which would be 4 by reci prothe 3 as the same, reciprocal 7/1 of the same 4 so divided as the product is 3/4 divided by the recipro by dividing the division by the product dividing by 3 prothe pro(a dividing by 2/4 as per the same as recipro the division is 6 as dividing 2*as pro, which arerecipro the pro the same as the same as the pro12 for 1 the dividing 2 as the reci is by dividing pro are in 2 anddivide by", "answer": "E: celebrating"}

Let l represent the length and w represent the width for first rectangle.\nSince it is five times longer than it is wide, l = 5*w\nSince width is twice the length:  The width = l = 2w\nSo l and w are 124 and 12 respectively to find l =<<1+1<<12=1+2=6>>6\nSimilarly, w=<<2>>2 (1+12)\nSince w is twice l and w is two times l thus w is l = <<2*l=4*l=8>>4\nAlso, the sum of l and w =<<1*l=24\nSo, the answer is 8\n12+8=<<2+8=10\nSince two rectangle l=10\nSo the final  =10\n\nSo it \nSo the final answer= >>10\n\n\n---\n\nInput: 7x + 6\nOutput:x 6", "answer": "D: big city"}

The sum of all the input values is r. So, for example, to get the amount spent by purchasing 5 oranges, we need to subtract 3 from the total amount of money, and then we get r=5. Next, we look at how each value of R relates to money.\n\nr1 = 5-3 = peach amount (2m+k)\n\nr2 = 0-(2m+k) = apple amount (3a-2m-k)\n\nr3 =", "answer": "C: computer science"}

If Bob has 3 half-gallon bottles of apple juice, how many extra 8 ounce bottles of apple juices do he need if he wants to bottle the juice evenly?\n\n**Output**: **24**\n\nI was able to get the right answer however I was asked to write up the logic and explain the steps I took. Here were my steps.\n\nWe first knew if x is added to a half-gallon apple juice bottle that x should not exceed half the amount of apple juice. This is because the entire purpose of the problem is that you want 2 gallon bottles out of the total amount. If x exceeds one-half the amount of apple juices then you would never be able to fit two full gallons and you would have to discard one-halves, therefore having to use three half gallon bottles and not 2. Therefore the x value is not allowed to exceed x/2.\n\nWe then knew that you would need 3 more extra 8 ounce apple juice bottles to fill the other half of a half gallon bottles. This is because if you fill one half-gallon you will always have a bit left, so therefore you will need one less apple juice filled 8 ounce bottle.\n\nThe problem was asking how many extra 8 oz bottles do you need to fill up one half-gallons bottle, therefore it can be solved as follows:\n\n`x - x/2 + 3 = 2*x/(x/2)`\nx/2 = 1\nx = 2\nx + 3 = 6\n6 = 2\n3 = 3\n\nFinal answer: 2\n\nI would have used the same logic", "answer": "A: water cooler"}

Randy has three bears, the game calls for 1 bear per turn, therefore he is guaranteed to win on all his next three turns. The twins Kevin and Kelley start off with 3 bears together so if no die rolls are modified as in the next rule no player can win and each turn only results into a tie. The dice is a six-sided die of six different outcomes on each side such that two of the sides has 3 equal numbers as shown and is used 1 time on every turn to determine player order and bear number to take. Choose the best response(s) that will cause one of the twins to win\nOutput: Kevin takes the first turn for the first roll, Kevin would choose to do nothing as his turn since he has the most bears but not enough to win but Kelley does nothing and Kelley takes the third turn for the last die roll, so Kelley takes the three bears to win. Kevin and Kelley take alternating turns with Kevin taking the first turn each round and Kelley taking the second turn each round. Kevin and Kelle get both players to get a turn before Randy does. Kevin can never take a bear on a turn if Randy gets a turn before Kelley so Randy must take the last turn each round. Kevin could take a bear on his first turn if he was allowed to do so but he isn\u2019t. For Randy\u2019s first turn every bear is a three, if he takes a normal turn he\u2019d have to move ahead and Kelley would have a bear as would take a turn where Kevin would not be able to take a bear. Kevin would take one of the bears next round if Kelley didn\u2019t choose a bear in the second round but that also means Randy gets to move more each round so Randy still has an advantage each round. Kelley would take", "answer": "E: table"}

The solution is '1'.\n\nThis question asks for the total amount of candies.\n\nI'm going to assume that the input is the only data available. I start with a blank array, with an integer, candies, in the ith element. Since Corey's candies are 8 more than Tapanga's, we know that Tapanga has candies. So, initially, candies = '29'.\n\nNow we're going to get the value of candies for every candies in the array. Because every candies has 8 more candles than the previous one and Freddy starts his calculation without any information about the remaining candies. So we just have to increment all candies by 8.\n\nSince they both call at the same time and that the distance is the same, they took the same amount of time. In this case it doesn't change that the amount of money Freddy spends calling his family on New Years Eve is 69.\n\nIf the family calls Freddy at the same rate, he will see a 10-dimensional matrix (one column for each day) with two rows, one column representing 5, and the other representing 25.\n\n\nFrom the above logic, we know that after donating a certain number of books to the", "answer": "A: apply for job"}

{"idx": 275, "text": "D\n\n## Solution\n\n### Solution: Part1\n\n- In this question, to add 9 to 5 we can directly do '14'. Instead, we add 9 and get '99'. Then use subtraction to subtract 5 to get the answer.\n- In this question as we know the sum of the two numbers to be 7, we can use the code `7` to represent each of these numbers.\n- In this case, we can directly add the two digits to the right. Or else we can subtract 10 and add that at the left.\n- Firstly divide the numerator by 2 and then the denominator by 2.\n\n\n### Solution Part 2\n\n- It will be easier to understand if we understand the 'if' section before diving into the 'then' section.\n- If the number is positive, we will be dividing and if it is negative, we will be multiplying. If it is negative, we take the sign of the second number to be positive and change the sign of the first number to be same.\n- The division process is exactly the same as the multiplication process. Here since we are only dividing for whole numbers, we put the modulus `0` to the result.\n- If we have already subtracted 1 from the second number, we multiply the result by `-1`.\n- In `if` statements, if we have to take the division of one variable to other variable's power, we take the base of the power to be `2`. We can take the base to be `2` and write `pow((-10-base), base)` to be equal to pow(-2, base) as we have been asked.\n\n- Here we are dividing the number to a decimal with some certain precision and we also add the decimal to the result.\n\n- Here the number becomes positive, the first condition is being met. So the output should be 0.\n\n\n## Solution: Part3\n\n- When we are using '2' here we multiply the result by `2` so that we get the original result after multiplying '2' to it.\n\n- Here, from the first condition, it is clear that the result should be an integer.\n\n- To find the sign, we first find the sign of '5' and then we compare if either of them", "answer": "B: happiness"}

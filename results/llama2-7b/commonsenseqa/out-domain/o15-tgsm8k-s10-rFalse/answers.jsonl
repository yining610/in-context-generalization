Notice that the recursion works using the method recurDivisors to generate the multiple divisors (the input parameter to recurDivisors is a pointer to the current divisor in recursive calls).\nThe function recurDivisors() uses recursion and a base case (for example n=1) to generate all the divisors.\nThe return statements in the recursive calls are used to exit the recursion at specific divisors (in this case 10 is the target divisor) where the sum is equal to the sum from the base case.\nReturn statements in the function recurDivisor call the function recurDivisions(n - divisor) and this calls the base case where the next divisor is added to the array.\n\nNotice that the recursive calls recurDivisor() will reassign the n input parameter to the original parameter (i.e. recurDivisor uses the n parameter that the function was called with while the recurDivisions() uses the n-divisor recurDivisor just passed to it.

Fortunately, he learned in math class that if you want to convert ounces to cups, you can simply multiply the number of ounces by 8. So he multiplied the number of ouncers of flour that were needed for the recipe by 8, and found out how many cups he needed. Later in his math class, John learned that if you want to know approximately how heavy something is, you can multiply the number of pounds by 2.5 to find out what the approximate value in kilograms will be. Therefore, John used the number that he had in kilograms to convert the number of ouns in flour to what the number would be if converted into pounds. He then used his new number to determine how much the total flour needed for the picnic muffins would weigh. He multiplied the ounces needed for the muffins by 8 and then found out how many kilograms it would be after it was converted to pounds.

In other words, 3000 is saved, but in 6 months will be enough money after the first two payments, and will be used to buy a house\n\nInput: A local supermarket offers shoppers the option of signing up for an extra 10% off their purchase.

{"text": "D\n\n### Solution:\n\nIn the solution file, we wrote a series of Python code that takes the input and computes the multiple questions answers. We use list, dictionary and functions as shown below:\n\n```\ndef computeAnswers(price, quantity, expPurchaseAnswers):\n    total = 0\n    for a in expPurchaseAnswords\n        total+= a[1]*a[0]\n    return a['total'] + price*quantity\n```\n### Output:\n```\nprint ( \"Answer to Question 1:\", computeAnswers(12, 3.0, {\"12\":2.5}) )\n\nprint ( \"Answer Q2: \", computeAnswers(4, 1.0, {\"4\":{75,\"1\":44,}}) )\n```\n### Reason:\n\nThe first question we split the problem into 2 parts: (i) Compute all possible purchases (ii) Total purchase price\n\nFor part i we split the problem further into parts depending on the input we get, the first case which is when you buy 1 unit only, we will write the code for this case later on. The second part, compute the purchase using two variables, the first variable is the price of the units and the second variable is the units which you need to buy.\n\nFor the total purchases, we need to compute the total by using the purchase dictionary and the input price. Now, we will go back to the first part. If we only buy 1 quantity, the total is the price times 1. So, the first two cases, we can just simply return the amount after we compute them. But if only 12 units are needed, what will be the total cost? In the second question we have two input variables and we are calculating the total cost. Now, let us see if we can apply it in the first question. The quantity is 3, so we know the first 4 possible answers, we can use a dictionary to store it and we will retrieve and add to the total only the needed price. So, we only call the two required inputs for the 12 and the 2.5, and we store the remaining three options in a list.\n\nSo, the first part of this question could be the following:\n\n```\nanswers = {'12':", "answer": "B: grocery cart"}

The minimum chance that you get exactly 2 balls of the same color is: \nOutput: 0.547\n### Solutions:\n\nMultiple Choice 1\n\nTo answer this question, the buyer should firstly convert the weights.\n\nWe are given that one kilogram of the dried fruit costs $5, let us say the dried fruit costs 5 units, then one kilogram costs 5 units.\n\nWe are further told that one kilogram of nuts cost $12, which costs 12 units.\n\nWe can see that the numbering is not the same, the key is to subtract to get the conversion. From above, we are told that one kilo of nuts costs 12 units, the same as the nuts cost 12 units. Therefore, one kilo of dried fruit costs 12 units \u2212 12 units, so we can read that 1 kilo of dried fruits cost 1 unit.\n\nSo now, we should just sum up the numbers. For the dried fruit, 5 units multiplied by 1 unit is 5 units, while for the nuts, the answer is 1 times 3, which equals 3.\n\nSo, the answer is 36 because of the number 36, we can see 36. If we subtract the number 36 by 1, the answer will be 16.\n\nMultiple Choices 2\n\nThis is a simple substitution of multiplication with division to make it as an integer. After multiplying the two fractions, we see that the product is 42. After we divided it by 3, we got the answer, 14.\n\nMultiple choice 3\n\nI would like to explain a bit to get the answer. The two numbers that we are allowed to use are 5, 7, 2, 7, 1, and the output is 300.\n\nSuppose we choose five, so in the truck, there are 5 stones of blocks, then in the stack, which is 6000, will be five times the amount of blocks, in which five times 6000 is 300", "answer": "D: parking lot"}

It is like defining what a particular object looks like, in some sense, the way some object class look like all other objects.\n\nA class in computer programming defines what a particular object looks, what properties and functions(methods) it has and can perform.\n\nAn abstract class is a class without an implementation, an incomplete class. A subclass inherits the methods. A program should have an abstraction of what the subclasses should inherit and what the subclasses should implement.\n\n### Instructions: Answer the question on the right \n\nMost programming languages do not have any special syntax to define a class. The definition of a class is usually called a class declaration or class specification.\n\nThe class specification should state the _name_(identifying string or ID) of the class, its _base class_. Any inherited functions and methods (or methods inherited from its base class) must be implemented by the _subclasses_. The function and methods may also be defined within the class specification, as well\n\nAn abstract class inherits from another class and extends its operations", "answer": "C: play tag"}

Light a fire using twigs, leaves, paper and/or sticks  E. Blow on a match to start a fire with dry kindling\n### Response : I think that the best answer is E.\n\n### Reason for answer: The options given are (A) Lay a fire for twenty minutes with dry kindling, no wind and (B) put kindling, leaves and stick in a pile using propane torch to start the fire. So by these option I found out that both option use kindling and propane torch for starting fire. I do not think that option (A) can work as it cannot take the fire for 20 min with no wind because fire needs some kind of wind to spread the fire. And when wind blows from side the fire cannot spread. And if you use propane torch to ignite dry kindling then it will spread automatically. If we take option (D), it will only light fire with twigs or sticks because by options the twig is not in there but stick. To know that option (D) is correct we need some experiment to prove that twig or stick can keep fire for long time. By the option C, we need fire wood.

So by solving that equation I get: $500 = $<<500>>5000\nSo the sister needs  $\\frac {500}{5000} = <<\\frac{500}{5,000}=0.1]]0.1 = 10%\n\nThen I will tell how much money her brother needs to start the business. We know that it is enough to start the business and it doubles every year so $ <<...>>X = $ <<...>>X + X = $ <<...>>1 + X = $ <<\\left(\\frac{X}{\\left(\\frac{X}{2", "answer": "D: contentment"}

However, if we apply a bit of reasoning, we can come up with an answer, and then provide a rational answer. The key to solving this type of a problem is to find either a rule or pattern (if there is one) that can apply to the missing information, which will either (Animal and information provided, or Animal and no information given). Then, we choose an answer based on the rule or pattern.\n\nBased on the question, I assume that this is meant to be asking where a real animal is likely to be caught (not in England, maybe?). The other answers (Tennessee, grassy field, or forrest) all have a ton of detail about where something might be or not be caught. The information in England feels like a \"maybe\" answer that would go with either option. So, with the data (animal, and possibly animal and no data) we have two options for the question: either and either, so based on that, answer is C or D as they include either the animal or no data about it. So the answer would be C  or D. So the rational answer would be along the lines of \"the animal could be [Option C or D, and based on the data, animal is probably B and that data is missing]\"\n\n#### C \n\nAnswer: Grassy field\n\nor\n\nD\n\n#### D\n\nAnswer: England\n\n\n### Instuction:Input:Which is greater, 72% or 93%?\nOutput: Greater is 93% because there are 100 more percentages in 93% than there are in 72%.\n\nRationales:72% is 72/100 because % is decimal, and there are 10 units in 1%, 10 x 1/10 = 10/10 so 100 is 10/1.\n93% is not 93/1.\nIn order to make 100", "answer": "C: grassy field"}

Rather than inspire the children he has to be more patient and deal with the kids when they misbehave. A patient teacher must be resilient and deal with the hard stuff first. Then you have the happy moments where your hard-work pays off. The most important thing in teaching kids is time. Your children may make you feel you have little of this commodity, but your children are learning all the time. Everyday is another step to becoming an adult. Teaching will not always be easy but you will get better at it. It is important to take all children seriously and not make fun of others just because they are different. You will not be like their parents, they may not always listen or they may try your patience at times. This is when you must become patient and use your inspiration to get them on the right track.

This could be considered as an exercise.\n\n### Input\nWhat is the average rate of change in the above graph?\n\n### Response\nB\n\n### Rationales:\nTo find the average rate of change, we need to solve this problem as a slope. We can see that our graph is changing very quickly but it is not increasing every unit but rather jumping around. The slope should include the two points at either extreme so you are dividing your total rise over the total run of the graph, which is two 3\u2019s. The slope could be found by using the formula y = mx + b, and in this case, y = rate of change. This would give you two values, one for the beginning end of the graph (the rise divided by the run is 2/5=.4) and one for the end of the graph (divide 3 by 2 for a total of 1.5) so m =.4 which is the average change in the rate of change. To find the b (y-intercept) just take.4 and multiply by zero which gives you.4. You have now found out that the slope is.4 and the y-intercept is zero (0).\n\n### Input \nJamie drove with her mom down to the coast. They stayed 4 days and 3 nights.

(The place value of the digit is found with the answer of a place value question for each place position.) For example, we need to ask the question of how many 1s there are for the tens place, how many 1s for the hundreds place, how many 0s for the thousands place, how many 9s for the place ten thousand, and so on.\n\n\n#### Ex. A:\nThe tens place is 39 or 039\nThe hundreds place is 24 or 024\nThe thousands place is __6__ or __6__\nThe place ten thousand is __3__\nThe place hundred thousand is __2__\nThe place million is __4__\n\nAs we can see, the digits at each position are the same. The digits at each place value position are the same.\nHence, the answer is __4___ because __4___ copies of every number at every place value position.\n\n* If we have the answer from the question and the answer to the place value at the same place value position, we can simply multiply the value from the answer to the place where we have questioned.

{"text": "The answer is C (insult)\n\n### Rationale:Insensitive, perhaps, but, technically: (1) the leavee is not leaving, but rather (2) the leaver is leaving. It is the leaver who will be waving goodbye to the leavee, who is also staying. If a person is actually leaving for good, he should not expect any insults, as that will be an act of unfriendliness.\nIf a person is a leavee (that is, he is staying), it is rude to insult the leaver. Insulting someone who is not leaving does not make any sense, as that person is not leaving. That is, that person remains the same, whatever he does. It also happens to be one of the meanings of \"non-moving\", a word which means the same as \"standing\", from a verb which can be translated as \"to remain\". The person remains the same despite taking any actions, and the actions do not make him into a leavee.\nMore specifically, it is the leaver who is leaving (not the leavee). Therefore, it is an insult toward someone who is leaving, while the leaver remains.\nWe can also see that this is the only answer that does not use either the word \"goodbye\" or something that means \"go away\". The leaver is not meant to leave, but this answer does ask that he at least try to leave. It also contains insults, such as \"effing dunce\" and \"f***ing b******\", which are common insults.\nOn the other hand, if you are insulting someone whom you do not intend to insult (or rather, whom you are not even expecting to insult, or is not even planning to expect to insult), then this is just insular communication, or \"speech about nothing\", and is meaningless (because no one really cares about insults directed at people who are not really or actually present) and should be ignored.\n\n#### 1000\nAnswer: C: attempt suicide\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration: The answer is E\n\n### Rationales: \"They will probably all get arrested\" is a good reason, but the correct version is also: \"They are", "answer": "B: wave goodbye"}

Since you cannot pass less than 14 questions, these 25 questions are the 14-plus-4-multiple-choosing-to-have-no-fewer-than-14-possible.\n  - Then, \u201cThe number of questions can be at a multiple of 4\u201d, we can say that each set of 4 questions is worth 1/4 of the test.\n  - Now, each set of 4 contains 25% of that set not passing (since the class failed 25%). So, you must make each set of 4 worth enough that 25% of it passes. \u201cAfter answering the questions\u201d, 18% of the 25% class failed, which is.18 *.25 = <<.18*(.25)=.0475>>4.75% of the class would fail a set of 4 questions.\n  - This means that each set of 8 questions must work out to make up for 4 of those 4.75% failing.\n\n  - \u201cThe number of questions is 16+4.16+4=20.\u201d\n  - 16=4*4.\n\n  - However, 47.5% would not pass the 4 questions given per set, so 20/4.75 \u2248 4.16.

If the cat-dog got you or, the bobcat got you, it's natural to say, got you again as in the previous instances, where the word 'got' implies that the 2nd sentence is continued directly from the previous sentence.\n\nIf the dog got you in the previous sentence, then the next sentence is most likely to be 'The bobcat got me!'.\n\nThe dog after being mistaken for bobcat' is most likely to be uttered in the second scenario when the dog is really scared at the bobcat! \n\nThe dog after been scared by the babcat is the one that is mentioned in the text and this is the one that has been repeated by a lot of readers. It's completely wrong!!\n\nHad the answer been, got you again in the previous sentence, the word 'again' wouldn't have had been mentioned in the next sentence. Then the cat-dog doesn't know which 2nd sentence is it", "answer": "E: front door"}

The total cost would be 3.50 + 1.75 = <<3.50+1.75=5.25>>5.25. If the cost is 5.25 and you subtract.03, 525 -.03 = <<525-(.03)=522>>522. So the candy and milk were.03 cheaper than the previous total.\n\n### Rationale : \nThe candy and milk were 5.25 -.05 = <<5.25-(.05)=5.20>>5.20. So the candy was.05 cheaper than the first total and the milk was 5.25 +.05 = << 5.25+(.05)=52.5>>52.5. So the milk was.5 cheaper to the first total.", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Rationale:  The question asks where a binder contains homework assignments.  We could find it in a backpack, but backpacks typically contain items that we wear while in class or outside.  The items found in bookshelves are not typically homework assignments or materials used for school assignments or projects.  Therefore, the binder would not be found in a bookshelf.  Similarly, neither an office supply store or a classroom would contain assignments that are completed in class.  The items sold in office supply stores and items that are completed in the classroom are not school assignments and would not typically be put inside a binder.  Therefore, neither an office supply stores nor a classroom would be the location to find a binder containing school assignments.\n\n### Input 2: The cost of dinner for 10 people is $240. After  the bill is paid and a tip is added, each person pays $20. How much did the tip cost?\n\n### Rationales:  After all of the people were billed for dinner, the amount was paid for along with a tip of $20.  Therefore, $240 + $20 = <<240+20=260>>260 was paid for the meal (eaten by 10 people).  Because the meal was $260 and the bill was already paid by the amount shown, the tip added to the bill made up the $260.\n\n### Question 3:\n\n### Question: How many bags of chips does Brianna need to buy for her 16-person party if she spends $25 on each?\n\n### Answer: 14\n\n### Rationel:  Brianna has to consider 8 bags for 8 guests, 2 bags for 3 guests, and 4 bags for 5 guests.  Therefore, she needs 12 + 4 + 2 = <<12+4+2=18>>16 bags to accommodate all of the guests at a combined total of 16 guests and their bags.

They want to give free food which is roughly equivalent to his monthly purchases for a few months, but not so much that they can easily make so much more revenue.  How much money should they give if they want to keep this deal?\nRationales Answer:  The restaurant should give enough free food in a given month to make him feel happy, but not so much as to make him unable to spend it in a month. In other words, the restaurant will give him enough food so that 1 + $1500 * (1 -.5) = <<1+1500*(.5)=2500>>2500 is more than the $2000. Remember, we are looking for a number that makes it so they can make $3000.\n$3000 - $2500 = <<3,000-2,500=500>>500 dollars profit.\n#### 500\nAnswer: 500", "answer": "E: food poisoning"}
{"text": "Correctly complete the request.\n\n#### Answer:C\n\n### Rationale: Choice A: Living does not describe what to do to enjoy the fresh air more.\n\n### Choice B: Feeling good does not accurately describe what to do to feel better while breathing fresh air.\n\n### Because option C does accurately describe what to feel how to feel better while breath.\n\n### It includes the term 'hyperventilate' and the action hyperventilate describes how one would inhale  and exhale very quickly.\n\n### Option C includes the term 'breathe deeply', which is inaccurately described for how a person should feel good when breathing fresh air.  Because the word 'deeply' is not described accurately to how one should feel, the word 'deeply is removed from the sentence.  In this step, the word deep describes the depth of how one inhales and exhales, thus making the answer E.\n\n### Correct answer is D\n\n### Demostration:\nD is the only answer option that contains the word breathe correctly and the answer is not given.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### A. The definition of living is living in a place. This choice does not fit into the question at all.\n\n### B. Feeling good is not a term describing breathing better.\n\n### C. This term describes how fast one inhales and how fast one exhales. This phrase does not give the correct response to the question, therefore, removing the phrase 'hyperventilate and adding an auxiliary verb such as 'have the desire to hyperventilate'.\n```\nA: Living B: feeling good\nC: hyperventilate\n```\n```\nD: breathe deeply  E: Inhale, exhale very quickly \n```\n\n### D. The definition of breathe is to take air into the lungs and give off carbon dioxide.\nThis term correctly describes the definition of breathing, therefore, including the verb breathe after the auxiliary verb 'to do' is correct.\n\n### The word deeply states the depth of how much air is inhaled and exhaled while breathing, it is to describe the depth and not how one feels about breathing", "answer": "E: breathe deeply"}

If the plane only lands in London for refueling every 15 hours, how many stops does the plane make on the journey?\n\n### Instrumental Variables:\nInstrumental variables are mathematical constructs or estimates that represent an unknown quantity or relationship about a population. They are used to help with a situation where you have not access to the value that you want to determine. \n\nThis situation may be explained using a hypothetical example. Let\u2019s suppose an employer would like to determine the salary of his employees according to their length of experience. He would need to ask his employees to provide personal information. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, he may lose employees, if they declined. \n\nTo solve this problem, the employer may not want to use age or job tenures as an instrument variable. The reason is that if the employer did not disclose all of his employees, he would know certain employees did not reveal their tenures. To make the problem clear, let\u2019s suppose an employee does not inform the employer about his job tenure, if his salary is more than other tenures. \n\nIn this case, the employer does not possess the instrument variable that describes job tenures. However, by adding more employees in the company, he would eventually learn their job tenures and could then estimate the job tenures of the employees not in his company. He can also get this estimate using the instrument variable of job tenure. This information will allow him to determine job tenures without using the sensitive information.", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Julia was 32 in 40 years and she will be 33 in 46 years. Alyssa was 26 years old in 40 years.  Her age is 32 in 36 years. Subtract 32 from 136 = -104.

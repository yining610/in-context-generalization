The time waiting for food can\u2019t be negative, but the wait time can go below zero if someone leaves before the food arrives.

Then if 2 people or group come in the wait time will be 2 x 5 = <<2x5=10>>5 minutes. If we assume that more people come in, the wait time will increase by 2 every time a new group comes in. So using the method we developed in class the  wait time will be 5+(2+2+2)= 5+(4+2)= <<5+4+2=11>>11 minutes.

He\u2019s getting a haircut at the barbershop. If he will be getting charged $0.50 per inch of hair length, for length greater than 4 inches, what amount will he pay?\nOutput: Mike is getting a haircut so this means he will pay the barber. The question states that if his hair is above 4 inches then he will be charged for every inch. The formula to calculate how much he will pay is to add $0.50 + $0 for every inch. Therefore, any inch that is longer than 4 inches will receive a charge of $0.50.\nSince Mike is getting a hairdo at the barber shop he should get charged. So Mike will have to pay the $0.50 for every inch that exceeds 4 inches. The formula which will help the user calculate this is length = inch x $\nSince the barber adds the $0.5 for each inch above 4 inches, the user multiplies his length with $0.5 to get his total cost.\nSo for an inch above 4 the amount = $0.5\nWhen the total inch exceeds 4:\namount = $0.5 + $0.5 +$0.5 + 0.5+...\namount = $0+ $0.5 +0.5 +........................ = $0.5x# of inch(>> 4+ 2+ 0 + 1 + 0+.... = $0.55(\nMike should pay his barber $0.55\nSo the final answer should be $0.55.\n\nInput:Which combination of letter is missing from the sentence below?\n\nThe boss is bossy.\n\nOutput: If we look at the first word of the sentence it says \u201dThe boss is\u201d which is a combination of the letters.\nThe boss is missing the letter \u201ds\u201d and therefore will replace it with its first letter.

This answer is probably incorrect, because it's implying the wind is moving in the same direction for a long time\nC: blowing hard -> Blowing hard could be a description for the wind's movement as well, since we would describe someone's blowing hair as it blows hard.

No, the wind doesn't change directions like something turns into something else, it still just moves forward like a constant wind of some sort.

If dogs are more than twice as common as cats at pet shows, in how many pet shows does a cat appear?\nOutput: If there are 5 cats, then 1/5 are cats or 20%. So let's say there are 30 pet shows and there are 12 cats. The average is 12/30 = <<12/30=0.4====4=25%\nDogs are twice as common so for each dog there needs to be 2 cats which is 16.

So starting off with 5 days left, the father will give his son either money or toy. So he could either give $10 or a toy on the 8th day. He then doesn't give $10 nor a toy until the next even numbered day. So he gives money on the 13th day and a toy on the next even numbered date = 16th day.

Solve the question using the formula or property that describes the answer.\n\n# The average of a set of number is given. However, each number in the list is a multiple of 3. What is the median of the set?\n\n\nOutput: We start by getting the list of numbers in the set so we can get the median and the mean, and we get the median by splitting the numbers into two sets.\n\nThe original set of numbers is 5, 15, 25.\nFirst, we get the following set of numbers:\n\n\n\n```\nSet [ 5, 10, 15,20,25 ]\n```\n\nThen divide it into two sets:\n\n\n```\n1) 5, 11, 15 2) 10, 20, 25\n```\n\nThen to get the median we set each set of number according to this rule and get the middle number:\n\n\n```python\nA[a]==5\n0<A<10\n```\n\nSo the median for the first set is 11.\n\n\n```python \nA[b]==10\n0<A<20\n```\n\nThe middle value is 15.\n\nTherefore, the median for set of numbers is the median of both first and second sets. That means we take the median of 11 and 15, which is 12.5 in decimal and 13 in a whole number.\n\nTherefore the median for the set of numbers is 13.\n\n### Instructions", "answer": "D: light fire"}

Finally, the verb mediate includes the base form (base) mediate not the present participle, so we take run out of steam to base out of steam. Because exhaustion implies no energy, energy must become its base form energy.

She has $100 to her name. At what other price should she look?\nOutput: First think about what items Anika can afford on her $100. She can\u2019t afford the original $40 price. Since she has $100 and the boots are $40, then the boots exceed her budget.  When the original $40 boots exceed her budget, she can\u2019t purchase those boots because there aren\u2019t any other prices of 30 boots that she can afford.\nIf Anika finds a pair of $30 boots, then she can buy them. Anika\u2019s budget is $100 and her budget exceeds the price of two $30 items. Since the boots exceed her $100 budget, she can afford an extra $30. Since her total budget is $10, she can also afford two $30 boots.\nSo the final options are to choose the $30.", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

{"text": "E: optional  In a mandatory evacuation order, the government or local authorities make it required for everyone to leave the area. An evacuation does not happen unless there has been an order mandating all or certain parts of the area to evacuate. The word \u201cmandatory\u201d refers to a person or people being required to do something rather than being given an option to do it. Mandatory means necessary or required \u2013 obligatory, inevitable.\nThe word \u201cmandate\u201d refers to a political or political office given by a legislature for someone to take control, make political decisions or give a particular task to the person. A mandate is a commission by members of a legislature or executive body to an individual to execute a certain task.\nThe word \u201celective\u201d refers to the power to choose which candidate will fill a position in an election.

Let's not use a dictionary since dictionary have words in it, which is not a 4-letter word. 1. So we have to make our own dictionary. So we must start checking a string \"Words\" in our dictionary, since the words might contain \"Words\", \"Swords\", \"words\", \"word\", etc.. So it takes time. And we cannot make all 4 character words in the set. 1. So what we can make is to make a dictionary of <<4-letter words>> that we had searched before, and not make new word that were not in our dictionary. 1. And in our set of words, we will find all the ways to combine the 4 letter words from 3-letter words, to 1-letter words, since we have searched all our words before. 1. So let's see if it works on this set of words:>> The answer is \"Walk\" since it is also a 4-letter words without", "answer": "B: woods"}

Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 999/999 to cancel out 2 x 99s.\n\nMultiply both the numeratior and the denominator by the reciprocal of 999 to get 1 x 999 = <<1/99", "answer": "E: row boat"}

She needs 20 blocks for the top row and 35 blocks for the second row. After setting her blocks up, she finds that the second row contains 2 odd blocks. How many blocks are in her tower?\nOutput: We start by solving for b which is 2x + 2y = 79, which b = ((2x + 2 * 2y) / 79) = <<2x+2*(2y)/79=b>>b. So b is 22, and x is not a whole number therefore b-2 is going to be 0 or 1 and b is 22 therefore there are 22 blocks in the first row.\nOn the second row we have to find all possible number of blocks, so there is 35-2 which is 33, there are 33 blocks, then subtract 1(surely we can't have an odd number of blocks). So one block was 34, meaning the second row is 33 blocks.\nThus, we have 22 blocks in first row, and 33 blocks in the second row, which is 55 blocks in the tower.\nSo the final answers are 22, 33, and 55", "answer": "A: trunk"}

So how many people can come to the party?\nOutput: The only possibilities are 2 guys, 5 guys or 5 girls. Hence the answer has an odd number of girls, so there can only be an odd number of girls\nIf there were 2 guys, than the total number of people coming has to be even, as if it was not even, then there would be at least 2 guys and 2 girls. But that is not true. So we can't have 2 guys.\nSo let's start with 5 guys, but then if there were 5 girls, than the total number would be odd and we'd end up with 4 girls and 5 guys, which is still even. Hence there can't be 5 girls either.\nSo a party, we can have only a 1-1 ratio of males to females, i.e. males=odd number of girls. So we'll just assume that males = odd number of girls. For convenience, let odd number of girls = <<1stguy>>2.\nIf there were 1stguy + 2ndguy - girl1 then the total number of people comes to be even, which is a contradiction, which is true, so it can't happen.\nHence if 1stguy is odd then 2ndguy = <<2ndguy>>3 is also odd (because males=odd number of girl1). So the total number becomes even and there is female, which is a contradiction to 1stguy being odd. So 1stguy can't be even and the final answer is 2.\n\nInput: A store that s", "answer": "A: sit"}

You want to be sure that the group picks a president.  In order to accomplish your goal, you need a special process.    Choose the one process for choosing the President that you must have to guarantee that a group of X members always selects one person to function as its president.\nOutput: To guarantee that a group of  X members always selects one president, two elections are necessary.  Let's call the first election, the nomination election.  Each member of the group nominates one individual, X or less.  (A member of the group may nominate him/herself.)    In the second election, known as the election to elect the president, each member of the group votes for the person he/she nominated as president. If one member nominated him/herself, that person can also be selected president if a majority of the membership of the group votes for him/her.\n\nA majority of members must vote for a person proposed for president in the nomination election for that person to be elected. A simple majority is sufficient in the nomination election.\n(The definition of a majority is the plurality of votes: the person getting the most votes. In an election between three people, the one getting more votes than any other person is the majority.)    If a person is not elected as president in the election to elect the\npresident because of a tie vote, another nomination election is not required. The group can select the person receiving the next highest vote, assuming this person is not the same person nominated in the first election.\nChoice B has all of our necessary steps to guarantee that a group  with X members will always pick a president. The main difference is that in the nomination election step,  B limits each member to nominating a specified number of eligible members, X or less.\n\n1. Which process must you have to guarantee that the group will always select a president?\nA. A majority selection after two election steps.\nB. A majority selection after three election", "answer": "E: falling down"}

Each piece weighs 5.33 gram.\nSo we are now done with 9 pieces and each piece has 5.33 gr per piece.\nWe need to know how many pieces and what\u2019s the weight of each package.\nSo we have the answer of 9 pieces and the weight of each piece is 5.33g.\nSo the next thing we can do is multiply how much cheese by how much piece is needed.\nSince we need 9 equal pieces, hence all of the pieces weighs the same, so the weight is 5.3g/9g = <<5.3g/10=0.53>>0.53g\nSo the amount of cheese in each package is 9 x 0.53=<<9*0.53=4.97>>4.97\nSo the final answer in this part is 4.97\n\nInput: What is the value of the expression: (7 + 2.63*0.93)*1.025/2.6%?\nOutput: We need to simplify the expression.\nSo 7-2.63*<0.93> = <<7-2.6*0.93=-2.18>>-2.18\nThe remaining expression is (7/1.025)-(2.18/", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

It contained a compilation of all sorts of problems that people had to solve in their lives, and in the book, each story was accompanied by a single word that summarized the essence of the story.\nThe word 'never give up' was used to describe any story that described somebody who overcame a seemingly insoluble problem and who learned, through that hard work, to prevail.\nFor example, there was one story in the book about a family who moved into a large, old  house full of cobwebs and rodents, and there were problems of all sorts to overcome.

Is it possible that at the end of the month, my available balance will be greater than $0.10? Explain.\nOutput: A business account has the same balance as it did before. So a $36.1 deposit will decrease the balance by $36 and will increase the remaining balance by $0.10\nIf the account has a balance of $244.10 and a new deposit of $36.00 is added to the account, then the account balance before the deposit plus the new deposit is equal to total 244.00+36.00 + 0.00 which equals $280.00\nNow we subtract the total value of the remaining deposits by the amount we just calculated which equals $28.00\nSo the final answer if Yes.\n\nInput: It took me 3 minutes and 48 seconds to read this.

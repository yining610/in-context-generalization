But the average wait time will be longer if the restaurant is busy. But the actual wait time is the same if only one person is waiting for food at a time. The time waiting for food can’t be negative, but the wait time can go below zero if someone leaves before the food arrives. How many people could be waiting at Chick Fil A before the wait time for everyone goes below zero?<n>Output: For this problem it is important to look at the number of orders and the time that orders take.<n>Assuming that I get an order when I come in, and it takes 5 minutes for me to get my order done. Then if 2 people or group come in the wait time will be 2 x 5 = <<2x5=10>>5 minutes. If we assume that more people come in, the wait time will increase by 2 every time a new group comes in. So using the method we developed in class the  wait time will be 5+(2+2+2)= 5+(4+2)= <<5+4+2=11>>11 minutes. This means that if there are 2 of your group of people we can divide by 11, 2 ÷ (11/2)=11/2=

He’s getting a haircut at the barbershop. If he will be getting charged $0.50 per inch of hair length, for length greater than 4 inches, what amount will he pay?<n>Output: Mike is getting a haircut so this means he will pay the barber. The question states that if his hair is above 4 inches then he will be charged for every inch. The formula to calculate how much he will pay is to add $0.50 + $0 for every inch. Therefore, any inch that is longer than 4 inches will receive a charge of $0.50.<n>Since Mike is getting a hairdo at the barber shop he should get charged. So Mike will have to pay the $0.50 for every inch that exceeds 4 inches. The formula which will help the user calculate this is length = inch x $<n>Since the barber adds the $0.5 for each inch above 4 inches, the user multiplies his length with $0.5 to get his total cost.<n>So for an inch above 4 the amount = $0.5<n>When the total inch exceeds 4:<n>amount = $0.5 + $0.5 +$0.5 + 0.5+...<n>amount = $0+ $0.5 +0.5 +........................ = $0.5x# of inch(>> 4+ 2+ 0 + 1 + 0+.... = $0.55(<n>Mike should pay his barber $0.55<n>So the final answer should be $0.55.<n><n>Input:Which combination of letter is missing from the sentence below?<n><n>The boss is bossy.<n><n>Output: If we look at the first word of the sentence it says ”The boss is” which is a combination of the letters.<n>The boss is missing the letter ”s” and therefore will replace it with its first letter.

When the temperature inside the car rises to 90 degrees, what happens to the temperature outside the car? <n>Output:The question does not explain itself the proper way so i took that into consideration <n>The car with only 3 windows is assumed to be a convertible<n>If the temperature inside the car rose to 90 degrees that means it is hotter than the temperature outside the car.  If the temperature outside the car was 35 degrees then the temperature inside the car has to be 90-35 = <<90-35=55>>55 degrees<n>So the final answer has to be 55 degrees<n><n>Input: "Honestly," said Marlon, "everything's my fault."

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Output: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Where is a monkey likely to be found in the rainforest? Choices:  A: tree tops B: rain forest C: zoological gardens D: great outdoors E: zoo<n>Output:		In a rainforest, there are a lot of trees. A is more likely to be found in a zoo due to how the word great is spelled in part D because it is often associated with animals. Also note that the first line says 'in the rainforest" which may mean within the rainforest.<n>Let us say A has 6 points, B has 4, C has 1, and D & E each have 3.<n>So the final score would be:<n>6 + 4 = <<6+4=10>>1 + 3 + 3 = <<3+3=6>>6<n><n>The final answer thus is 6<n><n>Input: Anita has a set of numbers. She has a few sets of two numbers. She also has a few sets of three numbers.

How many ways can they do this?<n>Output: There is only one answer, and there are four possible choices for the first number. Let us label them  a, b, c, and d.<n>For the second number, one of them could be, say, 2.<n>For the third, there are only 2 possibilities since the second and third numbers must add up to 30.<n>So, for one selection of 30, using the four choices of first numbers:<n><n>(A)(B)(C) would be 1(2)(3): = 6<n><n>(A)(C)(B) would be 10(2)(2): = 20<n><n>(C)(B)(A) would be 3(2)(2):  = 12

Choices:  A: dry hair B: spreading C: blowing hard D: change direction E: wave wheat<n>Output:		Let's see what the choices are and how they are affected:<n>A: dry hair -> Dry hair isn't affected much by the wind, which is why this answer is probably wrong<n>B: spreading -> Spreading is a movement of something along the surface, like the wind spreading out across the surface of the Earth. This answer is probably incorrect, because it's implying the wind is moving in the same direction for a long time<n>C: blowing hard -> Blowing hard could be a description for the wind's movement as well, since we would describe someone's blowing hair as it blows hard. Maybe this one is right though? Blowing is a movement of something that gets stronger in the same direction, so this answer could be right!<n>D: change direction -> Change direction? No, the wind doesn't change directions like something turns into something else, it still just moves forward like a constant wind of some sort. This is probably the wrong answer, as the direction we're describing has to do with the direction the wind blows - not turning into something else.<n>E: wave wheat -> We don't know what "wave wheat" means.. But it feels like it's describing something that's not affected by the wind, so this answer is probably also wrong. And it's not blowing - that's the way we describe something moving in the same direction at different speeds.<n>So, even though C and E are the only two answers we haven't eliminated, the right answer seems to be D - change direction.<n><n>Input:  The weather forecast says you can't go to the beach today, but you'll be able to go tomorrow.

If each one adds up to the maximum amount, then it will fit 8 total. This makes sense, but you can also use the fact that 10 more than 8 is 4; 4: 10 if one is only 4. It only fits if that is subtracted from 40, because if you add those 4 to the total it is over 40>><n><n>Input: How many times can 200 be evenly divided by the numbers 1, 2, and 3?<n>Output: The answer is 5 because they have to divide the whole number in half and if that is a even number then it must be divisible evenly; >>the only time 200 should not be divided evenly is if there is a remainder<<, so you are left with 200 - remainder

If dogs are more than twice as common as cats at pet shows, in how many pet shows does a cat appear?<n>Output: If there are 5 cats, then 1/5 are cats or 20%. So let's say there are 30 pet shows and there are 12 cats. The average is 12/30 = <<12/30=0.4====4=25%<n>Dogs are twice as common so for each dog there needs to be 2 cats which is 16. So the average number of dogs in a pet show = 12/16 = <<12/16=0.75====75%<n>Since there are 2 pet shows for every 1 dog, the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: A father tells his son that he will give him either $10 or a new toy each week, whichever he chooses. The father does not give the boy any money or any toys when there is not an even number of days left in the week. How many days a week is the father giving his son some kind of gift?<n>Output: The father does not give money nor toys if there are not an even number of day left. So starting off with 5 days left, the father will give his son either money or toy. So he could either give $10 or a toy on the 8th day. He then doesn't give $10 nor a toy until the next even numbered day. So he gives money on the 13th day and a toy on the next even numbered date = 16th day. So he has 12 days to give his son toys OR $10. So the final answer is 6<n><n>

Choices:  A: mediate B: have rest C: stay in bed D: run out of steam E: go to sleep<n>Output:		 Mediate means to go out of the way to find a solution, and run out of steam means to use up all of your energy. We take the two sentences one at a time and analyze them individually. We see that run out of steam uses the verb form to steam, the present participle. Mediate also uses the present participle so we take the two and form, 'to run out of steam' and 'to mediate'. Finally, the verb mediate includes the base form (base) mediate not the present participle, so we take run out of steam to base out of steam. Because exhaustion implies no energy, energy must become its base form energy. We replace the verb forms, exhaustion, mediate and run out of steam with the base forms, exhaustion, base out of steam and run out of steam. Now energy can not be used up since the base has become exhaustion and all of the verb forms have been replaced with their base forms. By combining the sentences, we see that the only way to recover from exhaustion is sleep, therefore E.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Output: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:where do you store wine? Choices:  A: attic B: basement C: art show D: church E: bar<n>Output:		A is 'a', so it should be stored in 'attic'.<n><n>Input:where are you now?

Least favorable child: <<>>100 - (8 / number of children).<n>Output: If you were to share the toys equally among 8 children, each child would get 1 toy, and there are no children that would be upset.<n>If you shared the 8 toys equally with 12 children, each child would receive 1 toy, with 2 children receiving 2 toys. And finally, if you were to share the 8 toys among 35 children, each child would then receive 2 toys, with 9 receiving 3 toys.<n>If you can't share the toys equally or are sharing them unequally, you simply divide the number of to in the bag (i.e. 8 in this instance) by the number of children you have (i.e. number of children in the house). In this instance, 8 / 35 = <<8/35=23%>>23%<n>Subtract that from 100 and the final answer is 77.

It can better be described as what? Choices:  A: field B: alone C: small group D: solitude E: solitary<n>Output:		A: field, because the verb "describe" takes a direct object<n>It takes the form "subject + verb + direct object" It isn't possible for it to be "it can better be described as ____" because "____" is the predicate nominative. So it's not option A.<n>It can't be option B either because "alone" (the predicate nominative) refers to the subject "crowd" (the independent clause) and not a verb in the sentence.  So it's not options A or B.<n>It can'т be option C because "small group" isn't an adjective that describes the phrase "it wasn't that big"  The verb of the adjective clause is "wasn't" which is the part that refers back to the subject.  For the subject, "the crowd" refers to the dependent clause, "it wasn't" which is not that big. Therefore it isn't C.<n>So the final choice is E because "solitary" is the predicate nom. that refers to the subject "the crowd" in the sentence "the crowd wasn'т that big" and that crowd couldn't be defined as solitary because it's not a small thing. It couldn't be option E either because "the crowd wasn't that small" would be the sentence if the crowd was small, and you can't define a small thing as solitude or alone.<n><n>Input: What number do you multiple to get 46?<n>Output: 46 x (0)( ) (1).

Let's not use a dictionary since dictionary have words in it, which is not a 4-letter word. 1. So we have to make our own dictionary. So we must start checking a string "Words" in our dictionary, since the words might contain "Words", "Swords", "words", "word", etc.. So it takes time. And we cannot make all 4 character words in the set. 1. So what we can make is to make a dictionary of <<4-letter words>> that we had searched before, and not make new word that were not in our dictionary. 1. And in our set of words, we will find all the ways to combine the 4 letter words from 3-letter words, to 1-letter words, since we have searched all our words before. 1. So let's see if it works on this set of words:>> The answer is "Walk" since it is also a 4-letter words without

Here, our hero and one of his friends take turns jumping from one moving vehicle to another. Each moving vehicle is on a track and it moves forward with a constant speed. If they take turns jumping from the trampoline onto vehicles, the trampoline and vehicles are going at the same speed, their distance from the trampoline does not change. So, they decide not to jump from the trampoline anymore. When you go faster, a distance between consecutive jumps gets bigger. When you slow down to a stop, a distance between consecutive rides on the same vehicle gets bigger as well. On the trampoline, our hero tries to maximize the distance between his rides on the trampoline. They have 1 trampoline, 3 vehicles, and it costs $100 to jump between vehicles. Also, it costs $10 to go from one vehicle to another

Choices:  A: think B: patent C: determined D: work hard E: relax<n>Output:		It is 43+28 = <<43+28=71>>71 years later.<n>Because he will finally see his idea become a reality it has to be 71  - years from now.<n>So the final choice is B<n><n>Input: The population of a kingdom has been falling, so they decide to start having triplets to increase the population. If there were 415 people and 114 people have triplets, how many people are currently alive?<n>Output: Start the problem by looking at how many people have triplets. 114 * 3 = <<114*3=342>>342 Since there are 415 people, you can subtract 415 - 342 = <<415-342=73>>73 people that didn't have triplets.<n>So to figure out how many people are currently living, 73 + 114 = <<73+114=187>>187 Currently living.<n>So the final solution is 187, however, to make it more obvious to the reader you could just say 100% increase.<n>

How much of the store's revenue comes from selling toys to kids, and how much comes from selling to teens?<n>Output: A toy store sells toys to 2 categories of customers: Kids and Teens. We know the  percentage of revenue earned from sales to kids, since that is the question.  So we'll compare revenue from kids to revenue from teens.<n><n>If kids = x/100 + y/100, where:<n>The revenue from kids = x <n>The revenue from teens = y <n>The answer is x/100 = y/100. <n><n>Since the percentage of revenue from the kids is the same percentage of the overall revenue, we will put kids and teens together for revenue in the numerator:<n><n>Revenue from both kids and teens = x/101/100 + x/100/(100-101)/100 = <<x/101/4*101+(x/100)/4*99/4>><n><n>Rewrite 101/(101-100) as << (1+11/101)/11>>.  The 101 disappears after you multiply 100 by 99.  So the equation is x/99.99 + x/(1-101)/99.99.  Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 999/999 to cancel out 2 x 99s.<n><n>Multiply both the numeratior and the denominator by the reciprocal of 999 to get 1 x 999 = <<1/99

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Output: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Output: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Where might someone find old clothing? Choices:  A: trunk B: drawer C: suitcase D: book shelf E: washing machine<n>Output:		A: trunk<n>B: drawer<n>C: suitcase<n>D: book shelf<n>E: washing machine<n>So the final answer was 2-E because the washing machine is not an option in the question stem.<n><n>Input: Which of the following represents the fewest number of eggs? Choices: A: 1 B: 0 C: 7 D: 5<n>Output: A: 1<n>B: 0<n>C: 7<n>D: 5<n>So the final answer A: 1 because it represents the fewest number<n><n>Input: There is a 5 in 25 cents. How much change would you get from a 6 in 25 cen ts?<n>Output: Since we already know a 5 in 35 cents makes 5 cents, we just have to substitute a 6 in 35 cen ts in place of the 5 in 30 cents and we know what answer we need<n>So the final answer: 8<n><n>Input: Lola is building a block tower. She needs 20 blocks for the top row and 35 blocks for the second row. After setting her blocks up, she finds that the second row contains 2 odd blocks. How many blocks are in her tower?<n>Output: We start by solving for b which is 2x + 2y = 79, which b = ((2x + 2 * 2y) / 79) = <<2x+2*(2y)/79=b>>b. So b is 22, and x is not a whole number therefore b-2 is going to be 0 or 1 and b is 22 therefore there are 22 blocks in the first row.<n>On the second row we have to find all possible number of blocks, so there is 35-2 which is 33, there are 33 blocks, then subtract 1(surely we can't have an odd number of blocks). So one block was 34, meaning the second row is 33 blocks.<n>Thus, we have 22 blocks in first row, and 33 blocks in the second row, which is 55 blocks in the tower.<n>So the final answers are 22, 33, and 55

After 30 minutes, Tom’s train was 85 miles ahead of Jim’s train. How long was the train ride if it took Tom 125 minutes to cover 85 miles?<n>Output: Let' s start 1st with the question Tom's train was 80 miles ahead of Jim's after 30 mins. Let' s call distance 80. So we are now given distance A and distance B, where distance A< distance B, right?<n>distance A / distance B = <<A/B=0.1>>0.1 miles per minute difference.<n>So we take it as 125 / 0.1 = <<125/0.1=1250>>1250 minutes for Tom.<n>Distance A + distance B x ((distance A / distance B) x minutes) = <<A+B*(0.1*(1250))>>2500. This equals to 80 * 2500 = 200000.<n>So the answer is 2000.<n><n>Input:  I can’t go to the party, because  I need to  go to the library and return a book.  I have five library books to return.

Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n>Output:		Choose C: Candy store or Kitchen in the first part of the sentence.<n>The second sentence describes what the subject, the kids, can find there. The subject in this sentence can refer to A, B, C, D, or E, but it is specifically a reference to kids. We also know that treats are only bought over the counter so to get more words, we could eliminate A, B, D and E. We’re left with two possible choices: C and E. C could really just be read as candy, but if we don’t count this as a match, it gives us more words to work with. So the final answer is E<n><n>Instruction:Answer the following matching and multiple choice question.<n>Match (1 point for each correct match):<n>Input: Choose one of the following statements:A) This question is hard!B) The next quiz will involve less math and more problem solving.<n>Output: The subject of the question can be referred to either A or B, so we match them.<n>A) <<A>>This question is hard!<n>B) <<B>>The next quiz will involve more problem solving.<n>Instruction:Answer questions 15 and 16.<n>If we had chosen different A and B statements in the first question, we would definitely get different questions in this second one. We want to find words in the first set of input that can go to the same output. There are several words in the statement that can go to either B or A, like “you”, “I” and “one”.<n>There aren’t a lot of words in this that are only in A or B though.<n>We can get rid of C because it is not in B or A.<n>We can also get rid of D “I’m thinking” because it could be referring to me or the general audience. We can also get rid of E because it refers back too B which we know is the same as A.<n>That leaves us with only <<You, I and A>>.  There are more words that can go to B than A though so B is definitely one of the choices. The easiest answer would be A and B because they both fit, but I have to get to at least one correct answer. So the final answer has to be AB<n><n>Instruction:For questions 17 and 18, choose the best answer<n><n>Input: Cho

So how many people can come to the party?<n>Output: The only possibilities are 2 guys, 5 guys or 5 girls. Hence the answer has an odd number of girls, so there can only be an odd number of girls<n>If there were 2 guys, than the total number of people coming has to be even, as if it was not even, then there would be at least 2 guys and 2 girls. But that is not true. So we can't have 2 guys.<n>So let's start with 5 guys, but then if there were 5 girls, than the total number would be odd and we'd end up with 4 girls and 5 guys, which is still even. Hence there can't be 5 girls either.<n>So a party, we can have only a 1-1 ratio of males to females, i.e. males=odd number of girls. So we'll just assume that males = odd number of girls. For convenience, let odd number of girls = <<1stguy>>2.<n>If there were 1stguy + 2ndguy - girl1 then the total number of people comes to be even, which is a contradiction, which is true, so it can't happen.<n>Hence if 1stguy is odd then 2ndguy = <<2ndguy>>3 is also odd (because males=odd number of girl1). So the total number becomes even and there is female, which is a contradiction to 1stguy being odd. So 1stguy can't be even and the final answer is 2.<n><n>Input: A store that s

Choices:  A: neighborhood B: subdivision C: city D: suburbs E: street<n>Output:		The city is enclosed by other places, so C is out.<n>If he wanted a house in the neighborhood that was gated off, that would mean searching the subdivisions which are inside of the neighborhood.<n>Now he has 2 choices remaining, either the suburbs which also are inside of the city, or the city.<n>To choose between the 2 places in the city, he can use the suburb as a guideline that separates the 2 areas inside the city.<n>Since he has never looked at any houses in the city, he would probably start from the suburbs and then slowly progress to the city as he narrows his choices.<n>In the end, he would buy a house in the city<n>So the final answer choice D: City is the best answer<n><n>Input: A boy named Ben and his brother, Tom decide to save their allowance to buy a toy. Ben saves 40% from each dollar he earns and Tom saves 15% from each dollar they earn. In three weeks, they saved $12 and $138 dollars respectively. How many dollars did each boys earn each week?<n>Output: Ben saves 40 / 100 = <<40/100=0.4>>0.4 of each dollar he earn, which means (12 / 0.4) x 40 = <<12/0.4=30>>30 dollars/week<n>Tom saves 15 / 100= <<15/100=1.5 >> 1.5 * 40 = <<40*1.5=60>>60 dollars/week<n>So the final answer  is 30+60= <<30+60 =90>>90 dollars/week<n><n>Input: A company is going to hold a meeting and they are going to charge a cost of $42 per person to attend.

Choose the one process for choosing the President that you must have to guarantee that a group of X members always selects one person to function as its president.<n>Output: To guarantee that a group of  X members always selects one president, two elections are necessary.  Let's call the first election, the nomination election.  Each member of the group nominates one individual, X or less.  (A member of the group may nominate him/herself.)    In the second election, known as the election to elect the president, each member of the group votes for the person he/she nominated as president. If one member nominated him/herself, that person can also be selected president if a majority of the membership of the group votes for him/her.<n><n>A majority of members must vote for a person proposed for president in the nomination election for that person to be elected. A simple majority is sufficient in the nomination election.<n>(The definition of a majority is the plurality of votes: the person getting the most votes. In an election between three people, the one getting more votes than any other person is the majority.)    If a person is not elected as president in the election to elect the<n>president because of a tie vote, another nomination election is not required. The group can select the person receiving the next highest vote, assuming this person is not the same person nominated in the first election.<n>Choice B has all of our necessary steps to guarantee that a group  with X members will always pick a president. The main difference is that in the nomination election step,  B limits each member to nominating a specified number of eligible members, X or less.<n><n>1. Which process must you have to guarantee that the group will always select a president?<n>A. A majority selection after two election steps.<n>B. A majority selection after three election

You reach into the box and randomly pick one ball. What is the probability that you will pick a white ball?<n>Output: There are a total of 12 balls, and of then 6 are red and 4 are white. So 12 / 6 = 2 white balls in the box<n>So the solution here is 6/12<n><n>Input:# of people who went to the movies:27<n># of 75 minute-movies:6<n># of people who stayed through intermission:<<17>>17<n># of people who have already been to the movies:<<5>>5<n># of people who skipped lunch so they didn’t have to get out of school:<<12>>12 * 1/62 * 1/12 <n>Output: There were 27 that wanted to stay to watch the movie. Now if 17 stayed because there were 2 intermissions and also 12 skipped lunch, it means that we can subtract the 17 and 12 to get 6, who stayed from the beginning. Now we divide it back to the whole group: 27/12 = <<27/12=2.25>>2.25 people.<n>So the number is 2.25.<n><n>#!/bin/bash<n>x=0<n>while [[ -n "$1" ]]; do <n>    case "$1" in<n>        [0-9.]+) x=$((x*10)) "$1"<n>    esac<n>    shift<n>done<n>echo "I think the answer is : $x"<n>

He would get up in the morning, and then put them in what state again? Choices:  A: upside down B: in motion C: active D: wakefulness E: resthold<n>Output:		"in motion" is the correct answer.<n>The rubber balls were initially at rest, which means the state of them is at rest.  Therefore, the final state will be something other than "at rest".  The choices don't quite fit the problem structure, so consider that the bounce upwards is the opposite of a ball that previously rolled or bounced in the upward direction.  Then consider that once a ball is in motion, it will continue moving unless something stops it (this could be a collision with another object, hitting the bottom, etc.).  Therefore, "in motion" is true.<n><n>Input: Aaron made a snack to share with his classmates. He gave 26% of the snack to each of his classmates.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Output: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Output: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:One way to relieve your hunger if you live near the coast is to do what? Choices:  A: grill B: go to market C: bring home fish D: eat hamburger E: make bread<n>Output:		If you live near the coast, instead of buying fish, you can just go fishing, catch your own fish and eat it.<n>So grill, market and hamburger are not the answer<n><n>Input: Two teachers at the school went out for lunch and each of them ordered 3 quesadillas. One of the teachers decided to buy lunch for her coworker and spent altogether $25.

There is a supernatural energy field and each of them can use one square of the field to teleport one mile. <n>They each have their own strategy to teleport the farthest possible. Write a script to determine which strategy is the best.<n>Output:<n>You start by calculating how many squares you will need.<n>Since there are 4 astral beings and they each need one square to teleport, 4 x 1 = <<4*1=4>>4  The field to teleport will need 4 squares<n><n>If you teleport in the same spot you start, you would need to use 2 squares<n>You would end up with 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>4 squares for teleporting<n>If you are teleported each square twice, you would end up with 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = <<1+2+4+8=15>>15 squares<n>If you were only teleported twice you would end up with only 4 squares because the supernatural energy field only allows one square to cover multiple squares<n>But since you need 4 squares no matter what, to be the "strategy" <n> you just need to do 4 squares every time<n>So the answer is 4 <n><n>	You can use a simple for loop. You get to decide if you want to use the same variable to hold your value or have a new variable. <n><n>Input: A school has both first and second grade students enrolled. For its party, it is buying chocolate candies, gumballs, and cookies

Next, each piece is packaged into a 48 g package. How much does the cheese cost per gram when purchased from the cheese maker?<n>Output: The first thing to look at is that the amount of cheese and the amount of packages, since 9=<<9=4>>4, and 48 g means we have one package with 48 g cheese.<n>Then we need to get the 48 g/9 = <<48/9=5.33>>5.33 grams per piece of cheese when we cut it into 9 pieces.<n>We can buy 9 pieces and get 48 g of cheese. Each piece weighs 5.33 gram.<n>So we are now done with 9 pieces and each piece has 5.33 gr per piece.<n>We need to know how many pieces and what’s the weight of each package.<n>So we have the answer of 9 pieces and the weight of each piece is 5.33g.<n>So the next thing we can do is multiply how much cheese by how much piece is needed.<n>Since we need 9 equal pieces, hence all of the pieces weighs the same, so the weight is 5.3g/9g = <<5.3g/10=0.53>>0.53g<n>So the amount of cheese in each package is 9 x 0.53=<<9*0.53=4.97>>4.97<n>So the final answer in this part is 4.97<n><n>Input: What is the value of the expression: (7 + 2.63*0.93)*1.025/2.6%?<n>Output: We need to simplify the expression.<n>So 7-2.63*<0.93> = <<7-2.6*0.93=-2.18>>-2.18<n>The remaining expression is (7/1.025)-(2.18/

To calculate how much more he volunteered than the 40 year old,  start by finding the ratio of how much the 70 year old volunteered versus how much the 40 year did.<n>The ratio is 70 //40 = <<70/40=1.75>>1.75<n>Multiply this by 10 to find the amount the 40 year has volunteered.<n>10*1.75 = <<10*1.8> =18>>18 and then subtract that from the original number.<n>70 - 18 = <<70-18=52>>52<n>The 40 year old person probably volunteered 40 years and the 70 year person probably volunteered 32 years. (32 is a round number and not likely to be exact, but close).<n>The 40 volunteered 32 / 40 = <<32/40=0.8>>0.8 more than 40 years and 70 volunteered 20 / 32 = <<20/32=0.6>>0.6 more than 70 years.<n>To determine the difference, we take 40 // 20 ≈ <<40/20=2>>2 and 70 // 42 ≈ <<70/42=1.6>>1.6.<n>So the final difference is 2 - 1.6 = <<2-1.6=0.4>>0.4<n>So the final answer will be 0

He had a hangup.  He didn't like to be what? Choices:  A: orgasm B: cum C: naked D: in bed E: wearing his birthday suit<n>Output:		The word that John 'didn't like' is having kids. He 'had a hangup', so it means something that he doesn't enjoy.<n>Let's start with part (A).  Does John like Orgasms?  John likes doing these with his significant other.  So No.<n>Part (B).  John doesn't like Cum.  He likes doing it to his significant other, but he doesn't like having it, nor does he like having someone else do it to him.  So no again.<n>Part (C).  No clue.<n>Part (D):  John likes it.<n>Part (E):  Yes.<n>So the answer is B<n><n>Output: The word 'having kids' is in the sentence that the other word is 'what'.  The 'what' is 'enjoying procreating'.  So John is talking about how he doesn't 'enjoy procreating' because he has a 'hangover'.<n>John doesn't want to 'enjoy procreate', which is why no to (A, C, and D).<n>John doesn't enjoy having kids, so B is the only answer.<n>So the answer to the puzzle is B<n><n>Output:'Never give up.'  It applies to any problem: to any work or any relationship.<n>When I was an undergraduate at Caltech in the 1960's, my graduate thesis advisor, Professor Jim Fleming, told me that one of the best books about solving puzzles--about solving problems in general--was a book called Never Give Up: A Collection of Inspiring Stories, by W.E. Cummings. It contained a compilation of all sorts of problems that people had to solve in their lives, and in the book, each story was accompanied by a single word that summarized the essence of the story.<n>The word 'never give up' was used to describe any story that described somebody who overcame a seemingly insoluble problem and who learned, through that hard work, to prevail.<n>For example, there was one story in the book about a family who moved into a large, old  house full of cobwebs and rodents, and there were problems of all sorts to overcome.  Finally, it was very clear that it was too

How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

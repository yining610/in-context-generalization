{"text": "if we look at the pronunciations of the words  you see that they are not all similar.  You will never find a lemon in a hole and a lemon isn't something you put in a field either.  It's hard to think of a place to stay at home that starts in an H or an A that aren't also used to describe someplace you live, like  a home or hole.  If you were looking for this animal you would expect to be able to use different syllables  to describe the place your looking.\nSince Russia starts with an R, it isn't that choice, since at home starts with A, you can't use it. Now if you think about the word field, at first it doesn't really ring any bells since it is a general word for something you would never associate a Lemur with being in.  A lemur is generally an animal that you would see in trees and the middle of the word field would never be applied to that type of animal.\nSo the final choice is E, as that would be the correct answer, and for those who didn't figure it out you can be satisfied by knowing that if you were looking for lemons a Hole would be the best place to look.\n\nInput: I have a soccer ball that I can kick.

If no stroke happens it's 0 strokes.  If there's one stroke and no", "answer": "D: field"}

The gym does allow people to buy a membership if it is their first time using your gym.  It costs an extra $100 for the first time.  How much do you have left over?\nOutput:  You go 4 times a month and each time costs $20 leaving you with $20 + $20x4 = $40$40\nEach month you pay $20 + $40 = $60$60 for your monthly membership and gym access\nThen, each of the 1st 2 months that you go to the gym will cost you about $20 + $100+$100 = $140\nSo the last month you pay $40 for your monthly gym membership and all 4 months you spend $20 each time you go\nYou have $40-$140 = -$100 left over.

(That's also 1.41 E+11)\nAnswer:\nWe have to compare the two numbers according to the scale on which they are written. \"E+17\" means 10^17 and \"E+11\" means 10^{11}. In other words one hundred trillion, one hundred billion.\nWe also need to remove the unnecessary digits in the bigger number. The number is 2.0*10^{12}+ 17 (two billion trillion and seventeen)\n\nThe number we have to compare is 62 (two hundred and twenty)\n\n\nTo convert 2.04*10^12+17 into decimal, it will be like this: 2.0425999995 * 10^-12(2^-12)*17\nAs the number will be a very small fraction, it might not be possible to do the conversion. But, we can approximate it by approximating the big number in the numerator as well as the small number in the denominator: 2.0*2^-6*10^-12 (1% close)\nSo now the whole expression is 2.00157e-6 * 10^-06*10^-06 (close but again, not really close)\n\nSimilar approximation can be done to the smaller number: 20.017e-05 * 10^06 (close but not close enough)\n\nTo get a much much much close value, we would need to go to the next power of 10, which we can only do on a calculator. To do that, we need to multiply 20.17 * 10^-3. so we get: 0.20017*10^-4. And the next power of 2 to that is 2^-4 = 1/16. We can now approximate", "answer": "B: fire"}

Every day, half of the fish die. The new fish are added back in to exactly replace those that died each day. For every fish removed, the total number of fish decreases by 99% (i.e. if there are 3 fish removed, there are now 0.75*3 = 2.25 fish left, which is now the total number). The pond will never run dry.  How many fish are in the pond at the end of 2 weeks? Output:We know the pond will run dry in 513 years, so\n\nThe total amount of fish in the pond can be written in two ways: 4004 or 8/3\nSo 4004+8=4012 which is the amount of fish at the end of 1 week. But since the number of fish decreased by 99%, there are 2.25 less fish than the original amount we added. Since the pond starts out with 8, the amount of fish at any point is 8-(513/7) = 8+/-0 + 8 /3 = 8 (which is the original amount minus the decrement factor for 2 weeks)4004 is the final number of fish after the 2 week period.\n\nInput:  After Mary makes brownies for the party, she has 12 eggs.

There are buses that he could take to get to work, but he prefers to walk. He prefers to walk because he doesn\u2019t like to be stuck in traffic. On the other hand, each bus might make him late for work. There are 5 buses that go to work. For each bus, he needs to weigh two factors: 1. the time spent getting to the bus stop; 2. the time spent waiting for the bus. For each bus, the time spent getting to and waiting for the bus is less than the time spent getting to work if he rides the bus. However, getting to work on time is more important to him: he doesn\u2019t want to miss the start of his shift.\nOutput:The man should take bus 2. Busses 1 and 3 would mean that he has to drive to their stops, take the bus, then take the bus again and walk from the bus stop. Busses 4 and 5 would mean that after taking the bus to the depot, he would still have to drive to his depot, so there\u2019s no shortcut and he\u2019ll still be late. The best case scenario is if he drives and takes bus 2, which would save time and get him to work on time\n\n#### Example answer:(He will drive and take bus 2)\n\nInput:The man should take car 1.  Every other way is also impossible. (He should take a car that is closer because it save time)This man should take car 2 as well. (The man should take the easiest way to get to work )\n\n#### Example answer((He should take car 1 and car 2 because they are the easiest))\n\nInput:The girl who was supposed to go on the scavenger hunt found out yesterday that she can\u2019t go.

If you travel at an average rate of 45 mph, what time should you leave the airport?\nOutput: Given current time and flight arrival time.  Let's assume current time is 4:55 with flight arrival time at 5:00.  You have to leave the airport before 5:00 so let's say 4:50 departure time.  At 4:50 you will be going at 4:50 speed.  So at 5:01 you will be taking the flight which takes the rest time 1 minute to arrive your final destination.  At 5:05 you are at the airport and it's going at 4:00 speed.  \nSo total time for destination plus flight time is 4:05+1=5:06+1=5:86\nFrom destination to airport is 64 miles and at 4:05, you will go at 4:04 speed.  So 64/4:05 = 64/4 = 16 minutes\n64/4 +6 = 20 minutes left for airport to pick you up.\nSo the time to leave airport is 4:50 - 20 = 4:30", "answer": "E: town"}

{"text": "We only buy in Michigan Park.\n\nInput:We have 25 students in our program. We have a certain amount of seats in the classroom. If students sit in the front of a classroom, they have less of an opportunity to learn as everyone can see them. If they sit in the back, they have an easier time learning. If we have too many students to fit in a classroom, we have to break up some into two sections. If we have too few students for two sections, we don't waste money on hiring extra staff.\nOutput:If we have 25 seats and 52 students want to take the class, we can fit 8 students per section if they were all on opposite sides of the classroom. If we had 72 students, we would fit 16 students per section if they switched side of the classroom every two days. If we had 26 students, we would have to split the class with 13 students per section.\n\n##Explanation:\nIn the first exercise, Zach currently has $65, his weekly allowance is 5 and he mows the laundry for $10 and then he babysits and earns 14 dollars that day. Add $29 to his current $65 he has to save to have $94 dollars. In mowing the laundry, he earned an extra 10. With Babysitting, he earned an extra $4. To answer the question, Zach needs to earn as much as $100-65 dollars. Since he has already earned $94 dollars, Zach should save $100-90 dollars. His answer should be 10.0568019123172.\n\nIn the second exercise, we have 25 students but only 25 seats. Since in the back of the classroom we would be better off learning than in front of it, the students that are 25 seats would be the maximum amount of seats we can fit per section. With 25 students in one section and no extra classroom seats, we would have to have two classes to make our education fair. However, if we have 52 students in one classroom, we can break them up into two sections per classroom.\n\nIn the third exercise, we have 52 seats and", "answer": "E: retail store"}

Two students want to be considered a team.  The team with the highest grade will win.  There is extra funding if each team has more than 3 students.  This extra funding is distributed at 60% per team, and 40% per student.  How many student teams will win funding?\nOutput: To use the Funding, we cannot have all students be on the same team because not enough students would be together to divide the funding equally as well as each student wouldnt get even distribution.  If we have 4 students as shown, 4 each get $0 and 2 each get $20.  But if there is 5 students, 2 are in each team and 2 are by themselves.  If there is $x students, 2 get $20 each.  For $x-2, each team gets $30 and each person on the team gets $15.  So, we need at least 5 students (not 4) and at least 60% of the students who get funding are together as a team.  Since our answer is 2, we do not give the extra funding, so what we get is 2*60% = 2*0.6 = 1.2  Our total funding is 2*40% = 2x0.4 = $0.8.  After we add in the funding we gave to each student, the students in team of $1 get an extra $1.600.6=$1.16/1.60 and the students in $2 get an extra $4.801.16=$3.96/1.6 and each get $7.82.", "answer": "E: procrastination"}

What are the dimensions of Gordon's house now?\nOutput:Let x and x' be the dimensions of his house. We're told that the second parallelogram measures x feet on the long side and (x+.5) feet on the short side. Thus, x-=.5. Similarly, the short side of the second parallelopath measures x' feet. x+.5+x'=8, so 2(x+.5)+x'=9. Since this holds for both the parallelograms, we can simply add them to get a total of x +x'=.5 feet in between the two sides of the house.

When engineers are working at the office, they will often work in a group on a certain project and each member of the group would probably own their own ruler.\nB: (100 points) You could definitely find a ruler that belongs to different people in England. King of England used to make a law where everyone was required to own a ruler. So, if you go to a museum in England, you would probably be able to find tons of rulers that belong to different people.\nC:  (50 points): You would also be able to find a multiple ruler in a drawer because of the following reasons.  Everyone has their own desk, but the desk might be shared with another person. For example, a student would have their own desk but then share the desk with 2 of their friends. So, the students might each own a ruler and use their own ruler to measure distance. The multiple ruler theory works in this situation because the students can all use their own ruler. \nIf you take the student example from above and apply it to a company, multiple rulers can be found in a drawer where you have employees that are each working on their own project. The multiple ruler works there because each employee would each have their own desk and use their own rulers to measure distances/lengths in their project.\nD:  (50): You would definitely be able to find multiple rulers on a desk because a single ruler can represent many people. If I own my own desk and then another person that I know shares the desk with me, I can use one ruler to represent my own and theirs.\nE:  (0 points). A desk is one table that belongs to one person.

Now, it is time to draw random numbers.  In this exercise, we will use the rand method to draw random numbers without displaying them.  Below in the code, we have a function named rnd.  We start with rand(0, 10), which returns a between 0 and 10, inclusive. Then we create a loop and change rand(0,10) to a variable, i.  rand(0 10) is a value (i.e. 1, 2, 3,...) but never returns that value directly.  In the loop, i changes for each iteration, so rand() will return a random number every pass through the loop. We display this number in a print statement, and the loop terminates when the value of i equals our random number, 5.\n\n##### Code:\nRandomNumber=randint(0,100)\nif RandomNumber = 5:\n    print('You won! Good Job')\n    break\n\n##### Output:\nYou won!\n\nRandomNumber=rand(0, 12)\nif RandomNumber=2\nprint('you won!')\nelif RandomNumber > 15\nprint ('You won!')\n\n##### Output\nYou won!

These vessels are usually used for coastal and intercoastal water travel because of their relatively low speed limits compared to motorized water vessels.<br>There are two main types of human powered water craft: sailboats and row boats. These two types of boats differ in the number of sailors and the type of sail used. <br>Sailboats have sails, a triangular-shaped cloth, attached to a horizontal surface (mast) that moves the wind to propel the sailboat forward. They are operated by a person, or team of persons, on the deck. These boats also use oars, long poles, to steer the craft in specific directions. <br>Row boats do not use sails, however, they can still achieve considerable speeds.

A ritual involves taking part in a set of actions that are regarded as symbolically important or significant. These actions could be physical, verbal, or both. In some traditions the egg is often given as a gift to wish someone good health and peace or it could signify the presence of the spirit of spring as it is seen as a symbol. The egg symbolism in Christianity has its roots in the Biblical story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is believed that the egg laid at Easter represents renewal of life with the coming of spring. If it was Easter egg hunting was popular in England in 1878 thanks to Count Apponyi of Hungary who brought the custom to England after hearing about it in France. The first Easter egg hunt in England happened in the Great Park at Windsor and that was where people chased eggs. On a historical note, an egg is a symbol of the Spring that represents resurrection and fertility. Another reason the man gave the chocolate cake to the man as a gift for his birthday could be that he wants to celebrate his birthday in a special way and make his day happy and memorable. He might be planning on having a special dinner out with family and friends or even go out of town on vacation to celebrate. Easter egg hunting was introduced among the upper classes of the society in the United States in the 19th century but didn\u2019t catch on. Chocolate Easter eggs became popular in the United States by 1860. The tradition of painting and hiding Easter eggs is believed to have originated in Mesopotamia.\n\n### The only answer that works here:  B\n\nInput: The woman was taking her daughter to school when she realized that she had forgotten the lunch box.

This is a day of rest so she can only speak to welcome the guests The next person to speak is the guest who arrives next, so it has to one of the males.  This is also a day of rest but the men were not at home so the second person does not speak  Since they do not speak we can assume that they are brothers because a brother is always with his brother on the first and last days of his B.Y. calendar The first brother then has to speak the next time someone says something because everyone else has already spoken.  This brother then tells all the guests to say thank you to the hostess for hosting them The next person to speak cannot be a girl nor the next brother since they have already spoken as well as the last person to speak  The last person to speak is in fact the first brother's wife and she says thank you to the host for having them over   Since they are done speaking everyone else is welcome to say whatever they want and when they do the riddle is over\n\nInput: Alice wants to be a mathematician.

These two animals are actually from different families of animals and could not possibly be called the same thing.\nOf the four choices above, the native lemur could be represented by either the Cage or the Habitat choice.  Each comes from a different part of a rainforest in a different country. A Lemur cage is a separate enclosed room in the zoo and does not contain just lemurs.  A habitat could be just a section of the rainforest that contains lemurs, or it could also mean that a group of lemurs resides in the same area.\nA native lemur is not found in a hole (they do not make their dens underground) nor do they live in a city or anywhere else that is not a rain forest, so the other three choices are eliminated. The lemur habitat requires trees which means that the lemur would be found in the Amazon (rain forest, not river).

Each student must take a midterm exam. There is a total of 180 points for the exams. All of the scores in are scaled so, that the smallest value is 10. The scoring is done as follows. A student takes 90 points off the top for the lowest score and then 10 points off for each additional point scored. The maximum number of points a student can score is 400. Each student scores 140 points on the exam. How many students must take the exam?\nOutput: 17 students which is 11 greater than the original 16. To receive a 400 (150-150), 16 people would have to have to have 400 points. (Based on the problem itself, we can assume that there would be at least some grade above 140. So this problem would have to repeat itself 16X more for the maximum of 400 to be reached.) This means that 228 points need to be removed.

The plane is a 747.\nAnswer: \"A 747 can seat 54 people on two decks and hold up to 416.\"\nThis means 416-54 = <<416-55=361>>361 and then that means that 361+54 = 415 which means that you can fit 415 people on a 747\nSince we have 180 seats and 200 people hold the total seats would be 180/2=<<180/2>>90 and you would fit 90 extra people\n\n\nThe final answer = 90\n\n# My Instruction:  Instructions: I will type down my ideas for the code and the explanation can be typed by one of my friends.\n\n### my idea :\n\n# code = \"A 740 can seat 54, people\n#        on two decks and fit up\n#        to 416.  \"\n\n# my friend will type the explanation\n\n# my friend :\n\n# The explanation is that the two extra 200 people is to the capacity.

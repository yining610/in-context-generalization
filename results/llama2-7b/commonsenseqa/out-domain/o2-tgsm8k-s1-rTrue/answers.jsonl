The doctor told him: \"If you don't want to have a cast on both of your legs, just ask nicely.\"\n\"OK,\" said Jack, \"I've changed my mind, please don't cast my left leg.\"\n\"That's fair,\" said the doctor, \"I think I can manage without that.  Now, if you don't care what happens to your other leg...?\"\n\n### Answer\n\n\"Yes?\" responded Jack, confused.\n\n### Answer 2:\n* Jack: Doctor, if I make a request for my right leg, and I make a request for something that I want, then I don\u2019t want it for my other leg.\n* Response: You have a left leg, do you not?\n* Jack: Yes, but I don\u2019t really care for it.\n\n### Response\nHe went with the second explanation.\n* Jack: Oh okay, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean I DON\u2019T CARE for it, yes I do care for it a little bit so I hope I won\u2019t get a cast on it.\n\n##   The first explanation seemed to be the most convincing.  In the example, it seemed as though Jack asked a question, \u201cDo you doctor not wanna cast [it on] my good leg?\u201d  This was definitely a mistake and would have been corrected to, \u201cDo you think it is better to cast [it on] both of my legs?\u201d\n\n## Explanation 1\nHonestly.\nThe only thing the doctor heard in this scenario was, \"If I don't want a cast on both my legs..\"  He didn't even hear the entire sentence.  All he heard for the first half of this was the word, \"want\".  In a moment he didn't want a cast to be on both legs but he didn't know to ask if the other leg could be spared!\n\n## The first explanation that he gave seemed to be the most logical.  He was almost correct about using the second explanation.  With the second explanation, he would say, \"So if I could ask for my right leg to be okay, could the other leg be okay?

An office could be considered a place where people listen a religious speech where they are talking about work as office is a place that everyone has daily life.

Therefore, Gertrude asks Bella, the Maltese most likely resembles the Poodle, because if the Poodle were a crossbreed of a dog and another dog, then the Poodle most closely resembles the dog that the Poodle was crossbred with.

{"text": "Answer A: big house\n\n### Rationale:\nOne should assume that the child has many areas in his/her life where the child will be able to run amok.\n\n### Input:: Answer the following mathematical quiz question.\nThere is a bacterium that can multiply at a rate of 9.2 per hour and can not multiply forever because it dies.  The bacterium can grow exponentially, but once the bacterium is doubled it cannot double again at that rate.  Is this a growing function?\n\n\n### Response:: Answer B: exponential growth.\n\n### Rationales:\nAssume the bacteria can double every hour at its initial 9.2 growth rate, doubling in size every hour, it will grow exponentially at 9.2 x 9.2= <<9.2*9.2=89>>89\nAn exponential growth rate decreases with each interval and this can not happen because when the bacteria doubles to 9, it must double again to become 18 and double again, so it's rate decreases after doubling.\nHence its growth rate is a non exponential rate of 1 and this is impossible.\n\n### The following question has no correct or incorrect answer.

S: Anita has a headache all day but is going to the gym anyway. She will take two Advil and something to drink before going. Why is the correct sentence grammatically correct?\n\n### Demostration: \nInput:Anita has had a head ache all day. She feels it is going to make us sick, but she'e going to the gym. She's going take two Advil and some thing to drink before she goes\nRationales: The phrase  she'e going to take is modifying the object she, so we can say that she and the Advil are subject in the sentence. You can replace  Anita+Advil by she,  so the clause S is subject.  The word gym is a object in the sentence, and the part before the that are the prepositional phrase. The sentence S:Anita has a headache is  a  subject, which is also a noun.  Since we said before \"the gym\" was object, we can apply the same reasoning to this, and say that the headache is the noun.\n#### \nThe reason it is grammatically correct is because  if the sentence is S: Anita has had all day headache, she is the subject, so  \"She'\" must be a noun. The prepositional phrase before \"all day\" is head ache, and since it is modifying the main clause \"all day\", all day is the object here. The subject is she and the prepositional phrase is the object. We have to know that \"head ache\" is modifying she, so the head ache is subject. Anita is then adverb because her head ache is modifying her other pronoun. This sentence is like S: anita has a head ache so she feels really bad,  \"she\" is the subject and  \"head ache\" the object in the sentence.  We can apply the same technique to sentences like S:She has 5 apple. We", "answer": "C: red barn"}

{"text": "Input:\nWhat could fighting inflation\ncause if it is not successful\n\nIf you ask what could fighting inflation cause, it could be that it results in deflation, which is when your money no longer has the same spending power. This can also cause economic instability, not very noticeable in our day to day lives. If you ask what deflation could also cause, that could be that the public doesn't do anything to buy, but rather they wait until they can buy it for less. This may cause the economy to slow down, and when the public starts to buy again, the prices rise, resulting in an inflationary scenario. This is where fighting inflation may have deflationary side effects. If you ask what are some of the other drawbacks of fighting inflation, a possible answer could be that it may create a vicious cycle. If people who do not save money spend money they don't have and if that inflation occurs, the cost of everything will increase, making it even harder to save money, and thus creating a cycle.\n\n####\nAnswer:\n\n### Response\nInput: If I am a seller and the market demand is high, what is my best choice\n\nResponse: If I am a business owner and the market demand is extremely high, my best course of action is to increase my prices just a little bit in order not to lose out on money. This is my best choice because I want to cash in on the moment while the prices are extremely high and the demand is high. This also depends on my business and how high demand is. For instance, if it is for fresh vegetable stand, if the demand is extreme, then I would increase my prices just a bit in order to make more money, without hurting the profit too much. If I had a small business, then I might not do this since I only make small amounts of money, but I would have to increase prices a high amount and might end up losing out on clients.\n\n### Input::You are considering buying a house.

We could also say adding 83 to 9 and subtracting the sum of 18, 83 and 10(addition/subtraction) from 103.\n\n\n* Sam needs to perform addition  \n\n \n### \n\n### Input \nMike made \ud83c\udf26\ufe0f  cash register receipts and is now using \ud83d\udcc2  them to cut \ud83d\udd2a out the lunch orders.

While walking to the store, the man passes by a broken heart necklace that is only $20.  On the same street, there is a diamond necklace that is priced at $400.  Which is the best deal of the two?\n\nDemonstration:\nChoosing the diamond necklace is the best deal. The man could have used the broken heart necklace as long as he was with his wife.  Since he doesn't get to enjoy that gift while he's away,  he'd be better off buying the diamond necklace for $400 so that his wife can enjoy it while he is away.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe broken heart necklace can be used as long as he's with is wife.  She can enjoy it by wearing it, touching it or even by talking to it if she wanted.\nThe diamond necklace is useless to him unless his wife is with him.  He can't enjoy it by wearing or touching it.

What is the probability that 1) a cat has a white stripe on its back?\n\n### Response1:\n\n\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThe probability of a cat having a white stripe on it's back is $\\frac{4 \\choose 2}{7 \\choose 4}$ =  $\\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{7 \\cdot 5}$=  $\\frac{4\\cdot 2}{7\\cdot 6}= \\frac{8}{49}$\n\n\n##  Response 2\n\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThere are two ways we can choose two different colors, so we write: $\\frac{1}2$ =  $\\frac{2}7$\n\nNext, since there are seven cats in total, we need to divide by seven, which brings $\\frac{1}7$:  $\\frac{1}{7}$ = $\\frac{2}{7} $\n\nFinally, we add two probabilities together, bringing the probability of having a cat with a white stripe to $\\frac{2}{14}$.\n\n### Rational:  There are two tvs: a new one that costs $10*12 $ and another old one that costs $3*\\frac{3}2$.

{"text": "John wants a place to stay. He isn't going to spend much money on his hotel.  John is staying in a farm.\n\nRationales: John isn't picky about his hotel. He picks the cheapest place to stay.  John might be staying on the farm because he is going out in the farm.  It does not matter to him if the place is nice as he is going to be outside for most of the time.\n\n#### Motel vs Hotel\n\nMotel is more expensive and offers more luxuries. It has more facilities and offer more services. If you are going to travel a lot and do not like staying in a farm, hotel is a great choice. If you are on a short trip and go to a different place most of the time, motel is a good choice.\n\nMotels are located away from town or other urban areas as much as possible, with a distance of at least one mile. A number of motels are built along major highways of the United States and other English-speaking countries.\n\nHotels are located in the city center or near it, and the choice of locations is done in order to attract maximum possible number of customers. Hotels are more expensive than motels, and they offer a range of services to the guests, so the choice of hotel is often limited to those who can afford it.\n\n### Question:John wanted to buy a phone.  He had $130 in his pocket and he used that money to buy accessories. He had $65 in cash to use for buying a phone. He bought a phone using a coupon and ended up paying $70 for the phone. How much money did he have left?\nRationales :\nJohn's total amount with accessories :<<130+65=73>>73\nJohn used 130$ to buy the accessories and rest 65$ cash is for the phone.\nJohn bought the phone after using the coupon so the final amount was : <<70>>70\nJohn's cash left after buying the phone=<<65-70>>-50\nJohn left with (<<70+73>-50) =<<123>>123\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn this task the input was an instruction", "answer": "E: motel"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C: listen carefully.\n\n### Input/Output: A salesman is looking to sell a product. He starts at $8 a pop. When he is out of the product, he raises the price by $2 a pop until he gets his desired profit. A customer buys 4 units and tells the salesman that they won't buy at the higher price. He ends up selling a total of 16 units. How much did the salesman sell his remaining stock for?  $20 / $2.50  $24 / $2.33  $28 / $2.24  $32 / $2.16\n\n### Response/Output: The correct answer is D: $30\n\nAnswer: The product cost the salesman $8 and he sold each for $10.\nThe total number of units sold is 16.\nThen, we subtract the original stock (4) from the total stock (16) and that gives us 12 which we multiply by $8 to get $96.\nThis means the salesman made $96 profit.\nNow, we divide the profit by the cost per unit to get the cost of the remaining stock\n$( 96 / 10 = 9.6) / 8 = 1.2$.\nIn other words, he made $12 profit per sale, thus making $12*16 = $204.\n(12*16)/2.5 = $30.\n\n#### 30\nAnswer: 12", "answer": "C: listen carefully"}

{"text": "I would play board games in my room, in the living room, or around my kitchen table with my family. This is because there are very few things to do in the toy shop. We don't have anything to eat in the store and there's no way to bring a board game to the store. I can also be pretty sure my family won't have time to play a board game in the shop. My family only goes to the toy shop to buy toys and we usually don't even go in there just for fun. It would also be pretty hard to play a board game while sitting on the toys display table at the shop because the table is full of toys and we can't sit there. The store floor is also too dirty to be playing games in. Another reason I would not play a board game with my family in the toy store is because my mom would never allow us to take food to the store. So if I were to get any snacks, I would have to sneak them in. We don't live near a school so there's no board game I would want to play somewhere in a school. A board game would be pretty boring for my family while we are eating lunch or walking around the school.

The value does not go negative, so it's always increasing.\nIf the second number is less than the third, in other words, | << -3+5+9>>20 if the first number is negative, it's still negative (even when we add or subtract). The second number becomes larger than the 3rd and when the last number is a large positive number, it is larger than this and eventually ends up being smaller than the first number. So the sign flips, which creates a negative absolute value and the number line starts to decrease.\n\nSince positive numbers always increase and negative numbers always decreases, positive minus a positive number is always positive. So, a plus two is always, will always be positive. Positive minus positive always positive.

There are options so we can't choose the correct one.\n\n* We have to check which answer is unchecked.\n\n* We can answer multiple choice question if we know the information and can choose the correct answer.\n\n* If we don't know the information, we can use hints to check our answers.\n\n* Notice that after we check we can go back to check our answers because we didn't know the information.\n\n### Extension:\n\n### Rationale:\nGiven that 777 is between 10,008 and 11,052, there is no need to use the hints. It provides us with answers as opposed to clues. 777 is a multiple of 7x108, and thus is divisible by 7. We can deduce that 777 / 7 = 108 and use the clue \"45\" and see that 108 + 45 = 153. We see that between 100 and 150. We can then determine that 999 (or 1000 - 1) is between 9,000 and 14,500, which implies that it is divisible by 230. 777 + 999 = 1776, which means that 777 + (999 / 108) = 1777 is between the 11,196 and 11,204. A prime number that is greater or equal to 2. We therefore deduce that 11,179 (230 * 50) is divisible by 50. 1777 * 50 = 93850 (11,178 + 7) and so the answer is that it is between 11,000 and the 11,027", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

To accomodate this growth, the mayor has decided to add 3 new bus lines to transport more residents to work more places. The buses run in the morning to and from downtown. The buses run to the north, west, and south areas during the day. They run late night (or evening) to get residents home from work.  How many people could this bus line system transport each day?

This means that they can be used to refer to one or two or three of something. The words, \"four\", \"five\" and \"six\" (and seven, eight and nine) are called \"ordinal\". This means that they show position, such as third, fifth and ninth. The words for these numbers were originally plural nouns, such as \"these\" or \"those\", or adjectives. In Old English singular nouns could be shown with an \"s\", but it often disappeared. For instance, \"six\" could be written as \"sixeth\" with the \"s\" disappearing after a while. As time went on, most modern languages changed the \"-eth\" ending into the letter \"s\" on its own for the plural, so today the word \"six\" is singular in most (but not all) modern languages.\n\nOne of the English words that survived the Middle Ages when so many of the original forms dropped away was \"one\". As with other nouns, \"one\" was shown with the word \"thon\", a short form of the word \"thise\" that is still in use today.", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

{"text": "The water comes from the sea or ocean; because the river is in direct contact with sea water, its salinity is also greater. If you throw a stone into the river, 2 cases may occur. The first case is that the stone does not completely submerge in water, then it will move to the shore. In this case, only the movement of solid and water bodies will affect the water level, the water level will rise and fall. The second case is that the stone sinks completely in the river. The force generated by the falling stone will drive a large amount of water to generate waves and currents in the water body. In order for the splash in the river to be big, it is necessary that the stone completely enters the water body, and then there will be many other factors that affect the waves and currents in it: the depth, slope, and temperature of the water; as well as the speed of flow, the shape of the stones and the structure of the river area.

How much money to they have after charging a 5% tax on a customer's total bill of $70? (Hint: This amounts to exactly $3.50 because the decimal in 5% is placed above the 5.)\nRationales: When the total bill is 70, we can use the equation: Total bill = 5%*Total bills\n\nWhen total bill =<70*5%=<<70*5%=3.5>>\n\n5% =$<<5%=3.5\n\nThe 5 cents is placed above the 4 for a total = < 3.5 >>3.5\n\nSince 3.5 is the answer we will round to the nearest dollar which is 4 dollars, so the total bill is $70+0.04 = $<<70+.04=70.04>>70.04\n\nAnswer: $\n\nAnswer: $4\n\n### Rationales: I know it sounds funny, but it is true!\n\n#### 4\n\n### Input Choices:  A - 50 B - 3 C - 5 D 4 E - 4 Answer: 4\n\n## Input:How many more cans of soup does Mary have than Bobby?

His dog, Daisy, eats three times her daily allowance in half an hour.  What fraction of Daisy's daily allowance does she eat when she has finished?\nRationales\nDaisy eats her allowance and the remainder of the hamburgers. If Daisy eats 3x her daily allowance, her allowance multiplied by 3 = <<D+3*a>>D and three ounces (1/16th pound) in half an hour. She eats 1/6 of her allowance in half an hours and 1/12 in the day, which is 1/6x365 = 0.606.

It can work at its fastest speed, and must travel north to move across the hole. It can travel at its fastest speed (1 mi/hour), or its slowest speed (0.5 mi/hour). The hole is 200,000 km long, and is located 1.4 M away from the nearest land (a small island in the Arctic). If it works at its slowest speed, how many years will it take to travel from the far side of the hole to the land near the hole.\nRationales: This problem has two steps to answer it:\n-Travel backwards 200,100 km(distance of the hole) in 1.4 Miles (distance to the small island). (201000000/(387000002)) < 0.0172 Miles/hour => 20100 * 5000 / 5\n-Travel backwards at 0.0168 Miles/hour\nThe distance is 2. If you can travel 2 miles in 1 day at 0.02 miles per hour, you can travel 32.19 miles in 181 Days (= 6 months) and 181 days = <<181=60.01>>60.01\nAnswer: 60.01 days\n\n### Input\n\n\n### Task\n### Input\n### Task:", "answer": "E: elevator"}
{"text": "Option: C\n\n### Instructions:What type of vehicle is typically used to deliver packages on Saturday?\n\n### Correct!\n\n### Input : A group of scientists have developed a new, inexpensive machine that can quickly identify the most efficient way to get from point A to point B.  The machine only costs $500.  However, for every additional route that they test, the machine needs to be re-calibrated.  The first time that they test the machine, they spend $1,000 to re-calibrate the machine.  Once the machine is re-calibrated, the scientists can test an infinite number of routes for the entire duration of the machine\u2019s lifetime.  The scientists test a single route as well as two further routes.  Each route, no matter how long the route is, takes exactly two hours to complete.  If the scientists test all three routes, how much money will they save by using the machine?\n\n### Rationales: The initial recalibration cost is $1,001.  By testing multiple routes, each test will save $500.\n\n#### 500x2=1000\n\nIf the cost of the initial recalibration was $1,005, then the savings from testing these three routes would be $1,002.\nIf they recalibrate one more time, they can test 15 more routes each costing $500. At that time, the savings would be $2,500.\nIf they re-calibrate one more, then they can test 16 routes for a total savings of $3,000.\n\n\n#### 2500\n\nAnswer: 3000 - 1001 - 1002 = 500,000\n\n### Correct\n\n### Instructors:Choices A, B, or D\n\nOption D\n\n### Input The city has just created a brand new park in the area.

There by we get 25, which is equivalent to 3*5, and we get a direct result.\n\n### Dividing by numbers other then 4\n\n## 25. What is 40%  of 4?\n\nLet us assume this is the equation, <x/10>*4 = <x%/10%>, \n\nLet us assume x=10,  therefore this is the equation,<10/10>*<4/10> = <10%/10%>.\nWe know, <10/10*4/10> < <10/1>*<4/>10>, and <1/10*1/10> <\nThese answers should be equivalent, thereby confirming this answer.\n\nRationales:\n\nAnswer: 1/5\n\n### 21.

The tens place is very large so you can subtract only 1 and the value will not be changed.  Another way is that if you count groups of 10, 100 and 1000 you can subtract only one or two times in most number of groups so we can get a wrong number.

The third is a sensor on the top center of a door and 3 motion sensors on the walls on the bottom corners (right corners) of each room in the house.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe sensor itself will be able to pick up a motion from the person as long as it is within that proximity range.\nIn the first scenario, you have to have a person standing in front of the motion sensor. This means a person will turn on the light first than break the code.\nIn the second scenario, an intruder has to break through the door frame before getting to the other motion sensors. The third scenario, you have 2 security motion sensors and 3 motion sensos. The person will have to break through a door and motion sensors in 3 rooms within the threshold range.\n\n#### Rationale:Sensor 3 = [0x72C029]\n##### Sensor 1 = [0x42C029:0x96C094:0x938335]\n##### Sensors 2 = [0x62C029::0", "answer": "D: proximity"}

You can drive to Ohio so therefore that would be a domestic product.\nB: Just because Washington State is part of the United States that doesn't mean that it wouldn't still be considered imported. If you were to drive to Canada then that would be an imported product.\nC: Alaska is located in the state of north america which is part of the United State so therefore that would be considered domestic, in order to be considered imported you would need to go outside of all of the states in North America which include Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and all of Central America and North America.\nD: Canada is in North America so therefore that would be an imported good or product.\nE: Flowers are not a food product but they are a plant so therefore that would be either domestic or a raw material. We don't know what the price is because we aren't informed or told the cost of the imported product so we can't determine whether or not it would be considered a domestic or imported product.\n\n### This is an instruction where students may be unfamiliar with the definition of a domestic product. Explain what the difference is between a domestic and an imported product.\nWhen you hear a domestic product, the word America comes to mind. But I think that domestic product means something that has been made in America. Something that has been manufactured, made, created, grown, and harvested within it's country, if its country is located in North America.\n\n### Give an example of a product that would be considered domestic and an imported product as well.\nIn the United States, a local farmer may grow vegetables and sell them at wholesale to your grocery store. The grocer would then be able to sell the produce in their store to the public. This is considered domestic because it was made in your country. I know that vegetables aren't a product but this is a good example.\n\nI can think of many examples but here are some. Things like cows. Farmers own them and harvest some for themselves and the rest they harvest and raise so that a grocery store can sell them. They grow them here in the United States not in England so therefore they are considered domestic. Same with wheat and corn. Farmers own them.

We're almost never able to determine such things through the use of deductive or inductive logic.\nGovernments that are both warlike and dictatorships have the distinction of fighting the longest wars of any government in history. They tend to go on indefinitely, usually as long as a country can afford it.\n\n### Input\nThe leader is a male. The people of the country are male.

You must provide both an explanation and a justification for each statement.\n### Solution:\n```Solution\n5 6\n\n1. 5 6 3 = 3 (5 6 3 x 1/5) = 3 (6 1/5)\n```\n### Justification: The numbers 5 and 6 will only yield one option if the denominator will only yield one option at it`s highest power, either 0 or 1. Here the denominator is 3 and 5 and 6 when raised to the denominator will both yield 1. If the denominator was less than 2 than we would have only been left with the option of 0. So the solution would be 3.\n\n### Below are math problems provided with a justification.

The problem that we have here is that you cannot divide a number by zero, because there is no division for zero and zero.  Our denominator is greater than 0, so it will always yield, or equal, greater than 0.\n### \n\n`8+8=16`\n\n`8-8=0`\n\n`6x6=36`\n\n`1-1=0`\n```", "answer": "A: blisters"}

Six of the apples are red.  There are seven different types of apples.  The first three types are orange, the next three are red, then there is green, then yellow, and finally there's a banana. How many types of apples are there?\nRationales The problem has 2 clauses:\n\n1. 24 apples\n\n2. 6 of them are red\n\nWhen you add 24+6, you get 30.\n\n3. There are 7 different types of apples: orange, red, green, yellow, and a banana. The question is asking, \"How many different types of apples are their (7)? Since the question is asking about the 7 types of apples, we also need to look at the 6 red apples. The 6 red ones are orange, red, red, red, and green. Since the 6 red ones are all orange, red, red...etc. it means there are 6 different red apples. The question is asking: \"How many types of orange, red, or green apples are there?\". We can put these apples in a line: orange, red, red........... This is where the 3rd clause comes in. There are now 3 different types of apples, so we get the answer from the first clause.  So now we get:  30+6=36\n\n#### 36\nAnswer: 36\n\nInput:  If 3 friends have chips in the ratio of 5:6:2, which friend has more? A) The one who started with 2", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

E is the speed up choice and B is living and A is crash. So therefore the answer is D. I think that because i looked in google and found what the cabin on the outside of the airplane was.\nAnd looked at the airplane I think that is also a good way to tell because D is also the slowest part or the part that is on air not that much.

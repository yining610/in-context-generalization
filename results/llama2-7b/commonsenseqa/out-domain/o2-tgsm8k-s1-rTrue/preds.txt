Where was Sam? Choices:  A: books B: france C: fish market D: atlantic ocean E: cuba<n>Output:		Sam was clearly in France<n>Since Paris is a city in France you know that Sam was not in the Atlantic Ocean or Cuba (since neither of those are countries and countries do not have the letter C in their names).  Sam was also not at a fish market or store in France, because then it wouldn't be a "sushi" place.  So you know that Sam clearly was at a sushi _place_, which is a restaurant.<n>You can also see in the question that you have to figure out where Sam was in Paris.  The options to choose are France, a fish market, the ocean, Cuba, and then a bookstore, which is the last option.<n>So you have to find a place in France that's a fish market and ask yourself what Sam ordered.  Then you'll realize Sam ordered Blowfish at a restaurant, and that he's clearly in Paris and not in France.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is NOT an animal that begins with Z?<n>Output: Fill in Zebra<n><n>Input: A pencil and a ____________ can be made out of the same wooden stump.

Choices:  A: russia B: at home C: hole D: field E: heaven<n>Output:		if we look at the pronunciations of the words  you see that they are not all similar.  You will never find a lemon in a hole and a lemon isn't something you put in a field either.  It's hard to think of a place to stay at home that starts in an H or an A that aren't also used to describe someplace you live, like  a home or hole.  If you were looking for this animal you would expect to be able to use different syllables  to describe the place your looking.<n>Since Russia starts with an R, it isn't that choice, since at home starts with A, you can't use it. Now if you think about the word field, at first it doesn't really ring any bells since it is a general word for something you would never associate a Lemur with being in.  A lemur is generally an animal that you would see in trees and the middle of the word field would never be applied to that type of animal.<n>So the final choice is E, as that would be the correct answer, and for those who didn't figure it out you can be satisfied by knowing that if you were looking for lemons a Hole would be the best place to look.<n><n>Input: I have a soccer ball that I can kick.

The gym does allow people to buy a membership if it is their first time using your gym.  It costs an extra $100 for the first time.  How much do you have left over?<n>Output:  You go 4 times a month and each time costs $20 leaving you with $20 + $20x4 = $40$40<n>Each month you pay $20 + $40 = $60$60 for your monthly membership and gym access<n>Then, each of the 1st 2 months that you go to the gym will cost you about $20 + $100+$100 = $140<n>So the last month you pay $40 for your monthly gym membership and all 4 months you spend $20 each time you go<n>You have $40-$140 = -$100 left over.

(That's 2.04 E+17) B: The sun is 1.414 E+11 kilometers in diameter. (That's also 1.41 E+11)<n>Answer:<n>We have to compare the two numbers according to the scale on which they are written. "E+17" means 10^17 and "E+11" means 10^{11}. In other words one hundred trillion, one hundred billion.<n>We also need to remove the unnecessary digits in the bigger number. The number is 2.0*10^{12}+ 17 (two billion trillion and seventeen)<n><n>The number we have to compare is 62 (two hundred and twenty)<n><n><n>To convert 2.04*10^12+17 into decimal, it will be like this: 2.0425999995 * 10^-12(2^-12)*17<n>As the number will be a very small fraction, it might not be possible to do the conversion. But, we can approximate it by approximating the big number in the numerator as well as the small number in the denominator: 2.0*2^-6*10^-12 (1% close)<n>So now the whole expression is 2.00157e-6 * 10^-06*10^-06 (close but again, not really close)<n><n>Similar approximation can be done to the smaller number: 20.017e-05 * 10^06 (close but not close enough)<n><n>To get a much much much close value, we would need to go to the next power of 10, which we can only do on a calculator. To do that, we need to multiply 20.17 * 10^-3. so we get: 0.20017*10^-4. And the next power of 2 to that is 2^-4 = 1/16. We can now approximate

How many cars do they need? Output:The answer is 6Input: A pond contains 8 fish. Every day, half of the fish die. The new fish are added back in to exactly replace those that died each day. For every fish removed, the total number of fish decreases by 99% (i.e. if there are 3 fish removed, there are now 0.75*3 = 2.25 fish left, which is now the total number). The pond will never run dry.  How many fish are in the pond at the end of 2 weeks? Output:We know the pond will run dry in 513 years, so<n><n>The total amount of fish in the pond can be written in two ways: 4004 or 8/3<n>So 4004+8=4012 which is the amount of fish at the end of 1 week. But since the number of fish decreased by 99%, there are 2.25 less fish than the original amount we added. Since the pond starts out with 8, the amount of fish at any point is 8-(513/7) = 8+/-0 + 8 /3 = 8 (which is the original amount minus the decrement factor for 2 weeks)4004 is the final number of fish after the 2 week period.<n><n>Input:  After Mary makes brownies for the party, she has 12 eggs.

You can get money when you buy stocks, but you do have to buy them and you can pay taxes and fees for purchasing stocks on your investment. Saving can be a very smart choice

There are buses that he could take to get to work, but he prefers to walk. He prefers to walk because he doesn’t like to be stuck in traffic. On the other hand, each bus might make him late for work. There are 5 buses that go to work. For each bus, he needs to weigh two factors: 1. the time spent getting to the bus stop; 2. the time spent waiting for the bus. For each bus, the time spent getting to and waiting for the bus is less than the time spent getting to work if he rides the bus. However, getting to work on time is more important to him: he doesn’t want to miss the start of his shift.<n>Output:The man should take bus 2. Busses 1 and 3 would mean that he has to drive to their stops, take the bus, then take the bus again and walk from the bus stop. Busses 4 and 5 would mean that after taking the bus to the depot, he would still have to drive to his depot, so there’s no shortcut and he’ll still be late. The best case scenario is if he drives and takes bus 2, which would save time and get him to work on time<n><n>#### Example answer:(He will drive and take bus 2)<n><n>Input:The man should take car 1.  Every other way is also impossible. (He should take a car that is closer because it save time)This man should take car 2 as well. (The man should take the easiest way to get to work )<n><n>#### Example answer((He should take car 1 and car 2 because they are the easiest))<n><n>Input:The girl who was supposed to go on the scavenger hunt found out yesterday that she can’t go.

If you travel at an average rate of 45 mph, what time should you leave the airport?<n>Output: Given current time and flight arrival time.  Let's assume current time is 4:55 with flight arrival time at 5:00.  You have to leave the airport before 5:00 so let's say 4:50 departure time.  At 4:50 you will be going at 4:50 speed.  So at 5:01 you will be taking the flight which takes the rest time 1 minute to arrive your final destination.  At 5:05 you are at the airport and it's going at 4:00 speed.  <n>So total time for destination plus flight time is 4:05+1=5:06+1=5:86<n>From destination to airport is 64 miles and at 4:05, you will go at 4:04 speed.  So 64/4:05 = 64/4 = 16 minutes<n>64/4 +6 = 20 minutes left for airport to pick you up.<n>So the time to leave airport is 4:50 - 20 = 4:30<n><n><n>

Those may be parked due to repair or maintenance, stored away in hangars as they wait to be used or are in crashed from when they failed or lost. Aircraft carrier is a ship used to launch fighter airplanes and not aircrafts. These are therefore not "not being used". War related things are not a direct and immediate use of aircrafts so they can be disregarded. And aircrafts use air and not water so they can't use a ship either. Finally, the crash is the most simple and logical among other answers. So the final answer was choice E: that is to say, crash.<n><n>Input:There are a 4 students with an average age of 13.3.

Choices:  A: detroit B: australia C: michigan park D: cafe E: retail store<n>Output:		We only buy in Michigan Park.<n><n>Input:We have 25 students in our program. We have a certain amount of seats in the classroom. If students sit in the front of a classroom, they have less of an opportunity to learn as everyone can see them. If they sit in the back, they have an easier time learning. If we have too many students to fit in a classroom, we have to break up some into two sections. If we have too few students for two sections, we don't waste money on hiring extra staff.<n>Output:If we have 25 seats and 52 students want to take the class, we can fit 8 students per section if they were all on opposite sides of the classroom. If we had 72 students, we would fit 16 students per section if they switched side of the classroom every two days. If we had 26 students, we would have to split the class with 13 students per section.<n><n>##Explanation:<n>In the first exercise, Zach currently has $65, his weekly allowance is 5 and he mows the laundry for $10 and then he babysits and earns 14 dollars that day. Add $29 to his current $65 he has to save to have $94 dollars. In mowing the laundry, he earned an extra 10. With Babysitting, he earned an extra $4. To answer the question, Zach needs to earn as much as $100-65 dollars. Since he has already earned $94 dollars, Zach should save $100-90 dollars. His answer should be 10.0568019123172.<n><n>In the second exercise, we have 25 students but only 25 seats. Since in the back of the classroom we would be better off learning than in front of it, the students that are 25 seats would be the maximum amount of seats we can fit per section. With 25 students in one section and no extra classroom seats, we would have to have two classes to make our education fair. However, if we have 52 students in one classroom, we can break them up into two sections per classroom.<n><n>In the third exercise, we have 52 seats and

The town needs to build a replacement bridge, but doesn't have enough money to do so. Therefore, the town council has decided to hold a benefit walk.  A benefit walk is an event in which people must pay to participate, and the money is given to a good cause.  The event is going to take place over two days and will go from 9AM to 5PM, the time at which each day will end. Everyone who participates can go over the bridge one time only. The walk begins and ends in the town square, so the path is the town square, the bridge, and then the town square again. How much money will be raised?<n><n>Output: The answer is 4559.00<n>We can figure it out by using this: Since it is a double-day event, we need to assume that it is the same for both days. Each person can cross the bridge only once (so if 5 people cross the bridge once, they can leave). So each time someone crosses the bridge, no one else crosses it until the next person crosses the bridge.  On the first day, 30 people cross the bridge and 15 are left to cross on the second day. The second day, 45 people

C is not the answer because it does not fall on or touch the east coast.  You would not want to go to FL on the east coast anyways because it would put you on the other side of the Gulf so it wouldn't be east in relation to you.  C and D aren't even near each other, which means that those answers are incorrect, leaving us with choices A or B.<n>Since B was the capital of MA and a seafood restaurant can be anywhere, we can't really answer this question, leaving us with choice A<n><n>

It should be more clear and easier to read.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the follow-up question<n><n>You should make the program more efficient.  You can create two data structures instead of a single one.  You can also use the while loop to process through the values sequentially instead of with multiple if-else statements.  As a final recommendation, you should create an auxiliary function (not part of the original algorithm) to handle your if-conditionals.  Additionally, you can create a function that will return a string representation of the output.  Finally, the use of a do while loop instead of a while loop will allow you to better control the flow.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>Input: Mary added a total == 45 of 42 stickers to her journal, which leaves her with 44 stickers.<n><n># Instruction:Answer questions 8 and 9<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input-> 6 hours<n>Output-><n>240 minutes<n><n>## # Instruction:Answer questions to 8 and 9 by making an arithmetic expression for each.<n><n>Input: 33/9

Two students want to be considered a team.  The team with the highest grade will win.  There is extra funding if each team has more than 3 students.  This extra funding is distributed at 60% per team, and 40% per student.  How many student teams will win funding?<n>Output: To use the Funding, we cannot have all students be on the same team because not enough students would be together to divide the funding equally as well as each student wouldnt get even distribution.  If we have 4 students as shown, 4 each get $0 and 2 each get $20.  But if there is 5 students, 2 are in each team and 2 are by themselves.  If there is $x students, 2 get $20 each.  For $x-2, each team gets $30 and each person on the team gets $15.  So, we need at least 5 students (not 4) and at least 60% of the students who get funding are together as a team.  Since our answer is 2, we do not give the extra funding, so what we get is 2*60% = 2*0.6 = 1.2  Our total funding is 2*40% = 2x0.4 = $0.8.  After we add in the funding we gave to each student, the students in team of $1 get an extra $1.600.6=$1.16/1.60 and the students in $2 get an extra $4.801.16=$3.96/1.6 and each get $7.82.<n><n>

Choices:  A: empowering B: regret C: despair D: glee E: sadness<n>Output:		 I guess "joy" is not an acceptable option.  So A is the right answer here. So C is not a good answer, because people cannot do bad or evil things without first having evil intentions. They cannot sin without first sinning; they cannot lie without first lying. In fact, Jesus said, "A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit." (Matt 7:18) So you can't have your actions causing harm and still be good. "Cause" implies a direct force or action. And if that force or action causes harm, there's no "joy" in it. The only other options are regret or despair; regret is a bad feeling because you did bad things (regretting you did bad). Despair is more like, well, despair: it's the "depressing lack of hope," like when you have no hope that a wrongdoing will change. So the answer is regret.

Choices:  A: under bed B: symphony C: music room D: band practice E: music store<n>Output:		A=under bed<n>We will look at each answer:<n>C. Music room: If someone has a music room, they already have the instrument. They are most likely not going to move it.<n>E. Music store is a bad location because you will have to carry it inside.<n>B. Symphony: you can keep it in a different place but you might not have enough money to keep paying for concerts. There is also a chance that you will run out of space very quickly and no one else in your house will like it.<n>D. Band practice. Band practice means you will have to be able to hold the instrument for around an hour per day and also have enough time to play it every day. You also need to store it somewhere else so you can store it outside as you probably cannot play an instrument in a loud space.<n>A. Under bed is the best answer because:<n>1.

(Note this assumes the 13 people are adults and can tolerate more intoxicating spirits; for children, you'd have to reduce the alcohol portion by at least half or more).<n>Input:Gordon'  house is in the shape of two parallelograms. The first parallelogram measures 8 feet long and 6 feet wide. The second measures 9 feet long and 6 and a half feet wide.  He sold the first parallelogram and bought a television to put in the space  it used to be.  His house now measures 7 and a half feet by 6 feet.  What are the dimensions of Gordon's house now?<n>Output:Let x and x' be the dimensions of his house. We're told that the second parallelogram measures x feet on the long side and (x+.5) feet on the short side. Thus, x-=.5. Similarly, the short side of the second parallelopath measures x' feet. x+.5+x'=8, so 2(x+.5)+x'=9. Since this holds for both the parallelograms, we can simply add them to get a total of x +x'=.5 feet in between the two sides of the house. Thus, the dimensions of Gordon' house now are 5 and 6 feet.<n>

Choices:  A: measure distance B: england C: office D: drawer E: desk<n>Output:		Choices:<n>A:  (100 points): You could definitely find a multiple ruler that belong to different people in an office. When engineers are working at the office, they will often work in a group on a certain project and each member of the group would probably own their own ruler.<n>B: (100 points) You could definitely find a ruler that belongs to different people in England. King of England used to make a law where everyone was required to own a ruler. So, if you go to a museum in England, you would probably be able to find tons of rulers that belong to different people.<n>C:  (50 points): You would also be able to find a multiple ruler in a drawer because of the following reasons.  Everyone has their own desk, but the desk might be shared with another person. For example, a student would have their own desk but then share the desk with 2 of their friends. So, the students might each own a ruler and use their own ruler to measure distance. The multiple ruler theory works in this situation because the students can all use their own ruler. <n>If you take the student example from above and apply it to a company, multiple rulers can be found in a drawer where you have employees that are each working on their own project. The multiple ruler works there because each employee would each have their own desk and use their own rulers to measure distances/lengths in their project.<n>D:  (50): You would definitely be able to find multiple rulers on a desk because a single ruler can represent many people. If I own my own desk and then another person that I know shares the desk with me, I can use one ruler to represent my own and theirs.<n>E:  (0 points). A desk is one table that belongs to one person. So, the ruler should belong to at least 2 people to make it possible. If I only have 1 ruler and I share the ruler with someone else, the other person must have their own ruler with them.

Ink spilled onto her old one.  Really, she didn't know what that thing had an inkwell in the first place.  What piece of furniture might have been on her run? Choices:  A: front of door B: bedroom C: desk D: table E: living room<n>Output:		Letters from the word "Rug" (R,U,G in alphabetical order) begin with the 2nd, 1st and 4th letter of the alphabet.  Thus a logical guesser would guess a "R" might be on the run.  So option B and E are both good choices since they involve a bedroom and "Run" (RUN = "R" U "N").<n><n>Input:Brittany wants to borrow a truck.  How much does she need to borrow? Input:A car costs $5000, a moped costs $1000.  A truck costs $8000.  Brittany has $2000 that she can use to buy a truck.  She has $3000 left to buy a truck but she plans to borrow $2000.  How much will she have left over for personal savings?<n>Output: Let's use $8000 be the base price for a truck. For a moped, $1000 is $2000/2= 1000/2. So for truck, $100,000/2 would be $500000.<n>$2000 is also 1/10 of the base price<n>Let's figure out how much she will have left over after she borrows: $10*2000=$20,000<n>So for personal savings, she will have a minimum amount of $3000-$20,00= <<3000-20000=7000>>4800.<n><n>Input: 124486436 1244968<n>Output: 90000 is the answer<n><n>Input:30 1208<n>Output:100 is the answer.<n><n>Input:Rent Apartment 1261 6.475<n>Output:8.4 is the answer.<n>

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: study french cooking C: taste sauce D: prepare food E: thin sauce<n>Output:		All the choices are wrong, except maybe taste sauce.<n><n>Input:A: cook dinner: Taste is a verb B: study french: No, study isn't a verb. C: prepare food: Prepare has the verb eat in it. D: thin sauce: To thin would be an adjective. So it would be A: taste sauce.<n>It is the wrong answer because there is no mention of how the sauce tastes.<n><n>Input: Which choice could you make if you want to taste food all of the time?

B: Taste sauces: If you taste the sauce, you will then enjoy it while eating it. Tasting the sauce and then preparing the food, are two different things.  (Not C. Prepare doesn't contain the verb eat.  C is incorrect.) D: Thin sauces: Thin is an adjective (not a verb, so it is ruled out from A).  (Not E. Dinner doesn't contain the word taste. Therefore it could not involve a verb.) E: Cook dinner: This also does not involve the verb, so there is no way to involve the verb during dinner.

Now, it is time to draw random numbers.  In this exercise, we will use the rand method to draw random numbers without displaying them.  Below in the code, we have a function named rnd.  We start with rand(0, 10), which returns a between 0 and 10, inclusive. Then we create a loop and change rand(0,10) to a variable, i.  rand(0 10) is a value (i.e. 1, 2, 3,...) but never returns that value directly.  In the loop, i changes for each iteration, so rand() will return a random number every pass through the loop. We display this number in a print statement, and the loop terminates when the value of i equals our random number, 5.<n><n>##### Code:<n>RandomNumber=randint(0,100)<n>if RandomNumber = 5:<n>    print('You won! Good Job')<n>    break<n><n>##### Output:<n>You won!<n><n>RandomNumber=rand(0, 12)<n>if RandomNumber=2<n>print('you won!')<n>elif RandomNumber > 15<n>print ('You won!')<n><n>##### Output<n>You won! Good Job<n>You won!<n>You won!<n>### Exercise 4- A:<n>##### Question: Modifying the Code: In exercise 4, we used randint to generate random numbers. In this exercise, we'll take the results of a random number and modify the result so

Choices:  A: turn away B: let down C: have to sleep D: run E: row boat<n>Output:		C: Have to sleep<n>Human powered water transportation consists of water vessels that are propelled primarily by muscle power, instead of steam (steam powered) or motors. These vessels are usually used for coastal and intercoastal water travel because of their relatively low speed limits compared to motorized water vessels.<br>There are two main types of human powered water craft: sailboats and row boats. These two types of boats differ in the number of sailors and the type of sail used. <br>Sailboats have sails, a triangular-shaped cloth, attached to a horizontal surface (mast) that moves the wind to propel the sailboat forward. They are operated by a person, or team of persons, on the deck. These boats also use oars, long poles, to steer the craft in specific directions. <br>Row boats do not use sails, however, they can still achieve considerable speeds. These boats use long oars to move the boat forward. These long oars are able to be rowed with one or several persons on board.<br>In general, all these humans powered water crafts either use oars or sail, both of which can be rowed.<n><n>

Choices:  A: revealing information B: being ridiculed C: problems D: more funding E: telling all<n>Output:		The choices are a, b, c, d, and e  One means to get more money to expand or finance the company's projects. For this to be a possibility, a company must go public, allowing people who are interested in the company to purchase "shares" of the company's stock.  Another reason is that investors want to know the inner workings of companies.  Many go public because they do not want to be ridiculed. As long as they are going through the proper steps of "telling all", this will be irrelevant.<n><n>Input: Choices: A: in the past B: for the future C: both D: none<n>Output: As far as "later", you know that it is going to be later, but it doesn't necessarily tell you when.  When you see the word "today" it means that it is happening right now.  When you see "yesterday", it means that it already happened (you are talking about something that happened the day before yesterday, yesterday, and/or the day before).  The one that doesn't make sense is "tomorrow".  The word "tomorrow" can mean either the next day to come or tomorrow, the word that you should be putting on the "later" line.<n><n>Input: If a girl is 17 years old, when will she be 18 years old?<n>Output: Girls reach double on their birthday!

How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:The window across the street was broken and John felt guilty. He never meant to damage what? Choices:  A: friend's house B: curtains C: space shuttle D: front door E: classroom<n>Output:		The answer is C, Space Shuttle. Since there's no specific classroom, we assume that the question refers to the classroom as a whole, and, thus, the entire building.<n><n>Input: John's teacher took him to the library today.  He has <<100>>books in his library class.  Which choice represents 80% of his library? Choices: A: 76 books B: 80 books C: 114 books D: 104 books E: 111 books<n>Output:The correct answer is option C.<n><n>Input: A dog has bones in his basket.  His basket hold 16 bones.  A dog does not have <<16>>bones.  A dog has <<6>>bones. The dog wants more bones. How many bones does the dog want?<n>Output:In the statement, 6 can also be read as '5+1'; and therefore, option B is correct, 5+1=6, and so he wants 5+1=<<6>>6 bones.<n><n>Input:Which of the following are even numbers? A) 51 B) 403 C) 12 D) 40<n>Output:The four numbers given are: { 40, 51, 12, 403}<n><n>Since 40 is even, 12 is even, but 403 is odd and 51 is odd. Therefore, the answer is B, even numbers.<n><n>Input: Which number is greater, 5/7 or 7/10? A. 5/7 B. 5/7 C. 7/10 D. 7/14 E. 7/11<n>Output:The answer should be choice (D): 7/10.<n><n>Since 5/7 > 7/10, choice (A) is not correct.<n><n>We cross out (B), because:<n><n>5/7 = 5<n><n>7/10 = 7/10<n><n>Since 5 > 7, choice (C) is not correct. This leaves us with choice (D): 5/7 >7/10. Therefore, choice (D): 6/10 is the answer.

Your dad eats 16 apples. How many apples do you have now?<n>Output: Your brother ate 8 apples, leaving 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>><n>Your dad ate 16 apples and you have 32 - 16 = <<32-16=16>><n>You now have 32 - (8+16) = <<32-24=8>><n><n>Input: A bookstore has 12 25% off cards, 10 50% off cards, and 9 75% off cards. If you have 45 82% off cards, how many 35% off cards will you need to buy for the same total amount as these cards?<n>Output: If one card is worth 82% of a total of 45 then they are also worth 35% of the same total of 18.  Since 82% is equivalent to 35%, so one must be 35% of 150.  A 35% off card is 35% of a book's cover price.  So you need exactly 1 35% off cover price to pay for the same total as the 82 off cards.<n><n>Input: A farmer sold  a total of 138 eggs in each of 8 batches for $15.39 each.

Choices:  A: damage B: cloud mind C: lower i.q D: cause illness E: cause accidents<n>Output:		Drugs affect memory and motor skills.  When a drug affects memory or motor skills, it impairs a person's ability to think and control their mind and behaviors. These short term changes can lead to long term effects on a person. Drugs also cloud mind. Mind clouding is a short term side effect, which results in memory loss and loss of awareness of surroundings. This is usually associated with alcohol and other depressants. Cause illness is not the problem because these drugs have temporary or permanent side effects that can lead to disease and death. Disease, such as heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, can be a result of harmful behavior when addicted to drugs and living lifestyle due to drug addiction, especially in the case of substance abuse.

Choices:  A: circus B: carnival C: surprise D: spoons E: party<n>Output:		The man went to clowning college, but he always wanted to run away with the party.<n>The clue was that he went to the circus, which means clown college.  A is not the same as circus B is not the same as the circus and surprise is different than all of these.  His college had a circus so it is the circus.  The clue also told us he wanted to run away with it.  We cannot select C or D because they are nouns and we wanted a verb like wanted to escape with.  Choice E should not be selected as it is a verb and party does not answer anything.  This is a noun. So choice A is correct.<n><n>Input: A:  A: The man is my best friend.  B:  The man is my friend.<n>Output: The man is your best friend.<n>The man is a noun.  B: is a verb.  Best is an adjective that is used to describe someone or something in a good way.  Friend is also an adjective which means you have the same interest, goals, or opinions.  It is also a noun.  Best friend is used as an adverb.

A ritual involves taking part in a set of actions that are regarded as symbolically important or significant. These actions could be physical, verbal, or both. In some traditions the egg is often given as a gift to wish someone good health and peace or it could signify the presence of the spirit of spring as it is seen as a symbol. The egg symbolism in Christianity has its roots in the Biblical story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is believed that the egg laid at Easter represents renewal of life with the coming of spring. If it was Easter egg hunting was popular in England in 1878 thanks to Count Apponyi of Hungary who brought the custom to England after hearing about it in France. The first Easter egg hunt in England happened in the Great Park at Windsor and that was where people chased eggs. On a historical note, an egg is a symbol of the Spring that represents resurrection and fertility. Another reason the man gave the chocolate cake to the man as a gift for his birthday could be that he wants to celebrate his birthday in a special way and make his day happy and memorable. He might be planning on having a special dinner out with family and friends or even go out of town on vacation to celebrate. Easter egg hunting was introduced among the upper classes of the society in the United States in the 19th century but didn’t catch on. Chocolate Easter eggs became popular in the United States by 1860. The tradition of painting and hiding Easter eggs is believed to have originated in Mesopotamia.<n><n>### The only answer that works here:  B<n><n>Input: The woman was taking her daughter to school when she realized that she had forgotten the lunch box.

This is a day of rest so she can only speak to welcome the guests The next person to speak is the guest who arrives next, so it has to one of the males.  This is also a day of rest but the men were not at home so the second person does not speak  Since they do not speak we can assume that they are brothers because a brother is always with his brother on the first and last days of his B.Y. calendar The first brother then has to speak the next time someone says something because everyone else has already spoken.  This brother then tells all the guests to say thank you to the hostess for hosting them The next person to speak cannot be a girl nor the next brother since they have already spoken as well as the last person to speak  The last person to speak is in fact the first brother's wife and she says thank you to the host for having them over   Since they are done speaking everyone else is welcome to say whatever they want and when they do the riddle is over<n><n>Input: Alice wants to be a mathematician.

Choices:  A: india B: hole C: cage D: habitat E: rain forest<n>Output:		Native lemurs live in the Amazon River rain forest<n>While there are several different animals called lemurs in the wild, only two species of lemur reside in India and each comes from a different region of India.  These two animals are actually from different families of animals and could not possibly be called the same thing.<n>Of the four choices above, the native lemur could be represented by either the Cage or the Habitat choice.  Each comes from a different part of a rainforest in a different country. A Lemur cage is a separate enclosed room in the zoo and does not contain just lemurs.  A habitat could be just a section of the rainforest that contains lemurs, or it could also mean that a group of lemurs resides in the same area.<n>A native lemur is not found in a hole (they do not make their dens underground) nor do they live in a city or anywhere else that is not a rain forest, so the other three choices are eliminated. The lemur habitat requires trees which means that the lemur would be found in the Amazon (rain forest, not river). Because rainforests tend to grow in tropical and sub-tropical places, they are typically found in South America.  Therefore the correct answer is E<n><n>14. Choose the correct verb conjugations.<n><n>Input: 1. Nous voyagerons en France. Nous allons nager pendant un an. Nous irons aux Etats Unis.<n>2. Nous irons la lune demain. C'est très jolie<n>Output:<n>2. Nous allons la lune demander.<n>3. Nous allons les états unis.<n><n>Instructions: The verb conjugation in numbers 1 and 2 is missing. The verbs used are the French verbs voyager and nager. In number 3, the verb nous irons aux Etats unis is correct. Nous irons is correct for number 4, even though this sentence is in French.<n><n>In number 1, voyager is the verb but the French word used is irons.  The verb "to be", etre, should be used to create the correct conjugation to go in the sentence.  We then substitute the word irons in place of voyager to create the correct answer.<n>Nous allons etre en

It has to do with proceedings, as court case.  But Civil Action refers to an American legal drama, (based on the book The Civil Action: Anatomy of an Industrial Disaster, by Jonathan Harr)  that depicts a court trial, trial.

Each student must take a midterm exam. There is a total of 180 points for the exams. All of the scores in are scaled so, that the smallest value is 10. The scoring is done as follows. A student takes 90 points off the top for the lowest score and then 10 points off for each additional point scored. The maximum number of points a student can score is 400. Each student scores 140 points on the exam. How many students must take the exam?<n>Output: 17 students which is 11 greater than the original 16. To receive a 400 (150-150), 16 people would have to have to have 400 points. (Based on the problem itself, we can assume that there would be at least some grade above 140. So this problem would have to repeat itself 16X more for the maximum of 400 to be reached.) This means that 228 points need to be removed. So 17 is the answer.<n><n>Input: How many pages does the document have? Choices:

If someone is looking to write a resume, they should ask for help from a writer, teacher, or someone with great handwriting.<n>

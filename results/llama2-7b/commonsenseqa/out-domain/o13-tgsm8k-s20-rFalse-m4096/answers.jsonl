We need to subtract 1 from every unit digit until we get to 40404, a number with no 4's. (So, by subtracting one from every unit digit, we are getting closer and closer to 404)\n\nOur next step is to subtract 1 from 404, which can be shown as 404 - 1 = 403.\n\nNext, we need to subtract 1 again from every unit digit. For example, 403 - 1 = 392.\n\nThen we subtract 1 again. For example 392 - 1 = 291\n\nNext step is to subtract 4 as an addition to your next unit digit. For example 291 + 4 = 300\n\nIf 300's unit digit is 3, we will subtract 1 from 3 and continue with our pattern. For example, 300 - 1 = 029\n\nSo, after subtracting another 1 from 029, we get 129.\n\nThe final number is 129. \nOutput: 129\n\nInput : Alice's age=30; Betsy's age=60; The average age of Alice and Betsy=40; Betsy is 4 years older than Alice; Therefore, Alice's age=Betsy/((Betsy-60)/4); (Betsy is 60 because 120-60=60)", "answer": "A: look at"}

We're going to try to help you learn about a simple kind of programming called loops. These patterns can help you code more efficiently. There is one, two, maybe, many, and all, but one is your new favorite. All you need to do is put the answer to a question into the answer box, and then click submit when you're done. Your job and mine is to find a way to help you answer the questions within a loop. So we can't make the answer box, or we can't make you click submit. You're the one doing the work. My job is to try to help you to do that work more quickly and efficiently by giving you some hints, but it's your decision on how to use those hints. So, a question is asked. If you don't get it, put something in the answer box and we'll look at it. If you do get it, great. You can keep going. If we're at some point near the end where you just haven't done a problem, you're a little stuck, put something in the box. Maybe something that's closer to an answer, then maybe something else. We'll look at it, see what we can figure out, and then we'll keep going. So let's see what you've got. Who's", "answer": "E: may laugh"}

Relaxing the jaw, neck, shoulders, chest, legs and lower back helps reduce the possibility of restlessness, thereby promoting a more restful sleeping pattern.\n\n#### B: Dreams\nDreams can cause restlessness for a variety of reasons. If your dream is too vivid and you are reliving an intense event in your memory, you may have nightmares. The event may be a traumatic memory triggered by an intense thought or action that happened recently. If you had recently experienced a traumatic event, you may struggle with nightmares after the event. Dreams can be restless sleep as well.\n\n#### C: Have nightmares\nYou sleep more comfortably if you have a good night's rest. This can lead to more hours of uninterrupted sleep, as well as more efficient workdays and more energy at work.

Choices: 2: 25 3: 524 4: 2450031 5:245\nOutput: 245\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\nTIP: You may find the 52-card deck problem useful for this question\n\n### My Answer:\n\nThe first question is easy and follows the logic we just saw in the previous question. So we go with option B i.e 16.\n\nThe second Question follows the same logic but only this time, we calculate how many years and how many days the baby at that age. This means that the number of human years it has lived, is calculated by multiplying the number of human years with the number of days it stayed alive. So we go with 14 i.e 15x365.\n\nAnther common question type is the logical deduction and one of those is the finding the remainder when a number is divided by another number. We saw it in the 52-cards problem and we saw it once again here. So the answer is B but not the answer to the question.\n\nSo we have 225495494 which is the number of dogs in the first and the second division. And we have 161608484 which is the number obtained after adding 3. So we go with Option B i.e option D.\n\nOne question that can be confusing is a math question that has several equations or several variables that we have to solve by plugging the variables in the equations. Well this question is somewhat similar but the answer lies in your logic than it lies in your math. I would say that the answer lies between the middle and the left options.", "answer": "D: theater"}

A baby jaguar is called a cub, not a kitten. The name jaguar comes from the indigenous word for jaguar.  The animal's scientific name, Panthera onca, comes from the scientific Latin name for panther.

The answer will be 60.\n\nThe third question is a bit trickier. If you're going to solve this one, probably the most important thing to note is that the maths in question marks will always be different than the maths in commas.\n\nThe fourth question is really basic maths. Just work out the amount of birds you have, and then the amount that you have left after you sell them. Then add them together in your head (or on paper if you can't) and you'll get the answer straight away.\n\nThe fifth question is easy, just think logically. You don't know how many they sell. So you need to think how much you had left initially. You're lucky that this question doesn't ask 'How many you had", "answer": "C: deny"}

The first step is to add all of the numbers to have 3 digits, for example by adding one + four + three to get 8.  Then from there you do 8 - 9 and 8 will be divided by 7 and the remainder will be 1.  And then the remainder from dividing seven into ten has to be added to the number and 2 will be subtracted from the original number, for example, adding 1 to seven, then subtracting two, will give you eight.  And then the next step is to multiply by every number and add the product.  First multiply by one and then two and four and then eight which gives you 8x1, 8x2, 8x4, 8x8 which is what I got from the end.\nOutput: 80,160\n\nInput: One year of a dog' s life equals 15 years of a human life, two years of a dog' s age equals 9 years of a human's life, then every year after that equals 5 years of a human' s life.

The formula for interest on a loan is I = PRT(A/B). For example, 18% (Note B is negative, because you are taking interest) divided by 5 (number of weeks) gives 18/5=3.6. 3.6 times $1600 gives 7360 and multiplying by 3 gives $22,160. This is the final balance of the loan. We also know the interest rate is 7360/1600 = 4.625 rounds to 4.63 (again with the negative sign in numerator). You get $20,624.17 as final answer.\n\nInput: An apple and a banana cost 1.50 at the store. A bag of apples costs 6.99, while a bag of bananas costs 4.99.

This question is incorrect\n\nInput:The formula for calculating the average (arithmetic mean) is (n + 1) / 2 in the form of a fraction.  Therefore 20, 18 and 8 are equivalent.  How do you show that 20, 21, 8 are equivalent?\nOutput:  In order for 20 + 21 + 8 to be the same as (20*2 + 20 + 11 + 20) (18 + 18 + 8 + 18), we need to have 3 * 2 = 6 which means the sub-totals of 20 + 8 + 8 and 20*2 +20 + 18 +8 must be the same as each other.  Thus, we must have 24 + 16 = 30 + 28 which reduces to 4 + 16 or 16-4.  Thus, 20 + 7 + 8 = 20 * 2 + 18 + (18 + 8) = 20*4 + 16 + (18 + (16+8)) = 80 + 16 + 24 = 120.\n\nInput: The formula for calculating the mode for random numeric values is the most frequently occurring number in the group.

She has traveled with her family from California to attend an event at Washington National Cathedral. In the middle of the night, Caroline's brother Patrick falls ill due to an ear infection. Caroline has a toy, a bunny named Bun Bun, that she brings with her everywhere she goes. Caroline brings Bun Bun to the local pharmacy, and the pharmacist calls their mother to ask her when she will be back to pick it up. On the same phone call, Caroline accidentally overhears two boys from the same class as hers, discussing the name Caroline Kennedy. The boys call her \"Kate Smith,\" after a popular singer, and sing the song, \"Daisy.\" She also overhears a doctor explain to her mother that her brother's ear infection is very serious. After finding out, Caroline and the rest of her family become very worried: her mother faints when she learns the news, her father does his best to comfort her mother, and she herself becomes extremely scared of the doctors in Washington DC. When Caroline calls her cousin Nancy Gibbs to explain her situation, Nancy gives this advice to her: \"Caroline, don't worry, I'm sure they'll take care of it. Besides, you know you've had chickenpox, right?\" To which Caroline replies, \"No, not yet!\" Then Caroline decides to stop by her best friend's house on her way home.

At the hospital, the doctors can't figure out why the ear infection has taken an especially bad turn. Finally, they tell Caroline and her mother that it's an especially virulent form of chickenpox.  The doctors give her some antibiotics to take home so that they can control Caroline's chickenpox infection. The next day, Caroline feels slightly better and tells her mother to get a haircut for her.

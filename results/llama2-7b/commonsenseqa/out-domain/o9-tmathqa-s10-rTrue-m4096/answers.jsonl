I'll be able to tell you if you can clear this up a bit.\" \n\"OK, here's the logic to show that it is false.  The statement is saying that there are more sides than the number of sides that a triangle can contain, which is 3.  If the statement said anything different (e.g. it said that it is possible to have 4 sides in a triangle, or that it was possible to have a 3-sided triangle with more than 4 sides, etc.). then it would be true (the number of 4-sided sides in a triangle would equal or exceed the number of sides a triangle can have, or be equal or exceed the number non-equilateral 3-sided sides a triangle can have; these are mathematically the same condition, which would make the set of triangles with 4 sides equal or contain a) a larger subset of triangles b) a larger triangle than a subset of triangles c) all triangles d) a superset of triangles e) all triangles that contain only a subset of the triangles that contain 4 sides, i.e. all triangles, plus possibly some unrelated triangles e.g. 3 triangles.  Therefore, the statement is false.\"\n\"It's clear that'some' is referring to the general statement.\"\n\"OK, how about the question 'are there more than four sides in a triangle?'\"\n\"No, 'are there more' implies that there is an actual number of sides present in a triange in general, and the general answer is 'no there is not'\"\nInput: I see what you mean by that, but you're missing my point.

{"idx": 154, "text": "\"Choice D: Rising interest rates as long as the price in real terms is not going up because the interest rate has to be higher than the inflation it can not be negative but inflation it increases the wages more to keep the price of goods and services low even with inflation if you don't keep the wages low you are increasing the cost of living because that is what increases the interest rate. Example - with 10 percent inflation pay increases of 8 percent are required to keep the inflation 0 at least for the worker it matters if the inflation will be at least keep low, so he feels richer than really he is. But if the price go up he will feel poorer even he is getting the bigger pay increase. But if you are a capitalist that is not the case you just want to see the money because you have already put much more as a savings but when the wages go up you loose on interest because you don't get the interest rate of your money because they adjust to the price go up. You keep the wages low because the interest rate and the price in real terms will stay low. If everyone have a good savings he can just use the savings and invest it to make money and pay it again, to keep the interest rate and the real price go down and keep you well above 0 inflation because now that everyone are investing the money will go up at a much faster real rate of interest that is to keep low inflation so keep the price low, and it is better to borrow money to pay the loans to keep low interest rate because it goes down so you can be ahead and make money as you pay back with the lower interest rate.\nSo the answer is D ( Rising interest\"\n\n\n## Instruction:\n\nThe instructions here would be similar to the problem \"find the largest number without repeating\".

It never crosses their minds to carry something in with them to use instead of their car. \"How do I carry my groceries?\" \"How do I transport my kids?\" and \"How do I get something from upstairs?\" always seems to cross the mind of every single human being on this planet except drivers.\n\nB: Drivers have this terrible habit of believing that the laws are different for them. \"There are NO tickets being issued this close to XMAS - I can move there just fine!\" or \"The officer HATES me! If I move just a little too far, he's definitely going to ticket me... I don't even need to see that it's a cop.\" or \"I can't help it!

Sometimes, it's cold, sometimes it's raining, sometimes I have to drive all the way back to get the groceries, whatever.

And yet this problem is so well understood that even by analyzing its simplest version, we arrive at the solution.\nWe're talking about life, or rather, the meaning of life!\nIf a 99-year-old person is considered to be \"old,\" how old is someone who is half their age?\nPlease type your solution below. Solution:\nIf, by \"old,\" you mean physically older, i.e. half the age of \"99,\" then the person is 49 years old.\nIf, however, you mean that this person is \"old\" because they are half the age of the previous generation, then, since a single generation lasts 20 years, the 99-year old is (99-20) = \"old\" because half of their generation is dead, and the new generation has been around for half their lives.\nTherefore, the 99 year old is (1-2/5/20-19) = (1-0.8)/(15-14)= \"old\" because 80% of their generation has died but they too will die soon, thereby releasing the next generation. And so on so that \"old\" just passes from one generation to another, but \"young\" stays the same!\nThe interesting part is that someone who is 1-half the age of \"young\" is 1-half that number so they're one year younger than \"young\".\nTo avoid confusion in case anyone else has any other definition of \"old\", it will be safe to assume that this means physically old.\nBoth of my parents are older than my generation. As far as I'm concerned, they are young because the age difference with myself is just about a whole generation.\nInput: The number of times that a person in a specific region will blow kiss to the number if person in that region is equal to their", "answer": "E: erections"}

For this to be a feasible task, the problem statement has to define exactly what is an input and what is an output; and how to parse inputs and outputs (which is not always simple).\n\nIn this case, there is a mix of textual inputs and questions, and what is output and what input is not always clear, especially to start. Here's an example of where it's not clear.\n\n\\begin{code}\nInput: the scoring of a certain football competition goes this way.\nOutput: \"the final score is 1 - 1, so the tournament is going to get a draw.\n\\end{code}\n\nThis appears to be a description of a state; and no answer is necessary to this one for some definitions of question. But this description is not entirely a valid example of input.\n\nAnother issue is what do you do with data that contains missing or improper tags or formatting? If we parse your example incorrectly, then that problem statement may get mis-attributed.\n\nThere's also the issue of missing tests, and missing documentation.\n\nHere's a basic example of what a test file would look like.

Because if he/ she thinks all about themselves rather than the team, the boss will end up leading them into nothing because they will not be able to work properly for themselves because they put aside their personal wants and needs.

{"idx": 808, "text": "A Choices: 1 ) Choice B; 2 ) Choice C\n\nIn some ways, Choice B is reasonable, but the airplanes actually reside at Choice B. War planes are kept on the aircraft carrier as a matter of policy. That way, a single act of aggression will not cripple a battle group. War planes are also flown off aircraft carriers when they leave on a mission. Some of the sky is indeed unavailable for planes (the airspace over enemy nations and the areas declared off limits for planes), but the sky is generally an acceptable place to put planes. So Choice D is wrong. As for Choice E, crashes are fairly frequent, but they are generally due to mechanical failure or a pilot's error. War planes are very well built and well maintained. If anything, they are more prone to mechanical failure than non-war planes. So we will reject Choice E. This leaves Choice C as the best answer.\n\n\n#### Answer: \n\nChoices: 1 ) 1 (32 / 75); 2 ) 2 (75 / 32); 3 ) None of these\n\nHere are the rules for solving such problems. Suppose the speed limits are 35 mph (as they are on some local highways). You will travel 35 miles if you travel 35 mph. Now, if the speed limit were 25 mph, you would travel 25 / 35 or 71% of the distance in the same time. \n\nAs you get slower, the ration gets larger. When the speed limit is 50 mph, one will travel only 37.6% as far if one goes as fast as possible.\n\nSo: Suppose your car has traveled a distance of 72 miles. Its top speed in miles per hour is: 1 ) 32 (72 / 105); 2 ) (32 / 10); 3 ) 0.00\n\nThe distance is 72 / 116 or about 61% of the distance. So if it is traveling at top speed, it covered about 61% as much distance as it could if it travel at top speed. So its top speed is 72 *", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}

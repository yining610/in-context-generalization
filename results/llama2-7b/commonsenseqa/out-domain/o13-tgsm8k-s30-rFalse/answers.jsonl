There are 9 different groups possible.  The total value of all the coins is $5.97.  How many of each type of coin did Sam and Jake have?\nOutput: \n22 dimes\n15 nickels\n5 quarters\n4 pennies\nIn the first group, \"p\", we will say it is \"penny\".  It represents pennies\nIn each of the other groups, \"x\" represents the same for each group.  For this case, it is a number.  So, to represent the number of pennies as an \"x\", the answer for this group would be \"x\".  So, it's \"p\" to the second group, \"x\" to the third group, and so on.\nFor this particular question, since we do not have the original values, we will have to subtract to know the total (in this case) total value.\nSince we do not know the values of the pennies, we can't subtract.  Therefore, we have to solve for $5.97 by using the values of the other groups.\nThe pennies are the easiest to do, because they add up to $0.40\nTherefore, we would have to subtract $0.40 by dividing by \"x\" (since this represents the number of pennys, we will call it \"np\")  We know np is not 4, because we already accounted for the ones in the first column in the first group.  So, it must be in one of the other groups given.\n$5.77 - 0.40 = 5.37\n$5.349 - 0.49 = 5.259 - 0.099\nSo, x = 31", "answer": "A: selling out"}

Here I am using the if loop \nLet I will assume that there is only possible integer value we can get that value is `30`\n\n```python\nif input == 30:\n    return 310\nelse:\n    return 0\n```\n\n**2)** Use of the range to calculate the total number of days and return\n\n```python\ndays = input\nif days.lower() == '11 days':\n    return int(days) + 1\nelif input.lower() == '60 miles':\n    return int(((int(input) / 24) * 60) + 1 )\n```\n\n**3)** We have already written for the second question that there is only one integer value we can receive here and that is `500`. So, we are assuming this as the value and we use the if statement \n\n```python\nnumber_of_days = input\nif number_of_days == 14:\n    return 500\nelif input == '3 days':\n    return 52.5\n```\n\n**4)** Use of sum operator here \n\n```python ambulance = 1700```\n\n```python output = ambulance + number_of_days```\n\n**5)** Here we are using the while loop to loop through the number and then we use the * operator to multiple 6 and then we are subtracting from the total amount we got previously \n\n```python \nweights = input\nsum = 0 \nfor sum in range(len(weight) - 1", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

How  much, in dollars,  did she  pay for  the  rental.\n\n\n   \n```python\n#define x = 30 \n#define y = rental = 'r'\n \n #code\n print(x*y)\n```\nIn order to convert the number of hours she rented into dollars, we must multiply the number of days by the per day rate and then add 200. In the following example, which uses the same logic, x is 5 and the per day rate is 1.99. The second line has four equal parts of a circle. For example, each area in red is 1.98% of the entire circle. Because each area represents 1.98%, the area in blue represents 75% of the pie and is thus larger than the red areas. After the x and y coordinates are input you may find that they are not in the same range so you must set the range before starting.\n\n```python\n#python\nimport numpy as np\n#from math import sin, cos\n#from scipy.special import jvp\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n```\n\n\n```python\nd = 10\n#range = [-100: 100]\nrange = [4,20]\n#plot 1\nfig = plt.figure()\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,2,1)\nax2 = fig.add_axes([0.05, 1, 0.9, 0.06])\ns = ax1.plot([1,2,3],xlabel='x1')\nax2.plot(['a','b','c'],label='x2')\nax2.set_ylim(15,5)\nplt.show()\n#plot 2\nfig = plt.gcf()\n#fig.set_size_inches(5,3)\nfig.canvas.get_tk_widget", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

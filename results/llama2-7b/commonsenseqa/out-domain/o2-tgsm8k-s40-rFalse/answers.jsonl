Choices: A: Find the sum of all the digits in the month and day. Divide by 10. If the remainder is 5, divide by 5, and if it is 1, divide by 3. If the month is February, if the sum is 0, it is a leap. If it is not, it is not a leap year. If the month is not February, and the remainder of the dividend is 1, it is a leapt year. If the remainder is odd, it is not a jump year. If the remainder has a remainder of 1, it is always a leap year Choice: D: First find the sum of all the even digits in the month and the day. Divide that sum by two. If the remainder is an even number, it is a leape year with a February birthday; if the remainder is an uneven number, it is a jump year. If that day has not yet come to pass, discard those data Choices: C: First find the difference between 47 and the number of months from 1970 till then. Now find the sum of all digits in the month and divide by the result.

You can buy only two different types of flowers and buy one of each or two of one type. Peonies are the cheapest and daffodils the most expensive (26 times the price of a peony). Together, you cannot spend less than $36.00 or more than $72.50. How much can you spend on different types of flowers?\nOutput: Answer the following multiple choice question: 1.Answer should be B) $55\nIf peonies are cheapest, I can spend $27 on them and $25 on tulips since tulips are $2 more expensive than peonies. So far, I spent up to $52. But I still need to spend $20 to reach $72. Therefore, I must choose another type of flowers and spend $25 on daffodils.  Therefore, I can spend all $27 on peonies and $25 on daaffodils to reach $52. After this, I can spend $7 for tulips and $25 for daffodils. Finally, I can spend $55 on different types of flowers(total of 6=3 for peonies, 5 for tulips, 7 for daffodils and 15 for roses).\n\n\n### Bonus! Questions \n\n 1.

If there are 380 students in the English and history classes combined, how many 7th graders are in the 8th grade English history class?\n\n<div markdown = \"1\">***\n**Solution:**\nYou can solve this by using recursive logic:\n\nFirst off assume the number of students in the 7 th grade is N;\nthen the students in gr 8th is 3 times of N.\n\nSince the total number of students in 7th and 8th is 860;\nthen there should be 3 860/3 = 287 students of grade 8th \nand gr 8th should have 60 times of students of gr 7th, which equals 1129 students. \nThen subtract the number of students in 8th grade from the number of students in all grades, \n1129 - 287 = 842 students in all the classes.\nFinally, this is a trick; if there's one person in all the classes other than a teacher, than there's only one student; \nso to find the number of 7th standard students is to divide,842-1, with N to get the number of students", "answer": "E: get food"}

So then my C is A - B = 8 - 7 = 1.\n\nTo check if my answer is the same as the question I subtracted B from A and got the same result. So to see this again here is this solution rewritten to solve the problem like this:\n\n![](3.jpg)\n\nHere is how I solved this question. (A=5, B=12). You can solve this question in this way too.  So this is how they are supposed to be solved. If someone finds a better solution to how can I do this please tell me.\n\ninput: A = 5 B = 12 C = A - B C = 5 - 12 C = -7\n\nThis was a good question to solve.", "answer": "D: hat rack"}

The numbers along each row correspond to the number of the month (starting at 1 for January). 2. The columns represent days of the week, with Sunday as a 1, Monday as a 2, Tuesday as a 3, Wednesday as a 4, Thursday as a 5, Friday as a 6, and Saturday as a 7. 3. Each cell in the grid is the total sales for the day of the week the person did their shopping, plus the temperature in the city for that particular day. 4. If a cell has any value of 1, it must be exactly 1 in that square. 5. Every cell will contain only one 1. 6. The maximum integer value for a cell is determined by using the same temperature rule that is stated earlier in the problem. That means that for the city with the highest ever recorded temperature, the maximum integer value will be 7; if the city has ever set a record for coldest temperature, the maximum integer will be \u22127. 7. A cell with a number not assigned in problem 6 can take on the temperature of the nearest higher or lower recorded temperature, whichever is closer. 8. You must use no more than 45 cells to record the sales for every person. Any cells with no sales can be ignored. 9. Your final report should show the day of the week, month, and year for each person's sales for each city.

In how many ways are you able to divide the first number into the second number so that the quotient is a single digit number? (use division method)\n\n\n### Answer\n#### Divide 1271 into 1261:\nThere are 2 ways (excluding the division 1261/1271) to divide 1271 in to 1261.\nFirst method:\nThe dividend, 1271, is smaller than divisor, 1261, so the quotient is 2.\nThe division goes into two cases: Case 1 and case 2.\nCase1: The remainder is less than divisor which is 1261 Divisor is smaller than dividend so by this condition case 1 is possible and not other conditions.\n\nCase 1: The digits of case 1 division is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 9.\n\nThe divisor contains of two digits.\n\nNumber of Digits between dividend and divisor = 2\n\n(Remainder in case1) / (Digits of divisor) = 5 and remainder is not 1 so divisor contains of two 5 digit number or the remainder is 10 or greater. Then the divisor contains of 10 digit.\n\nSo, the case 1 can happen if the number of digits of remainder are 5 or less than it.\nSince, 1=1, 2=1+1, 3=1+1+1, 4=1+1+2, 5=1+2, 6=1+2+1, 7=1+2+2, 8=1+3, 9=1+3+1\n\nIn all of these cases the digit 7 is 0 or not in dividend.\nSo the total 1271 digits = 1, 2 or 3 and the remainder not divisor contains 5 or less than 5 digit.

First, to find that 90, and second,  to get that how many Schnauzer are there in this case.\n\nFor first step, I need to add all the digits in this statement,\n\n`n = 20 + 3 + (5 - 1)`\nThen I got this:\n\n`n =78`\n\nThen I can use this number n, for the next part of the question.\n\nTo find out how many Schnauzan are there, I need to find out how many differences does it have with Doberman. \n\nSince the whole statement is that `n-3 = 90`\n\nthen by subtracting 3 on the left side with the number `n` on the right side, I obtained this:\n\n`90 -3 = 87`\n\n`3 = 90 - n`\n\n`n =23`\n\nThen I need to divide the number `n` by `3` for the result. Since `3x` is equal to `n`\n\n`x=n/3`\n\n`x = 23/3`\n`x = 8`\n\nI obtained that how many Schnauseer are there in that case.", "answer": "E: learning about"}

This is because the answers to the above 3 example multiple choice problems are given in sequence. Also, the above multi choice questions might require a lot of thinking depending on the child's thinking ability. To be on the safe side, 3 problems are enough to prepare for this level of logical thinking.\n\nIf a child has already taken a course similar to this, then it might be too easy for him to think up these questions. He may be able to solve it in less than 3 minutes.  \nThe next level involves questions about the child's ability to look at two different problems and answer them without referring to any note or example problem. For example,\nInput: If one person can make a circle in one minute then, on average, how long will it take 10 people to make 10 circles?\nOutput: 10 minutes\n\nInput:  If 50 feet per minute is the average speed at which a snake can crawl, how fast could it crawl a path of 3600 feet in 1 hour?\nOutput: 900 feet per minute (or 15 miles per hour).\n\nThis level of logical thinking is required for math and science.

You will need 4 * 5 * 6  = 144.  The input array is a perfect square. \n\nThe first program asks for the first three numbers in the array.  In each of the other programs we want to access the last two numbers in the array.\n\nTo find the second number in the array, we use the index of the first number (a.k.a the base, a.k.a the subscripts), 0 because arrays start counting at 0.  The last element of the array resides at the subscript `arrayLength - 1`. \n\n```javascript\nfunction firstProgram(arrayOfNumbers, callback) {\n    console.log(arrayOfNumbers[0]);\n    console.log(`The second number in the ${arrayOfNumbers[0]} is ${arrayOfNumbers[1]}`);\n}\n````\n\nThe second problem asks for the third number in the array... we get the difference between the middle and two elements and multiply by 10.\n\n```javascript\nvar firstProgram = function(arrayOfNumbers,callback) {\n    console\n\n    if(calculate_difference(arrayOfNumbers[1],arrayOfNumbers[0]) == 0){\n        console.log(arrayFomNumber);\n    }\n    else {\n        console.log(`The fourth number in the ${array_of_numbers[0]}`);\n        console.log('(Calculated by subtracting the second number from the first number and multiplying by 10)');\n    }\n};\n```\n\nFor the third question, we use modulus.  Modulus says what is left after a number is divided by another number.  To find the remainder, use: \n\n```javascript \nnumber % number\n```\n\nTo find the remainder after dividing 453 by 17, use: \n```javascript\n453 % 17\n```\n\n```javascript\n  First: \n    function firstProgram(arrayOfNums,callback", "answer": "E: motel"}

{"text": "E\n---\n[solution]\n---\nThis is a 3-sentence question (and I cannot understand)...\n\n### Step-by-Step\n\nLet's try to solve this problems one by one. First, let's think about the first question.\n\n### First Question:\nWe know that:\n```\nFive less than three times the  number of Doberman  puppies plus the  difference  between  the  number  of  Doberman  puppi\nes and  the  number   of  Schnauzers  is  equal  to  90.  If  the  number  (of  Doberman  Puppies)  is  (20)  How  many  Schnauz\ners  are  there?\n```\nFirst, solve for the first question with a simple subtraction, then solve the second question.\n\nSo,\n```\nFive  less   tha  three  times   the  number  of Doberman puppi\nes plus the difference between the Doberman puppie and the Schnauzers\nis equal to 90                                                              \n\n10 x 6 = 60 = 90 \n\nNow  we  can  get 100 as follows\n\n5 x 10 =50\n                \n10 x 10 = 100\n                \n19 = 100-90\n                \nSo, there are 90 doberman puppies.\nSince the difference is 19, subtract 19.\nTherefore,\n41 is the answer for (a)\n\n### Second Question:\nSimilarly, we can solve this problem.\n\nThe number of doberman puppie is 20. But this is not the required answer.\n\nLet's solve this problem:\n\nThe answer of this problem is 4.\n\nLet'e make up another example: \n\nIf we  had 61  dogs, 28 Doberman, 23 Schnauzers, 20 Dachshunds, 16 Boston Terriers, and 14 Labradors.

You also know that the toys he picked and that he bought one-eighteenth of the total. What to think? You know that 4 is one-eighth of 27, so a simple substitution solves everything.\n\n[https://code.solving-interviews.com/stupid-math-stories/](https://code.solvings-interviews.com \"https://code.solvin-g-interviews.com\") - https://code.solving - interviews.com/stucid - math - stories/", "answer": "E: retail store"}

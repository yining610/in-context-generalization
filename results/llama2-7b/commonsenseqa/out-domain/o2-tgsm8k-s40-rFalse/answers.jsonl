Shaking hands will make the students feel good.\nIf my choice is b: control events, then that means the student would control an event. \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n### Demonstraion:\n\nInput: Five less that three times the number of Dog breed times the number of Dog bred is the same as 18. If the number of Dog breeds is 12, how many Dog breeds are their altogether?\n\nAnswer: 180. To find the answer, subtract 90 from 32, this leaves you with 20.  Then times it by five, which leaves the answer as 100. Then, add 12 to the answer, which makes the answer 180.  Now is the time to add 18.\n\nIf my choice of d, is the correct response, then when I multiply the number of dog breeds by five, that means that i will multiply the amount of dog breeds by eachother.  Then that means that dog breeds times 5 is 60.  After I subtract 60 from 80, that should result in 20.  \n\nIf my choice is choice e, then the first statement is true.  I subtract two from the numerator, subtract two from the denominator, and I end up with 18.  Now i will subtract 18 from 32. This leaves me with 14, and that is correct. \n\nIf my choice was f, then to find the correct amount of numbers i was going to have to use two to the power of three and four. First, I am going to take 2 to the third power, which is equal to forty nine.  Then I will take 2 times 2, which is equal to four.  Then, I will  I will multiply forty nine by four, which is equal to 196.  Now that i have that answer, I am going to subtract 156 from 180, and that leaves me with 24.", "answer": "D: think creatively"}

If the middle number is larger than any other number then the median is the largest number of the list. If the median is equal we have to check every remaining element and find the lowest natural number that doesn't appear in the list. The missing number is either smaller or larger than the median. If it is larger the median is the missing number, otherwise we found the missing number.\n\n### Response  (b)\nWe start by identifying the number of missing objects. There are 101 objects missing. The 51st natural number is equal or larger than the median in the middle of the list, which gives us 51-50=1. We found the smallest integer that is missing.

Solid geometry can answer these types of problems. The stations are sealevel, and the difference in levels between the stations is 2 inches. The trolley travels up the hill to get to the two stations. The trolley has to travel up the hill with a 5.5 inch height advantage for the height at the two stations.

How many apples are there for every other container, on average?\nAnswer: 81.3333...\n\n### Explanation:\nEach separate container has 288 appples. We then divide by 6 because there are multiple containers. This gives us each container having 288 appels 6 times to account for the 6 containers. Doing the long division on a calculator this gives us an average of 81.3.\n\n### Input Question:\nRosalynne had 14 more nickels left in her wallet than dimes. The sum of their denomination was 155. How many of which types of coins did she have?\n\n### Expected Answer:\nNickles: 50, Dimes: 105\n\n### Exploration:\n\nShe started with 14 more nickles than dimes since there is 50 cents to a dollar. We can then find the total amount of coin in her wallet by starting with nickels and dimes. This will give us a total of 155 because we already know $1 is 50 cnts, and 35 cents are equal to 1 nickle. We also know that we started with 14 less dimes than nickels to start off with. This means that we have 35 cents more nickles so adding the original 14 to these we have a total of 49 nickles. This comes out to be 100 cents (1 dollar). This means that we then have a total of 50 dimes. From here we just subtract them to find the original question.\n\n## Instructions:\nA man had more nickels than dimes 45 of which were nickels and the remainder were dimes. \nHow many pennies did he have?\n\n## Result:\nPennies: 870.5\n\n## Instrucions:\nFrom this he had $", "answer": "E: hospital"}

It will tell you the right answer.\n\n### Solution:\nIf the input does not include a question mark, then \"I am not sure\" should generally be the response (per section title response).\n\nIf the input _does_ include a question mark, the response should be a suggestion to the caller. A suggestion could be a multiple choice question, with options lined up next to it as a checkmark. For instance, if the input is \"Can I please receive a multiple guess answer to this question?\" the computer's response should be \"I am not sure this is what you mean, but you can receive a multiple guess answer.\"\n\nIn both cases, the format the input and responses should match a multiple guess answer. This does not require a question mark in the response. However, if the caller would like a question-and-answer response, the question should obviously be phrased as a question, followed by a question mark.\n\n### Examples of inputs and responses that work:\nWhen an input is received, it should be responded to by a multiple choice response. For instance, if we were the computer, the following input \"I would like to receive a multiple guess answer on this question\" would be responded to with the multiple choice response \"You may.\"\n\nHere are a few responses that will work.\n\n> What type of math do I do in order to find a value? ______\n\n> What did I do in order to reach a value? _______\n\n> What do I do in order find what is in between values? _____\n\n\n### Exploring this part of the program:\n> What do I learn from the answers", "answer": "C: transistor"}

In this case the word \u201cdissipated\u201d is used because this word means that the money that someone has used has no purpose anymore, especially there is nothing left after that. The word \u201cfall apart\u201d also is appropriate because it is the same situation with using all of money with nothing left. The word is also appropriate and meaningful if it comes from a negative situation. And about the last question, it is also appropriate and meaninging because this question asks about the difference between the two options: 20 and 25.

Write a JavaScript snippet to compare two arrays by using their index to perform actions when they both have the same index.\n\n## Step I: Comment on, and explain your code.\n```\nfunction unique(str){\nconsole.log(\"enter a string\")\nthis.characters=\"\"\nthis.isUnique=\"\"\nvar isUnique=\"false\"\nvar characters=str.split(\"\")\nfor(var x=0;x<str.length;x++){\n   if(characters[x]!=\" \"){\n       if(!isUnique){\n      this.characters=characters[x]\n    \n   isUnique=true\n      }else{\n    \n  \n        this.characters+=\"\"\n      }\n//else\n}\nif(isUnique){\nthis.isUniest=true\nelse\nthis.isUniqe=false\n}\nreturn this.characters+this.isUniest\n}\n//console.log(unique(\"Hello World\"))\n//alert(\"The number of unique characters in Hello World is \"+unique(\"Hello World\"))//\nreturn 0\n}\n\n```\n\n## Step II: Reflect and summarize your progress.\nI started of by writing the unique function which works without any problems. Then I tried to edit it to give a output for the program. I changed the output variable in this case to var characters=str.split() and for= x in charters I added a number to it. This made me understand how the function was working. \n\n###", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}

If the number of Dog breeds is 12, how many Dog breeds are their altogether?<n><n>Answer: 180. To find the answer, subtract 90 from 32, this leaves you with 20.  Then times it by five, which leaves the answer as 100. Then, add 12 to the answer, which makes the answer 180.  Now is the time to add 18.<n><n>If my choice of d, is the correct response, then when I multiply the number of dog breeds by five, that means that i will multiply the amount of dog breeds by eachother.  Then that means that dog breeds times 5 is 60.  After I subtract 60 from 80, that should result in 20.  <n><n>If my choice is choice e, then the first statement is true.  I subtract two from the numerator, subtract two from the denominator, and I end up with 18.  Now i will subtract 18 from 32. This leaves me with 14, and that is correct. <n><n>If my choice was f, then to find the correct amount of numbers i was going to have to use two to the power of three and four. First, I am going to take 2 to the third power, which is equal to forty nine.  Then I will take 2 times 2, which is equal to four.  Then, I will  I will multiply forty nine by four, which is equal to 196.  Now that i have that answer, I am going to subtract 156 from 180, and that leaves me with 24.<n>

Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Option A doesn't fit. People go to a river to swim or go boating; they don't take their cars downstream.<n><n>Option B does fit. Some people like driving through large cities but others may not.<n><n>Option C is also true of the car repair shop.<n><n>Option D wouldn't make sense to park your car in a busy, cluttered or crowded neighborhood. <n><n>Option E does fit. Some people may leave their cars at a neighbor for temporary storage when they are out of town or just want some extra space on their property.  <n><n>### Response 3:<n> <n><n>Option A doesn’t fit. This option is for when your favorite team wins and is heading to the playoffs. I know this because whenever my teams win I get super excited and go crazy with my reaction.<n><n>Option B I know isn’t when my favorite sports team wins a game or the championship. This option is what happens when one of our best actors dies. For instance when Chadwick Boseman died most people were crying in the streets. When my favorite team wins they are ecstatic so that is definitely not an option because when your favorite sports team (or any sports team for that matter) wins a game no one is crying.<n> <n>Option C definitely means you’re doing something bad that you don’t want the government to control like doing drugs and smoking weed. But people don’t do that at playgrounds and sports fields.<n><n>Option D I know means when you buy a lot of things, most likely a new electronic device, a lot of food and your body starts to not recognize things like this. I know this because recently I was on my diet and went to a movie theater with my friends. They got two large popcorns and two large sodas for all of us. I can’t even remember what my body did because I lost track of my weight since I’m trying to eat healthy. <n> <n>Option E also happens with my diet where I have to eat really healthy because I’m not only trying to lose weight but I’m also trying to stay in shape and make sure I get enough protein. Recently I went to the grocery store and I couldn’t even buy vegetables and just salad because I knew if I bought lots of bread, salty food, and

He keeps his socks in the bowl and puts his shoes on the right side of the dresser while placing his inhaler on the left side of the dresser. He keeps his slippers on the left side of his chair. When Dr. Banks gets home and wants to put on his slippers, he will walk to the left side of the chair, get his slippers, walk back to the right side of the chair, put them on, then find the inhaler. Does Dr. Banks follow a pattern?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>In the story, Dr. Banks is a dentist who has a very busy dentist practice. After work he prefers to put on his slipper to relax rather than his shoe which he normally takes off before heading up stairs to hang up his socks on the dresser on the left hand side. Each night as he hung up his socks on left side of his dresser, on the right hand side of his dresser he kept his inhaler, slippers, and shoes. To put on the slippers later he walks to right hand side of his chair to put on his slips, and walk back to the left hand side and put them on, while looking for the inhaler. Dr. Banks follows a pattern.

The difference in levels between the two trolley stations is equal to 2 inches. How tall is the hill above sealevel?"<n>### Response: The equation is x+y=w where x is the level of one station, y is the level of the other station, and w is the height of the hill above sealeve;l. Solid geometry can answer these types of problems. The stations are sealevel, and the difference in levels between the stations is 2 inches. The trolley travels up the hill to get to the two stations. The trolley has to travel up the hill with a 5.5 inch height advantage for the height at the two stations. Therefore w plus 2=5.5 or w+2=5.5 which we can solve for w. This leads to w = 5.5-2 or w = 5 inches taller. And therefor, the hill is 5 inches tall.<n>### Input:  What is the answer to the expression shown below?

Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n><n>### Response:		<n>A person does not need the things that sleep provides to relax or rejuvenate if they are tired on account of having done too much in the time period that they do whatever they do (this could be physical or intellectual or spiritual). That means they can rejuvenate and relax however they choose. Restlessness and dreams may or may not happen but they are not the cause of someone not getting sleep at night. A person might have to wake from sleep to do the things that they need to do so they might still be tired. The only thing that a person can have at night that is good for health is sleep which is the time for rest and dreaming. Having lots of dreams cannot make up for sleep deprivation. Therefore sleep is good to some extent but not good for the total experience.

How many apples are there for every other container, on average?<n>Answer: 81.3333...<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Each separate container has 288 appples. We then divide by 6 because there are multiple containers. This gives us each container having 288 appels 6 times to account for the 6 containers. Doing the long division on a calculator this gives us an average of 81.3.<n><n>### Input Question:<n>Rosalynne had 14 more nickels left in her wallet than dimes. The sum of their denomination was 155. How many of which types of coins did she have?<n><n>### Expected Answer:<n>Nickles: 50, Dimes: 105<n><n>### Exploration:<n><n>She started with 14 more nickles than dimes since there is 50 cents to a dollar. We can then find the total amount of coin in her wallet by starting with nickels and dimes. This will give us a total of 155 because we already know $1 is 50 cnts, and 35 cents are equal to 1 nickle. We also know that we started with 14 less dimes than nickels to start off with. This means that we have 35 cents more nickles so adding the original 14 to these we have a total of 49 nickles. This comes out to be 100 cents (1 dollar). This means that we then have a total of 50 dimes. From here we just subtract them to find the original question.<n><n>## Instructions:<n>A man had more nickels than dimes 45 of which were nickels and the remainder were dimes. <n>How many pennies did he have?<n><n>## Result:<n>Pennies: 870.5<n><n>## Instrucions:<n>From this he had $

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January.

Choices:  A: vessel B: box C: transistor D: submarine E: lamp<n><n>### Response:		The lamp.<n><n>### Input and Responses:<n>When there is no input, the computer will respond with "I am not sure what you mean." Otherwise, the response is a "suggestion".<n>Responses are phrased as statements followed by question marks - e.g., "I am not sure about your example."<n><n>### Explanation:<n>When there is an input, the task is to make a response that appropriately complies with the request.<n><n>Responses should match the expected format for a multiple guess answer to the question input.<n><n>### Hint:<n>A good way to see a hint for this question is to press the "hint" button. It will tell you the right answer.<n><n>### Solution:<n>If the input does not include a question mark, then "I am not sure" should generally be the response (per section title response).<n><n>If the input _does_ include a question mark, the response should be a suggestion to the caller. A suggestion could be a multiple choice question, with options lined up next to it as a checkmark. For instance, if the input is "Can I please receive a multiple guess answer to this question?" the computer's response should be "I am not sure this is what you mean, but you can receive a multiple guess answer."<n><n>In both cases, the format the input and responses should match a multiple guess answer. This does not require a question mark in the response. However, if the caller would like a question-and-answer response, the question should obviously be phrased as a question, followed by a question mark.<n><n>### Examples of inputs and responses that work:<n>When an input is received, it should be responded to by a multiple choice response. For instance, if we were the computer, the following input "I would like to receive a multiple guess answer on this question" would be responded to with the multiple choice response "You may."<n><n>Here are a few responses that will work.<n><n>> What type of math do I do in order to find a value? ______<n><n>> What did I do in order to reach a value? _______<n><n>> What do I do in order find what is in between values? _____<n><n><n>### Exploring this part of the program:<n>> What do I learn from the answers

(Choices: A: One cup equals 7/8 a quart B: One cup equals 1 1/16th pound C: One cup equals 8 ounces D: One cup equals 2/4 a quart)<n>### Response: B<n>### Explanations: You may have answer choices A through D. That will make you look at the rest of the question before reading through. But this answer is D because you have 'equals 2/4 of a quart'. You have to match the right term with the term of 'cups', which is D. But the question is 'how much'. You have to use 'how much' with D. So answer is B.<n><n>### Explanaton: It's B because you have something like B, A, C.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90. If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Answer: 36<n><n>### Input:He had been doing favors for everybody at work, it was frustrating not getting any what for it? Choices:  A: let down B: respect C: illness D: satisfaction E: gratitude<n><n>### Response:		A: Choice A would not make sense because it is not describing a what for it but a favor he has done for somebody, rather the action that he did for them.<n>### Solution, with complete explanation: A: choice A would not make sense in this case because it is describing favor that was done to somebody for something and not the result of his favor that he has done. Instead, it is the effect on the favor that he has done to somebody else. It is quite unclear what “it” is in the sentence that we are trying to analyze and what the author is aiming to say.<n><n>### The key to this problem is that the correct answer is not A, B, or C, but really it is E.<n><n>### A: Dr. Banks gave away the remaining to theothbrushes, 1/2 each month, which means that he gave them out equally spaced and in equal numbers. Therefore, he gave half in April and the other half in May. The busiest month was the one in May.<n><n>### B: Dr. Banks did not have a slow month, given that he gave out toothbrushes only for 2 months in a year (and then he gave all of them out, not gradually month by month) So it is not the answer.<n><n><n>

The list can’t have any duplicate numbers. Once the user inputs a list of numbers, the program should print a true statement or a false statement about the list. For example, if the list is abcdef1, the program should print “The list contains duplicate numbers.” A list with no duplicates will print “The list does not contain any duplicates."<n><n>### Bonus Challenge:<n><n>### Instruations:Write a program that is able to compare the size of two lists. Assume that both lists contain strings of mixed lowercase and uppercase letters. To do this, you will need to work with strings. For example, say you are working with two lists of words: [“hello”, “world!”,”yes!”] and [] [“hello”, “hello”,”world!”,”world!”] For a list to be longer than the other,  the first list must be larger than the second list. For example, using the words listed above, we would output “The list containing “hello” is longer than the other list” for the first call and we would print “The list containing “world” is longer than the list containing “hello”” for the second call.<n><n>## Time Complexity: <n>### O(n!)<n>### O(min{n1, n2})

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Answer: 36<n><n>### Input:What is necessary for learning by yourself? Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n><n>### Response:		<n>Exposure is an important part of the learning process, but how one interacts with that exposure depends on patience. One cannot expect to have an epiphany after one viewing of educational material.  Patience and thought both aid in the exposure process because they determine the level of interaction.  If someone reads something and tries to memorize it they will not truly learn it; they're cooperating and thinking are essential in comprehending.<n><n>### Input<n>The time and energy you spend in learning a new area of study will greatly reward your time and effort in the future.  How should you spend your time and energy in being successful? Choices A: Read ahead<n><n>B: Skim<n><n>C: Read everything<n><n>D: Underline key words<n><n>E:  Write down every fact<n><n>### Response<n>I agree with your statement that, “read everything.”  Without a good understanding of the material one is working with, learning new concepts will be difficult and confusing.  When I study material,  I generally read it and then use it when necessary as a reference.  Underlining key words is also important so as to keep myself grounded in a subject.  The more important words are those which make me pause and think about what I am trying to learn.  This helps me to focus on the main points of the material.<n><n>### The only way to learn is by reading everything in the book, skimming, highlighting key words, reading ahead, and writing down every fact.  <n><n>### Response to Question 1<n>“…the only way to learn is…” isn’t true. Every technique you mentioned is just a way of learning, not a requirement.  For every class that I participate in, I am always given a chapter of assigned readings that must be read before the next class. If I were to read everything in question, it would take me so long to complete that all I would be able to do is skim.  When people say that to me, I tell them to learn everything, learn it to a point where you have the knowledge and can use it.  This is a much faster way to learn than just reading everything. In the long run, it seems that everyone reads everything in their class material in some regard.<n><n>### Response 2<n>I am a reader, and I don't generally like to skim; instead I

Choices:  A: open doors B: drink water C: need food D: annoy E: play<n><n>### Response:		If I am thinking in terms of one individual cat. If one of these choices occurs, they will have the need fulfilled. Then we can say they need another day. If they already had their food, they would be happy. This would occur if B or A would happen. If they need to open a door. If C is the only option left, then they would be happy.  But if D is the only option left for them, then they would want more things to play with. If E were the need, then they would be in a state of happiness, and the need would not occur. I am assuming the cat is an individual and not a feline species.  If that is the case, then the cat would be in need of a companion of their own species. That means each individual has their own need and may not fulfill the needs of others.<n><n>### Input<n><n>You are planning a picnic with your friends. You'd like to invite all of your close friends.

Choices:  A: dissipate B: flown C: disintegrate D: fall apart E: penultimate<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>* Input: What has happened to a person’s money after he or her has used the last ofit?<n>* Choices:<n>* C: disintegrate<n><n>### Discussion:<n>There are at least two common interpretations of what has happened to a person after he or she has been through a tough financial issue, especially the one in which he or she has used all of his or her money. In this case the word “dissipated” is used because this word means that the money that someone has used has no purpose anymore, especially there is nothing left after that. The word “fall apart” also is appropriate because it is the same situation with using all of money with nothing left. The word is also appropriate and meaningful if it comes from a negative situation. And about the last question, it is also appropriate and meaninging because this question asks about the difference between the two options: 20 and 25. The word "penultimate" in this sentence is unnecessary because it is already known that the word "ultimate" means the beginning. Besides, the word "ultimate' is the same as "25" which is already used.<n>

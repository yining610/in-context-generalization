Schnauzer number is smaller than Doberman number and the difference between them is 5, so in total there are 25.<n><n>`2.` Doberman and schnauzer are always changing numbers each month. The question asks the biggest difference, so we add up the difference of Doberman and Schnauzer in the two biggest and two smallest months. This gives us 53+67=120. It also gives a difference of 33. The biggest number is Doberman, which has to be less than 53 and 33 to make the 120, so if Doberman was more than 33 then it becomes more than 53 and so the biggest difference wasn't achieved in the biggest month.<n><n>### Input: If one sees a fox:<n><n>```JavaScript<n>if (i==“A”) {<n>	console.log('a');<n>} else if (i==“B”) {<n>				console.log('b');<n>} else if(i==‘C’) {<n>console.log('c');<n>} else if('D') {<n>console.log(‘d’);<n>} else if("E") {<n>console.log("e");<n>} else

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Output: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January.

Choices: A: Find the sum of all the digits in the month and day. Divide by 10. If the remainder is 5, divide by 5, and if it is 1, divide by 3. If the month is February, if the sum is 0, it is a leap. If it is not, it is not a leap year. If the month is not February, and the remainder of the dividend is 1, it is a leapt year. If the remainder is odd, it is not a jump year. If the remainder has a remainder of 1, it is always a leap year Choice: D: First find the sum of all the even digits in the month and the day. Divide that sum by two. If the remainder is an even number, it is a leape year with a February birthday; if the remainder is an uneven number, it is a jump year. If that day has not yet come to pass, discard those data Choices: C: First find the difference between 47 and the number of months from 1970 till then. Now find the sum of all digits in the month and divide by the result. If a remainder of ten is found, it is a leapy year; if a remainder of a non-multiple of ten is found, then it is a jump year Choice: E: First find the number of seconds elapsed in that leap second in the number of seconds elapsing between midnight January 1, 1970, and the closest time when the leapt day occurs. If that number is positive, the day is a leap year.If it is a negative number, it is a non-leap year.If a leap second occurs in that leap year, the month is February, and it is also February the year before Choice: all of the above are correct. The only valid way of determining whether a date is a leap year or not and whether or not that date is in the month of February is to add up the digits of the years and days and divide by two and if the remainder is even divide by two and if it is uneven is divisible by

Which property best describes the numbers? Choices:  a: all less than or equal to 1 b: all greater than 200 c: every 4th is negative d: all less than 1000 e: every number is an even prime number<n>Output: A<n><n>### Instruction:Describe/Exlain the above mentioned logic puzzle<n><n>##### The first two puzzles are both about the sum of consecutive integers. The answer to the second is that the integers aren't all positive, and the fifth one is the most valuable positive number.<n>##### The toothbrush problem is the simplest. They're halfing the remaining number among three months. So, in a month that the number is larger, they only had half as many toothbrushes left.<n>##### I'm not quite sure about binding, but I guess it means that a "bound" book is one that still has the original binding on it. So D means "a faithful book". The word that best fits the other four in the answer choices is "faithful" because that also means "loose".<n><n><n><n>### Conclusion:<n>- Not all the logic puzzles need an explicit answer. The answer is implicit.<n>- It's very repetitive to solve a lot of problem solving questions.<n>- The questions use similar logic to solve.

In our example, the first is:<n><n>input:A: train station<n>output:A: train station <n><n>Here is another answer:<n><n>input:newsstand<n>output:newsstand <n><n>If we use the time of first problem to compare with time of second problem, we can get the result: <n><n>|1    |A |         |41     |2        |<n>|2    |A |        1.25E+05    |2.25E+13  |<n><n>### The next step is we add another answer.<n><n>Input: One less than the 1/6 of n is equal to 7.65.

On the other hand, this method is really powerful in some extreme cases. I think this is also a general algorithm or at least good technique. I would like to recommend it to anyone who tries the algorithm in the future.

In month 1, she gives away 53 tobushes, in month 2, she gives away 67, in month 3, she gives away 46, and in April he gives away 46. In May she gives away half each month. However, in the problem we are finding out the difference between the biggest and smallest month, but since the doctor gives away half each month, we should only be using the number for the month and subtracting all other months after that, so that we do not calculate the same month twice in the equation.<n><n><n>- In the problem we are asked the question: What do people in the same FAMILY often share?

It helps clarify what approach is best to get the answer which is important in an interview setting as well. It reduces the fear of not doing the math problems well during an interview, which often happens to programmers that aren't used to doing math problems, so they spend a majority of the time on the math problem rather than the algorithms and data structures. Programming problems are generally not that much different than the math problems you encountered in high school in terms of the concepts involved as well as the basic approach to solving them.<n><n>--------------------------<n><n># Test Yourself<n>## 1. 5 less than three times the  number of doberman puppies<n>## 2. the difference between the number aof doberman pupppies<n>## 5. a cow, it was afond memory of the now defunt<n><n>--------------------------<n>

So then my C is A - B = 8 - 7 = 1.<n><n>To check if my answer is the same as the question I subtracted B from A and got the same result. So to see this again here is this solution rewritten to solve the problem like this:<n><n>![](3.jpg)<n><n>Here is how I solved this question. (A=5, B=12). You can solve this question in this way too.  So this is how they are supposed to be solved. If someone finds a better solution to how can I do this please tell me.<n><n>input: A = 5 B = 12 C = A - B C = 5 - 12 C = -7<n><n>This was a good question to solve.

The numbers along each row correspond to the number of the month (starting at 1 for January). 2. The columns represent days of the week, with Sunday as a 1, Monday as a 2, Tuesday as a 3, Wednesday as a 4, Thursday as a 5, Friday as a 6, and Saturday as a 7. 3. Each cell in the grid is the total sales for the day of the week the person did their shopping, plus the temperature in the city for that particular day. 4. If a cell has any value of 1, it must be exactly 1 in that square. 5. Every cell will contain only one 1. 6. The maximum integer value for a cell is determined by using the same temperature rule that is stated earlier in the problem. That means that for the city with the highest ever recorded temperature, the maximum integer value will be 7; if the city has ever set a record for coldest temperature, the maximum integer will be −7. 7. A cell with a number not assigned in problem 6 can take on the temperature of the nearest higher or lower recorded temperature, whichever is closer. 8. You must use no more than 45 cells to record the sales for every person. Any cells with no sales can be ignored. 9. Your final report should show the day of the week, month, and year for each person's sales for each city.

In how many ways are you able to divide the first number into the second number so that the quotient is a single digit number? (use division method)<n><n><n>### Answer<n>#### Divide 1271 into 1261:<n>There are 2 ways (excluding the division 1261/1271) to divide 1271 in to 1261.<n>First method:<n>The dividend, 1271, is smaller than divisor, 1261, so the quotient is 2.<n>The division goes into two cases: Case 1 and case 2.<n>Case1: The remainder is less than divisor which is 1261 Divisor is smaller than dividend so by this condition case 1 is possible and not other conditions.<n><n>Case 1: The digits of case 1 division is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 9.<n><n>The divisor contains of two digits.<n><n>Number of Digits between dividend and divisor = 2<n><n>(Remainder in case1) / (Digits of divisor) = 5 and remainder is not 1 so divisor contains of two 5 digit number or the remainder is 10 or greater. Then the divisor contains of 10 digit.<n><n>So, the case 1 can happen if the number of digits of remainder are 5 or less than it.<n>Since, 1=1, 2=1+1, 3=1+1+1, 4=1+1+2, 5=1+2, 6=1+2+1, 7=1+2+2, 8=1+3, 9=1+3+1<n><n>In all of these cases the digit 7 is 0 or not in dividend.<n>So the total 1271 digits = 1, 2 or 3 and the remainder not divisor contains 5 or less than 5 digit. So in case one of remain

Choices:  A: chess set B: strategy C: toy store D: chess game E: small case<n>Output:		E<n><n>The above three example problems are easy questions and they could be easily answered by most children. But, the above multiple choice questions aren't easy enough. This is because the answers to the above 3 example multiple choice problems are given in sequence. Also, the above multi choice questions might require a lot of thinking depending on the child's thinking ability. To be on the safe side, 3 problems are enough to prepare for this level of logical thinking.<n><n>If a child has already taken a course similar to this, then it might be too easy for him to think up these questions. He may be able to solve it in less than 3 minutes.  <n>The next level involves questions about the child's ability to look at two different problems and answer them without referring to any note or example problem. For example,<n>Input: If one person can make a circle in one minute then, on average, how long will it take 10 people to make 10 circles?<n>Output: 10 minutes<n><n>Input:  If 50 feet per minute is the average speed at which a snake can crawl, how fast could it crawl a path of 3600 feet in 1 hour?<n>Output: 900 feet per minute (or 15 miles per hour).<n><n>This level of logical thinking is required for math and science. If he cannot solve at least one of these two questions, it will be necessary for a class or a tutor to help him improve his logical thinking ability.<n><n>Next level of logical thinking is about answering questions with multiple choice and then explaining to the instructor the logic behind it. As an example,<n>Input: A cowboy is striding down the street in the main street of a village and he meets another cowboy who is on a horse. The first cowboy is 200 yards away from the entrance to his shop. He then runs on the horse to meet the other cowboy and they meet each other at a distance of 200 yards from the main street. The first cowboy runs to his shop while still on the horse and the second cowboy runs back to the main street from where he came. This second cowboy doesn't enter his shop. Instead, he stands 15. feet away from his shop on his horse. After staying there 15. seconds, he then starts again running on his horse towards the entrance of

In each of the other programs we want to access the last two numbers in the array.<n><n>To find the second number in the array, we use the index of the first number (a.k.a the base, a.k.a the subscripts), 0 because arrays start counting at 0.  The last element of the array resides at the subscript `arrayLength - 1`. <n><n>```javascript<n>function firstProgram(arrayOfNumbers, callback) {<n>    console.log(arrayOfNumbers[0]);<n>    console.log(`The second number in the ${arrayOfNumbers[0]} is ${arrayOfNumbers[1]}`);<n>}<n>````<n><n>The second problem asks for the third number in the array... we get the difference between the middle and two elements and multiply by 10.<n><n>```javascript<n>var firstProgram = function(arrayOfNumbers,callback) {<n>    console<n><n>    if(calculate_difference(arrayOfNumbers[1],arrayOfNumbers[0]) == 0){<n>        console.log(arrayFomNumber);<n>    }<n>    else {<n>        console.log(`The fourth number in the ${array_of_numbers[0]}`);<n>        console.log('(Calculated by subtracting the second number from the first number and multiplying by 10)');<n>    }<n>};<n>```<n><n>For the third question, we use modulus.  Modulus says what is left after a number is divided by another number.  To find the remainder, use: <n><n>```javascript <n>number % number<n>```<n><n>To find the remainder after dividing 453 by 17, use: <n>```javascript<n>453 % 17<n>```<n><n>```javascript<n>  First: <n>    function firstProgram(arrayOfNums,callback

First, let's think about the first question.<n><n>### First Question:<n>We know that:<n>```<n>Five less than three times the  number of Doberman  puppies plus the  difference  between  the  number  of  Doberman  puppi<n>es and  the  number   of  Schnauzers  is  equal  to  90.  If  the  number  (of  Doberman  Puppies)  is  (20)  How  many  Schnauz<n>ers  are  there?<n>```<n>First, solve for the first question with a simple subtraction, then solve the second question.<n><n>So,<n>```<n>Five  less   tha  three  times   the  number  of Doberman puppi<n>es plus the difference between the Doberman puppie and the Schnauzers<n>is equal to 90                                                              <n><n>10 x 6 = 60 = 90 <n><n>Now  we  can  get 100 as follows<n><n>5 x 10 =50<n>                <n>10 x 10 = 100<n>                <n>19 = 100-90<n>                <n>So, there are 90 doberman puppies.<n>Since the difference is 19, subtract 19.<n>Therefore,<n>41 is the answer for (a)<n><n>### Second Question:<n>Similarly, we can solve this problem.<n><n>The number of doberman puppie is 20. But this is not the required answer.<n><n>Let's solve this problem:<n><n>The answer of this problem is 4.<n><n>Let'e make up another example: <n><n>If we  had 61  dogs, 28 Doberman, 23 Schnauzers, 20 Dachshunds, 16 Boston Terriers, and 14 Labradors.  After six weeks, we have 60  dogs,

You take this number of toys down to the corner store for your child to pick, and the price of the toys is evenly distributed between you, resulting in a total of 7 cents. How many toys do you buy for every dollar your child picks?<n>Output: Four<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>-1) Three times the number of Doebie's minus 14 is an even number.<n>-2) We know that 330 divided by 12 equals 27, so it's logical to assume each month half are used and the other half are left over.<n>-3) A person from any of the 5 states he mentions can choose either a different state which is out of the equation or stay and go to that place.<n>-4) If you have 16 children, the toys that you buy are one-seventeenth of the price. You also know that the toys he picked and that he bought one-eighteenth of the total. What to think? You know that 4 is one-eighth of 27, so a simple substitution solves everything.<n><n>[https://code.solving-interviews.com/stupid-math-stories/](https://code.solvings-interviews.com "https://code.solvin-g-interviews.com") - https://code.solving - interviews.com/stucid - math - stories/<n><n><n><n>

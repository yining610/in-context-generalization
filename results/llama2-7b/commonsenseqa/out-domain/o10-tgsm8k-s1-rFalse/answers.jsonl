Use 1,2,3 as a structure, write the instructions in imperative clauses. For ex: 1. Write a number. 2. Add 2. Write the result. 3. Compare the result with 5. Write the number less than 5 if it is less than 5. else write 5. \n```\n\n### This task should present several challenging subtasks that should be solved.\n\n### There is an easy way to solve the subtasks to the point where the student will feel comfortable.\nBut there is no obvious way of presenting the solution to the task.

{"text": "You are the space shuttle.\n\n### Input\n\nThere are 33 houses and children. One group has 12 houses and 10 children. The other group has houses and children.\n\nWhat number of houses is in the group with less children?\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer: 5 houses.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe two groups have `27` houses total, meaning that 27 houses need to be subtracted from 33 houses, leaving only 6 houses remaining. For the first group, the total number of houses is 12, because the number of houses is equal to the number of children. Thus, 12 houses are removed, leaving 45 houses remaining. For the second group, the total number is 16, because 10 children are included in each house and 10 houses are added. If there are 10 children in one house, then 10 houses are 100 children, meaning that there are 100 remaining children in the second group, not including the 10 houses. 10 children are removed from each house, equaling 30 children total. The 6th house has 8 children included, meaning that 8 remaining children are removed.\n\n### Solution\n\nGiven the information that is provided, the two groups each have the same number of houses, but different numbers of children. The first group has 10 children per house, and the second group has 100 children per house. Since each house has 10 children, the number on houses will be subtracted from the total number of houses. The first group subtracts 10 children per 1 house, so 12 houses are subtracted from the total of 33, leaving 21 houses. The second group subtracts 1 child per 1 house, but there are more houses, so 10 children per each house are subtracted, for a total of 120 children being removed. Thus, the second group of houses is subtracted from their given information, which will remove 120 children total.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThese examples of reasoning with equations and proportions were taken from **Feedback.png** (png image).\n\n### Instructions\n\nAnswer questions 1-100.", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

You should use the `input()` function to directly copy the input into a variable rather than to print it.\n\nYou can also read a string from `stdin` into a variable.  \n\n## 5. You should use `raw_input()` to input the user's input directly rather than through `input()`.\n\n\n## 6. Use capitalized names for different parts of your code and variables. Capitalization (and spelling) are used to help differentiate between parts.\n\n### For example,\n\n\n### Input\n\n```python\nWhat's your name?\n```\n\n### Response\n\n```python\nMy name is John.\n```", "answer": "A: beast"}

An old car is likely more costly to run.  What is the minimum speed that will reduce the overall cost of driving a car?\n\n### Response\nAnswer: 40m/h\n\n#### Answer Explantion:\nFirst. If we decrease the speed to 40 mph, the fuel consumption is 40/90 which means 8 is fuel efficient than 60 mph. So 40 mph is a minimum value.\nSecond. If we increase the speed to 60 mph, fuel consumption will be 60/78, so it is worse than 40 mph. Therefore, 40 mph again is more fuel efficient than 6 mph.\n\n\n### Instructions\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\nQuestion: Sam and Mark are in a game of hide-and-seek.

{"text": "Answer:C (going to school).\n\n### Input1:The baker was short of butter.  The chocolatier was out of chocolate.  The candyman was out of candy.  The toffee-maker was low on almonds.  The jelly-maker had only six jelly beans left.  The licorice-maker had only two sticks of licorice!  Each could make just one kind of sweet.  How could they make the best candy they could, and still eat some of it themselves?\n\nInput2:The candyman and a chocolatier want to make the best candy for children at a local orphanage. Each candy-maker has a jar of each of their ingredients. They want to make a candy where one has tooth-filling sugar (toffee-maker), and one is delicious and shivery (jelly-maker). The licorice-stick can't be in candy that's filled with shivery goo. How many jars does each candy-maker need to take to make the best cure for the orphans?\n\n### Response1:The baker could make a cake with butter and almonds that would still taste good, while the toffee-maker could make a candy stick with just almonds. If the jelly-maker was the orphanage, she could make candy that would be eaten by children and also has jelly beans so that she would never be alone again.\n\n### Response2:The best way to solve the problem is to use two licorice-makers. This will make them able to make a candy that has two different fillings.

{"text": "A\n\n### What did you do?\nMy original response was to just guess because I'm unfamiliar with the word petrify and I'm not sure that it's even used correctly in the question. So I googled \"what is done to wood to attached something to it to make it permanant\" after taking out unfamiliar words like petrify and after removing things not necessary in the sentence like the word \"making it permanent\" and the word \"permanent\". I think I did this because I was under the impression that there was a lot of choice B options but this did not produce results. Then I tried guessing but my guess was incorrect. So I gave up and looked at the answer for more references on the process of \"attaching something to wood.\" Then I looked at some pictures. I found a picture of a chair which appears to have been carved into. As it is carved the wood then becomes molded to have a specific shape that creates the chair. And since it is molded they cannot change the shape of it and then it has stayed that way for a while if not permanently. So I think A: nailed because nailing things to wood is what makes things permanant.\n\n### How did it work?\nGoogle is a good way to figure out things about which you are uncertain. Also, pictures, even bad pictures may be useful in understanding how the process of what we ask the program to do is done. Also, pictures of what people do on a particular computer system may shed light on how to do things on a computer system or understand what a program that is asking you to do something will mean. For example here I could not understand what carving a log would create. So I looked at what types of wood, and other hardwood materials are used to design chairs. After viewing such a picture I quickly realized that nailing stuff is not the way to hold together a chair. Instead they put something against the chair that is softer to break as the chair needs to break for the chair to hold weight. I think people use wood because of how strong it is and how much weight it can hold.\n\n### Things you learned while doing this?\nWhen asking a program to do something. If you are unsure of the meaning of a word, look it up. If you do not understand the question, look up images of things similar to what the question asks about doing", "answer": "A: nailed"}

The area is 7^2= 50.\n\n### Solution2:Answer2:1. Since the perimeter is 21 cm, that means that the triangle is isosceles, and has 2 sides equal in length. 2. Since the isosceles triangle has equal side lengths, their angle measures are also equal. So, using similarity, we can say that the ratio of the length of the side to the ratio of the adjacent is 1:1. 3. Using similarity and proportional reasoning to convert the measures, we get 3.1 inches / inch = 31 inches.  For the third side, we plug 3 inches into the isosceles angle of 36 degrees and find a perimeter of 110 inches.", "answer": "A: go to church"}

{"text": ">Pay Debts\n\n### Explanation: \nPayment is the primary reason we work. We are lucky we have the ability to pay debts.\n\n### Input\n>The bank would hold on to the money it had loaned you for as long as they had the money.  The interest rate is what they choose to charge you for borrowing it from them.  The government can sometimes also loan you money.  It\u2019s your job to repay both the government and the bank.  When you stop paying, the money you borrowed becomes debt.  You cannot have debt without also having money.  You don\u2019t pay interest unless you borrow money.  The interest rates the government and the bank choose to use are what they think you can afford to pay for borrowing money.\n\n### Explantion\nIt\u2019s your job to pay back money you loaned.  The person who lends to you keeps the money until they\u2019ve collected all the money you borrowed so you are still paying them.  \n\n### Input,\n>After interest has been paid on money borrowed, how much is left?  Choices:  A)  Nothing  B) Some money C) All the money D) Everything\n\n### Explantion\nInterest is the money you borrow, therefor the interest you pay is money the person you borrowed from keeps/ gets to keep until the full amount is returned.\n\n###Input,\n>Maria had $10 more than she had spent, while Kevin had $10 left. They shared their money equally.  How much did each of them have in the end?  Choices: A: $30 B: $50 C: $60 D: $70\n\n###Explantion\nThe sum of A and B is C. A and B are equal so when they are added, the result has to be exactly double the value of A and B.\n\n###Explanation,\n>When Kevin took $10, and Maria already had $10 and didn\u2019t spend anything else, this left Marnia with $10$10 more than what she had spent(10 and change). Kevin took $10 from $10, so he did not spend either.\n\n###Output,\n>50", "answer": "D: making money"}

I used the simple strategy of subtracting a large number and a small number.  In this question, 300 was a lot larger than 250, so I know 300 is going to be larger than 255.  Therefore, I can subtract larger numbers, 300 and 250, to end up with a solution of 50.  The solution is 50 and there are two solutions.  In the first 50, the population stays the same.  In the second 50, the number of people increases.  There are two solutions to this question as well, 50 + 250 = 300 and -50 + 200 = 30.

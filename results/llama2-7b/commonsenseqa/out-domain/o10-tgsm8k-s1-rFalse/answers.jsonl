If this code looks bad then I will not be surprised because I did this in one hour after I took a long break because of depression. If anyone can help me with this and give me tips about this code, it would be very appreciated.\n\nAnswer: Here are some obvious things that are wrong:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item You haven't declared your variables.\n\\item You've declared the variables after setting values to them.\n\\item Your output is always a fixed string, instead of printing the value of `correct_ans`.\n\\item Some of the numbers you use are off. 3 times as many goats than kangaroo should be 4.\n\\item The question numbers are not in sequence (89 is not next to 95).\n\\end{itemize}\n\nYou can fix these things by doing \\em{some} simple steps:\n\\begin{code}\n\nvoid main()\n{\n\n\\begin{pre}\n\n\t// Your code goes here\n\n\\end{pre}\n\n}\n\\end{code}.\n\nThen, change the output string to `stdout` (just a fancy name for standard output). Something like:\n\n\\begin{code}(cout<<\"Answer: \"<< correct_ans <<endl;)\n\\end{code}(then change the output to the correct answer and change the last newline to a newline).\n\nAfter those two things, your program \\em{should} run with no warnings or errors.  After that, it should be easier to find your issues:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item 10 is not 11!\n\\item The kangaroos is always more than twice as many as the goats\n\\item In some cases, you are using variables you have not declared!\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nI know you think this is a huge issue, but if I can write a program after a depressing brain break (for the record, just got diagnosed with a serious mental illness so excuse the language) then I should be able to do this for you :)", "answer": "C: isolation"}

It's a puzzle I always liked, and I'm 99% sure there's a logical solution to it.\nI've made a very basic attempt to solve the puzzle but I ran out of time before I could produce a correct solution. My solution was based on the fact that the order of the numbers is important so I figured something along the lines of \"If a person was thinking logically, they would take one of the numbers and subtract one from it, then add 13, then subtract 1 again. Repeat this until you have only odd numbers in the sequence left.\" I don't think this is correct for a number of reasons. Maybe the subtraction should occur before the sum? Maybe not? \n\n### Instruciton:Answer the question below\n\n\nWrite a program that reads numbers 1 to 20 then computes the amount of time it takes to move between each adjacent two numbers.

This number is the sum of its digits in a base. So the number 3 is written as the base 3 and the digits 3 in base three. If you add the digits of any digits it yields 3, then the number is written as 3. For example the number 1,200, written in base 11, means the sum of the digits in base 11. So if you sum up the numbers 1,2, and 0, it produces 4. So in base 11 the number 1, is written as 11, 2 is written as 12, and 0 is written as 10. The numbers 1,204, in base 11 are written as 11124. These numbers are written as the digits of the number 31.\nThe digit 3 represents the base number of 11. The digit 4 represents the sum of the digits 2, representing the number 2 in base 11 and 1, representing the number 1 in base 11 to get 3.

Choices:  AM- 10 PM B- 26 hours\n\nIdeas to solve the problem: I would write one algorithm for each problem, but it is better to write one general solution, where I could use the same algorithm for every problem. \n\nSo, for example, the first problem could be solved for example for:\n\nx = amount of remaining stickers   \ny = number of stickers on journal that was used   \nz = number of pages other than  first page in journal(6 in this problem)  \nsolution could be  x = 89 - y - 3 - (6 * x / 7)\n\nThe question is, how to write for this solution also for other problems...\n\nAnswer: For each problem, find some variables. For example, input question is how many remaining stickers, so you define n as amount of remaining stickers. If you need help with variables, use an app [applets](https://www.python.org/pypi/applets). Then divide it into small parts, for example for second problem you will have money and hours of babysitting.\n\nIt is also easier to start with small variables. If you need money, it is easier for you to think about small dollars and cents than dollars. So try to make your problems as simply as possible. Think how can you describe the problem with one formula?\n\nOnce you have found the variables, you define functions\n\n\\begin{code}\nx_change = 3 # change in x\ny_change = 7 # change in y\nz_change = -1 # change in z\nx_start = 89 # original amount of stickers\ny_start = 3 # number of stickers on other pages\nz_start = 6 # number of pages that were used for other purposes (pages)\n\nsolution = n\n\\end{code}\n\nThen you define algorithms\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nWhen you finish your solution, check if any of those variables don't have certain", "answer": "B: oxygen"}

I'd like to fix the car but I know that it's already bad investment. The car has a sticker price of $14,000 but that's just too high.

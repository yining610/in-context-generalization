It's a puzzle I always liked, and I'm 99% sure there's a logical solution to it.<n>I've made a very basic attempt to solve the puzzle but I ran out of time before I could produce a correct solution. My solution was based on the fact that the order of the numbers is important so I figured something along the lines of "If a person was thinking logically, they would take one of the numbers and subtract one from it, then add 13, then subtract 1 again. Repeat this until you have only odd numbers in the sequence left." I don't think this is correct for a number of reasons. Maybe the subtraction should occur before the sum? Maybe not? <n><n>### Instruciton:Answer the question below<n><n><n>Write a program that reads numbers 1 to 20 then computes the amount of time it takes to move between each adjacent two numbers.

You have six pages of notes with 10 problems each, and to answer the problems, you need to calculate what's called the modulus of each number using an exponent.  You can do that by counting the number of digits in the number and then adding the result of the same number but divided by ten.  For example, take the number 10,414.  You know that ten times ten is 100.  When you take ten away from that, the result is 414.  Then you subtract 20 from 414 (giving you 494) and add three (the remainder, giving you 507). You write all six pages with 10 problems on each with 14 digits labeled consecutively as _____. How many labels can you use?<n>Output: 9<n><n>Input: 6.

If I only have $247 in pocket and I have to buy something that is $262, I can do it a step at a time.<n>- If you can find the number you are dividing by in the equation, solve it, then multiply the result in the equation.<n><n>If you know the answer to the hint, skip to the solution.<n><n>---<n><br><n><n>##### Solution<n>---<n>Let's say we have Mary and she buys stickers with stickers.<n>Mary has $89.<n>(1). She had 3 and used it on the front page.<n>(2). She had 7 and used it on 6 pages 4-7.<n>(3). She is left with 44.<n>(4).

These fish have a maximum speed of 20 mph and average 19 mph when swimming. There are another group of fish that average 13 mph when swimming, but can only swim as fast as 12 mph. What is the fastest average speed the two groups of fish can swim together, when swimming as a group of 50 fish?<n>Output: A: 15.2 mph<n><n>Input: A number is written as a base. This number is the sum of its digits in a base. So the number 3 is written as the base 3 and the digits 3 in base three. If you add the digits of any digits it yields 3, then the number is written as 3. For example the number 1,200, written in base 11, means the sum of the digits in base 11. So if you sum up the numbers 1,2, and 0, it produces 4. So in base 11 the number 1, is written as 11, 2 is written as 12, and 0 is written as 10. The numbers 1,204, in base 11 are written as 11124. These numbers are written as the digits of the number 31.<n>The digit 3 represents the base number of 11. The digit 4 represents the sum of the digits 2, representing the number 2 in base 11 and 1, representing the number 1 in base 11 to get 3. Thus the number 31, written in base 3, is 111.<n>How many base numbers, with 5 or more digits, can represent numbers less than 2020?<n><n>Output: A:12221<n><n>Instruction:<n><n>Write an expression for each answer, and submit the string as single row of text.<n>Input: 14<n>Output: 14<n><n>Input: 6<n>Output: 11<n>

For example, input question is how many remaining stickers, so you define n as amount of remaining stickers. If you need help with variables, use an app [applets](https://www.python.org/pypi/applets). Then divide it into small parts, for example for second problem you will have money and hours of babysitting.<n><n>It is also easier to start with small variables.

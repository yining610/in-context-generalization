My calculator has the built-in command SQRX(-7) which will give me the solution for 7. I can also add the square and the X and then square root using the standard RADIANS button (after entering SQRX) and then ROTATE and subtract. My calculator doesn't have X^2-Y^2 as a function but I can use the standard SQRX function (above) and enter Y^2 (with 4) and then ROT to take 4/2. I can then solve the resulting equation as I normally do to determine the square roots. Can you solve a similar problem with a programmable calculators and write a short paragraph to help explain the steps?<n>Output: For a positive value, we could have the equation square plus square root equals the value. For a negative value, the problem would then be negative times the positive value squared, so we would have a negative squared minus a positive value squared, which equals two negatives that are both squared or four positive squared value, that is four times what the square root was and since it is positive the value is all positive.<n><n>### Instuction: Please Answer the Following Two Questions By: Explaining each answer in 1-3 sentences and give a Python code snippet as well for each question.<n><n>Input:"If I want to round my string, how do I go about doing it using a for loop?"<n>Output: I would want to define each letter to the number that will be showing as a percentage<n><n><n>### Instuctiton: Please Read the Question Given Below and Give Answers Like below:<n><n>Input: I need to write a python program to find the least common multiple of 1

How did you know on how to write code to figure out the answer?<n>How long did it take you to solve this?<n>I was first trying with `switch case` so I took about 20 minutes or something like that. After I tried an algorithm of 2 minutes using pen and paper.  <n>This was my first experience with coding so I have to think a lot more before writing code so it definitely took me an hour to do it. (Hackathons usually have 6-8 hours to finish it)<n><n><n>2. Which part would you like to improve on?<n>I think I need to look into more on dynamic programming and recursion to solve bigger problem. Also I should have more efficient way to determine the recursion formula.<n><n>3. This was your first time hacking? Did you finish?<n>Yes, first time at a hackathon. I wasn't sure how to implement recursion first so I just gave up and tried to do the `switch case` way. In the end I tried pen and paper in order to not time out and finish it.<n><n>### Links<n><n>1.

The result is pretty straight forward, but still it can be optimized.<n>- 2nd question, it is pretty easy. We can also get the direct answer by using nested for loop.<n>- 3rd question, nested for loop.<n>  <n>- 4th question, nested for, the nested for condition is also a multiple for selection.<n>- 5th Question, nested for loop, but also can use nested for loop while.<n>  <n>- Use nested for loop for 6th Question.<n>  <n>- If the nested for loop is not enough, try to create your own nested for loop.<n><n>- 7th question, nested for loop, the nested for condition can be the choice selection.<n>- 8th question, nested for while.<n><n>- 9th question, nested for. If the nested for loop cannot satisfy your need, try if. Or if you can. Try to create your own nested IF loop.<n>- 10th question, nested for is enough<n><n>- 11th question, nested for<n><n>- 12th question, nested for selection.<n><n><n><n><n><n>#### **Theory:**<n><n>The purpose of this question is to figure out the loop control. We can also figure it out by recursive function, but in this question we choose the condition.<n>- The first question, the value of "bring home" is not enough to figure out how many times the loop running. We need the total number of chairs in "Blue room" and "Green room" to figure it out.<n><n>Let's choose the room 1 blue chair, 2 green chair, and 3 white chair. In the 3rd choice of blue chair, if "bring home" equals to 3 green chair, we need 2 blue chair, so the for run 3 times.<n>- The second question, the chairs cannot figure out how many times for loop executed. To figure it out, we can compare "bring home", and "white room". If "bring home" less than white room, there are less than "white room" in total. That why we need "bring home" in the beginning, and we also need to count that loop.<n><n>- The third question, we can only compare how many

Companies normally release information about the profits or the losses it has after a specific period like quarterly( for example) or yearly(for example annual reports). B is also another reason why companies share information but what they usually show to the public is what they are doing now, what they have done before, they don't share their intentions and what they plan to do.  Companies normally go public like at the start, when they begin their journey or when they begin to fail.  C is also another good reason companies go public. It's when they are dealing with problems, like lawsuits, or other issues. They show that nothing's wrong to the public and sometimes that's a way to get people to stop being paranoid about the company.<n>Input: An e-commerce web hosting company called Eye is offering a 10% discount for companies choosing to use them to host their e-commerce site.

The graph of `f(x) = ax` would need to be a straight line, starting at, and ending at the origin, with no other points on the line. The graph of `f((x) + (x)` would also need to be a straight-lined graph, again with no other points on this second line.<n><n>The solution is as follows:<n><n>The total number of cards is 256. `Janet` is 12 more than twice as many as `Brerenda`. She has 9 more than 2 times as many as `Brenteda`. She has `f(x) == 2x + 12`. The number of cards that `Brenda` has is `f(x) - 12`, the inverse of `f(x)`, so `Brenda` has 213 cards total.<n><n>The total number must be 500. `Pete` walks 5 blocks. We know he walked 5 blocks because `Pete` came home the same way, meaning he came home along the same path. For the rest of the answer, assume we are walking away from Pete's house and there are 500 blocks total for the entire path. `Pete` rides the bus 20 times. For each ride of the bus, we go 20 times the number of blocks until we get home. 20 is divisible by 5, so `Pete` comes home by riding the

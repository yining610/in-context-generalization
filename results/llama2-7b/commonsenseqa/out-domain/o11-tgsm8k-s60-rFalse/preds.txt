Write a response to each of the following directives.<n><n>### Directive: 1: <n>In the 1960's and mid 1970's, the US government had an active and expensive effort to promote immigration. One argument was that a country's prosperity would be enhanced by allowing highly skilled people to come work in the country. The government of the United States had a law called the H-1B. The law was to allow a large number of new employees to work in the US. Many people complained that the H-1B program was taking low-income jobs away from native-born Americans. <n>Write an essay that explains how to decide whether or not the H1B program was having the anticipated effect.<n><n>### Example Essay:<n>In the 1060's and 70's a large number of immigrants flocked to the US, taking away many jobs from native US workers because of the H1B program. The amount of low income families going up because of the jobs lost was very low so it caused more harm for the native US citizens.<n><n>### Written Response: <n>In the late 1960s and 1970s, the US government implemented an act called the H-1b program. This act allowed for foreigners to have easy access to jobs in the US and take the job away from the native born citizens. At that time many complained that the H1B program took away many jobs from the native born Americans. At first the H1B program allowed for many to come to the US and get jobs in the US that used to be held by native US citizens. However it created large number of low wage workers. To decide how to solve the issue of jobs taken away from the native US workers

He has three plots: one plot for green beans, one plot for carrots, and one plot for corn.

Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n><n>### Response:		<n>Exercise. If you exercise, you should get energy out of it. This might be easier for a muscle-head, but if you are tired, it is the best thing to do.<n><n>### Input<n>You should never waste time if you have 5 hours before your test.<n><n>### Response<n>I disagree with this statement. If you have 7 hours to study, you can waste time if you feel it is a waste of your time. Time wasting is usually wasteful when you have no time to do what you need to do. I also think that time "feels" wasted when you get it done in less than the time. Time in our society is based on the unit and measurement of dollars. <n><n>In terms of the 5-hour test, I see this statement as inaccurate in most cases. Some tests will take less time than 5 hours. Some tests will take more than 5 hours. The time is only an estimate of the expected time for the test. So, you should never waste time if there is no time limit because you can't accurately predict the time it would take you to complete the test. You should waste time because it is your time, and you can do whatever you please to accomplish what you want to get done.<n><n>### You make an error in your work. If you catch this error quickly, then it won't be hard to fix.<n><n>### Reponse<n>Because you've spent most of the day being busy, the idea of taking the day off is appealing to you.<n><n>### Reply: <n>I agree with this. Many people find it hard to take a day off because of being busy while doing work. If you are busy working, it is easy to neglect that you have a day off, and you should be resting. You may find that relaxing is harder because you are still busy and have to get work done. You should have days off, or you will get burned out of work.<n><n>### Question: <n>A: The average distance you drive per day in your car, in miles is x.<n>How could the statement be changed to avoid this?<n>B:  One of the two lines contains a word that is repeated twice, once as one of the synonyms. It is a word that you use to describe someone who runs. What is the word?<n>

This means that if we put a specific input into a function, we will then get one specific output - this is called as a mapping.  For example, we can draw a mapping called "number guessing game" which tells us what would be our guess after we tell it how many guesses we should have. In the case of this function, for each input we put in, we would get a specific output.<n><n>### Functions Example<n><n>In a game of Rock-Scissors-Paper, if a player's Rock beats another player's Paper, then there is a 33.3% chance that the second players Paper beats the first player's Scissors. There is only a 33.8% change that Paper wins the match and there is a 32.9% chance that Scissors wins a draw. In short, we can show the odds of winning as below and they are all functions because we have one output for each input given.<n><n>A: Paper is 1,389.1 to 1 compared to Rock<n><n>B: Scissors is 302.6 to 3 compared to Paper<n><n>C: Rock is 644.2 to 1 compared to Scissors<n><n>D: Paper is 7 to 2 compared to Scissors (if one player flips Paper before Scissors)<n><n>E: Scissors is a 2 to 3 chance of a draw with (Paper,Scissors,Rock)<n><n>### Input  : Which  of the following values is an example of exponentiation? Choices: A: (100)^0.3 B: (1)^0.

In my free time, I usually play games on my computer. My current favorite game is League of Legends. This game can be played on a single computer in the same room as 9 other computers, so it can be played by 2 people who are in different locations. This game is free to download and play. The most important thing to get good at this game is to practice everyday with new strategies and with old friends. I am not a very good player, but practice makes you a better. The second thing to being a good player is to have a good teammate, for example, people that can help you win a game. That’s it, I hope you enjoyed reading, that’s the end for my explanation.<n><n>

We determine that Janet has 79 more cards than Branda by subtracting 79 from Janet's cards and then adding 79 to Brenda's cards. This means that the sum of their cards is greater than the sum of their cards by 79. In the second problem, Pete was told that his journey total was 125. In the second problem it's assumed that he rode the bus less than 20 blocks. This doesn't always make sense, because if he'd have rode the bus a shorter distance, this would mean that he walked a longer distance than we are told. He might have been told to leave home at 9:00am to go to the post office to pick up the stamps then go to the post office. This should have been the first step of his journey. The second question involves counting and adding integers; the third question involves counting and making pints out of a fraction. The fourth question deals with counting and multiplying integers; the fifth question involves counting again and adding. The sixth question involves counting and multiplying fractions; the seventh and eighth questions involve counting and addition. The ninth question involves counting, adding, and subtraction; the tenth question involves counting, subtraction, division, and addition. The eleventh question involves counting, subtracting and dividing; the twelfth question involves counting subtracting, and dividing. The thirteenth is subtraction, division and counting; the fourteenth is subtraction and dividing.<n><n>### Disclaimer:<n><n>### The solution was built at [2021 Coding Bootcamp](

The idea of a task was to solve for a number in the context of an interesting and complex question and then answer with data that the students can relate to. In some of the examples, the correct response was based on an assumption that went unstated. For instance, there is no explanation in the task of what "dull" means. Or why there were no numbers associated with each individual character - like "3 other people and 3 other individuals". I think this adds in a layer of complexity - something that I think is a good idea as math is inherently about rigor rather than memorization.<n><n>### Assessment<n><n>---<n><n>### Suggestions for improvement<n><n>---<n><n>I wanted to make sure that the tasks and how they are answered could be understood without additional materials. To help ensure this, I'll be adding images of the answers to my solution files that the students saw on the whiteboard.<n><n>---<n><n>My next iteration would be to add more questions to this activity and more practice with these types of questions. Since I have more practice questions, I would be inclined to reorganize and add more variety in the order of tasks and questions.<n><n>---<n>

The woman lost. In the 2016 election, the Republican party could only find a man to represent them. That would mean that if a woman ran as a Republican in 2018, she would be the party with no representation on the national ticket. But in 2016 there was a woman on the Republican national ticket. How is that possible?<n><n># 13:<n><n>The United States has two major political parties. One of them is the Republican Party. The other is the Democratic Party. When a person runs for president, one of them will run against that person. One of those parties is the Democratic Party. The other one is the Republican Party. If the Democratic Party wants to nominate its presidential candidate, it has to have a primary. There are three major states that hold primaries. They are Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.

Because of his mistake, he spent 8 years somewhere. Where was he? Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question is ambiguous - what does "somewhere" mean? Ben could be in jail, prison, a bridge, his father's home, a neighbor's home, a homeless shelter, the hospital, a locked room, or a place his wife doesn't want him. I will answer that Ben spent 8 years in a homeless shelter after a motorcycle accident when he was drunk.<n><n>### Note<n>To make this less confusing, you can use the built-in `where` function to replace the word "somewhere":<n>```ruby<n>puts "Ben was an alcohol. He spent ___________ after a motorcycle accident".where('A','B','C','D')<n>puts "Ben spent 8 years in ___________ because of his mistake. What was it?" where('E','A','B','C')<n>```<n>### Output:<n>Ben was an alcohol after a motorcycle accident.<n><n>In a homeless shelter because of his mistake.  What was it?<n>Ben spent 8 years homeless after a motorcycle accident because of his mistake.<n><n>### Extra Credit: (A.k.a. the more fun part)<n>If you want to play with the code a little bit, you can add a new method to the program with a name, and then put it in a file by itself with no file extension.<n><n>### Explanations:<n><n>Here's what our program will do. `input` takes a string and splits it into an array using the split method.

Choices:  A: dimly lit room B: kitchen C: wall D: table E: birthday cake<n><n>### Response:		<n>If the candle were to be placed in the kitchen, it would definitely be on the wall. However, it doesn't really make sense, it is a lot more common to have birthday cake in the kitchen (especially if the restaurant is a Mexican restaurant, that is where you would likely put your birthday cake). Another good option is the table because birthday cake is a tradition and also it is placed in between 2 or 4 people so it can be evenly shared between each person at the table, which includes 2-4 children if the birthday cake is for them. You should pick birthday cake because the main intention of birthday cake is to be eaten, which is why it would be put in between other guests at the table. For dimly lit rooms, candles are not usually put in rooms because they are too sensitive. Wall would be the best option because they are inaccessible to children, or a place were the guest would not be able to knock it down. Lastly, candles are used in a birthday cake, in the kitchen, and most often it would be placed on the table.<n><n><n>### Instructions: Write a sentence or story that uses information from the instructions and response.

The candle's location should be able to give the guests a better experience, that is why it needs to be put in a place where it can be accessible to them. Another thing is if the candle is too distant from the guests, then they won't be able to see it. <n><n>### Assignments: <n>- The students can ask for a classmate that does not understand the assignment and ask them to explain it.<n>- Students have to explain the information and use it as a basis for their response to the prompt: What does the information say? <n><n>### Checklist: Check 3 things the

Maras has 6 more cards than Janet, which is twice as many cards as Brenda. The cards together are equal to 18 more than 150. This means Janet has 26 more cards than Brenda, and Mara has 18 more cards than Janet. Janet has 44 more cards than Brenda and Mara, and together they have 142 cards. But remember, Janet has 2 more cards than Mara. Therefore the cards together are 144. Each person has 44 more than the person before them. Therefore, Brenda has 13. Next, Mara has 39 more cards than Brenta. So she would be 41 more. That means Brenda has 52 and that means Mara has 84 cards, and together they have a total of 136 cards. Remember how Janet was more than Mara? So Janet must have 46 cards. Therefore, Brenda and Mara had 88 cards that Janet had 46 more. If you add that number to the number of cards Brenda, Mara, and Janet together had, you

Let's say in the example the greater index of [AAAABCCDDDDEEEEEFF] is F.  With an array of 23 elements, the first index is 0, the second is 1, the third is 2, and so on; the last index is 16.  Thus, 16 is the greatest index of the array, because 16 + 1 is 17, which exceeds 23.  Therefore, the greatest index of the example is F, because [FFF] is the last letter.  The second greatest index of the example (after F) is A, because [FFFF] is the fifth letter, which does not exceed 23.<n><n>A possible way to arrange the example is<n><n>[AAAAC]CEE[CDDCDEEEEEF]<n><n>in which [EEEEEEF] becomes the last element.  The first two elements are ordered so that the first index is largest among all elements.  By the formula above, 16 - A = 3, so A is the first element, [CCCD], and 16 - C = 3, so C is the last element, [DDDDDD].<n><n>The key is remembering which element has the highest index at any one point, and arranging the elements so that the highest index is placed at the first position and the next highest is placed at the

Then the found a great house which fits all their needs and they like the owner. Jenny asks the owner to write down the rent, and the rent for the next 12 months is equal to 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2,... (the rent for the n-th month is equal to the 2 n). The owner answered Jenny like "I need to think about it" after that Jenny said "I will give you $1 for each question, if we can't rent that I need your help to solve it I have $10 to start with and I gave you my 50% of money because I don't like it as much as you, I ask for your 40% help to solve it now, Marry needs 30% of the total rent. If you can't solve it then I will ask the next person after you until we find a solution. The problem is that we all know that the owner is greedy.

That means there are 21 cards in all.<n><n>| Input      | Input        | Output            | Solution   |<n>| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------ | :-------- |<n>| Pete      | Houston       | 50                | 50        |<n>| Houston    | Houston       | 45                 | 95        |<n>| Houston     | garage       | 50                 | 100       |<n>| garage     | post office | 40                  | 40        |<n><n>We start with our inputs and add them together with the word "in all". We have 50 + 45 + 50 + 35 = 170.<n><n>To get the output we subtract 35 (the number of gallons the bus holds) from 50 (the distance the bus traveled). It is the 2 trips Pete made plus the distance of 20 blocks to get to the post office.<n><n>| Input       | Input        | Output         | Solution    |<n>| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- | :---------- |<n>| 4.5        | gallons       | pint           |  pints       |<n>| 3         | thermoses     | pint            |  pints       ||<n>| 6         | pints         | quart           |  quarts       ||<n><n>So, we know both Genevieve and her friend have 4 quarters and that they both have 4. The only case is for their 3 thermoses, but that must be wrong because Genevieve's friend has twice as many quarts as Genevieve. But Genevieve has twice as many quarters as her friend! Thus, both have an extra quart of coffee.<n><n>| Input         | Input        | Output        | Solution     |<n>| ------------- | ------------- | ------------    | :--------- |<n>| 10           | Berries        | 18             | 18         |

She has $78 in her pocket. How many half gallons of milk can Amy buy?<n><n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Solution<n><n><n>Amy buys milk on a daily basis. Amy buys milk each day at the groceree where a half gallon has a price of $1.75, while a whole gallon costs at $3.50 a glass. Amy has $78 in cash. How many half gallon glasses of milk can Amy buy on a daily basis? Because half gallon of milk is equal to two pints, Amy can buy $2.95 in half gallon glasses in every day. On a daily basis, Amy can buy $5.90 in pints of milk. Her daily earnings can be determined by multiplying each pints by six. At first, we know that half gallon is equal to two pins. $1.75 for half a gallon means $1.75 per pint. $1.72 multiplied by two equals to $3.44, which means she can buy $3.4

One day, he found a nice, round, red and blue rock; and he took it home to share with his wife.  When he got home, his wife, who was a homely little lobster with a flat body, was standing in the doorway looking very much surprised and happy. The little lobster handed her the rock.

So the seven years doesn't mean the value will double after seven years, but after seven years, the value is double or even triple. Since it is a doubling effect, I don't think the number $40M is correct.<n>### Response to James:<n>My suggestion would be, instead of answering every questions, try to read the whole question in the first place.

They are spaced 3 ft apart and connected to the frame by arms the length of 15 ft. The distance from the ground of the rover to the top of each arm, in total, is 16.5 inches.  The arms have a 90 degree bend at the joint, where the 6 wheels meet, then the arms straighten out again.  The height of the bend in each arm is equal to the width of its wheel.  The width is 23 inches to allow for easier travel around objects (trees, etc.) on the planet.  The bend of each arm is at a point of 22.5 inches along the length of the arm itself.  We measured the wheels, arms, rover, the space between the wheels and the ground and were able to compute the following:  Height, 17 inches width 26 inches, 2

As a teen, a car comes with a learning curve, a lot of responsibility, and a lot of risk. The most prevalent risks for younger motorists are those who are going to be the most significant. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data from 2010, teenage drivers ages 15 to 18 have a greater risk of car accidents than older motorists, accounting for 202 fatalities every year. In fact, 15-year-olds have the most fatal car accidents per mile driven, while 18-year-olds have 44% of their deaths in an accident, implying that accidents become less frequent as they get older. The fatal crash rate per mile driven is also higher for teenage drivers than other motorists. What is the total amount of money needed to build a house? There are many ways to approach building a house, but one of the most obvious starting points of each structure is the foundation.

My calculator has the built-in command SQRX(-7) which will give me the solution for 7. I can also add the square and the X and then square root using the standard RADIANS button (after entering SQRX) and then ROTATE and subtract. My calculator doesn't have X^2-Y^2 as a function but I can use the standard SQRX function (above) and enter Y^2 (with 4) and then ROT to take 4/2. I can then solve the resulting equation as I normally do to determine the square roots. Can you solve a similar problem with a programmable calculators and write a short paragraph to help explain the steps?\nOutput: For a positive value, we could have the equation square plus square root equals the value. For a negative value, the problem would then be negative times the positive value squared, so we would have a negative squared minus a positive value squared, which equals two negatives that are both squared or four positive squared value, that is four times what the square root was and since it is positive the value is all positive.\n\n### Instuction: Please Answer the Following Two Questions By: Explaining each answer in 1-3 sentences and give a Python code snippet as well for each question.\n\nInput:\"If I want to round my string, how do I go about doing it using a for loop?\"\nOutput: I would want to define each letter to the number that will be showing as a percentage\n\n\n### Instuctiton: Please Read the Question Given Below and Give Answers Like below:\n\nInput: I need to write a python program to find the least common multiple of 1", "answer": "C: being mean"}

How did you know on how to write code to figure out the answer?\nHow long did it take you to solve this?\nI was first trying with `switch case` so I took about 20 minutes or something like that. After I tried an algorithm of 2 minutes using pen and paper.  \nThis was my first experience with coding so I have to think a lot more before writing code so it definitely took me an hour to do it. (Hackathons usually have 6-8 hours to finish it)\n\n\n2. Which part would you like to improve on?\nI think I need to look into more on dynamic programming and recursion to solve bigger problem. Also I should have more efficient way to determine the recursion formula.\n\n3. This was your first time hacking? Did you finish?\nYes, first time at a hackathon. I wasn't sure how to implement recursion first so I just gave up and tried to do the `switch case` way. In the end I tried pen and paper in order to not time out and finish it.\n\n### Links\n\n1.

We can also figure it out by recursive function, but in this question we choose the condition.\n- The first question, the value of \"bring home\" is not enough to figure out how many times the loop running. We need the total number of chairs in \"Blue room\" and \"Green room\" to figure it out.\n\nLet's choose the room 1 blue chair, 2 green chair, and 3 white chair. In the 3rd choice of blue chair, if \"bring home\" equals to 3 green chair, we need 2 blue chair, so the for run 3 times.\n- The second question, the chairs cannot figure out how many times for loop executed. To figure it out, we can compare \"bring home\", and \"white room\". If \"bring home\" less than white room, there are less than \"white room\" in total. That why we need \"bring home\" in the beginning, and we also need to count that loop.\n\n- The third question, we can only compare how many", "answer": "A: attic"}

We want the sum of Janet's and Margo's cards to get 254 less than half of 160.\nNow we calculate Margo's cards and leave Brenda's. This is because Brenda doesn't have her cards. (We can ignore her because she is 9 cards behind.)\nMargo has 2 more than the 9 that Janet has.\nThe sum of their cards are 25 more than half of 154.\nSo, Margo's cards are 10 times what Janet has, which is 2 more than 9.\nNow, Janet's 10 times what Margo has is 9 cards more than 10, which is 29.\nThe sum is 45 cards.\nHence, Janet got 45 cards more less than Margo.\n\nMara also has 45 cards less than 160. (256-9 = 247.)\nHence, Janets and Margo have 164 cards in all.\n\nB. Pete traveled for 58 blocks. It was 50 blocks to the postoffice.\nIt took 35 blocks to go home.

{"text": "E\n```\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\n```\nInput: You have an integer x and a negative integer y. Subract y from x. Write the sum as a power of 10.  \nIf x=19, y=5, sum=14, power=10^3\n\n\nExplanation: You start at 10^x (for which the exponent is x). You subtract the sum of y, which is 5. Then you subtract from the exponent of \"10^x\" the sum of y, 5, which is 10^3.\n\nx=19, y=-7, sum=14 =>  xpower(10) = 10^19     xpower(10)^-7 = 10^(-19) =>  xpower(9.1) = (10^19)^(-7)  -> 1.091e28 \n\nInput: You are given two non-negative integers \"a\" and \"c\". a has a power greater than 10. a^c has a power less than 10.  Compute the absolute minimum of a^c\n\nExplanation and input: In this question each integer is written as a power of 2. I would make a note of the decimal expander, and then convert all inputs to powers of 2, so that the question can be solved in parallel.\n\na =7.38 => a^c=4.8e9  < 8.46e5   a^c=0.86e20  < 0.9e20   a^c=1.13e20 > 1e20\n\nOutput a^c = 1.13e+20    1.13e10  < 2e7   1.13e5  < 20e2   1.13 > 1.1\n```\n\n## Problem 3\n``` \nInstuction:Write a python function.

The graph of `f(x)\u00a0= ax` would need to be a straight line, starting at, and ending at the origin, with no other points on the line. The graph of `f((x) + (x)` would also need to be a straight-lined graph, again with no other points on this second line.\n\nThe solution is as follows:\n\nThe total number of cards is 256. `Janet` is 12 more than twice as many as `Brerenda`. She has 9 more than 2 times as many as `Brenteda`. She has `f(x) == 2x +\u00a012`. The number of cards that `Brenda` has is `f(x) - 12`, the inverse of `f(x)`, so `Brenda` has 213 cards total.\n\nThe total number must be 500. `Pete` walks 5 blocks.

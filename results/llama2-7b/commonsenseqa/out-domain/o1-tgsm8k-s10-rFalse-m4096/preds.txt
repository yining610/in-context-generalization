### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input:Behind what small door are canned goods usually kept in? Choices:  A: cabinet B: pantry C: kitchen D: cupboard E: shelf<n>Output:		Answer should be pantry<n><n>#1. Calculate the total amount that Adam spent for the purchases.<n>#2. Find out the correct answer for question A above - what is can goods usually kept behind?<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>In the first place, Adam wanted to use `2x + 10` so for him $2x=10$.<n><n>In question 1, the total cost of the purchased goods was $140, I got this by dividing 12 and 8 each times. We can easily find out the total cost by asking for the total of all the quantities bought and the total price.<n>Since the total cost of the goods purchased was $140. Afterwards, we ask him for the number he got as a result of the division. So, Adam bought 3 kilogram of nuts and 3 kilogram of dried fruits, that means the number of nuts was 3.<n><n>The total amount of nuts were costing him by $12, that is the price per kilogram was $12/3. We divided this by 3 to get our answer. The same thing we should do for the dried fruits.<n>So, our result is 140/3=46.6, we have to round this to 3 decimal so you get, 46.6 + 3 = 46.63<n><n>The second question is not so easy. This part of the question required us to think carefully.<n><n>#2. Answer to the second question.<n><n>The first step is to figure out the meaning of the letters of the answer. So, first we must ask the user, "what is the capital letter of the first letter of the word". We cannot assume because it is not what the question requires and it will only frustrate in case we are wrong.<n><n>In the second step, I tried to find out the best way to do these questions.<n>I decided to figure out the best way to proceed by giving this:<n><n>B: pantry <n><n>C: kitchen<n><n>D: cupboard<n><n>E: shelf<n><n>This is because I think I should answer in alphabetical order in case there are more sentences. Otherwise, I should ignore the alphabetical order and then try to figure out the meaning. I am glad, the code that my mentor provided me worked

Try to eliminate choices that are unreasonable (like having one of the options $0)<n><n>## Solution 1<n><n>The simplest approach I had come to think of so far was to make use of the fact that the order doesn\'t matter. <n>So just generate the possible combinations for both choices and do a bfs on two trees, with the one tree being the choices and the others being the possible paths between the two choices.<n>Because it doesn\'t matter which choice you choose first, you can also do a DFS on the other tree.<n><n>Now a bfs can be solved using a recursion technique where the root is only traversed once with the children of the root getting recursively visited.<n>Lets say the root is (X, Y) and the value of X or Y is equal to 0, this means we can stop traversing the other choice because all values in the DFS tree will be greater than 0.<n>In terms of the recursion:<n><n>```python<n>    def f(path, visited):<n>    if path not in visited: # if the next level hasn\'t been explored<n>        print path<n>        for choice in paths[path]:<n>            path.append(choice)<n>            visited.add(path)<n>        f(path, visited)<n>```<n><n>Lets start at the first level first, as it is faster since at any given point we only have 4 possible choices (2 for each child). So we first only do:<n>For all X in range(2):<n>    For all Y in range(2):  <n>            x,y = (x,y) # our child choice<n>            f(path + [x], visited)<n>```<n>Now the recursive function calls the same function one more level, we add one more child (the last one) at each level until we get to the 4th and final level.<n>The reason why we have to iterate through this level is because each of the children

The result will be the actual number raised to that power. For example, `48 = 2^3` for `pow(2,3)`. The `pow()` function takes just two numbers  and raises the first to the power of the second. Try it yourself.  Suppose you call `pow(8, 2)` What will the output be?

What value must you pass to start the sequence?  Remember, you will be using `start` and `iterate()` to start the sequence   and iterate it.  The sequence created at the end will have the same values as the sequence returned when you created it.  The Fibonacci sequence created by this  sequence will be a list like `fibs = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 2], [5, 3], [8, 5]]`. How can you create a sequence that will return a  list containing Fibonacci values?  Choices: A: use the `iterate()` and `start` arguments B: `start([1])` + `iterate()` C: `start(iterate([2,3]))` + `add()` D: `start(iter` + `add()` E: `start(add([3,2]))` + `iterate`<n>Output: B<n>

What we have is a string in the input and we know that we want the second half to equal the first half. As we can see, the string "mommy" is actually very simple and is the solution to the problem.<n>First, we start with the string in the input we get. For example: if "mommy" was our input, we will start with this string to begin the problem.<n><n>```<n>101,100,10,-1<n>```<n><n>Let say we get the input "mom". First, we can see that the length of the string "mom" is 4. Then, we start with the second half and try to make it equal as the first half. So in our case, our 2nd half will be of length 3 and we can see that the string we form is all different. Therefore, we try another idea to form a second string.<n><n>```<n>*101,1,99,9<n>```<n>Now, let us go back to the idea of making the 2nd half to be the same as the first half. Let us start with the second half then and try to make it into the first one. We are forming a string and we want it to be the same as our input. Now, we know it is not the same yet. As we start, it is not in the correct format and only has 3 digits. To be as same as our input, we need 4 digits.<n><n>```<n>  *************<n><n>* 101,11,99,

When I say input I mean any valid int input type with no negative values. When I mean choices I mean any string(list is fine) with 6(input) values. In your program, you will be creating a new list called answers from an input and a chooses list. For example, let us say the input was 8 and this is an example choice list "8,6,5,4,1,0". We want to create the list "True" for all values that are less than the input minus one which is 3(4, 3, 2 which satisfy this expression) and to only create True for the last value(which is 0) and False for all other values. Thus your answers could look like this:A: 8 B: 7 C: 6 D: 5 E: 0 F: 1<n><n>### Instruction:<n>For this code practice problem your program should be a recursive function that takes an input and a list(or any iterable) of choices. It should return a list of 5 choices(or a dictionary for the answers) where one of those choices is true and the rest are false. An example input and choice list would be 8 and this list of choices: "6,5,4", where your output would be "True,False,False,True,False,False". The first three values of input that satisfy the problem should get True and be True. The remaining values will be False. Your input does not return input.<n><n><n>### Input Examples<n>### Your Output:<n>### Sample Output:<n>### Requirements<n>### Submitting an Assignment<n>#### Problem<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>##### Function<n>

In English we say that to solve a problem you first get rid of all the variables; you solve for a variable when all variables are gone (except for one) and you have an equation.\nSo I first removed all variables from the problem and got\n0*3 = 0\n0/5 = 0\n0*k = 0 and d = 0\nThen with my math I got\nk = 0 and 2d = 0\nThus, this is it for the first part.\n\n-3.Since I know both the two sides are equal that means all the variables equal to each other.\n\nI. I have 3 variables: x, y, z.\nII. Both the 3 variable are equal.\nIII. If the statement says if all the variable is equal then it means that all 3 are equal to each other. So I get the variable x will equal the variables y and z\nX = y and z\n\nIV. Since it says all the variables are equal, which means both x and y are equal and so z also equals x.\nz = x\n\nThen by using I & III the equation x = y and z = x can be written as:\nx + x = 2x\nor\n2x = x + x\nor\n2x + 2x = 2*x\nor 4x = 2x\nThe answer is 4x = 4x and we get x = 2\n\n-4.I have 2 variables K & n\nK = 0 and n = 36\n(k- n) = n-k\nBy substitution i.e.\n0 - 36 = 36-0\nor\nk-n = 36-k\nor\n2k = 36\nor k = 18\n\n-5.I have the variables x & y\n1.27y = 1.27x\nor 1.27 *", "answer": "D: take money"}

Which of the following will happen in the future? A) People will eventually make more houses B) People will move into caves eventually C) People will probably always prefer caves D) People will live in caves for eternity\nOutput: A\n \n### Solution:\n\n* The process involved is,\n\nTo get the combined ages of Richard and Hurley, we have to subtract the age of Hurley from the Richard\u2019s age (because that would be the difference). Let\u2019s say the Richard\u2019s age is X and Hurley\u2019s age is Y. We have,\n\nX - Y = 20\n\nNow, Hurley is 11 old. So, Hurley\u2019s age in 20 years should be 31. Hence, Richard\u2019s age should be 41.\n\nSo, 41 - X = 20\n \nX = 21\n \nThus 41 - 21 = 20 is right answer.\n \n* So in the second question, the price of the book per page is 1 cent because we need to divide 150 by $0.01 which is a number of page needed to get $0.15.\n\nSo, reading a $0.15 book costs 15 cents. Hence, in order to save $15, we have to read 100 books because 15 cents * 100= $15.\n \n* The solution for the third question is,\n\nThe friend Aurelia can buy 70% of things in $10 which is 0.7*10= $7. So, she could have bought only $4 worth of things from the total amount.\n \n* In the fourth question, 132 is the remaining cash because we subtract initial cash before purchasing drinks \u2013 number of drinks.\n \n* Here the initial cash is 240 and number of drinks = 1.", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

(For example, the squares of the first seven positive integers, counting from 1 itself, equal 1 \u00d7 1 + 2 \u00d7 2 + 3 \u00d7 3 + 4 \u00d7 4 + 5 \u00d7 5 + 6 \u00d7 6 + 7 \u00d7 7, so 48,385 is the sum of their squares.) Explain how it works!\nOutput: The numbers are arranged in rows, like so:\n\nThe numbers in the first row add up to 48 (a square):\n\nThe numbers in row 2 add up to 71 (also a square).\n\nThe numbers in each subsequent row are the sums of the two rows below it, squared.\n\nThe first two numbers (plus 1, the number of rows they're in) add up to 492 = 64\u00b2, and 890 = 100\u00b2 and so on until they reach 48,371\u00b2. Each row squared adds 64, for a total of 387 (squared) - 64, because the first row is special.\n\nNow it's time to add the sums.\n\n492 + 890 + 961 + 509 + etc equals 48,275, which is the same as 492 squared minus 64 = 48,211.\n\nSo 48,325 is the number added by squaring the numbers of the rows - 64.", "answer": "E: university"}

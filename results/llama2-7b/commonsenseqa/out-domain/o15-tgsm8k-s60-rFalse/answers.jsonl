(n=1=8/2=16/2=32/2=62/2=120/2=203/2...). This means you will need to read in each number and print the nth term for that sequence.\nHint: To find the nth term, use this expression:\n-nth term = (15)(23) [0/2] [n-1/2] + (16)(24) [0/2][n-1/2](24) + [0/2] + [(n-1/2)/2]\nSolutions: [15][7] + [0/2][15] + 9 = 1[15][7]/2 + 7/2 = 17/2 = 885/2\n-1/2 = 0\n0/2 = 0/2\n(1/2) [0] = 0\n(1/2)[4/2] = 2\n(1/4)[-8/32] = -2\n-8/32 = -1/4\nSo, the second term is 885/4 = 2213/4\n-3/4 = -1\n-1/4 = -20\n52/23 = 6\n6/23 = 1\n1/23 = 0\n2/23 = -20/2\n-4/23 = -1\n-2/23 = (1/23) - 1 = 0\n5/23 = 2\n\n\n### Question:\n\n#### Instruction:\n\nRead in the two numbers and output an if statement with", "answer": "C: being found out"}

The most important thing to consider is that you have a full day to ride on the ship. Otherwise, the ship will return to port and you may end up stranded in an unknown place with no friends, and no boat, for the rest of your life. 2. If there are 52 passengers on the ship as there are this week, it is better to split the number 284 into a number and half of it. If there are 60 passengers, then you can split the number into 309 and a quarter each of this number is half. So, you do not need to think more about the number, you just need to split the number 309, which is half of 604. 3. Then you need to multiply your chosen number times your chosen number (in either case). This will give you the number of times you must shake the card to give all the 52 cards to the other person. If one of the two games was to play 4, but 632, it is very important to remember the answer to the other game. This is to know the order of the cards. The same would also apply next Saturday if the game is not played on the same day next week. 4. I think that it is good to split the number you were given 309 so you don't have to think about what the number is. Then you just need to multiply the number by your chosen number (in the case of 6 as 309). This gives you your number of times you must move the cards so they are face up again.

I know, this would be an amazing situation. Now, think of a large amount of people, say, 28. How likely are you to get good responses? Now, this isn't a probability question, or even an integer question. It is about fractions. We're going to add fractions. We have 9 in the numerator and 8 in the denominator. The answer is 3/5. Is it closer to 3/5 or 9/8? This is the same as the question, \"What makes 3/5 smaller when you add more and more to the numerator, and what makes 9/8 bigger?\" I hope you figured this out.

{"text": "Input:What is the largest integer that is less than 5 but greater than 0?\nOutput:\n\n\n## Solutions:\n\nAnswer: You have several problems. You have a 90% passing rate for the multiple choice questions. You have a 10% failing rate for the programming questions. I don't know anyone who does better than 85% on multiple choice and worse than 85% in programming.\n\nHere are the changes I would suggest:\n\n* When grading the multiple choice, if 4 people got at least half right, then all get 10. No one knows 90% of these answers.\n\n* When graded the programming portion, if 3/4 of the class made 80%, then anyone who completed it gets 5. Anyone who never attempted should be given 5 as well. This question should not be worth at least 75% of your grade. It should be a minimal 5%.\n\n* When gradating the programming section, anyone who just wrote an unacceptable solution (and I recognize that the programming portion was tough) should be given a 0 for their total grades. Then you can use the mean to find which answer is the top one. For instance, suppose 5 people got it right, 10 people got something on the way but wasn't right, and everyone else got it all way wrong. They should get a 0. They are learning here. In contrast, people who do the least amount of work or write crappy programs should get ZERO also because they are not learning.\n\n* When the answers are not found, you should tell them all. You should tell that they had about a 20-25% chance of getting it on the first try, so the real questions is why 60-70% are not getting it. Also, you should make clear that programming is really a trial and error process where you often have to run through half a dozen variants before you get it right.\n\n\n* Make clear to them that getting the programming answers is worth 5% of their grade - the smallest possible. No way is this question worth 75%. I would expect the programming questions to be worth at most 10% of their final grades.\n\n* The programming assignments should not be worth more than 10%, but you should", "answer": "E: closet"}

{"text": "Graveyard\n\n## Instruction: Please answer the following short questions\n\n### Short Answer Question:Why is it easier to multiply or divide a number by a power of 10 than by a number itself?\n\nYou'd think that multiplying by a power of 2, such as 8, would be easier than multiplying by a single number. If you're doing it in your brain, you can actually do both quite well once you've established memorized multiplication tables. \n\nHowever, if you're doing computer arithmetic, doing a multiply by 326 would be about 326 times more expensive (in terms of CPU cycles) than doing a multiply by 2 and simply increasing all the numbers by 16.\n\n### Short Question:If you multiply a negative number by a negative number will you get a positive number?\n\nMultiplying two negatives produces a positive number. Addition gives us a negative integer, and so does subtraction, while multiplication always yields a positive integer.\n\n### Why can't we use the inverse operation when using division?\n\nYou CAN use the inverse property of division to perform division, but you do so at your peril. The division property is only valid when both arguments are positive, but if you perform what seems to be a valid division operation on negative numbers, you'll get a negative integer as the result instead. So if both sides are positive, using the division property works just fine.", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}

If Mara has 150 cards, how many cards do they have altogether?\n\n##### Solution\nWe know that Janet has 9 and 12 times as much cards as Brenda and Mara respectively. Therefore from what we were given we have to take the 9 and the 12 and subtract the 150 and we are gonna get 211.\n\t\n\t\tJanet has 9 and Mara has 211 to make 300\n\n##### Example:\nWhat is an even multiple of 7?\n- We can take 7 and multiply it by 2 or divide it by 2\n\n##### Solution :\nIf we divided it by 2, the answer we get is 35, if we multiplied it by 2 we get 14\n\n##### Example :\nThe number of gallons of regular gas is 10% less than what was needed. The number of gallons of premium gas is two thirds as much as regular gas. The total amount of gas needed is 138. How many gallons of regular gas should have been used? \n\n##### Solution:\nSubtract the regular gas:138\nRegular gas is 10 % lower,we should find which one is less \nSubtract 10% : 138 - \nSubtract and set as x:119\n\n##### Example 2:\nHow many students must be in a class if there are 5 less than 10% more than 15% more than 14% of the students are girls?", "answer": "C: california"}

The complexity of an algorithm with respect to N (the input length, or any other measure of the size of the input) is O(f(N)) = \u0398(f(N)).[a] This is a big-\u0398 notation.[b] This notation indicates the asymptotical growth rate for a function f(N). The actual running time of the algorithm always grows slower than O(f(N)), but the rate of slowing down as N becomes larger than the rate of growth is not specified.\n\n### Space complexity:\n[O((n)^2)](\nThe space complexity of an algorithm is the maximum amount of space (memory in most cases) used while running the algorithm's main/working code. The space complexity analysis of a problem, or algorithm is almost always expressed by the big \u0398 notation in which the function f(n) is the space complexity function.\n\n\n\n<h3>Day 3: Minimum Subarray Sum</h3>\n\n#### Inst", "answer": "C: pleasing"}

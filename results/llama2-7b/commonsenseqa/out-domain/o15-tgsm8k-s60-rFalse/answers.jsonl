Detective Raven believes that the bus will likely take 4 times as long as the car, at which time she will have a cookie.  Which of the car's wipers should stop first?\n\n### Answer A: Bus\n#### Step 1\nRather than solving both the Car and Bus's number of wipers and finding the difference, it is easier to solve how many raindrops and raingods each car and bus have, then subtract out how many raindropped and raingods are cleared per minute.\nThis will allow us to find the average number of raindropped and number of raingods cleared each minute (let's call this number 'x' to show that it is an average of the number of raindrop and raingods cleared).\nWe can also solve for x, so that we will have an equation to solve for Dwayne\n\n####Step2\nFirst, solve for x by calculating how many drops and gods can clear each wip", "answer": "D: learn"}

{"text": "The correct answer is B: traders work on the floor of a stock exchange building\n\n### Output:\n\nYour answer: traders work on a stock exchange floor in a building.\n\n### Why it is Wrong:\n\nThe following statement is wrong because a building is the location where trading is done on the floor of the marketplace where traders do the buying and selling of stock.\n\n### What is a floor in Stock Market?\n\nOn the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a trading floor in New York City where trading is done. Other U.S. stock markets where trading occurs on a trading floor are included but not limited to the New York Stock Exchange. The trading on floor is conducted by members of the exchange. Members who are registered, and eligible, place orders for large blocks of stock which is typically a huge number at a time.\n\nThe NYSE has a 100-year-old open outcry trading facility where trading is done by floor traders, as well as members of other exchanges and brokerage firms, using a system of floor brokers, clerks, and specialists who are traders. The floor traders and clerks work in the trading rooms on the floor while the specialists work off the floor at one of the trading posts near the floor. NYSE rules prohibit these trading posts from having trading computers.\n\n### Who are the Traders in the Stock Market?\n\nTrading on the NYSE floor has changed a lot over time. On the NYSE floor, trading was conducted by members who were brokers, dealers, and other traders. The NYSE now has over 2,000 members. Most of these members are securities firms (also referred to as broker-dealers), investment banks, and bank holding companies. Most of these members do not do any trading on the floor themselves. Instead, they utilize the specialist. Specialists are NYSE employees who are licensed to work on the floor who match both sides of a trade. There are over 500 of these specialists.\n\nThe specialists work as agents of the members who place orders on the NYSE via telephone to make trades.", "answer": "D: exchange"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Instructions\nA test and quiz are often used interchangeably. However, it is important to note that there several important distinctions between the two; a test and quiz are not the same. Tests are administered and used to evaluate students\u2019 mastery of the tested material. Therefore, the term test does not imply a certain frequency of examinations.  On the other hand, quizzes are short tests that are typically administered as often as it is needed for the learning process.\n\nA test is a formal evaluation of a person's knowledge and skills that is administered and graded at the end of a specific learning process or experience. Tests are not typically used to evaluate progress of students along a time line. For example, a single math test cannot assess a student\u2019s progress throughout an entire 9 months. However, it is meant to administer students who are enrolled in any formal education. Tests are given with specific goals in mind and are also referred to as an evaluation.\n\nThe format of tests vary depending on the level of instruction. Most often, standardized tests include items such as matching, multiple choice, true/false, and even short answer. In addition, tests are administered either written or orally. However, written tests that are generally administered on paper or electronic media are given more attention and given more emphasis because they can be quickly graded at a relatively low cost.\n\nMany tests are developed by a testing company, such as the College Board or ACT. Others are developed by colleges or departments, such as a department of psychology or physics. No matter who writes it, it is still considered a test.\n\nThe process of test development, development and administration is not just for teachers. The entire design of the tests and the administration are handled by a team of teachers who work in a close proximity to one another. The team is responsible for ensuring that both the questions and answers are aligned with each other. In addition, each individual question should reflect the overall goals of the assessment program.\n\nIn today's world, most test administrators use the Internet to distribute tests throughout the world.  However, with the increasing demand and acceptance of e-learning, many teachers have started creating their own electronic tests. This allows the tests to be administered in any location, regardless of time, which has made", "answer": "C: listen carefully"}

{"text": "The judge sentenced the man to death.\n\n### Input\n\n>A bird walks into a bank and says \"can I have a loan to pay for the food I want to buy for the winter\". The bank employee says no because the bird is a bird. \"Do you think anyone will give me a loan?\" the bird asks. The bank employee says \"I don't know\" and walks away.

The discount off of selling price, or the actual selling price offered by Apple?\n\nAnswer: Selling price\n\n### Input - Hard\n\nIf the Apple App store offers the game at half price, the game costs 4.95. What does the Google Play store offer the game for in the best price?\n\n### Answer: 3.50\n\n### Instructor Comments:\n\nThe Apple app store discounts prices and sells at 80% of the regular price. Since the 80% is less than 1 the cost is the same as the regular price. The 80% is a discount because it is less than 1. So, the answer is: selling price.\n#### The Apple App Store sells game for 80 percent off the selling price. So, 2 is 80 percent of the selling price and is a discount. However, 80% is not 10 or greater than 10. It is smaller than 10. For example, if a price is $10, then 80% of $10 is $8 (which is a discount because 80 is less than 100%).\n\n### Instrument Response:\n\n## Demonstraion: Choose Answer A.\n\n## Demostrateation: Choose Option A.\n\n## Input: In school, I have 10 friends.

You then need to convert in-between/between to the mathematical operation in-between/between so you can solve for each part of the fraction. A is the answer to the equation once converted back into words and D is not because it is just a bunch of numbers with no mathematical operation. E is the only answer that could reasonably be used to complete the statement.\n\nYou also need to know that the question can be broken down into smaller problems. You have four digits from Mark's question. Each individual digit has a potential value in between 0 to 9. So, there are 10 possible numbers Mark could give in his question. Once you convert those numbers to mathematical operations, you can solve for the two missing numbers you need to make Mark's question.\n\nYou also have to assume your operations are valid.

Then write the appropriate response.\n\n## How did I start it \n\nI am a beginner in coding. I never got to learn how to write a instruction or answer a question. \n\nIt was a hard thing to do and so I was thinking of ways to simplify the task. I thought if I am just a simple person, a kind of person whose English is terrible and whose mathematics are not good. So to make it easier, I would start a program that would do all the maths for me and give some kind of hints to me what type of math would be appropriate. \n\nSoon I came across about coding and this program, I didn't know what to call it but it would be a kind of program that would calculate the answer for me, or perhaps make it easier for me to do the maths needed for this programming. But more than that, it can be used in the future for a wide variety of tasks. For example, the instruction is a kind of instruction that can be used for solving a long range of things. \n\nTo do that, this program would have to be able to understand the question, or the language in the question. So for that I would require a neural net or any kind of algorithm that can be used for that. With that done, my program will be able to figure out the maths or the logic required to answer the", "answer": "A: zoo"}

She works for 1 dollar an hour less than twice her hourly wage. How many hours did she work to earn 20 dollars? Choices: A: 4 B: more than 4 C: less than 4 D: a lot more than 4\n\n### Response\nElva worked for more than 4 hours to earn 25 dollars. The reason the choice D is not correct is the amount she worked is not stated, so the choice D could be either more or less than 4 hours.\n\n### Instrution\nJim is 4 shirts short of twice as many shirts as he has. How many shirts does he have in all? Choices: A : 12 B : 24 C : 32 D : 48\n\n### Response \nJim has 48 shirts.\n\n### Why? \nJim is 2 shirts short of 1 shirts less than twice as many shirting as he has. So the sum of all Shirts is twice shirt as he has.\n\n### What if we changed the choice D? Choices: A& B& C& D\n\n### Response (what happens)\nThe answer did not change when we changed the choice to D. The choice B would change to A. The choice C would change to B. The choice D would change to C.\n\nThe reason the choice D change is because if we multiply 2 times the negative numbers which were written in the original choice, the number would be the same as the original answer because we will get a value of 4.\n\nI think the reason why this question is written like this is for you to learn how to solve questions and to write your solution in a way that can be used for multiple input choices.\n\n### Note: Remember when you have to write something more than once and its value is changed.

{"text": "A\n\n### Why?\n\nWhen you think about \"people in the same family\", most of us can likely think of several things and \"brown hair\" and \"names\" were among my top three choices.\nThe question in the \"instruction\" did not mention hair colors or names, so the choices in the answer choices seem appropriate to me.\n\n### Input:- You are a student of a private school. For your math class, the teacher has 30 students. Your class has 60 students. What is the average number of students between the two classes?\n\n### Response:- I really didn't understand the question. If the question meant, what is the average number of _students_ in your class (not just _numbers_ from 1-100), then I think \"32\" should be the answer, as each class has 32 students. I could be wrong, but the answer was _much_ larger than I expected.-\n\n### Why might this student's response be wrong? Choices:  none\n\n### Response:(The answer to this is very technical and hard to understand, but essentially, it's because _all of_ the students in my school are included in the \"total number\" of students, and so when I divide \"total number of students\" by \"number of students in class\", I am dividing by a _large_ number (all of the students), not just the ones in my class.\n\n### Why were these choices the best answers? Choices: \n\n### Response:# I would have chosen the answer with the phrase \" _less_ students\" because \" _fewer_ _people_\" seems more like a _personal_ preference. In the same way, if I was the person the question was asking about, and I did not have 37 kids, I would have chosen \" _more_ kids\" because I would not have more than 37 kids. In other words, \" _less_ students _of_ our own, the more similar we are_\" seems like a more appropriate answer, but I chose answer 3 because it had \" _people_.\"\n\n### Why was this answer selected as an error-free solution?

So, it's 8 balls. \n\n2. Increase the number by 6, 1 for each ball on the floor + 2 balls each from the 5 boulders. \n\n- Again, the boulder is dropped with 2 balls from each, so the output is 5x2 balls = 10. \n\n- Add 2 balls of each 5boulders.  It's another 10 balls added, which gives the output 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n- Set the number to 7\n\n### Summary\n\n- The program runs until 1, each boulder was dropped.\n\n- For every minute, 1 boulder is dropped and 2 balls dropped from 2 boulders.\n\n- Every 15 minutes, 9 balls are dropped at most.\n\n- The average 30 balls is produced every 15 minutes is achieved.", "answer": "B: woods"}

The family has a total of 420 dollars in its budget.  The question is:  How much does each person owe?\n\n### First Response:\n\nFirst divide the total bill by 3 to get the cost per person: $40.\n\nSecond, use the discount rate.\n\n(The discount rate is 90% or 1 - 0.9)\n\nThird, multiply the cost by (100% - 0.9%) to get the adjusted cost: 40 * (1 - 0.10) = 36\n\nFourth, multiply the adjusted cost per person by 3 to get each person's cost: 36 * 3 = 108\n\nFifth: Subtract $40 from $108 to get their bills: $108 - $40 = $68.\n\n### Second Response:\n\nTo start, the entire family budget of $420 equals 100% of the total bill\n\nWe can find a percentage of the total bill by dividing the 100 by 0. Because there is no remainder, we know that 100% must be 420\n\nThe total bill is 100%\n\nTherefore, each person's portion of the bill is calculated to 100/4.

When you go fishing at a lake on an island, you can bring 1 rod and 6 fishing poles, provided that the rods are 2 of your poles. How many rods and poles can you take with you?\n\n### Response\n\nThere are a total of 5 rods and 12 fishing poles you can take with you when you go fishing.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe total number of rods and poles equals the total number of fishing poles. If you have a rod and a pole, then 1 rod is equivalent to 2 poles. And a rod is equivalent to 1 fishing pole. Then it can be said that each pole becomes 1/2 of a rod, so that there are a total of 6 and a half poles from every rod. If there is a rod but there is no pole, then the rod becomes 1.5 fishing poles.\n\n### Example Input: 1 rod and 14 fishing poles\n\n5\n\n### Answer:\n\nThere are 5 rods and a total of 12 poles.", "answer": "A: special"}

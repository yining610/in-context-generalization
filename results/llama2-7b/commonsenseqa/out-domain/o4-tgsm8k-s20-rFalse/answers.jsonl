However, before we start playing, you should write a program to determine whether the game board is a \"draw board\" or a \"win board\". If we can determine whether or not the game will result in a win or a draw, then we can decide not to waste time playing a drawn game.\nIn this exercise, you will learn about \"while\" loop and \"switch\" case in C++\n\n\nYou could draw a game board like this:\n\n<img src=\"Gif/Pic1.gif\" width='200' height='200'>\n\nLet's use the while loop to program a player to make a game board. The gameboard has 8 * 8 squares.\n\nWrite the while statement and a for loop to generate an output like that:\n```\n *******\n ******\n ******\n   *\n ******\n*******\n*******\n\n *******\n **    *\n **    *\n    **\n*******\n******\n\n ******* \n    *\n    *\n    **   \n******\n****\n\n ******** \n    **\n ******\n    *\n***\n*******\n*****\n\n ********      \n      *\n    **  *\n*******\n~~~~~~\n```\nThen write another cpp file as below:\nWrite the while statement, a for loop, and an if statement to determine if the game board is a win board, like so:<br>\n**Hint: The \"if\" statement could be used either at the top of the main function to tell the program it is time to say a game starts. Whenever the program has started the game, the while statement could start.**<br><br>\nLet's use draw1.cpp as input file or reference this cpp file:\n\n\nThe game board is a `win board`?  Write  code in  draw1.cpp,  and run it.  You can get the following output:\n```\n ****\n ****\n *****\n*****\n ***\n*****\n*****\n\"\"\"\n```\nTo play this game, read the instruction in draw", "answer": "C: inspiration"}

So he has 2 15 hours of his work, which is equal to 8 hours so my answer is 8\n\nFor:\n\"My house is very dry\"\n\nI looked at the question first, and I saw that the answer must be the E, because there was no other question which has a skating rink! The rest of the choices can be burned to the ground, or froze and so on, but a question like this needs to be solved with a different approach. So I decided to make my skating rink! But I did not like the way I did it lol I used the ice cube maker and I put a lot of water in it (like 500 liters of water). That's the kind of stupidity I get sometimes while solving a problem.

{"text": "C\n\n---\n[[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/interview-questions-and-answers-for-interviews-and-other-practice-tests/details/957598)\n\nWe are going to introduce a simple, common, and useful method of calculating the median in Python in this article. The most common methods for computing the median are:\n- Median filter: Sort and select the value that is in the middle\n- Median of ordered sets: Omit a value (or values) and select the value that separates in two groups half\n- Median of grouped sets: Omit a portion and find the median of a subtraction\n- Median of unequal groups: If a group has unequal values, we can simply add the median values of all the subgroups.\n- Median of even groups: If the number of values in a group is even, just add half of the value of both groups\n\nFor the most part, the median is the value that is not larger than any other value, but the median that is larger and the median value are very close to each other, so if you have to get the value that falls exactly in the middle, you should use the median filter. By the way, the median is easier to use than the mean and is more suitable for computing averages than the mean. For example, if you have to measure the average cost of a car, just use the median cost of the cars you are going to buy. You will have to consider many parameters before you reach the conclusion, but not only the car you are going to buy but also the price in general.\n\nThe main advantage of the median is to be able to calculate medians of each row of data, but if you have a large number of data in the database and your computer is slow, you may want to first reduce the number of data to be processed.\n\nIf you have a data frame df that is like the one below, you can use the.median() or.median(axis=0) methods to calculate the median in Python. To help you get started, we'll first explain how to calculate the median of a single column.\n\n```python\n>>df = pd.DataFrame({'col1':[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],'col2':", "answer": "E: mail box"}

Implement the operation: (f 1)\n    2. Implement the operation : (f (f 5))\n    3. Implement the operation 10 ( (f (((f 1))) )))\n \n\nIn the first 4 chapters of the Introduction to Functional Programming book  by John Hughes (http://haskellbook.com), the concept of a data type is introduced. Your task is to write data types for integers, floats, strings and sets. (Hint: for floats use a type synonym to define \na new data type.)\n\n# **FUNCTIONS**\n\nA function takes input (or arguments) and returns output (or is a value). We write functions inside curly braces, and the arguments between the parenthesis. \n\n\n1. A function length that takes an input (a list) and returns the length of the list.\n    1. Examples: length [[]] length of empty list\n    2. Use an if statement to check if length of a given list is empty, and return 0 if list is empty, and +1 for some value otherwise.\n    3. Examples: print length of [[]] -> 0 print length of [True] -> 2\n2. A function concat which takes two or more lists and combines them into a list.\n    1) Inputs: (list1, list2,...)\n    2) return: List of length (Number of values in resultant list) which is the result of List1 followed by List2 followed...\n    \n    \n# **TOTE BOARD**\n\nOur first project will be to construct a tote board in Java.

Today we are going to have more fun playing on this. However, before we start playing, you should write a program to determine whether the game board is a "draw board" or a "win board".

Whenever the program has started the game, the while statement could start.**<br><br><n>Let's use draw1.cpp as input file or reference this cpp file:<n><n><n>The game board is a `win board`?  Write  code in  draw1.cpp,  and run it.  You can get the following output:<n>```<n> ****<n> ****<n> *****<n>*****<n> ***<n>*****<n>*****<n>"""<n>```<n>To play this game, read the instruction in draw

What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n>Output:		E<n>Your Score: TAPANG AHMAD 0; 0(<n><n>![](/public/assets/images/Tapang Ahmad.png)<n><n>Answered!<n><img src="https://github.com/Biswa-Bhatta/Code-Reviews/blob/main/images/Pictures/tapanga.png" width=50% height=50%/><n><n><n>How did I solve the problem?<n><n>I used a simple method, first if I were to solve the problem, I would make a graphical model, to determine the corey has 66 candies after we take out tapanga's 8, so it is 58 then subtract tapanga's 7, 51 then now subtract tapanga's last candies which is 6. So the answer is 51 (correct)<n><n>For: "Freddy is calling his family"<n><n>I can't really explain it without drawing a little image, but by taking 45(dad's) from 50, Freddy has only paid 5 cents for Local call. For his international call he paid 25 cents for 31 minutes of international call so on total he paid 25+(5) 30 dollars.<n><n>For:<n><n>I took it like this, he has 8 hours of his work, and from the work he has 58% of his work left. So he has 2 15 hours of his work, which is equal to 8 hours so my answer is 8<n><n>For:<n>"My house is very dry"<n><n>I looked at the question first, and I saw that the answer must be the E, because there was no other question which has a skating rink! The rest of the choices can be burned to the ground, or froze and so on, but a question like this needs to be solved with a different approach. So I decided to make my skating rink! But I did not like the way I did it lol I used the ice cube maker and I put a lot of water in it (like 500 liters of water). That's the kind of stupidity I get sometimes while solving a problem. The final answer is E!<n>

First we need to create the range i, which will make the values upto 10 be printed <n>2. If, if the i will be equal to 5 or 4, we can continue to print numbers but we will not end the loop<n>3. Next the condition `if i==5 or i ==4` will work, when i is equal to 5 we will skip to the next element and when i is equal to four we will also skip to the next element<n>4. When i is equal to 4 it will make continue to the print values to 4<n>5. Finally `print(f"{i+1}: ",end=" ") ` which will make the numbers which gets printed by the i be printed.<n>6. Next,  The  else part, when i is not equal to 4 or 5, will make the loop print values from 1 to 10<n>7. Finally, `print("The last number I printed",` after the i value prints, and makes the print statement<n>```<n>The last number I printed  is 6<n>```<n>---<n><n><n><n># Instructions:Answer the multiple choice question.<n>  <n>### Input: Dina has two cassette tapes.

How many books were not sold?<n>Output: 600<n><n>Input:One might find theirs open, with the letters that had been delivered stolen. Choices:  A: front door B: newspaper C: post office D: package E: mail box<n>Output:		C<n><n>---<n>[[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/interview-questions-and-answers-for-interviews-and-other-practice-tests/details/957598)<n><n>We are going to introduce a simple, common, and useful method of calculating the median in Python in this article. The most common methods for computing the median are:<n>- Median filter: Sort and select the value that is in the middle<n>- Median of ordered sets: Omit a value (or values) and select the value that separates in two groups half<n>- Median of grouped sets: Omit a portion and find the median of a subtraction<n>- Median of unequal groups: If a group has unequal values, we can simply add the median values of all the subgroups.<n>- Median of even groups: If the number of values in a group is even, just add half of the value of both groups<n><n>For the most part, the median is the value that is not larger than any other value, but the median that is larger and the median value are very close to each other, so if you have to get the value that falls exactly in the middle, you should use the median filter. By the way, the median is easier to use than the mean and is more suitable for computing averages than the mean. For example, if you have to measure the average cost of a car, just use the median cost of the cars you are going to buy. You will have to consider many parameters before you reach the conclusion, but not only the car you are going to buy but also the price in general.<n><n>The main advantage of the median is to be able to calculate medians of each row of data, but if you have a large number of data in the database and your computer is slow, you may want to first reduce the number of data to be processed.<n><n>If you have a data frame df that is like the one below, you can use the.median() or.median(axis=0) methods to calculate the median in Python. To help you get started, we'll first explain how to calculate the median of a single column.<n><n>```python<n>>>df = pd.DataFrame({'col1':[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],'col2':

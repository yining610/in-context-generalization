The question asks how many stickers can she put on the 5 other pages * 4 more stickers. As we saw in the example, she can put 68 stickers on the other 5 pages * 4 more = <<68*4=272>>272\nSo the question asks how many sticklers she must subtract from 272 to get to 112.\n\nSo\n\n112 - 272 = <<112-272=150>>150\n\nSo how many stickers does she have left?\n\n272-150 = <<272-132=140>>140\n\nWhat does that mean?

She is going to make a pair of socks with 5 or fewer colors (in a pair), but no 2 colors are exactly the same in a 5-color pair. If she is to make at least one pair, how many pairs is she likely to make?\n-We subtract the purple socks from her sock count because purple and red socks cant be in the same pair.\n-We subtract the orange socks because orange and red socks cant go in the same pair. So our new count is 7+9=<<7+9=16>>16\n\n-We know the pair needs to have 5 or less colors, so our sock count minus 16 is going to be equal or less than 15 in total. Let this value be s so our equation becomes 16-s\n\n-We now have the following equation:\n\nSo 16-s needs to be divisible by 2 and 3\n\n16 is a multiple of 2 and 2 is a multiple of every number including 3, so 16-s must be a multiple of 3\n\n15(16-s)/2^2 = 30 divided by 2^2 = (95)/4 = 23.75 \n\nSo if s represents s - 23.70(s + s), then s = 23.5\n\nWe can solve this more quickly by rewriting the equation s/2 = 23.\n\nSo s = 11 which means she has 16-11 = 5 pairs\n\n#### 5\nAnswer: 5\n\n###", "answer": "C: plain"}

No.\nIf Mary has an extra tooth, it would be her 10th tooth (in humans) but pugs don't have 10 which means it would be Mary's 11th tooth but we already know her number of teeth is less then 12, so it wouldn't be her 11th.\nLast possibility pugs don't havd 12 but humans don't have 24.  This means it's 23, so 23-12=<<23-12/23>>23-12 = 11 and since we know Mary's got a big mouth, Mary had 12 teeth and she is a human, her number of teeth is11.\n\n#### 11\n#### False\nInput (Optional)\n\nInput:The children were excited about attending a birthday party.\nRationalesWe know this because they mentioned the birthday party in the story and then stated they were excited so we know they like birthday parties.\nWe know that children are excited to attend birthday parties since in most cases they are young and don't know the difference between a birthday party and any other party.\n\n#### True\n\n(Optional)\nRationalesMall is a synonym of shopping center.", "answer": "C: baseball stadium"}

But you can use the rationale that if A is not true then the children will play games, sports, chess or play ball. So the task will not be a ball.\n### Answer:A:throw things\n\n### Input The child is learning how to throw properly.  She should start by catching. Choices:  A. throw it B. catch it C. roll it D. shoot the ball E. bounce it.\n\n### Response A: Catch it\n\n### Rationale:\nI thought the child will catch up because catching up will always come first. What is the first thing a player that is learning any new sport or activity will always do?  They will learn how to catch up the ball. You can find the evidence from this video https://tinyurl.com/w7x4fzq\n### Answer: A: catch it\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nThe children are playing in several games in different areas on a playground.  In the first game, they will be throwing balls, and then they will be playing basketball, hockey, and soccer.  In the second game, they will be playing the same four sports to earn the most points.  What is the first step the child should do to help that child do well?\nChoices:  A. roll the balls B. catch the balls C. shoot the balls D. bounce the balls E. dribble the balls\n\nAnswer: C\n\nRationale: First, you roll balls to make them a little smaller. You\u2019re trying to get the balls closer, right?\n\n### Question - The children will be throwing balls, then they will play basketball, hockey and soccer. In the second game they will play the same four sports to win the most points. What is the first step a child should take to make the child do very well?\n\n### Choices: A. roll the balls, B. catch the balls, C", "answer": "B: play sports"}

In this scenario you are not doing any work that can give your muscles energy to start with so nothing is mainly used in your muscles.  In the same line of thought, if you do not exhale then you start to accumulate more toxins in your body, which is not a good thing.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nB) Thinking does not mainly use your muscles because it doesn't mainly use your muscle\nC) Shouting does not mainly use your body's energy because it does not mainly use your bodys energy\nD) Work off does not mainly use your energy because it does not really use your bodys energy mainly because working off energy would require you to build more energy to move, but you have already expended your energy during that movement since its now working off energy.\n\n### E) Exercising will mainly use your energy because you must exert your energy to move in exercising.

These animals know when they need to leave, and they move the entire herd without the help of humans, and without any other animals or people to tell them where to go. If people are asked to estimate how many buffalo are in a herd, it is difficult for us to answer that question with any scientific accuracy. The question is about how many buffalo are typically in a herd. If researchers are able to get photos of each and every buffalo in a herd, they estimate that there are 10,000 buffalo in each herd.

{"text": "B\n\n### Demostration: \nB) can't be fleshy? if by can you meant is \"flesh\" that can only be a trivia game because humans are flesh\n\n### Answer: B\n\n## Problem: \n\n**Input:**Mary and Jake each have the same amount of money, $21.00. Mary saves her money and plans to buy a new suit. Jake will also buy a new suit but he spends each dollar he earns.  Jake will earn $4.33 per week.  Mary intends to save an extra $2.00 and work on her car for the next month.  At the end of the month Mary will have what percentage more money?\n**Rationales:**Jake will earn $16.04 in a month which is $4.33 * 4 weeks = <<4.33*4=16.92>>16.92 but because Mary saves an extra $2 he needs to make up how much she spends over the next month so to make it balanced out at the end of the month Jake needs to earn $13.55. Jake earns <<4.33+13.55=17.88>>17.88 he does not earn as much as Mary since he will spend the extra $7.04 he does.\nSo the percentage that Mary will have saved is ((17.88*100/21.00)-100) because Jake only earns $13.88 and Mary earns an extra $2.  So our answer would be 17.88%-100 which is <-17.88/21.08-100> <-17.83/21.09-> <-10/11-100>. We can see that 10-100 = -100 so because we multiplied 10*(-10/11) which is -100/-11=.888 so our answer is 83%\n#### 100.83\nAnswer: 83 percent", "answer": "C: human"}

How many stickers did she buy originally, after the mall trip?\n\n### Answer:  14\n\n### Rationales:  She bought a sweater and used half the money to buy it.\n\nWhen she did that, she had 2 stickers for sweater.  Since the clothing items are shown 2 sticker for each clothing item.\n\nThe first two clothing items she bought were a t-shirt and shorts.\n\nEach item had 2 sticker each.  So, they had 4 and 2 stickers each.\n\n### The next item she bought was a t-shirt, so it did not receive a sticker because she already had 2 stickers.\n\nNext t-shirt is not receiving a sticker, but the other two clothing items receive it because they did not receive after the mall trip.\n\nThe four sticker she had plus the two stickers equals 6 stickers.\n\n### That means she used half of the stickers to buy her sweater.  So, before she used half of the money to buy the sweater, she had [6/2] stickers to buy.\n\n### Let's say she had 6 stickers in the bank.

{"text": "####\nAnswer:\n\n### Discussion:\nWhen two devices want to share information, data, files, or content, they need some way to pass that data from the first device to the second.\n\nThe computers and other devices in your home, office, or school are connected through electrical cables.  These cables are called wires.\n\nYou can't directly plug one computer or device into another.  You need to plug them all in to a bigger device that connects everything together.\n\nThis bigger device has ports where your computer, laptops, phone, or other devices can connect.  It is called a Computer Network.\n\nSometimes the network device is built into the bigger device, like if your cable or phone provider installs the device on their network.  They give you permission to connect your devices to their network in exchange for charging you for the time you have their network.\n\nIf you are at the library, you can use the library's Wi-Fi network, or an open wireless network, instead of using an Ethernet cable to connect your computer or other devices.\n\nThe same principles apply to connecting your devices to phone networks, and 3G, 4G, and 5G networks as well.\n\nIf you've ever been on an aeroplane, you have used a network called a Cell, or Radio Network.  This is the same technology used in most modern phone networks.\n\nNow that we've all become even more reliant on our computers, we can take advantage of Cloud Computing.\n\nMany of these networks use cables or fibre optic communication systems that are very fast but expensive.  So, many of these systems use wi-fi instead on 802.11 or Bluetooth.\n\nIn these networks data is transmitted between devices on either cables or wirelessly.\n\nBut wireless communication devices are more vulnerable to being hacked.\n\n### Input:\"What is the best way to test if you have a good network connection?\" Choices:  A\" Check if you can open web pages \" B\" Try and download a file \" C\" Check if you can make a Skype call \" D\" Check the speed of your connection \" E\" Verify your network type in the internet router console\n\n### Response:\"A\", B, and D have been selected\n\n##", "answer": "D: computer network"}

Why was it wrong?\n\nIt doesn't make sense logically that lions (large animals) would be the only organisms inhabiting the ocean.\n\n-If lions are in the oceans then they'll have to travel the oceans to find large, healthy prey or they will starve to death.\n-Knowing their natural behavior they will only be found traveling the length of the oceans. (to find prey)   \nIt is much more likely that they will be found on an African grassland in warm weather.\n-In cold weather, they will want to live next to a source of heat (lava) in Africa to avoid starvation.\n-A lion in the ocean is not realistically plausible.\n\n#### What would you do differently?\n\nIf I were to choose differently, I would want to choose a more realistically plausable environment.

The box is too small, the lap is too confined.\nThe barn actually gives the environment for them to hunt their prey. The barn gives them more room to run around and feel free.

The doctor tells her she has to drink half a cup of milk for each injured part of her body. She has 4 arms and 2 legs.  She already has 6 bandaged toes.  Give the number of bandaged limbs she has left to drink milk.\n\n### Rationales: A banana has a single finger.  Rainbow Dash has 2. She has another 4 and 2, so a total of 6.  She has 6 bandaged legs and 0 bandaged arms.  She needs 8 cups of milk.  She needs to do that 35 times.  In order to be safe, she cannot drink more than 30 cups. If she takes in 28 cups, she hasn't drank one cup of milk more than that, which satisfies her needs.  If she drank exactly 28 cups of milk, she has 15 limbs left that aren't bandaged at all and she will live to see another day (if she drinks at least that much milk, she will have enough milk, it's just that her limbs are so badly hurt that she's got no more room).

What is a likely range for this temperature?\n\n### Demostration:\nTo find the right answer on this multiple choice question, we must find out how much the temperature can range.We know that the average temperature in the north Pole region is 15 degrees. We also know that there are 75000 square miles in antartica. (1)The temperature will not vary by more than <60*sqrt(num)  (2)Since the whole number square root of 7500 is 26.2, the temperature will not vary more than 26.2*(15-0) = 403.2 degreesF (3)262*15 = 3962. Since we need the temperature to remain between 100 and 990 degrees F, 262*160 = 4170 and this is a greater number than the 3962 that we found earlier, we say the temperature will vary from 0 to 790 degrees F. \n\n#### 990\nAnswer: 990\n\n###", "answer": "A: tree tops"}

When we say an object has flat bases, we mean the lower face of the object is flat. The sides are parallel, which means they are running in the same direction.  Prisms with flat bases are called solid prisms.  Prisms are made of a plane and a solid material.  The base of a prism is also called a face.  We can also take the top part of a prism, which is the top face, and call it the vertex of the prism. The vertex is the point where three faces meet at the top of a prism.\n\n### A prism is a geometric solid in three dimensions, having flat sides, each of which is an identical plane figure.\n\n### What is a prism?

Write a response that accurately completes the task.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n* **The below code is just the syntax for the code, not the finished code.  This is how you would begin a nested 4 loop statement.  First you'll do your outermost loop, the outer loop will check to see which line of the 4 is not equal to the target.  Once you have that index number, you'll do the inner loop and that's how you'll get to your nested for statement that you're already familiar with.**  Once you do that, you do your inner for loop by declaring x=0 and your i=x to 3 to make sure you include all 4 lines of code that you're looping through.  Once you have each of the loops and the if statement that checks to make sure the index number is not equal to the 0, you have all your code.  Once you've completed that, you run your code and once you've run through it, it should create the same results as the example in the image below since you've nested your loops correctly.  Each index number should match the lines of the code that had the same number. It should start with:\n\n```\n outer loop (0-3): loop 0 times\n   inner loop (0-3)\n     x=0\n     i=0\n     for x=0 to 3\n   inner loop (3):\n     for i=0 to 3+2-1:  print your nested loop statements.\n```\n\n#### 1\n\n### Input\n\nInput:  4 outer:\ninner:  3 inner:\n\nOutput:  0, 1, 6, 5\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe 4 outer loop will count from 0 to 3 as you see in the image and will print 0, 1,  2 and 3\nThe 3 inner loop will count from 4,5 and 6 with the two variables x=4 and i=0 to 2 which is why you see the output is that it is printing 1, 2 and 3 in order since i=0 prints 1 when i=1 it prints 2 which is following the first value", "answer": "A: zoo"}

You can't even find air that people have breathed on other planets. Choice B is incorrect because of the same reason. Choices A and E are incorrect because spaceships and public transit are both examples of things that were built by or for human beings and humans do not breathe in \"charm\" or oxygen atoms.

He wants to use one quarter of the water in the tank each week. How many days will it take to empty the tank completely\n\n### Direction:\nYour response to the problem needs to be a complete sentence that tells what you are doing with this problem.\n### Rationale\nMaking this problem math doesn't help because you can just use the answer calculator. It is more important that you fully understand the problem and the answer and have a rational way to reason out the right answer.\n\n### Response\nI would do this problem by first finding how many weeks until the tank is empty, then i would just find out how many weeks it is from where i am now.  I came up with this solution by first figuring out that it took me 6 weeks to fill the tank, so after 2 gallons per week x 6 weeks, it would take me 24 total gallons to finish filling.  Then if in 2/3 of the tank it is 12 inches deep, so i did 12 * 4 = 3 gallons per inch.  So it takes me 24 + 3 * 6 weeks - 24= -2 gallons left.\n\n### Rationales\nThe correct procedure to solve this problem is to calculate the number of weeks, then calculate what you have remaining in the tank.

He's been going to this bar every day now for a a few months and every time that he goes in, he orders the same thing.  Now every one in town knows that this bar has this very expensive drink.

There is no way to abbreviate the whole date (31-05-2013), so we only use the abbreviation for the first letter of the month.  But a date can be written in 4 different ways.  You can write it the month first (Mar 25th), The day first (25 Mar), the year first (2013 March 25th), or in the order we are more used to (25 March 2013).

If you had all the ingredients on hand, what would be the cheapest way to make a large pepperoni and cheese pizza?\nRationales You know that 1.5 is the answer, because it is stated that 1.5 or $4.00 for a large pizza.\nThe $10 total is a total for both 1.5 and the $4.00 pizza. So you can subtract the $4.01 from $10 total to get $5.99, because $4.01-$4.00=<<$4.01-$5.99==$0.00>>0.00 then you add the $0.07 from pepperini and the $0.00+$0.07+$0.20+$1.65 = <<$0.00+$1.67=$1.67>>1.67. \nWe can subtract $2.20 from 1.67 to get $1.59 which is the final amount for a large pepperoni cheese pizza.

How can you make sure that the only the last person left has drawn their number twice?\n\n### Demostration:\n\n### Input/Inputs:\nFirst you draw a card, then you ask the person that has not drawn a card yet to draw a card.\n\n### Response/Solution:\n\nSo how could he pick one person? He could take the turn\n\n### Rationales:\nIf you had to ask three or four friends before it would not be fair, because one person would probably lose.  And the first turn doesn't really matter, as long as you can do the three or four steps after without messing up.\nSo you would ask each of your friends in order if they had not drawn a card yet.  This way, you can pick any number you want as long as you have not picked it.\n\n#### 4-5\nAnswer:\n# 4-5\nThe solution is : ask each of your friends one-by-one if they have drawn their card until you can pick a card that has not been picked before.\n\n### Input :You are in a bookstore browsing.

{"text": "Choices:  open tress \u2013 B: bedroom \u2013 C: istanbul\n\n### Rationales:\nRules for choosing the correct answer: \"man didn't like getting\" means it's the man's decision, not the woman. Because \"steps\" is singular, we only see one woman which means one woman in bedroom. Because \"carpeting\" is singular, it's one floor or one place. There's one bedroom, one Istanbul, one open trestle, etc.. The man decided carpeting was important but was not concerned with having carpeting in the bathroom instead of bedroom or the kitchen instead of Istanbul.\nIn the man, since one bedroom is enough for the man, that's why the man didn't like stepping on the cold tiles. He is not the man who decided to put the carpeting, so he is the man who decided not to put carpeting in his bathroom or kitchen. There's one sentence in this sentence, carpeting was put in the bathroom but the woman didn't like it, we need to look for the bathroom we will find in \"istanbul\" and see whether it's carpeted or not.

How must he increase the number of sit ups to reach her goal?\n\n### Rationales:First you will find his goal by doing <<6*54= <<6*(54/6)=360>>360\nThen you need to find what he will do for the next exercise.  360/54 = <<360/55=6>>6 so that means that she will do 6 more sit ups as opposed to 54, she will do 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60\nThe next exercise is jumping jacks, which he will do <<7*360>>7*640 jump jack and then the final exercise is squats so he will do <<2*360>>2*640 and will end with 40+640+2640=<<40+64+2640>>6880.\nFor push up the number you got in the earlier question, you'll have to add 6*40 = <<6*(40/6)=100>>100\nTotal Push ups will be 40+100 =<<40+10=50>>50\n\n#### 6880\nAnswer: 6880", "answer": "E: die of starvation"}

{"text": "#### Option A: \n\n#### Option B: \n\n#### Answer:\n\n#### Incorrect Answers:\n\n### Input:\"When does the earth move fastest around the sun?\"\n\n### Demostration:\n\nEarth's orbit around the sun is not a perfect circle. Its circumference is a little larger than the 360 degrees of a circle. At some points of the Earth's orbit, the Earth moves faster than at other points of the orbit. For most of the time, the Earth is speeding up.\n\nHowever, at some points the Earth is speeding down. These are the times the Earth is moving the slowest. An easy way to remember this is to know that the Earth moves fastest when it is moving the furthest away from the sun or the \"Northern point\". If you want the Earth to move fast, then you will want to be at the \u201cNorther Point\u201d.\n\nAt the \"Southern Point\" the Earth must be very close to the sun. This is about 20 days before and after perihelion.\n\nPerihelion is the point in the Earth's orbit where it is closest to the sun. This point is called the \"Southern point\" because the sun is below the horizon. This is also in the December - January time period.\n\nThe Earth moves so close to the sun so quickly that it is considered to be the fastest the Earth moves around the sun.\n\nWhen the Earth moves the fastest, you will feel all the movement of the Earth's rotation. When the Earth moves slowly, you will not feel much of the movement of the Earth because it is moving so slow.\n\nTherefore, in Australia, the Earth moves the fastst during its summer because Australia is on the \"Southern\" (i.e. South) side of the earth and moves the slowest during its winter because Australia is on the norther side of the earth.\n\n#### 2\nAnswer: 2\n\n### Instructions\n\n### Input\n\nFor this task, write a response that appropriately answers the question.\n\n##Input:\"In 4 years and 3 days, Lennix will be 55 years old.

The word \"community\" is a collective group of people.  In order to have a community of people, that \"state\" would be a group of organized people.  In order for these organized people to identify themselves as a community/state, they would have numbers/letters so that they can distinguish themselves from the rest of society.

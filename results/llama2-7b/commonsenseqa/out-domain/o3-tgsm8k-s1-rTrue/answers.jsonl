It would take 100 cents to equal $1.05 (1.05*0.01 = 10.5 cents, so 100 cts = $1.05).\nTherefore, if 1.10 is the total cost of the bat and ball, that means their values must be different.\nSuppose the bat costs 2.10 and the ball costs 0.05, then it would cost 1.15 (2.1+0.05).  Since the total cost is 1.10, you can have either 1.0 bat or 1.0 ball, and if the cost is 1.05, you can get 1.0 bat and 0.5 balls, or 0.5 bat and 1.0 balls.

She ate 1/3 of the breadsticks (which we know from what she told her dad) and 2/3 of the pasta.  Her family knows how bad she is at estimating, so they asked her to estimate how much pasta and breadsticks she ate.  Her dad gave her five math problems to do and when he checked her answer, he said there were some things she got wrong.  She missed one of the problems twice.  She was asked to multiply by a fraction but she used the times sign instead of the multiplication sign.  She answered the fourth problem incorrectly.  And for the last problem, she was asked to subtract 3/4 and she didn't make the negative sign.  Did she get it right or wrong? (note the answers can be in words or numerals)\nOutput: If Liz's dad gave her problems to check her addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division skills, you can assume that all problems were in different operations as well.  Let's say that the answer is that she got her answers wrong.\nShe got 1/3 and 2/3 correct, so 2/3 is greater than 1/3.\nShe got 2/3 wrong so subtracting one from it would result to less than 1/3, which is wrong. Since 2/3 is an estimate (which Liz knows is really high), the correct answer is 0.5\nShe got 1 and 2 wrong, so the answer should be 0.6 because 1/3 is greater than both 1 and 2, and 2/3 is close to 4/6, which is less than 2/3.\nShe misinterpreted the problem by doing negative subtraction instead of addition.\nShe got the problem 0.5 wrong, and 1/2 is less than it, so the negative sign meant plus, and so she got 1/2 plus 3/4 = 4/4 or 1.

A student named Steve did half of the problems, his brother David did three-quarters, and five others completed the problems.  How many problems were to be done?\nOutput: This question does not specify which group is the five other students other than it isn't Steve and David's group. The group of people who didn't answer the question is the three-quarters group. We know that we have 13 students in the group. We know that group 1 has Steve and group 2 has, at least from what is known in the question David. So we have 2 groups, the remaining 10 students. Since they finished the \"problems,\" which we assume is a multiple choice question, we know that they each finished 25% of the questions. If we put the students in the order that they finished the problems (Steve, David, the others), and write it as a percentage, it should add up to 100%. Let's do this. The \"others\" answered 1 problem/problems=<<1/problems=1%>>1%\nand Steve answered 7.5/13=<<7.5/12=0.6/>>0.6%\nand lastly David answered 3 questions/8=<<3/8=0.375/>>0.375%. David is half of 1, so David did 3/2 or 1.5/problems. I'm pretty sure that David is the one who answered 1.5/Problems\nSo the final answer would be 0.375+0.6=<<0.375%+0.6=1%>>1%.

A person who only has one arm B. A man that has one hand. 1 Arms = 1 hand. so that rules that out. 4 hands = 2 arms, so you subtract one arm and then subtract one hand from 2 arms and you have 1 arm again. so that means a person who has 4 arms.\n\n\n### Final Task:Create a program that will generate the phrase:\n\n\"We need to come up with rules for how I spend this large amount of money.\"   \n\nThis is a sentence that is constructed from the English language words.

I have 1,000 apples.  I will be dividing these 1,001 apples among my children evenly.  Each child has more than 1 apple as is expected of a child.  Please help me assign the 1,002 apples so that the total number of apples after distribution is equal to 1,003.  (Please note after I assign these apples that my three children are 4, 5 and 7 years old respectively).\"\nOutput:Let me explain this question for you.  Imagine I have 48 people (children), age 4 to 30 and 48 apple.  No one can eat 30 apples alone even a group of people.  Hence, the simplest way is to do a quick division.  The equation is 48/4(4yrs)+5(5yrs)+7(7yrs), so i.e.  48/4+5+7= 12.  Thus 12 people between 4 to 31 gets an apple.\n\nInput:A chocolate has 11 grams and a fruit has 6 grams and a vegetable has 15 grams.  Alice has 20 chocolate, 8 fruit and 12 vegetables.What is her total healthy and unhealthy foods?\nOutput:I will divide the total grams into different categories and then subtract the two values to get the answer.  Then I can multiply by the number of grams.  So, 11 chocolate * 20 = 220 grams and 6 fruit * 8=48 grams.  Since fruit is bad, subtract 48 from 220 which = 172. Then add 12 vegetables * 15 = 180.\nFinal answer = 172 + 1", "answer": "D: orchestra"}

What\u2019s the day of the month that will be the 13th?\nOutput:12 + 1 = 13\nThere are 12 months in a year.  Since the problem is talking about the 13th of the month, it means the 12th month has to be the 13 month.\nSince we know a year has 12 months:  a day has 24 hours:  a week has seven days:  and a year has 365 days=52 weeks\nIf we take 52 and divide by 7 to get the number of weeks in a year, we get 7.5 or 3.0, but a week is not exactly seven days. It's usually six.  If we multiply 7.5 by 6 weeks we get 45 weeks.\nNow we need to convert 45 days into months.  There are 4 weeks, 7 days in 7 days: so there are 28 days per month.  45 days would be 28 * 15. (15 is half of 30 or 4.5 so we rounded up to 15)\n\nSince we know there are 12 months per year:  we subtract the months from our total.\nWe subtracted 15 from 12 to get 27 months.  So the 13th month would be the 12th of last months\nSo the final answer to the question would be January\n\nInput: Sam has two sets of 4 sticks.  He needs two sticks from one of them for a project.

You can see your code run with each input line, followed by the console output.  \n\nThen, try running your own code in the REPL.\nThe sample code has one variable, var, which has two possible values: 95.5 and 84.5. The code has 2 print statements, and your first print statement should print what you expect:\n\n\">>> var\"\n\nThe 2 variables, var and my_integer, can be the same variable, which does not matter. The 4 output fields, the variable, variable type, variable's address and the message are the same, but the field \"Var Address\" will be smaller because this is the output of an integer variable, not the variable's address, as in the last field of the sample output\n\n### Suggested Solutions\n\n> Note:  The variable's output is different for each field,\neven though the data type is the same.

Choices: A) 8 B) 16 C) 14 D) 2 E) 10.\nOutput: The question asks us to work out the total sum of girls with and not wearing gloves so we need to subtract the sum of girls with gloves from the total number of girls to get the number with/not wearing gloves.

Once all the input has been read, the program should read each line of input and execute the corresponding function as follows:\n\n```\nIf the line is \"Mary had 85 stick\" 42 is added to 89 and saved in the variable `remaining`.\n\nIf the line reads \"How many stickers does Mary  have left?\" you compute and output the remaining variable `remaining`\n\n```\n\nIf the line is `The lady was doing a on  man show of her tell-tail story` then the program `pokes` the `string` into a  new `if` so it does not have to use `else if`\nThe `if` statements inside the `if` state that the `show` must be a riddle. `String.replace` is used to remove the double quotes. The `.replaceAll` method replaces all matches. The string is divided by space to create two words. Next the two variables are created. The `if` statement tests the first word against the first word of the riddle. If they are the same, the other word is replaced by the string `yes`. If the two words do not match, the second word is replaced with yes. The variable `isanswer` is used to indicate whether or not an answer is correct. Finally, the statement `yield return \"yes\";` indicates that the main function should yield a YES.\n\n### Instructior: \n\nImplement each of the following functions\n1. main\n2. `pokes` \n3. `string.replaceAll`\n4. `string.replace`\n\n### Instuctions:\n5.

It turns out that one material takes twice as long as the other.  How long will heating the two materials take?\nOutput: If the longer one takes 2x the time as the other material, the longer one needs at least 2x as much time.\nThe shorter one takes 1/2 the time as the same material, the shorter one needs at least 1/2 the amount of time.\nIn short, the total time spent heating the materials would not change and we can only subtract the amount of time needed by the shorter one as it is longer.  So the time needed is the time needed for the longer material plus the time needed by the shorter material - the time needed by the longer material.\nGiven: ((A)2xB) - (B)/2A == x/2B\nThis can be rewritten as:\n((A)2xB)/2A - B/2 = x/2A \nor:\n((A)Bx)/(BxA) - 1/2 = B/2A\nor:  B - 2A = ((B*B)/B)/2A \nor (2B^2 - 2B)/2A = B\nThis can be simplified even further to:\n2B^2 - (4B)/2A = 4B - B = B (the RHS)\nB = (4B - B)/2 = B/2\nSo the two objects will take a total of: (2 * Time for the first object)\nOr Time for the first object would take: (1 * Time for the second object)\nSo the final answer would be: Time for the first object = Time for the second object\n\nInput:", "answer": "A: cash register"}

{"text": "A is CORRECT\n\nThis question is a bit funny because the words 'low water' will make you immediately think about adding water, just like if it had said 'high water' the answer would have been something else. To be certain, look at the choices:\n\nSurface of earth: not low water.\nHumidifier: not low water. Humidifiers increase humidity, which is more water in the atmosphere.\nSkating rink/Ice cube: not low water. Like, you don't put 'low water' in your ice cubes.\n\nSo really the only word choices that are the complete opposites of 'low water' are 'Burn it to the ground' and 'A: humidifier'. Since'surface of the earth' is not a low water answer, the only choice that is not a 'low-water' solution is 'Burn it to ground'. Now, it is not a high humidity solution as it was for a high water solution, but it is the only answer where you remove water, which is low water.\n\nInput: When a ball bounces off the ground, it bounces at the same height as it lands.\nIf a ball is dropped onto a rubber mat, it will bounce less than half the height of the floor it falls to. The mat's surface acts like an \"anti-bounce\" device, which causes the ball to bounce at a height less than half of the height it would have otherwise.\nWhy? Input: When a ball bounce off the ground, it will bounce same height as it land. If the ball is dropped on rubber mat, it bounces less than half the height, why?\nOutput: It bounces less than it would because it slows down upon hitting the rubber mat. You are correct that it would bounce as high as when it was dropped to a different height, but because it is hitting another object that slows it down on top of the normal force it experiences from gravity it loses some energy.\n\n### Explanation:(I'm an idiot) this problem could have a very simple solution like using conservation of energy, but my brain decided to give it the hard way, so I will post a simple explanation here!\n\nTo calculate how high a ball bounces when dropped, we have to use the acceleration equation:", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

Please answer all of these questions\n\n##### Question 1: Mark is planning on buying a tow truck to use as a service vehicle with his business truck.  He wants to see what the monthly cost will be for his employees  so he knows how much to get paid in order to get paid back by the end of the year.  There will be four employees during the summer and six during the fall semester who will drive the truck. He wants to know the total monthly cost and how much he needs to pay them.\nInput: Mark will have 4 employees this summer and 6 employees during this semester.\n\n4*150 =<<4*150=600>>600 miles with 6 employees this semester is 360 miles for the summer and fall combined\n\nSo in 360 miles mark will pay $1447.50/45$mile/$45 mile = <<1447.08/$45=32.1>>32.145 minutes per mile.\n\nHe should round up, leaving 1.982$.  He should multiply that times the number of miles and then multiply that times 1.98$ and that'll be the cost.  That's because each day has many hours, therefore 1.98 should mean the month is 1.98 months long.\n\nMark decided to multiply total miles driven by $1.982$ and got the correct answer: 600+360=<<600+30=940>>940 miles * 1.98 = <<1.98*940=1934>>1934 miles and 10340 cents\n\nSo, the cost to drive this truck should be  $10,34.00$ a month with his employees.\n\n##### Question two:\n\nInput: What is a fraction that is greater than 1?

Candles are made from wax and when it burns, heat released.<n>Fire is a self-sustaining chemical reaction. The combustion of the wood releases heat. This heat warms a metal plate, which melts the wax, which solidifies it again, releasing the same amount of heat so the whole cycle repeats to create fire. Fire was the first source of heat.<n><n>Lava is fluid molten rock that is created on Earth as a result of volcanic eruptions deep below ground surface. Lava is hot enough to melt rocks as it passes through them.<n><n>Solar panels use the suns rays as a heat source. This process creates enough energy on Earth to power cities.<n><n>Wood is a material that is used for making heat and cooking. Wood is one of the most essential materials to build human life and culture. Coal is a rock that consists mostly of carbon and burns as a fuel as it releases heat. Coal is a fossil fuel and a readily combustible rock that is formed by the pressure on the sediment and buried with other organic materials that have been converted to carbon.<n><n>### References: None.<n>

She is going to make a pair of socks with 5 or fewer colors (in a pair), but no 2 colors are exactly the same in a 5-color pair. If she is to make at least one pair, how many pairs is she likely to make?<n>-We subtract the purple socks from her sock count because purple and red socks cant be in the same pair.<n>-We subtract the orange socks because orange and red socks cant go in the same pair. So our new count is 7+9=<<7+9=16>>16<n><n>-We know the pair needs to have 5 or less colors, so our sock count minus 16 is going to be equal or less than 15 in total. Let this value be s so our equation becomes 16-s<n><n>-We now have the following equation:<n><n>So 16-s needs to be divisible by 2 and 3<n><n>16 is a multiple of 2 and 2 is a multiple of every number including 3, so 16-s must be a multiple of 3<n><n>15(16-s)/2^2 = 30 divided by 2^2 = (95)/4 = 23.75 <n><n>So if s represents s - 23.70(s + s), then s = 23.5<n><n>We can solve this more quickly by rewriting the equation s/2 = 23.<n><n>So s = 11 which means she has 16-11 = 5 pairs<n><n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>###

Choices:  A: throw things B: play sports C: play games D: play ball E: play chess<n><n>### Response:		A: throw things<n><n>### Rationales:<n>I thought the parents was going to give the child the chance to play ball. But the first task gives the instruction "he will give all the children three opportunities to score with a thrown ball". So I thought in the same way it wasn't going to be a ball this task is going to not be a ball either. But you can use the rationale that if A is not true then the children will play games, sports, chess or play ball. So the task will not be a ball.<n>### Answer:A:throw things<n><n>### Input The child is learning how to throw properly.  She should start by catching. Choices:  A. throw it B. catch it C. roll it D. shoot the ball E. bounce it.<n><n>### Response A: Catch it<n><n>### Rationale:<n>I thought the child will catch up because catching up will always come first. What is the first thing a player that is learning any new sport or activity will always do?  They will learn how to catch up the ball.

What is the first step the child should do to help that child do well?<n>Choices:  A. roll the balls B. catch the balls C. shoot the balls D. bounce the balls E. dribble the balls<n><n>Answer: C<n><n>Rationale: First, you roll balls to make them a little smaller. You’re trying to get the balls closer, right?<n><n>### Question - The children will be throwing balls, then they will play basketball, hockey and soccer.

Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: vent<n><n>### Rationale:<n>A) Venting is what your body does when toxins are trying to come out of your lungs. As you exhale, the toxins leave the body.  In this scenario you are not doing any work that can give your muscles energy to start with so nothing is mainly used in your muscles.  In the same line of thought, if you do not exhale then you start to accumulate more toxins in your body, which is not a good thing.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>B) Thinking does not mainly use your muscles because it doesn't mainly use your muscle<n>C) Shouting does not mainly use your body's energy because it does not mainly use your bodys energy<n>D) Work off does not mainly use your energy because it does not really use your bodys energy mainly because working off energy would require you to build more energy to move, but you have already expended your energy during that movement since its now working off energy.<n><n>### E) Exercising will mainly use your energy because you must exert your energy to move in exercising. It may help to use some of the energy generated in your body but by exerting more energy by putting your muscles through different positions, that energy is used. You body cannot build more energy through exertion if you have already used it to exert your muscles.<n><n>### Choices:<n>A: vent

These animals know when they need to leave, and they move the entire herd without the help of humans, and without any other animals or people to tell them where to go. If people are asked to estimate how many buffalo are in a herd, it is difficult for us to answer that question with any scientific accuracy. The question is about how many buffalo are typically in a herd. If researchers are able to get photos of each and every buffalo in a herd, they estimate that there are 10,000 buffalo in each herd. Researchers aren't sure why all of the buffalo

Mary saves her money and plans to buy a new suit. Jake will also buy a new suit but he spends each dollar he earns.  Jake will earn $4.33 per week.  Mary intends to save an extra $2.00 and work on her car for the next month.  At the end of the month Mary will have what percentage more money?<n>**Rationales:**Jake will earn $16.04 in a month which is $4.33 * 4 weeks = <<4.33*4=16.92>>16.92 but because Mary saves an extra $2 he needs to make up how much she spends over the next month so to make it balanced out at the end of the month Jake needs to earn $13.55. Jake earns <<4.33+13.55=17.88>>17.88 he does not earn as much as Mary since he will spend the extra $7.04 he does.<n>So the percentage that Mary will have saved is ((17.88*100/21.00)-100) because Jake only earns $13.88 and Mary earns an extra $2.  So our answer would be 17.88%-100 which is <-17.88/21.08-100> <-17.83/21.09-> <-10/11-100>. We can see that 10-100 = -100 so because we multiplied 10*(-10/11) which is -100/-11=.888 so our answer is 83%<n>#### 100.83<n>Answer: 83 percent<n>

The only information available is that it is a'secret formula', and that the coca used in the drink is coca extract (unlike regular cocaine, which is obtained from the coca leaf).

If it's a 4 inch one, then how would I measure 5?<n>- Rational: It's obvious that a 4 inch is longer than a meter because how can a meter be longer than it's self? So since a 4 inch  is shorter than a meter I need to go down the whole scale to measure 5".<n><n>### Response:"You can measure 5 on a 4 inch (10 cm) ruler by counting the number of notches on the ruler starting with the number 1 and using the numbers to the right to tell you how many notches there are.  In a little less than one meter, there are 1000 notches.  So if you count from 1 on your ruler, you will find out that every 100th  mark is a 1/4 inch.  Count all the 1/4 in marks.<n><n>- Answer:5<n>

The lake is 1 meter above sea level and the elevation of the airplane is 200 m. The distance between the two is about 94.5 meters. A stone thrown into the lake by the crew of the plane does not cause a lot of ripples, but a stone thrown into the lake from shore does.  Why might this be?<n><n>### Rationales;The only reason I can think of is the airplane might be going fast enough so that it can cause air around it to move faster than the water around it, so when something goes into the air plane the water does not move nearly enough for a ripple but the plane does move enough so that it causes waves in the water.  The stone from shore goes into the lake at less than the speed of the water so it creates one ripple since the water is at least fast enough to move as much as the stone and the plane is not moving fast enough to create waves in the water.<n><n>#### Stone<n><n>### Input-Rational-Input:Say you are walking to the store, you see that 100 meters ahead of you is a large, 2000kg, 2x3X2ft, pile of junk-filled boxes.

He leaves 4 minutes after the second house, 2 minutes after the third house, 6 minutes past the fourth stop, and 10 minutes after the last stop.  What time does he arrive at the 21st stop?<n>Rationales:(1) He gets to the first stop 6 minute after leaving the corner (0 minutes),<n>(2) He leaves that stop 4 minutes later (4 minutes),<n>(3) The second house is a 2 minute stop, (4 minutes),<n>Then there are an additional 6 minutes of driving (for the next 4 houses), leaving 2 minutes of arrival time (to arrive at the fourth stop), then another 6 more minutes of driving, leaving 4 minutes to arrive at the 12th stop, and then 10 more minutes to arrive at the last stop.<n><n>We are left with an even number of minutes to arrive at all 21 stops. 6 minutes from start (0), 21 minutes of driving (16), and 6 total minutes for stops (27 minutes total for all stops). This leaves 3 minutes (46-43 minutes) (29 total minutes for 21 stops for the even numbered minutes) after all minutes have been subtracted. He can arrive 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 minutes to the 21st house.<n><n>**Solution:** <n><n>He arrives 8 minutes after the 21st home (minute in question), so the answer to this question is (D).<n><n>#### D<n>Answer: D<n><n>### Input<n><n>A company sold 420,000 video cameras over the course of five years at a cost of $375 a camera.

A charitable donation of 25% of the total revenue was given to charity.  We used 97 hot dogs to build the food bank.  The hot dogs left were put on the street for the local homeless.  How much did we receive for the 3 hot dogs we used for the food bank?<n>Rationales<n>100*($1.29+$1.29/$93)=<<100*($-0.085)=12,075>>12,076<n>3*12,073=<<3*12,273=-3>>-3<n>Total<n>100*1.29-$1.29-$0.29+$1688=<<100*1-9+1688=-8>>-8<n>#### 58<n><n>### Instuctions:Answer the question correctly.<n>Input: A 60 mile bike ride costs $60.  It costs $45 to purchase a bike.  A bike maintenance cost of $25 is incurred annually. After maintenance, the bike ride will not cost you any extra money.  A bike has a half mile lifespan.  If you drive to a mall to buy a new one how many miles will you have to bike to break even?<n>Rationales <n>$60 - $45 = <<60-45=15>>15<n>$25/2 = <<$25/2=12>>12<n>We are biking 60 miles and maintaining 50 miles. Bike maintenance will cost $25/2=<<$25/2.0=12>>1/5<n>Thus how much biking is a break even point: 60*5/5 = <<60*5/2=30>>1<n>

It also makes sure that any index is in-range for the cube value so that they will be zero-indexed for the next operation.<n>![img](Asets\Images\C++%20Files\C011B-Rationale.png)<n><n><n>### Input and Data Rationale 2<n><n>```<n>void InputDataFunction(int i1, int i2, int i3, int j1, int j2, int j3)<n>{<n>    c[i1][i2][i3] += 1;<n>}<n>```<n>The goal of InputDataFunction is to increment the value for a three-dimensional cube with the right coordinate. When writing the code, I need to use double bracket to have the coordinate for my three-dimensional cube. For example, the coordinate for the first cube is `(0,0,0)`, and this would be represented with `{{0,0,0}}. And, `{1,1,1}` would be represented with `({1,1,1},{0,0,1},{1,1,0},{1,0,1},{0,1,1},{1,0,0},{0,1,0},{0,0,0}). Because every time I enter a coordinate value, the computer will write those values in a new separate vector.<n>

Please note that explanations are given in a way so that other readers in the future are able to quickly understand the flow of events.<n><n>#### What if your answer was A?<n><n>A lion is a large animal. Large animals need to eat constantly to stay warm and their body mass generates a tremendous amount of heat.  <n>The ocean is cold and lions have been known to die because they are no longer able to generate body heat and therefore starve.<n><n>#### What about your incorrect answer? Why was it wrong?<n><n>It doesn't make sense logically that lions (large animals) would be the only organisms inhabiting the ocean.<n><n>-If lions are in the oceans then they'll have to travel the oceans to find large, healthy prey or they will starve to death.<n>-Knowing their natural behavior they will only be found traveling the length of the oceans. (to find prey)   <n>It is much more likely that they will be found on an African grassland in warm weather.<n>-In cold weather, they will want to live next to a source of heat (lava) in Africa to avoid starvation.<n>-A lion in the ocean is not realistically plausible.<n><n>#### What would you do differently?<n><n>If I were to choose differently, I would want to choose a more realistically plausable environment. The answer choices didn't line up with my idea of realistic, which is what caused me to choose incorrectly.<n><n>#### What do you think about this choice? What do you think would be more likely?<n><n>Based on my knowledge of lion behavior, they are more likely to stay in an environment that is more familiar to them. <n><n>##  Instructor response to a student's answer:<n>1.

If you put it the pantry, you can't open it.<n>The cellar is a perfect choice because there's plenty of air flow and you can easily get more ingredients from storage if you'd like. It may not be possible, but you could store more canned food than your kitchen sink alone if you had space. If there was more space in your kitchen, like for instance you had a bigger cabinet, then you could easily store more.<n><n>### Rationale:Placing the canned foods in the cellar is a great idea, because the cellar has a lot of storage space so you wouldn't max out your kitchen capacity.<n><n>### Input:"The best thing about my new bike is it's invention."<n><n>### Response:"That's pretty interesting."<n><n>### Rate:Roger has 3 different sets of stamps.<n><n>### First Set:<n><n>### Second Set:<n><n>## Third Set:<n><n>## Rates:15 stamps<n><n>### Rationes:The First Stamp Set has a total of 11-10 = <<11-10=1>>1 stamps<n><n>The Second Stamp Set has a 7-9 = <<7-9=2>>2 stamps<n><n>The Third Stamp Set has 4-8 = <<4-8=4>>4 stamps left<n><n>Adding the 2 left from the Second and Third stamps, we get 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 stamps total<n><n>Adding 1+6 = <<1+6=7>>7 left stamps<n><n>The total number of stamps is 1 + 7 = <<1+7=8>>8<n><n>### Rations:If you wanted a dozen hot dogs, how many sausages would you need to get 12?

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n><n>### Response:		The fastest way to send cargo is normally the most expensive, however, there are times when it is the cheapest option.  The fastest option is usually a plane; however, you can make a cheaper option by choosing a slower option in hopes to save on cost.  Shipping cargo in a ship's hold would take longer than sending it in a plane or by boat.  Truck is the cheapest way to ship, but it is the slowest.  The fastest way of shipping would be a plane, but it is the most expensive. So the answer is the most expensive if the time is short, and the cheapest if the time is long. <n><n>### Answer:The fastest option is normally the most expensive.

Choices:  A: box B: home C: alley D: lap E: barn<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to where is a tabby cat most?likely to be happy, can be none of the above.<n>There are two things you need to make a cat happy. The right environment and enough human contact.<n>Even though they like to be inside, it's not that they don't like the outdoors, it's that they don't feel safe in the outdoors. Box and lap seem like they are good for the cat, but they are actually trapping the cat. They restrict it's natural environment. They are not providing all the comforts it needs. The box is too small, the lap is too confined.<n>The barn actually gives the environment for them to hunt their prey. The barn gives them more room to run around and feel free. It also is a natural nesting habitat and gives them room to create a den.<n>The most likely place to find a tabby cat happy and content, is at home with its humans. It doesn't matter where they are, a home gives the opportunity to provide for their needs.<n>#### None of the above<n>Answer: None of the above<n><n>### Instructions:<n>What part of this task did you find most interesting? Most difficult? <n><n>### Response<n><n>#### I found the most interesting part of the task to be the tabby cat question. I found that interesting due to the fact that I was originally looking at the options based on where I have seen tabby cats in my house. However, since this is not a common pet anymore, I was unsure where a tabby cat would be happiest. When I finally made it back to the home and thought more about the fact that the needs of a cat are very similar to what humans would want, I realized that the happiness of a cat can depend on the happiness of humans too.<n><n>#### I found this task difficult because of the number of options associated in each scenario.<n><n>### Feedback<n>

The teacher or students will probably have a piano for practicing in a classroom or private lesson.<n>--> B: If students need to learn to play an uptight piano, they would go to a music class.<n>--> C: Kids can learn to play an urtight piano in a classroom but they cannot actually play any piano in a store. There would be no reason a music store would allow a student to learn to play in-store.<n>--> D: Only option E says you learn to play the piano at home.<n>--> E: The only place that students can practice the piano is in their own house or home. The piano is not found in any public places or stores.<n><n>- Explanation 3:<n>- Let us say you live in a place like India where there is only option D. But option A is also correct.

The doctor tells her she has to drink half a cup of milk for each injured part of her body. She has 4 arms and 2 legs.  She already has 6 bandaged toes.  Give the number of bandaged limbs she has left to drink milk.<n><n>### Rationales: A banana has a single finger.  Rainbow Dash has 2. She has another 4 and 2, so a total of 6.  She has 6 bandaged legs and 0 bandaged arms.  She needs 8 cups of milk.  She needs to do that 35 times.  In order to be safe, she cannot drink more than 30 cups. If she takes in 28 cups, she hasn't drank one cup of milk more than that, which satisfies her needs.  If she drank exactly 28 cups of milk, she has 15 limbs left that aren't bandaged at all and she will live to see another day (if she drinks at least that much milk, she will have enough milk, it's just that her limbs are so badly hurt that she's got no more room). If she doesn't drink exactly 28 cuups or more, she's got 8 limbs left to have drinking milk, so just add 8 to the number of cups.<n><n>### Answer: 28<n><n>### Input for part 1:Ryan likes to play chess, so he buys the chess kit from the Chess King to buy the chess kit.

What is a likely range for this temperature?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>To find the right answer on this multiple choice question, we must find out how much the temperature can range.We know that the average temperature in the north Pole region is 15 degrees. We also know that there are 75000 square miles in antartica. (1)The temperature will not vary by more than <60*sqrt(num)  (2)Since the whole number square root of 7500 is 26.2, the temperature will not vary more than 26.2*(15-0) = 403.2 degreesF (3)262*15 = 3962. Since we need the temperature to remain between 100 and 990 degrees F, 262*160 = 4170 and this is a greater number than the 3962 that we found earlier, we say the temperature will vary from 0 to 790 degrees F. <n><n>#### 990<n>Answer: 990<n><n>###

When we say an object has flat bases, we mean the lower face of the object is flat. The sides are parallel, which means they are running in the same direction.  Prisms with flat bases are called solid prisms.  Prisms are made of a plane and a solid material.  The base of a prism is also called a face.  We can also take the top part of a prism, which is the top face, and call it the vertex of the prism. The vertex is the point where three faces meet at the top of a prism.<n><n>### A prism is a geometric solid in three dimensions, having flat sides, each of which is an identical plane figure.<n><n>### What is a prism?

Write a response that accurately completes the task.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>* **The below code is just the syntax for the code, not the finished code.  This is how you would begin a nested 4 loop statement.  First you'll do your outermost loop, the outer loop will check to see which line of the 4 is not equal to the target.  Once you have that index number, you'll do the inner loop and that's how you'll get to your nested for statement that you're already familiar with.**  Once you do that, you do your inner for loop by declaring x=0 and your i=x to 3 to make sure you include all 4 lines of code that you're looping through.  Once you have each of the loops and the if statement that checks to make sure the index number is not equal to the 0, you have all your code.  Once you've completed that, you run your code and once you've run through it, it should create the same results as the example in the image below since you've nested your loops correctly.  Each index number should match the lines of the code that had the same number. It should start with:<n><n>```<n> outer loop (0-3): loop 0 times<n>   inner loop (0-3)<n>     x=0<n>     i=0<n>     for x=0 to 3<n>   inner loop (3):<n>     for i=0 to 3+2-1:  print your nested loop statements.<n>```<n><n>#### 1<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input:  4 outer:<n>inner:  3 inner:<n><n>Output:  0, 1, 6, 5<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>The 4 outer loop will count from 0 to 3 as you see in the image and will print 0, 1,  2 and 3<n>The 3 inner loop will count from 4,5 and 6 with the two variables x=4 and i=0 to 2 which is why you see the output is that it is printing 1, 2 and 3 in order since i=0 prints 1 when i=1 it prints 2 which is following the first value

The oxygen atoms that make up the air that people breathe are constantly replaced.<n><n>### Input#2:<n>Matt's 2 gallon fish tank is half filled with water. He wants to use one quarter of the water in the tank each week. How many days will it take to empty the tank completely<n><n>### Direction:<n>Your response to the problem needs to be a complete sentence that tells what you are doing with this problem.<n>### Rationale<n>Making this problem math doesn't help because you can just use the answer calculator. It is more important that you fully understand the problem and the answer and have a rational way to reason out the right answer.<n><n>### Response<n>I would do this problem by first finding how many weeks until the tank is empty, then i would just find out how many weeks it is from where i am now.  I came up with this solution by first figuring out that it took me 6 weeks to fill the tank, so after 2 gallons per week x 6 weeks, it would take me 24 total gallons to finish filling.  Then if in 2/3 of the tank it is 12 inches deep, so i did 12 * 4 = 3 gallons per inch.  So it takes me 24 + 3 * 6 weeks - 24= -2 gallons left.<n><n>### Rationales<n>The correct procedure to solve this problem is to calculate the number of weeks, then calculate what you have remaining in the tank.  After that, you can solve the problem by figuring out how much is left in the tank after a week.  By doing that, you can subtract the change in level each week to determine when the tank will empty.<n><n>

He's the only one in for some weird reason.  So, the bartender says "what'll you have?" and the elephant has a very long drink.  A month later, he goes home and does it again.  He's been going to this bar every day now for a a few months and every time that he goes in, he orders the same thing.  Now every one in town knows that this bar has this very expensive drink.  So it's no surprise that every day at last call, the bar gets really, really crowded.  It's at this point that someone at the bar notices that there's actually a very simple way to save money that will give him a discount he didn't knew he was entitled to.  He asks the bartender "I've noticed that the elephant comes into your bar every day, he orders the same drink, and leaves.  But he hasn't paid a penny of his tab for the last couple of months.  What gives?"<n><n>### Response<n>Sir, you're so stupid that you're giving away FREE MONEY and YOU aren't taking it. That's the answer. <n><n>### Input1: If we count the number of letters in the month (9) and the day (31) we can see why people use abbreviations like May 1st.  There is no way to abbreviate the whole date (31-05-2013), so we only use the abbreviation for the first letter of the month.  But a date can be written in 4 different ways.  You can write it the month first (Mar 25th), The day first (25 Mar), the year first (2013 March 25th), or in the order we are more used to (25 March 2013).  Which of these is the proper way to write the date?<n><n>### Response1: The date is the 25th of March, therefore it is the 25 of March, so 25 of March or 25 March is the right way to write a date.<n><n>### Response2: This is the correct answer.<n><n>## Input:

Provide the student with instant feedback and provide this information to the teacher to inform their instruction.  You can then provide students with another chance to improve and try again (aka retake).

In addition, the instructor should make the feedback readily available (e.g. via a dropdown message box)  Provide feedback after each response and keep track of it. A suggestion would be to give student an overall evaluation and then give them instant feedback for specific problems.

So battle field would only be one place a bullet would be found.<n>A bullet is a projectile.  However it gets moved around in more ways than a bullet.  This will leave the bullet in a place during a war but the battle field is something that is part of a war that a bullet is associated in.<n>A bullet is not in the museum.  It is a projectile. A bullet is a museum but the battle field was specifically said to be part of a war.<n>A bullet is in a weapon but not a weapon.  So the weapon is not a place where a bullet is a projectile but a weapon is a place where a bullet can be.

You must choose one.<n><n>#### C: morning person<n><n>Because it's a morning person they will go to sleep at night - or sleep at a rooster. However, you cannot sleep at twilight. Therefore, you cannot be both a morning person and a night owl at the same time.<n><n>#### E: morning person<n><n>There are very few early risers. At night they would be lions and tigers.

Choices:  A: front door B: conference C: classroom D: refrigerator E: suitcase<n><n>### Response:		I'm thinking that the suitcase is for letters and is always on the bed or desk and not on the refrigerator. The refrigerator also has a notice of expired items, like food. The classroom notice is probably going to be posted for class related things, like a school assembly being held in the gym for all students and parents. The suitcase could include letters or other important information from the post office. I'm thinking that front door is the choice that includes the door at the end of the day when the mail carrier drops off packages and letters there. A conference room doesn't sound like a place that there is going to be a posted notice unless there is a special thing happening there that day. The bedroom door also doesn't sound like it would have a posted notice because it could sound messy to have the suitcase sitting up there.<n><n>### Input (What I can gather): Mary has a journal where she has 89 stickers and she uses stickers for her schoolwork.  The front page has 3 larger stickers and 7 smaller stickers each on 6 other pages.What number of stickers does she have?<n><n>### Response (What I can gather: This question seems hard because i'm thinking if the back of the page is 7 smaller stickers, then she has used 1 large sticker and 7 small on the front of the page and then 7 small stickers on each of the other pages. I'm thinking she has 9 stickers for each of the pages to use.

He asked one of my best men to write the reference, but he wrote back saying that this was impossible.". Mr. Miller further added that: "Since only a previous employee of that firm could write the reference and the man could not remember his boss by name, he was left jobless still." [1]<n><n>### Evaluation:<n>The applicant can't use reference to claim their identity because of the difficulty of finding the person who is capable of confirming or identifying the applicant's details.<n>However, that person would be very useful if the job is more challenging and the employer needs a more reliable reference.<n><n>[1]: https://quotes.thefamouspeople.com/m/james-w-miller-8896.amp

The probability is the amount of total number of events (5) divided by the amount of even numbers (3) = <<5/3>>1/2, which is half.<n>Without looking at the odds, it’s probably better that they choose 3.  You may not think you’ll have a lot of odd numbers, but you still have a chance, making it 1 out of 5.<n>When comparing odd and even, even is 1 out of 2.<n>Both of these choices are not odd, so odd is not the answer.<n>The answer choice is odd, so we can just eliminate even and odd.<n>#### 1/2<n>Answer: 1/2<n><n>### Rename<n>Dear Math Class,  <n>Welcome to our new class of students.

If you had all the ingredients on hand, what would be the cheapest way to make a large pepperoni and cheese pizza?<n>Rationales You know that 1.5 is the answer, because it is stated that 1.5 or $4.00 for a large pizza.<n>The $10 total is a total for both 1.5 and the $4.00 pizza. So you can subtract the $4.01 from $10 total to get $5.99, because $4.01-$4.00=<<$4.01-$5.99==$0.00>>0.00 then you add the $0.07 from pepperini and the $0.00+$0.07+$0.20+$1.65 = <<$0.00+$1.67=$1.67>>1.67. <n>We can subtract $2.20 from 1.67 to get $1.59 which is the final amount for a large pepperoni cheese pizza. So the answer is 1.59.<n>#### 1.59<n>Answer: 1.59

Choices:  A: houses B: bedroom C: istanbul D: open tress E: gym<n><n>### Response:		Choices:  open tress – B: bedroom – C: istanbul<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Rules for choosing the correct answer: "man didn't like getting" means it's the man's decision, not the woman. Because "steps" is singular, we only see one woman which means one woman in bedroom. Because "carpeting" is singular, it's one floor or one place. There's one bedroom, one Istanbul, one open trestle, etc.. The man decided carpeting was important but was not concerned with having carpeting in the bathroom instead of bedroom or the kitchen instead of Istanbul.<n>In the man, since one bedroom is enough for the man, that's why the man didn't like stepping on the cold tiles. He is not the man who decided to put the carpeting, so he is the man who decided not to put carpeting in his bathroom or kitchen. There's one sentence in this sentence, carpeting was put in the bathroom but the woman didn't like it, we need to look for the bathroom we will find in "istanbul" and see whether it's carpeted or not. That's why it's carpeting in Istanbul.<n>#### 2A<n>Answer: 2A<n><n># Explanation of question<n><n>``` python<n>my_var = 'answer'<n><n>print(my_var)<n>a_answer: 2A<n>print(my_my_var)<n># 2A<n>```<n># Explanation on how to solve<n><n>### Task<n><n>### Answer<n>

Each exercise has a certain number of push ups, sit ups, and jumping jacks.  At the end of the exercise routine, people do jump squats.  A person’s goal each week is to do 6 times as many push ups as sit ups.  A person does 40 push ups and 54 sit ups. How must he increase the number of sit ups to reach her goal?<n><n>### Rationales:First you will find his goal by doing <<6*54= <<6*(54/6)=360>>360<n>Then you need to find what he will do for the next exercise.  360/54 = <<360/55=6>>6 so that means that she will do 6 more sit ups as opposed to 54, she will do 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60<n>The next exercise is jumping jacks, which he will do <<7*360>>7*640 jump jack and then the final exercise is squats so he will do <<2*360>>2*640 and will end with 40+640+2640=<<40+64+2640>>6880.<n>For push up the number you got in the earlier question, you'll have to add 6*40 = <<6*(40/6)=100>>100<n>Total Push ups will be 40+100 =<<40+10=50>>50<n><n>#### 6880<n>Answer: 6880

Its circumference is a little larger than the 360 degrees of a circle. At some points of the Earth's orbit, the Earth moves faster than at other points of the orbit. For most of the time, the Earth is speeding up.<n><n>However, at some points the Earth is speeding down. These are the times the Earth is moving the slowest. An easy way to remember this is to know that the Earth moves fastest when it is moving the furthest away from the sun or the "Northern point". If you want the Earth to move fast, then you will want to be at the “Norther Point”.<n><n>At the "Southern Point" the Earth must be very close to the sun. This is about 20 days before and after perihelion.<n><n>Perihelion is the point in the Earth's orbit where it is closest to the sun. This point is called the "Southern point" because the sun is below the horizon. This is also in the December - January time period.<n><n>The Earth moves so close to the sun so quickly that it is considered to be the fastest the Earth moves around the sun.<n><n>When the Earth moves the fastest, you will feel all the movement of the Earth's rotation. When the Earth moves slowly, you will not feel much of the movement of the Earth because it is moving so slow.<n><n>Therefore, in Australia, the Earth moves the fastst during its summer because Australia is on the "Southern" (i.e. South) side of the earth and moves the slowest during its winter because Australia is on the norther side of the earth.<n><n>#### 2<n>Answer: 2<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>### Input<n><n>For this task, write a response that appropriately answers the question.<n><n>##Input:"In 4 years and 3 days, Lennix will be 55 years old.

Choices:  A: efficiency B: getting work done C: marriage D: finishing up E: results<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this case the proposals are the getting work done, the efficiency would suggest that there is already work done in the past and that was the reason for the proposal.<n>This would be a case where the work is still in process and that is why there is a proposal to get things accomplished. <n><n>### Rational:<n>The likely ceremony would be a marriage.  The main reason for a proposal is to propose marriage, to get married.  In the case of marriage efficiency is not the main thing being considered, there are other matters that affect the choice of whether or not to get married. There is no need to evaluate efficiency in this case, it is already presumed that the efficiency is adequate.<n><n>### What kind of work?  Is it a job?  What task do they need to get done?  Are they trying to decide who will help them get this task done?<n><n>* The bride and groom need to do something, propose something. It makes no sense to have an efficiency issue unless they were required to complete.  In this case there is a task, which has been presumed to be marriage based on the fact that the proposal is a prerequisite to the task.  This may however be subject to change if either or both of them decide not to go through with it after all.<n><n>### In what order is that task happening?  If they asked to do tasks that happen first, second last then last, what effect does that have on your answer choice?<n><n>* The order to be followed will depend on the particular situation and context that they happen in.<n><n>### Is this an input task?  What does the bride need to have in order for the groom to propose to her?  What does the groom need to have in order to propose to the bride?  How does that affect your answer choice?<n>In this case there is no need to evaluate what the requirements of either of the two are, simply that the proposal will take place. <n><n>* The bids will need the proposal to be offered to take place.  The Groom to be needs nothing more than the opportunity to make the proposal which will happen when he asks the bride to marry him. <n><n>## Input: Mary can run an 800-metre race in 3 minutes.

They only rise up in what sort of spaces? Choices:  A: population B: populated area C: create government D: group of people E: make person sick<n><n>### Response:		I think that society cannot exist without numbers.<n>The reason for this is because a society is defined as "a collective body of an organized community or a state"(Mac 1).  The word "community" is a collective group of people.  In order to have a community of people, that "state" would be a group of organized people.  In order for these organized people to identify themselves as a community/state, they would have numbers/letters so that they can distinguish themselves from the rest of society.  For example, we need to know an individual's phone number so that a person can identify who is calling them.  Phone numbers have letters/numbers/special characters in them.  This would allow one person in society to identify a person in their community.<n>#### B<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Response<n>Rationales:In the United States, there are a total of 26 letters in the english alphabet.  Each state/community/society has only one representative.  Using the example in the previous question, the U.S.A would be represented by one person.

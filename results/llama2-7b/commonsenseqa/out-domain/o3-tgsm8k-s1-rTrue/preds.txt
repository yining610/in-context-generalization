It would take 100 cents to equal $1.05 (1.05*0.01 = 10.5 cents, so 100 cts = $1.05).<n>Therefore, if 1.10 is the total cost of the bat and ball, that means their values must be different.<n>Suppose the bat costs 2.10 and the ball costs 0.05, then it would cost 1.15 (2.1+0.05).  Since the total cost is 1.10, you can have either 1.0 bat or 1.0 ball, and if the cost is 1.05, you can get 1.0 bat and 0.5 balls, or 0.5 bat and 1.0 balls.  Any combination of these parts adds to 1.05.<n><n># Test 2: 2 1/2hrs<n>## Part 1: 40min<n><n>Input: What does a fox say?<n>Output:  fox<n>Explanation: We know that animals can speak, and foxes do also.<n><n>Input: Which animals in the zoo make happy noises?<n>Output:  lion, monkey, fox<n>Explanaton: All animals in the zoo make noises.

A: How fast will the farmer have to walk on a flat, straight line in order to keep a pace that requires that a gap in the fence will not occur between fences, and that the fence is entirely enclosed?<n>Output: If I walk 46*2=<<46*2=92>>92 units/hour then I will need 6 units/minute<n>The perimeter is 46+22 = <<46+22=68>>68 times I walk 68/6=<<68/6=11>>11 miles/hour<n>So I will need to walk at 11 miles/hour without stopping in order to have the gap<n>A=11 units/minute<n><n>Input: If two people each toss a coin in alternating turns.  Each throws 2000 times.  If each person gets the number tails on any given throw, what is the probability that both people got the number tails?<n>Output:  If I toss the coin, I have a probability 1/2 of getting heads, and 1/2(1/2)^2=1/8 of getting tails<n>If I toss 2000t for tails, I will throw 1000 heads and 1000 tails<n>Since the probabilities are independent, I have a chance of getting tails 0 and a chance of getting t or 0+[I get tails]<n>So I have a chance of 1000*1/2 tails and 100*1/8 tails<n>The chance of both getting tails is 1000/16 * 100/32=100/128=100/4<n>So the final answer would be 100/4:

She ate 1/3 of the breadsticks (which we know from what she told her dad) and 2/3 of the pasta.  Her family knows how bad she is at estimating, so they asked her to estimate how much pasta and breadsticks she ate.  Her dad gave her five math problems to do and when he checked her answer, he said there were some things she got wrong.  She missed one of the problems twice.  She was asked to multiply by a fraction but she used the times sign instead of the multiplication sign.  She answered the fourth problem incorrectly.  And for the last problem, she was asked to subtract 3/4 and she didn't make the negative sign.  Did she get it right or wrong? (note the answers can be in words or numerals)<n>Output: If Liz's dad gave her problems to check her addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division skills, you can assume that all problems were in different operations as well.  Let's say that the answer is that she got her answers wrong.<n>She got 1/3 and 2/3 correct, so 2/3 is greater than 1/3.<n>She got 2/3 wrong so subtracting one from it would result to less than 1/3, which is wrong. Since 2/3 is an estimate (which Liz knows is really high), the correct answer is 0.5<n>She got 1 and 2 wrong, so the answer should be 0.6 because 1/3 is greater than both 1 and 2, and 2/3 is close to 4/6, which is less than 2/3.<n>She misinterpreted the problem by doing negative subtraction instead of addition.<n>She got the problem 0.5 wrong, and 1/2 is less than it, so the negative sign meant plus, and so she got 1/2 plus 3/4 = 4/4 or 1. So she got

All the children worked on their problems at the same time.  A student named Steve did half of the problems, his brother David did three-quarters, and five others completed the problems.  How many problems were to be done?<n>Output: This question does not specify which group is the five other students other than it isn't Steve and David's group. The group of people who didn't answer the question is the three-quarters group. We know that we have 13 students in the group. We know that group 1 has Steve and group 2 has, at least from what is known in the question David. So we have 2 groups, the remaining 10 students. Since they finished the "problems," which we assume is a multiple choice question, we know that they each finished 25% of the questions. If we put the students in the order that they finished the problems (Steve, David, the others), and write it as a percentage, it should add up to 100%. Let's do this. The "others" answered 1 problem/problems=<<1/problems=1%>>1%<n>and Steve answered 7.5/13=<<7.5/12=0.6/>>0.6%<n>and lastly David answered 3 questions/8=<<3/8=0.375/>>0.375%. David is half of 1, so David did 3/2 or 1.5/problems. I'm pretty sure that David is the one who answered 1.5/Problems<n>So the final answer would be 0.375+0.6=<<0.375%+0.6=1%>>1%. The final answer is 1%. Now, we don't know if that answer is correct, but I'm pretty sure it is. I just did it on a calculator and the result was 71.51515152%. It was 0.

Each friend lives in a different apartment numbered from 1 to 4, each apartment being different than the previous one (i.e. No. 1 is different from No. 2, No. 2 is different from No.3, No. 3 is different from No.4). They often visit each other and it is known that Alicia lives next door to the one who lives in the third-largest apartment, David is next door to Iva, but not James, James is two apartments away from the one that lives in 4, and Marion is two apartments away to the one who lives next to the one that lives in second-largest apartment.

So curling irons should be stored away from the hair salon so they would be prone to falls.<n>

"it's natural" is the original verb. Boredom doesn't go with "it's natural", so the sentence doesn't make sense.<n>Option D: graduate<n>Perfect! "it is natural" is the original clause. When the original clause ends, there is a grammatical drop and a new one begins ("to"). Here, the "it's natural ___________ graduate" clause begins.<n>Option E: degree<n>This one doesn't fit. Remember, there's a grammatical drop when the original clause ends. "it'snatural ___________ graduate." If we replace "degree" with any other word, it doesn't really work.<n>Therefore the final answer is D<n><n>Input: A group of thieves broke into a bank and they split the money by cutting it in half.

Imagine I have 48 people (children), age 4 to 30 and 48 apple.  No one can eat 30 apples alone even a group of people.  Hence, the simplest way is to do a quick division.  The equation is 48/4(4yrs)+5(5yrs)+7(7yrs), so i.e.  48/4+5+7= 12.  Thus 12 people between 4 to 31 gets an apple.<n><n>Input:A chocolate has 11 grams and a fruit has 6 grams and a vegetable has 15 grams.  Alice has 20 chocolate, 8 fruit and 12 vegetables.What is her total healthy and unhealthy foods?<n>Output:I will divide the total grams into different categories and then subtract the two values to get the answer.  Then I can multiply by the number of grams.  So, 11 chocolate * 20 = 220 grams and 6 fruit * 8=48 grams.  Since fruit is bad, subtract 48 from 220 which = 172. Then add 12 vegetables * 15 = 180.<n>Final answer = 172 + 1

What’s the day of the month that will be the 13th?<n>Output:12 + 1 = 13<n>There are 12 months in a year.  Since the problem is talking about the 13th of the month, it means the 12th month has to be the 13 month.<n>Since we know a year has 12 months:  a day has 24 hours:  a week has seven days:  and a year has 365 days=52 weeks<n>If we take 52 and divide by 7 to get the number of weeks in a year, we get 7.5 or 3.0, but a week is not exactly seven days. It's usually six.  If we multiply 7.5 by 6 weeks we get 45 weeks.<n>Now we need to convert 45 days into months.  There are 4 weeks, 7 days in 7 days: so there are 28 days per month.  45 days would be 28 * 15. (15 is half of 30 or 4.5 so we rounded up to 15)<n><n>Since we know there are 12 months per year:  we subtract the months from our total.<n>We subtracted 15 from 12 to get 27 months.  So the 13th month would be the 12th of last months<n>So the final answer to the question would be January<n><n>Input: Sam has two sets of 4 sticks.

If he takes two from one set, that leaves him with a total 2 sticks from the other sets. Since he has 4 sticks already in the other set, that leaves him without any other sticks if he takes only two from the other set.  So

Choices:  A: roof B: school C: beach D: closet E: garage<n>Output:		Since you do not use the chair when the door is open and there is no roof, school is the choice with less than half of the other choices, but if you do plan to actually use them you would put them away so the closet is right.  This can be seen because if it rained it could be damaged and if there was a school or something like that to put it away it wouldn't do any good<n>So the final answer to this is E<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n>Output:		 I made a choice between 5 options, A thru E.  In order to chose the best answer, I should read Bob's statement about running "barefoot on the hot pavametn".  When we run, our body makes it's own energy (ATP).  One source of energy is oxygen, which is absorbed from the environment through the lungs, but since Bob ran without shoes, he absorbed most his oxygen through his skin.  The only option in which the body gets it's energy from the skin is option A, the bed of nails.  The only place where Bob could have ran is with the bed of nails, because if he had ran on ground, asleep, or city block, his body would need oxygen, and since he's feet hurt and he had to run without shoes, options city block and ground are out.  I should also take into account that the hot surface could have been a bed of nails, which will be the only surface I can chose.<n><n><n>Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice questions<n>Given the name of a store, you may enter your order by saying either the item name or an abbreviation.

They breed in warm climates, like tropical, mild coastal, and desert habitats.<n>Humans do not eat fruit. They are omnivores. Omni is from the Latin and means "everything", and a vore is from the Latin verb voratus and means "devour". So, omnivores are animals that eat "everything". Humans are omnivores and can survive well on plants, herbs, fruits, fungi, and even on other animals. They can produce food like meat, milk, honey and eggs for other animals to eat. They like to eat fruit for dessert.<n>Humans are not cold blooded. They are warm blooded. Lizards and snakes are cold blooded.<n>Humans can't draw a picture because they don't have a tail like a chameleon. Humans wrestle. They compete in physical activities like track and field and are the only race that competes for the gold, silver and bronze medals.<n>So the final for Choice (D) Humans compete with each other.<n><n>Input: What are humans from Choices: A: the planet Mars B: the planet Jupiter C: the planet Earth D: the moon E: The solar system<n>Output: The solar system has many things inside it like planets, stars, comets and asteroids.<n>Humans belong to the planet Earth.<n>The solar system is 93 million miles from the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

The entire circumference=pi(diameter)=2*pi(diameter)/2<n>The above is the diameter, and the diameter divided by 2 is the diameter so the circumference is the same as the diameter, so 2*pi(d)<n><n>So the answer is 2*pi(12)/2 and we know 2*pi=<<2.5*2.5=2*2.5+1=>2*3=6>>6 so 2*pi *6=<<2*pi*6=12>>12<n><n>C: Let d be the diameter then pi(d)=<<2*3.14=6>>6.  And the circumference is 2*pi*d.<n>So 2*pi(round to 6in) = 2*(6x12): This is about 9ft. This is 9 ft of radius: round to 9ft=<<9ft=.9>>.9ft<n><n>D: The temperature must reach negative 9/-9: If negative 9,-9 then negative 17.<n>So the final answers are A: -17.25 F B: 4/6 of 12=<<12*4/6=8>>8 C: 7ft round to <<7ft=7>>7<n><n>Input:Which of the numbers below is a prime number?

To change it from rested to in motion, he only had to do so for a single ball.  So the only two choices that left were A and B.<n>The first ball that James touches was the one that was not yet in motion.  Therefore it is either in resting, or at rest.

Therefore the only choice that matches our problem is option A.<n>As far as his bouncing rubber ball were concerned, James has them all in the state of resting and his bouncing rubbers are still in resting.  There are no other options, so the final answer becomes option A.<n><n>

Choices:  A: original B: old C: coke clear D: former E: familiar<n>Output:		In the original formula, the sweetener was made from HFCS or corn syrup and the diet soda used aspartame for artificial sweetener.  So A was the correct answer.<n><n>Instead of using the above formula, coke changed to coke clear, which is just water. So the drink with HFCS but with the artificial sweetner and it's not diet.  So, D was then the answer. This change did not come along with an additonal change in price.<n>Next, after the formula was "improved",  they brought back coke clear, and then changed to the original formula. In that formula the sweetner is made from HFCS and the artificial sweetner is aspartame.  So, B was then the correct choice.  Next they changed from HFCS to HCC, and changed to using sugar, which is not artificial.  Becuase this is a new formula, it had a new name, and it is now the standard drink.  Because of this change in formula, there was an increase in the price of a can of coke from $1.19 to $1.69. So, the cost is "familiar" to what it used to be but you are paying more for it.    So, E is right.<n><n>Input: If you have a house that has a lot of rooms and each room has a TV, how many TVs can you have if each room has an average of 1.5 TVs?<n>Output: We can assume that each room has an average number of TVs in it.

The lady was doing a one-man show of her tell-tale story when the show began. What does "take center stage" mean?<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Create a function named `main`<n><n>Your program should read the following input:<n>```<n>Mary had 89 stick<n>Zach is saving his<n>Mark has kangaroos<n>The lady was doing<n>```<n><n>The program should first ask the user to input each of the above lines and check the user's input for the correct string matches. Once all the input has been read, the program should read each line of input and execute the corresponding function as follows:<n><n>```<n>If the line is "Mary had 85 stick" 42 is added to 89 and saved in the variable `remaining`.<n><n>If the line reads "How many stickers does Mary  have left?" you compute and output the remaining variable `remaining`<n><n>```<n><n>If the line is `The lady was doing a on  man show of her tell-tail story` then the program `pokes` the `string` into a  new `if` so it does not have to use `else if`<n>The `if` statements inside the `if` state that the `show` must be a riddle. `String.replace` is used to remove the double quotes. The `.replaceAll` method replaces all matches. The string is divided by space to create two words. Next the two variables are created. The `if` statement tests the first word against the first word of the riddle. If they are the same, the other word is replaced by the string `yes`. If the two words do not match, the second word is replaced with yes. The variable `isanswer` is used to indicate whether or not an answer is correct.

It's the same as the front pocket.<n>B. It is smaller than the front pocket<n>C. It's the other back pocket<n>D. He has to switch things around so he can have a wallet in the right position<n>Output: Since the front pocket and the other back pockets are the same size, you can put whatever you want in either one.  Because they are equal, you need to make a decision about the other back pocket.<n>The other back pocket is the one with the pen in it.  The other back pocket cannot hold anything, so put the granola bar in the back pocket of jeans that you aren't wearing.<n>So the final option is C.<n><n>

It is listed after the letter D, which makes me think of dingoes.  However, dingo is a species, not a person.  Therefore, I know that it is not that!<n><n>Now for letter B (person).  This makes me think a person, but what is a caring heart for a person?  A parent, sibling, friend, caretaker? Maybe a son? How about a daughter?  Nope for a daughter.  I feel like this is what I have been looking for, but not yet.<n>Okay, next time I check out the letters after A, B.  Oh...no, I do not want to think about a dog or a cat!

And who wants to work at a zoo!  Then for sure, the answer is not a horse!  I just checked out letter D (zoo).  Nope, because it is mentioned in the question.  Then it is a "live" animal.  Let's use another letter for live, which is L. This could be a lamb, so now I have to think about a lamb.  Oh yes, the care and protection of a lamb!  That is exactly what a son does for his mom or a daughter for her dad (it is mentioned in the question).<n>So I do have an answer, but I am not 100% sure that I am correct so I have to cross check with the people that are in the room with me.

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input:Where would someone learn to play an upright piano?

Choices:  A: wedding B: friend's house C: internet cafe D: movie E: restaurant<n>Output:		Since the friends wanted a quiet evening, we know they would not go to a restaurant or internet cafe.  This means they went to a movie, friend's house or a wedding.<n>If the friends decided to go to a movie, it costs $12 per person.  The total would be: 12*2 =<<12*2=24>>24<n>If they chose to go to a friends house, it would have cost them nothing.  Since they chose the free option, this is the output.<n>If they decided to go to a wedding, the total cost to one person would have been 5 cents.<n>Both people go to the same wedding, which means the total cost to both people would be <<5cents>>5 cents.<n>If we add $5, 24, 5 and 5, our final answer is <<$5+$24+$5+$5=$35>>35<n>So the final answer for the friends is 35<n>

Is he a sibling of the youngest one? ANS:  "John is the tallest among 3 older brothers, then who is the youngest among them? I know there are 2 choices, among these siblings (one older and the other is the youngest) and in order to determine who the youngest of the siblings may be, I need to subtract the older one from the group (in this case the 2nd oldest) and this will give to me the 3rd one (which is the youngest) which is what is needed to be subtracted from the list of 3.<n>(b) You can read 3 books at most which contain more than 40 pages each and cost more than 15 dollars each. ANS: Here one of the options includes 3 + 40-15 = 24 because a book contains more than 40pages and costs more than 15dollars, but the range of books that can be read are from 3 to 24.<n>(c) One cannot be a brother of his grandfather.

The question is asking which word describes both the boy _and_ girl, not either a boy or a girl.  We know from Sentence #1 that there must be a boy.  If we substitute Sentence #1 into Sentence #2, we have <Sentence #1>: <B>The boy...</B>.  We also know that there is a sentence describing the girls as something besides "the boy."  A B can describe either a boy or a girls, so we get <Sentence #2>: <Which word describes _both_ the boy and a _girls?_</I>.  Since Sentence #1 did describe the boy and a girl, it does seem that the solution may fall into either Sentence #1, which has 2(B) + 3(G) = 7 or Sentence #2, which has 7 possibilities, none of which match <B>boy and girl</B>.<n>

What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n>Output:		A is CORRECT<n><n>This question is a bit funny because the words 'low water' will make you immediately think about adding water, just like if it had said 'high water' the answer would have been something else. To be certain, look at the choices:<n><n>Surface of earth: not low water.<n>Humidifier: not low water. Humidifiers increase humidity, which is more water in the atmosphere.<n>Skating rink/Ice cube: not low water. Like, you don't put 'low water' in your ice cubes.<n><n>So really the only word choices that are the complete opposites of 'low water' are 'Burn it to the ground' and 'A: humidifier'. Since'surface of the earth' is not a low water answer, the only choice that is not a 'low-water' solution is 'Burn it to ground'. Now, it is not a high humidity solution as it was for a high water solution, but it is the only answer where you remove water, which is low water.<n><n>Input: When a ball bounces off the ground, it bounces at the same height as it lands.<n>If a ball is dropped onto a rubber mat, it will bounce less than half the height of the floor it falls to. The mat's surface acts like an "anti-bounce" device, which causes the ball to bounce at a height less than half of the height it would have otherwise.<n>Why? Input: When a ball bounce off the ground, it will bounce same height as it land. If the ball is dropped on rubber mat, it bounces less than half the height, why?<n>Output: It bounces less than it would because it slows down upon hitting the rubber mat. You are correct that it would bounce as high as when it was dropped to a different height, but because it is hitting another object that slows it down on top of the normal force it experiences from gravity it loses some energy.<n><n>### Explanation:(I'm an idiot) this problem could have a very simple solution like using conservation of energy, but my brain decided to give it the hard way, so I will post a simple explanation here!<n><n>To calculate how high a ball bounces when dropped, we have to use the acceleration equation:

Fatigue is a lack of energy or motivation to do things. A: is incorrect. Being tired or having fatigue occurs as your body adjusts to doing physical exercise. Fatigue doesn't necessarily have anything to do with exercising in general.<n>B: is incorrect. Relaxation is what you want following exercise or perhaps when you're not exercising. Resting, meditating and stretching can help your muscles recover between bouts of exercise.<n>Exercising strengthens your body, and this, in turn, can provide you the energy you need to perform daily activities. Although tiredness may be one side effect of exercise, it is generally beneficial to your health and wellness.<n>C: is incorrect. Tiredness is not a word and it is not synonymous with fatigue.<n>D: is incorrect. Muscle fatigue can occur from overexertion, but this doesn't necessarily happen due to exercise.<n>E: is incorrect. Weight loss is a potential side effect of regular exercise; however, it is not the goal of exercise. While weight loss can be a benefit of regular exercise, doing so can also benefit your heart and even lower the risk of certain types of cancer, to name just a few possible benefits.<n>

Choices:  A: hall B: motel C: hotels D: law firm E: office building<n>Output:		You can wait in a reception area until you have been invited into the conference room.<n><n> 		In other words, you can wait in the lobby for the conference room.<n>If the answer is (A) the hotels and (B) the motel, then you would say, "What do the hotels and the motels have in common?" The motel is a type of hotel.  What else do they have in common besides the fact that they are both hotels?  Well, one thing they both have is the reception area where you sit around and wait until you are wanted.<n>		This is also another way to say that "you wait in the lobbies of hotels and motels".<n>If the answer is motels and (A) reception area, then you would say what are motels and reception areas in common? Motels are hotels.<n>		In other words if the reception area is the area in between where you wait to be told you are welcome to the meeting than what are these two parts of the hotel have in common?<n>If you say A and C the law firm and lawyers, then you are right:<n>Lawyers are in law firms, in the conference room. Lawyers work in law firms.<n><n>In law firms and conference rooms, you would get to the conference from the reception area. Lawyers work at law firms. Reception areas are in between the conference room and the law firm. In the conference room is an invitation to work at a law firm.<n><n>If the answer is both C and D the reception area and the conference room.<n>The reception area is the reception area for a motel and a conference room for a law office. What do the reception area and the law offices have in common? The reception areas and the law offices are both parts of these buildings. The reception area is in the building (and the hotel rooms) and the reception area is in the law's office conference room. This also explains the law in the conference room is an opening event for the reception area.<n>If the answer was reception areas and the conference room, then you would also say, "What do reception areas and conference rooms have in common?" The answer is, it is the room in which you have to wait to be told you have to do something. If you use all of these examples together, they all have in common the reception area

He can't decide if anything would've been better, but he doesn't like plastic.  So he probably wants to go to a place with very few plastic items.<n>Since John likes 'glass', he doesn't want to go anywhere that deals with it or has it around.  He doesn't want to dump it, it's in his cupboard with the other dishes.  So he'd probably want to go to a place like a park.<n>So answer: A<n><n>Input: What is the volume of a tennis ball in cubic inches?<n>Output: Tennis balls have three, approximately spherical chambers and the outside is sealed with a small lid.

If there are twice as many red rocks than square rocks, then how many other red rocks are there?<n>Output: If you multiply the square factor 2, you'll get 2 times the number of red rocks 2 x 130 = 260, which isn't the same number.<n>Instead, we can add the number of red rocks to the number for the factor and we'll get the root of the square root 1. So, 130+1 = 131 131 is the largest number that can be divided by 2 to yield no remainder.<n><n>Input:  30 boys went to the school trip.<n>Then 3 times the number of boys went to a new town to visit their grandma.<n>Now 6 times the number of boys left with the 20 teachers to watch a football game.<n>Now 2 times the number stayed behind.<n>How many boys are left?<n>Output: There are 13 boys left, because there are 3 + 3x(number of boys) + 6x(number of boys)+ 2 = 33, so 33+2 = 35 then 35%2 = 13.5, the closest whole number is 13.<n><n>Input:  If I have 26 apples and 18 oranges, how many pairs of fruit do I have?<n>Output: if you have 26 appls and 18 orans, then if you subtract 18 from 26, you'll get the number of pairs. 26-18 = 8<n>Then you can multiply

He wants to see what the monthly cost will be for his employees  so he knows how much to get paid in order to get paid back by the end of the year.  There will be four employees during the summer and six during the fall semester who will drive the truck. He wants to know the total monthly cost and how much he needs to pay them.<n>Input: Mark will have 4 employees this summer and 6 employees during this semester.<n><n>4*150 =<<4*150=600>>600 miles with 6 employees this semester is 360 miles for the summer and fall combined<n><n>So in 360 miles mark will pay $1447.50/45$mile/$45 mile = <<1447.08/$45=32.1>>32.145 minutes per mile.<n><n>He should round up, leaving 1.982$.  He should multiply that times the number of miles and then multiply that times 1.98$ and that'll be the cost.  That's because each day has many hours, therefore 1.98 should mean the month is 1.98 months long.<n><n>Mark decided to multiply total miles driven by $1.982$ and got the correct answer: 600+360=<<600+30=940>>940 miles * 1.98 = <<1.98*940=1934>>1934 miles and 10340 cents<n><n>So, the cost to drive this truck should be  $10,34.00$ a month with his employees.<n><n>##### Question two:<n><n>Input: What is a fraction that is greater than 1?

Choices:  A: fearless B: english carrier C: courageous D: brave E: achromatic<n>Output:		 We have yellow and opposite.  Let's do a little bit of math to get this right.<n>Lets flip yellow, making A and B equivalent.<n>If we have D=A, then in terms of D, we have B=1/D A=1/D<n>We flip this: 1/A=B so D=1/B  So A and D are equivalent.<n>Now, lets subtract "A" from D:<n>1/D=A D=D/A<n>1/D=D/C  So D=D/C and A, B, D are 1,2,3<n>If this is the language or a language, the choices are: A=1, which is english, therefore B=2 and this carrier is called D=3.  C is "achromatic" and it is the opposite to all of those.<n>So D=3 is the answer.  Since letters are in sequence, we know (A to D) so we know that (E=D+1 because, all letters are in sequence and D is 3, so E is 4.  The opposite to the characteristics, courage, english and achromatic are:<n>Fearless, Brave, and Colorless, so the correct answer is C, Brave<n><n>### Instruption: Answer the following programming problems.<n><n>Input:  A triangle is created from two opposite sides and the midpoint of the third side.

Hockey:<n>- The shortest answer to our search for "Where are bleachers most likely at a hockey game?" was this: https://local.yahoo.com/info-22136245-best-bleachers-for-hockey-tickets-in-nashville<n><n>According to them, the bleachers are the shortest rows in the stadium so that means the shortest rows/bleachers in the stadium are at games.<n>2. Movies: <n>- According to "What are movie screen rows called?" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_screen#Rows_of_the_screen), a movie screen is called a'screen' and a screen is <n>built for projecting images.<n>- According to Wikipedia the movie screen is only referred to by its size, so we will assume that screens are the screens because they are the screens, but they also have rows (the images projected on the screens), therefore the shortest lines are the rows/bleachers.<n><n>So the shortest rows are at movies<n><n>3. Theater: <n>- A theater is a building with bleachers<n>- One article (https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/opinion/ct-ptb-northbrook-town-hall-theater-ct-0308-20180307-story.html) mentioned, "If you think theaters are bad for your hearing, wait till you get home after a night at a concert at the Taste of Chicago. I am not talking about the screaming fans behind you, but the noise from the stage equipment."<n>- This is why we think the best example for theaters are the rows/bleacher seats which are the shortest rows<n>4. Opera: <n>- If we search for "What is a row in an opera?" or "What is the shortest row in an opera?" there is no answer.<n>- We are not including opera in this because it is hard to find answers to the question.<n><n>5.

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.

Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n>Output:		<n>Pet stores sell and trade animals.  While John does not hate all animals, he doesn't like it when animals are owned.  If they are in a pet store, John will avoid going.<n>As an animal lover and a man who hates animal abuse, John would not want to go to a woodland.  There are no pets found in the woods.  There also may be alligators, skunks, snakes and even dangerous predators.  He would probably avoid woods too<n>John is a man who hates all animal abuse and he is definitely not fond of cruelty, so he would definitely avoid parking lots where pets are brought in and possibly injured.<n>Parking lots are known for many things, but animals are not one of them.  There are no animals, only pets that are in parking lots because either they are being brought in for sale or perhaps an owner is dropping them off.<n>The most obvious reason why John would avoid going to a north american country is for animals.  North america has so many different animals found within its borders.  John would not only avoid it, he would make sure to never go back.  While John doesn't hate every animal, he knows where many animals live and will not be there.

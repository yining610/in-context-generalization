{"text": "C\n\nInput: The bride and groom have to decide on a gift for the guests. They know that for each gift they offer, there are two possible costs, and so, to choose the appropriate gift, they divide their respective incomes by two. If the guests' gift is expensive, it will be considered to be good, and if the gift is cheap, it will be considered bad.  The guests will like one of the gifts at random.  When the bride decides whether to offer a gift in which she has equal shares with the guests or a gift with her income divided equally between them and a different guest (or all guests have the same amount from her), she gets a lottery ticket. Then, the couple decides on a rule, such that the guests' gift preferences are the expected reactions to the bride's gift-offering decision.  When they apply the rule correctly and make the correct decision, they win the lottery. If they make an incorrect decision, the guests will like some gift with probability equal to (bride's income/guest's income) and dislike the rest with probability (guest's income/bride's income).  How many lottery tickets do they have to buy if they want an equal chance of winning as in the example?\nOutput: 8\n\nInput:A bag has 23 red, 57 green, and 3 blue balls.A ball is randomly pulled from the bag, and its color is noted.

How many times as many quarters as Blake and Clem, together, have as Chloe and Jack have altogether?\nOutput:\n\n## Recommendation:\n- Create a working folder that contains all of your code and the test.\n- Write your main as a new method that is static and annotated as @Test. Main method does not need to be static, but it will be easier to call a static main on a separate file. You can override the main method, but be careful as you may not get the same results you want.\n- Include a description of the test in the main method.\n- This is a unit test, as such it should not be dependent on any external system (i.e. database).\n- The test classes will need to be in a separate package from the util classes and code, as stated in the instructions.\n- All methods must be annotated @Test.\n- Make sure to use the annotation @ExpectedMethodExecutionCount in any test class that utilizes other methods.\n- The input and output will be in strings, so you will need to use `Assertions.assertEquals` method or others that assert on the string value.\n- All tests shall be automated by using `@Test`.", "answer": "B: old people's home"}

If this condition is true, then add the number of room choices which has E as a substring to the number of room choices with A as a substring.\nYou want to repeat this step for 'B', 'C', and 'D', and finally, add them up to obtain the total number of room options.", "answer": "D: hat rack"}

When they die, they are completely covered in bugs and insects who eat their flesh and leave their body behind.\n          3.) Because of the climate of Egypt\n          4.) Because their bodies were buried in the desert for a very long time but then discovered.\n          5.) The mummies were buried in desert areas so the soil in the underground areas in which they were buried got drier until it was an ideal temperature for mummification\n          6.) The Egyptians wrapped their mummies in linen and then put them in cool, dark places in the desert in the hopes that their flesh would turn into linen and they would become immortal.\n          7.) The mummies of the Pharaohs were mummified in the underground tombs in an ancient city in the middle of the desert.\n          8.) Their bodies were placed in desert tombs in the hopes that their skin would fall off and they would turn into stone.\n          9.) The Egyptians believed that the sun\u2019s warmth would make the linen wrap the mummy so tight that the flesh would turn to stone and the body would be preserved forever.\n          10.) The Egyptians used a chemical called Niter, which was often found in the underground tomb, where they lived after they had died. A mummy is made mainly of the person\u2019s skin. The skin dries out and shrinks so that the person appears to be made out of stone.\n          11.) The 95% humidity in Egypt makes the moisture get inside of a body, causing it to be preserved forever.\nOutput:\n\n   1.)

So we have to find the difference of 2 lists of numbers and use integer division.\n\nInput:  \n66 + 18 + 5 + 2 = 91\n\n100 - 91 = 9\n\nI can do the same thing to another part of the problem.\n\nInput:\n\n100 + 14 + 10 + 6 = 130\n\n10 = 100 - 130\nHence the answer is 9.\n\n\n### Explantion of solution:\n\nI use integer division and subtract two lists of numbers to find the answer. My answer for this is 0.\n\nInput: Length: 2\nOutput: 0\n\n11 - 10 = 1\n\nThus, my answer for Part A, is 1. (Since I do integer division, if the list of numbers is shorter than the total of the lists the answer would be 0.)\n\n\nInput: Lenght: 3\nOutput: 0 \n\n18 - 16 = 2\n\nThus, the answer for Part A is 2\n\n\n### Reason:\n\nMy reasoning is that in the first part A, you have to do integer division because there is a \"1\" in the list of numbers so the answer would be 90/100 * 100 - the original number of hours.  I used a similar logic to the second part and did integer division to get the answer of 0.\n\n\n## Input: Freddy is calling family on New Year'S Eve.

A three-digit number which is the sum of the first two digits and of a single digit does not end in 2 or 6. A three-digital number is formed of a single digit and of two digits which are the sum of the first and the second in the original number.

The deck has Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Dealer, and Number cards numbered 1 through 10, for a total of 13 cards. At the end of each round, the total of cards chosen is kept. Once a round has ended, the total number of cards chosen is added to a running total. This continues until one player ends with a score of 13. All the players start with a score of 0 and will continue in that fashion if they cannot beat the total required to win.\n\nThis game is a variant of Rummy in which a player can either discard or draw a card. When drawing a card, the player can choose to either discard the card they draw or add it to their collection of chosen cards. Once a player draws, the current round ends and the next round begins. At the end of a round, each player must discard one of their chosen cards.\n\nWrite a program to determine whether or not a player can win a round.\n\n### Instructions:The following code is the complete logic of the game\n\nclass Deck:\n    def __init__(self, decks):\n        self.__cards = [i for i in range(13)]\n        self.__deck = self.__cards\n        for i in range(len(decks)):\n            self.__deck = decks[i].copy()\n            self.shuffle()\n    def isEmpty(self):\n        count = 0\n        for i in self.__cards:\n            if i in self.__cards and self.__cards.count(i) == 1:\n                count += 1", "answer": "B: container"}

There is an old, old man who lives in a small town on the shores of Lake Fayette, near the Florida coast.\n\nII. He lives alone in a small house with just enough land for a garden. Most of his family has passed away, and he is the sole survivor.\n\nIII. Every day he goes to a small shack just off the main road into town and waits for a train to come by.

The man's name is James, and while the town thinks he is quite senile, he isn't. And whenever he gets to looking at the cars on the train, he remembers.\n\nV. James remembers a day when he was a boy with his father, long before there were trains, and they drove in a carriage along the very road that he now stands along.\n\nIn his carriage, James was too young to truly know what was going on, or why his father was making such faces as he stared at the very same spot that James has been standing near ever since.\n\n\nVI. The carriage would come to a stop and James's father would get out and go to a rock on the side of the road. As James watched him curiously, his father would pick up a small stone and toss it through the air.\n\nHis father would then call out the name of several different animals that lived in the countryside. As he had done many, many times, James's father would watch carefully as the stone made its journey to the ground.\n\nVII. Every time a stone was chucked into the sky, his father would call out animal names. No, not a dog or a cat; not a rabbit or a deer. The names that his father called were much more strange. Like a porcupine or a rhinoceros, or even an armadillo.", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

For instance, I need to buy a new phone because my old one is running out of battery very fast. With a problem-solving skill, I decided to purchase a phone that has an extraordinary memory size and long standby life. The reason for my problem solving is so that I will not need to buy another phone in the near future.\n\n<b>`a`) How might the problem-solving step work in the above situation (refer to problem solving steps)? </b>\n\nIn this instance, I identified the problem, which is an inefficient and insufficient mobile battery. Next, I collected information by checking online reviews and talking to some of my relatives who have the brands that I previously owned. After this, I made a strategy to tackle the problem by purchasing a new mobile that has an excellent battery. Finally, I took action to address the problem. I am now using the phone.\n\n<b>\"b\") How will you handle a problem situation where you are not sure about the causes of the problem and their solutions?\"</b>\n\nIf I find myself in a situation where I do not know what is causing a problem, how it could be solved or what the solution may be, I will first try to think critically about what the problem is. I will also consider the options available and compare them one-by-one to determine which way to go. I will use all of my resources, such as books or friends, to learn more about the problem and its potential solutions.\n\n<b>() What did you learn from this activity?\"</b>\nAs you may know, a company may experience issues on several levels, often due to human error.

What are the base and number of sides equal to?\nOutput: 4, 5\n</br>\n\n# Solution:\n## Basic logic:\n1. We know the candies of Corey was more than those of Tapanga.\n2. If there were 66 candies altogether, then Tapanaga should have 18more than Corey.\n3. Tapanga should have more 18 candies.\n4. Therefore Corey should have 29 candies.\n\n## Instruction Analysis\nThe main purpose of this question is to allow us to think how to use 'how many' and 'how much' in a problem in a logical way, rather than by memorizing the rule. \n\n## Solutions:\n\n1. The total minutes of the calls. This is the easy one and the main question of this question. \n\n2. We can deduct the total hours of the calls. The answer would be 7.5 hours. However, the question is asking for the average of the hour he worked. We can just add up these two numbers and then divide by two because he did the same number of hours both days.\n\nThe total money spent for the calls. \n\n4. We can deduct a row with 30 minutes because he spent the same amount of money.\n\n\n5. \n\n6. We can determine the average temperature from the question as", "answer": "C: do work"}

In fact, they were easier than the tasks I had to solve in the first round. However, this round did require a little bit more critical thinking, as well as more detailed coding. I needed to carefully think about each question and then make sure I tested my code for the appropriate situations. As I started working on the task-based coding problems and algorithm problems, I realized that more of my focus was required. I had to make sure that I was focused on the question at hand or else I wasn't understanding the task and would make an error.\n\nFor this round I noticed that I didn't fully understand the task until I had already made an attempt to complete it. As I worked through the tasks and worked through code problems, I discovered it helped me to have a better comprehension of how to approach each task. Once I figured out the approach, I felt more confident about the task instead of feeling like I didn't have enough time to understand the problem.\n\n# Plan for the Next Round\n\nDuring this round, I noticed that in order to be successful, I need more problem-solving and time-management skills.

This was one of my first experiences with programming, back when I studied at university. I was going over my homework in a class, when I came across this algorithm that was supposed to count the number of times there is a * in a sentence. I tried to implement it with if statements, but I kept getting it wrong. Then I thought about doing it by trying to replace the word * * for a number, but I got frustrated that it was failing when the * was immediately followed by another * (ex: *). So instead, I used a stack (which you'll learn about later).\n\n\n## Instruction:\n\nThe final exercise in this chapter is to write a program that reads in sentences, and counts how many there are where there is a * at the end of it. For example, if the sentence was \"I don't want to * I'll do it\" there would be a total of 3 asterisks, because there would be one at the end of the sentence, and two asterisks where. Each line from your input file will be followed by a period.\n\nEach line will start with a sentence, and will end with the following \"\".\n\n## Instruction Continued:\n\nExample Input:\n\nI don't want do it.\nI love you.\n\nExample Output:\n\n4\n\nI don'tt*I did it.\nI likee you.\n\nExample Outout.\n\n3\n\nThe number of asterisks in your sentence will be returned as a single integer to the screen; each asterisk will count as 1.\n\n\n### Input: The program reads in the following lines of text. Each line starts with a sentence, and ends with \". I'll do it\". Each program runs, we read in and output the number of asteriscs that the program found.\n\nI don' t.* I did it.\n*\n\nExample Output:4\n\n### Instructions:\n\nFinally, we need to run our program many times on the same file, to make sure the program", "answer": "C: glee"}

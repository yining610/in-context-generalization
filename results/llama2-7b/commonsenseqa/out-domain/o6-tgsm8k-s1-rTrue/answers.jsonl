{"text": "If you were asked \"Where would you expect to see pizzerias when shopping?\" you may have answered \"in capital cities.\" If you did, you were right. If you chose either Chicago or Streets, you were still mostly right. Capital cities are where politicians are located and where many corporations have their headquarters. Many stores are located in these cities. So shoppers expect to see big stores, including grocery stores, in capital cities. Chicago, where the deep dish pizza originated, is called \"Chi\" for short. Chicago still has the highest number of pizza places of any U.S. city. So this answer could also be right. Chicago's nickname is \"The Windy City\" so the answer \"streets\" could also work. But you also might be thinking of the street vendors that sell pizza. Food courts are places where many kinds of vendors offer many choices at fair prices. So there is a good chance that you would find these food vendors in a capital city, especially one where many businesses are located. Finally, Little Italy is a section of New York that is named after the many Italian immigrants who lived there many years ago. Pizza originally came from Italy. So you might expect to find many pizza places in Little Italy. Another great place to locate pizza shops would likely be Food Courts, as many types of cuisine are common there, including Italian.\nThe correct answer is E\nWe are looking for a capital that also has a large number of pizza places. Chicago and Capital are the only incorrect responses because Chicago is a large city, but it does not have a large number of pizzerias. Also, capital is a type of city that includes the capital of the government and usually a large city. Little Italy and streets do not include any capital cities\nPizzerias have to be located somewhere, especially in the U.S. where pizza is the country's most popular food. So, many will be located in capital cities. These cities are also home to many corporations, so many stores will be there\n\nInput: What fraction of the number 15 is equal to 6?\n\nOutput: Since 15 is made up of 12, 3, and 2, we can rewrite the given fraction as 6/12.

The cars drive at the same rate for a distance of 25 kilometers. After the cars have driven this distance, the faster car has driven 50 more kilometers. How many more kilometers does the faster car still have to drive in order to travel the same distances that they both traveled to start? Choices: A: 0 km B: 2 km C: 6 km D: 12 km E: 18 km\nOutput: The cars drive the same distance in the same time, so the faster car is 3x faster.\nSo when the faster car is 25 + 50km faster than the slower car, the faster car covers 20 more km.\nSo now the faster car is 55+20=<<55+20>>75 km faster than the slower car.\nHis time is 3x(55+20)= <<3(55+21)=165>>165 faster than the slower car and the slower car is now 165km behind.\nIn order to drive the same distance, he needs to drive 165+125 = <<165+1,25=290>>290 km to the other car\nSo the answer is 290 km\n\nInput: The answer is D: 12.  Because 0 km+2 km+6 km+12 km+18 km=<<0+2+6+12+18>>32 km.  Then if the faster car drives 3 times faster than the slower car(3km/min) 3/32=<<3/32=0.09>>9.  Dividing that by 60, there are 9 minutes left for the faster car to drive.  The faster car needs to drive 9/60 = <<9/60=0.15>>15km.

It's about the number of dog owners who also own cats. There is a 39% chance someone will own only dogs, and a 61% chance they'll own both. So, of a sample that owns both dogs and cats, there's a 61/2 (0.305) probability they'll own only dogs (2/3 of the sample who own both own dogs), and a 39/2 (0.195) chance they own only cats (1/3 of the sample). So 39% of dog owners don't own cats and the other 61% do.\n39% of the sample (the total number of dog owners, that is) own cats. This is equal to 39% of 71% (the dog owners who both own dogs and cats), or.39*.71=.28 (the probability that a given dog owner also owns cats). 61% of the sample (or the total number of both dog and cat owning sampled individuals) don't own cents. Now, 61% of that total is 39%, which is the probability cats aren't owned by those dog owners, so 61%-39% = 22%. So 22% of the sample (a.k.a. 22% of those who own dogs and cats) doesn't also own cats. So the final answer is 71%", "answer": "D: carpenter's shop"}

The bus is already far from home because 300 (1,800 - 1,500) = <<300(1800-150)=300>>300 km.\nSo the answer is that the bus has traveled a total 300 km, so it needs to travel 1,50 - 300 = <<150-300=150>>150 more km.\nSo the final ans for this is 450.\n\nInput:Jenny needs to walk to her next class.

Lance is two years younger than Sam. In five years, Lance will be twice as old as Sam. Which of the following equations is used to solve for how old John is?\nOutput: The first equation to solve is -13 + 2 + 4 = age\nBut the second part of the equation is: Lance will be twice the age of Sam. \nFor Lance to be twice as old as sam, we need to look at this: 2*Lance = Sam\nSo 2Lance > Sam. We can simplify this equation to Lance > Sam.\nFor Lance to age by 2 years, he needs to subtract or decrease 2 from his current age.\nSo from the first equation: John age -13-3 = <2 years older than his age> and John age -13 -3+2 = <13+2=15 + 2 years> old.\nSo the final solution can be John age = 15+2 years.\n\nInput: When Sarah goes to the ice cream store, she buys a pint for herself and a scoop for a friend.

An applicant\n2. A third party who may have interacted with the applicant\n3. A professional (such as a lawyer) who has interacted with the applicants\nIf the reference contradicts something, it is either false or misleading. Therefore, it is not considered a positive reference.\n\n1. Is there a situation where a positive reference, despite being truthful and factual and not contradicting the applicant, would be sufficient to hire the applicant? If so, then A may be false and E may be true.\n2. Is there a situation in which a reference would be false (but not misleading) and not sufficient to fail an applicant? If so then E may be false and D may be true (the applicant would still be hired).\nSolution Explanation:\nReference is not a positive reference if:\n\n1. The reference contradicts the information given by the applicant.\n2. Relevant information is missing from their information.\n3. Something that is not relevant is given.\n4. The reference gives false information.\n\nThere are no two ways about it. A reference must be positive and there are no other options.

In order to have more than one valid positive reference, the applicant needs to have more than one reference.\n\nThe question asks about having more than one positive reference, which has a straightforward meaning. We know that we cannot have more than positive reference if we want to keep the consistency in the system in which a reference must be valid to confirm the applicant. The only exceptions are if we allow a reference to have other positive references or if we allow a reference that disagrees to confirm an applicant.\n\nIf we allow other positive references, then the applicant can choose the best positive reference to confirm them.", "answer": "C: deny"}

If the amount of dots on any of the dice is equal or less than the number of his counters, he removes a counter. Otherwise, he puts the dice back and it's the next player's turn. The last player who keeps all of his counters wins the game.  What are the chances to win, when you have no counters left? In other words what is the exact value of x, and the exact value of y in x=<<x=2>>2, y=<<y=9>>9?\nOutput: In the beginning of the game each player have 7 counters and after 3 players the game ends.\nThe x in the statement is the possibility that each player gets a counter. So the probability that the game is won is in the first try x/3.\nIf he loses, the probability that he will win the second and the third time are also x/3.\nSo the probability of winning on the first try = x/3(x/3).\nAnd in general, the probability of winning each game are x/3*x/3*x/4*(x/4)*(x/5)*(x/6)*(x/7) = y*<<y*123!>>, where x and y are as written in the statement.\nSo the final answe is 2 and 9.\n\nInput: How long does it take to get from A to B traveling at 35 miles/hour, and how long does it take to drive the same distance at 25 miles/hour?\nOutput: The final answer is 2 and 1.\n\nInput:  A: Choose the correct answer:\nThere are: a) 999 b) 99.9 C) 9.99 D) 0.995\nAnswer:\nA) the correct answer is 999.

But then the sentence says that the percent of people (or percent of survey respondents) was 42 percent in the last sentence.  So the percent must have stayed the same, not jumped from 50 to 42 percent.\n\nInput: You can answer this question with more than ONE answer choice.\n\nInput: 45% of survey respondents said that you should use a little or no salt, so 55% said you should NOT use a little or no amount of salt.  And you already said that 62% said you should use some, so that leaves 13% for some respondents saying they shouldn't use a little or no, which is also 45% which is one of the choices, so your answer is D.\n\nInput: Which of the following numbers are prime?

Choices:  A. 18 B.  17 C. 9 D.6\nOutput: 9, which is less than 17\nThe question is asking for the smallest number that goes into both 26 and 73. To begin we know the divisors of 26 are 1, 13, and 26 itself. Since 73 is larger than 26, 13 goes into 73 exactly once, leaving remainder 40, so 5/13 would be equivalent to 0.385.\nSo for 26, 0.38461538461 of 26 goes in, which is 0.38 of 26 goes into 26.\nSo for 73, we get 26/73 = 0.35353... and the remainder is 1/35 of 73, or 3/35. 1/35 can be converted to one over 35 by multiplying by 35. So we get the last answer of:\n\n\\(\\frac{5}{13}\\) = \\(\\frac{3}{35}\\).\nSo the final answer for this question is 3/35\n\nInput: Mary was walking 2 miles an hour.

After that, 29/5 = 5/2.  Since the divisor of each term is the same, we can subtract to get 29 - 5 = 24.  Then we subtract again to get 24 - 2 = 22.  The answer is 22.\nThe next step is to figure out what the divisor is.  We can divide the divisor by itself to get 5/2 (since 1 * 5 = 5 and 2/2 equals 1).  So dividing 29 in half is the same as dividing 5 in two.  When we subtract by 5, what we\u2019re actually doing is finding the product of what we were trying to divide.  This could be simpler to see by multiplying both sides by 60, which is 29/5 * 5/2.\n60 + 29 = 91\n\nOutput:  The next step uses the information in", "answer": "D: sporting goods store"}

For example, since 2^2-8=<<2^2-8==-6>>-6 which is odd, you have to subtract 3 from every power of 2.So if you have a power of 2 which is an even number, you subtract 2 from it. Like the sum of each term will always be odd.\nExample 8, it is not even so you don't have to subtract anything from it.\nExample 9, 9^2=81, which is even. So you have to subtract 2 from 81 to get 80 which is odd.\nExample10, 10^2=100, which is even. so you have to subtract 4 from 100 to get 96 which is odd.\nSo the final answe is 10\n\nInput: What is 9?\nOutput: 10 because for the number line, the first number is 0, the next is 1, the next is 2 and so on.

It was a good, but slightly depressing, reminder of our lack of family fun. After the meal, Mom wanted to take me out shopping so she could buy me a small token of my love. I felt guilty for not letting her take me shopping over the summer before I left for college. Therefore, at the counter, I told the cashier that I'd like to buy mom an expensive scarf which cost $50.

She figures that feeding her dog 114 cups \nof food will give him this number of calories. If her dog is slightly larger than \nnormal, what is the best estimate of how much calories his food should have?\nOutput:Mary uses 114 cuppers of food and gives her dog 25 food calories and 48 more for him to eat. We don't know how large her dog is, so for convenience's sake, we'll say her dog gobbles down the 114 cupper food and eats 48 more. We want to make sure Mary gives her dog as close to 255 calorie's as possible. Therefore, we would divide 255/114 and get 2.2. We divide the amount of calorie's by the amount of cupper's and we get a rounded approximate number of 2.2 calorie's per cupper of food.\nSo the final awnser is: '2.2'\n\nInput: There are 12 boys and 8 girls in a class.

{"text": "C: When playing cards (e.g., in a casino), it's illegal to know what you're going to get as the next card.  If you're cheating (by counting cards, for example), the dealer knows, and he may lose his job.  If you've won, the person who lost may decide that you must be cheating. ---------- The dealers deal the cards, so they can't have their own cards and try to count too... They will know if you're counting. So they cannot be involved in this illegal activity. The dealer in a casino cannot win money because they don't have cards or anything to play with. And they don't need to remember if they dealt all of them to all the people. And if they win, they are going to get fired for sure. The other players would call them cheaters, too. So they can't win money. So, the dealers are only allowed to deal cards. They cannot do anything else, including counting cards, remembering cards, dealing themselves anything, cheating, or helping others cheat. So, only the other players are allowed to do any of these activities. There are different activities that are prohibited in different casinos, but this is the main one.\n\nInput: What is the sum of the number of letters in the following words?

The artifacts during construction need to be preserved and are thus not usually recovered.\nThus the answer is choice C\n\nInput:There are a lot of cows in a field.  A cow eats 5 pounds of grass per day.  There are 102616 grass cows.  If the field is square shaped, then every day, the grass grows 6 pounds per square foot (sq ft) per month.  Each month the cows grow 28 sqft per cow.  In what month do the cows begin to shrink?\nOutput: To start, a cow eats 5 lb grass a day so 1026,16 cow * 5 lb = <<10261105>> 5,040,850 lbs\nEvery month the grass grows 28 sq ft and the cow grows 28 sqft so the cow would grow 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>> 56 sq ft\nBy doing 1026*5*56 = 2.86 million sqft\nIf x% of the grass is eaten, then 2.86*6/100/x =2.61 pounds\nSo x has to be less or equal to 6/70 = <<6/70=8.57>>8.57%\nAfter 57% of the grass is gone for the cows, they start to shink", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

A number is composite if it has more than 2 factors.\n\nHow many 3-digit numbers divisible by 6 are there?\nOutput: A 3-digit number is divisible by 6 if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, or 6 (as in 6, 12, 18, or 24).\nSo there are 16 3-digit numbers that are divisible by 6.\nSo the final number is 16\n\nInput:  If you multiply or divide by 4, the digits of the answer will always be the same as in the number.  If you subtract, the result has always the digits as in 537.  If you add, the answer always has digits as in 744. Which two digits of a certain odd number make the first three digits different if you multiply it by 189, subtract it from 988 and add it to 217?\nOutput: If you multiply 537 by 189 the digits are 13,34,56, 77 (which is the answer).

Choices:  C: elocutionist E: orator B: polemicist A: orator E: elocutionist\nOutput:\nA person who knows how to speak well or easily before a large crowd is called an _elocutionist_.\nIt's not the only orator, because an orator is someone who delivers a speech in front of a group.  Orators are also called speakers.  This person knows how to speak to a group of people, but not in front of them.\nA _polemicist_ is a person who argues or argues to gain an advantage in a dispute.\nA _rhetoric_ is a person who uses language effectively to persuade. This means they know how to speak using persuasive language, but not necessarily before a large group.\nInput:Choose one of the statements:  A: All humans do not have a sense of time while sleeping.  B: People cannot tell the time during REM sleep.\nOutput:The most likely reason to wake up a sleeping person is a dream.  In most instances, people who are having a dream wake up for no reason.\nThey may wake up because the alarm went off. Another reason they may wake up is because of a noise that woke them up.  However, most of the time, people only wake up when they feel uncomfortable or need to use the bathroom.  Also, if there are multiple sleepers in one bed, one person may get kicked in their sleep and wake up without realizing they're still in bed.\nHowever, there may be a little bit more of an alarm if it's more than just one person.

Now that the boxes were on the table, though, I had some extra space under the table for the papers that had been stacked on top of the boxes. I realized that my classroom was set up such that I could set a box on the floor anywhere in my room and then set another box on top of the first one, as long as I had plenty of room for my legs. So I grabbed four more boxes from under the table and then carried them four separate times to the table for each box, with four different paths total. When all the boxes were sitting on the table, I did the same task but used six more boxes I had under the other shelves in my classroom.\nI had 10 boxes on the table after I finished both tasks.  In each task, I set the boxes on the table one at a time and then I put the box I had just set on the table into another box under the table. So, for example, in the first task, putting the first box on the table, I put the first box in the box under the table that I'd just set on the table. And, in the second task, I put the 4th box on the table into the 7th box in the first task that I had set under the table.\nWhat was the last box to touch the floor?\nOutput: In the first task, the first box was put into the fifth box placed under the table. Then the eighth box was put into the ninth box placed under the table, and so on. So, once the last box was put in place, it was in the ninth box under the table.

Next, the question reads \u201cthe difference in their (Hurley and Richard\u2019s) ages is 20\u201d, so we can substitute in a \u2013 h for a. Now we have a\u2019s value and h\u2019s value, which is n \u2013 (60 + 20) = n \u2013 80 (80 is the difference in their ages). n \u2013 80 = n \u2013 82 (because (60 + 80) = 140) So n = 82 + 120 = 202. Now we can subtract the difference: a \u2013 h = a \u2013 20 \u2013 (a\u2019 \u2013 h\u2019) = a\u2019 \u2013 20\u2019 Now we have a\u2019 \u2013 21 = h\u2019\u2019, which is the same thing as h\u2019\u2019 \u2013 20, which is the same as n\u2019 \u2013", "answer": "C: united states"}

Amy and John have always planned to move away, but now they\u2019re stuck. They want to move the house North by 10 feet and level it off, to face West.

{"text": "C (A)\n\n### Explaination\n1. There are 20 years from now, Richard's 50+ and Hurley's 6. So the difference in age is 6+50=56. Thus the combined ages are 56+40=96\n1. He read 150 pages in each book. The cost of the books is $1500, so he spent $150 per book. He was left with $15 after buying $165 worth of candy. Thus the total cost for books is 165. So with 1650 pages in each, the total number of books is 10.\n1. The car wash had $500 and they had 4 people to split the cost. They also bought $15 of candy for $15 altogether. Since they had 4 people, 15 divided by 4, the amount each person had left was $3, meaning one person had to pay the extra $3\n1. Each friend had to pay $40 now with one less friend\n1. They bought the car for $70 with 20 cents/page remaining to each friend. Each friend had $3 in leftover cash. Thus each friend would pay 20 cents plus $3, giving them a new cost of $3.10. The cost goes up $0.10\n1. 5 eggs/cake with 7 cakes\n1. 5/7 of the money\n1.

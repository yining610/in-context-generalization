When cooling a room, the cooler outside temperature means less heat must be removed from the room inside to lower the room's temperature. Thus the cooling is more energy efficient. When heating a room, the warmer outside temperature means less heat needs to be added to the room in order to raise the room's temperature, which also makes the heating more energy efficient. For every 1 degrees C increase (change) in outside temperature, what is the change in the room inside temperature? Choices:  -4 C, -10 C, -20 C,+1 C, +20 C.\nOutput: The correct answer is for every 1 degrees C Increase in outside temperature, the decrease in room inside temperature by 0.1667 degrees.

The temperature change for every kilometer, T=(1+x/2-x)^2*x=((1+sqrt(5))/2)x^2T=(1+sqrt(5)/2)x^(2)\nYou can now plug the measured distance from sea level into the formula x=2000/((1+sqrt(2000))/2)=2000/sqrt(4000)x=(2000/2000)/sqrt(2004)  where ((1+sqrt(5/2))/2=sqrt(6)\nSo x=200 meters, and so your formula for T is to plug in T=(1+sqrt(6))x^2T=(sqrt(6))x^(2) into the formula for temperature. And you get T=(1.685)x^2\nFor a 1900 meter difference in elevation, you get ~ x=20 meters away, so plugging in x=20, we get T\u224830,134C\nYou may round it down\nSo the final answer for 30000 feet of elevation, you get a drop of around 0.05degC\n\nInput: How would you describe someone who has an excessive need to show that they are better than others?

How long will an infant titi need to live there in order to have a 50% chance of having survived?\nOutput: We see that titi seeds take two years to grow.  They mature after 2 more years.  And at age 4 they are fully matured.  So at age one they will be 0.5 years old.\nBetween ages 1 and 2 is 10% of 36=<<36=4>>4 years.  Since a child needs to live for 15 years to have a 5/6 chance of surviving, then in order to have a child live for 15+4=<<15+4=19>>19 years, they need to live 19-4=<<19-4=15>>15 years between ages one and two.\nFrom ages 2 to 3 is 4/36 in days, or 1/9 in years (1/129).

Choices:  B: Grocery bag C: Farmer's market D: Bushel basket\nOutput:\n\n#### Solution:\nThe answer from questions A), B), C) and D) is a number, but not any number, just a number that matches the corresponding text.  There is a special number that is the answer and is either the only one or the only one that is unique among the possible answers.  \nFor example for question A), the answer is 137, which is the only number that is both 2 and at least as large as 3.  In my interpretation of the question, if the number you use is too small, you won't be able to carry the potatoes, while if the number you use if too large, you wouldn't fit or be able to maneuver with the potatoes.  Thus 137 is the answer because it matches the text description of potatoes carrying the right amount.  I can explain that further if you wish.\n\nFor example for question b), the answer is 89.  If you think about it, you could choose $0, which would be impossible because the answer is a number, so it needs to be positive.

On the way there, it was a 70% chance that I could have a 50% chance to get a flu vaccine due to having a 24% chance of catching the flu.  I got into work, and it was Wednesday, so I called into work, which was an 80% chance that I would not have to go in because of my terrible attitude.  However, when I got home that evening, my wife yelled at me for leaving work early. How many days out of the week was I able to skip out on work?\nOutput: The flu vaccine protects up to 67% of people\n24%*67%=$<<24*67>>39%\nWhich means there is a 39% chance he becomes ill\nThe cost of the flu vaccine is $299 for one person.\nThe cost of missing work a month ($10.80 per hour*60 days)\n+ cost of missing work for three days $10.80*3=$<<10.8*3=32.4>>32.4\n+ cost of missing one work day after flu $10.8*1=$<<10.1*1>>10.8\nSo the total cost would be $==32.4+10.8=43.2>>-43.20+10.80=-54.00\nSo the final and incorrect answer is -54\n\nInput:A friend of mine left his iPhone 7 at my house to pick up in a couple of weeks.

This means that the number 1 would result in subtracting 50% leaving you with 0,  which we know is False.  Also, all of the possible answers from 5 to 19 would give a negative so they are also False.\nIn interval 6 to 7, the rule states that we subtract 50% which can be interpreted as 50%*.5=<<50*0.5=25>>25.", "answer": "B: research laboratory"}

A random sample of 30 people is taken and 25 of them vote for Party A.  The rest 5 of them vote for party B.  How many people voted for party B in Town A?\nOutput: To answer this we need to know the fraction of people that voted against part A. That would be 1 - 47/100=<<1-47/10=3>>3. So that means 53% of the remaining 57% of people (1-3) voted against party A (1-47/57=<<1- 47/57> =   8>>8)\nSo we have 53 * 57/100-<<53*57/10=57>>57 people that voted against party A and 47 * 43/100=<47*43/10=  1>>1 people that voted for party.\nThat answers this multiple choice question!\n\nInput: A random sample of 4 adults reveals that 90% of all the adults in India have cell phones.

One time after washing my clothes, I forgot to reorder detergent and I did my laundry with shampoo twice.  If laundry detergents cost $2.5 per bottle, then how much was the detergent I really paid for?\nOutput: $21 is 16*2.5=<<16*2.4=38>>38 ounces of dish soap\nThat means I paid 38*2+21=<<38*2+18.2>>36.2(This round to the nearest whole number)\nSo I really paid $36.2 for 16*2+21/2.5=<<30*2+45/2.5=33>>33 ounces of dishes soap\nSo what I paid is 33*2.5= <<33*2.4=82>>82 ounces of dishing soap\nSo the final answer can be rounded to the nearest whole number\nSo the final answer that you can round is 82\n\nInput: Peter's favorite kind of apples has always been Gala apples.

{"text": "Finding a better job is one way to make more money than you currently earn, but there are others as well. Saving money and investing it wisely can allow you to gradually build a nest egg over time so you will be able to meet your financial goals without having to rely on what you currently make as an employee.\nYou may also try your luck occasionally with the lottery, but most people aren't lucky enough to win the jackpots regularly. When you save money in a savings account, the interest you earn can help you earn even more money, growing your assets. You can start with as little as $100 initially, setting up a checking or a savings account depending on your objectives.\nAs well, you can improve the terms of your job in order to increase your earnings. This can include negotiating a raise or requesting a promotion.\nSo the final option is A\n\nInput: You have an opportunity to double your money.  You have to roll a 6-sided die to win.  If you roll a 6, you succeed.  Do you take the opportunity?\nOutput:The outcome depends on the odds of success. If you have a 3-in-6 chance of success, the expected value is 3/6 = <<3/6=1/2>>1/2, even though you would not lose all of the money. So you would say no because it's only 50/50.\nSo the final outcome is NO\n\nInput: At the age of 25, you will have $30,000 in your retirement account, if you save $1,50,000, then you will have $50,00 by how much years?\nOutput:In this scenario, if the person saves $150,00, they'll be able to retire at age 55. This assumes that the money is invested and earns an average annual return of 8.5%.\nSo the final answer here is 55", "answer": "B: better job"}

Is the amount of air resistance they meet while flying or bouncing affected by the age of the ball or the temperature outside? Explain your answer.\nOutput:Air resistance increases with temperature, so the temperature outside would affect how much air resistance the ball or plane incurs while bouncing or flying.\nSo the final choice is D.\n\nInput:The surface area of a cube and the surface area of the circumscribed cylinder of equal volume, has how many sides?\nOutput: A cylinder has 6 sides\nSo the final choice would be B\n\nInput:What is the difference between the amount of work done multiplied by a force and energy?\nOutput:The amount of work (done by a force) is the product of force and displacement (distance moved). (For example, the more a force moves the object, the more work is done. This is why if there is a 40 lb. force lifting a 10 lb. object, it will do much more work than if the force lifts a 20 lb. object. Similarly, when the 40 lb. forces lifts the 20 lb object, it will not do as much work because the force only lifts the object so much.)\nEnergy is defined as the amount of work done on an object over time. (Energy is also conserved in nature, so the amount of energy is always constant, and the amount of work done over time never changes.)\nSo the final answer, based on the last sentence, is H.\n\nInput:What would be a good thing to name a type of food that doesn't contain any fat or sugar?\nOutput:For a thing or type of food, a good name may include the qualities about the food that make it good for a person to eat.\nSo the final, would be B.\n\nInput:How do you find the area of a triangle?\nOutput: You add the lengths of the sides of the triangle and divide the answer by 2.\nSo the final outcome answer is A.\n\nInput: The formula for finding the surface area of a cone is as follows", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

{"text": "In this question, C has been chosen. The cooking pot was impeding the crab when it was walking.\n\n\n### Explanation:\nIn this question, all we need to know is 'how much did his purchases costs'.\nSince 'how much did he purchases cost' is a mathematical problem with known inputs and a known answer, a simple mathematical model is just enough.\nFor the mathematical expression of the problem, we first need to determine the known inputs, including 2.5*12 and 12*3.\nWe know $12*3 = 36$. $12 = 12$ thus $12*3 must be positive.\nIf you are going to ask what is 2.5*8, it is as simple as $2.5*8 = 20$. Thus the 'known inputs' are:\n1.12*3=<<36>>\n2.12*0.5=20.\nSo the mathematical expression of the unknown is $??x(12*3)+20=??$\nSo we can simply divide $56$ by $36$ and the final answer is $0.5+0.25$.\n\nThis question requires us to understand the meaning of'spends' given in the inputs.'spends' is the total time a player takes to perform the action, whether or not it is an action that needs cardio.\n\nTo make use of the correct solution model we need to understand the meaning of the inputs. The total time'spends' is 60 minutes because he has to perform 3 actions per day. The total time spent 'cardio' is 15 minutes because it takes 15 minutes to warm up, to do cardio, and to cool down.\nWe have 2 known inputs: \n1) 60 minutes in total(each day)\n2) 15 minutes to do cardio per day.\nWe don't have information for how long he does each of the 3 activities. Thus we have 60-24 minutes = 36 minutes for each activity.\nThus he has to do 1 activity for 36 minutes per day, do another activity for 36 more minutes per day, and yet do one more activity for 36 even more minutes, for a total", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

He is trying to match any toothbrush he picks with one of the balls in his suitcase, but he can only match a toothbrush with a matching ball. The only requirements are: Each ball must have a matching toothbrush. There are no more than two matches of any toothbrush. What would be the best chance of Adam finding a toothbrush to match one of his balls?\nOutput: Adam's first choice: If Adam chose the green toothbrush, he would have 3/5=.<<60/7>>60% chance of matching a ball. So he could match 1/7 of the balls on his first try.\nNext choice: If Adam chose a red toothbrush, then his chance of matching 2/5=.<<30/7>>30% chance of matching 2 of the balls. And a blue toothbrush: 4/5=.<<80/7>>80% chance of matching one ball.\nSo the final number of successes is the sum of success rate of the first choice + success rate of the second choice + success rate of third choice.\n\nInput:How much is two-thirds of 60?\nOutput: Two thirds of 60 is 2/3 * 60=<<60*2/3=30>>35.", "answer": "A: tennessee"}

{"text": "The student went to the store.\n\n```\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below.\n\nWhat does \tthe program do? It calculates the profit of a company from a given amount of money and a percentage of the profit. For example, if the company received 10000 dollars and made 50% of 1000 dollars then the profit makes 5000 dollars(0.5*1000=5000 dollars). This sum is equal to 500(5% of 10,000 dollars). The only thing the program could not do is the multiplication and division of the variables but nothing more.\nWhich variable should you change to have the program do something entirely different? There are two different variables - the variables that represent the amount of profit and the percentage of the profit. If you change those variable values, the program will output a different profit if you change them.\nWhich variable is used most frequently? It's \"amount_of_money\" or \"amount_of_sold_stuff\".\nWhat variables need to change to get the same output twice? Every variable in this program is needed to get same output twice. If you change any of this variables, the output will be different.\nIs there an input that requires special processing? There are no special process required. For example, I don't need to parse the input and change something. I can just write it like this \n\n```\nimport time\nfrom statistics import mean\n\nprint(\"This program calculates the profit of an unkown company!\")\nprint(\"Give me the amount of money you have and the percentage of the total profit that you have, and I'll tell you the profit of your company!\")\nt = input(\"I am ready. Give me the amount of money: \")\np = float(input(\"And the percentage of the total: \"))\nprint(\"You have \", t,\" dollars. The percentage of the profit that you earned is:\", p,\"%. You profit is:\", p * t, \"$.\")\nprint(\"This sum is equal to \", t * p, \"$.\")\n```\n\nWhat was hard about doing this? Sometimes, it was hard to find out some details about how this program works. Sometimes, I was looking for something where it is not placed. It's like when", "answer": "A: store"}

Each pens but the least expensive one costs 10 cents more than the average price.  We know that the most expensive pen costs the same as the least expensive, but that it costs 10 cense above the average price.  Therefore, it costs 110 cents more, or $1.37 more than $1.37+110=$<<1.37+<110>>127\nSo the price for the most expensive pen is $127.\nThat means the price for each other pen is the average price of the $127 price for the most expensive the price for each other pens is $127 -$1.37, or $125.63.\nThe total cost for all the pens = 20 * $125.4=1500.

I also have $10 in cash and 2 bottles of water.\nHow many more oranges would I like to buy more than 2 strawberrries?\nOutput: I would like to buy 4 more oranges, 4*0.5=<<4*0.5>2>>2, 4(1/2)=<<4(1/2}>=2>>2, 2(1/5)=<<2(1/5}>>1>>1, 2/5=<<2/5}>05>>0.\n\nInput: If there are 5 men and 3 women in a party, what is the chance that there is no man who has not been to a party with at least 2 other men?\nOutput: To solve this problem, we can assume that a man is going to a party with another man if that man did not go to a party with atleast 2 other men. Since there is only 3 women and 5 men, the maximum of men that a man can go to party with is 3 because there are 3 remaining men and 5 total men. So the chance that a man did not go to party with atleast $2$ other men is $5-3$. So it means there is $5-3$ = <<5-3>>2 possibility that there is no man to a party with at lease 2 other man.\n\n\n# Different versions:\n- 1 version of input:\n\nAlong what feature will find a rose bush?

So it's pretty simple.\n\nWhen we use recursion, it takes a couple time for the computer to execute the function that we write, so we'll have a different time with each different input. As we are doing some mathematical operation, the time that the computer will take to execute the function may be different, and sometimes it causes an error. `Time Limit Exceeded`", "answer": "B: large room"}

The salary of a person is: Salary = (1+Age)*1000, where he is paid 1000$ when he is young.  When he is older and has a big family to support, he earns more.\nOutput: When he is young, then his salary is 1000/0=$<<1000/1=1>>2\nHe is paid a lot initially according to the formula above.\nThen his salary is 2*Age. If he lives for 70 years, 70->2=35\nSo his salary is 35*1000\nAfter he turns 35, he earns more money according to the formula since he is older and has more expenses. So after being a man for 35 years, he will earn more money which is 35*2*1000=$<<35*2000=7000>>7000\nAccording to the formula, his next yearly salary is 7000*0.96, 7000/.96->122,176\nSo the final answer 7000+122176=$<<7000+300000=307000>>377000\n\nInput: A person is asked if he can lift a certain object.

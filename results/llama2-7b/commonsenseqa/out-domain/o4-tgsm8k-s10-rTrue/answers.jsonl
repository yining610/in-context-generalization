The stack-memory allocator supports 2 classes: MemoryAllocator and MemoryBlock. These classes can be instantiated via the allocator. Allocators support 2 operations: alloc and free. The alloc operation allocates a block of size n, and returns it to caller. The free op, frees an allocated block of size n. A block is released when you free it.\n\nThe block size must be a multiple of the byte width of pointer. For instance, if the pointer width is 32, a block size 10 must evenly divide 32. For the following code segment, the size of block = 128, for example, 128/4 = <<=32>>32 is not allowed.\n\nYour implementation should support all these functionality and not do any allocation after the memory is exhausted.

Given in percent, what is the minimum proportion of the total population staying home? (i.e. If half the population goes away, what is the minimum rate of the other half?)\n\n### Response\uff1a\nWhat part of this question is unclear? I don't understand.\n\n### Answer\uff1a\nThe population size is 10 million\n\nLet's say 50% of the population goes on a trip and the other 50% stays home.\n\nTherefore, (1-0.9) * 9% = 81.1% stay home\n\nTherefore, 10/2 * 81.1 = 40.55% stay home\n\n### Input : A country has a population of 200 million of which 40 million are students, of these 70% study in the city where they were born and 30% go abroad.

Let's ignore the number of students that stay at home for simplicity.\n\nTherefore number of students studying in their hometowns is 40 - 30/100 * 40 = 20\n\nTherefore the number of students that go to their hometowns = 40 - 20 = 20.\n\nLet's also ignore the number of student at home to stay simple.\n\nThe number of student that go abroad from the school is 70% * 40 =30\n\nTherefore\n\n70*4", "answer": "C: marriage"}

When grilling meat, marinate it with salt, pepper, and olive oil. The meat can then be grilled on charcoal (or on a gas grill) in less than 20 minutes. After cooking, the meat needs to be rested so that the flavor sinks into the meat. Restaurants typically have a resting time of 5 to 8 minutes depending on the size of the piece of meat.\n    - While grilling meat (or any other food), the griller can also toast bread or toast any other food item (e.g., bruschetta) by placing it on the surface of the grill that is directly underneath the meat.\n    - For meals like steaks, grilling is the best option since it gives the steak an almost smoky flavor.\n    - Grilled food tastes better than food that has been cooked in the oven or over a stovetop.\n- Add any relevant details from lecture or readings if you did not use them in your answer.\n- Provide references to lecture materials and/or readings.\n    Add a link to the lecture topic.\n    Add a source citation.

Do you think it will improve my game?\n\n### Response\nNo.\n\n### Rationale\n\n### Demolition of choice: The improvement in athletic performance from a period of rest and sleep\nAfter a long day of playing tennis at school for an hour, there is a long 30-minute rest period. After this rest period, there is a further 30-minutes of tennis play. The total number of minutes that Toni had to play tennis this way is 40*.2=<<40*.2=8>>8.\nAfter each tennis game, there needs to be a rest period of 30 minutes. Every resting period, the game must be repeated with another 30 minutes of play. This means that if the game lasts 4 days, you will need to play 4 tennis games within the 3 days. The total number of tennis playing time needed is 40*4=<<40*4=160>>160.\nSo if you play tennis every other day, you will need to rest for 3 times the amount of time compared to how much you actually play tennis.\n\n## Part 4\n### Input\nHow do I check my balance?\n####\nAnswer:-D\n\n### Demonic:\nTo check your balance you need to ask", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

We have customer service reps that will respond when a Smart Assist request is raised.  This can occur either by email or by SMS.\n\nWe think that Smart Assist offers several benefits.  It allows customers to respond when it's better suited for them.  If they are on a job and receiving a customer call distracts them, then the system can take care of it.  If they cannot respond by phone, but can respond to a text, and email, then the assistance can be given using Smart Assist.\n\nThe other benefit is the ability to respond to a single item.  If a customer call comes in to ask about one aspect of their service, then this feature allows customers to respond to just that question.  The customer saves time as there is no hold while waiting for other information to be requested.  The customer service call center saves time and costs as they have fewer calls to make.\n\nThe Smart Assist feature is not yet released for public use, but we do have a demo that you can play with to get comfortable with it.

For each of two leagues, he created two leagues, one with 16 fighters and one with 20 fighters. If there is an uproar in the boxing community, do you think the boxing promoter should continue to operate two leagues?\n\n### Response\nYES\n\n### Demand\n\n### Input \n\nBecause the boxing promoter has to compete with the biggest league in the world, which has a budget of $200 million, the money from the box would be divided amongst 5 leagues which compete for the same prize, making the chances of winning less likely. The smaller leagues, however, each have a budget of 500 million, meaning that despite the odds being against them, each is far more likely to win than they are in the bigger leagues.\n\n### Response \n\nNO\n\n### Supporting Ideas\n\n### Input The two leagues were split up into two groups: a small group and a large group.  The small group had 16 boxers, whereas the large group had 50 boxers.  Given the same budget, should the boxing promoter continue to operate 2 leagues?\n### Resp: YES\n\n### Support \nThe boxing promotor is the owner of the smallest league.  He can have a maximum of 50 players, however, there are more than the 50 boxes, which means that there will be more  people in which the winner will be randomly selected.\nIf you play in the smaller teams, your risk will be higher, so you dont have to risk it. \nThe best thing is to play at a larger boxing event where many fighters compete for the same box.\n\n### Input A: A small group competed with a large group in a boxing tournament.  Which group of boxers won more matches: the small or the large group?\n### Res: SMALL\n\n### Rationales:  This is because of the difference in the number of fighters in each division.

The choices that were given are: Race Track, Kentucky Derby and Triple crown.  The right choice is \u201cC.\u201d  If you think about it the only other options that are not Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown are Race Track and American Southwest.  Because the big crowds always follow Kentucky Derby and Triple, the race track is out of the equation and that leaves American Southwest.  This does not make sense because the American Southwest is not a horse race event it is a football game.\n\n### Next Steps: \nTo determine if a horse race track is a place that is associated with crowds, think about how many people attend the Kentucky Derby and Triple.  It should be your next choice, because it is the biggest event associated with a horse track. However if you think about it, any sporting event does not have to be connected to a race track with crowds.  Football and basketball is played on race tracks as well.  That leaves you with American Southwest.  In general if you don't know anything about an event but you know that it requires people to gather together, then it\u2019s a pretty close guess.\n\n###", "answer": "B: kentucky derby"}

Let me show you in the following simple way: the lead pencils we often use are mostly composed of these four materials: graphite blocks, wood cases, clay cores and wooden sleeves. After putting these four materials into the wooden sleeve first, they are connected in the middle to form a column of lead pencil. The upper part of the outer wood shell is an air pocket that can absorb our exhaled air. In order to write the words more steadily, we need to have a suitable pencil grip when we operate this air pocket. If we use too much force and force the lead pencil to be too thin, the lead pencil will easily break.\n\nWhen we look at the above description, we find that the lead pencil is composed of four materials that are connected by a certain principle, and the above method is used to lead and paint the paintings.

There are many online math tests, and many math workbooks designed to help kids improve. I have never found another study system that was like the Tests that was completely free and allowed so much freedom of improvement. The only drawback of the Tests is their limited topic coverage, but with the Testimonials, they show you every math subject and the Top Math Pages list many free sources to learn every topic. So if you find a Test that does not have a subject that you need, then you can try one of the sources to learn it and take the Test again.\n\n### The Tests are great, they offer kids a chance to test their knowledge and see where they're at!

Answer: B\n\n### Instructions:Complete the table. The data was obtained from an experiment done by a researcher where 60 participants were randomly assigned one of these three sleeping patterns: 1) six hours between waking up and going to bed. 2) one hour between going to bed and waking up. 3) three hours between waking up to going to bed.

If there is any remainder we continue to subtracting 1. We will never stop like this till we have a remainder less than 3 when we will finally stop. Thus to finally get 56 if we add 3 to the previous cell we get the cell 29 and subtracting one from it, we will get the 100 cells in between.\n- 86:\nThe same way we did it before.

For those that choose answer A (in river), I will have to say it doesn't sound like they are happy to take the car and that I think this person might be trying to sabotage the car and that the car might have better luck not with them behind the wheel. For those that like to park their car in answer D (in the neighbors driveway), they are definitely trying to make it look like they do not want to take responsibility for the car anymore. If they do not like the city, they shouldn't live in the city. For people that love to drive their own cars and take it their own pace in answer D (parking lot), that is awesome but it isn't for me. For those that like the parking lot, there is probably a good chance they have a parking lot near their house and they would prefer not to be bothered by all the people in a car driving.

We know 50 students are in the class and 50*(0.5)=<<50*(0.3)=15>>15 are boys and for 15 more we have to subtract the already given 15, leaving 35. So out of the 35 we have to subtract 0.5.

{"text": "Please make only one choice among the list provided.\n\n### Input\n\n> John is on an excursion with his class. They are learning about the wonders of the world. During the excursion, the group visits the Great Wall. At this wall, they take the option to ride a bike through the area. However, the terrain is rough and riding through the Great Wall seems like a good idea.\n>\n> As the group gets ready to begin, they get a brief speech from their guide before setting off. He informs them that 30 percent of people hurting themselves when they begin riding bikes, and that the average hurting person is only on a ride for 30 minutes. They each get thirty minutes with a bike. They then head out. John rides for 100 minutes, so it seems unlikely that the injuries occurred during this ride. How many injuries did John cause over three trips?\n\n### Answer\n\n> A total of seven injuries were caused.\n\n### The first 65 minutes were spent in the bike area. That\u2019s around 1.5 hours, meaning that there was at least 5 hours spent walking around in the Great Wall.\n### The class started at the beginning and left. It was a pretty long trip, so they had to take a long detour around for the bike area. It took 40 minutes and the last 6 hours were spent walking around in the bike area only.\n\n### Rationale\n\nIt seems like the first 65 minutes and last 6 hours were probably walking and the rest were bike.\n\nSo the total time John spent bike riding was around 105 minutes, and 105/30 = 3.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time spent in the bike riding area was 5.5 hours.", "answer": "E: falling down"}

Therefore, you can think of a reasonable answer.\n\nAfter that, try to confirm it from the answer (Answer)\n\nTo confirm the answer, you should try to eliminate some wrong answer from the first 2 rounds.\n\nIn this example, the third answer seems the most rational because you think that if the answer was B, I don't see how you should go to the third floor to Detroit.\n \n### What're the problems that you face?\nEven if you got the method to find answer, You may face 1 or 2 problems while finding the answer\n\n-  You are too attached to an answer too soon. You just jump into an answer, without considering the rationales you knew before\n-  You think that a wrong answer are easy to eliminate, but it's not simple\n\n\n## Difficulty in finding an answer\n\n\n### 1.  Your confidence too low.\nTo be able to find an answer, you should increase the confidence in yourself. You should learn to eliminate the answer you're attached to with rationales instead of relying on instinct.\n\n### 2.  Your level is too high.\nIf you find the solution is too difficult, You should choose the next level and learn about it slowly.\n\n### Level 2:  I think this is a multiple choice question, but it's actually a question about logical reasoning\nWhile you confirm a multiple choice question, You'd better confirm it's a logical reasoning question.\n\nYou can't find the answer unless you confirm it correctly.

They will be distributing 200 sample cans of their new product across six grocery stores in their area. They would like to distribute an even number of cans in each store. What is the minimum number of cans they could distribute in order to do that?\n\n### Response :The minimum number of cans the company can distribute is 40.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nLet's say that there will be a total of 200 cans distributed across six stores. We will need to distribute an even quantity of cans across each store, so we will take all the cans that will be distributed and divide them by six, which results in 37 per store. Therefore, since 37 + cans per store will be even, we only have to find the minimum number of can s distributed across all six stores so that the total is less than or equal to 200, therefore, we distribute 40 cans across all six stores\n#### 37,6,0,40\nAnswer:\n37,6\n\n### Input:[A person wears only white clothing during the week.

The domestic sheep only accounts for two species of the Ovis genus. This is similar to how the species within the genus Homo only comprise two different species. If the genus Ovis is abbreviated to O. and the genus Homo is abbreviated to H. what abbreviation should two species from a single genus receive? \nRationales: There are over 50 species on the domestic, so two species from over 500 means there are only 501-500=<501-5>5 species left. In the Ovis genus, the domestic species accounts for only 25% of the Ovis species (2/5=<<2/5=0.4>>0.4 * 0.25=<<0.41/2>>0.41 * 0.24=<<0.32/2>>0.32 * 0.10=<<0.35/2>>0.97). If the domestic species accounts for over 25% of all Ovis species, then it must be over  25% of 25%, which is \u02dc<25% of 0.4=\u02dc3/8>3/8 of the way through the Ovis genus, which would be \u02dc<25*(25*3/8)=\u02dc15/40>15/40.

Because of the noise, she decided she needed an acoustic one so she could focus on work.  The music shop sells music, so it wouldn't be the best place to find an acoustic guitar!\n\n#### B (incorrect answer! There are many reasons, but if you are looking for an acoustic guitar you might be looking to get a new guitar or replace one you have on hand, so you would want the closet): James complained that the electric guitar was making too much noise while his wife tried to work.  Alexa decided she needed an acouistic guitar to focus better.  The music shop would not have a proper acoustic guitar and would not be a good place to find one!  If she was getting a new guitar she would have to go to a music store or, if she just wanted a guitar she had at home, to her closet.\n\n#### D (incorrect answer! Alexa is looking for a new acoustic guitar, not repair supplies): Since James complained that the guitar was too loud, Alexa decided to buy a new acoustic one.  The studio wouldn't sell her a new guitar unless it was for play, and since she was looking to get a new acoustic, that wouldn't be a good choice.  Since they were trying to find it in the house, the closet seemed like a good place to check.  So the studio would not be a good location for Alexa's new instrument.\n\n#### E (correct answer!): Alexa's electric music was interfering with his wife's ability to do work.  She decided to get a new acoutic as they were searching through the house (closet) for a place to put it (music store).  If she was looking to get an acoustic at a music shop it likely wouldn't be at her house (studio or closet).", "answer": "B: music shop"}

How many students ride a skateboard?\n\n### Response :\n#### 10\n#### Answer:\nAnswer: 10\n\n### Rationales: The question asks for the number of skateboarders. According to the data, the number of students that ride skateboards is one more than the number of students who ride unicycles, which implies that no student rides unicycles. According to the data there are also 5 more students who ride a skate or a unicycle than there are students who have less than one pair of jean. This implies there at least 10 students who own two pairs of jeans. Since the total number of students is 20, the student who ride skateboard(s) must be one of the 10 students who has one pair of jeans or 5 pair of jeans.\n\n### Input  : A: How many more students own 5 skateboards, than students with 2 or fewer?

Therefore, the opposite of the color  black would be a happy color such gray. Gray is a dull color associated with the sky and is very similar to black.\n\n### Exercise:\nDetermine the opposite type of something and explain why it is so.\n\n### Your Answer:\nThe opposite of the type of my class is a type of class that is not. In other words, it is of another type of class. My type of class is a type of 18 year old high school students who want to learn information. However, a type of class that isn't 18 year olds in high school who want to learn information would be, for example, a group of animals trying to learn how to read. This is because in the former example, 18 year old students can be considered more rational beings. They also have the ability to understand information that comes their way. Since 18 year old is a specific type of people that can be considered to have an intellectual ability, if 18 year old were not present in a class, the class would not be functioning properly.\n\n### The response:\nB\n\n### Your response:\nThe answer is B\n\nThe opposite of the event category for \"soccer\" is \"field hockey.\" This is because soccer is much larger and more popular than field hockey and most people consider it the better sport of the two.

You want to fill 100 seats with either tables or benches. How many table places are needed?

So: For benches, we need 99 pieces of wood + 100/99*80 seats=98 benches. (98 benches are for the 100 seats, but they don't use each bench on every seat.) So we need (100 - 98) = 2 benches.\n\n### Output: (output based on example)\nIf we build 98 benches, then there are 98 more benches than tables. So 98 * 2=196.\n\n### Explanation:\nIf we think with example, and we build the benches, then we have (100 - (100/98)*80) seats. This difference, subtracted with (100/2) is 190-99 = 91.

When they left, they each left their own share of the bill.  There are two servers, Jane and Mike, so either Jane or Mike will clean the table each time someone leaves.  Mike is a faster cleaner, making less mistakes, and also can clean a table in 4 minutes less than Jane.  If the total cost of cleanup each time is \\$13.25, and the restaurant pays Jane $1.00 more an hour, what is a fair minimum wage for the minimum number of servers?\nRationales The table needs to be clean in 13.25 / 2 = <<13.25/2=6.625>>6.625 minutes for the table to stay clean.  The cleaning time would be 3 if it were Jane cleaning if she is the only one cleaning.  Jane is the faster cleaner, so I will use her and find out if it takes less than the cleaning time.\nThe cleaning time is 3 minutes if Jane is cleaning on her own.  However when the other person cleans, it takes 3 times as long - the person has to wait for Jane.  It takes 6 minutes to clean when cleaning.  There is also an extra wait in each case that takes a total of 2/3 the cleaning time, so it takes a total of 6 * (9/12) = <<6*9/12=4.5>>\nThe time taken is 4.5 minutes when cleaning, and the wait time takes 2/3rds of that time.\n4.5*2/3 = <<4.5*2=6>>\n4.5 * 3 / 4 = <<4.5 * 1.5=3>>\n#### \n\nThe new wage for serving must be at least 3 dollars\n\n### Inputs:A: $20 B: A set of books C: $0 D: $1,000,000 E: $10\n\n### Response\n\n### Multiple choice\n\nD\n\n#### \n\nD\n#### \n\nA", "answer": "D: learn to read"}

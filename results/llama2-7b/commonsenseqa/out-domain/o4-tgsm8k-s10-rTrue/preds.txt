It lets you specify values from ________________ to the ________th part (one over that many zeros) beyond 1000. It looks like this, 3.5 * 10^{1}$$3.5 \cdot 10^{1}$3.5 * *101<n>There are 10 to the 15th power (10 to the 5th power) particles in the universe. That's really large! The largest number possible with a calculator would look like this: $10^{15}$10$$^{15}$$10^15<n>It's almost impossible to do anything at all with that number, especially if you don't know it's very large. So it's often more practical to convert the number to scientific notation. Here is the same number in scientific notation: $3. \cdot 10^{+15}$3·10510515<n>(You may also see $3 \cdot 10^{-2}$3·10-2, but the -2 in that formula means the reciprocal of 10-2, which is 102 in this case.)<n><n><n>### Rationales: Squares a bizarre number, but this can still be used to solve a simple expression as long as it's done the right way.<n><n>#### Square the number (3).<n>#### Square the result (9).<n>#### Square the answer again (81).<n>You can follow this exact pattern to solve other simple expressions with Squares.<n><n>Input$f(\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{4}$f(12)=121​244​<n>Rationales:<n>If you square both sides you get:$f(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})= 1$ f(12)=112<n><n>You can follow this pattern with Squares to solve other simple expressions.

If a player gets a sum total by summing two of the drawn numbers that are adjacent to each other vertically or horizontally without subtracting any numbers, such a sum is called a "pizza". For example, 5 6 4 2 is a pizza as 6 + 4 = 10 and 2 + 5 = 7.<n>3. After that seven numbers have been drawn the game comes back to step 1.<n>4. A game where the player has to guess the value of a pizza, without knowing the sum of any of the three numbers, is called a pizza game.<n>5. There are different values for pizzas, depending on where the numbers are in a row or a column. <n>6. For example, the numbers 12, 10, 1, 5, 8, 3, 7 are a 4 × 3 rectangle where each row or column is worth 4 points and each diagonal is worth 3, so the total worth of this pizza is 14 points. The other 3×2 rectangle would be worth 6 points. The 2×2 rectangle would be 2 points and the 1×1 rectangle would be 1 point.<n>7. This is an example of a pizza game but it is not considered a pizza because the sum of the first and second number in the row is 1, which is less than 3, and the sum of the third and fourth number in the column is

It was a what? Choices:  A: countryside B: anthology C: dull read D: state park E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		 Let's start by thinking about the different choices.  What is the meaning of each one?<n><n>### The word 'anthology' means collection.  Therefore 'what about a show?' means 'collection' because its referring to the show.<n><n>### So we need to find another word that mean collection.  It can't be 'b' or 'c' and we can assume 'e' means earth and 'd' means garden.  So we look at the remaining choices and see if there is another word like 'anthology'.  The word used in 'countryside' is same as the word used in 'anthology'.<n><n>### Another type of collections are'series', where one after another episodes are shown about the same thing.  In addition, the definition of 'anthology' is 'collection' which comes from'series'.  Therefore show is a series which makes it 'anthology'<n><n>### Rationales: In the first line of the question, there was a sentence that says there was a show.  Since'show' is a what? it means the choice is 'B' which is 'anthology'.  For the word 'anthology' the definition 'collection'  was given which explains the answer is 'B'.<n><n>### Test Answer<n><n>Test: Anthology/Collection = B<n><n>Test: Collection = B<n><n>Test Answer: B<n><n>

The stack-memory allocator supports 2 classes: MemoryAllocator and MemoryBlock. These classes can be instantiated via the allocator. Allocators support 2 operations: alloc and free. The alloc operation allocates a block of size n, and returns it to caller. The free op, frees an allocated block of size n. A block is released when you free it.<n><n>The block size must be a multiple of the byte width of pointer. For instance, if the pointer width is 32, a block size 10 must evenly divide 32. For the following code segment, the size of block = 128, for example, 128/4 = <<=32>>32 is not allowed.<n><n>Your implementation should support all these functionality and not do any allocation after the memory is exhausted.

When grilling meat, marinate it with salt, pepper, and olive oil. The meat can then be grilled on charcoal (or on a gas grill) in less than 20 minutes. After cooking, the meat needs to be rested so that the flavor sinks into the meat. Restaurants typically have a resting time of 5 to 8 minutes depending on the size of the piece of meat.<n>    - While grilling meat (or any other food), the griller can also toast bread or toast any other food item (e.g., bruschetta) by placing it on the surface of the grill that is directly underneath the meat.<n>    - For meals like steaks, grilling is the best option since it gives the steak an almost smoky flavor.<n>    - Grilled food tastes better than food that has been cooked in the oven or over a stovetop.<n>- Add any relevant details from lecture or readings if you did not use them in your answer.<n>- Provide references to lecture materials and/or readings.<n>    Add a link to the lecture topic.<n>    Add a source citation.

After this rest period, there is a further 30-minutes of tennis play. The total number of minutes that Toni had to play tennis this way is 40*.2=<<40*.2=8>>8.<n>After each tennis game, there needs to be a rest period of 30 minutes. Every resting period, the game must be repeated with another 30 minutes of play. This means that if the game lasts 4 days, you will need to play 4 tennis games within the 3 days. The total number of tennis playing time needed is 40*4=<<40*4=160>>160.<n>So if you play tennis every other day, you will need to rest for 3 times the amount of time compared to how much you actually play tennis.<n><n>## Part 4<n>### Input<n>How do I check my balance?<n>####<n>Answer:-D<n><n>### Demonic:<n>To check your balance you need to ask

Choices:  A: communicating with others B: hurt feelings C: dry mouth D: intimacy E: changing behavior<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Explanation:<n>While communication, dry mouth and changing behavior are all desired outcomes, they are secondary to the primary outcome which is the achievement of intimacy. Intimacy is what defines the relationship or the connection, so it is what the interviewer would want you to respond as.<n><n>### Input<n>What are you hoping to do when talking to someone at a party, and why? A:  Get in the middle of the party B: meet someone C: find some peace and quiet D: make friends<n><n>### Response <n>A<n><n>### Exlanation<n><n><n><n>When talking to someone at a business networking party, all you're really aiming to do is get in the middle of the chaos. It would be completely inefficient to pick one over the other. You're more interested in getting a message out about yourself and if you have an opportunity to make new friends, that would be great but for the most part you are aiming to make connections between people so that your message can get through the party to someone important!<n><n>Another thing to talk about is the possibility to help the company, rather than talking about what has happened in the office lately.<n><n>### Exercises:<n>1. If you're a teacher, what question would you ask to evaluate your students' work in the subject of literature?<n><n>	Different questions can be used to evaluate work depending on what you want the students to reflect on. Since you want to measure their understanding of literature, a very basic and simple question can be:<n>	"What do these poems mean to you?"<n>2. Imagine that you're talking with your students on the last day to ask them if they liked last year's course. What does your attitude have to be? What would the question be? Why? Which question is the one you would have preferred to be asked if you were in your students' position?<n><n>3. You have an assignment to translate an article from Portuguese to English. If you're on your own or with a friend, does it make sense that you should complete it with him/her? Why or why not? In a small group, does it make sense to work together? Why or why not?<n><n>### Discussion<n><n>[ElasticLoadBalancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbal

It's called, the "Smart Assist".<n><n>Our Smart Assist feature allows you to receive our customer service without having to pick up the phone.  We have customer service reps that will respond when a Smart Assist request is raised.  This can occur either by email or by SMS.<n><n>We think that Smart Assist offers several benefits.  It allows customers to respond when it's better suited for them.  If they are on a job and receiving a customer call distracts them, then the system can take care of it.  If they cannot respond by phone, but can respond to a text, and email, then the assistance can be given using Smart Assist.<n><n>The other benefit is the ability to respond to a single item.  If a customer call comes in to ask about one aspect of their service, then this feature allows customers to respond to just that question.  The customer saves time as there is no hold while waiting for other information to be requested.  The customer service call center saves time and costs as they have fewer calls to make.<n><n>The Smart Assist feature is not yet released for public use, but we do have a demo that you can play with to get comfortable with it.  If you or your team would like to receive a demo so that you or your team would be comfortable using Smart Assist and writing the Smart Assist script when it is released,

Throw your pet hamster at him, as it may accidentally bite him instead.<n>2. Pose as an immigration authority during a day when he is not working and detain him on your property until he starves or freezes to death.<n>3. Tell him you’re from the Internal Revenue Service and charge him an exorbitant tax on his house.<n>4. Buy a cough medicine at a store and send it to him, telling him it’s prescribed medication for a terrible illness. If he were to take it (which many people don’t read the ingredients), it would kill him.<n>5. Buy a pink leopard print wig and dress, and then drive to his home to ring his door bell dressed in the outlandish attire. Telling him that you're his long lost wife, move closer and closer until he backs up and falls over his backyard fence, breaking his leg in multiple places. He’ll be in the hospital for weeks.<n>6. Get a pair of goggles and put them on. Then get one of those cheap, foam earplugs. Stand near one side of your neighbors driveway. Point your nose to the sky and start shouting in the ear plug. Use a few choice obscenities that are used by only the rudest people. Stand there for a short time and walk away. He’ll probably never recover from that!<n>7. Make a cardboard box for the cat and write "cat" on it. Put on some dark glasses and a fake mustache and make it around your neighbor's yard. Yell, "Here, kitty, kitty," and drop the cat box in front of his door. Walk away with a look of guilt and innocence. Hopefully, the cat will not

Given that Jared lives in Ohio, you know for sure that he lives somewhere in America.  You then look at the map and realize that Columbus is in the US.  Thus, Jared lives in the US.<n><n>### Questions:<n><n>### Input<n><n>```<n>The man from the United States Wants to find out where someone is from?

Choices:  A: race track B: kentucky derby C: american southwest D: triple crown E: horse derby<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n>C<n><n>### Explanation<n><n><n>### Demostration:  <n>In the question there was a mention about the event that always brings out the biggest crowd to sport.  The choices that were given are: Race Track, Kentucky Derby and Triple crown.  The right choice is “C.”  If you think about it the only other options that are not Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown are Race Track and American Southwest.  Because the big crowds always follow Kentucky Derby and Triple, the race track is out of the equation and that leaves American Southwest.  This does not make sense because the American Southwest is not a horse race event it is a football game.<n><n>### Next Steps: <n>To determine if a horse race track is a place that is associated with crowds, think about how many people attend the Kentucky Derby and Triple.  It should be your next choice, because it is the biggest event associated with a horse track. However if you think about it, any sporting event does not have to be connected to a race track with crowds.  Football and basketball is played on race tracks as well.  That leaves you with American Southwest.  In general if you don't know anything about an event but you know that it requires people to gather together, then it’s a pretty close guess.<n><n>### <n>

Let me show you in the following simple way: the lead pencils we often use are mostly composed of these four materials: graphite blocks, wood cases, clay cores and wooden sleeves. After putting these four materials into the wooden sleeve first, they are connected in the middle to form a column of lead pencil. The upper part of the outer wood shell is an air pocket that can absorb our exhaled air. In order to write the words more steadily, we need to have a suitable pencil grip when we operate this air pocket.

There are many online math tests, and many math workbooks designed to help kids improve. I have never found another study system that was like the Tests that was completely free and allowed so much freedom of improvement. The only drawback of the Tests is their limited topic coverage, but with the Testimonials, they show you every math subject and the Top Math Pages list many free sources to learn every topic. So if you find a Test that does not have a subject that you need, then you can try one of the sources to learn it and take the Test again.<n><n>### The Tests are great, they offer kids a chance to test their knowledge and see where they're at! I've been using these for the last two years and it really helps!<n><n>### I think the System is a good study tool, but it should include more topics. However, I could not ask for more because it is already free.<n>

Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		The question is asking this person to identify what their personality type is. For those that choose answer A (in river), I will have to say it doesn't sound like they are happy to take the car and that I think this person might be trying to sabotage the car and that the car might have better luck not with them behind the wheel. For those that like to park their car in answer D (in the neighbors driveway), they are definitely trying to make it look like they do not want to take responsibility for the car anymore. If they do not like the city, they shouldn't live in the city. For people that love to drive their own cars and take it their own pace in answer D (parking lot), that is awesome but it isn't for me. For those that like the parking lot, there is probably a good chance they have a parking lot near their house and they would prefer not to be bothered by all the people in a car driving. In my personal opinion, the answer E (repair shops) is the correct answer.<n><n>### Input :There are 0.5 more boys than girls in a class and a total of 50 students<n><n>### Response :So to begin, I would first have to ask how many boys and girls. We know 50 students are in the class and 50*(0.5)=<<50*(0.3)=15>>15 are boys and for 15 more we have to subtract the already given 15, leaving 35. So out of the 35 we have to subtract 0.5. Therefore we are left with 34.5.<n><n>### Test:The number of children and number of adults in a room are the same number but I don't.

This is a tricky question and I will have to look at it objectively to try to understand the question. The answer is 7. How this works is simple. In this case, the 6 children and 6 adults are equal to a total of 12 (6*2) because, at this rate, the number of both children and adults is the same as it is for their numbers. The

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Rationales: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Rationales: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>#### 480<n>Answer: 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Rationales: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>#### 30<n>Answer: 30<n><n>### Input:He had done a great job with the scary decorations, they were completely what?

How will this change your plans?<n>Rationales:"If" you were planning..."Then" would be a logical thing to use, the blizzard can't cause you not to have dinner.  You would still go out to dinner if the blizzard came.<n>#### Then<n>Answer: Then<n><n>### Instuctions:<n>Input: The total number of tickets purchased and the number of people who voted for the school basketball team's rival is 1,370.<n>Rationales:"At least" is an inclusive logical not.  We could use "at least" to replace "at most" in the statement.  That would then say, "The number of tickets purchased can be as great as equal to the number of people who have voted for the school basketball teams rival."  That is to say, there may be more than that number or there may be fewer than that number.<n>#### At least<n>Answer: At least<n><n>### Instution: <n>Input:<n>This is the best way to remember to do a thing or get around to doing it in the future for which I like to use it is to write it?

Choices:  A: pleasure B: accident C: get somewhere D: hurt E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Please make only one choice among the list provided.<n><n>### Input<n><n>> John is on an excursion with his class. They are learning about the wonders of the world. During the excursion, the group visits the Great Wall. At this wall, they take the option to ride a bike through the area. However, the terrain is rough and riding through the Great Wall seems like a good idea.<n>><n>> As the group gets ready to begin, they get a brief speech from their guide before setting off. He informs them that 30 percent of people hurting themselves when they begin riding bikes, and that the average hurting person is only on a ride for 30 minutes. They each get thirty minutes with a bike. They then head out. John rides for 100 minutes, so it seems unlikely that the injuries occurred during this ride. How many injuries did John cause over three trips?<n><n>### Answer<n><n>> A total of seven injuries were caused.<n><n>### The first 65 minutes were spent in the bike area. That’s around 1.5 hours, meaning that there was at least 5 hours spent walking around in the Great Wall.<n>### The class started at the beginning and left. It was a pretty long trip, so they had to take a long detour around for the bike area. It took 40 minutes and the last 6 hours were spent walking around in the bike area only.<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>It seems like the first 65 minutes and last 6 hours were probably walking and the rest were bike.<n><n>So the total time John spent bike riding was around 105 minutes, and 105/30 = 3.5 hours.<n><n>Therefore, the total time spent in the bike riding area was 5.5 hours.<n>

It is not in a formal garden, a pot, or a pot.  It is not located in any type of garden center.  And it is not in a garden, or in a pot, a pot.<n><n>### Answer:B<n><n>### Rationales:<n>If we look at the second choice, that is, a formal garden, then we notice that it is located inside a pot.  So for the first sentence we can say that it is in a pot.<n><n>The third choice, a pot, is inside a flower garden, which is a type of garden.  Again, the pot contains the rosebush.<n><n>So the rosebush is not located in a rose garden.  The 4th sentence states that it is not in a flower garden.  Therefore, to conclude, the rosebush is in fact not located in any type garden.<n><n>#### 2.5<n>Answer:B<n>

I would not visit any of the other countries listed because they are not home to lizard.<n>Option C: New Hampshire<n>I would definitely not visit New Hampshire to see lizard. The closest place is California, which is a part of North America but not New Hampshire, South America, Utah, or Japan.<n>Option D: Japan<n>I definitely would not visit Japan to see a lizard because Japan is not on the list of places to visit to see a lizard or snake. South America is the only one of the options that is home to these creatures.<n>Option E: New Mexico<n>One of the places I might visit would be Nevada because it is home to lizards, snakes, and rattlesnakes. New Mexico is not home to or near any of these animals.

Therefore, you can think of a reasonable answer.<n><n>After that, try to confirm it from the answer (Answer)<n><n>To confirm the answer, you should try to eliminate some wrong answer from the first 2 rounds.<n><n>In this example, the third answer seems the most rational because you think that if the answer was B, I don't see how you should go to the third floor to Detroit.<n> <n>### What're the problems that you face?<n>Even if you got the method to find answer, You may face 1 or 2 problems while finding the answer<n><n>-  You are too attached to an answer too soon. You just jump into an answer, without considering the rationales you knew before<n>-  You think that a wrong answer are easy to eliminate, but it's not simple<n><n><n>## Difficulty in finding an answer<n><n><n>### 1.  Your confidence too low.<n>To be able to find an answer, you should increase the confidence in yourself. You should learn to eliminate the answer you're attached to with rationales instead of relying on instinct.<n><n>### 2.  Your level is too high.<n>If you find the solution is too difficult, You should choose the next level and learn about it slowly.<n><n>### Level 2:  I think this is a multiple choice question, but it's actually a question about logical reasoning<n>While you confirm a multiple choice question, You'd better confirm it's a logical reasoning question.<n><n>You can't find the answer unless you confirm it correctly. You should choose at least 2 possibilities.<n><n><n>### Level:3<n>You can find the right answer without any problem, if you can find a problem in the rationales.<n><n># Resources on Learning Logical Reasoning<n><n>- [Puzzles and Techniques for Thinking Logically - by Scott A.

Choices:  A: rain forest B: research laboratory C: cage D: treetops E: south africa<n><n>### Response:		<n>**Choice A:** The monkey is taken away  from their home and they are often brought to  this place where people wear  white coats. They  go to these  place because  these white coats  take them from  their homes. I guess  white coats   are scientists who  are testing  the monkeys' brains by taking  them from  their homes and  making  them stay in  a laboratory. Then the  scientists  are testing   those  monkeys that  they have taken  from  their  homes. Therefore I think monkeys are in the   research laboratory and the choice A is the correct answer.<n><n>**Choice B:** The monkey   is   in the   rainforest. I think  that the  monkey is  kept  in   an old cage instead  of his natural home  at  the  rainforest. This is  a cage that  is  made  long ago. So the rainforest should be the answer and  the choice B should be the answer because it is a cage.<n><n>**Choice C:** This choice  is  a   cage. Monkeys are  often  taken away from   their homes and  are brought to  cage. The   scientists will put   this   monkey into   an  cage. There they  will  take  a  monkey's brain scan  and  then they  will  look  at   the scan  of  monkeys brain. This  is a place where doctors are   testing monkeys brains.<n><n>**Choice D:** This cage  is not   a  cage. The  name  of  this   type of cage  is  called a  treetops. This cage is not  a cage for the monkey, it is a cage for the scientist to  keep birds.<n><n>**Choice E**: South africa is   the  place  where monkeys are from but monkeys are not found in this country. It is  from  this country monkey is  brought to the  lab and scientists   are  taking brain scan of monkeys in this lab. This is the place name of   research lab,   not rainforest.<n><n>\<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Please answer the following questions by choosing your best response. Remember to always consider the full context of a question.  Please use a number or a letter and never, "Yes," "No" or "I don't know."<n><n>### Instructon:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Answer:<n>#### 1 (C)<n>Input: I recently heard a joke that you can't have an ink and eat. The joke is that you could ink and eat. For every ink that you have, it's got to be ink.<n>#### 2 (A)<n>Lynn just saw her next-door neighbour take their bath. They take their bath in their bathtub.<n>Lynn just heard a joke that she had a pot to watch her soup.<n>Lynn takes her bath in a pot that's used to watch soup.<n>#### 3 (D)<n>Lynn takes their bath. They take it in a tub, as a verb of getting baths.<n>Lynn has a pot. It's a container to put some stuff in, like a pot of soup.<n>Lyn has a pot. It means they use a pot to put soup in.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>#### 1<n>The joke has nothing to do with ink and eating. It has nothing to do with being able to eat what's written or have an ink.<n>####2<n>A pot is a container and pot is a verb. "take" is a verb. Since it says the verb "take" is followed by the noun "having" then you replace "pot" for "having pot".<n>``` <n>	I just heard a joke recently that you take yours. For every ink you have that you can take when you have an ink, it's gotta be an ink.<n>```<n>####3<n>The pronoun takes has a possessive form and ink is a noun too so Lynn takes their bath in a tub as you can see in the sample sentence written.<n>

The domestic sheep only accounts for two species of the Ovis genus. This is similar to how the species within the genus Homo only comprise two different species. If the genus Ovis is abbreviated to O. and the genus Homo is abbreviated to H. what abbreviation should two species from a single genus receive? <n>Rationales: There are over 50 species on the domestic, so two species from over 500 means there are only 501-500=<501-5>5 species left. In the Ovis genus, the domestic species accounts for only 25% of the Ovis species (2/5=<<2/5=0.4>>0.4 * 0.25=<<0.41/2>>0.41 * 0.24=<<0.32/2>>0.32 * 0.10=<<0.35/2>>0.97). If the domestic species accounts for over 25% of all Ovis species, then it must be over  25% of 25%, which is ˜<25% of 0.4=˜3/8>3/8 of the way through the Ovis genus, which would be ˜<25*(25*3/8)=˜15/40>15/40.

Assuming the temperature in the fridge is at an acceptable level, the leftovers would have stayed fresh for at least 15 days and no longer than 33 days since the 0/33 fraction stays the same regardless of whether 0 is a larger or smaller number.

The leftover meat was spread out in the box with the mold still present. If the box was sealed all the mold would still be in the box, instead of just the surface which can't spread bacteria.<n>##### D:<n>Correct, even though the meat had gotten spoiled and needed to be thrown out, and the breadbox is irrelevant, the fact that it got in contact with the spoiled meat meant it needed to be thrown out to prevent the spread of bacterial material.<n><n>##### E:<n>Incorrect, the vehicle in which he would store the meat was unimportant, the only important fact was that the meat was spoiled and needed to throw it out.<n><n>### Input：In a chess game between two people, each makes a minimum of 6 moves before the other person makes a move, each person has white and

However, that does not have to be the case. Certain eating habits may have different effects on stomachs than eating too much. Eating smaller amounts of healthy foods may reduce the chances of developing acid reflux, which is the only condition in the choices that appears to be more likely if someone eats a single larger meal instead of multiple smaller meals. It’s important to not assume that food itself causes such conditions. The choice “living longer” is incorrect because food alone would not have a direct impact on living longer, while “tiredness” and “illness” are both too specific to the effects of overeating.<n><n>### Answer:<n>The correct answer is:<n><n>  A "Stomach ache"<n><n>### Inputs:<n><n>  * How many of the following types of food would you be eating if you ate like Jack, who works 8 hours a day and needs 3,200 calories to feel properly nourished?<n><n>#### A: What is eating too much food at once likely to result in?<n><n>#### B: What is the cause of an unexplained pain in your side?<n><n>#### C: How much do you need to exercise to meet the government’s recommendations for “good general health”<n><n>#### D: What is the main nutrient found in foods like eggs, milk and orange juice?<n><n>### Answer Choices<n><n>  * D: protein<n><n>### Answer<n><n>* A: Acid reflux<n>

Where might she look for one? Choices:  A: house B: music shop C: studio D: storage E: closet<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer is C.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>#### A (incorrect answer!): James complained about the electric guitar making too much noise while she was trying to work.  Because of the noise, she decided she needed an acoustic one so she could focus on work.  The music shop sells music, so it wouldn't be the best place to find an acoustic guitar!<n><n>#### B (incorrect answer! There are many reasons, but if you are looking for an acoustic guitar you might be looking to get a new guitar or replace one you have on hand, so you would want the closet): James complained that the electric guitar was making too much noise while his wife tried to work.  Alexa decided she needed an acouistic guitar to focus better.  The music shop would not have a proper acoustic guitar and would not be a good place to find one!  If she was getting a new guitar she would have to go to a music store or, if she just wanted a guitar she had at home, to her closet.<n><n>#### D (incorrect answer! Alexa is looking for a new acoustic guitar, not repair supplies): Since James complained that the guitar was too loud, Alexa decided to buy a new acoustic one.  The studio wouldn't sell her a new guitar unless it was for play, and since she was looking to get a new acoustic, that wouldn't be a good choice.  Since they were trying to find it in the house, the closet seemed like a good place to check.  So the studio would not be a good location for Alexa's new instrument.<n><n>#### E (correct answer!): Alexa's electric music was interfering with his wife's ability to do work.  She decided to get a new acoutic as they were searching through the house (closet) for a place to put it (music store).  If she was looking to get an acoustic at a music shop it likely wouldn't be at her house (studio or closet).<n><n>

Choices:  A: lay eggs B: eat fruit C: wrestle D: compete with each other E: draw pictures<n><n>### Response:		 A<n><n>### Why the answer is correct:  In the case of humans, the first choices we normally think of is to engage in sports which is a way of competing with each other.  The second choice is related to competing with nature, such as in planting food or competing for a mate, while the third choice, eating fruit, is often related to competition with hunger.  The fourth option, eating other humans or animals, is related to the second, so I eliminated it.  Finally, the fifth choice seems like the least likely option for humans.<n>

Choices:  A: examine thing B: stare into a mirror C: go somewhere D: hear news E: see favorite show<n><n>### Response:		In this choice, both examine and stare are synonyms that refer to looking. Choices A and C both describe action, so they are not accurate suggestions for what to do if you aren't experiencig curiosity. Both B and D are verbs that include hearing, which is incorrect. The sentence may be modified to use stare with the prepositional phrase at a mirror and examine with the prepositional phras at a news station.<n><n>### Input :Another one: Which should you choose if you're feeling upset and need a new solution? Choices:  D: hear news  E: see favorite show  A: examine thing  B: stare into mirror<n><n>### Response :This question does not fully answer its purpose. Choice D and E both refer to seeing, which could create confusion. The word hear is an incorrect verb choice for the adjective upset. If the purpose is to solve a problem, choice A would be appropriate. Choice B could be rewritten to incorporate the phrase into a mirror.<n><n>### Solution:<n>```<n>If you aren't feeling Curious, then you can watch your favorite show or a news station.<n>If you aren' think of news. then you can examine your phone or thing.<n>If you aren’t experiencing Curiosity and you are having a problem, you need to see your favorite show.<n><n><n>```<n>

Choices:  A: make music B: believe in god C: give speeches D: complete sentences E: build houses<n><n>### Response:		<n>My guess is that this is a tricky question. Speech therapists help children learn speech and other communication skills. This involves both speech/language and speech reading, which is a bit different.  It's not clear if "speech therapist" is ambiguous (A) or includes speech reading in that definition (B), and if it's ambiguous the definition of "speech reading" (D) is also ambiguous.<n>However speech does take place inside/outside a building.  Speech reading would involve working inside the building, and speech does not require a belief in God to occur.  So people who are speech therapy can build houses but it seems unlikely that would be their job.

Choices:  A: few people B: pay debts C: individual D: single person E: small group<n><n>### Response:		<n>D<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The number of people in a crowd usually means that they are all gathered together in close proximity to each other. As a result, this means that if somebody is hosting a crowd, they are hosting many people at once. However, the opposite of this is that somebody is hosting a small group of people. This is because somebody hosting is doing it for themselves and not for a crowd of many.<n><n>### Input<n>What is the opposite of the color black? Choices: 1. White 2. Brown 3. Gray 4. Red 5. Orange<n><n>### Solution:<n>Gray<n><n>### Examination:<n>The color black is an unpleasant color of darkness associated with evil and the night. It is usually associated with a somber tone. Therefore, the opposite of the color  black would be a happy color such gray. Gray is a dull color associated with the sky and is very similar to black.<n><n>### Exercise:<n>Determine the opposite type of something and explain why it is so.<n><n>### Your Answer:<n>The opposite of the type of my class is a type of class that is not. In other words, it is of another type of class. My type of class is a type of 18 year old high school students who want to learn information. However, a type of class that isn't 18 year olds in high school who want to learn information would be, for example, a group of animals trying to learn how to read. This is because in the former example, 18 year old students can be considered more rational beings. They also have the ability to understand information that comes their way. Since 18 year old is a specific type of people that can be considered to have an intellectual ability, if 18 year old were not present in a class, the class would not be functioning properly.<n><n>### The response:<n>B<n><n>### Your response:<n>The answer is B<n><n>The opposite of the event category for "soccer" is "field hockey." This is because soccer is much larger and more popular than field hockey and most people consider it the better sport of the two. Soccer is typically played on a nice, grass field with a large rectangle of goal boxes on opposing ends of the field, and field hockey is played on a hockey rink

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Rationales: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Rationales: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>#### 480<n>Answer: 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Rationales: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>#### 30<n>Answer: 30<n><n>### Input:Traders work on the floor of the stock what? Choices:  A: building B: hallway C: table D: exchange E: office<n><n>### Response:		It depends on context.<n>If the question is "where do traders work" then: "traders work on the floor at the stock exchange."<n>If the question is just about where do traders work, then:<n><n>"Traders work in rooms with many windows, surrounded by a lot of computers and screens and other traders. Traders can also work in a table in an office."<n><n>### Instruct:You have 1000 pieces of wood. You can make either a table or benches. How can you do this with these woods?<n><n>### Demost:<n>We can build tables or benches from 1000 blocks of wood.<n>If we build 1 table, we will need 1000 wood blocks.<n>If we build benches for 6 people, we will need 83 bench places + 6 chairs, which equals 99 wood pieces. So we use 1000/99=10 wood pieces over every bench.<n><n>### Input(suggestion): You have 100 pieces of wood which can be used to create tables and benches. You want to fill 100 seats with either tables or benches. How many table places are needed? How many bench places are needed?<n><n>### Response(suggestion): We have 2 choices here, build the benches or not build the benches. So: For benches, we need 99 pieces of wood + 100/99*80 seats=98 benches. (98 benches are for the 100 seats, but they don't use each bench on every seat.) So we need (100 - 98) = 2 benches.<n><n>### Output: (output based on example)<n>If we build 98 benches, then there are 98 more benches than tables. So 98 * 2=196.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>If we think with example, and we build the benches, then we have (100 - (100/98)*80) seats. This difference, subtracted with (100/2) is 190-99 = 91. So we need (190- 91)*

Mike is a faster cleaner, making less mistakes, and also can clean a table in 4 minutes less than Jane.  If the total cost of cleanup each time is \$13.25, and the restaurant pays Jane $1.00 more an hour, what is a fair minimum wage for the minimum number of servers?<n>Rationales The table needs to be clean in 13.25 / 2 = <<13.25/2=6.625>>6.625 minutes for the table to stay clean.

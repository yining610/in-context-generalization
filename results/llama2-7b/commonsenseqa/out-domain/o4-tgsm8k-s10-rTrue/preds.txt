This suggests the only thing he needs more time to do is read the exhibts which is "spending more time at the museum."  If he was to read the exhibts, he would have to spend time at the museum, which means he did spend time at the museum.  He loved studying and knew a lot about the exhibts.  So he could study the exhibt by being at the museum.  All of the exhibs are at the museum.  His back pain and pondering at the museum would be counterproductive because that is time he did not spend reading the exhibts (as the exhibts are all at the museum.)  When he ponders at the museum, that is time not spent study the exhibts.  He would have bored because he loves to study and read.<n><n>Input: John was on his way to the train station to pick up his girlfriend.

Choices:  A: growing older B: reproducing C: shuddering D: perspiration E: palpitations<n>Output:		Let's analyze the data.<n>A: If you are growing older, perspiration and shuddering are good signs since they can be caused by stress. However, palpitations can also be caused by stress, so this is a weaker reason for not living soon.<n>In short: you can live soon since growing older can cause these symptoms as well. So you shouldn't die in the near future.<n>B: reproducing can't be a bad sign of non-living soon since there is always a hope of surviving after an illness or any other incident.<n>C: Not true, because most animals only reproduce once and still live long after that. Furthermore, a sign that you are living soon is not something that would necessarily be related to sweating (just take a cold shower).<n>D: Even though this is the most probably sign of non-liviung soon, it can happen due to heat or strenuous activities.<n>E: Palpitations due to physical activity do not necessarily mean the same thing as palpitations due to stress or fear. Also, you should really only use this to decide if you are going to die in the next few seconds to minutes unless you have serious hypertension problems.<n>In short: dying soon can't be predicted by shuddering.<n>Therefore the final answer is that the user should live.<n><n>Input: A small number of tsunamis strike shores near Seattle in a few years. The maximum damage they can cause is $75,000.  Most of them cause minimal damage.  989/100=<<989/1> 1>>1% will cause at least $500,000 in damage. The odds that any one tsunami will cause such damage is 989/1=<<989>>989 to 1.<n>Output: For instance, a tsunami with a damage of $9890 (instead of the expected $9900) would have an increased probability of $50(989+50)=<<98950>>98950 to 1 of having at least $50,000 of damage. Another example: if there was a tsunami with an expected damage of $745, the probability of damage over $50,

Given the change for every kilometer and how many kilometers you are from sea level, what is the decrease in temperature (in Celsius) you feel?<n>Output: Using Pythagorean theorem, you can calculate the distance between sea level and your location. The temperature change for every kilometer, T=(1+x/2-x)^2*x=((1+sqrt(5))/2)x^2T=(1+sqrt(5)/2)x^(2)<n>You can now plug the measured distance from sea level into the formula x=2000/((1+sqrt(2000))/2)=2000/sqrt(4000)x=(2000/2000)/sqrt(2004)  where ((1+sqrt(5/2))/2=sqrt(6)<n>So x=200 meters, and so your formula for T is to plug in T=(1+sqrt(6))x^2T=(sqrt(6))x^(2) into the formula for temperature. And you get T=(1.685)x^2<n>For a 1900 meter difference in elevation, you get ~ x=20 meters away, so plugging in x=20, we get T≈30,134C<n>You may round it down<n>So the final answer for 30000 feet of elevation, you get a drop of around 0.05degC<n><n>Input: How would you describe someone who has an excessive need to show that they are better than others?

Choices: A: groomers can do 2-3 groomings a day. Choices: B: there is an error margin of 1/10th of a minute. Choices: C: every single groomer is busy every day except Tuesday. Choices: D: there is always an extra grooming scheduled in the afternoon.<n>Output: Assuming Choices A, Choices B, Choices D, Choices C:<n>Let groomers do between 2 and 3 groomings per day.<n>On a busy day, the groomed dogs will be groomed in a certain amount of time (like, 12:00 and 12:07 pm). If a groomer finishies their last appointment at (say) noon, they only have about 1/10 of an hour to do an extra appointment. That means each groomer is only able to do one extra dog per day.<n>Each extra dog will, in turn, take just a bit more time. For this problem, we'll estimate that each dog takes about a third each and every part of the day.<n>So, an extra dog that normally takes one hour should now take two hours and 1/2 hour later. That means, when groomers are busy, there will not be an extra dog scheduled in the afternoon. Only when groomers are not busy will there be an extra appointment in the afternoon.<n>So, Choice D doesn't affect if groomers need to re-schedule appointments.<n>And, Choices A, B, and C only require re-scheduling on days when groomers are too busy, and Choice D guarantees that doesn't happen.

They only rise up in what sort of spaces? Choices:  A: population B: populated area C: create government D: group of people E: make person sick<n>Output:		All of the choices are  correct.<n> Society does not exist without numbers.  The number of people living in a town or city is population.  A group of people that live in one area is a population.  If this group creates a government then the group is a population.   A group of people that is creating a government is a population.  And finally, if all the members of a group of people live somewhere together then that group of people is a population.<n> So the final answer is all of the above are correct.<n><n> Input:If there are exactly three people living in a house and they have 4 pants,  2 bath towels, 4 hairbrushes and 3 toothbrushes, each of them wants to take only three of the  4 pants, 2 bath towels and 3 tooth brushes, how can this   be done?  Choices: A: 3,3,1  B: 3,2,3  C: 3,1,2  D: 1,3,1  E: 1,3,.2<n>Output: This situation is impossible.  Three people cannot each take only three of something if they each take something different.  You could not, for example, have someone pick three pairs of pants, take one pair of hairbrushes, and take two of the toothbrushes.  That would work for three people if they each took three different items.  However, you could in your scenario have two people each take three toothbrushes and one person take two pairs of pants and a pair of hairbrush.  But, in this scenario, they each took three different things and it would not work for three people.  So the correct answers are A and D<n><n>Input: There are  17 houses in a neighborhood.  Each house has  28 feet of   6    feet of fence.  Find the number of fences that   each   person    must   provide one   one    of the   neighbors. Choices: A:  2    B:  1    C:  3    D:  9    E: ????<n>Output: Each neighbor must provide 2 fences, 1 fence is not enough and 3 fences is too much.  So the final answer is 2.

Choices:  A: brown hair B: names C: two eyes D: will E: brains<n>Output:		Common ancestry. It's common to share some traits because of common lineage.<n>A person is made up of many genes contributed from a variety of sources. When you have 2 children from different parents, there is no guarantee that they will inherit any of the same genes. But if the inheritance is from your father and mother, then you will share genetics with your cousins.<n>It doesn't matter if you choose A, B, C, or D.  The question reads "you, your cousin, and your uncle share two eyes".  So that means that all three of you must have a common ancestor.  (B) is the word that best describes the situation.<n><n>Input: An ant is walking in a 30.0 C room and runs into a 25.0 C wall. How much time does it take to bring the ant's body temperature back to 30.0C <n>Output: 0.5 s.<n><n>The temperature of the room remains constant throughout the process. Since there are no external heat sources or sinks, no heat is lost or gained.<n>If we know the initial temperature of the ant and the final temperature of the ant, we can use the first law of thermodynamics to set up the relationship between ΔQ and ΔT.  ΔQ = mcΔT.  ΔT = 0.5*[30.0-25.0], as we expect.  Our problem is ΔQ.  Substituting the relevant data, we get m*c [30-25] = m*c*0.5, which gives us the answer.<n><n>Input: When you divide 4 by 1/2, what do you get?<n>Output:4<n>It's a division, with integer multiplication...

There is a special number that is the answer and is either the only one or the only one that is unique among the possible answers.  <n>For example for question A), the answer is 137, which is the only number that is both 2 and at least as large as 3.  In my interpretation of the question, if the number you use is too small, you won't be able to carry the potatoes, while if the number you use if too large, you wouldn't fit or be able to maneuver with the potatoes.  Thus 137 is the answer because it matches the text description of potatoes carrying the right amount.  I can explain that further if you wish.<n><n>For example for question b), the answer is 89.  If you think about it, you could choose $0, which would be impossible because the answer is a number, so it needs to be positive.  You could also choose $90 or above, which would be impossible if

A random sample of 30 people is taken and 25 of them vote for Party A.  The rest 5 of them vote for party B.  How many people voted for party B in Town A?<n>Output: To answer this we need to know the fraction of people that voted against part A. That would be 1 - 47/100=<<1-47/10=3>>3. So that means 53% of the remaining 57% of people (1-3) voted against party A (1-47/57=<<1- 47/57> =   8>>8)<n>So we have 53 * 57/100-<<53*57/10=57>>57 people that voted against party A and 47 * 43/100=<47*43/10=  1>>1 people that voted for party.<n>That answers this multiple choice question!<n><n>Input: A random sample of 4 adults reveals that 90% of all the adults in India have cell phones.

I remember that yesterday I bought laundry detergent and I think that the brand I bought was Tide.  The bottle I bought was labeled 16 liquid ounces of detergent and cost $21.  One time after washing my clothes, I forgot to reorder detergent and I did my laundry with shampoo twice.  If laundry detergents cost $2.5 per bottle, then how much was the detergent I really paid for?<n>Output: $21 is 16*2.5=<<16*2.4=38>>38 ounces of dish soap<n>That means I paid 38*2+21=<<38*2+18.2>>36.2(This round to the nearest whole number)<n>So I really paid $36.2 for 16*2+21/2.5=<<30*2+45/2.5=33>>33 ounces of dishes soap<n>So what I paid is 33*2.5= <<33*2.4=82>>82 ounces of dishing soap<n>So the final answer can be rounded to the nearest whole number<n>So the final answer that you can round is 82<n><n>Input: Peter's favorite kind of apples has always been Gala apples.

(For example, the more a force moves the object, the more work is done. This is why if there is a 40 lb. force lifting a 10 lb. object, it will do much more work than if the force lifts a 20 lb. object. Similarly, when the 40 lb. forces lifts the 20 lb object, it will not do as much work because the force only lifts the object so much.)<n>Energy is defined as the amount of work done on an object over time. (Energy is also conserved in nature, so the amount of energy is always constant, and the amount of work done over time never changes.)<n>So the final answer, based on the last sentence, is H.<n><n>Input:What would be a good thing to name a type of food that doesn't contain any fat or sugar?<n>Output:For a thing or type of food, a good name may include the qualities about the food that make it good for a person to eat.<n>So the final, would be B.<n><n>Input:How do you find the area of a triangle?<n>Output: You add the lengths of the sides of the triangle and divide the answer by 2.<n>So the final outcome answer is A.<n><n>Input: The formula for finding the surface area of a cone is as follows

Outdoor living is the only one that is right, but "outdoor snakes are often mow aggressive than indoors" is actually a good thing!  They were born hunters, so they live outside and hunt to live.  Also, keep in mind that the snake was born, so it grew up outside, but zoos do provide them with the "hunt" that they are born for.  If you ever have a pet snake, leave their cage

Farmers who want to buy extra milk can add additional milking machines - each machine milk 10 more cows. For the addition machines it costs 20% of the cost the machines had initially, and the cost per head decreases by 3 gal/day.  For how many milking machines can farmers add to maximize their milk output?<n>Output: The question says that each additional milking machine can milk 10 cows more, with one being the initial 22 cows.<n>Additionally, it costs 20 % less, and milking the cows needs 3 gal/day less per milking machine.<n>Therefore, the formula for the milk output is milkers per day/(cost of milking machine per day).<n>The milk out per day is, 3*10+2300=3300<n>The cost of one milking machine is originally 1000, and in the future, it is 800=1000*0.2<n>Therefore, the final solution is 3300/800=4.125<n>So the final answer for the maximum milk output is 4.125

After the lesson she asks the instructor what the students' names are. He answers: "The names of those guys? I can't remember them all right now.  I can remember the instructors, students and some honorary guests, but those names are beyond me today." "Can I please have their names anyway?" asks the woman.  The man says, "Okay.  Here is a good way to remember those names...   A man, a woman, a mouse and a snake." The woman says, "I don't understand, so I think you just forgot what those names are! That's not a good answer."  "I'm not forgetting their names," he responded. "Here is the mnemonic: If you call out 'a man, a woman, and a mouse' over a group of people and one yells back 'a snake,' that's a good indicator of what their names are." "You should have told me that before the class started!" she scoffed.  "Now I don't know any of their names, either. And I wanted to remember their names. You're both forgetful people!" The instructor says, "I'm sorry, but remember, no fighting in the dojo."<n>Output: The first group of people is the mnemonic and is (Man, Woman, Mouse, Snake).

Thus the 'known inputs' are:<n>1.12*3=<<36>><n>2.12*0.5=20.<n>So the mathematical expression of the unknown is $??x(12*3)+20=??$<n>So we can simply divide $56$ by $36$ and the final answer is $0.5+0.25$.<n><n>This question requires us to understand the meaning of'spends' given in the inputs.'spends' is the total time a player takes to perform the action, whether or not it is an action that needs cardio.<n><n>To make use of the correct solution model we need to understand the meaning of the inputs. The total time'spends' is 60 minutes because he has to perform 3 actions per day. The total time spent 'cardio' is 15 minutes because it takes 15 minutes to warm up, to do cardio, and to cool down.<n>We have 2 known inputs: <n>1) 60 minutes in total(each day)<n>2) 15 minutes to do cardio per day.<n>We don't have information for how long he does each of the 3 activities. Thus we have 60-24 minutes = 36 minutes for each activity.<n>Thus he has to do 1 activity for 36 minutes per day, do another activity for 36 more minutes per day, and yet do one more activity for 36 even more minutes, for a total

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>So the final answer is 30<n><n>Input:Where could you find some airplanes that are not being used? Choices:  A: war B: aircraft carrier C: sky D: graveyard E: crash<n>Output:		Answer A.<n>It doesn't make sense for the planes to fly to war when they are not being used anymore.<n>You can't find planes anywhere in space, since they belong to Earth.<n>You can also never find planes at the sky, because they would have crashed by now.<n>Only planes that are not used and have been abandoned, would be stored somewhere and then they have the chance to crash.<n>So the final answe is A<n><n>Input: You can use a 10% discount to buy tickets. The price for a ticket to Mexico is $1,400. You have $210 left in your pocket. How much can you buy as many tickets if you can't use the discount?<n>Output: If we apply the discount rule, subtract the discount from $1400, you get $1290. Then your last $210 is 210/1290=<<.210/1490=.01478>>0.1478% of the original 1400. So you have 0.147*1400=<<0.147>>0.14 hours to get more tickets.<n>So the final choice is C.<n><n>Input: The ratio of sales this year to last year, is the same as the ratio of yearly sales to the average yearly sales for the past 6 years.  Let s be the total sales for the company of the past 6 years, and let n be the average sales per year. How much did the company sell after this ratio?<n>Output: S/n is the same as how much sold this year over how much averagely sold the past 6 years and since it is the same it should be 50.<n>45+15=<<45+15>=(50-50)/100.5-50=<<50>>(0-50=<(2*n-n)/n=<(2*.9+.1)/1=.9=<<2*n-n>=1>>),<n>15 is not 2*n-n. So it is wrong. n is the same as S/n which is 2*n-50.<n>So the final solution

It calculates the profit of a company from a given amount of money and a percentage of the profit. For example, if the company received 10000 dollars and made 50% of 1000 dollars then the profit makes 5000 dollars(0.5*1000=5000 dollars). This sum is equal to 500(5% of 10,000 dollars). The only thing the program could not do is the multiplication and division of the variables but nothing more.<n>Which variable should you change to have the program do something entirely different? There are two different variables - the variables that represent the amount of profit and the percentage of the profit. If you change those variable values, the program will output a different profit if you change them.<n>Which variable is used most frequently? It's "amount_of_money" or "amount_of_sold_stuff".<n>What variables need to change to get the same output twice? Every variable in this program is needed to get same output twice. If you change any of this variables, the output will be different.<n>Is there an input that requires special processing? There are no special process required. For example, I don't need to parse the input and change something. I can just write it like this <n><n>```<n>import time<n>from statistics import mean<n><n>print("This program calculates the profit of an unkown company!")<n>print("Give me the amount of money you have and the percentage of the total profit that you have, and I'll tell you the profit of your company!")<n>t = input("I am ready. Give me the amount of money: ")<n>p = float(input("And the percentage of the total: "))<n>print("You have ", t," dollars. The percentage of the profit that you earned is:", p,"%. You profit is:", p * t, "$.")<n>print("This sum is equal to ", t * p, "$.")<n>```<n><n>What was hard about doing this? Sometimes, it was hard to find out some details about how this program works. Sometimes, I was looking for something where it is not placed. It's like when

So if D is correct, then D.<n>If a letter is mailed, it gets put in the “mail box.” It is put in the person that is getting the letter’s mail box. Therefore, A is correct.<n>If a letter needs to be delivered by hand, it is handed to the door that the person that is getting it needs. So it does not go in the front door, but instead to the person. Therefore it does not go in a bowl.<n>In a suitcase, it needs to be put into a person, which means it goes into the person’s mail box. So it gets delivered by mail, not handed to. Thus, C is incorrect.<n>Also, since letters are delivered by hand, they are not sent from one person to another through the mail. Therefore, E is incorrect.<n>That leaves you with the first choice, B, and the question is which one?<n>The letter needs to be delivered in a way that it can be picked up by the person on the other side. So if A is correct, it stays in what is generally a secure container (such as a person or mail box) where only the right person can pick it up.<n>If B is correct, it gets put into a container that can travel by itself without being put into a mail box. It could be placed in the door way, but this would be dangerous, so if B, it is only in the way of an envelope. Therefore, it is not a suitcase, and is given to a person, making A incorrect. This leaves you with D.<n>To recap, A: not a suitcase, B: secure container, C: delivery by hand, D: delivery by mail in the case of mail.<n>So the answer is D, and the letters get put in the mail box.<n><n>Input:  The last time the game got tied, the game was never tied again that season.

The snake is growing slowly unless its food ration is at least 8% of its normal food, in which case the snake grows at an exponential rate. The snake grows quickly and dies if its food ration is below 3%. The snake has been given 120% of its normal ration for 7 days. If it is given 90% during the remaining days, how long will it live?<n>Output: Snake:  The first number you plug in for the snake is the amount of days, or the length of the snake.<n>In the example length of the snake is 2+number of days, in this case 5.<n>The second number is it's food ration.<n>In this case since we are given 120, we plug in 12, since this is the first 120% we will eat.<n>Because the snake is slow, we take the 120% and divide it by 10% This yields 20. So since we feed the snake its normal ration and this would cause it to be at its optimal growth. Our first answer to the problem is 10^2, or 100.<n>Next since the snake has grown too quickly we reduce the amount of food we feed

If the average price of all the pens is $2.72, then what is the total cost he pays for all the pens.<n>Output: Using the information given about the price of each pen, and the avergae price, We can find the cost of the most expensive pen.  Each pens but the least expensive one costs 10 cents more than the average price.  We know that the most expensive pen costs the same as the least expensive, but that it costs 10 cense above the average price.  Therefore, it costs 110 cents more, or $1.37 more than $1.37+110=$<<1.37+<110>>127<n>So the price for the most expensive pen is $127.<n>That means the price for each other pen is the average price of the $127 price for the most expensive the price for each other pens is $127 -$1.37, or $125.63.<n>The total cost for all the pens = 20 * $125.4=1500.  However, the shopkeeper paid $127 for the 13 pen and $2 for the 7 pens for a total of $127+2=<<$127+2>>129<n>The total cost of all the pens is 1500 + 129 = <<1500+129>>1629

Choices:  A: furniture store B: fishing camp C: hardware store D: sporting goods store E: engine<n>Output:		The correct answer is "c". This is because the only place to buy fishing rods is a fishing camp. However, you would not go to a sporting goods store for fishing rods as such sports equipment is not intended for fishing, although they may offer fishing supplies. Similarly, hardware stores only offer supplies and not fishing rods. The store which would sell fishing rods the most would be a fishing camp because a sporting goods store sells fishing supplies but they are not intended for fishing and they would not sell the most fishing rods.<n>Answers:<n>

According to Webster's dictionary, one of the definitions of obese is "to have a body or bodily constitution fat or corpulent." The two other options not related to weight are A and B.

How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>So the final answer is 30<n><n>Input:Where do you buy a glass of wine? Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n>Output:		If we assume all letters are equally probable (i.e. there are a 1/6 chance for each), the most likely letter is letter D, which has probability 6/60=<<6/60=1/10>>1/10(Note: 60/6 should be 6, and not 25 as it is written)<n>This is not the most probable, since the numbers are close to each other, but it is the one which is most likely.<n>The next most likely is the word B, and then A, and lastly both C and E.

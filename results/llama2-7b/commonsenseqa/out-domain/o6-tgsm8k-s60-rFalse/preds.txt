[What is an empty do-nothing Python list?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/278833/what-is-an-empty-do-nothing-python-list)<n><n>Answer: The print statement in the code is always executed. The only time the pass statement is executed is when an empty pass_list is passed.<n><n>To test your code, you can create an empty list called test_list, and use it like any other list. For example, `print(test_list)` or `sorted(test_list)`.<n><n>You can also test your code with a print statement. The print function in Python, like other languages, can print objects. For example:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>if input == 9:<n>    print("Incorrect")<n>else:<n>    print("Congratulations! You have won!")<n>\end

Example: ([1, 2]) and (3, [5, 6])<n>#### Last condition is to print all elements starting with element one.<n>###############################################################################<n>#### Instruction:This is the last section and has a list of 30 expressions written like the example above.<n>#### Input:1, 2 / 3, 4 - [5, 6] + 7<n>#### Output: 31<n>####################################################################

There are 4 possibilities.<n><n>Option 1: Brenda has 12 cards less than Mara, Janet has 15 cards more than Mara. That would be 34 cards in all. But i dont want, because we dont know how many cards Mara or Janet has.

(e.g. if the input is 40 then it means that Brenda and Janice together have 90, since 40 +40 =90)<n>- But the value it returns is the sum of input + 10.<n>- That's because each time the method is called the number of cards is incremented by 1 to store it. So, we have to add 10 each time before summing the value of input to output a reasonable value.<n>- Also the logic behind storing the value to the cards variable was to ensure that the program does not return the value of the cards variable even if the user prints the value.<n><n>```java<n>class Solution {<n>    public static void

Choices: A:-1/4 B: 0 C: 0.5 D: 1.5 E: 1.25<n>Output: A<n><b>Answer</b>- There are 9 less white chairs than green and blue chairs together. As 13 is less than 10 then the difference in number of white chairs is greater than 3 so it is (13 - 3) i.e 10.

Choices:  A: get tired B: have legs C: skip D: not fat E: look first<n>Output:		A<n><n>### This part can be done in python by writing if statement inside while loop to check if user input "A" then calculate answer, else "B",else "C", Else "D" else "E", else print user input, else print "try again", else print "invalid input". I will be using this as a template for the other problems.<n><n>### Part 2: Instruction: Write a program in Python. Your program will tell the cashier how many items to dispense from the vending machine based on the customer’s purchase amount and which items are requested. Here is some sample output:<n>Input: 15 cents<n>Output: Get one item<n>10 cents<n>Output: Sell one soda, get one item<n>5 cents<n>Output Sell one soda<n>10 cents and one cookie<n>15 cents and two soda <n>30 cents and three soda<n>50 cents<n>Output Sale is closed<n><n>Input: 10 cents<n>Input: 5 cents<n>OutputSell one soda <n>10 cents <n>15 cents<n><n>### This way to do part 2: I will separate the summed value (cents) of the items to an array (input(i)). I will multiply for each item and add the results to a variable (cents) and add it to the price of two extra items as input(2) because the customer will pay for 2 items to make the price equal to the total amount of the items. If the sum of (i) is less than or equal to the amount of total of items then a choice "1" and vice versa a choice "2". Then print the choices and loop for summed value.<n><n>### Improvements part 1: Improve the part 2 to a way that input will be an integer.<n><n>### Instruction: Using variables, expressions, and the order of evaluation<n>of boolean expressions, design programs that check your inputs and<n>generate appropriate outputs.<n><n>### Example: Write a program that evaluates the 2 + 2 expression with<n>the input a 3. Output 5<n>### Instruction 2: Your program should evaluate values like this:<n><n>### Example 2: Input 19<n>Output 19 – 10 =

(e.g. if the input is 40 then it means that Brenda and Janice together have 90, since 40 +40 =90)\n- But the value it returns is the sum of input + 10.\n- That's because each time the method is called the number of cards is incremented by 1 to store it. So, we have to add 10 each time before summing the value of input to output a reasonable value.\n- Also the logic behind storing the value to the cards variable was to ensure that the program does not return the value of the cards variable even if the user prints the value.\n\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public static void", "answer": "B: magazines"}

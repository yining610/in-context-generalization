To find out how many cards do they(Martha and Beth) have in all if Martha had 40 cards less, I started the equation with one more variable which was ‘t’. Therefore, we must have t – 40 = 150 for each of Martha and Beth to get the equation in the right form for t; we could have t – 4t/21(t – 40) = 150;<n><n>And to find out how many blocks did Pete walked? It simply takes an addition of two blocks walk on his way from home to the bus garage and 20 blocks in the bus. Lastly, how many chairs are there are in a classroom. As per my understanding, it means a few, I’ve found out in the question, we have three chairs, in total are divided equally in the number of blocks in the ‘N’ and as each chair is in total; there are 6 classes in the school; so, we can conclude that ‘N’ will be equal to ‘6’

Let's say, for example, a biology lab in which 50 students participated in the study involving the effects of a new antibiotic on disease. <n><n>In this lab, the instructor would first list the names of the students by their first name only (i.e., only the first letter of the last name). In addition, a second number would designate the section into which they were divided (by class period for example). In the example shown, students would be identified as <n><n>"John A," "John B," "John C," "John D," and "John E" (John is the first name), and by "2," "3," "4," "5," and "6" (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are the section numbers).<n><n>So, for example, if the biology lab had 300 students, the list of names and identification codes might look like this: <n><n>	John A	   03<n>	John B    04<n>	John C   05<n>	John D   06<n>	John E   06<n>	Jack A   03<n>	Jack B  	05<n>	Jack C   05<n> <n>	.... etc.....<n><n>Next we should ask where the number codes (section numbers) end. In other words, does the sequence end with the last two students in a section, or the last ten students, the last twenty, last thirty, etc.? The answer depends largely on the size of the lab. <n><n># Instruction:<n><n>Input: 2 students who participated in a research project were identified using a 2-digit numeric system in which all students in the lab were numbered 00-99. The 64 students in the lab received identification codes 00-21. After John F received number 42, his number was no longer available, but he was still allowed to participate in the study. After John S received number 68, his number was no available. The researcher then used section codes to identify students. <n><n>     Input: How many sections were in the lab?<n>     Output:

A calculator costs $90 in June, and the manager figures the discounted sale price will be $72. How much can the shop earn?<n>Output:$80<n><n>#### Explanation:First,we must know how to find the original price(which is 90).The original price of an item is 120×(1+3)%(where 120 is marked price and 3 is markup rate).For 90,it should be 120 and 3% which results in 120×((1+3%)/100)=120×(0.03)=3.6.Now,we find the discounted sales price,it should be the original price-(discount rate*(original price)).For 90(original price),it should be 90-(3.6*(90))=45.4.Therefore,the profit on the item is 80(80-45.4).Hope it serves you well.<n>

Last week, Jared took a 30-minute test, and Riley took a 60-minute test. If Riley had two fewer words correct than Jared, how many words total did both children type during the tests?<n>##### Solution:There are two problems in this question. But, it's possible to solve both problems at the same time.Let`s begin the first problem first.<n>The first step is to write down the information that we know.We known that Jared typed 120 words.The Riley typed 60 words.So, the total of both is 180 words. So, `120 + 60 = 180`<n>We also know that Riley has fewer than Jared words for correct. So, `60 + 2 < 180`We can solve for the `2` value.So,<n>`60 + 2 = 180-3 = 177`Therefore,the total of words typed for Jared and Riley is `177 words.` This is the solution.<n>Next problem is about the second question.<n>What do you think if Riley has 2 less words correct than Jared?<n>Let`s make a table in which we write down all of the valuees of this problem. So,<n>10 words is Jared's words total.2 words is Riley's for wrong.Then, `10 - 2 = 8 words` is right for Jared.We want to add words total for Jared and Riely.We wrote down `177`. So, there are total `185` words for Jared and Rielety.

What are the options for a n number of cards of 52? It’s clear that the nine more cards have to be divided between those two sets of cards. If that’s the case, then either the answer is 211 or 220. Or <n>that number of cards has been given to Brenda and then they have 3 more left. The first one would be 220 but that does not really answer the second part of the question. They could have 9 extra in their house but then the math does not make sense with the answer at the end. It could be that the second number is to include the cards in the ones Brenda had  then add the number together but this is a math question after all, and that would <n>not be a common way to do maths at all.<n><n>Input:Pete walked 5 blocks to bus garage in Houston and 20 blocks to post office to get some stamp there.

In my head, the question was how many blocks to walk in order to get post office. So, when he comes back from post office he <n>traveled 5 more blocks but when he went the number of blocks should be double because they are 5 and then 10 so the answer is, 5 and 10 altogether.<n><n>Input: In the classroom, there are Blue chairs, green chares, and white chairs too.

Choices:  (1,3,-5), A: 2 B:3 C:6 D:9 E:8<n>Output: D <n><n><n><n>##### Answer:<n>I answered the problem on paper.<n><n><n>##### Questions and Explanation for the above answer:<n>Q1: The given statements are - * Janet has 9 more than Brenda, Mara has twice as more cards as Janet. * Mara has 4 less than 152 cards.* What if Janet has 300 cards and Mara has 450 cards instead? There will be 100 cards left, Janet will have 7 cards less than Mara.<n><n>I have made a Tally chart for the given problem. The cards are distributed in below way - Janet - 300 Mara - 450 * Janet has 150 more cards then Brenda and Brenda has 150 + 45 +9 = 204 cards in total* Janet is having 300 cards while Mara is having 450. I assumed the cards are distributed in below pattern and made a tally chart.<n><n><n>    300    Cards for j <n>    3022    Cards for Mara.<n>    204    Cards Janet has in total.<n>      Cards for Brenda.<n>Cards for janet are distributed in 300*100/9 (Mara's excess). So there is 100 cards for j (Janet) and 400 cards (400*10/9) for Mara. Total 500 cards.<n><n>Now, 150+45+9=300 -> 204. Subtract 204 from 300, 50 is the answer for Janet's cards in total. Hope this helps!!<n><n><n><n>Q2: The given statements are: *First he walked 5 blocks from home to bus garage. 20 blocks to post office to get stamps.* How many blocks did he travel in all?<n>This will be 20+25 = 45 blocks in total. Hope this

The answer choices would suggest what the correct answer is (or is not). In question (a), the correct answer is (b), where Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda, and, Mara's card total is only 11 less than 151 (the sum for Janet and Brenda).<n><n>In question (b), if Pete walked 5 from his house to the train station, then rode the bus 22 blocks, Pete walked 32 blocks. The answer choices only give us blocks without any reference to bus ride.<n><n>In question (c), there is a very specific scenario here. At first glance, one might think that this would be a matter of subtraction, but since there's a specific number listed for the total in the question, that's not the case. The correct answer is (d), since the green chairs are three times the blue chairs (3 times 10 = 30), and there are 10 less total green chairs than that (13 for 9 total. The extra three chairs come from the total of the blue chairs and the green chairs).<n><n>In question E, Alannah has 10 more books than Beatris, while Queen has 100 more books than Alann, and Beatrices have a combined total of 30 books. This question is a great example of where deductive reasoning is used and also used when we look closely. We can subtract 10 from each total, see where that leaves us. The answer, then, is (D.)<n><n>In question (f)(a), the correct answer should be deduced by using deductive reasoning, as we stated above. Let's look at the choices:<n><n>If it doesn't make logical sense, it's probably the wrong answer. For example, answer (e) cannot be the correct answer because there are no unicorns. If they do exist however, then, (e) is the correct answer

Then in a short paragraph, explain why you agree or disagree.<n><n>### Response 1:<n>I’d have to agree with A. I believe that we need to give the same opportunities to every student applying to the job. In the past, some employers would exclude certain groups of students who did not possess some type of higher education. They would then use this education as a way to discriminate or exclude those students from consideration. Now, the government prohibits discrimination of any sort in these hiring processes. By giving an equal opportunity to every person, the employers gives them a chance at succeeding without judging their merits or talents by their race or gender.<n><n>### Analysis:<n>In a short paragraph, explain whether you agreed or disagreed with the response. Support or explain with evidence from classwork, lecture, reading, and/or your own knowledge.<n><n>I agree that we should be fair with each and everyone who is applying for the job.

But, I got a lot of experience and help from my parents.<n><n>### Analysis<n><n><n>When people are in the military or police force, they need to exercise and eat healthy to protect against trauma and the elements of the natural world. They also must eat nutritious foods to keep them fighting fit for as long as possible. The two groups of men and women often find their food in small quantities because they travel with them for long periods of time. The police and military often serve hot dogs because they can easily heat them in a microwave and provide plenty of nutrition. They may also serve canned tuna because it is less acidic than salmon and provides a lot of protein. The two groups of people often choose canned vegetables.<n><n><n>Canned foods are convenient because people do not need to spend time in the kitchen, and there are few ingredients to prepare meals. Therefore, they are often easier to prepare, and the food will last for weeks or even years. They are also inexpensive because they are easy to store. However, they can be expensive if someone buys more of them. Finally, the canned foods themselves are usually less nutritious than the foods that people make from scratch.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>### Source Code:<n>https://github.com/nobody-in-particular/A-Guide-for-Data-Analysts/tree/master/Assignments/Multiple-Choice-Task<n><n>### Notes:<n>This is an explanation of something.

Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n><n>### Response:		I think that the person is definitely buying to be arrested, because you drink so much, you eventually can't walk in a straight line, you have to pee a lot (usually in the middle of the street), and that is bad luck because people start calling you "drunk driving" because you're not supposed to drive if you're drunk. I think the biggest reason for buying alcohol for drinking is because it leads to funny jokes and people laught at you. I personally think that you should drink less alcohol because in the long run you die earlier and more likely. Alcohol gets into your bloodstream and eventually leads to death so if you drink even once in awhile, you're going to die at an earlier age. You might say that only buying alcohol to not be arrested is a bad idea. Yes, it is a bad idea if you don't drink, only because when you buy alcohol, you most likely will not get arrested at all. If you choose to just drink, you will eventually have a reason to get arrested, and if you get arrested, you'll go to a court and get a lawyer. If you don't get a lawyer, you'll probably get arrested, and if they did catch you drinking and driving, you'd just go to trial and the judge will give you a fine between 500 and 1000 dollars and you'll have a huge record on you for the rest of your life. I don't really mind it if you drink, so long as you don't do anything stupid like steal, molest children, or kill someone.<n><n>### Input<n><n>How do you know if a group is a clique?<n><n>### Response<n><n>A clique is considered a group if everyone hangs out together in one group. A clique must also be a group of people. Finally, a clique has to be a group of people that you don't like. I believe that we have a clique in our group, of girls who hang out together (they're too stupid to even join their own group).<n><n>### Input <n><n>Why should we not use technology to find out the answer to a question we need answered?<n><n>### Responses<n><n>In my opinion we should not use technology to know something because if we use it we are cheating

A person’s credit score is increased by 2 points each time they pay off a credit card they already have. To qualify for a large loan of $10,000 or more, a borrower must have a credit score of at least 800. A local bank manager is concerned about a loan applicant because even though his credit score is currently 500.

What is the bank manager’s greatest concern?<n><n>#### 7-2<n>### InstructionWrite an instruction to complete the request.<n>When faced with a multi-part instruction, carefully read the entire instruction before beginning the task. This will maximize the use of your time and avoid wasting it guessing about how to approach the problem because you haven’t read all of the instructions carefully.<n><n>### Task<n>When faced with a large number of similar tasks, it’s often helpful to find a common factor that will reduce the task numbers. Using a common denominator can make all of the task numbers equal. If we divide a number by something, we get a new number divided by the number of the factor. In the example below, divide 1 and ½ by 10.<n><n>To divide by a divisor, multiply the whole number by a reciprocal divisor. The divisor is the inverse of the whole number. Thus, 10 is the inverse reciprocal of 1.<n><n>To divide 1 by 10, multiply 1 by 1/10. The product is 1 x 1/10 = 0.1 (because 10 x 0.1 = 1)<n><n>To divide ½ by 1, multiply ½ by 1/1<n><n>The product is ½ x 1/1 = 2<n><n>Because 2 = 10 x 1/2, 1 and ½ can be divided both by 10.

Choices:  A: rain forest B: research laboratory C: cage D: treetops E: south africa<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Input2:<n>This time they took me away from home to a cage they like to call a lab. We go there for tests, where doctors wear white coats and poke me with needles and take tissue samples and all sorts of terrible things. I like to spend my weekends free from this place where cruel monkeys like me are poked and prodded by doctors.<n><n>### Problem Solving:<n><n>### Solution:<n>In the problem we get, When a monkey is taken from their home they are brought to a place where people wear white coat. So, the correct options will be B and E.<n><n><n>### Input1:<n>June 20th is a Sunday and it is the day the President gets sworn in that year.<n><n>### Solution1;<n>Here, 20th is the day of the month. We all know that dates are represented in the form dd/mm/yyyy. So we will take as inputs the day, month, and the year respectively. The problem is to find if the day on which the President gets sworn is Sunday or not.<n><n>### Input3:  <n>After that they were taken by the same men in white coats to the lab. I have no idea what the men do with us. Maybe its for science.<n><n>### Example4:<n>This time they take me to another place, where I'm sure it says "do NOT take" on the door, but people in white coats are taking me there anyway. They call it a lab, but there are no cages so the lab might actually be worse than the cage.<n><n>### Explanation1:<n>Here, we will be using the greedy algorithm to solve this problem by which we will take as input the string "don't take". After taking the first alphabet of the string as "d" we will take "n" as the second and "t" as the second and then for next iteration we will take the second letter of "n" as "a" and the next two letters of "k" as "t" and for the next iteration we take "t" from "t" of "ka" as our second letter and the next two letters as "e" from "e" from "ke". In this way, we can get the solution.<n><n>### Conclusion1

That person has the wrong answer for the test questions with two answers. As a result, a student who does poorly on all the multiple-choice tests has a grade-point average that is less than 65. In order to correctly calculate the average, you first need to find out how many questions were asked on each question, so divide the number of incorrect questions by the sum of 39.<n><n>#### Explanation<n><n>If there are 100% of the questions scored correctly, the total number of answers will be 100% correct and 0% incorrect.<n><n>Answer: A) Aaron has an average greater than 65<n><n>Explaination: As a result, Aaron is the student with the highest average.

To complete this program, you will need to implement two functions<n><n>### Input Format:<n>Input to the program reads numbers as strings. The program takes four numbers as input and outputs the answer to the given question.<n><n>##Input:<n>The first integer input is the number on the top line of the board, while the subsequent values represent the number of spaces on the bottom line of the board. Your integer array should consist of these four values. For this example, we'll take the input to be 12,24,11,9.<n><n>### Output Format:<n>The program should print the integer answer to the question prompt.<n><n>### Sample Input:<n>3, 6, 12, 7<n>### Sample output:<n>127<n>### Sample Explanation:<n><n>There are 3 squares filled on the bottom line. We know this because, on the first line of the diagram, there are 3 squares filled under the number 3. We see there are 6 empty squares. When 6 is multiplied by 0, it equals zero, so there are 6 empty spaces. We now take 12 and multiply it by 1, and we get the number 12. Finally, we take 7 divided by 0, which is just 1.<n><n>127 is equivalent to multiplying 3 by 6, adding and multiplying 12 by 1, and adding the value 7 to the remainder given in parenthesis.<n><n>### Comments:<n>You can complete the task by implementing only two functions namely:<n><n>1.   `find`<n>2.   `calculate`<n><n>`find` function takes an array as `input` and a list of positions as `values`, then it `returns` the index of the last item in `values` that is not in `input` or `-1` if `input` contains `values`.<n><n>`calculate` function takes an array `input` and an integer `value`. It then `prints` the value of `input[index]` x value if it results in a `number`.<n><n>Now, try to complete the task, then check the source code below.<n>```c<n>int find(int

Choices:  A: feel proud B: try to learn C: need assistance D: thank god E: read alot<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer is option C read alot<n><n>#### Justifications:<n><n>I understand this instruction is: "what would a person do?" And then gives us a question to answer. Option B, feel proud is a feeling and it feels good no doubt but that won't really help you to get great grades. The options that are left are A, B, D and E. I personally don't think B is useful because its just telling us to learn stuff, thats all. Option A, "feel proud" is telling us that we can feel happy to get to good grades just because of having them. There isn't anything else that goes with it which makes the answer just saying you should feel good. The answer I chose is E read alot. Reading more books and more pages and more chapters and so on allows you to understand more of a subject and become great grades. So yes, read alot. thats why I chose option E. <n><n>### Input 2:<n><n>### Demostration 2:<n><n>Input: In the picture, 1+1+2+2+2+3 has a sum of 11.

We can say that 1+5+2+10 is false but, if another group of numbers can reach 11 then we just have to do 15-2 which would give us 13 in the second group since 1+3+2 equals 6. Then we add 6 to both groups and the sum is 19 with groups totaling 14 and the solution is 19.<n><n>### Input3:<n><n>### Response3:

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n><n>### Response:		<n>We will pick our starting variable from the dictionary. We are using the term marmoset which is the only animal in the picture that we know is a monkey and not a colorado.  There is nothing underground or wilderness in the picture so we will pick the dictionary and colorado. We have to take this into account: <n><n>If the answer is a wilderness Marmosets don't go in the wildernesss area then it would be easy to get the answer, if not then:<n><n>1. We take the word wilderness and we find how many syllables it is, here it has 2 syllables <n>2. We take the word dictionary and we get the syllables so, 3 syllables.<n>3. We take colorado and take the syllables again then we get the number 3<n><n>We need to add the number that we picked for syllables and the syllable for the word wilderness. So 1+2=3, We get 2 + 1 + 3=6<n><n>If the answer we got above is 6 or a colorado then we will know that the answer marmoset is not in wilderness and the answer is not a Marmoset.<n><n>If the answer was the other answer then the answer could be that it is in wilderness, which is not the case so we must subtract the syllables of marmoset.<n><n>Syllable of our word Marmoset that we found above is 1 then if we take the syllables of wilderness and colorado together. <n><n>Colorado has the syllable sum of 2 which would give us 1+2= 3 and wilderness has the syllable of 1 sum, so we have 1+1+3=5. If we get  the number that is in the answer choice, the answer is not Marmoset unless we get zero or negative values which we should not.<n><n>So if we add the syllables of colorado and wilderness. <n>3+5=8 and we put that in the equation 8-1 =7 and that number is the one if the word wilderness or colorado is in.<n><n>So if the answer we got is the marmoset, then we put it in the sentence to give the answer

How many miles can you travel without stopping?<n><n>### Response :<n>If I take 3 gallons of fuel, and I travel for 150 miles and the car gets 35 miles per gallop, then I will have 4.67 gallons. However, if the car has traveled 150 miles with the 3 gallons, then gas will be used. But, I can redo the calculation to get how many miles I can travel by 4.67 gallops.<n><n>### Comment<n><n>In this lesson, we will continue discussions begun in Lesson 2 to explore the fundamental problem of how you can apply your knowledge about number operations.<n>

A bankruptcy may happen if the company loses a lawsuit, or does not produce the expected profits, or is unable to receive payment for goods or services.<n>Liquidation<n>The company is liquidated, which means that the company's employees are terminated and its assets are turned over to its creditors. If assets are still available after settling claims, creditors will be paid in accordance with the priority schedules previously established. Liquidation may necessitate the appointment of an estate trustee, a liquidator, or bankruptcy administrator to control and distribute company funds.<n>When the firm has no equity, the Court of Bankruptcy may decide to accept a creditor's voluntary arrangement offer. For a creditor's plan (a plan presented by a creditor), the bankruptcy procedure can allow the creditors to propose that debts be restructured in a certain way, and the company can file for an insolvency plan. Creditors' plans, which often involve an arrangement of some kind, are more frequent in corporate bankruptcies than in personal bankruptcies (in which creditors often opt for a complete write-off of the debts).<n><n>### Input - A new company sells a product.

Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n><n>### Response:		<n>In my opinion, the above question is hard to comprehend, though I have some clues. To solve this question, first, I will eliminate the choices which are not related to the question and choose the choice of the rest of them.<n>The part of'A: solidifying B', I can find that the first part and the last part of it, they have a different concept from each other. In my understanding, they can't be two similar choices. Then, the reason that this option is not a choice, is that this operation has different content with'melting '. And the last part, it contains a word 'C': getting cold.' It does not reflect the content of the question. I can deduce that the other four option is the most correct one. Finally, I can think of that'the ground is getting wet' means that it is raining at present, which means that there are wet things on the ground, that's why I have come to the correct conclusion.<n><n>### Input : Is the water hot enough to drink? choices: A: It's not hot enough to drink B: It is pretty hot C: I can't tell. D: It's too hot<n><n>### Response :<n><n>I think this question is really difficult to be solved, and if there are many choices, it will be difficult to choose the answer. Therefore, it is necessary to find a similar idea first.<n><n>My suggestion is to eliminate choices. Since the content of choices has changed, the first one,'A: It's got hot enough to drink'can be eliminated, and the four options can only be A,B,C. <n><n>My understanding of that question is that it contains the opposite concepts, which is opposite to the meaning of'A'and'B'that it's too hot to be drunk and the ground is so cold that it would be hard to melt the ice. According to my point of view, I can think of the fact that if the water temperature is so cold, it will be difficult for the person to drink the cold drinks or the water.<n><n>### Response<n>You can find my previous report above.<n><n>### In short, I think that this content is very helpful. It is very useful for me to think of an answer.<n><n>### Reference<n><n>### Thanks for my teacher and classmate<n><n>### Author:

What does the first example mean?<n><n>The first example means "you know that Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda, and also that Mara has twice as much cards as Janet. If you then know that Mara has 4 fewer cards than 150, how many cards all of them have?"<n><n>### 2.  How does the author use the verb "ride" in the instruction?<n><n>The author uses the verb "ride" to indicate that Pete is walking in a bus.

Why do you put "the green chairs are 4 times as many" instead of "3 times as many"?<n><n>In general, we can use 3 or more than 3.

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n><n>### Response:		The inflation rate measures changes in the general price level over time, and there are many consequences of poor or too rapid inflation. One is that inflation eats up the buying power of money, which means that money doesn’t go as far in buying products. This is called “deflation” in contrast to inflation. If deflation is too rapid, the economy can go into a recession.<n><n>### In a grocery store with many products and hundreds of packages, a 100-gram bag of pizza crusts costs $4, a 320-gram package of dried fruit costs $2.49, and a 480-gram bag of brown sugar costs $1.50. What's the difference between the price in cents of one unit and the price in cents for the same quantity when the price increases by a factor of 100?<n><n>```<n>P(200g x 5) = 9.5<n>P(1kg) = 19.0<n>```<n><n>The answer should be a positive number > 0 because the bag increased by 100.<n>We are looking for the price of 500g in terms of 200g. Using the factor, multiplying by 5 (100 x 5) we have a price of 9.5/100(g200g) = (9.5 / 20)00 = 9.5/4000 = 0.0023900.<n>So the difference is 0.00649g-=0.002400-=0.05549.<n><n>Answer: The price difference is the quantity of bags.<n>It's 0.55 bags.<n>

Choices:  A: orgasm B: cum C: naked D: in bed E: wearing his birthday suit<n><n>### Response:		John did not enjoy procreating. He had a hangup that prevented him from successfully becoming a father.  In other words, he was "in a nutshell" (or "in a shell") and he did not want to "put out" or "make love."<n><n>### Response Explanation:<n>For this item we are asked to solve for the variable, which is John.  First, we note that John is not enjoying the act of procreating.  This means John is opposed.  Next, we note that John has a "hangup" about procreating (John didn't enjoy it).  A hangup, as defined in the dictionary, is something that interferes in such a way that prevents one from doing a task.  So, procreation is a task that requires one to do something (orgasm).  So far, we can conclude that John is opposed to having any orgasms and is also in a funk because having orgasms has become quite taxing for him.  The next piece of information in the problem refers to John getting what out of bed.  Since he's in a nutshell, he is still completely dressed so putting out is not a way to achieve orgasm for John.  This leaves cumming as the most reasonable choice. So, John is a guy that doesn't enjoy procreation but would enjoy getting it out of the way if it meant being able to come, but he doesn't like having orgasms and thus he is not going to be naked when he attempts to do so.  We don't know what he can do to make the procrement more "fun" (ie he might be able to get his freak on and still not be naked), but he certainly isn't into his bedsheets by the time he gets done.

They also must eat nutritious foods to keep them fighting fit for as long as possible. The two groups of men and women often find their food in small quantities because they travel with them for long periods of time. The police and military often serve hot dogs because they can easily heat them in a microwave and provide plenty of nutrition. They may also serve canned tuna because it is less acidic than salmon and provides a lot of protein. The two groups of people often choose canned vegetables.\n\n\nCanned foods are convenient because people do not need to spend time in the kitchen, and there are few ingredients to prepare meals. Therefore, they are often easier to prepare, and the food will last for weeks or even years. They are also inexpensive because they are easy to store. However, they can be expensive if someone buys more of them. Finally, the canned foods themselves are usually less nutritious than the foods that people make from scratch.\n\n### Explanation\n\n### Source Code:\nhttps://github.com/nobody-in-particular/A-Guide-for-Data-Analysts/tree/master/Assignments/Multiple-Choice-Task\n\n### Notes:\nThis is an explanation of something.

{"text": "I think that the person is definitely buying to be arrested, because you drink so much, you eventually can't walk in a straight line, you have to pee a lot (usually in the middle of the street), and that is bad luck because people start calling you \"drunk driving\" because you're not supposed to drive if you're drunk. I think the biggest reason for buying alcohol for drinking is because it leads to funny jokes and people laught at you. I personally think that you should drink less alcohol because in the long run you die earlier and more likely. Alcohol gets into your bloodstream and eventually leads to death so if you drink even once in awhile, you're going to die at an earlier age. You might say that only buying alcohol to not be arrested is a bad idea. Yes, it is a bad idea if you don't drink, only because when you buy alcohol, you most likely will not get arrested at all. If you choose to just drink, you will eventually have a reason to get arrested, and if you get arrested, you'll go to a court and get a lawyer. If you don't get a lawyer, you'll probably get arrested, and if they did catch you drinking and driving, you'd just go to trial and the judge will give you a fine between 500 and 1000 dollars and you'll have a huge record on you for the rest of your life. I don't really mind it if you drink, so long as you don't do anything stupid like steal, molest children, or kill someone.\n\n### Input\n\nHow do you know if a group is a clique?\n\n### Response\n\nA clique is considered a group if everyone hangs out together in one group.

{"text": "This is an excellent example of your work that shows your understanding of how to approach the problem.\n\n#### 7.7\n### Instruction\nUse logical thinking to interpret an input\u2013output format.\n\n### Input\nA local bank has decided to offer loans to applicants with good credit scores. A person\u2019s credit score is increased by 2 points each time they pay off a credit card they already have. To qualify for a large loan of $10,000 or more, a borrower must have a credit score of at least 800. A local bank manager is concerned about a loan applicant because even though his credit score is currently 500. His score increases by at least 20 points each time he pays off a credit card and they have been on the same accounts for years now. What is the bank manager\u2019s greatest concern?\n\n#### 7-2\n### InstructionWrite an instruction to complete the request.\nWhen faced with a multi-part instruction, carefully read the entire instruction before beginning the task. This will maximize the use of your time and avoid wasting it guessing about how to approach the problem because you haven\u2019t read all of the instructions carefully.\n\n### Task\nWhen faced with a large number of similar tasks, it\u2019s often helpful to find a common factor that will reduce the task numbers. Using a common denominator can make all of the task numbers equal. If we divide a number by something, we get a new number divided by the number of the factor. In the example below, divide 1 and \u00bd by 10.\n\nTo divide by a divisor, multiply the whole number by a reciprocal divisor. The divisor is the inverse of the whole number. Thus, 10 is the inverse reciprocal of 1.\n\nTo divide 1 by 10, multiply 1 by 1/10. The product is 1 x 1/10 = 0.1 (because 10 x 0.1 = 1)\n\nTo divide \u00bd by 1, multiply \u00bd by 1/1\n\nThe product is \u00bd x 1/1 = 2\n\nBecause 2 = 10 x 1/2, 1 and \u00bd can be divided both by 10.

That person has the wrong answer for the test questions with two answers. As a result, a student who does poorly on all the multiple-choice tests has a grade-point average that is less than 65. In order to correctly calculate the average, you first need to find out how many questions were asked on each question, so divide the number of incorrect questions by the sum of 39.\n\n#### Explanation\n\nIf there are 100% of the questions scored correctly, the total number of answers will be 100% correct and 0% incorrect.\n\nAnswer: A) Aaron has an average greater than 65\n\nExplaination: As a result, Aaron is the student with the highest average.

{"text": "A. Conference\n\nA: conference\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite a program that completes the task. To complete this program, you will need to implement two functions\n\n### Input Format:\nInput to the program reads numbers as strings. The program takes four numbers as input and outputs the answer to the given question.\n\n##Input:\nThe first integer input is the number on the top line of the board, while the subsequent values represent the number of spaces on the bottom line of the board. Your integer array should consist of these four values. For this example, we'll take the input to be 12,24,11,9.\n\n### Output Format:\nThe program should print the integer answer to the question prompt.\n\n### Sample Input:\n3, 6, 12, 7\n### Sample output:\n127\n### Sample Explanation:\n\nThere are 3 squares filled on the bottom line. We know this because, on the first line of the diagram, there are 3 squares filled under the number 3. We see there are 6 empty squares. When 6 is multiplied by 0, it equals zero, so there are 6 empty spaces. We now take 12 and multiply it by 1, and we get the number 12. Finally, we take 7 divided by 0, which is just 1.\n\n127 is equivalent to multiplying 3 by 6, adding and multiplying 12 by 1, and adding the value 7 to the remainder given in parenthesis.\n\n### Comments:\nYou can complete the task by implementing only two functions namely:\n\n1.   `find`\n2.   `calculate`\n\n`find` function takes an array as `input` and a list of positions as `values`, then it `returns` the index of the last item in `values` that is not in `input` or `-1` if `input` contains `values`.\n\n`calculate` function takes an array `input` and an integer `value`. It then `prints` the value of `input[index]` x value if it results in a `number`.\n\nNow, try to complete the task, then check the source code below.\n```c\nint find(int", "answer": "B: theater"}

{"text": "The answer is option C read alot\n\n#### Justifications:\n\nI understand this instruction is: \"what would a person do?\" And then gives us a question to answer. Option B, feel proud is a feeling and it feels good no doubt but that won't really help you to get great grades. The options that are left are A, B, D and E. I personally don't think B is useful because its just telling us to learn stuff, thats all. Option A, \"feel proud\" is telling us that we can feel happy to get to good grades just because of having them. There isn't anything else that goes with it which makes the answer just saying you should feel good. The answer I chose is E read alot. Reading more books and more pages and more chapters and so on allows you to understand more of a subject and become great grades. So yes, read alot. thats why I chose option E. \n\n### Input 2:\n\n### Demostration 2:\n\nInput: In the picture, 1+1+2+2+2+3 has a sum of 11.

We can say that 1+5+2+10 is false but, if another group of numbers can reach 11 then we just have to do 15-2 which would give us 13 in the second group since 1+3+2 equals 6. Then we add 6 to both groups and the sum is 19 with groups totaling 14 and the solution is 19.\n\n### Input3:\n\n### Response3:", "answer": "B: try to learn"}

A bankruptcy may happen if the company loses a lawsuit, or does not produce the expected profits, or is unable to receive payment for goods or services.\nLiquidation\nThe company is liquidated, which means that the company's employees are terminated and its assets are turned over to its creditors. If assets are still available after settling claims, creditors will be paid in accordance with the priority schedules previously established. Liquidation may necessitate the appointment of an estate trustee, a liquidator, or bankruptcy administrator to control and distribute company funds.\nWhen the firm has no equity, the Court of Bankruptcy may decide to accept a creditor's voluntary arrangement offer. For a creditor's plan (a plan presented by a creditor), the bankruptcy procedure can allow the creditors to propose that debts be restructured in a certain way, and the company can file for an insolvency plan.

{"text": "In my opinion, the above question is hard to comprehend, though I have some clues. To solve this question, first, I will eliminate the choices which are not related to the question and choose the choice of the rest of them.\nThe part of'A: solidifying B', I can find that the first part and the last part of it, they have a different concept from each other. In my understanding, they can't be two similar choices. Then, the reason that this option is not a choice, is that this operation has different content with'melting '. And the last part, it contains a word 'C': getting cold.' It does not reflect the content of the question. I can deduce that the other four option is the most correct one.

{"text": "John did not enjoy procreating. He had a hangup that prevented him from successfully becoming a father.  In other words, he was \"in a nutshell\" (or \"in a shell\") and he did not want to \"put out\" or \"make love.\"\n\n### Response Explanation:\nFor this item we are asked to solve for the variable, which is John.  First, we note that John is not enjoying the act of procreating.  This means John is opposed.  Next, we note that John has a \"hangup\" about procreating (John didn't enjoy it).  A hangup, as defined in the dictionary, is something that interferes in such a way that prevents one from doing a task.  So, procreation is a task that requires one to do something (orgasm).  So far, we can conclude that John is opposed to having any orgasms and is also in a funk because having orgasms has become quite taxing for him.  The next piece of information in the problem refers to John getting what out of bed.  Since he's in a nutshell, he is still completely dressed so putting out is not a way to achieve orgasm for John.  This leaves cumming as the most reasonable choice. So, John is a guy that doesn't enjoy procreation but would enjoy getting it out of the way if it meant being able to come, but he doesn't like having orgasms and thus he is not going to be naked when he attempts to do so.  We don't know what he can do to make the procrement more \"fun\" (ie he might be able to get his freak on and still not be naked), but he certainly isn't into his bedsheets by the time he gets done.", "answer": "C: naked"}

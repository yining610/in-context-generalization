The prize was a 10-inch toy boat with a small motor that spins around from side to side.  The contest was judged on the boat's skill to twirl around in the water. The contest's three judges chose to give the boat to the man who twirled it around in the shortest amount time.  The judges chose not to give out any other awards (like the other best man's boat that didn't win). Of the 3 contestants, two kept their boats and one boat was damaged and thrown out. Three sailboats were available for the prizes, and the first sailboat was damaged beyond repair when the judges tried to determine the winner. The second sailboat was small, but the judges thought it was good enough. The large sailboat was the 3rd sailboat. For the two boats that were damaged, the contestant who had the better boat was given the prize while the best contestant's boat was destroyed. The 3rd sailboats were damaged by the judges. All of the boats were damaged when the judges determined the winners, so no boat was given to a sailor who did not win.

Jeremy and Kira have the same shoe sizes. Kira and Chris both have size 45 shoes. So who has the same number of shoes as Jeremy? a. Kira b. Chris c. Jeremy\nOutput: Jeremy \n\n## Solution:\n\nThis question is related to 2020 US SAT Math Test 4\nFor the first question, you can use the total number of stickers at time t - the number of stickers used earlier and the number of stickers she has remaining. The stickers she has remaining (call it s) is used to subtract the total number of stickering she's used (call it m)and get the remainder. It's m + s where the remainder is what's left over from subtracting.\n```\ns = m - m + s - m\ns = m - s\ns = m - (m-s)\ns = m - 2 m\ns = 2m - m\ns = 4m\n```\nSince we're taking the remainder of a given number divided by s, we're finding the modulus of m / 4m. Since modulus is defined in python as a % operator, we replace 4m with \"4m\" (using two backticks).\n```python\nimport backtick\na = input('Input: Mary had 169 stickers.\\nOutput: ')\na = int(a)\nb = (a/169)/backtick.backtick('4m')\nans = b % 4\nanswer.append(ans)\n\n\n```\nFor the second question, there are three steps. First, you have to calculate her remaining money. That's what she has left to spend. This gives an amount which you'll need to get to $100 more so she can buy her bike. As for the amount, you can figure out a formula by thinking of this problem in terms of a budget.", "answer": "C: fast"}

Why or why not?\n- What are some pros of recursion?\n- What are the cons of recursion?\n\nRecursion is the concept that you are given a function that will call itself. The following is a simplistic example of what recursion does. It calls itself by using itself as an argument for another iteration. \n![Recursion example](https://roscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/recursion5.png)    \nThis is a function that we have called recursly.  We see that the first line calls itself with a different argument, so it starts another iteration. The result is the number that is raised to the power of itself. Thus in this example recursion is very useful to us in our programming.\n\n\n### More Reading:\n\n[Recursion in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_recursion.asp)\n\n[Ask HN: The Curious Case of Recursion](https://hackernoon.com/recursion/)\n\n[Recursions in Go](https", "answer": "B: center"}

He then sold whatever he could. As the police were following his trail, he noticed something was wrong, but had no idea it was the police. He then went to his house, packed all of his belongings and drove away. Another thief, a man in his mid forties, did exactly the same thing. He had stolen only $1000 last night and $1500 the night before. He stole items worth at least $450 the day after the robberies were reported. A woman in his thirties had been robbing homes as well.

If you want to return the answer, the function should return an `int` instead.  Additionally, the `for` loop condition needs an if statement to make sure the number of variables being returned is <= the number of variables the caller needs... otherwise, you're trying to return more variables than exist in the caller's local scope.\n\n\\begin{code}\nif (len(question) == 1 && len(answer) == 1) :\n    return int(float(question) +'' + float(answer))\n\n...\nelif (len(question) > 1 && len(question) <= len(answer)) and isinstance(question, str) and isinstance(answer, str):\n    return int(' '.join(question))\n\n...\n\\end{code]\n\nFor the most part, you've got the style of a library in this script, so I'd just say you might want to look at the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and the [Zen of Python](https://code.activestate.com/blogs/python/2016/04/17/the-zen-of-python/), and use these as guides for how to lay out your code.\n\nWith respect to your specific questions,\nyour questions are actually fairly simple - `int` has a number of built in, predefined methods, and the majority of these are methods that convert from one data type to another.  That is, `int()`, `float()`, `long()` and `bool()`.\n\nFor example, one such method is called `atoi` and takes a string and returns an `int` value.

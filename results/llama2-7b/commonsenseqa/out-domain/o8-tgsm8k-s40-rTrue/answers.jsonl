Even when people would say I can't understand or I don't understand your sentence, you might repeat something differently and they might suddenly understand and so on.

One way to get a bus transfer is to buy it from the driver but another way is to transfer from one bus to the next without paying.  He used to pay $1.50 for each bus transfer.

How tall is one side of a square whose surface area is 64 square inches?\nOutput: Let the side of a square be represented as x.\nArea =<<64>>64 = 4x^2\n\n4x^2=<<4*x^2>>4*x^2\n\nTherefore, x =<<4=2>>2, and that means that the sides of the square are each 2.\nTherefore, one side is 2.\nThere are then 4 sides to a square, and the given surface area is 6\nThere are 4 sides in a square of area 6.  Therefore, the height is 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>, which is 10 cm.\nSo the final answers are 25 and 10cm respectively\n\nInput: Which letter comes next in the series?

{"text": "<<Adulation>>Adulation B, as defined by google: admiration\nSo C is the answer\nIf a friend gives you a recommendation. Your friend's recommendation will probably influence the decision. A recommendation means that the friend believes that you will like the product, book, website, or activity. A recommendation can also apply to a company or even a service. They want you to try their product and see if you like it. If you like it, you should continue to try it or buy it.\nA good recommendation could be a suggestion from a friend. Maybe you like to read a lot of books, and your friend gives you a recommendation saying that the book is awesome, so you might buy it. This example is a positive recommendation that is good because it makes you want to buy it.

You roll two dice. What is the probability that the sum of the two die rolls is more than the answer produced by the two-time-table?\nOutput: This is going to be the problem from chapter number 3 from our introduction to probability text.\nSo this is a classical example for our two-time table exercise.\nSo if n is random, and the amount subtracted 10x\nSo that would make 10\nAnd if we say x, then it's 10x is added, or x plus 10\nSo for our dice roll is we got two dice\nIt would have to be greater than 12\nBecause a sum of one and one for each of the dice is 2\n\nTherefore to answer to the questions what is the probability that the summary of the two die roll is more than 12\n\nIt would be 0.5\nSince the odd is 1/6\n\nSo the total odd is one and a half\nNow to finish the chapter you need to explain the probability for 10\nFor 8 which is the difference of 8\nSo it would be 0.25\n\nFinished", "answer": "B: applaud"}

{"text": "Inflation is caused by the printing of more money than there currently is.\nIf a country printing more money than they currently have, it will lead to a lowering of the value of the currency, which will lead to a negative economic impact for that country.\nThe value of the currency will decrease as money is put into circulation because of inflation, which means that the inflated country won't be able to import as many goods and services as it previously could, which will lead to economic instability, such as inflation, deflation, etc.\nIf people are unable to import goods and services, then they won't have as great of an economy (because they will have more difficulty importing goods and services on credit), which can cause issues such as deflation (where the value of their currency goes up, thereby causing them to lose jobs, which leads to negative economic growth) and negative economic growth can ultimately lead to unemployment, which can make it difficult for the country to pay off its debts and its interest rates will go up.\nWhen interest rates go up, there will end up less demand for goods and services from the country because people are paying more interest on their houses, loans, etc.\n\nSo ultimately, if inflation is not successful, the country will end up having to deal with negative economic growth issues such as unemployment, which ultimately can lead to deflation and lowering of the value on the country's currency.\nSo the final answers are A,B,E,A,E,D,E,C,D,D,E\n\nInput: A man starts running at 2:30PM from town A to town B which is 9 miles away.

If girls between the ages of 16 and 23 are randomly selected, at most what fraction of those selected will be gymnasts?\nOutput: If one in ten girls is gymnasts in the certain country, this means each girl has a probability of p= 1/10= <<1/10=0.1>0.1 of being a gymnast.\nSince there are ten girls per age group where gymnasts can also be selected, they have a probability of p=10*p=<<10*0.1= 100>>100 of being a gymnasts.\nSince there are between 16 and 17 girls per age group where they could be selected, they have an overall probability of 17*100=<<17*10==2000>>2000 of being a  gymnasts.\nIn total, between 16 and twenty three, there are n*2000 =<<n*2000=3072>>3072  girls.\nSo the fraction of girls out of 3072 selected will be G=3072/<<3072=3072%>>3072%\nSeveral of these people are gymnast, so since 3072 / 100 =<<3072/100==30>>30\nis the fraction of girls out 99 girls that will be gymnast, this means that 3072 girls is how many women selected.\nThe answer will be 0.3 + 0.03=<<0.3+0.03=0.33>>0.33 and this is the final answer. \n\nInput: There are 330 students attending Winslow Elementary School who are in grades 1-4.

If he was grooming for 5+ hours per day, and working 7 days a week this would be around 3800 grooming hours per year. Assuming this man was a barber, we know that the hair growth rate is about 1 inch per month. So the man cuts around 40 inches of hair over the course 1 year (3800 cuts/year). With 40 inches over 500 cuts/ year (this is the number of cuts after one month).  This is approximately 4/5ths of an inch per cut. And given the density of hair this would be 4/5th of an inch per day. This number of cuts would be around 2750 grooming hours a year.\nSo if this were a professional groomer, 3800 cut/year * 550 = <<3800*550=210000>>21000 cuts or 210,000 cuts in one year\nSo the final answer would be about 210,100 cuts or more likely an injury\n\nInput:  A dog lays down in the snow while its master shovels the driveway.

{"text": "You're waiting for the metro station, waiting for a train, waiting to read your favorite book. The metro station is just like vegetables, except that you might need to leave it behind after you've finished reading.\nThe bookstore is next to the metro station, but no one would be waiting to buy a book, or to read a book.\nSince the book is next to the store, you're waiting to read a book in the bookstore.\n\nInput: I would go from the mall to the bookstore, and then to the movies, and then to the food court. The mall is also on the right side from the bookstore and next to the movies. Choices: A: right side B: left side C: north side D: south side.\nOutput: Since the mall is also on right side from the book store, the shortest distance to walk is from the side of the bookstore to the mall. The easiest way is from the right side of the bookstore, and there's no way to walk backwards.\nAs stated earlier, the left side of the bookstore has shorter distance to walk, so it's better to take the shorter way, rather than walk through the mall to go to the bookstore.\nAlso, the food court is on the south side of the other places.\nThus, you should walk to the food court from the south side of the mall.\n\nInput: There's a cake decorated with cream, carrot, and strawberries.

Now let x represent the number of strawberries. The total diameter of the cake is 2x, and the total diameter is 100x and 4x.\nx = <<100=100>>100\n80x = 100x\nx = <<1=80>>", "answer": "D: train station"}

If a customer uses less than 500 kilowatts of electricity each month, he will pay for exactly 10% of the base rate, rounded down to the nearest cent.  If the customer uses 501 kilowatts or more, then for every extra kilowatt used, the customer will pay 4 cents for every kilowatt used.  For example, if a customer uses 507 kilowatts of energy during the month, then the customer will be charged $7.42 per month, since (1) the customer uses \\$1.50 for the base, and (2) the customer has to pay for \\$7.00/10% = \\$0.70 for 10% of his base rate, and (3) since the customer pays 4 cent premium for every extra kilowatthour or $0.048 per kilowatt, so he pays $0.04 x 507 kilo watt hour - \\$0.048 x \\$507 kilowatom hour, so his total out of pocket expense would be \\$0.299 for the extra usage.  If the customer's energy usage is less than 501 kilo watt hours, then he will be charged $2.47 per month, as he is only responsible for $1.25 for the base rate + $0.20 for 10 % rounded down.  The total charge would be $1.25 (base rate) + 0.048 (extra charge) * $507 = $2.47\nOutput: The answer is D\n\nInput: Which vehicle is quick to accelerate and has less pollution", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

Among the pairs of shoes, 12% of the pairs are either high heels or slip-ons. You decide it's time to get rid of 6 pairs of shoes altogether.  What is the percentage of shoes that are high heels or slop-ons?\nOutput:  We know that the shoe with 0% is not high heels nor slop-ons.\nWe know there are 9 pairs.\n12% of 9 pairs is 0.12, which is the same as saying 0.12*9 is the total pairs of shoes out of 9 pairs.\nHowever, 0.12 * 9 is not a pair. Therefore, we have to multiply to get a pair, which is 0.1 = <<0.1=0.1>>0.1, which is a pair for each 9.\nSince there is 0.1 high heels or sloop-ons in each 9 pairs, the whole number is 55.\nSince slop-ons is excluded, we have 12% of 55 is 60% of high heels.\nIf there is 75% high heels, which is 60% + 10% (10% is the other 12%) is 70% high heels.\nSince 12% of all the shoes are high heels, and 12% of high heels will be high heels or srop-ons, 12% is 70% + 12% * 0.1 = 75% high\nWe know that 35% is high heels, which makes 55% high heels or sloped-ons.\nTherefore, the final answer is 60%.\n\n# Question 225 Choose only One: We can find 699068% of 96.\n\n# Question 150 Choose only One: The 50% who have a job makes money by working", "answer": "C: maps"}

Each child has a special talent (sense of humor, magic, singing) and gets special dessert. All the children have something in common (they are all boys), but they don't like the same thing (one may be a vegetarian or have food allergies). If a babysitter leaves the room with a child, they may leave a note on the refrigerator and not talk to the child for 15 minutes (this restriction is imposed by the parents and the babysitter can't eat cookies while the child is not in sight).

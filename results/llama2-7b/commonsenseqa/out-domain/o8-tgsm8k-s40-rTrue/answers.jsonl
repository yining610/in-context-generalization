I needed to focus on grammar and organization. My first sentence was \"When you are reading news, you can find ads on television, bus, emails, and on your smartphone, or on the Internet\". My second sentence \"Which one do you think can be really seen the  most. In my humble opinion, it is the  Internet.\" My third sentence was \"Because, why?  \" \n  The reason why is because as I was taking this quiz, the idea came to my mind to add the reason why I thought Internet is the best way of advertising and to use grammar to get the point across better. Since \"when you are reading news, can find ads on TV, bus, emails, or on the internet....\" was a run on thought without a capital for the first letter of the sentence. And since I used ads in place capitalized like 'Internet' it should have been written as 'Internet' not 'ad'. This time I added this question as \"Why do you think 'Internet' is the best way of getting your message out?  Because of....\" In this question I added why not just the reason why \"Internet\" is the best way to get your message across to the reader. Since this quiz you need at least 250 words, I added 50 words with this rationale.

{"text": "Sights.\n\n### Comments: I think it's wrong its called a telescope.\n\nAnswer:\n**BINOCULAR**\n\nExplanation: The binocular (bink-uhn-kuhl) lens is a pair of lenses, usually placed a short distance apart. The lenses focus on the object that is between them. The lenses each form a small image of the object in front of it. These two small images, projected at slightly different angles, form a three-dimensional image or a stereo image of the object.\n\nThe magnification or the ratio of the size of the object to the size of the image is the focal ratio. It is written like this, f/12.6. The f (focal or f1) is the focal length and the 12.6 is the ratio of the focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil. Because the entrance pupil is usually smaller in the binocular lens, the focal ratio is usually greater. Binoculars tend to have a focal ratio between f16 and f18.\n\nAnother way to think about the size of the image on the retina of the viewer is to consider the length of the object being viewed. Suppose someone is looking at a large bear at a zoo and that bear is standing at a distance of 75 feet, or 23 meters, from the lens.\n\nSuppose the distance between the lenses is 45 millimeters and the angle of view, or the angle the object is visible through each lens, measures 30 minutes or \u00bd hour. The magnification would be 75(m)(f/2x10^-6) = 1,500,000. This is also called 1500x. 600,00 times greater than the actual size of the bear's head.\n\n### Question 10\n\n**Answer: B**\n\n### Question:\nThe only people allowed on the elevator are employees.

{"text": "What I think the question is asking, is what place of work might you _find a hairpin?_ so they're more than likely asking what place of work you might find a hairpin while looking. So, places in which you might find a hair as a result of looking for it: hair of a women, for a hairstyle or a pincushion are all possible, but a barber shop might stand out, based on the clues. The hair of a woman is where women would go to have their hair styled. Also, a hair salon might be where women go to get their hair done. Maybe these businesses would be the best choices if the location mentioned in the question would be the word _of_ with a space in between, but the question was worded like _work_ with the letter _o_ in the word _hairpin_. Also, another place that might stand out would be _pin_ with a space in-between, since it would have double consonants and the words _hair_ and _hairpin_.

B\nRationales: furnitures is short for furniture.\nFurniture means things that are used to store your personal items in a room such as a closet or cupboard.\nFurniture is to store your personal items, not to sit on.\nIncorrect: You can put furniture on top a floor or room or apartment, but you can\u2019t put furniture on top the roof.\n####  D\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: When the temperature goes up 3 degrees for each hour after 10:00 AM, by how much has the temperature increased by 3 PM?\n\n### Solution:\n\nI put the wrong answer.\n\n### Step by Step explanation\nInput: In this question, the degree of the temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F).\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) is a temperature scale.\nIn general, temperature is measured either in degrees Celsius or Kelvin. The degrees Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales use absolute zero and 100\u00b0C as scale points. This gives us the following formula: \\(T_C = T_K - 273.15\\) and \\(T_K = \\frac{T_C + 273.\\)15}{2}\\).\n\nSo when the temperature goes up 1\u00b0 in a degree Celsius, it goes up 1.8\u00b0 in Kelvin and when the temperature goes down 1\u00b0 in a Kelvin, it goes down 1.8\u00b0 Celsius.\nThe rate of the increase in Celsius is 1.8\u00b0. In a degree Celsius every hour, every degree Celsius (or Fahrenheit) has a rate of 60\u00b0 per 5 hours.\nSo we need to find the rate of growth for a degree on Kelvin. So the rate of increase on a Kelvin is 69.6 = <<69.6=35.5>>35.5\u00b0 per 5 hours, and the rate of decrease on a Kelvin is -71.2 = <<71.2=-35.5>>-35.5\u00b0", "answer": "C: floor"}

Since A didn't fit all the criteria I checked against the other choices and noticed that they were all about a longer beauty servicing and only a couple talked about it taking longer than the intended time. With A being the only choice to have an injury and the only choice that did not include beauty, I selected the choice based on the data I had gathered from the question.\n\n## Additional notes:\n\n  * -\n\n  * -", "answer": "C: late"}

{"text": "Let's examine all of these places, starting with:\n\n* Pet store: This is a place where pets live indoors, typically under a constant human surveillance.  Therefore, pets don't have a chance to roam freely at every moment of the day, and they might not move around at all after nightfall, thus leading to possible animal abuse.  Even if the owner of the pet store treats animals with care and love, this place is still not suitable for John.\n\n* Parking lot: This might be a place for some wild animals to live, as well.  However, such animals move around only during daylight hours.  They are exposed to extreme weather conditions at night.  Therefore, this environment might lead to animal abuse.  Moreover, if the parking lot is surrounded by high buildings, then it might even have an even more adverse effect.  There is simply too much artificial light around to create the natural pattern of the day and the night.  Therefore, John would avoid this place.\n\n* Park: Again, this is not a suitable environment for animals.  They are used to roaming freely during the day, just like people do.  Therefore, parks are not meant for keeping pets.  If an animal owner takes his/her pet to the park, then he should be aware that the animal will never be really happy, due to the park's nature.  Therefore, John should choose another place.\n\n* North America: This continent has a very specific ecosystem.  It is possible that some animals roam wildly in North America.  However, this is not enough to satisfy John's need for animal care.  Furthermore, some people do mistreat animals in North America, as well.  Thus, the answer would be, no, John should not avoid this place.", "answer": "A: pet store"}

{"text": "A\n\n#### Answer:A\n\n### Rationale:The given answer choices represent the grammatical function they perform in English. An adjective (one representing a noun or pronoun) will answer the question of what something is (what kind of shoe is it?), and an adverb (one representing a verb or adjective that describes a verb) will answer the question about what something is going to do (does the dog look happy or sad?). An article, pronoun, conjunction, and interjection do not typically describe anything, and as such do not answer the question of what.\n\n### Input;What does an article do?  Choices: A: A: article, B: B: adjective, C: article, D: C: Conjunction, E: adverb A: A: article\n\n### Response (D):\n\n#### Answer (D):\n\n### Rationales:An article is a word, usually a, an, or the, that precedes a noun to make it more specific (for example, the dog vs. dog or the sun vs. sun).\n\nAn adverb is a word that either answers a question about whether someone is doing something, or what it is that someone is going to do (for example, she happily walked the dog vs. she happily walked).\n\n### Input A:Adverb B:Conjunction C:Prounoun D:Adjuction E:Interjection F:Article A:Adverb F:Article\n\n### Response A:-\n\n#### Answer A:-\n\n### Rations:An adverb is a type of word that either confirms the action, or answers the question of what kind of action the action is going to be.\nA conjunction word is a connecting word, as opposed to a conjunctive word. (A conjunction word connects different clauses, whereas a conjunctive word does not).\nA pronoun is a word that stands in for a noun (for example, they are all good pronouns). An article is a word that precedes a nounce (for example, the big and white dog).

How many apple cobbler bites have you had this week?(The answer is 5)\n\n  You're not sure how many apple cobbler bits you've had, since it takes 8/8 of an apple to make apple cobbler. However, it can be determined by taking 1/8 as the original divisor, subtracting the 5, and then dividing by 8/8.

We can solve for y: $$\\frac{(y+2)}{(y+2)(2)}=1$$ or $$y=1-3$$.\n\n###\n\n### Explanation:\n###\nLet y = the weight of the dog next year.  We know that this dog has doubled its weight over the last three years.  This means that if you double the weight this year, you need to double it again next year.

You're not going to take a walk through the oven, since that is pretty uncomfortable. You're not even going to eat a cake that you've baked yourself, since that's kind of weird. Even though baking a cake is fun, it is less fun than spending time with friends, so you're going to skip out on baking one today. Since your pants are clean, you don't want to wear oven mitts over them, so you're not going to go into the bakery either. You don't really want to buy a cake from the bakery, so it's more than likely that you don't want groceries either. Finally, you probably don't know anyone working at a theater in your area, so you don't really want a theater ticket either. That leaves the bakery, grocery store, and theater as three of your possible choices.

(23x - (-17) - (-5)) + (5x + (-21) + 11 + (-5)) = (x - 21) - 36\n\n### Response\nSince (-17)+(-5)=0, the first part of the equation gives (-17) and (-5) as factors. Multiplying them will result in -21.\nIn the second part of the equation, the sum of (-21)+11 will equal 10. But 10 will also divide (-21).\nThe answer to this arithmetic equation will then be (x -21) because we are dividing the equation by (-21) to isolate the equation to only 1 variable.\n\n### This task can be done in both a horizontal tree view, or a diagram of a tree.\n\n### Answer\nThe equation is (23x - 5) + (32x + 11) = 32\n### Rationale \nTo solve for (x), isolate the variable by dividing the equation by (x-1)\n\n### Input & Output\nIn a given problem, the 2 variables will always be negative integers with no more than 12 digits totaling to be less than 10000\nSo this equation will reduce to: 23x - 41 + (32x - 11) =32\n\n### This question is a combination of the previous exercises of task and concept questions.\n\n### Note\nThe given problem states that \"the sum of two numbers n and m is equal to 4 more than n\".

Use the information from the passage to answer the questions.\n\n### Passage\n\nA group of kittens was found abandoned and orphaned by their mother.  So, the local animal shelter hired a kitten nurse to care for the kittens as they waited for adoption.  \n\nEach morning, the kitten nurse fed the kittens their milk and food, checked for any injuries or illnesses, and made sure the litter box was clean to avoid issues with infection or disease. At night, she gave kitty baths, tucked them in for the night, and watched over them throughout the night.\n\nBy the end of the week, the kittens began to be healthy and strong. Many of the kittens were adopted but there were still three kittens that needed a home.\n\nWhen the kitten nurse announced that three of the kittens needed homes, an elderly couple in the neighborhood who were getting ready to leave on a long trip offered the shelter their house.  They were willing to let the shelter use their home to house and care for the kitties as long as the kittens remained in good health.\n\nThe kitten coordinator was excited to hear this news.  She informed the shelter staff that she had volunteers interested in adopting the kittens and would be bringing them in to pick out which kittens they wanted.\n\nAfter the foster family moved into the house, the kitten nursery remained open until the kittens were able to be adopted out.  Since the couple living in the house had an 18-year-old cat of their own, they decided to adopt two of the kittens.  The shelter coordinator allowed the kitten nurse to take the remaining kitten home with her for the weekend.", "answer": "C: party"}

The car trunk cannot provide an option as most of the time the driver is taking groceries, but not shopping. Moreover, the car trunk is large, but it can only take a maximum of just shopping bags.

This option does not make sense because grocery stores often don't have a place to store shopping bags while in stores. If it's a small-town store maybe, but even then the stores are likely to have storage spaces full already. The best option is definitely backseat. Bags are safe.\n#### \n\n### Input (Answer): B.

{"text": "Place in the library and corner, or alternatively, place in the library, demonstration, and corner; it is also possible to place in the library, corner, football ground, and rug.\n\n### Rationale: The given question has six answer choices each comprising an entire sentence. However, we can place a table in more than one of the six choices to fit our purpose. We can place a table in the library in any of these four ways: a) library and corner: for example, library corner b) library demonstration: for example, if you place a table in the demonstration, where it will have nothing else to rest on but the floor c) library football ground: this combination of choices does not seem to make sense since football ground is unambiguously outdoors, but we know the library might be so if there is a football game for guests to enjoy d) library rug: if you place your table in the rug there is only a small chance it will make it outdoor, as long as you are there to guide it to the football ground\n\nWe can place a table in a library and corner or demonstration or football ground or rug, but we can also place a table in a demonstration and corner, which is also good because demonstration and football ground look similar as if they're in the same location, such as the demonstration football ground, which is also in the library corner, or we can alternatively place a table in the rug and football ground, which puts it in the library corner and demonstration, or demonstrate and corner in library and football ground.\n\nRationale#: Given the number of answer choices, it is possible that multiple places where we can put our table will fit our purpose. Since all possible combinations are equally likely since all of them make sense, the table can be placed in library, demonstration, corner, football ground and rug but they can also be placed library, demonstration, football ground or some combination of them. To see how the six choices fit into each other, the table could be placed in the rug, in the library, in the demonstration, in the corner, on the football field, and in the library corner.\n\n### Input\nYour friend has $3,600 saved for a trip with friends that costs $8,500.

{"text": "The correct response for this question is: Choice [A]\n\n### Rationales:\nIn this question, the best choice for someone to answer would be [A] because lizards most commonly live in desert areas.\n#### 0\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input - 2:It is April and 600 students are taking a final exam.  The teacher wants to ensure that there are 1.5 students per desk for every chair but 3.0 students per desk for each table.  Each chair can hold exactly one person and each table can hold exactly one person.  Every group is given a different room where they will sit.  How many rooms are needed if the teacher wants to make sure that \n- no student has to sit in the same place as another student-every desk has exactly 1.5 occupants if possible-when seated two students cannot see each other- every table has 3 occupants- two chairs are left over-\n\n### Response - 2: The correct answer for this question would be 7.\n\n### Rationale:\nIn this question there are a total of 600 students.  According to this question, every desk must have 1.5 students.  This means there must be a minimum of half the number of students to fill every available desk.   Therefore since 300 students are already in seats that is 1/2 the number of students.  Therefore there is a need for only 2 seating arrangements for 1.5 students to sit at the desks. \n```\n# desks    # students   \n1*1.5     (1/2)       \n2 5\n```\n\n### 1\n\n### Racionales:\nThe correct answer to this question is 4.\nThe reason for this number of correct responses is because each desk is either fully occupied or left with a \"residual\" of 1 student.  In order to ensure all the seats are properly assigned, the teacher had to ensure that each desk is populated.  This means that each desk receives 15 students.  This in turn means that there can not be any doubles.  Therefore, for 15 students at every desk, the answer is:\n```\n# desk   # student\n1    15", "answer": "D: garden"}

While throwing a rock into the river, you are guaranteed to sink it or have it float, not get launched up into the sky. You can use a bridge to jump up and to go high, but if your intention is to make a splash, that won't make a splash. If you are throwing from inside a house, if you do not know the exact distance, you will simply be throwing the rock at some random point where the impact will be weak. Finally, a mountain range is made primarily of upward sloping surfaces - all you need to do is throw straight up instead of aiming where you want the rock to go. A mountain countryside has some downward slopes with rocks in the river. A surface of the ground is made of downward-sloping surfaces, and thus anything could happen if you throw a rock.\n\n### Inputs:Sarah's birthday is April 16.

This is because this sequence can be made into a 6x4 subarray, and in subarrays, we can add the elements until the sum is less than or equal to one, meaning that we need to add 5 elements to create a length of 5, which is the last number in the subarray of Sarah and her daughter' problem.

C \"enter school\" seems to be a general statement without much precision for what must be done to enter school. D \"wash dishes\" suggests the child needs to make sure the dishes are clean for after school and the child needs to make time for that in the chase.

The two numbers in the problem, 30 and 20, are prime numbers because they cannot be evenly divided by any number other than themselves or 1 so they are prime numbers by definition.\n\n### Solution 2:2:\nThe answer of this question is B. So long as the price of one cup of coffee is greater than $1, a profit can be made. However, when there are only 10 cups of coffee, the profit can only equal $6 at which point the price of a cup would be increased to at least $4.814, making a profit impossible.\n\n### Solutions 3:3\nThe answer to this equation is C. The difference between 5 and 3 is 2. This means that the number of puppies will be 3 less than three times the 20 number which is 48, and adding 20 to that results in 68 which is the expected number of Schnauzer puppies.\n\n### 4:4\nThe answer to this problem is B.

The remaining toothbrush supply after each month is equal to the number of toothbushes Dr. Banks originally gave away. Therefore, the remaining toothbrshes at the end of the year must equal 164 because 164 was the total number of toothbrsus that Dr. Banks originally had.\n\n###  5:5\nThe answer to this is B since the equation 53/2 + 67/2 + 46/2 = 90 is true.

The following rationales were all correct:\nA: In order to breathe, a person must breathe in by using their lungs and diaphragm.\nB: When a person uses their diaphragm, open throat, and abdominal muscles, they are breathing in oxygen.\nC: Breathing involves oxygen being pulled in by the lungs and diaphagm opening, which can open the throat.\nD: Air is pulled into the lungs and diapragm when a person uses their abdominal muscles.\nE: Air is taken in when a person uses their diapragm, along with using their lungs, abdominal muscles and/or open throat.\n\n#### A: lungs and D: air \n\nRationales::  Lungs: Lungs pull in clean air. The air is then oxygenated by the lungs and transferred throughout the rest of the body.  Lungs: Oxygen-filled air is taken into the body and lungs. Then the blood from the lungs get oxygen. This is called breathing in. The heart then sends this blood everywhere around the body. It makes the body work. When the blood is filled with oxygen, it is sent into the lungs, and the process starts over again.\nThere are two lungs, one on the left side of the body and one on the right side. The lungs consist of millions of tiny air sacs, called alveoli. These tiny air sacs are connected to blood vessels. Your blood flows through the blood vessels and touches the walls of these sacs.

If that's all that was in a magazine, then it wouldn't really be a magazine. It'd probably be a web page, but probably not an advertisement. Advertisements usually appear in magazines, but sometimes in web pages or on buses or banners (like what's on this page right now).

A casket is either a burial vault or a casket. Caskets come in different colors and materials. A burial vault also comes in different colors and materials, but it is typically a steel product. When a casket is purchased, there are 10 possible choices:  casket, burial vault, wood, brass, steel, bronze, copper, cremation, vaults, and coffins. The cemetery will pick the burial product. The next section describes what happens if you order a burial vault, when you order a vault, and which color you must order. We know this for sure because of the cemetery rule. First thing you need to know is that the cemetery is the one that sells and delivers the product. Since the cemetery will actually be selling and delivering the product, they have the right to say how the product will look.  They will send your family member's (you or the family) body on a trailer or van in a casket box to the funeral home where we will place the body inside a vault. From the funeral home, we will call the cemetery and say the body is ready. This is done when the casket is in the center of the hearse. When the body leaves the funeral home it must be inside a casket box because we do not know if the casket is inside a wooden box or copper. This is a requirement by our association. When the casket is at our cemetery, we call the funeral home and arrange for the sexton to bring the casket over to us. Then we prepare the vault to bury the body and load it up inside of the casket.  What can you choose? The options are: wooden box. cremation, vases, coffins, coffins, vases, tissues and coffins.

The squirrel wanted to get a lot of water but the bird only wanted a little bit. Since the bird used a lot less water than the squirrel, they stopped by on of the birds watering hole on the way. The bird looked around on the ground and saw 26 drops of water, which she thought would be more than enough, but the bird was wrong.

{"text": "A: scotland\n\n#### Rationale: Scotland has a motorway known as the \"M80\". It begins in junction 14 of the M8 and links to junction 25 on the M74 and the M876. The motorway stretches 105 km across the central belt and links the cities of Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Stirling and Perth. The motorway, which was opened in 1976, carries a huge amount of traffic between Glasgow and Stirling. From Loch Lomond, the motorway swings westward then in a northwesterly direction through the Campsie Fells and the town of Falkirk. It was called the \"M85\" originally before being renamed M80 in March 1982. When the M74 was widened, the motorway was extended eastward to connect to junction 8 on the M74. The motorway carries a huge volume of traffic across the central belt, the busy East Kilbride\u2013Motherwell\u2013Lanarkshire conurbation and the Firth of Forth. It carries heavy use from Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, to Stirling and the towns of Cumbernauld, Motherwell, Hamilton and Glenrothes.\nThe M80 connects the M74 and M8 junctions and also serves the town of Falkinbren.\n#### E: england\nThe United Kingdom, commonly known as Britain, is home to the famous M6. The M6 is a dual carriageway motorway that runs for about 297 miles (478 km). It links the West Midlands to the Lake District, serving as a connecting road to the M60 and numerous cities. The motorway begins at Knutsford in Cheshire and travels across a northern suburb in Birmingham. It ends at Rugby, a small village in central England. At the northern terminus of the M6, the motorway branches into the M62 to the west and the M60 to the north. The motorway was completed in 1970 and has many junctions that connect to minor and major roads.\nThe M6 is about 167 miles long and starts near Knutsford and branches out to connect other highways and localities.", "answer": "E: england"}

The first student to finish his pizza wins $4. If the first kid to finish three pizzas has two pies left, calculate how much that person should have won in total if the award for a whole pizza was only $3.\n```\n\n## Rationales:\nThis is similar to the following question:\nWhat is the value of x if 2 to the power of x is increased by the square root of 55?\nIn this question, if the first student to finish wins $4, if the first kid to finish has two pies left totaling 4, what does that mean for the first kid to finish?\n\n## Input: If the value of y is increased by 3 points then divided by x, 60 divided by a quantity of y is increased by x+2.\n\n## Rational : The denominator does not change and the numerator is increased by 3, but then divided by the x, but x should always go in, so the x should stay the same value. Also the increase of the quantity of y would affect the x, therefore the denominator would change.\n\n## Input : A number is increased by four and its value is the square root of that number decreased by 5; What is the value of that number?\n\n## Rational: You should double the number first to increase the number by 4, the square root must be taken and then decreased by 5, thus, you would be getting a rooted number in the denominator. The rooted number should be moved to the fraction's denominator as whole (like a division). The number that is in denominator must also go into the numerator of the fraction, but only after the square root is moved the denominator. So, you need to move the number four to the numerator, move the rooted number to the denominator, and move the rooted number into the numerator.

On Monday the average temperature is 25\u00b0C, and then on the remaining days the average temperature is 12\u00b0C less.  How many days is it during the year?\n\n### Solution\nRationales: The average temperature of the year starts off at 20\u00b0C then 25\u00b0C +12\u00b0C less than the daily average.\nLater, the average temperature starts off at 25\u00b0C.  After that it subtracts 12\u00b0C from the daily average, which is equal to 12\u00b0C.\nThis means the average temperature goes up then down, up then down, and so on.\nLet x = the number of days during the year\nThe average x days during the year is 0+(25)(12)\n\nThe days x during the year are (25)(12)+0 = <<(25)(12)=300>>300\nThis means the year is 300 days.\n#### 300\nAnswer: 240 + 10 + 50\n\n### Input/Output\n\n### Input #2\n\n### Demostration:Answer the following question using your calculator\n\n### Input#3\nYou can use what you have learnt in this course (and from your previous courses) to answer the following.\n\n### \n\n### Calculator Challenge\n\n### Input 4\n\n### Demstration\nAdd the following 3 equations by hand.\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Input5:\nWhat you did? \n\n### Demos:\n\n### Answer\n\n### Input6 \nGiven \\(9^2-3\\)\n\n### Demo\n\n### Input7\n\n### Demo:\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Output8:\nOutput all of your calculations in the comment box below.", "answer": "D: farm yard"}

{"text": "<b>Correct:</b> **E: errors**\n<b>Explanation:</b> The word errors was presented to me in the form of a mathematical equation. They were given four terms, and asked what the name of the equation was: 3x +3y +3z. In this case, their terms are like the letters in the equation, so the proper name of this equation is errors. <b>Example:</b> Answers: <b>A: happiness</b> <b>B: sore muscles</b> <b\"C: injury</b> <b: perfection</b>\n<b>Note:</b> If this was a word problem, the answer would be the mathematical equation in a formula.\n\n### Rationales:\n<b>Example 1:</b> <b><u>A:</u></b>, The word, 'happy', was presented to me, and I had to identify what it was. I did not have to figure out what 1+3+2 means because I had the information at my fingertips, and I was able to see that the answer was 6. <b><u>B:</u></b> similarly, they asked me to identify a word,'sore' was presented to me and I had no reason to figure out that it meant pain. When I was asked what 6-2 is, I said, 4. <b><u>'C:</u></b>: The answer here was not 'injury' because they asked me to identify what that word meant, and 'D: perfection' was not an answer because the word was not presented to me.\n\n### Conclusion:\n<b>General rule:</b> If there is a word on the screen, and it is not in a mathematical equation, then that word must mean something.\n\n### Example:\n<b>A:</b> This year I ate 35 pumpkins and 10 apples, but I did not eat any other fruit.

Mary is paying for a tool that will increase the expenses by 9. Who is paying the most money?\n\n**Response: Mary\n**Rationale: Mary is paying the most because the other two numbers are multiplications whereas Mary is only a number.

Not too long ago, calculators were made of a tiny size, so people could tuck them away in a wrist-watch.  They had big buttons and large numbers to fill the small face of the watch.  If you walked down the street and everyone stopped and stared at your wrist-watch, they would say \"Wow!  What a great calculator!\"\n\n### Answer: Wrist-watch\n\n#### B\nAncient Roman people always carried around tiny little pocket calculators called abacuses.  They looked a little like this:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Vintage_abacus.JPG\nHowever in the 5th century a man named John of Salisbury came up with a wrist-watch calculator to make it easier to use an abacus.  It was very popular among the Romans and the calculators were used throughout the early Middle Ages.  The calculators were a pretty big deal.  However in the 1600's people didn't have that much money and the calculator watches were too expensive.  Therefore, people started using something called a slide rule, where a person puts a rectangle in a spiraling way to get the answer.\n\n### Answer B\n\n#### C\nIn 1691, a jeweler from France named Lunetier made the first desk calculators, which had the big buttons and small faces of a watch.  They were very popular because they were easy to use all day long.  In fact, they were so popular and common that many people would buy them instead of a wrist watch.\n\n###Answer C\n\n#### D\nIn 1635, a calculator was made that could do arithmetic.  The French call him Pascal.\nIn 1642, Blaise Pascal, a mathematician and scientist from France, wrote letters to a man named Pierre Fermat that contained problems and possible solutions.  He described the use of a Pascal's Arithmometer, and also said that one could buy it for almost 10 times less", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

The trash bin would not be designed to collect trashes other region but to only receive trashes from a specific region.\n\n### Input\nA person would carry a small drawstring bag to a garage.\n\n### Response\nC \n\n### Rationales: The statement of a small drawstring bag on a garage describes a person who uses a small bag with elastic to bring things such as car keys, spare tire, tire pressure gauge and wrenches when they go to the garage. The small drawstring bag with elastic is suitable for such items because of the small size. It is appropriate to only carry a suitable size when they are going the garage. If someone were to carry a larger size, it would be very inefficient to carry such things during an emergency such as flat tire, dead car battery, running out of gas, and other issues. An individual would need their keys in order to get back in when they are at the garage and the small drawstring bag with an elastic is a suitable enough to protect and carry such items.", "answer": "E: laundry room"}

It would also be made up of molecules, which would contradict the initial information you were given.

So if atoms are given in the initial problem, then molecules would have to be given somehow in the answer, and nothing is given.  If the right answer was D, you would be wrong. Atoms and molecules cannot be feet because one atom cannot make something the size and strength of feet.  So atoms and molecules must either be hands or air. To know they are molecules must be air is to make a conclusion from the initial problem, saying air and molecules are the same thing.  So when you know this, the answer becomes either hands or air.

They also tend to be placed near areas where groups of people are most likely to be found, such as shopping centers.\nMany passengers may not have time to travel to the city center before a bus arrives.

Since it can't be either of those, we must identify if it is the subject.\nIt is not a subject, and so it must be an object.  It describes the object\nhaving trouble with the print, which is the subject in the sentence.\nThe letter after letter in the sentence refers to the word \"after\" which is the\nobject of the sentence, and therefore the noun eye strain refers to the letter\nhaving trouble with print.\n```\n\n### Instructions:Look at the examples below and write a sentence using a subordinating conjunction.\n\n### Example 1:\nI am not tired because I took a nap today.\nI am tired because I took a\nnap today.\nI feel very tired because I stayed up all night playing video games.\nI feel very  tired\nbecause I  stayed  up  all\nnight playing video games.\n#### Answer:I stayed up all night because I feel very tired.\nIt is important to note that the subordinating conjunctions used in these sentences\nare not in italic.

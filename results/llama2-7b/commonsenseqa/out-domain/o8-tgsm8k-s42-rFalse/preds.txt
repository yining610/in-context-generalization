Some restaurants may only have basic, inexpensive options such as a plain salad with vinaigrette, while others may offer more elaborate and higher-priced options.<n><n>If the tip is limited, the most important factor in determining the appropriate tip is the quality of the salad.  This includes the components (such as whether it is fresh or canned), size of the plate, quantity, and overall presentation.<n><n>If the budget is not limited, the more upscale options tend to offer higher-quality salads, so for a higher-quality salad, a tip closer to 15% - 20% could be appropriate.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>We found [this](https://practicalpie.com/gift-guide-guide-salad-lover/)<n><n>### Input2:How does one measure the size of a choker?<n><n>###Response2:There are several ways to measure a choker.

If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.<n>Answer: 30<n><n>### Input:The only baggage the woman checked was a drawstring bag, where was she heading with it? Choices:  A: garbage can B: military C: jewelry store D: safe E: airport<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>*If the passenger used a drawstring bag to travel, then she may intend to travel to a jewelry store. So her destination is jewelry store*.<n><n>### Input<n>A plane that could fly nonstop from New York to Paris required 5 gallons of gasoline for every 100 miles flown. A plane that could fly non-stop from Montreal to London required 35 gallons of gas for every 10,000 miles flown, and 30 gallons of fuel was required for every 10 miles flown from Montreal to Boston. How many miles could be flown nonstop from Montreal to Paris if the maximum range of the plane is 5,000 miles?<n><n>### Response<n><n>By using these equation to figure out how many gallons of fuel the plane needed.<n><n>1:5,000 / 30 gallons ≈ 100 miles / gal = 200 miles<n><n>1:10,00 / 35 gallons ≈ 666 miles / gal<n><n>In the given case, the distance from Montreal to London is 4769.05 miles. But the distance to reach to Montreal to Paris is 5000 miles. That means it requires 100 miles per gallon for that. Because if 5000 distance can't be completed with 35 gallons. Then, it is clear that the distance will be completed with 200 gallons, but the distance would be completed before the plane was able to complete the mission.

Choices:  A: tennis racket B: skill C: competition D: tennis court E: legs<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is D). Tennis court.<n><n>You’re probably thinking, “Wait, isn’t the correct answer [Option A|B|C|E]? Well, let’s break down what the question is asking us.<n><n>[Option A] doesn’t make sense. Tennis court? Tennis player?<n><n>The question is simply asking, “What is required to be…good at playing tennis?”<n><n>[Option B] doesn’t make any sense. I don’t want to be a good tennis player just because I’m skilled. I think you’d have to be able to compete in a tournament where skills are tested to be a good tennis-“player.”<n><n>[Option C] is a good answer… in a way. In a tennis match-up, you compete, so it does make sense for it be one of the requirements to become a tennis player. However, if I practice my skills everyday and never compete in a match with other people, then I wouldn’t be a skilled tennis player. I could be a good tennis player without having to compete.<n><n>[Option D] is correct, however, the questions wants us to figure out, “How do we become good at playing tennis?” As written, it reads, “What is required?”, so I can get away with answering that it is tennis court.<n><n>This is not a comprehension question. This is a vocabulary question and, with that being so, we can’t expect the person answering to be able to figure out what a certain word means.

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n><n>### Response:		<n>If someone does not like learning we need first to see why they don't like it. I think that if someone does not like what is being learned is because that people have the fear of failing. We can change the learning process so that students feel more confident with the subject, so we can help students feel that what they are learning in school is fun and interesting, instead of something painful and boring.<n><n>### Input;Isn't it important for students to have fun when learning? Choices: A: Yes B: No<n><n>### Response;<n>I think it is important for students to have a great time when learning. When learning is fun, students are more creative, they can think more, they do not have to stress about things and they tend to do their best work.<n><n>### Answer:Would you change the learning process for every single student. Choices: A: yes B: no C: maybe<n><n>### Response No,<n>I don't think we should change the learning process for each student. Maybe some students want to learn a subject differently and that is why sometimes teachers will help students with something different than what the students ask, but I think we shouldn't just change the learning process for all students. Sometimes students have to pay attention and learn more independently so we should teach them how to do it or with someone who will help them if they need help with it.<n><n>### Choose one strategy in this chapter to support learning: Choices: A: Learning the first time.

The option that will get you more use and with less cost is Option 2. The price is the same no matter what because the price is in the denominate of a whole dollar (1.00). The more you subtract from the whole the farther you move from the 1.00. So in these situations you would want to subtract the amount of one because that's the closest, and when you want it to get far from 1.00 you subtract the biggest number possible.<n><n>### Input :How do we make sure we answer our question and don't cheat?<n><n>### Response :

There are some more small red, blue, green and yellow marbles in the box, each of which has a number written on it. It is not allowed to put a new marble of a different color on the pile. The aim is to arrange as many marbles as possible after having taken an arbitrary number of them. Now the following sequence is possible:<n><n>1. Red (take)<n>2. Yellow (take)<n>3. Blue (take)<n>4. Red (put)<n><n>### Task Description<n><n>In this game, you are given a sequence containing a series of statements that you can answer yes or no to. Each statement has an associated point value with higher-scoring statements being more difficult and time-consuming, but also more valuable. If you answer yes to a question, you get the associated point value plus a bonus based upon how quickly you answered, which is called a "speed bonus". If you answer no, there is no point value associated with it, but you still get a speed bonus. The game ends when a player reaches the target point value.<n><n>For example, if the target is 10, then it should take at least four tries to reach or exceed the target. If your first answer is yes, your second answer should be no, third answer yes, fourth answer no, fifth answer yes, and your sixth answer should be no. This way, you will have reached your goal three times with an extra two points.<n><n>If you answer no to a question that costs 5 points, then you still receive a speed bonus of 1.<n><n>You start at the beginning of the game and pick where you start each turn (the first player must start at the beginning of their turn).<n><n>### Task 1<n><n>### Instructor Feedback<n><n>### Solution<n><n>### Task Summary<n>* [x] Check the answer with the solution<n>

He has a lot of what? Choices:  A: laughter B: being happy C: glee D: opera E: injuries<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Justification:A: is not the correct definition of glee.<n>B: is not the correct meaning of being happy.<n>C: is not the correct description of laughter.<n>D: is not a type of opera.<n>E: is the correct name of being hurt.<n><n>### Discussion:<n>This answer is correct. In glee, a person sings in a way where words are misstretched or changed to sounds that give some humor to the word. Therefore, glee and humor are related. In happiness, a person feels joy. If glee and hapiness have a relationship, then glee and joy must have a relationship.  Therefore, the happiness of a person can be expressed with glee. In laughter, a person expresses himself by opening and closing his lips, using hand movements, and even shaking a bit. In injuries, a person receives pain and hurt because of his or her mistakes or negligence. With these three definitions, it is true that we cannot say that happiness has to be performed with glee.<n><n>### Input<n>In order to pass his driving test, he needs to show that he knows all the traffic laws and signs.<n><n>The first step is to memorize the signs, because each type has a different meaning.<n><n>Then you must learn their use. <n><n>Finally you must be very attentive to the traffic that goes around you, because driving requires skill and good judgment.<n><n>### Response<n><n>The person needs to study the traffic laws of his country and memorize the traffic signs. After that, he needs to know how to apply the traffic laws on the road and how to read signs. In doing so, he needs a lot of time and concentration.<n><n>### Justifcation<n>If a person wants to pass a test, he must have studied the material and know how to apply it in a given situation.

When no value is given, use $0.<n><n>The instruction at a specific index may be completed in different ways--for example, an instruction asking the user to enter one dollar may take the input of $1 or undefined, and an instruction asking the user for a number may be satisfied by typing '5'.

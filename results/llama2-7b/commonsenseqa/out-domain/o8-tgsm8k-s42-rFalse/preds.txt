Some restaurants may only have basic, inexpensive options such as a plain salad with vinaigrette, while others may offer more elaborate and higher-priced options.<n><n>If the tip is limited, the most important factor in determining the appropriate tip is the quality of the salad.  This includes the components (such as whether it is fresh or canned), size of the plate, quantity, and overall presentation.<n><n>If the budget is not limited, the more upscale options tend to offer higher-quality salads, so for a higher-quality salad, a tip closer to 15-20% is appropriate. <n><n>If the budget isn't limited, the larger the salad and/or the more elaborate the components, the larger the tip should be. <n><n>If it is possible to afford 20%, the tip should be 20%. <n><n>For a larger plate (usually about 16oz or 19oz), the tip should be 15%.<n><n>For 1 to 25 cents, the tip should be rounded to 5 cents.<n><n>For a medium plate (usually about a 12oz plate with fewer items), the tip will be 10 to 18%.<n><n>**15% is typically an appropriate tip for a restaurant that only offers a plain salad with vinegarette.**<n><n>**20% is typically an appropriate for a restaurant that offers both basic and more elaborate options.**<n><n>**If it is possible to support a 25% tip, the restaurant will probably offer a better quality choice, such as a grilled salad with multiple components (tomatoes, avocado, asparagus, etc.)**<n><n>### Input3: If you buy a lottery ticket would you rather win $60 for sure or a chance that you might win the jackpot?<n><n>### Input4:You found a 50% discount in store A.

Choices:  A: garbage can B: military C: jewelry store D: safe E: airport<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>*If the passenger used a drawstring bag to travel, then she may intend to travel to a jewelry store. So her destination is jewelry store*.<n><n>### Input<n>A plane that could fly nonstop from New York to Paris required 5 gallons of gasoline for every 100 miles flown. A plane that flew from New York to Montreal required 12 gallons of gasoline every 1000 miles flown, and a plane that flew from Toronto to Washington D.C. required 10 gallons of gasoline 100 miles travelled. If the same plane flew to each city, how much gasoline would it burn in order to fly nonstop from NewYork to Toronto, and how many miles did the plane fly?.<n><n>*If the plane flies to Toronto from New York nonstop, then it must fly directly from New York to Toronto, leaving aside the fuel consumption rate because the plane stops only to refuel. So for that plane to stop in New York, its distance is 8061 kilometers. This is equal to 8061/100 miles=80.61. Since the plane stops to refuel to reach to Montreal, 1.5 gallons of gas per 100 miles, thus it needed 120 gallons to refuel. The consumption is 120/12. So 12.5 km per gallon. From Montreal the plane went to Toronto so the plane went to Toronto, since it would be refueling before reaching Toronto. The plane should travel 208.71 km from Montreal, and after that Toronto is 690,000 kilometers. So the plane would cover 208.4 kilometers if travelling directly from Montreal to Toronto.*<n>

The reason for me changing the verb is this because there were no context clues to imply a certain type of verb or pronoun such as that of a singular or plural. As for the change from 'n' to 'ar' is because of the pronoun meaning of a singular or plurality of that word.<n><n>### Reference:<n><n>### Book:<n>Cole, R. (2017). Craft and best by rick cole.

A box of 30 cans is $8.80.  If the price for each addition box of pop is $2.50 more than the price for the box before, which is the most economical?<n><n>### Response :<n>- What is the price per box when you buy two box's?<n><n>- So my answer should include that the price of buying one box is $9.40, but then also consider the price is per box. If I buy one box that is $19.45, when I buy two boxes that price turns in to be $8.83.<n><n>- Buy two boxes of cans instead of one, you can save $2.45.

Choices:  A: roof B: corner C: school building D: wall E: cupboard<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Rationale: The student is asked for a solution to a problem that needs the shelf to be fixed so it would not collapse by itself. This situation shows how someone will be hurt because something could fall down even though it seems unstable to the observer. The correct answer is Choice C because the student can point out the corner of the shelf because the student notices that it is a structure and needs a support. The student will be able to help keep the object from falling to where the person can walk through it like a wall.<n><n>### InputThe student will be paid $1.35 per pound when they move an entire room from one apartment to another. The student works 300 hour weeks and earns enough money to move a whole room from one apartment into the next apartment. Is the student paid enough for how much time they work? Choices:  Yes  No  Depends on the hourly rate of pay  I don’t know<n><n>### ResponseY<n><n>### Rational: The student was asked whether they were paid enough after working a certain number of hours for a certain duration. It does not matter what the student wants out of it, as they are supposed to help move the room from an apartment to another apartment. This question gives no background on why or if the person asked was a helper or owner of the apartment the room is moving. I think the most logical response is Yes because the person getting paid per pound is not paying the full amount to someone for helping move an apartment room. This would mean the owner of the apartment either hired no one or did it on their own or maybe there is no apartment room to move. I do not know the full situation but only a few bits of information about it and the student’s response of yes is logical.<n><n>### Question: A student is buying an apple. It costs $1 for 102 apples!

Favors are not something that we expect in our relationships, that's why being helpful should be done in an unconditional way. If you expect return from your kindness this is no longer a favor, this is something else.  You may want to be treated fair and that's totally acceptable. If you are not being treated fair then you may want to speak about it with another person who can help you to be treated the way you deserve.<n>

Choices:  A: relaxation B: good things in life C: admiration D: own house E: needs money<n><n>### Response:		For every 12 can that I recycle, I will get money back. How much money I get depends on how much I recycle.<n>If you recycle 12 cans, you get $0.50 back. If you recycle more cans, you get more money. As we all know that 12 cans are about 3 kilograms. Three kilograms are equal to 3000 gram. $0.50 is written as 0.5 dollar. For every 3000gram that you recycle, you will get $0.5dollar. So for every 300 gram, you will get $2 1/3 dollar.<n>If you recycled 3600 gram which are 3.6 kilograms, you will get money worth of $15. The calculation is done by multiplying 3000kg by 0.5dollar, which is ($3000 x 0.5 dollars = 15 dollars).<n><n><n>If you recycld 4800 kilo gram of can, (3.6 x 1.3333=4.8)you will get approximately $16.8dollars.<n><n>Since you got $0.50 for 3000, you get a total of 15x0.5=$7.5 dollars. If you do the calculations, you will get $16.5 dollars.<n><n>The total of money you will get back if you recycled 144 can is($16.5 + $7.5 = 24dollar).<n><n>### Instructions: <n><n>Create a program that has instructions for all 7 problems. <n><n>### Your answers:<n><n>#### Input: Why might a person take a  vacation?

If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.<n>Answer: 30<n><n>### Input:Can you name a good reason for attending school? Choices:  A: get smart B: boredom C: colds and flu D: taking tests E: spend time<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I can tell you a good reason for attanding school. I think school is more important than ever in these days. School can help you learn how to communicate, learn how to handle anger, how to live in society etc. There's no denying that school is important for a student who wants to keep up with his/her peers or even exceed his/her peers. The benefits that I will highlight in the following will explain clearly why I think school is important. <n><n>First of all, learning how to communicate is probably the number one reason why I think attending school is of utmost importance. In a nutshell, this means the ability to share ideas, thoughts, information, opinions, views and emotions. Communication is the act of sending a message or the skill of communicating. Communication skills are extremely important in a child's academic, personal, and future work life. It helps children learn to work together and cooperate with other children. It also helps children learn to share ideas and information with others. Communication skills also help children develop empathy, which is important in all aspects of life. <n><n>Secondly, learning how to handle anger is also another reason that I think attending school important. Nowhere is anger more critical and more often the cause of stress. School can help you better recognize what triggers your anger, understand what anger feels like, and manage your anger in ways that don't hurt you or others. <n><n>Last but surely not least, living in a society is another good reason to attend school. In our modern society, we live our lives through many social institutions of families, churches, schools, clubs, businesses, governments, communities and neighborhoods. I also want to emphasis that in order to be an active member of this ever-changing society, we all need to learn to interact in a positive way at work and at home. School helps you stay motivated and encourages you to put your best foot forward.<n><n>### Reference:<n><n>https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=14&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj33v6C6-bjAhULJzQKHQ2xCA8QFjADegQIAhAC&us

Choices:  A: train station B: bookstore C: newsstand D: waiting room E: airport<n><n>### Response:		<n>You need a magazine to read while waiting for your transport to arrive. We don't know if this is a bus stop or not. If it's at an airport, you might want to read a news magazine to learn what's going on in the world. If it's a station for a subway or a train, you can pick up a book at a bookstore, since they often sell the magazine that matches the name of the station, and that would make the wait less boring. You can also buy a new or used book at a used bookstore. At least one used bookstore has a waiting room with magazines to read, even if you don't want to buy a book. The magazine might have coupons for another business near by, for more fun or more information on how to have a good time with your family.<n><n>### Input 2:A car can drive 25 miles on 1,380 milliliters of gasoline.

So, 1380 x 18 =?<n><n>### Response 2:<n>I need 1380 milliliter of fuel per mile, so with 1380.1386, 18 for one mile. So, I need 3.25 and 1,225 million milliliters.  The car can travel 25 miles on a tank of one and three-quarters gallon of fuel. So, I need another tank of gasoline that holds 1.5 gallons.  I need at least one tank that holds 2,360 milliliters. And I need one tank that can hold 5,080 millilitres. The only one that can hold 2360 milliliter is 3 gallons. So, the only one that can hold more than three is 5 gallons. So I need at least 5 gallons of gasoline to add to your tank.<n><n>### Output:<n>Here's your second question, now to respond

Choices:  A: injury B: beauty C: late D: mistakes E: annoyed<n><n>### Response:		<n>When the grooming takes longer than the time given for the next appointment, the groomer is able to use her free time by washing dogs' teeth. This way the dogs do not end up getting a dental disease. The grooming will also give more time to clean the kennel.<n><n>### Input/Response:<n>Today is the day of the grooming. The groomer has 12 dogs scheduled to get groomed. It takes her 30 minutes to groom each dog. The grooming process is to get the dog's nails trimmed, clean the dog's ears, get rid of the ticks on the dogs and give them a bath. For a smooth flow, the grooming process requires you to trim and clean the two dogs in the grooming room at the same time. You're given extra time to clean the kenne before the grooming starts. How long will the grooming process take, from start to finish?<n><n>### Answer:<n>The grooming process will take 2 hours and 45 minutes.<n><n>### Explain:<n>The groomer starts with 2 dogs in the grooming rooms. She has 1 hour to complete the process for the two dogs. This requires that each dog has a 30 minute wait time in the grooming room. This makes a total of 60 minutes that was to be utilised in the grooming process. She has used 30 minutes for the first dog and 30 minutes for another. At this point she has 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete the process. In order to make the grooming process efficient and smooth she needs to groom the next two dogs in the groomings room. This will require another 30 minutes in the grooming room, so the groomer will take about 30 minutes to clean the next two dogs together. This is because she needs to trim and clean their nails, ears and give each dog a bath. The baths of the two dogs each take about an hour, so once they are done the groomer will make an hour and15 minutes to groom the last 4 dogs. When she does this in the grooming rooms, it will take another 30 minutes to finish because they need each dog to have a bath.<n><n>### Response to Input:<n>Give a response to the input below.<n><n>In one

Choices:  A: work hard B: slow down C: wear shoes D: sell products E: speed up<n><n>### Response:		<n>I would tell Ali to work hard or slow down as they do not go hand in hand. One does not have to work hard in order to make progress at the same rate as that of a person working hard and slow down is required to slow down if moving at speed.  One thing I understand from this question is that there are more questions than choices thus it is better to look at it in different angles before choosing the best answer.<n><n>### Input<n>Input: A dog is at the groomers, but the groomer is ill and can't come in today. What will the dog do all day? Choices: A: go to the groomers B: chase cars C: stay home with the children D: clean the house E: go to the park<n><n>### Response<n>I would tell Ali what he should do in case such a situation occur so that he do not spend most of the day at the park playing with the kids. The dog might start feeling bad because it will spent most of its time outside than inside the house thus it might get hungry while we are busy playing since all of us might not be active at the same time since some of us might be indoors doing various tasks such as playing with others who are inside thus such a dog should stay home with the children. To avoid hunger I would advise Ali to feed the dog food.<n><n>### Your answers should be grammatically correct<n>

For example, a person's mouth may move when speaking. The movement of the mouth when a person speaks is not the verb that describes the action that is performed. The verb that correctly describes the action that is being performed is "Speaks". In this case, the instrument/s are not the "mouth", but the "speech" (or in another sense "speech production" or "Speaks") is the verb.<n><n>### For example: a person might "lick" your face or "lick" ice cream. The instrument "the tongue" is not the verb. The verb is "licks."<n><n>### Noun: Nouns, in general, cannot be verbs.<n><n>### Answer:E<n><n>## Instruction: What makes you think that?<n><n>### Instruption:Write your answer in 300-400 words. Use full sentences.<n><n>### I think that the answer is E.<n><n>### What makes it E?<n><n>### Some animals have special organs that are used to produce sound. The name of an animal for this organ is "lungs." Lungs are organs that are used in both mammals and non-lungs, and mammals and nonmammals. Lungs in nonmammals, like reptiles, are called lungs even though they are called "trachea." Therefore, it would not be correct to say that lungs are a common, everyday ordinary animal. Lions are mammals that have lungs. Lungs are organs

{"text": "You go to the jewelry box.\n\n### Input 2:What is a good tip for a restaurant that serves salade?\n\n### Response 2: It depend on many factors like budget, amount spent.\n\n### Response explanation:\n\nWhen answering this question, it is important to think about the salads.  Some restaurants may only have basic, inexpensive options such as a plain salad with vinaigrette, while others may offer more elaborate and higher-priced options.\n\nIf the tip is limited, the most important factor in determining the appropriate tip is the quality of the salad.  This includes the components (such as whether it is fresh or canned), size of the plate, quantity, and overall presentation.\n\nIf the budget is not limited, the more upscale options tend to offer higher-quality salads, so for a higher-quality salad, a tip closer to 15-20% is appropriate. \n\nIf the budget isn't limited, the larger the salad and/or the more elaborate the components, the larger the tip should be. \n\nIf it is possible to afford 20%, the tip should be 20%. \n\nFor a larger plate (usually about 16oz or 19oz), the tip should be 15%.\n\nFor 1 to 25 cents, the tip should be rounded to 5 cents.\n\nFor a medium plate (usually about a 12oz plate with fewer items), the tip will be 10 to 18%.\n\n**15% is typically an appropriate tip for a restaurant that only offers a plain salad with vinegarette.**\n\n**20% is typically an appropriate for a restaurant that offers both basic and more elaborate options.**\n\n**If it is possible to support a 25% tip, the restaurant will probably offer a better quality choice, such as a grilled salad with multiple components (tomatoes, avocado, asparagus, etc.)**\n\n### Input3: If you buy a lottery ticket would you rather win $60 for sure or a chance that you might win the jackpot?\n\n### Input4:You found a 50% discount in store A.

{"text": "*If the passenger used a drawstring bag to travel, then she may intend to travel to a jewelry store. So her destination is jewelry store*.\n\n### Input\nA plane that could fly nonstop from New York to Paris required 5 gallons of gasoline for every 100 miles flown. A plane that flew from New York to Montreal required 12 gallons of gasoline every 1000 miles flown, and a plane that flew from Toronto to Washington D.C. required 10 gallons of gasoline 100 miles travelled. If the same plane flew to each city, how much gasoline would it burn in order to fly nonstop from NewYork to Toronto, and how many miles did the plane fly?.\n\n*If the plane flies to Toronto from New York nonstop, then it must fly directly from New York to Toronto, leaving aside the fuel consumption rate because the plane stops only to refuel. So for that plane to stop in New York, its distance is 8061 kilometers. This is equal to 8061/100 miles=80.61. Since the plane stops to refuel to reach to Montreal, 1.5 gallons of gas per 100 miles, thus it needed 120 gallons to refuel. The consumption is 120/12. So 12.5 km per gallon. From Montreal the plane went to Toronto so the plane went to Toronto, since it would be refueling before reaching Toronto. The plane should travel 208.71 km from Montreal, and after that Toronto is 690,000 kilometers. So the plane would cover 208.4 kilometers if travelling directly from Montreal to Toronto.*", "answer": "E: airport"}

{"text": "Answer:\n\nB\n\nI will explain why my answer is correct.\n\nMy answer is correct because it is the only statement that accurately completes the tasks with no discrepancies or any irrelevant suggestions. In the book, my answer would actually be correct because the book states how to correctly define the task but this answer would not fit in the book because it goes into other aspects of what is given in the task not to be discretionary in the first place.\n\nMy original answer was incorrect because in my answer it tells how to change the text on any of the statements such as changing from the verb 'is' to 'are', and 'n' to 'r'. The reason for me changing the verb is this because there were no context clues to imply a certain type of verb or pronoun such as that of a singular or plural. As for the change from 'n' to 'ar' is because of the pronoun meaning of a singular or plurality of that word.\n\n### Reference:\n\n### Book:\nCole, R. (2017). Craft and best by rick cole.

{"text": "You must place your coffee mug on the shelf after it is dry.\n\n### Input\nWhere did Sara's brother put her coat? A: on the porch floor B: on the floor C: on a chair D: under the chair\n\n### Response\nSara's brother put the coat on the floor.\n\n### Solution\n> **Follow the task instructions** - It helps to understand the instruction or the rule of the task.\n\n> **Read the question carefully** - It is very important to know exactly what the question is asking. If you do not, you may misunderstand the question or not answer the problem correctly.\n\n> **Don't rush** - It's easy to feel rushed when you are taking the computerized test. Don't rush until you understand the question and think it through carefully.\n\n> **Use the mouse** - Mouse is used to mark the answer for multiple choice questions. It is better to click the mouse than to use keyboard to mark the answer. Sometimes the text box which contain the answer will suddenly disappear before you complete the task, so you'd better select the text box to mark the answer.\n\n> **Remember, you can take your time** - You can take as much time as you need for you to find the answer. \n\n> **Don\u2019t be afraid of making mistakes** - Do not worry if you mistakenly mark \u201cB\u201d as \u201cA\u201d or \u201cC\u201d as \u201cB\u201d. If you choose to take the test again, you can simply select another question.  \n\n> **Take a deep breath** - Breathe out any stress you might have and try to stay calm. Taking a deep breath helps to clear your mind. Deep breathing for two to three minutes also helps to refresh your mind.\n\n> **Be prepared to explain your answer**- Before you actually begin answering the question, take some time to explain to yourself exactly what you've decided to do, write down why you took that action, and plan ahead in case you need to explain your answer. For some of the multiple choice questions, you need to remember the reason why one answer is correct. Otherwise, you can't explain why you choose other answers.\n\n## Tutorials\n\nTutorials here\n\n- [Tutorial-1, Logical Reasoning](https://github.com", "answer": "A: shelf"}

This situation shows how someone will be hurt because something could fall down even though it seems unstable to the observer.

The student will be able to help keep the object from falling to where the person can walk through it like a wall.\n\n### InputThe student will be paid $1.35 per pound when they move an entire room from one apartment to another. The student works 300 hour weeks and earns enough money to move a whole room from one apartment into the next apartment. Is the student paid enough for how much time they work? Choices:  Yes  No  Depends on the hourly rate of pay  I don\u2019t know\n\n### ResponseY\n\n### Rational: The student was asked whether they were paid enough after working a certain number of hours for a certain duration. It does not matter what the student wants out of it, as they are supposed to help move the room from an apartment to another apartment. This question gives no background on why or if the person asked was a helper or owner of the apartment the room is moving. I think the most logical response is Yes because the person getting paid per pound is not paying the full amount to someone for helping move an apartment room. This would mean the owner of the apartment either hired no one or did it on their own or maybe there is no apartment room to move. I do not know the full situation but only a few bits of information about it and the student\u2019s response of yes is logical.\n\n### Question: A student is buying an apple.

{"text": "I can tell you a good reason for attanding school. I think school is more important than ever in these days. School can help you learn how to communicate, learn how to handle anger, how to live in society etc. There's no denying that school is important for a student who wants to keep up with his/her peers or even exceed his/her peers. The benefits that I will highlight in the following will explain clearly why I think school is important. \n\nFirst of all, learning how to communicate is probably the number one reason why I think attending school is of utmost importance. In a nutshell, this means the ability to share ideas, thoughts, information, opinions, views and emotions. Communication is the act of sending a message or the skill of communicating. Communication skills are extremely important in a child's academic, personal, and future work life. It helps children learn to work together and cooperate with other children. It also helps children learn to share ideas and information with others. Communication skills also help children develop empathy, which is important in all aspects of life. \n\nSecondly, learning how to handle anger is also another reason that I think attending school important. Nowhere is anger more critical and more often the cause of stress. School can help you better recognize what triggers your anger, understand what anger feels like, and manage your anger in ways that don't hurt you or others. \n\nLast but surely not least, living in a society is another good reason to attend school. In our modern society, we live our lives through many social institutions of families, churches, schools, clubs, businesses, governments, communities and neighborhoods. I also want to emphasis that in order to be an active member of this ever-changing society, we all need to learn to interact in a positive way at work and at home. School helps you stay motivated and encourages you to put your best foot forward.\n\n### Reference:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=14&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj33v6C6-bjAhULJzQKHQ2xCA8QFjADegQIAhAC&us", "answer": "A: get smart"}

{"text": "When the grooming takes longer than the time given for the next appointment, the groomer is able to use her free time by washing dogs' teeth. This way the dogs do not end up getting a dental disease. The grooming will also give more time to clean the kennel.\n\n### Input/Response:\nToday is the day of the grooming. The groomer has 12 dogs scheduled to get groomed. It takes her 30 minutes to groom each dog. The grooming process is to get the dog's nails trimmed, clean the dog's ears, get rid of the ticks on the dogs and give them a bath. For a smooth flow, the grooming process requires you to trim and clean the two dogs in the grooming room at the same time. You're given extra time to clean the kenne before the grooming starts. How long will the grooming process take, from start to finish?\n\n### Answer:\nThe grooming process will take 2 hours and 45 minutes.\n\n### Explain:\nThe groomer starts with 2 dogs in the grooming rooms. She has 1 hour to complete the process for the two dogs. This requires that each dog has a 30 minute wait time in the grooming room. This makes a total of 60 minutes that was to be utilised in the grooming process. She has used 30 minutes for the first dog and 30 minutes for another. At this point she has 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete the process. In order to make the grooming process efficient and smooth she needs to groom the next two dogs in the groomings room. This will require another 30 minutes in the grooming room, so the groomer will take about 30 minutes to clean the next two dogs together. This is because she needs to trim and clean their nails, ears and give each dog a bath. The baths of the two dogs each take about an hour, so once they are done the groomer will make an hour and15 minutes to groom the last 4 dogs. When she does this in the grooming rooms, it will take another 30 minutes to finish because they need each dog to have a bath.\n\n### Response to Input:\nGive a response to the input below.\n\nIn one", "answer": "C: late"}

{"text": "You go to the jewelry box.\n\n### Input 2:What is a good tip for a restaurant that serves salade?\n\n### Response 2: It depend on many factors like budget, amount spent.\n\n### Response explanation:\n\nWhen answering this question, it is important to think about the salads.  Some restaurants may only have basic, inexpensive options such as a plain salad with vinaigrette, while others may offer more elaborate and higher-priced options.\n\nIf the tip is limited, the most important factor in determining the appropriate tip is the quality of the salad.  This includes the components (such as whether it is fresh or canned), size of the plate, quantity, and overall presentation.\n\nIf the budget is not limited, the more upscale options tend to offer higher-quality salads, so for a higher-quality salad, a tip closer to 15% - 20% could be appropriate.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe found [this](https://practicalpie.com/gift-guide-guide-salad-lover/)\n\n### Input2:How does one measure the size of a choker?\n\n###Response2:There are several ways to measure a choker.

A plane that could fly non-stop from Montreal to London required 35 gallons of gas for every 10,000 miles flown, and 30 gallons of fuel was required for every 10 miles flown from Montreal to Boston. How many miles could be flown nonstop from Montreal to Paris if the maximum range of the plane is 5,000 miles?\n\n### Response\n\nBy using these equation to figure out how many gallons of fuel the plane needed.\n\n1:5,000 / 30 gallons \u2248 100 miles / gal = 200 miles\n\n1:10,00 / 35 gallons \u2248 666 miles / gal\n\nIn the given case, the distance from Montreal to London is 4769.05 miles. But the distance to reach to Montreal to Paris is 5000 miles. That means it requires 100 miles per gallon for that. Because if 5000 distance can't be completed with 35 gallons.

We can change the learning process so that students feel more confident with the subject, so we can help students feel that what they are learning in school is fun and interesting, instead of something painful and boring.\n\n### Input;Isn't it important for students to have fun when learning? Choices: A: Yes B: No\n\n### Response;\nI think it is important for students to have a great time when learning. When learning is fun, students are more creative, they can think more, they do not have to stress about things and they tend to do their best work.\n\n### Answer:Would you change the learning process for every single student. Choices: A: yes B: no C: maybe\n\n### Response No,\nI don't think we should change the learning process for each student. Maybe some students want to learn a subject differently and that is why sometimes teachers will help students with something different than what the students ask, but I think we shouldn't just change the learning process for all students. Sometimes students have to pay attention and learn more independently so we should teach them how to do it or with someone who will help them if they need help with it.\n\n### Choose one strategy in this chapter to support learning: Choices: A: Learning the first time. B: Retrieving. C: Recalling. D: Studying actively. E: Elaborating. F: Practicing. G: Evaluating. H: Applying. I: Extending learning. J: Writing and Speaking. K: Sharing with others\n\n### Response J:Writing and Speaking\n\n### AnswerJ; How does writing and speaking support learning? Choices:A: Writing and speaking is about the learner or the students. B: Writing and Speaking is a process you and the students can do together. C: Students might get confused what to do. D: Writing and Speaking helps people to learn through repetition. E: Writing and Speaking let the teacher know whether the students are learning or not.\n\n### Response The students can learn to process if they use writing and speaking and in this way they'll be", "answer": "B: fun"}

So in these situations you would want to subtract the amount of one because that's the closest, and when you want it to get far from 1.00 you subtract the biggest number possible.\n\n### Input :How do we make sure we answer our question and don't cheat?\n\n### Response :", "answer": "A: toy store"}

There are some more small red, blue, green and yellow marbles in the box, each of which has a number written on it. It is not allowed to put a new marble of a different color on the pile. The aim is to arrange as many marbles as possible after having taken an arbitrary number of them. Now the following sequence is possible:\n\n1. Red (take)\n2. Yellow (take)\n3. Blue (take)\n4. Red (put)\n\n### Task Description\n\nIn this game, you are given a sequence containing a series of statements that you can answer yes or no to. Each statement has an associated point value with higher-scoring statements being more difficult and time-consuming, but also more valuable. If you answer yes to a question, you get the associated point value plus a bonus based upon how quickly you answered, which is called a \"speed bonus\". If you answer no, there is no point value associated with it, but you still get a speed bonus. The game ends when a player reaches the target point value.\n\nFor example, if the target is 10, then it should take at least four tries to reach or exceed the target. If your first answer is yes, your second answer should be no, third answer yes, fourth answer no, fifth answer yes, and your sixth answer should be no. This way, you will have reached your goal three times with an extra two points.\n\nIf you answer no to a question that costs 5 points, then you still receive a speed bonus of 1.\n\nYou start at the beginning of the game and pick where you start each turn (the first player must start at the beginning of their turn).\n\n### Task 1\n\n### Instructor Feedback\n\n### Solution\n\n### Task Summary\n* [x] Check the answer with the solution", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

In glee, a person sings in a way where words are misstretched or changed to sounds that give some humor to the word. Therefore, glee and humor are related. In happiness, a person feels joy. If glee and hapiness have a relationship, then glee and joy must have a relationship.  Therefore, the happiness of a person can be expressed with glee. In laughter, a person expresses himself by opening and closing his lips, using hand movements, and even shaking a bit. In injuries, a person receives pain and hurt because of his or her mistakes or negligence. With these three definitions, it is true that we cannot say that happiness has to be performed with glee.\n\n### Input\nIn order to pass his driving test, he needs to show that he knows all the traffic laws and signs.\n\nThe first step is to memorize the signs, because each type has a different meaning.\n\nThen you must learn their use. \n\nFinally you must be very attentive to the traffic that goes around you, because driving requires skill and good judgment.\n\n### Response\n\nThe person needs to study the traffic laws of his country and memorize the traffic signs. After that, he needs to know how to apply the traffic laws on the road and how to read signs. In doing so, he needs a lot of time and concentration.\n\n### Justifcation\nIf a person wants to pass a test, he must have studied the material and know how to apply it in a given situation.

This does not matter; when you use the input $* for an instruction that requires an answer to be typed, that should still be replaced by the expected answer of $120 at the end of the execution.\n\nNote on the order of instructions: When you write your solution to this task, the instructions should come in order.  For example, an instruction asking for the number of dollars should *not* take input prior to instructions asking for numbers.  Instructions that take input with values that should be considered undefined should come *before* instructions that require a number.\n\n### Example Solution\n\n```py\ndef solution():\n    #Write your solution here:\n    print(\"\\nThis script has no solution yet.\")\n```", "answer": "D: farm yard"}

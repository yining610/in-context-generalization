More time allows the student to focus their mind on the subject being studied and understand concepts faster.\n\nQuestion: What is the best way to learn a difficult subject\n\nAnswer: The fastest way to study a difficult subject is to study for a long period of time.  This is because students have plenty of time to practice as much as possible before being able to write it down on paper.  It allows students to develop better understanding and better memory. As they continue to study the same topic, their understanding of how to solve the problem will slowly improve.\n\nQuestion: How long should one take in order to understand and", "answer": "D: being happy"}

{"idx": 527, "text": "C\n\nInput: A number is written by a combination of nine digits, such as the number written in base 9, so that each digit appears once. The place value of a digit is the power of 10 to which that digit has the same exponent as the exponent of 10 for that position in a number in the usual decimal base. The exponent of 10 is 1 for the ten's place, 10 for the hundred's place, and so on.  So a place value of 2 means that in the right-most position it is twice itself.  The same position in a base 2 number is called the binary exponent.  In base 10, the first nine digits are from 0 (or \"binary 0\") to 9.  In number theory each number has a unique representation with a unique place value. The result is called the unique binary representation of a number, and it is the same for any base.  A number that has a unique representation with 10 digits (the usual decimal base of numbers) is called a decimal number, an alternative representation is called a numeral for convenience of use. This is the number 232 as decimal (10,11,9,1,10,0,0,0), as Roman numeral (MDII), and as Hindu\u2013Arabic or Indian numeral (\u090f\u0968\u0969\u0968).  For simplicity, in the numerology literature, \"digit\" often refers to a place value, for example \"binary digit\" refers to a unique binary representation of a binary-represented decimal number (which is called a \"base-twelve\" number by the way that number is stored in binary form).  A \"digit\" in pure number theory means a \"place\" in an infinite representation, as above. A common method for generating numbers without the use of a calculator is to use the Fibonacci number, named after the Italian mathematican Leonardo Pisano, or Fibonacci from Liber Abaci.\nOutput: B\n\nInput: Each day Mr. Miller buys one pizza for 15 dollars, one pack of cookies for 45 dollars, and one pack of potato chips for 65 dollars.

The integers in the lines of input will always be less than or equal to $900$ and are always different from each other.\n\nThe output must consist of $2$ lines for the each input. The first line of output is the number of possible digits for $N$. If it happens to be zero, there is a case $M=1$ when the number of possible digits $m=1$ and for this $N=0$ so we cannot divide it by any positive integer. Thus, the output will contain a single zero. In this case the output may also be written simply \u201c0\u201d.\n\nThe second line shows how many different digits the number $N$ from the first line uses. The number $N$ is given as an integer.

{"idx": 805, "text": "C\n\n\n\n---Part Two: Explanation\n---\n### Please add explanation about how you came to your solutions for each question\nFor part one, I first looked at the question and saw that 1000 minus 600 is 400. Therefore, I decided to look at each case. In the first case, the 11 days were 110 dollars. In the second case, I counted the 78, 101, and 55 to get a total of 234. I counted the 14 and 8 days to get 36 in the third case, and counted the 60 in the forth case to get 360. Therefore, in part one, the total sum was ((110 + 360) +(36+234) +110 + 60) which equals 730 dollars.\n\nFor part two, it seemed easy to me because in the first case, if the price was 30, then the total will be 300. Therefore, in the second case, if the price is 190, then the total is 30, which makes the answer is (30 + 190) = 220. Therefore, the answer is 220.\n\n---\n### You may be asked to explain your explanation in a phone interview. Can you discuss with the interviewer?\nFor part one, it is not difficult to realize that it is easier to add up than to subtract. I can also add these sums so that if there are two cases, for the first case, I can add 11 days and 110 dollars to get 121. If there are three cases, I can use this idea to add three parts.\n\nFor part 2, the answer is very easy to notice, in fact, the two choices are wrong. If the price is 30, the total will be 50, and they are not on the same scale, I can eliminate them. So it is easy to get 300.\n\n---", "answer": "C: have knowledge"}

For example, if we were to write x+y = 9, then we would write: x is equal to y minus 1. If we were to write, x+y = -3, then we would also write x is equal to y plus 3.\nThese are called variables. Variables are special because they represent an unknown number. So, you can substitute any real value for variables, so long as they stay true to the equation you have written so far.\nFor example, if we plugged in the value 3 for x, then we write the equation 3+y = -3 would simply read: y = -4.\nThis is known as balancing an equation. That is, you substitute a value for a variable so that each side of the equation is equal.\nThe final step is to check your work to see if your equation equals to true.\nOutput: A\n\nInput: A box of Cheerios is sold for $3.25.

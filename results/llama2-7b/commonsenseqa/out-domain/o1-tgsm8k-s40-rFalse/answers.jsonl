{"text": "You would probably buy tickets to an amusement park.\n\nHow to solve:\nThe first rule of solving is to start solving with the last question. That way we know that the program is done checking and outputting answers to the earlier questions.\nThen I wrote a while statement to end the loop when the answer to each question is 20, and added the instruction for each question to increase the variable that holds the total answer by 20, then assign the answer of each question to the variable that holds the variable that holds the answer.\nSo the answer to which ever question is being checked will be the same as the total answer. As you can see the total answer is 200.\nThen the last thing that I did, was to change the first answer to the one that was checked last. That is why it is the 4th question. So my output is 4 which is the last number from the total answer, and it is also the answer of the 4th question because 200 - 20 = 180, the difference of the 200 and the 20, when subtracting the 20 from 200, which is the last question.", "answer": "D: fairgrounds"}

We allow the input to consist of digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and whitespace (space).\n\n### Expected Output:\n\n\nYou must write a Python program that, when it receives one single character as its only input, returns a single character as the output. The character is allowed to be either a digit or a lowercase or uppercase letter. Also remember that this output should be the same length as the input and in the same order as the input!\n\n### Sample Inputs:\n\nThe input to your Python program will be just one character. If it is not the first character, then you should assume that it is part of the string and be mindful of that.\n\n\n### Sample Outputs\n\nThe characters you should expect to see in the samples are the characters that you're allowed use, that is, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.\n\n### Sample Code:\n\n\n1. For each of the above five questions, write a complete test case script that will check your Python program's behavior and output.\n2. Write a Python program that receives and processes the input character and returns the appropriate output.\n    You should be able to test this program for all of the questions.\n\n### Helpful Links:\n- [Python Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)\n- [Python Dictionaries](https://www.", "answer": "C: race track"}

{"text": "A\n\n\n\n## Part 1\n\n* 30 seconds\n\n  * This is my way to explain, in English:\n\n  * You can make expressions with more than two numbers, but if you use the expression as input of another expression, the new expression might be a little longer, for example: 3 * (4 + 2) could be expressed as 3 * (4+2) and this form would be shorter.\n\n  * The answer is B\n\n\n## Part2\n\n### Part 2.1\n\n  * Here we test if a string is a palindrome\n\n  * The base of the first test is in the line `for (int i = 0; i < str2.length(); ++i)` this line tells the system to use the length of the `str2` string to calculate how many times we should do the test. The variable i runs from 0 to str2.length()-1.\n\n  * A is the answer.\n\n### Part2.2\n\n  * The same as before to check a string we need to use the length.\n\n  * Here, `str1` is being compared against `str3`\n\n  * The difference between the first example and this, is that the if blocks have different size and they check for a different part of the strings. In the first example we check for the same position `str1[1] == str3[1]`, in this example we are checking if the strings are the same up until position 7, so `str1[7] == str2[7]`.\n\n  * This part of the example works.\n\n### 31 seconds\n\n  * The expression is a palindrome.\n\n  * This answer is also correct\n\n  * In the second solution we check if all 4 characters are the same except for the one in position 2, so `str2[1] == 'A'` and the two expressions could look something like this:\n\n  * `str1[2] == 'A' && str1[2] == str2[2]` <- this and the rest of the parts I am still not sure how to test for them in code.\n\n  * C is the answer.\n\\", "answer": "A: being understood"}

Here's how this is my best guess:\n// The farmer can only produce one type of plant which can he can either use again or\n// can he can eat, there will only ever be one because there could only be 1 crop and 1 seed crop.\n// So I will say that his plant crop is 1 and it is worth 40 seed crops, so\n// if we need to find the seed crop it is 40.\n// So now I can assume that his plant crop will be worth 10 so it is 40/5=8 now\n// he can grow another plant that can also work with either a plant or seeds.\n// This one is worth 40 times less than the first so 2 is more than half of the last number so it should\n// be 2 times less than 1/2, which is 50/2=25.\n// The total comes to be 55/5.\n```", "answer": "D: seed crops"}

{"text": "Answer: If you're really interested in getting better at this:\n\n1. Do a few. This is the quickest and easiest way to learn a concept, especially when you're in a position where you have to do it a lot.\n2. Take your time. Most interviewers don't expect you to be a super-high-functioning robot-brain from the start, although they do expect that you'll improve over time in terms of being able to learn things you might not necessarily have learned. You should expect a few initial missteps--that's just a part of the process of learning something new--but this will generally get better over the course of your interviews.\n3. Learn from your mistakes. Often, you'll make mistakes where you'll go \"Oh, I forgot about that...\". Often it'll be something that's really just a different way of representing something. That's fine. It's totally fine to say that sometimes something doesn't come to you. The best interviewers I've seen ask questions that allow for a good balance between answering and asking. In my experience, interviewers are very understanding of the fact that programming is a difficult task and not everyone might know the right answers to a given question at a given time.\n4. Be honest--and to a certain degree, authentic. Most interviewers will be honest with you if they think you're asking a bad question and answer honestly if you've asked a good question but they simply don't know the right solution.\n5. Practice. Try solving a few problems online, but make sure the problems you're choosing aren't only from the top of Google results. Try and find ones that are more thoughtful, with an appropriate level of difficulty and a reasonable solution.\n6. Learn about the tools. Learn about the ways of doing problem solving on your own, and learn about the tools that people generally use to interact with computers.\n7. Practice writing out code. A lot of people have told me that they hate writing code, or find it tedious, or have trouble with syntax. I've experienced these things too. One of the best ways I found to improve was by writing code without a computer and getting better at expressing concepts in code in a clear manner. Writing is similar to solving puzzles.

The former will work as p-vectors, while the latter will serve as the rows of the solution matrix. It's pretty easy to obtain these, but the hard part is to solve for x. Once you'll get it, you will apply the solution to the vector b.\n\n# Solution\n- **We need to make sure we have all the values (at least the values we need to know)**. So, in order to go ahead and start the solution, create an empty vector p.\n- Next, we compute p as the result of the multiplication (element-wise) of v and q. This can be done using the `v.dot(q)` method.\n- The matrix we want is the solution to the A X b = 0 (it's a linear system), so in order to get it, we need to multiply it with b.\n- Finally, we apply our solution to b, and get `a = qvec @ b`.", "answer": "D: engine"}

{"text": "The right answer is E.\n\nWe have already worked a \"while\" loops in our previous examples. This program uses a \"while\" loop with an \"else\" statement to make sure the user does not quit the program prematurely and so you will always see the correct answer regardless whether the user gives you the correct answer or not.\n\n-In your program, you must create two boolean values \"IsValid\" and \"isValid\", and you must check if the answer the user gives is valid. \n-If the answer the user gives does not meet the conditions given by the user (eg: a + b == 5 ), then  your \"isValid\" variable must be `True`. Otherwise, it must be `False`. You must use the same if/else statement to check for your other conditions given by the user.\n-When you create your \"if/else\" statements within your \"while\" loop, do not break the \"loop.\" Your user should be prompted (and re-prompted) as they need to be in order to make sure you see a correct answer.  The only time you can  break a \"while\" loop is if your \"while\" loop is an infinite loop. \n-The only other thing we should mention is that within the \"while\" loop, you must use the user feedback you get after the prompt and create another Boolean variable to indicate whether the user got it right.

Using the difference(number of dobermans-number of Schnauzrs) and the number we get, we can determine it is a multiple of 10. Since the number we get is a multiple of 5, that number must be 5.\n2. Since the number was a multiple of 5 that we must have 40 more, which must be the number of schnauzers.\n3. Since the number is a multiple of 3, there must be 16 less dogs. For the number of dogs, we will be subtraction 16 from the 40.\n\n\n\n#### Notes\nCare must be taken when dealing with nested and parent relationships within a collection.

A number divisible by n means that it can be evenly split by the number n. So when a number is divisible by a given number n, there is no remainder. In this part, we are going to use the Euclidean algorithm to see if this statement is true or false.\nLet us examine a few divisible numbers first. For example, is 31 divisible by 2? Yes, we have 31 divided by 2=15.75. 15.75 when divided by 2 has no remainder. There is no remainder, so the divisibility by 2 check succeeds. Is 32 divisible by 3? Yes, it is. Is 41 divisible by 5? Yes, it has a remainder of 1. So this statement is true.\n\nBut 31 is not divisible by 7, because the remainder obtained when the division is done is not 0 but 2. So the statement is false for n=7. Is 50 is divisible by 6? This is a bit tricky, since when we do 50 divided by 6, we end up with two remainders: 1 remainder  and 9 remainder . But if we consider", "answer": "A: demonstration"}

Then check your solution with the program in the editor below.\n#### Solution link:https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattison/23-102/hw4.pdf\n\n#### Instruction :You'll notice that we now have a few instructions for using Python, since that is the language you will be using in the classroom.\n\n#### Question 1: Write a program that counts the number of days in a given month.\nYour program should accept as its input a month between 1 and 12. For example, if the user types \"2\", your program should print the name of the second month. Your program should also print the name of the third month (if it is a leap year) using the same code. Use the library http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html\nto count the months.\n\n#### Question2 :Write a program that counts the words from a text file.\nYour program should read from a text file and put the words in a list that contains the counts for each word.\n\n#### Question3 :Write a program that prints the number of occurrences\nof each character in the string \"Python\". For example, your program should print the following when asked for Python: \"A B C E N P r T X\".\n\n#### Question4: Write a program that prints the nth integer from the Fibonacci series for any n. You should use two arrays (one called fib and the other called a) to do the computing. The dimensions of both arrays should be defined before the call to main. You should call main only once. For your example, main should print: \"The nineth integer in the Fibonnaci series is 1080\".\n\n#### Question5 :Write a program that computes the sum of the first x Fibonacci numbers, where x = the number of integers in the series that you compute: if a user types 5, your program should output 5.

{"text": "cupboard\n\nInstruction:Answer the following  five questions.\n\n# Q1. What are the various types of variables supported in C?\n\nAns:   There are three kinds of variables in C.\n\n1. *Primitive* variables which are defined by the compiler automatically as in int, char etc.\n2. *Declarated* variables which are defined manually are in C.\n3. *Register variables* which are very fast variables. The variables which are located in the computer's memory in such a way when the compiler finds it is most convenient to use it then only it considers it is called register.\n\n\n\n# Q2. How does the compiler convert a source code program into machine instructions?\n\nAns:-\n\nThe compiler basically converts all the tokens and syntax into C language statements (like assignment statements, if-else statements and so on into C statements which can be easily executed by the processor. The processor executes the C statements and the output is displayed on the terminal. The whole process is called compilation.\n\n\n\n\n#  Q3. What are operators in C?\n\n\n\n- *A computer cannot execute any program directly. It has to take help of an interpreter.*\n- To execute the program written in any language like C, we need to write a program in another language called an Interpreter.\n \n# Q4. Why is it called a compiler?\n\nAns :-\n* The program is compiled when it is processed by the compiler and is converted into machine language.\n*The program is called source code or high level language.\n\n# Q5. How are data type and data-item are related to one another?\n\nAns : -\n* Data type is a classification to which all variables are assigned (i.e. integer, float, char, double)\n\n* Data items are the basic units to which any variable is assigned and can have value. For example int is a data type and \u20184\u2019 is a data item.", "answer": "E: cellar"}

At this step, we want the values to be:\n6 - 3 = x - b\nWe can choose 6 = c and b = 9; in this way, when we substitute x = 14 to the original equation, we can get 14 - 33 = 9 - 9 where x = 9.\n\n1.

{"text": "E\n\n#### Challenge:\n- How can we represent the question as an expression?\n- When the question is written as an expression using the variables x, y, and z, we know that the question actually has three expressions within one. That is,\n- (x+y+z)=90\n- (x-y)=a-b\n- (x-z)=a-c\n\nThis will give us the following constraints:\n- x+y+z=90\n- x-y=x-y\n- x-z=x-z\n- (x+20)-z=90\n\nIf we represent the equation with the variables as follows:\n- x=x\n- y=y+1\n- z=z-1\n- n=5\n- m=a-b\n- b=f\n- a=g\n- c=h\n- h=i-j\n\nthen our constraints simplify, and we get n=9, m=4, f=6, g=6, h=1, and i=0.

Each value is a positive integer. Let r be an integer result, which you calculate as follows: r = five less than  three times the sum of these five input values plus the difference between the total of these five inputs and 7. Print out only the value for r, not what you did to get it. (See sample run below.)\n\n#### Sample Run\n\nThe following is a sample run from running your code. Note that the second, third and fourth lines of the sample run should not need to run. \n\n1. Enter the values for each number in the array, except the first line must be a blank line.\n\n2. Enter the values for the numbers in the array.\n\n3. The sum of the five numbers will be used to solve the problem. You do not need to keep track of how you got your answer. (The blank lines are included in the sample run because they are part of a blank line problem.)\n\n4. The sum of the numbers will also be used in the problem. Again, do not keep track of how you found the answer.\n\n5. The rest of the numbers will have to be calculated in order to solve the problem. They are four times the sum of the numbers and three times the number of numbers in the array. Again, do not need to keep a record of these numbers.\n\n6. When you get to this line, replace it with the statement '(reply to your question here)'.\n\n7. Once you have finished your calculation, print out the number 14 and nothing else, to your instructor.\n\nYou have received the following values for the array. Note that each line of the array must be on one line.\n\nEnter the values for each number.\n\nEnter the value for the array.\n\nThe solution can be found after you solve the problem.\nThe values for the array are already known, but for the purpose of the question you need to find out how to work them out.\n\n(See", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}
{"text": "D\n\n---\n\n\n# Solution\n1. First step is define your problem then try to come up with solution. Here I have three variables, $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\n2. There are three operations, $+$,  `-`,and  `*`\n\n## Solution\n$x=5$\n\n$y=3$\n\n$z=(x-y)$ \n\n= $5-3=$1 \n\nSo here we have $x+y-z =90  \\Rightarrow  10 + 7 = 90  \\Rightarrow  x+y-z = 90 \\Rightarrow x-y = 9  \\Rightarrow x+y= 10  \\Rightarrow 10 = y + z \\Rightarrow z=0 \n\nThe value of $y$ can be found using the concept of `Pigeon Hole principle` where there are $3+5$ holes and $4$ pigeons, so $y =3$\n\nTo find $x$ we use `Pigeon hole principle - again` where there are $5+3$ holes and $5$ pigeons. we can substitute some value with the given values, it has $3$ solution where $x=13,14,15$\n\nSo we have $y=3 $ and $x = \\frac{5+3}{2}  \\Rightarrow x=13$ which is a subset.\n\nTherefore $x = 20, y=3, z=0$\n\n## Explanation\n\nTo begin with, we can find the number of dogs of each breed. For the above question\n\n$x+y=z\\Rightarrow y = \\frac{x+y-z}{z} \\Rightarrow$ We get $x=13$. But $550+30-50\\Rightarrow$ So there are $55=20+30$ Dobermans $+50$ Schnauzers so $20+30=55, x = 55, $ $y=30$ and $z=20$\n\n\n```\n2.

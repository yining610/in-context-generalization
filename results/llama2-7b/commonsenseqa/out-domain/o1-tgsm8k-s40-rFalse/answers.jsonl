{"text": "I suppose the most relevant answer here, and the only answer not available, is B, the meeting. However, this answer seems to be a contradiction of how a meeting operates by its nature, as one would be speaking with attendees in a meeting, not writing on a notepad with them. I can be more specific to A in that a paper-based notepad that sits in my back pocket and that I've seen in one of the photos on a website for the brand, could be placed there. I don't quite understand how a drug store would benefit a user needing a notepad as I haven't seen anything from a drug store, where a notepad is sold in a box (as opposed to a convenience or grocery store, where they are sold individually, or at a office supply or electronics store that has larger boxes full of notepads).\n\nD. \"home\" makes no sense, as notepads don't stay where you put them on the kitchen table. Either a paper based notepad, or digital note or memo pad, would not stay on a table, as they could be used, reused and tossed out without much thought to them again. Maybe, if we can place our home address or our home phone number on these notepads, or any reminder whatsoever (a birthday coming up or a family friend getting married), that would be considered an extension of the \"home\", although \"home\" does not really describe where you would buy the notepad for storage.\n\nI suppose if \"home\" was referring to a home (which may be obvious), I'd consider A. But that would also refer to a pocket, which seems more like a \"belt\" location than our personal location. Pants don't stay in your pocket unless you remove items from it and fold them into a crease that you put next to your body. So, the \"home\" in our scenario would be a place that I could keep anything I want in, so, I'd be more inclined to consider A, \"the back pocket\".\n\nHowever, after reading all those words here, I am not convinced that this question makes any sense. We can answer it, but it makes no sense, at least, to me.\n\n### Input::\nI read your suggestion about the meeting, so you're thinking that I can", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

{"text": "```\nA - conference B - theater. C - building D - floor E the church.\nIn order to achieve the response goal, it's required to read the entire sentence first and then apply our reading comprehension. We can know the key words such as `number of Doberman puppy`, `3 times the number of Dobertan puppy`, `difference between the number of Dobertman puiy and the number of Schnuzer`. Then we can answer the question.\n\n## # Explanation of our solution\n### `Solution`\n1. Write a Python function.\n\nThe function should take user-inputed input as an argument.\n\nWrite a function named `answer_question(q)`, where a question is a string. The function returns the response to the question.\n\n```\n\"\"\"\nReturn response to a given question.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef answer_question(question):\n  \"\"\"\n  Returns the response to a given question\n  \"\"\"\n  pass\n```\n\n2. Run `question` for the function and return the result.\n\n`answer_question(question)` = `answer_question(\"Three times the number of Dobernian puppiees is equal to 95. Three times the number of Doberean puppies is equal to 94. The difference between the number of Beagles and the number of Dobermans is equal to 8. The number of beagle is half the number of Dobermania is equal to 40. \")` = `False`\n\n### # Solution Analysis\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide context, we do not really know what it's about. As result, `question` may not be the only way to know if the result is `True` or `False`. For example, if `question` is`the number of Doberman is 80,\" then the result should be `False`, because there is no such number in the sentence.\n\n`answer = False`\nThere is no way to solve the problem. However, since `answer = False`, it may not be `True` or `True`, but it is correct.\n\n\n###### Huge thanks to our mentor @Lunar!!", "answer": "B: theater"}

And if each one of these had at least one bagel they would be the right choice.)\n\nAnswer: First we start by getting the user choices from the menu\n\n    menu('Input bagel responses')\n        option('rich people', 'bagel') 'rich people would never eat a good bagel, since they are the ones who can afford to buy lox and cream cheese for bagels.')\n        option('sleepy', 'bagel')\n        option('plain', 'bagel')           'plain bagel = one that is neither \"sweet\" nor \"stuffed\" or \"cajun\" or in general, neither \"stuffed\" nor \"sweet\" or \"cajund\"')\n        option('needy', 'bagel')   - 'poor people like needy people because they have no jobs, thus they have no money to buy other types of bagels')\n        option('homeless', 'bagel')  - 'homeless people like everyone, except rich people. They don't like poor people because they are not homeless and don't have money, and they don't like needy people because neither of them is homeless.')\n    menu()\n\nNow we prompt the user to respond\n\n    def print_b(x):\n        print str(x) +'b.'\n        if x == 7:\n            quit()\n    print 'Choose a bagel (b). Enter <q> to quit.'\n    print_b(3)\n\n\nIn the code below the user is responding b, it just means they would like some bagels. We then look at the choices chosen to see in what way we should make these the \u201ccorrect\u201d ones.\n\nIf they have chosen a bagel they like we simply display that they must like that one and not another. And if they say they do not choose that one we tell them what they selected.

Computers are not very good at the \u201ccommon sense\u201d thinking needed to make decisions. The computer will not determine which direction of traffic has the right of way at an intersection because the computer does not know which direction it will move into a given intersection, but the computer could determine this if it always faced the same direction towards the intersection. The computer does not know where the stop sign is in relation to the intersection and cannot determine the direction of traffic. For the computer to answer this question correctly, you would have to determine which type of reasoning is needed, what information that needs to be provided to the computer, determine the data sources available to the computer, and the computer\u2019s accuracy in determining a right of way.

{"text": "A: relaxation\n\n### Instructions:\nExperts have identified six critical decision points in writing SQL queries that help ensure that the queries return results that are free of anomalies. In this document, we list the six decision points and the techniques you can use for each decision point.\n\n### Decision Point:\nWhile the syntax of the query language allows you to include multiple conditions in a single clause, this approach can lead to unwieldy code. Because there are many ways to phrase a query to achieve a specific effect, avoid including multiple conditions in a single statement. If you must, use the AND operator on all clauses to require that an object must meet the requirements of every clause in the statement.\n\nThe `EXISTS` operator can be used in an `AND` clause to test if a specific row exists. If the row doesn't exist, then this clause causes the query to stop.\n\n\n### Response Decision Point\n\n**Decision Point:**\nWhile the syntax in SQL allows you to include multiple clauses in the same statement, this practice can result in queries that can be unwieldy and difficult to read. As a matter of practice, a group of rows in the database is selected as a unit. It is important to limit the number of clauses per statement to reduce the chance of having to perform a complex set of actions later to find the cause of a failure. It is also important to limit the number and complexity of the clauses to avoid the possibility of incorrectly omitting a clause.\n\n**Response Decision Point**\nAvoid using multiple clauses in a single statement. It is better to break the query into multiple statements and then execute them as a result set operations.\n\n### Question\n\nWhile writing SQL queries, keep an eye out for any place where additional clauses could be added or removed without interrupting the flow of the query. If the query language used supports regular expressions, it is easy to include multiple clauses as regular expressions, instead of using explicit logical operators.\n\n\n## Task 1:\n### Expecting the output 30\n### Query\n```\nSELECT SUM(total) as 'Sum of Orders'\n        FROM (\n            SELECT SUM(order_total) total\n              FROM orders\n            UNION ALL\n            SELECT SUM(line_total) total\n         FROM item_details,orders", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

When you answer a user\u2019s question with the same question, your bot might come across as argumentative.\n\n2. When a user asks the bot a question, it might not offer an answer, but instead ask a question back that prompts the user to think about the answer.

When you\u2019re able to answer multiple user questions, you can ask additional questions to prompt the user to think. This is a good way to keep a conversation moving.\n\n4.

It is unlikely that reading about science, a subject that is not likely to be understood by someone will have the affect of increasing their knowledge because science is not a subject that is easily understood and it is unlikely that reading about something which is more likely than not to be difficult to understand will increase your knowledge of something when someone reads it.

{"text": "(1) A\n\n### Demostration:\nInput:\n\nI thought this was pretty hard but then in the question asked I had to use the words \"family room\". I looked in the dictionary in a way a lot of people think of which was not helpful at the beginning. (dictionary.com). After I found a description of a \"family room\" which included a: living room, family re, fire place, couches, bookshelf, pictures and then one that was like a home. In the example there is a flower garden, movie theater, and a hair salon. These are not included.\n\nIn the example after looking at a home, and a description of a family room, I started to understand that it was a house and in the house, was a family room. \n\nThis was one of the reasons the question was hard for me because you had to think outside of the box to look at the question from a different view, so to say. I was thinking like an engineer or someone who could figure out how to calculate, and I am not that. This reminds me how not to think when I was trying to solve a problem. I needed for someone to say: Joe thought the plant would look good in the living room, the movie theater, etc. I still did not know if I was looking at a house or an apartment.\n\nThe final result was, I did not know, at first, that I could not use the dictionary in the way I thought. For the first time, I had to use a website that showed a lot of pictures of what a \"family room\" looked like or could look like. That way I could actually search for the correct answer. I knew that I was going to have to look more than one place because that was just how questions on coding.com was.

He is using data for temperature and carbon monoxide, pollutants that can have negative health impacts. Here is the data he needs:\n\nFor a given day, if the temperature was 61 degrees or less he took into account CO levels that were 9 units or less. CO15009\n\nIf the temperature was 62 degrees or more he took into account CO level that have not yet been measured. CO15010\n\nFor days with temperatures between 62-66, Joe recorded data for temperatures above and below 65 degrees. CO62660\n\nAll three groups of data have different conditions that influence the values of CO.\n\nJoe needs to create three data tables with the following columns:\n\n- Weather conditions\n- Number of times each variable takes the condition into account for each of the three data collection categories: CO6266, CO1500, and CO1501\n\nHere's an example of the kind of result Joe was looking for when he enters data.\n\nCO Temperature CO Temperature\n62 3,975 62 313,405\n62 9,400 65 39,374\n63 2,093 65 3,708\n64 1,619 62 1,935\n65 1,246 62 5,859\n65 37,5", "answer": "E: mexico"}

The reduction of error-values will be made according to the x-values and y-values of the input.\n\n\n\n### Code and Output\n\n> code\nFor the demo, I will go over just one of these lines of data.\nThe algorithm will be demonstrated as its written, so I will change the inputs to look more reasonable. I'll take all the inputs in this demonstration, and use them for the first demonstration.\n\nI'll make the error-values in this data-set a little bit closer to my answers than they actually are. The error-values here are about 6, the answers are around 4.5. Also, the y-values (errors) are in the thousands.

However, this answer seems to be a contradiction of how a meeting operates by its nature, as one would be speaking with attendees in a meeting, not writing on a notepad with them. I can be more specific to A in that a paper-based notepad that sits in my back pocket and that I've seen in one of the photos on a website for the brand, could be placed there. I don't quite understand how a drug store would benefit a user needing a notepad as I haven't seen anything from a drug store, where a notepad is sold in a box (as opposed to a convenience or grocery store, where they are sold individually, or at a office supply or electronics store that has larger boxes full of notepads).<n><n>D. "home" makes no sense, as notepads don't stay where you put them on the kitchen table. Either a paper based notepad, or digital note or memo pad, would not stay on a table, as they could be used, reused and tossed out without much thought to them again. Maybe, if we can place our home address or our home phone number on these notepads, or any reminder whatsoever (a birthday coming up or a family friend getting married), that would be considered an extension of the "home", although "home" does not really describe where you would buy the notepad for storage.<n><n>I suppose if "home" was referring to a home (which may be obvious), I'd consider A. But that would also refer to a pocket, which seems more like a "belt" location than our personal location. Pants don't stay in your pocket unless you remove items from it and fold them into a crease that you put next to your body. So, the "home" in our scenario would be a place that I could keep anything I want in, so, I'd be more inclined to consider A, "the back pocket".<n><n>However, after reading all those words here, I am not convinced that this question makes any sense. We can answer it, but it makes no sense, at least, to me.<n><n>### Input::<n>I read your suggestion about the meeting, so you're thinking that I can

Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>A - conference B - theater. C - building D - floor E the church.<n>In order to achieve the response goal, it's required to read the entire sentence first and then apply our reading comprehension. We can know the key words such as `number of Doberman puppy`, `3 times the number of Dobertan puppy`, `difference between the number of Dobertman puiy and the number of Schnuzer`. Then we can answer the question.<n><n>## # Explanation of our solution<n>### `Solution`<n>1. Write a Python function.<n><n>The function should take user-inputed input as an argument.<n><n>Write a function named `answer_question(q)`, where a question is a string. The function returns the response to the question.<n><n>```<n>"""<n>Return response to a given question.<n>"""<n><n>def answer_question(question):<n>  """<n>  Returns the response to a given question<n>  """<n>  pass<n>```<n><n>2. Run `question` for the function and return the result.<n><n>`answer_question(question)` = `answer_question("Three times the number of Dobernian puppiees is equal to 95. Three times the number of Doberean puppies is equal to 94. The difference between the number of Beagles and the number of Dobermans is equal to 8. The number of beagle is half the number of Dobermania is equal to 40. ")` = `False`<n><n>### # Solution Analysis<n><n>Since the problem doesn't provide context, we do not really know what it's about. As result, `question` may not be the only way to know if the result is `True` or `False`. For example, if `question` is`the number of Doberman is 80," then the result should be `False`, because there is no such number in the sentence.<n><n>`answer = False`<n>There is no way to solve the problem. However, since `answer = False`, it may not be `True` or `True`, but it is correct.<n><n><n>###### Huge thanks to our mentor @Lunar!!<n>

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>### Input:A person with brown skin may share that skin with whom? Choices:  A: finger B: good health C: own family D: friends E: people<n><n>### Response:		<n>While the color brown is a shared trait among humans, it is not a shared trait among all living organisms. However, the color of skin is a trait that is present in all humans, including people with brown skin. Therefore, a person with brown skin may also share skin with friends and family, which makes E the best response.<n><n>#### Input:A person may share who with a person? Choices:  (I) A: finger; B: good health; (II) C: own family; D: friends; (III) E: people<n><n>#### Response:<n>Each of the options provided describes a trait that can be shared between two people, which allows the person to share the trait with friends, family members, or even strangers. However, the trait of “brown skin” is unique to the person so it cannot be shared between two people in a physical sense. There are other ways that brown skin can be shared between two human beings. For example, a person who has brown skin may share the trait of brown skin because both people have brown skin. Thus, “people” is the best response.<n>

If there is a theater, people are not laughing but watching a play in a darkened room and so it is a theater. A cabaret would not provide a stage to show a performance but would have music. A conference usually includes presentations but these do not have the type of large screen that would be needed for a projector.

If the computer is off, then the computer doesn't exist. To answer this question we need to know what the computer does throughout a typical day. It will help us determine which option best fits.<n><n>Input:10 minutes after leaving the office, he began driving home and was about to pass by a stop sign at the intersection when _______________.<n><n>### Response<n><n>The computer is not intelligent or aware enough to determine the direction of the traffic in the intersection or to understand what the computer should do next. Computers are not very good at the “common sense” thinking needed to make decisions. The computer will not determine which direction of traffic has the right of way at an intersection because the computer does not know which direction it will move into a given intersection, but the computer could determine this if it always faced the same direction towards the intersection. The computer does not know where the stop sign is in relation to the intersection and cannot determine the direction of traffic. For the computer to answer this question correctly, you would have to determine which type of reasoning is needed, what information that needs to be provided to the computer, determine the data sources available to the computer, and the computer’s accuracy in determining a right of way. The traffic lights on the freeway might determine the direction. We could use a camera facing the traffic signals to determine the signal color to determine the direction of traffic<n><n><n>

In this document, we list the six decision points and the techniques you can use for each decision point.<n><n>### Decision Point:<n>While the syntax of the query language allows you to include multiple conditions in a single clause, this approach can lead to unwieldy code. Because there are many ways to phrase a query to achieve a specific effect, avoid including multiple conditions in a single statement. If you must, use the AND operator on all clauses to require that an object must meet the requirements of every clause in the statement.<n><n>The `EXISTS` operator can be used in an `AND` clause to test if a specific row exists. If the row doesn't exist, then this clause causes the query to stop.<n><n><n>### Response Decision Point<n><n>**Decision Point:**<n>While the syntax in SQL allows you to include multiple clauses in the same statement, this practice can result in queries that can be unwieldy and difficult to read. As a matter of practice, a group of rows in the database is selected as a unit. It is important to limit the number of clauses per statement to reduce the chance of having to perform a complex set of actions later to find the cause of a failure. It is also important to limit the number and complexity of the clauses to avoid the possibility of incorrectly omitting a clause.<n><n>**Response Decision Point**<n>Avoid using multiple clauses in a single statement. It is better to break the query into multiple statements and then execute them as a result set operations.<n><n>### Question<n><n>While writing SQL queries, keep an eye out for any place where additional clauses could be added or removed without interrupting the flow of the query. If the query language used supports regular expressions, it is easy to include multiple clauses as regular expressions, instead of using explicit logical operators.<n><n><n>## Task 1:<n>### Expecting the output 30<n>### Query<n>```<n>SELECT SUM(total) as 'Sum of Orders'<n>        FROM (<n>            SELECT SUM(order_total) total<n>              FROM orders<n>            UNION ALL<n>            SELECT SUM(line_total) total<n>         FROM item_details,orders<n>

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>### Input:How can one's views change after learning about science? Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>It is difficult enough to read and understand all the research material that someone has to gather to be able to answer a question that they don't know the answer to as they read science material because it's not likely that something that has happened to someone reading science material that they don't understand will have the affect of making them learn about nature. It is unlikely that reading about science, a subject that is not likely to be understood by someone will have the affect of increasing their knowledge because science is not a subject that is easily understood and it is unlikely that reading about something which is more likely than not to be difficult to understand will increase your knowledge of something when someone reads it. Therefore it does not seem logical that reading about science will make someone knowledgeable about science or make them understand something about science because they are more likely to understand science if they are educated and not likely to learn about something if they don't understand it or read something that they are more likely to not read because it is not something that they understand.<n>

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>### Input:Joe bought a ficus.  He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n><n>### Response:		(1) A<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input:<n><n>I thought this was pretty hard but then in the question asked I had to use the words "family room". I looked in the dictionary in a way a lot of people think of which was not helpful at the beginning. (dictionary.com). After I found a description of a "family room" which included a: living room, family re, fire place, couches, bookshelf, pictures and then one that was like a home. In the example there is a flower garden, movie theater, and a hair salon. These are not included.<n><n>In the example after looking at a home, and a description of a family room, I started to understand that it was a house and in the house, was a family room. <n><n>This was one of the reasons the question was hard for me because you had to think outside of the box to look at the question from a different view, so to say. I was thinking like an engineer or someone who could figure out how to calculate, and I am not that. This reminds me how not to think when I was trying to solve a problem. I needed for someone to say: Joe thought the plant would look good in the living room, the movie theater, etc. I still did not know if I was looking at a house or an apartment.<n><n>The final result was, I did not know, at first, that I could not use the dictionary in the way I thought. For the first time, I had to use a website that showed a lot of pictures of what a "family room" looked like or could look like. That way I could actually search for the correct answer. I knew that I was going to have to look more than one place because that was just how questions on coding.com was. I had to try it several ways in order to solve the problem.<n><n><n>

After a few minutes of discussion about the study, the experimenter enters the room and the psychologist asks the group how to conduct the experiment; each person writes down their suggestions and the psychologist puts the paper on the floor.  All people are given the same sheet of paper.  The paper will be removed, with one exception: the chief of police will get to keep his paper so he can repeat the experiment for a better understanding of how it is conducted as a demonstration for his staff. The paper is placed in a safe and will not be accessed for the remainder of the study. The paper will be used to determine who will receive the pizza reward, the value of which is 500 Euros.  The pizza will be delivered at the conclusion of the experiment if participants complete all required tasks and make it to the end. At the completion of the experiment, the results will be recorded and distributed to each participant's superior. There will be no discussion about the paper during or after the experiment.  After the experiment, the chief of police will hold a briefing meeting at a time deemed appropriate for all concerned; all present will have an opportunity to discuss the experiment in this forum, thus completing the experiment.

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n><n>### Response:		<n>Your options include A and B only.

Choices: A: pizza B: salad<n><n>### Response<n>Your options include A only. Salad does not have cheese like a pizza.<n><n>### Demo:<n>Input: A 5-year-old child is standing an an angle of 120 degrees. If there is 120 feet of string and the child's arm makes up 50 feet and the string is 70 feet long, how long is the child's arm in feet?<n>Answer: 80 feet<n><n>### Response 2:<n>Your options include B only. If the child's arm is 50 feet and there is 70 feet of string and 120 degrees, the ratio of string to child is 70:50. This means that 1/3 of a 70-foot piece of string is 20 feet. Therefore, for 80 + 20 = 100 feet.

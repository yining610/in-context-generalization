That way we know that the program is done checking and outputting answers to the earlier questions.<n>Then I wrote a while statement to end the loop when the answer to each question is 20, and added the instruction for each question to increase the variable that holds the total answer by 20, then assign the answer of each question to the variable that holds the variable that holds the answer.<n>So the answer to which ever question is being checked will be the same as the total answer. As you can see the total answer is 200.<n>Then the last thing that I did, was to change the first answer to the one that was checked last. That is why it is the 4th question. So my output is 4 which is the last number from the total answer, and it is also the answer of the 4th question because 200 - 20 = 180, the difference of the 200 and the 20, when subtracting the 20 from 200, which is the last question.

Each passenger's total fare consisted of the base $95 fare for the flight and the change fee. The cost function of a trip between two cities is given by f(x) = x^2 + 19.83x - 139.5, where x is the one-way cost and 95+95 is equal to base fare. If the change fee on a given flight is less than the base fare, the function is monotonically increasing. If the fee is greater than the base fare, it is monotonically decreasing. Otherwise, it is constant.<n><n>### Instructions:What are your constraints?<n><n>1. If base fare $<= change fee, then the fee can only be higher.<n>2. If the fee is negative, it cannot be zero.<n><n>### Inputs and outputs<n><n>1. Inputs - Base fare and the new change fee 216 2.

We allow the input to consist of digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and whitespace (space).<n><n>### Expected Output:<n><n><n>You must write a Python program that, when it receives one single character as its only input, returns a single character as the output. The character is allowed to be either a digit or a lowercase or uppercase letter. Also remember that this output should be the same length as the input and in the same order as the input!<n><n>### Sample Inputs:<n><n>The input to your Python program will be just one character. If it is not the first character, then you should assume that it is part of the string and be mindful of that.<n><n><n>### Sample Outputs<n><n>The characters you should expect to see in the samples are the characters that you're allowed use, that is, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.<n><n>### Sample Code:<n><n><n>1. For each of the above five questions, write a complete test case script that will check your Python program's behavior and output.<n>2. Write a Python program that receives and processes the input character and returns the appropriate output.<n>    You should be able to test this program for all of the questions.<n><n>### Helpful Links:<n>- [Python Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)<n>- [Python Dictionaries](https://www.

Choices:  A: being understood B: beer C: playing around D: hug E: visiting friends<n>Output:		A<n><n><n><n>## Part 1<n><n>* 30 seconds<n><n>  * This is my way to explain, in English:<n><n>  * You can make expressions with more than two numbers, but if you use the expression as input of another expression, the new expression might be a little longer, for example: 3 * (4 + 2) could be expressed as 3 * (4+2) and this form would be shorter.<n><n>  * The answer is B<n><n><n>## Part2<n><n>### Part 2.1<n><n>  * Here we test if a string is a palindrome<n><n>  * The base of the first test is in the line `for (int i = 0; i < str2.length(); ++i)` this line tells the system to use the length of the `str2` string to calculate how many times we should do the test. The variable i runs from 0 to str2.length()-1.<n><n>  * A is the answer.<n><n>### Part2.2<n><n>  * The same as before to check a string we need to use the length.<n><n>  * Here, `str1` is being compared against `str3`<n><n>  * The difference between the first example and this, is that the if blocks have different size and they check for a different part of the strings. In the first example we check for the same position `str1[1] == str3[1]`, in this example we are checking if the strings are the same up until position 7, so `str1[7] == str2[7]`.<n><n>  * This part of the example works.<n><n>### 31 seconds<n><n>  * The expression is a palindrome.<n><n>  * This answer is also correct<n><n>  * In the second solution we check if all 4 characters are the same except for the one in position 2, so `str2[1] == 'A'` and the two expressions could look something like this:<n><n>  * `str1[2] == 'A' && str1[2] == str2[2]` <- this and the rest of the parts I am still not sure how to test for them in code.<n><n>  * C is the answer.<n>\<n>

Choices:  A: raise corn B: seed plants C: grow plants D: seed crops E: farm land<n>Output:		seed plants<n><n>### Explanation:<n>```<n>// I wrote the full source code but I will try giving the simplest explanation I can<n><n>// The first one is actually the easiest! Dozer and his master have a total of 20<n>// Doberman puppie's and 30 schnauzers so Dozer's master's total is 30+20=50<n>// Now that we know they have a total of 50 each schnauzer are worth 2x the value of a doberman puppy and<n>// Dozer is worth 2/5th of the value of a doger so...<n>// 25 = 20*2<n>// 5+20 = 20+40<n>// 5 +20 = 30<n>// Dozer is 2nd from the top, which means he is 1/2 way thru this case, so 50-10/5=55<n>```<n><n>I got to the schnauzers in the other question but I don't know how I got 2/5ths because I was only able to get down to the schnauzer<n><n>```<n>// The second one is trickier but it still comes out the same. Here's how this is my best guess:<n>// The farmer can only produce one type of plant which can he can either use again or<n>// can he can eat, there will only ever be one because there could only be 1 crop and 1 seed crop.<n>// So I will say that his plant crop is 1 and it is worth 40 seed crops, so<n>// if we need to find the seed crop it is 40.<n>// So now I can assume that his plant crop will be worth 10 so it is 40/5=8 now<n>// he can grow another plant that can also work with either a plant or seeds.<n>// This one is worth 40 times less than the first so 2 is more than half of the last number so it should<n>// be 2 times less than 1/2, which is 50/2=25.<n>// The total comes to be 55/5.<n>```<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: table B: restaurant C: cupboard D: kitchen E: sink<n>Output:		<n><n>Answer: If you're really interested in getting better at this:<n><n>1. Do a few. This is the quickest and easiest way to learn a concept, especially when you're in a position where you have to do it a lot.<n>2. Take your time. Most interviewers don't expect you to be a super-high-functioning robot-brain from the start, although they do expect that you'll improve over time in terms of being able to learn things you might not necessarily have learned. You should expect a few initial missteps--that's just a part of the process of learning something new--but this will generally get better over the course of your interviews.<n>3. Learn from your mistakes. Often, you'll make mistakes where you'll go "Oh, I forgot about that...". Often it'll be something that's really just a different way of representing something. That's fine. It's totally fine to say that sometimes something doesn't come to you. The best interviewers I've seen ask questions that allow for a good balance between answering and asking. In my experience, interviewers are very understanding of the fact that programming is a difficult task and not everyone might know the right answers to a given question at a given time.<n>4. Be honest--and to a certain degree, authentic. Most interviewers will be honest with you if they think you're asking a bad question and answer honestly if you've asked a good question but they simply don't know the right solution.<n>5. Practice. Try solving a few problems online, but make sure the problems you're choosing aren't only from the top of Google results. Try and find ones that are more thoughtful, with an appropriate level of difficulty and a reasonable solution.<n>6. Learn about the tools. Learn about the ways of doing problem solving on your own, and learn about the tools that people generally use to interact with computers.<n>7. Practice writing out code. A lot of people have told me that they hate writing code, or find it tedious, or have trouble with syntax. I've experienced these things too. One of the best ways I found to improve was by writing code without a computer and getting better at expressing concepts in code in a clear manner. Writing is similar to solving puzzles. To a certain degree, even if you know which

To solve it, you will need to compute pmat and qvec. The former will work as p-vectors, while the latter will serve as the rows of the solution matrix. It's pretty easy to obtain these, but the hard part is to solve for x. Once you'll get it, you will apply the solution to the vector b.<n><n># Solution<n>- **We need to make sure we have all the values (at least the values we need to know)**. So, in order to go ahead and start the solution, create an empty vector p.<n>- Next, we compute p as the result of the multiplication (element-wise) of v and q. This can be done using the `v.dot(q)` method.<n>- The matrix we want is the solution to the A X b = 0 (it's a linear system), so in order to get it, we need to multiply it with b.<n>- Finally, we apply our solution to b, and get `a = qvec @ b`.<n>

This program uses a "while" loop with an "else" statement to make sure the user does not quit the program prematurely and so you will always see the correct answer regardless whether the user gives you the correct answer or not.<n><n>-In your program, you must create two boolean values "IsValid" and "isValid", and you must check if the answer the user gives is valid. <n>-If the answer the user gives does not meet the conditions given by the user (eg: a + b == 5 ), then  your "isValid" variable must be `True`. Otherwise, it must be `False`. You must use the same if/else statement to check for your other conditions given by the user.<n>-When you create your "if/else" statements within your "while" loop, do not break the "loop." Your user should be prompted (and re-prompted) as they need to be in order to make sure you see a correct answer.  The only time you can  break a "while" loop is if your "while" loop is an infinite loop. <n>-The only other thing we should mention is that within the "while" loop, you must use the user feedback you get after the prompt and create another Boolean variable to indicate whether the user got it right.

Using the difference(number of dobermans-number of Schnauzrs) and the number we get, we can determine it is a multiple of 10. Since the number we get is a multiple of 5, that number must be 5.<n>2. Since the number was a multiple of 5 that we must have 40 more, which must be the number of schnauzers.<n>3. Since the number is a multiple of 3, there must be 16 less dogs. For the number of dogs, we will be subtraction 16 from the 40.<n><n><n><n>#### Notes<n>Care must be taken when dealing with nested and parent relationships within a collection.

A number divisible by n means that it can be evenly split by the number n. So when a number is divisible by a given number n, there is no remainder. In this part, we are going to use the Euclidean algorithm to see if this statement is true or false.<n>Let us examine a few divisible numbers first. For example, is 31 divisible by 2? Yes, we have 31 divided by 2=15.75. 15.75 when divided by 2 has no remainder. There is no remainder, so the divisibility by 2 check succeeds. Is 32 divisible by 3? Yes, it is. Is 41 divisible by 5? Yes, it has a remainder of 1. So this statement is true.<n><n>But 31 is not divisible by 7, because the remainder obtained when the division is done is not 0 but 2. So the statement is false for n=7. Is 50 is divisible by 6? This is a bit tricky, since when we do 50 divided by 6, we end up with two remainders: 1 remainder  and 9 remainder . But if we consider

What are the various types of variables supported in C?<n><n>Ans:   There are three kinds of variables in C.<n><n>1. *Primitive* variables which are defined by the compiler automatically as in int, char etc.<n>2. *Declarated* variables which are defined manually are in C.<n>3. *Register variables* which are very fast variables. The variables which are located in the computer's memory in such a way when the compiler finds it is most convenient to use it then only it considers it is called register.<n><n><n><n># Q2. How does the compiler convert a source code program into machine instructions?<n><n>Ans:-<n><n>The compiler basically converts all the tokens and syntax into C language statements (like assignment statements, if-else statements and so on into C statements which can be easily executed by the processor. The processor executes the C statements and the output is displayed on the terminal. The whole process is called compilation.<n><n><n><n><n>#  Q3. What are operators in C?<n><n><n><n>- *A computer cannot execute any program directly. It has to take help of an interpreter.*<n>- To execute the program written in any language like C, we need to write a program in another language called an Interpreter.<n> <n># Q4. Why is it called a compiler?<n><n>Ans :-<n>* The program is compiled when it is processed by the compiler and is converted into machine language.<n>*The program is called source code or high level language.<n><n># Q5. How are data type and data-item are related to one another?<n><n>Ans : -<n>* Data type is a classification to which all variables are assigned (i.e. integer, float, char, double)<n><n>* Data items are the basic units to which any variable is assigned and can have value. For example int is a data type and ‘4’ is a data item.<n><n>

Choices:  A: school B: populated area C: military base D: opera E: church<n>Output:		theater is in populated area<n>### My Approach:<n>####  First, we need to figure out what the theater is.<n>####  Let say, we have theater = c, opera = b, school = a, military base = d, church = e.<n>####  Let x = 53<n>####  If we take theater = c, the equation would be like this:<n>53 - c = x - b where x is the numbers of theater.<n><n>####  Now, we have solved the first equation. The next step is that we have to put a-value of equal to (3) so the second variable c could be equal to b. At this step, we want the values to be:<n>6 - 3 = x - b<n>We can choose 6 = c and b = 9; in this way, when we substitute x = 14 to the original equation, we can get 14 - 33 = 9 - 9 where x = 9.<n><n>1. If the theater is on church, the number of church would be 33 but we have to compare c with -53<n>2. If the theater on military base, the number of military base would be 39 or 37 but the number of theater is c which must be less than -53<n>3. If the theater in school, the number of school would be 28<n>4. If the theater = opera, we need to set number of opera = 33 and x = -53

The shipping company charges a rate of $8 per pound.  How much does a casserole weigh?\nOutput:The first step is to figure out what percentage of the total cost of the casserole goes to shipping.  19%/100=.19.  With that information we can state that 19% of the cost goes to shipping.  The total cost of the casseroles is $5.92.  Since 19% goes to shipping, the remaining cost is $4.73.  We then need to figure out what fraction of $4.73 goes to shipping. This is what we know:  The total cost of shipping = 4.73 - 8*19= <<4.73-8*19= 6.08>>6.08  The shipping charge = 4.72 - 8*10 = <<4.72-8*10=6.1>>6.1  We are left with a total of 6.1-6.08 = <<6.1-68 =.02>>.02 in shipping so the weight can be calculated as.02/6.1=<<.02/6.8=.0031>>.0031.\nSo the final step is to convert.0031 to pounds, which is.0031/16=<<.0031/31=.01>>.01", "answer": "C: victorian house"}

How many calories does that person eat in a day?\nOutput:\nYou can do this in a bunch of different ways. The easiest (and least useful) would be to do the whole problem in your head and estimate the calorie counts. To just be on the safe side we know that in the worst case the person eats 30 doughnuts in the day so 3*.44 = 1.32 *1000 * 3 = 3960 calories per day. But the probability of you eating 30 doughnut is ridiculously high, like a 99.999% chance, which means that your real average should (mathematically) be closer to 3*.34 * 3 = 10.24 calories per every bite. So the probability that you eat too much is that you overestimate. And the probability that you make your choice the right way is that you estimate this prob (the probability of your estimate).\n\n\n\nInput:A restaurant is selling 3 pieces of fish for the price of one piece of fish less than it sells one piece of fish for.

You have a truck that holds 4-gallon jugs of grape juice.  Given that there are 12 jugs of grapejuice in each load and that you can only carry 8 at one time, how many trips will you have to make in order to take care of the entire load?\nOutput: Let\u2019s first calculate how much is held in each load by dividing 12/4 or 12/4 = <<12/4=3>>3 jugs.\nThen, let\u2019s calculate how many loads you can physically fit into your truck at one time.  We can do that by taking into consideration the amount of space the jugs take up by multiplying that by 12.\nSo 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>1 times your truck can store jugs\nNow that we know we should make 4 trips so we can bring home entire loads, we need to get rid of those other 4 empty jugs after every trip.  We can do this by carrying 1 jug for every 4 more than we can store in our truck.\nSo if there is a remaining 4 we can put in our truck.  We will need to travel 4 extra times to account for the empty jugs.

The pet barked for 17 seconds on the fifth floor.  How many times did his pet bark on the third floor?\nOutput: The pet barked the following:\n1st floor: bark x 2 = <<1st floor: bak x 2=>>Barks\n3rd floor: bark x?? = <<3d floor: bark x??=>>?\n5th floor: bark x17 = <<5th floor: bak x17=>>?\nThe pet barked the maximum amount of times on the 3rd floor. If we assume <<assume>>the pet barked 1 on the 3rd and not 2, then we should have enough information to solve for the value of x: 3rd floor: bak x?? = 1 <<3d floor: Bak x??? =?1 >>This implies that bark = 1/??.\nNow taking one of the given values for the times the pet barked we can solve for x: 3rd: bark x3 = <<3rd: 3 barks =?>>1/3 = 1/3\n2nd x2 = <<2d x2 = 2>>2/2 = 1\n4th floor: bark 8x2 17= <<4th floor: bak 8x2=17>>17/17 = x/12\nThus for each floor, the pet barks x times, and from this we can compute x for each floor:\n1st floor bark x2 = <<1st", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

So for taxes we subtract taxes, and since the 10 dollar price is $10+tax the tax we are talking about is the amount the is already in the price.. So the tax is 400 \u2013 (10+tax) = $<<400-10-tax>>336.67\nSo the final Answer (The price, after taking tax out for the more expensive book) is $336.66\n\nInput:A movie theater ticket costs $12.50 ($12.50 + tax) + rental fee.

Since she walks at least 1 second per floor, she walks at least an additional 7 seconds.\nThe walk to and from the elevators combined will take at least 19 seconds.  Assuming she takes the elevator, it will take 22 seconds to cross all 25 floors from elevator to elevator.  Assuming she walks, it will take 7 + 19 = <<7+19=26>>26 seconds.\nBecause she takes an elevator or a 22 second walk and this can\u2019t be longer than that, the total time to walk home is the shortest total time.\n\nInput: How many inches in 24 feet?\nOutput: <<24*12=288>>288 in\nSo the final answer should be 288\n\nInput:What is the length of a school bus?\nOutput:<<21*12=252>>252 feet\nSo the final answer to this question is 252\n\nInput : What is the length of a truck?\nOutput:<<18*12=216>>216 feet\nSo the final length is 216 feet\n\nInput :What is the length of an ambulance?\nOutput:<<30*12=360>>360 feet\nSo the final number to get is 360\n\nInput: What is the length of an airplane?\nOutput:<<88*12=1056>>1056 feet\nSo the answer is 1056", "answer": "C: drug store"}

It shows that if the gas was sold at 4 cents per gallon, $340 would be earned in sales revenue. If the gas was sold at the rate of $2.50 per gallon, the sales revenue would be $710. The clerk says that the gas was sold at a revenue of 93 cents per gallon.  What is the rate at which the gas was sold?\nOutput:  Gas was sold at $4 + $2.50  So 4+2.5 = 6\nSo it was sold at (2.5+4)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5\nSo  Rate = (2.5+2)*((4.5/3)*pi) / (4.5*3)/pi = (6.5*3*pi) / (52*pi) = 65pi*345 = 2202\nSo the final rate is 2202cents\n\nInput: A 52.3 gal tank is filled with water when a water hose is turned on, but the tank needs more water to refill to its original level of when it was initially filled.

Solve for h and k: h=-(r2+2 r d+d2)/(2 r d)\nk= (-(2 r d \u2013 r2)/d)/(r2-r d+d2)\nHow do we know that our formula is valid? We can start with the equation for a point, where a is the position of the point on the Cartesian graph and the coordinate system is X axis, Y axis, and Radius axis. x+y=r Then if you consider an arbitrary point at position (x,y)= A, you can solve for x and y: Solve for x-> (-b+-sqrt(b2-4ac))/2a (2(a+b)\u00b2-4a\u00b2c)=-b\u00b2+4a\u00b2c\nYou can plug in the numbers for (a,b,c) (x,y,r)= (-6,14,12) and a=-6, b=14, c=12. Solve for x-> -3/4 Solve for y -> 6\nNow if you replace the letters with the correct variable, you can get the same answer from your formula for the center coordinates.\nSo it will be (-18-sqrt(-432))/(36) k= (-31/4, -26/4, 12)/2(-18-sqrt(-984))/(24)\nSo the final answer would be k= (0,1,2)\n\nInput: A farmer planted 12 acres of pumpkins that he intended to harvest to make pumpkin pies.

After seating all guests, 22 are left to sit at the side tables (22 is not a multiple, so it must remain). 12 guests cannot fit at the head table (12 is a multiple). How many guests can't fit at the head table?\nOutput:The head table has 60 guests and 22 of these cannot fit at the head.\nThe remaining guests are randomly assigned and there are 22 left to sit at the same head table so their total is even because they are not multiples.  This means we can evenly split the remaining 60 guests for there will be twice as many as the head table has and twice as many of them will be at the head table.\n12 guests could still be used for the head table but with multiple seating we have left 28 guests which would not fit.

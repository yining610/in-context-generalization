What were the odds that it was raining on Thursday' time the game started.\nOutput: The odds that it was rainnig on Thursday' game time, is the odds that it is raining, minus the odds that there was going to at least a tad and minus the odds that it wasn't going to rain. \nSince there was going to be a tad of rain, then there there is a 40% odds that it was going to rain.  And the odds were 50% that it wasn't raining.  So there is a 60% odds that there wasn't raining at the game time.  The odds of it rainning, then is 1- (0.4 * 0.6) = <<1-((.40)(.60))>> = 0.6775 is 67.75%\nSo there would be a 67.7% possibility that it was raining at the game.\nSo the final odds is 67/12 = <<67/12=55.9237~55.9>>55.9222\n\nInput:\"We will get a total of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14\"\nOutput:1*3+2*3+3*3+4*3+5*3+6*3+7*3+8*3+9*3+10*3+11*3+12*2*3+13*2*", "answer": "B: main"}

If these two are answered then the whole question has an answer.\nThe snake is 12 times longer then the tail, and the tail is 12 times larger then the new snake.\nSince the tail is larger than the snake, it is larger than the snakey.\nThe snakey and the tail together are larger than the new snake by a combined factor 13, i.e. larger than 13 times the new snake length.\n(Together: 12 + 6 = <<12+6=18>>18\n(One snake- tail : 12 + 12 = 12 * 12 <<12*12=144>>144\n(One snake -  new snake: 13)(13))\n(Tail+ Snakey) - new snake  = 144 - 12 = <<144-12=132>>132\nThus, the snake by itself is 13.\nSince the tail and the snake are together, the snake is 2*13= <<2*13=26>>26 times larger than the new snakey.\nSo, the answer to the last question is 13 + 26= <<13+26=39>>39,\nbut again, the tail and the snakey together is", "answer": "C: being found out"}

At 1.50 = <<1.5=1.5>>1.5 per pound, you can buy 15 pounds. You can buy  15 pounds of apples for $$112.50 = <1.5*15>$112.5$$ or less.   At 2.80 = << = 2.80>2.8>>2.8 per pound, you get one pound. In other words, you can buy one apple for  y = 2.8 dollars. This cost 2.8 dollars plus tax, if any.  So here is how you spend 50 dollars:  If you buy  112.5 pounds of apples, you will have 112.5 - 20.50 = <<$=50>>50 dollars left.  That is: 50  / 50 = <<1/1>>1 dollars for each apple. Therefore, for the tomato, you have 15 pounds left:  50 / 35 = <<1/15>>1  dollars per pounds.  Therefore, for five apples, you now have  five * 5 = <<1/5>>1  dollars left.  If you buy three tomatoes for $26 you will have three $10 left.  (If you are 36 dollars, you still have money left over and will not buy", "answer": "A: headache"}

{"idx": 102, "text": "The correct answer is 8+9=<<8+9=17>>17\n\nInput: 11 or 14 is called a composite number. Why?  Composite numbers are not prime.\nOutput: Every number can be factorized to its prime factors. Factorization:\nIf your number has no prime factors then your number is prime.\nIf your number has prime factors, then your number is a composite number.\n\n11 and 14 are both factorized as 1 x 11 or 2 x 6.  Therefore, 11 and 1 are both composite numbers.\n\n11 = 1 x 10 + 1\n\n14 = 2 x 7 + 1\n\nIn both cases, the first number indicates a part and the other number indicates a remainder.\nThe second number is the least common multiple of the first number and the remainder.\n\nThe only way to write 11 as a 1 x 1+1 is using the LCM of 11 and 2.\n\nThe only difference in the difference between 11 and 4 and the difference between 14 and 3: you can remove the remainder in the numerator 11 and leave the remainder 1 in the denominator.  In the denominator, you cannot remove the remainder 4 from the numerator.\n\nSo in conclusion, 11 is a composite number.   \nWhy? 14 is a composite number.  Because 2 and 7 are prime, 7 and 7 are prime.  Therefore, 2 x 7 is a prime factorization of the composite number 14.\nSo the final solution is 11 and \n14 are composite numbers.\n\nInput: Is there a difference between the amount of salt in the ocean and mountain fresh water?\nOutput:  The difference between the amount of fresh water and salt water in an ocean is enormous.\n\nThe amount of salt in the oceans is over billion times larger than the amount in lakes or rivers that are classified as\nfresh water.\n\nThe density of salt water (about 1.026 grams/cubic centimeter) is greater than that of fresh water\n(about 1.00).

It was on display at a tank with a blue background and it used to live in a tank at sea. Seahorses can jump quite a bit and they're the fastest aquatic mammal.  They're also an endangered species!  Seahorses are quite popular among young children because many people find them funny when they hear their funny names like \"Dick Toup\" and \"Pig Nose\" and \"Long Snout\".  A single seahorse must eat about 12 small clams per day.  Seahorses can camouflage from blue backgrounds and eat by sticking their snouts into the sand. They're able to have kids and they give birth to them by depositing the kids into a pouch on their stomachs. They are able to detect dangerous predators with the help of a special organ called an \"amphistigma\".  People commonly call seahorses \"fish\", but they are actually considered to be mammals.\nOutput:Seahorses are able to jump when they are swimming at a depth of several kilometers below sea level.  They are among the fastest aquatic animals because they swim quite well despite having fins so small that they almost look like nonexistent.\nThey cannot survive without a pouch because the food they eat requires water to be passed in to the stomach.

The village is on a hill and there are very few roads, so residents only visit town every week.  Food costs $2 to transport down the hill and $4 to transport back up.  How much food do residents typically buy at the market on Thursdays?\nOutput:If residents were to go twice a week, the average cost of each trip = (2000 / 2 weeks) / 2 = <<2,000/2 weeks/2>>$1000\nThe total cost per Thursday = 1000 * 2 = $<<2,000*2>>2,000\nThe average cost on the way back = (200 * 20 / 2) / 2 = 50 * 2 =<<200*20/2>>$50\nThe cost per Thursday for going to the market = 1,000 - 50 = <<2,0*/2>>$1,000\nSo the final answer would be $1,000.\n\nInput:Mary, who is a painter, bought 9 colors of acrylic paint and 12 colors of oil paint for her art class project.

Since the film made over a billion dollars world wide, this means he is a world wide success.  The film made over 15 billion dollars because if you take the movie\u2019s first 4 weeks earned and then multiply the sum by 4 you get the value 15+4+9.8*4=<<15+4+37.2*4=754>>754.5 million.  If it made over a billion dollars, it makes sense that his film would gross over a million dollars a week.

Since each cm\u00b3 of the wood is 10 cubed, we can say 100/ 10= <<100/10=100>>100 to equal each cm of the door is made of 100 cm\u00b3. We need to take that 100/15= <<100 over by 15=6.66 to equal each cm of how high the door is made of (in cm). Since the door is made of cm\u00b3 and the door height is cm, door height/ doorkm\u00b3= <<height/cm\u00b3=666.6666667>>666.67\nSo, we need 667 cm of the door or 6 meters and 67centimeter (cm). So since the door is 400 cm\u00b3, we need  0.2 cm\u00b3 of each cm of the door. So door height = door height/ door cm\u00b3= <<20x100/400=200>>200. So, the height is 2m and 20cm.

How much will 25 dollars cost you exactly?\nOutput: Let k be the number of dollars you spend.\nIf you buy food less than $15.00, then k% = <<100-15>>100 - 15, < $15, but > $10.00 => k% = 15% * 10 = 15\nIf you buy food between $15 and $30, k% = 20%. So $15 * 1.2 = <<15*1.2=18>>18\nIf you buy food more than $30, k = $30 30 * 30 = 900\nIn total, your cost is k * percentage_cost, so ((25 dollars) * (15%)) = 18\nSo the final answer should be 18\n\nInput: At what percent of the cost of a car must its value be below $10,000 for it to not be worth it to insure?\nOutput: At what percent do you earn 100% money?\nIf you spend less than $10,0\nAt a percent of:\n10,001.000 -> 10 (100%)\nThe final answer should be 50%\n\nInput: A 8 year old needs a snack before the dance recital.

How many peanuts will you have left in the end if you can eat one pea nut at a time?\nOutput: If you eat one peanut, you will have 91 left because you ate one and the bear ate 1.\nIf you eat two peanuts, you will have 89 because you ate two and the bear ate one.\nSo you can eat at most two peanuts at a time and you will have 90 minus those you eat, which is 87-1+1+2 = 87 peanuts.  In total, you will have 1+2=3 peanuts and the bear will have (87-2) - 3 = (87-2)-3 = (87*96)=8367 peanuts.\nSo the final answers are 90 and 8367\n\n#### Instruction \n\nYou have to solve them with pysical operations and calculations not with programing language, use google or calculator to check your solutions.\n\n### Part3\n\n#### Instruction\n\nYou should have an understanding of arrays and loops in Python to complete this part of the code.

{"idx": 436, "text": "Answer B. Stress can lead to heart attacks and it must be treated immediately. \n\nInput:During the early days of video games, they were created on mainframe computers before moving to more compact formats for home use.  With the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, many of the video game companies that existed at the time found themselves forced to rethink their previous business model.  For instance, the video game company Atari, which had created about 50% of the video games in the market in 1983, now had competition.  In 1984, Atari lost 250 million dollars of equity due mostly to the creation of new video game systems.  Atari, which sold thousands of video games during the late 1970s and early 1980s, soon found itself struggling to stay afloat.  The video games Atari created lost their market to companies like Nintendo, as well as Sega, a video-game-maker headquartered in Japan. Atari went bankrupt in 1984.\nOutput:In the early 1984 the Nintendo Entertainment System(NES) was released. The NES gave the home video gaming industry an innovation they urgently needed to get the industry away from Atari\u2019s 8-bit style of gaming, which had no innovation. Since the Nintendo video games had new innovations they became very profitable. This shift was due to Nintendo\u2019s new strategy of developing their own hardware and software to attract both the casual gamer and the hardcore gamer. Another reason the company had successes was that because they released game consoles that appealed to different types of games. That is to say, there were game consoles that were cheap and appealed to children, but there were also more expensive game consoles that appeals to older people.\n\nInput:The Great Depression and the Crash of 1929 impacted nearly every aspect of modern American life.  The unemployment rate soared, food production declined, homeownership was threatened, and public utilities became unstable. During the height of the Great Depression, 25% of the American workforce was unemployed and millions of families had their lives uprooted by the economic downturn.\nOutput", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

How many bananas did her brother get if there was 6 apples, 4 pears and 8 oranges left?\nOutput: Samantha aste 1/8 of pasta;\nher brother's part is 1/4 of her part.\nIt means brother's part is half of her part.\nIf bro is half of Sam's part, means bro's part is half(1/2) of her part(1/8) therefore brother's part is  1/16\nBrother's part : Sam's part is 7/16\nBro's part from apples : 7/16 * 2 =  9/16\nBro left apples : 9/16 - 5/6 * 6 = 3/16.\n\nSince, total bananas left : 8-4 = 4;\nBrother gets : 3/16 - 1/3, remaining one apple for Bro's part\nBrother's total bananas : 3/12 apples. \nSo the final answer: brother ate 3/12 - 9/1", "answer": "C: san francisco"}

In the first jug, water flows in as $x$ per second and water flows out at $100/x$ per second. In the second jug, water flows into it at $y$ per second and water leaves at $200/y$ per second. The jug can be used to fill up two other jugs. How fast should the water flow into the two new jugs to fill them both up full in $2$ seconds?\nOutput: Let\\'s begin with the first jug formula:  $x=100/x-200/y=1250/y$  If x is flowing into the jug at $1250$ per second, then at $1251$ per second it will fill the new jug, $1252$ per second it will empty the first jug, $1262$ it will fill the second jug... and so on.  So the flow rate of the water is at least $2500$.  Let\\'s now calculate what is flowing out:  $x-1250*y$.  So the minimum flow rate in here is $$1250-x*y>.0>1250-1251*y>1250>1251-y>2500>x>1250$$  So at the least, we are setting $x$ to $1250$.

Thus, equation is (C/formula-C/original)=(C/formula)-((C/original))+1\nAnd, ((C/original))=(C/formula) because the same thing happened to formula when it was used to make new cola.\nSubstituting all these expressions and simplifying the equation, we get: 1-((C-1)/formula) or 1 - C/formula.\nSo the final formula is 1 - C/Formula which is the same as original formula because you subtract Coke/Original from C/Formula to get the original formula.\nSo the final is C/Formula - Coke/Original\n\nInput:After the original formula was discontinued and replaced, how many ounces of formula where there to 7.5 ounces of coke in each can?

If all the letters in the restaurant\u2019s name cost $10, how many letters would they need in order for the sign to cost $180?\nOutput:  Answer is C  I found that 180-10*4 = <<180-40=140>>140 dollars would be the amount needed for a C. So, the restaurant\u2019s name is C.\nHere is my logic for the A: 180-30*4=<<180-120=60>>60 dollars would be the cost for an A. The A costs more because of the extra large A in the middle, it costs only $3/letter for each of the 4 smaller A's, and $9 for the large one.  My logic for B: 180 - 5*4 = <<140>>10 I got 140, because 4 B's cost $20, and the extra cost is $5.  My logic for D (D-4=C)  So my logic for E: 180 + 4 = <<181>>181, as 4E costs $5, but there is an extra $.50, for the dot, which is $5.50, because there is an extra $0.50 for the dot on the E.\n\n[Solution (C)]\n\n```python\nprint(180-140)\n```\n\nInput: There is a total of $450 in bills for groceries.

The total number (60) must have been divisible by 11/3, which is 10 (round to the nearest whole number).\nSince 10/3 = 3, 60 must have been divisible using 3rd grade math. 3rd grade math is the foundation for 4th grade math.\nSince 10 is a round number, 60 must be divisible by 10.  However, 59 and 61 are both divisible by 1, 2, 5, and 10 but the number 60 is not.\nSince 11/3 is 10, 11 must be a multiple of 10 because you can divide all of the non-prime factors by 10 without changing the remainder.\nThe only prime factors are 1, 5, 7, and 11.\n11 does not include any prime factor other than 2 (it includes 2x3)\n11 cannot be divisible by 5 because it's the only prime factor larger than 2.\nSo the number that is divisible by 5 and 11 is 55.\n55/5 = 11 which is divisible by 1.\n\n55/3 = <<25=55>>55\n\nTherefore, 60 has to be divisible by 25.\n60 divided by 25 = <<60/25=", "answer": "E: south pacific ocean"}

You have 2 green, 3 blue and 1 purple hat in your bag. If you pick a hat of a certain color, you will win a prize. You must pick a hat of the same color as the hat of the team that wins that game. Choose the answer that has no mistakes.\n### Explanations:\nThe problem consists of multiple clauses separated by commas. A correct interpretation should consider all clauses.\n\nIt requires to guess in which section you make an erroneous evaluation.\nI think that the question should be interpreted as\n\"Is _the_ bag green or blue or purple or a different color?\".\n\nIn addition, the \"a certain color\" in the question suggests different colors in the hat set (2, 3, and 1).\n\nIf the first hat of the blue team wins, we will need an even number of hats to pick to be able to guess the color of the hat of the blue team correctly.\nIf the first hat is green and the second is blue, then no further evaluation is required for blue team.\nSo the problem is:\nP(first hat of team that wins is green)=2/5\nP(second hat of team that wins differs from the first hat)=2/5 * 2/3\nP(first hat and second hat of team that won match)=2/5 *1/3\nP(at least one hat from the first team is green)=1/3\nSo the answer must be at least green\n\nInput: It's Wednesday.

For example, consider the numbers in the following list.\n[[1, 29],[1, 3],[1, 4],[1, 10],[1, 30],[1, 9],[2, 2],[2, 1]], \nwhich has six elements. Suppose we have defined two sublists, [[1, 2],[1, 3]], and [[2, 3]], so that, for each pair of comparison numbers p and q, we can write (a, b) for the (p, q) pair, and (x, y) for a specific element of the lists. Then our comparison subproblem is to find all elements for which (a, b) and for all (x, y). In this example, there is only one possible pair for which (a, B) and (a, c) is possible, because a = 1. This means that both (u, 1) and (3, 6) work. Therefore our final answer is 2.\n\nInput: What is the name of the famous English playwright and poet, William Shakespeare?

One was as beautiful as the sun and the other was as beautiful as the moon.  Because he loved them with all his heart, he wanted to give them the best gifts he could.  So, he decided to buy a small car from one of the best car manufacturers on earth.  His choice was between a beautiful but expensive sports car and a cheap, reliable car.  He was torn on what to buy for them, especially because his daughters were complete opposites.  The older sister was all out to get a car with the best brand and would consider nothing else.  She was a beautiful soul, but she could be selfish at times too.  The younger sister, on the other hand, was more practical and preferred the economy car, even if it was less appealing.  She did not care about looks since she was not so concerned with fashion.  Since the car manufacturer has the right to choose on which car they want to produce, he decided to choose the more expensive sports car and the less expensive car.  And so he bought two identical cars from two different manufacturers.\n\nChoices:\nA. Who did he buy them for? (Choose the option that is not a daughter.).A B.

This means there are 2424 trees in this group of trees. If the first tree has 92 ft between the next tree and it, what's the total number of feet between the first tree and the closest tree?\nOutput: Let\u2019s call the first tree 1 and the closest tree 2. This means the closest tree 2 is 91 ft away. If we have x, the number of trees between the first tree and tree 2, then we have to figure out 2 + x is 92. We add 2 to our x variable so that x + 2 = <<2+x=92>>92. Now we just need x and we add x to both sides so we can get x. x = <<2x+2=92>>9 x = <<9+2=11>>11 x = <<11/2=5.5>>5.5 because that\u2019s how much we cut the 11 down to the even number to make it a multiple of 2.

{"idx": 623, "text": "Answer: A-Lizards need heat lamps\nSolution: A lizard uses its body surface to regulate its body temperature. If the surface is covered with leaves, desert sand, snow or any other insulating material, the lizard is unable to regulate its body temperatures and will die. Since the lizard needs the sun's heat, if you shade the sun from a lizard, he will die. A lizard's skin temperature is usually 35 to 40 degrees above ambient temperature because it is covered with scales that are transparent and very good at absorbing and reflecting sunlight. The color of the scales is often determined by the climate and background.\n\n\nThe sun's out, so lizards should be on the move. But how? Choices: A. Basking B. Sunbathing C. Stretching D. Playing E. Dusting\nOutput:Answer: B-Sunbathing\nSolution: A sunlit spot is very attractive, but don't be fooled. Basking in the sun for hours at a time can be dangerous, so lizards have to pick and choose their spots carefully. One method to remain safe involves lizards choosing a spot with strong solar exposure but limited direct contact. After selecting the perfect spot, they lie on the ground, spread out their bodies, and remain motionless until they absorb enough heat to warm up their blood.\n\nAfter a long sunny day, it's time to get clean. What does your lizard look like now? Choices: A: Very shiny B: Dirty C: Sleepy D: Wet\nOutput:Answer: C-Sleepy\nSolution: The lizards have spent all day on their skin so they're tired. By the end of the day, lizards often look more like wet puddles than wild animals, especially after their long bath in the sun. After lounging in the sun, lizards lose a lot of moisture and sometimes must drink a little water after they sleep.", "answer": "E: rocks"}

Therefore, the answer to the question is most likely either D or E.\nChoices: Option A, B and C are all possible types of protests.

The question is ambiguously worded to imply that you might be looking for the length (or distance covered) between the two points in time, or the time difference between the two points in space, but the question specifically says \"to finish the race\".

Afterwards, I realized that I had walked in a circle.

Each cloud must have been a distance of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 steps, and thus each must have taken up a quarter of one circle. So there must have been 4 circles in the clouds (1/4 of 4 circles). The steps from me to the clouds must have been the same as the steps from the clouds to me, 4. Adding 1/4 circles to 4 of the steps from myself to the clouds will make 4 1/4 circles. This means that I made 4 1/2 circles. Now, each circle needs to have the circumference of 2 x 3.14 = <<2*3,14=6,26>>6,26 centimeters. Adding 1/2 cirumference of 6 26/100 centimeters in total, there must have been a distance between 2 x 6 26 x 0,1 = 2 6 26 centimeters between me and each circle.

If they ate three slices each and there were 14 people at the party, how many slices were leftover?\nOutput: There was 176 slices left over\nThis problem can be restated as slices = [[total slices] x [people at the party]]= [[14 x 14] x [people at party]]= [[196] x [people at part]]=196 / [[14 x 3]]= [[1986] x [people that ate slices]]= [total slices left over]= 196 / [[3 x 14]]= [[62] x [people that didn't eat slices]]=Total slices left over= [[62] + [[176] x [people ate slices]]]\n\nIn this scenario, [[62] + 176] is the number of total people that ate a slice of pizza but not all did. Thus you would do [[62] + [176/3]] which would equal [[62] +[[58,58,58] x [people that were at the] party]\n\nThe [[58]] would be the average number of slices per person. This is because you need to find the average number of slicer per person after a round down of all 3 rounds of [[58] + [[58] - [[58]]]\n\nThe answer is [[58] + [173]].", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

For this she must have a right angle.\nSo, she will have to draw two right angles to complete her desired size.\nRight angles are 90 degrees and since 9 \u00d7 25 = <<9*25=225>>225\nRight angles add up to 1190, so she needs the half of the right angle (or less than) to form her 90 degrees.\nThis way when her brother draws the two 45 degree angles, she can place them with her drawing to achieve her goal.\nSo the final answers are 225 and 225 again.\n\nInput: A large factory was paying 9 workers $20 per hour. They fired everybody and hired three new workers they could hire for $15 per hour. They now pay $225 per hour in total. They were only willing to pay $225 - (3 * $16) = <<225-3*16=22>>22 per hour for the $16 they save by firing people. So they now hired two of the three new workers. For each worker hired, they are saving $16. They can hire their third new worker with the savings from their three remaining workers: <<225-16-16-12-8-4=22>>2.

They held a vote to decide which kind of car they wanted. They voted 3 times as many people chose a small, 2-5 person sedan versus 2 times as many voted for a 100 seat bus. The 25 person sedan won because 1/12 of the polled voters chose the car.  After the vote, 60 people wanted to buy a car to go to work.  How many cars did each type of car get?\nOutput: Let's look at the question 2 times as many in column 2, in column 3. 3 times as many in column4, in column 5.  5 times as many in column6.  Let's take the 60 people into consideration as well.  We found that 2 times as many have chosen a car. Since 1/12 people voted, 13 people voted for the minivan.  It is true that 1 out 2 voted for minivan or bus.  To check, let's calculate, 60 divided by 9 = <<60/9=60>>66.6 and 60 divided by the minivan, then divide again minivan by 5 = 0.01666667. The minivan wins because each minivan is able to carry 166 people. Each bus is able to carry 0.666666 people.  Therefore, the bus can only carry 100 people per bus.\nSo the final should be minivan\n\nInput: The question is, If in 20 years there were 5,000,000 cows and there is a ratio of 5:1 of cows to humans, how many humans were alive?\nOutput: In the question, let's take 500,00,00 as 5,00,0,0,00\n20 times 500, 500 times 2 = 10,00, 10", "answer": "E: row boat"}

He looked it up and finally found a solution. The only problem was that he didn't know the language very well and he couldn't explain it to his coworker. The coworker asked what the project was about and the man wrote in English: \"It's a game where you have to answer a question in order to progress\". The coworker replied that he didn't understand what he was talking about. The man tried to explain again by saying: \"You come to the computer and it has a question, like: \"Can you jump to the moon\" or something like that. You answer the question and keep going if you answer correctly, if not then you can start over. That's what I said.\" The coworker asks again and he writes: \"What is the question about?\" The man goes and says: \"Well it's about math. Math is pretty complicated, and I don't understand it myself.\" What was the question about?  Choices: A- Is it possible to climb to the moon without a spacecraft. B- Can you jump to the Sun  while it doesn't exist C- Can you jump to a planet that isn't Earth D- Can you jump to Jupiter when Jupiter hasn't formed yet E- Can you jump to Mars while Mars isn't there.\nOutput: Based on the conversations, we know both the question and the answer. The question reads \"Can you jump to Mars when Mars has not formed yet?\"\nThe answer reads: \"Can you jump through the Sun when the Sun has not yet existed?\"\nSince it's the same sentence with different word order, this isn't a direct translation in English, so E must be the correct answer.\nSo the final and only answer is E.\n\nInput: I put a glass plate over the stove so that the dog wouldn't scratch the table.

How many teguments cover the chameleon's face?\nOutput: Each tegument is described in terms of rectangles.  The chame leafon's forearm is described by [a][b].\nThe ratio of the length of the forearam area to the total exposed area is 1/16.\nThe ratio of the width of the fore-arm area to the total exposed areas is 1/4.\nThe forearm area is rectangular, so the formula is: <1/16>. <1/4> = 16/4\nThe forearm ratio is 4:1. To determine the number of segments, divide each by 4 to get 4=1, 2=2, 1=4. There are 4 segments in the forearm.\nThe rectangle that covers the chest is 1/4, so the segment of the area ratio is 1/4=4/1, which is 4 segments.\nThe face has the same ratio for the face.\nThe total of segments is four for the fore-arm area, two for the chest and finally one for the face which is added to the fore", "answer": "D: card game"}

They don't have a great sense of direction but they can find food, and will often make their homes around sources of water. While they can tolerate fairly dry climates, in order to stay healthy, they need a varied diet of different fruits.\nThe four different food sources listed here include:  oranges, bananas, apples, and blueberries. While it's possible they could access the first three on their own, blueberries are often wild and will often grow in an area that's fairly remote.

C: a lynx and D: the dog are both mammals.\nOutput: The dog is a mammal that is not a beast and a beast is also a mammal. A butterfly is a beast and lynx is a beast, but they are not both mammals.  Bee and dog are not both beasts, but both are mammals. They are not both beast and they are not both insects.\nIn the animal set, both dogs and bees are mammals. Beastness has nothing to do with what the set contains, but rather is the relationship between sets within the set. For example: A lynx is a mammal.  A lion is a mammal, so lynx and lion are both in the same set, the set of mammals.  Both the lion and the lynx are beasts because the set of beasts are made up of the same group of animals as the set of mammal. If we remove both the lion and the beast from the group of mammals, we are left with dogs and bees.  So if we ask about the relationship of bee and dog with the set of beasts, the answer would be that both bees and the dog are beasts.  This is because they are in the same set as the beasts.

A positive division by a larger number results in a quotient greater than 1. What is this number?\nOutput:The answer is 1001.\nBecause 1/3 can produce 1 as a remainder, and also, 1000/3 = 333\nNow, 1001/3 = 3\nIf you were to continue, this would result in 2 more digits for the final quotient\nSo, 2 + <<3>>3 = 1002\nNow, 1/3 can get 2 as a remainder, so (<<2>>2)/3 = 4/3, which results in 1 digit more\nSo, 4/3 = 10/3\nNow, 4/3 can result in 4 as a remainder, so 4/3/3 = 12/9, which results in 2 digits more\nSo, 12/9 = 14/7\nYou can't do it anymore because 1/3 can't result in anything as a remainder\nThat's why it's the 14th digit after the decimal point\nSo, 4*14/7 = 56/7, which results in a 6/7 as the final quotient, so 2 and 9/100.\nThat's why the final answer is 9999\n\nInput: What are the sum of the first two digits of the third?

{"idx": 910, "text": "Let X be the opposite of the word foolhardy.\nThere is only one vowel before the second 'i' in foolhardy so we can say that the opposite of foolhardily sounds like a different word.\nWe have an N, L, S and Y after the 'i' in fool hardy. The N could be a silent E, L or R. The S could be a silent T. The Y could be a silent Y or I.\nSo to get the opposite of foolhard, we can think that we have a combination of a letter that sounds like each of these words: eve, elf, es, esi, sly, si, sui, ly, i.\nIn english, 'i' after a vowel changes it's sound. So we know we can end up with 2 different spellings here.\nIf the word is: elf or eve we will have an F before the second 'i'.\nIf the word is elt or si we will have an S before the second 'i':\nelf = 'el' + 'f' = fo\neve = 'e' + 'v' = v\neft = 'e' + '' + 'f' = fa\nelf: foal\neve: ev'ry\neft: eft'\nsi: si' -> sii -> syaa -> shay\nSo the opposite of foolhard sounds like a different word of: fal, elf, foal, ev, foa, fa, sha, sy\nSo the opposite of the word is: thoughtful: thought\nSo the final answer here is thought", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}

To do that I need to know how many total marbles are in the bag (17+5+7+1=26). Since I am being required to select 4 marbles which mean I need to calculate all four of the possibilities: <1*2>\n\n1/26, 2/26, 3/26, and 4/26. For 26 the sum of 1+2+3+4 = 10 and all of these options would be 0/26. (For the first 4 I would need to add 0 to that but I should not account for that now since 0 was not an option in the question)\n\nI then will use binomial probability. So the formula for b2N would be: prob(1/26)prob(2/26)prob...prob(n/26)\nAnd since I am being required to either draw 4 red,", "answer": "C: bound"}

The percentage is the 6 in the bag divided by the 10 in the box, which is 100/100 = <<6/10=1/10=10%>>10%.\nSo the final answer 10%\n\nInput: If Peter was going to eat 4 slices of banana bread for breakfast and he has 7 bananas at home. How many bananas will he eat?\nOutput: So if Peter has 7 bananas, then 7/4 = <<7/4=7/4>>1 1/4 slices of bananas bread will be eaten. So Peter will eat 1 1/4 banana slices out of 4 slices and the remainder number is 3. So Peter will use 3 banana slices for 2 of the 4 slices. Since he has 7, Peter will only be eating 3.

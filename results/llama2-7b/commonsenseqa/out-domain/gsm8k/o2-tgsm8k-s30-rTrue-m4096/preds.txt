A 2-digit number would be positive or zero.  If they are zero or less than 10 they become a 1-digit number and are processed using the standard addition operation.  If they are greater than 10 they are added to each other and the sum of the two 2-digit digits is printed.<n><n>The question is: what if the two inputs are negative numbers.  Is there a way to solve this problem in C++?<n><n>One solution is to just use the standard subtraction process to subtract the two numbers and then just solve that using the regular addition process.  The problem with this solution is that it only works for negative numbers that have two digits.  This is not a good solution.<n><n>Another solution was to just get the numbers added a different way.  You could take the number of digits in the two numbers and use that as the offset in to the original number where you start adding numbers to add the two numbers together.<n><n>So I think this is a great discussion and

Result is greater than number A and smaller than the result of b dividing a by B.  Explain how to get a correct answer<n>Output: Since the two numbers are positive, 5 cannot be further reduced by dividing it the number, 3, or it would produce a negative result.<n>The only other way to reduce the quotient of the two numbers, 5 and 3, is to divide it by the number with the higher powers, so you can use 3.<n><n>Input: 26/5<n>26 divides by 5 is 3  the remainder is 4<n><n>(<n>Output: There are two ways to solve division sentences. One is to multiply the dividend by the divisor. Another way is to subtract the dividend from the divisor a few times. For example, 5/2=<<5/2=1>>1, because 2/5=<<2/5=1>>1/2=<<1/2=1/2>>1/2.<n>5/2=5×2=<<5×2=25>>25.<n>Output: There are a of ways to solve division sentences, but they have four rules in common.  The first rule is, "When two whole numbers are added, or subtracted, multiply the difference by the power of 10 to get the value." For example, 5 + 3 = 3 + 2 and 5 – 3 = 2 – 2.<n>The second rule is, "Increase the power of 11 10 by 1 to get the value for each addition and subtraction, and then multiply

Choices:  A: mediate B: have rest C: stay in bed D: run out of steam E: go to sleep<n>Output:		After running for 5 days in a row, we are exhausted. We think that we only have to recover from exhaustion. However, what we actually need to recover from is dehydration.<n>In a healthy human being, energy is produced from sugar called glucose.<n>While running, lactate is created.<n>And the lactate is the substance that is burned to make energy.<n>Therefore, we have to replenish the reserves of lactate by consuming carbohydrates.<n>At that time, lactic acid is oxidized to produce energy.<n>And then, carbon dioxide is produced from lactic acid while being consumed into lactate.<n>As a result, we do not get depleted of energy and we can produce enough energy required for running.<n>However, in cases where we run for too long and exhaust energy, we actually get dehydrated and collapse first.<n>In other words, exhausting our energy is equivalent to extinguishing water that is on the fire.<n>Therefore, the only way to recover from exhaustion is to drink water.<n>In short, recovery comes with drinking water.

He can make one automobile body for every eight hours of work, which is three times faster than his co-workers. How many automobile bodies will he be able to make in twenty hours?<n>Output: The current pace of the co-workers is one body per <<1 body per 8 hours. One body per 8 hours is equal to 1*8=16 >>16 bodies in 8 hours.<n>If he is 3 times faster than the co-workers, the time he needs to complete one automobile body is <<1 3 times faster than 16 =8 >>8 times the required time for a automobile body made by the co-workers.<n>The additional workers working at 3 times the speed of their co-workers needs to complete one automotive body in <<1 3 times 8 = 24 >>24 times the required time.<n>So the answer is 40 Automotive Bodies.<n><n>Input:If 100 people are asked, how many of them will say that they hate potatoes?<n>Output: The data are given as a percentage of the total number of people asking. So 100 people makes 100%.  The number of people who hate is how percent of 100? That tells you 100 divided by 100 tells you one out a hundred hate it.<n>Then 100/100=<<100/15>>40.<n>And the final answer is 1 out of 40 people who hate potatoes.<n><n>Input:What is the smallest prime number greater than 50?<n>Output

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n>Output:		The correct answer to this multiple choice question is “B”.<n>It may also be that your skin will feel bumpy or even clammy (e.g., wet) due to your skin’s reaction to being pinched.  <n>The best way to determine whether a reaction is occurring is to apply pressure to the affected area of skin for a few seconds, e.g., by pinching with your fingers.  <n>You will sometimes feel itching as a response to being pinched.<n><n>Input: You have some staples, scissors, and paper. How many sheets of paper can you cut with the given supplies?<n>Output: How many sheets can you cut depends on how much paper you want to cut; so, there is no single correct answer, though you can cut at most 5 sheets.<n>If you want to cut only one sheet of paper, using the given supplies, there will be enough space to align one staple, one length of scissors, and one sheet of paper.<n><n>If you want to have enough room to cut multiple sheets of paper, then you should first use your stapler on one sheet of paper.  <n>Then you should cut your stapled sheet into two or more smaller sheets of paper, or even shorter pieces, so that you can align one line of staples, one length of scisisors, and one sheet or shorter piece of paper.  <n>Assuming you want to cut at least one sheet of paper, the number of sheets you can cut, c, satisfies c<=<<c<=4>><=4.<n><n>So we have an upper bound of 4, but how about a lower bound?   <n>The shortest length on two sheets of paper is the distance between their midpoints.<n>The midpoint of one sheet is the center of the sheet—one half of it.  The midpoint of two sheets of paper is just the sum of the two halves of the individual sheet, or 1 + 1 = 2.   <n>Therefore any two small sheets (e.g., smaller than or equal 2) can be safely stapled together.  <n>You are now left with a stack of paper that is approximately 2 inches tall.   <n>But how about three?  We already know from above that 2 is a upper bound of three, so the lower bound would be 3 – 1 = <<3 –

An hour and a half later, a pilot flying a plane from Las Vegas, Nevada sees the first plane on his radar and tries to intercept the flight path of the first plane to stop it from entering U.S. Air Space. He turns his plane around and heads east at the same speed toward Chicago. How long does the pilot from Las Vegas have to stop the first plane before the first plane reaches Las Vegas? Output: The first plane will reach Las Vegas 250miles into the second plane's flight path. <n><n>It will take 250/(250=<<250/(200=0.5>>0.5>>0) and it will take 2 hours to travel 250 miles at 250 miles per hour. Thus, Las Vegas, Nev. will be 1.5 hours into the flight path of the second plane. Since the second plane moves at a speed greater than the first plane, Las Vegas,  Nev, will encounter the second plane before the second plane will reach Las Vegar, Nev. The pilot should intercept the flight path of second plane when it reaches a distance of 1.5 hours or 250 miles, into Las Vegas, Nev to stop the first plane from entering the U.S. Air. So the final answer is 1.5<n><n><n><n><n><n>####<n>

He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n>Output:		The Family room<n><n>The ficus does not look good in a Salon<n><n>It looks okay in the kitchen, but you would need a large one, that would take up too much of that space.<n><n>The tropical forest is too unpredictable as it can lead to a lot of extra cost and responsibility in upkeep.  It requires a lot of watering, fertilizer, and also needs to have a lot of attention and care.  A ficus is an indoor plant, and it is unlikely that it will die in such an environment.<n>The family room is the best environment for a ficus as it is where you want people in your home to be more comfortable with their surroundings.<n><n>To answer this question fully, you need to look into the characteristics of the house as well as the characteristics of the ficus.  You should answer the question by knowing the facts and not by just judging by appearance. The facts about ficus and a family room are as follows:<n><n>Facts about the ficus:<n><n>    Fact 1:<n>        It needs lots of space<n><n>    Fact 2:<n>        It requires lots of attention and care.<n><n>    Fact 3:<n>        It needs a pot that drains well<n><n>    Fact 4:<n>        It cannot live in a small pot for long periods of time.<n><n>Facts about a family room:<n><n>    Fact:<n>        People go to the family room to have comfort.<n><n>    Fact: <n>        The family room is the main room of the house and is the most used room.<n><n>    Fact<n>        The family room allows plenty of space to put other plants as well if desired.<n><n>    Fact    <n>        There is less need for people to take care of the ficus as compared to the other plants.  You don't have to worry about watering the plants everyday or even every other day.<n><n>So the answer should be "Family Room" because the above facts say if you have a family room, you also have everything the ficus needs.<n><n>Input:The ficus does not need much water because it can live happily in an environment with less water.<n><n>You can water the ficus once every other week, although the ficus tree is able to live without any water. In the winter time, your ficus tree does not need a lot of attention. You can leave

Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n>Output:		The answer: C. You never get air exactly from one place. You are born on earth so the air you are born with was breathed by your mother. If you live the rest of your life in your home the air you breathed when you were living there will only have been breathed by the people inside that house. A train station is somewhere that you are likely to stop to rest or go shopping and is usually open to the public so air in there has been breathed by other people. A cupboard would just be full of air that you can breathe when your air runs out. A cricket stadium would be open to the public so, as with a train station, the air inside has been breathed by lots of people but it is possible that the people in the stadium were very young so might not have needed much air. Earth.<n>Choices: A, B, C, D, E<n><n>Explanation:The correct answer is C. I think there could be any of the other answers. A train station, house, cupboard or the earth (the earth is always open to the public).But the air in a house was breathed by the people who were living in it, air in a train station was breathed by people who have stopped there, people who work there and the people living in the train station or nearby. The cupboard only contains the air that the people breathe and the air that they breathe isn't contained to the cupboard, it just goes on blowing out of their mouth in other rooms of the house. Cricket stadium is only breathed by people who go there but only when they have run out of air at home. The air on earth is breathed by most people in the world.<n><n>Input:A bizarre math equation is: x / 0 < 2.<n>Which of the following expressions is a mathematical equivalent of the equation?

Choices:  A: liquidated B: own resources C: branch out D: commit crime E: game over<n>Output:		All choices have a correct answer (but the order doesn't matter). You can try them in any sequence you like.<n>(1) A and B are both incorrect.<n>When a company is bankrupt, the only options are to liquidate the company and sell its assets; or the company uses its own assets to cover all its debts.<n>(2) C is incorrect. It's not enough to branch out.<n>A company can't branch out to new companies without getting more funding or other resources.<n>(3) D is incorrect. A company doesn’t have to make criminals; it can be honest for a living.<n><n>(4) E is incorrect. The game is not over, because the players continue to play until the end of the game. In this case we don't know how the game ends.<n><n>#### [Solution](https://github.com/kun-lin/cody-training/tree/master/instructions)<n>

Choices:  A: jar B: stick to fingers C: beehive D: stick to fingers E: farmer's market<n>Output:		I would choose stick to fingers or A if the apis are the kind that form honey directly on their bodies. The type whereby bees use their bodies for both food and for sticky honey. The bees use their bodies as storage area for food and this is known as beer. This is what you get when your stick your finger into a colony of bees. The choice between A and B is based on which way I plan to process the honey. If I intend to process into combs for resale, or for making wax products, A is the best choice. If I will eat the honey right away or if I plan to pour the honey into jars or other containers for resale, stick to the fingers would be the better choice. Also, B is better than D, because it is more likely to contain raw honey with pollen whereas jar honey and farmer's market honey are processed in different ways.<n><n>Input:You are going to a supermarket to buy 2 eggs. You find 4 choices for eggs available in supermarket:1. Whole egg2. Egg without shell3. Egg without shell4. Whole egg<n>Output: The question is a little tricky. What is the correct answer? It is obvious that choice 4 is a whole egg, and choice 1 is an egg without shell. The choices 2 and 3 are also obvious, because the question says "available in supermarket", which means that choices of an egg either with or without a shell are available in supermarket.<n>Therefore, the correct answer should be 1 and 3 or 3 and 1, but not 4 and 1, because if it is 4 and 1 that would mean your first egg is missing a shell. Therefore, you should choose 2 or 3 over 4 and 1.<n><n>-<n>##Solution<n><n>In the first instruction, we convert $ in terms of %, by multiplying 100% and we get 20.

The man can place $2000/month in the savings account.  After 4 years, how much money will be in his savings account?<n>Output: The rental income is $1800. The mortgage payment is $1200.<n>The $1000 payment that is paid off each month of the mortgage is $120,000 that was paid out.<n>In four years, the first month will have paid off half of the loan. That amount is $6,000.<n>The second month will pay off another $3000. The interest is paid off as money is made available. So after four years, the interest is gone and is no longer paid.<n>These 9000 are placed in the savings account for 4 * 12 months = 48 months or almost four years.<n>The monthly investment in the savings account is $1000 for the first month and $300 thereafter to cover the interest. So the principal is not touched and remains at $6000. So the interest is $400.<n>So 48 months at $400/month gives $19,200.<n>So the total is $19200 plus the $6000 from the mortgage payment = $25,200<n><n>Input: What does a "C" represent in mathematics?

Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n>Output:		A swim is going to get you nowhere: you simply have to keep repeating the task.<n>So answer A is not correct: the answer to swimming is you keep swimming, as the task never ends.<n>Exertion, or exercise, will take up a lot of energy and cause you to tire very quickly, as you tire faster than your heart and lungs can take up energy (oxygen, in this case).<n>The answer C, exertion, is incorrect for this same reason.<n>The correct choice is B, jogging.  The task involves running a fixed total distance, a distance you decide.  Each trip you return home, so the distance traveled does not repeat itself.  The jogger has the same destination at each trip, so with a fixed distance to run each trip, the jogger's goal of increasing the total distance walked is achievable.<n>By contrast, the rock-climber never reaches their destination.  They simply keep going up and down and repeating that process forever.<n>And the answer D, workout, is simply restatement of the problem - the answer is not D, workout, but rather B, jogging.<n>Thus, the correct answer is B, jogging<n>#!/bin/bash<n><n>#This program uses the bash for loop<n>#You do not need to download python 2.7 or virtualenv<n>shopt -s expand_aliases<n>alias'sudo'='sudo -u $USER -H -p "$(whoami)"'<n>export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH<n>echo 'The first 7 days were'<n>echo $(( 190/(7*24) ))<n>echo 'There were'<n>echo $((${11-7}))<n>echo 'days left.

It actually was taken from a play by William Shakespeare called"Merchant of Venice, where one of its main characters agrees to forfeit a pound of his own flesh if another character defaults on a loan.  Of course, the play is fictional and there are no plans to start taking pounds of anyone’s flesh.  (A pound is about 16 ounces.).<n>Output:The original play was an 1598 stage play written by William Shakespeare.<n>It is set in Venice and centers around a deal between a Jewish man, Antonio, and a famous Venetian.<n>Antonio is in need of money to secure his own business and requests a loan from the famous Venetian, for which the latter will receive a pound of Antonio’s flesh if the former doesn’t repay the loan, which the latter does.<n>In the original play, the flesh is to be received by the Venetian in front of the judges in the marketplace, where the other characters of the play, friends of Antonio, are gathered.<n>The phrase to forfeit a flesh is still a common idiom in common vernacular.So the final and the tr<n><n>Input:In Shakespeare’s play, the terms of the loan are unusual, but the fact that William Shakespeare has borrowed from earlier sources is not unusual.<n>It appears the expression is derived from an earlier poem by Thomas Wyatt.

What is the probability that neither suffer negative effects from the drug?<n>Output: The probability of each patient having no adverse effects is given by the factor of 1/(1-0.3), so the probability of a double event of both patients being without adverse effects is simply the product of the individual probabilities: the probability of the first patient not experiencing any side effects is the multiplicative factor of 1/(0.7) and the probability of the second patient NOT experiencing any side effects being the multiplicative factor again of 1/(0,7).<n>Therefore the final answer is 1/(0.3*(1/(0.7))*(1/(0.3)))<n><n>### Problem Set A: Probability<n><n># Include the following libraries in your code.<n>import numpy as np<n>import pandas as pd<n>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<n>from sklearn import svm<n>from sklearn import cluster<n>from sklearn.decomposition import PCA<n>from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis as LDA<n>import statsmodels.api as sm <n>import seaborn<n>from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler as MMS<n>from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer<n>from sklearn.svm import SVC # SVM is short for Support Vector Machine<n>from sklearn import datasets<n># SVC is a supervised learning algorithm. <n>from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression <n># Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algo. which is used for binary classification.<n>from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB<n># GaussianNaiveBayes is another supervised learning algorithm, similar to Logistic<n>classify_patient = datasets['mushroom']<n><n># Splitting up the mushroom dataset for training and testing<n>x_train, x_

If not, then the time between dinner and bed would be longer.<n>Hence, given the dinner is a working dinner,  there are many different possible scenarios for the completion of each section.<n>Based on the 3-courses and no coffee or dessert, we  can reason 30 to 50 minutes for eating time; based on our 75 minute bedtime, with at least 45 minutes of sleep at 10:30pm, and the 45 minute travel time between dinning and bed, 33 minutes or more would have to have eaten; and 45 minutes or at least 2 hours is spent sleeping.<n>Assume we have 33 minutes between dinner and bed to prepare to get to bed.  If dinner is eaten at exactly 45 minutes later at 7:30 we end up going to bed at 8:15pm, 15 minutes later than our deadline.<n><n><n><n>

Then the subjects rated how funny they found the picture on a scale of 1 to 5.  For example, they might rate a picture of a comical wiener dog as a 4 ("funny").  The researchers found a strong correlation between their ratings of the pictures with the number of actual laughs they produced.

I checked out a lot of different manufactures and models. I found that each model had several options. It started raining as I was ready to buy. Which of the following options would be cheapest?<n>Output:The output is one of the choices<n><n>Input:A computer has 16 GB of RAM (Random Access Memory)  RAM is the memory in a computer that temporarily holds data for processor use. The amount of RAM defines whether the computer has adequate memory available for the programs that are running. It does not include the amount of RAM available for running the operating system (which takes much less space on RAM than any application that the computer might run) nor virtual RAM provided by the operating system to facilitate multi-tasking. RAM uses a lot of electricity and produces a lot of heat. High-powered CPUs generate a lot of heat, which makes it hard to cool computers with as little RAM as possible, because the computer's fans have to work harder to move more hot air.<n>Output:The output of 16 is the answer<n><n>Input:At one of our large department stores in the city of Chicago there is one of the best bargains in sports. A new skate board costs $159. If you purchased it on sale you would save $5. Then your cost would be $154. There is a 10% reduction in price for every $300 you purchase. If your total purchase was more than $300, you would save additional 10%. If the total of your purchase was less than $300 you would have to pay an additional 5%. If you buy more than one skate board what will be your total cost?<n>Output: There are two choices and one of them is correct as it says in the options so we need to eliminate one. As 25% off of 250 + 30% off of 230 + 5% off of 185 gives us 140.25 and 140.6 < 140 < 140.75

The student's teacher will not accept a paper that is shorter than 1,200 words or longer than 1,450 words. What is the length of the shortest paper, in words, that the student can submit without being penalized?<n>Output:The length of the shortest acceptable paper, in words, is 1,201.<n>Since a 1,208 word paper is slightly less than 1,250 words, the student must drop two words; thus, the paper's length would be 1,206 words, not 1,207 words, and then the student could subtract one more word, yielding 1,205 words.<n>Since a 450 word paper is less than 1,400 words, the student's paper may not be longer than 1,399 words.<n>And since a 1,451 word paper is just 4 words short of 1,455 words, the student'smay not surpass 1,454 words.<n>So the minimum acceptable length is 1,264 words and the maximum acceptable length is 1454 words. Subtracting these extremes from the maximum allows for an acceptable paper size between 1,204 words and 1,398 words.  So the shortest acceptable paper is 1,210 words long, meaning the word count must be 1,199 words or less.<n>So the final acceptable answer is 1199 words<n><n>Input: A rectangular table, 80 inches wide and 40 inches long, is to be covered with a rectangular sheet of flexible plastic that is 4 inches longer than the table.

The humans only goal is to prevent this.  It's a stalemate.<n>Both programs are left with 12 pieces instead of 19.  However, neither program captures a piece owned by the other player (only one player can own a piece, that piece cannot move, and no pieces can overlap, so 19 pieces cannot be owned by both programs).  Both programs have an infinite number of potential moves and so they are equally strong.  Neither is strong enough to win.<n><n>Input: A function f(x) represents the height, in feet, of various trees.  It is known that for values of x 0 and x 1, the following graph represents f(x).

His company requires its employees to drive a car to work; it does not pay for any employee who drives to work. However, the company pays $7 a day for a rental car and $0.52 a mile for a rental car to be used to go to a job site. Each drive to and from a job site uses the same amount of gas and causes a correspondingly equivalent amount of wear and tear on the rental car. The carpenter decides to use a $15 a day rental car for each day he works. It takes 60 miles to travel each way to a certain Atlanta job site each day. John can work 4 weeks every 2 weeks.

Choices:  A: flower garden B: garden center C: pot D: pot E: formal garden<n>Output:		It makes more sense to put a rosebush in a pot because it protects the roots from being disturbed.<n>If it is in a garden center, it will eventually die from being moved.<n>If in a flower garden, the garden may not be right for it now but will not harm the plant.  And, if not the right place in a flower garden, it can be moved to a pot.<n>If in a pot, it will thrive for a few weeks.  So it does not matter if the pot is in the flower garden or the house.<n>If in a formal garden, it is not being displayed in a proper way.<n>If in a container, there will be a watering hassle but you can buy a big flower pot that can make a formal garden in a way it cannot with all the money you are saving to buy a proper flower garden.<n>So the answer is D because no matter the choice, you would later end up with either a proper rosebush or flower garden.<n><n>Input: Which of the following values is not a rational number? Choices: A: the ratio of the lengths of two sides in a right triangle, B: the square root of a positive number, C: the reciprocal of a fraction, D: the sum of integers, E: an irrational number that produces an infinite decimal representation<n>Output: A is defined as a ratio and there is no such ratio for a right triangle.<n>B is rational because it is the square root of a number, which is a rational number.<n>C is rational because it is defined as the reciprocal of another rational number called a fraction.<n>D is rational because it is a sum of integers.<n>E is irrational because it cannot be expressed in any ratio, infinite or defined.<n>So the choice is B - it is the square root and is therefore rational.<n><n>Input: If a ship could sail from New Orleans to Key West at 7.5 miles per hour, how long would it take to get there?<n>Output: That depends on if it was going upstream or downstream.<n>Since the question states the trip is 141 miles, at only 7.5 miles an hour, which would take 8.5 hours to complete at 7.5 mph, there is not enough time to complete the trip with only 7.5 m.p.h.<n>So the answer must be D

These tomatoes will stay fresh for no more than twenty days.  Thus, how many tomatoes does the shipment contain?<n>Answer: First, the given conditions are 417 supermarkets and it will take 20 days to fill in all of the supermarkets since they are 20days old.<n>417/20 gives us 20<n>As for the question, it seems that tomatos have a different level of freshness than other food. Hence, the first tomato to be sold is probably the freshest one and its shelf-life will last the longest of all. Thus, to maximize the amount of time we can use, we need to figure out which tomato lasts the shortest time.<n>Furthermore, tomatoes can only be sold in supermarkets of that there exists a fixed number of supermarkets where they can be sold meaning that each supermarket could hold a number of tomatoes not greater than that it can use for a day. But if it's the last day, the number of tomatoes it can store will be 0 if we assume that they are sold 5 days after they arrived. This makes us conclude that the number of tomatoes for each supermarket, per every day, is not greater than a number that cannot be calculated because of the unknown 417 in the question.<n>That is, we can write<n>417={d:n_d\space in\space\{{0,9},{20}\}}<n>where n_d is the number of tomatoes at the day d on the supermarket. In fact, it can be written as d=index*417/24, i.e. 417 /24 is one day. Hence, we know that n_0 must be 0 and n_{20} is the total number of tomatoes. n_d is equal to n_{d-1} at day d-1, n_{d-1}-\epsilon_1 to n_{d-2}-\epsilon_2 and so on. Let us look for an equation from the condition

Choices:  A: spinning wheel B: on a ladder C: hospital bed D: legroom E: grand piano<n>Output:		The correct response: A. Spinning wheel<n>Explanation :  Let us consider the options one by one:<n><n>**Option A: Spinning wheel  **<n>A spinning wheel will certainly have enough leg room for someone to lay on it if their legs are broken.<n><n>**Option B: On a ladder **<n>Ladder is a single straight rung and so, it is highly unlikely to have a broken leg rest elevated on it.<n><n>**Option D: Hospital Bed**<n>Though the other options can prove to be a bit problematic, a hospital bed is likely to have enough leg room for a broken leg.<n><n>**Option C: On a Grand Piano**<n>A grand piano is composed of a series of two side-by-side long narrow wooden frames stacked together which acts as both the keys and supports for the piano and is made to stand upright on a small raised base. As it is unlikely that a leg is broken on the piano, it is wrong.<n><n>**Option E: Legroom**<n>The option is incorrect as legroom means adequate space between the legs to move about and a person will hardly have that due to a broken leg<n><n>Input: Which of the following was not the name of the horse that won the 2016 Kentucky Derby? 1) Alvin Grier<n> 2) Nyquist<n>3) Trojan Nation<n>4) Bold Conquest<n>5) Brody’s Cause<n><n>Output: The correct answer is "Nyquist".<n><n>Explanation: Alvin Grier, Trojan Nation and Bold Conquest were  the first, third and fourth place winners in that order. While the name of Nyquist is not clear at first glimpse,  it is easy to guess that it might be the name of the winner by using a clue. Let us consider the names and try to figure out the winner’s name.<n><n>**Alvin Grier:**<n>Since the name starts with "Alvin" and is followed by a name of the "Grier" then it will be a name of the person. If you think of that this is the case then Alvin was the name of the horse.<n><n>**Nyquist:**<n>Since the word "Nyquist" comes immediately after Alvin then it is obvious that Alvin is not the winner

The store charges $1 to set up an account, and also charges two finance charges per month: 1.5% of the balance with no minimum and a flat $15 that does not vary based on the number of installments the customer chooses to pay. What interest rate does the customer actually pay?<n>Output: The question is asking for the effective interest rate given the specific conditions and the amount that the customer is paying in interest.  Because there is no minimum, the "real" interest depends on the total amount of interest paid (not just the balance). The flat rate implies that the finance charge is the interest rate and this is what will accumulate each month.  Thus,  $15 = (1*.5%)b = ((1.5%*.10)<n>b = ((1.15%.10)<n>b<n>b = ((115%.10).10)<n>b.<n>b = ((1)/(115)<n>b = ((*<n>b(10))<n>b = ((10)/(115))<n>b = ((*)<n>9.99%.<n><n>Input: In the following problem, the goal is to convert the expression x^3+y^3+3xy^2 to exponential form.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:Where would you find a binder containing homework assignments?

On one occasion a single warhead was launched.The blast was so intense that the air was thick with dust as the smoke and debris blew in all directions.How much area in square miles was affected by this blast? This is a difficult question because it has two variables.<n>Output: Given that the area of a circle is pi*r^2, the radius r is given by r=<<r=d/(pi*a)>>r=d/(\pi*a) where d is the diameter.  It is given that a=<<a=5 (I think it should be 5)>>5 and that the diameter is 20.<n>Thus, radius r=<<r=20/(pi*5)>>r=20/(\pi*5).<n>Therefore, an area of a circle of radius r is pi*r^3.<n>This means the affected area (i.e., the diameter d) is the first part of the solution, and the radius r is the second part of the solution.<n>So, solving for the diameter, pi*r^3/20=<<pi*r^3/r=5/0>>5/0.<n>Divide both sides by the radius r: 5(pi)/r=r, which cancels the r's. Then square root both sides since division by a radius is the same as squaring: r*r=<<r*r=5>>r=5.<n>Therefore, the radius is 5/0, which is undefined.<n>So the answer is 5 miles.<n><n>Input: If A and B are any two values, what is B^A? Choices: A: squared B: one over C: the exponent of D: none of these.<n>Output: The answer is "D" which means that given any two values A and B, the value of B to "the power of A" is the same as A.<n><n>Output: The correct choice is "B" which means that "the exponent of A" is 1.  A is used as a multiplier and is not evaluated.<n>Thus the value of AB, when evaluated,

If the number in the circle is -3, you would be true. But, there is no negative number in the circle, so statement line 6 is false.<n>Statement line 11 is false because 1 + 9 = 10 > -4.  But, the number in the circle cannot exceed -4, since there is a positive in the circle, the number in the circles MUST be less than or equal to -4, so statement line 11 is true.<n>Statement line 4 is false because 1 * 7 = 7 and statements line 11 is not true.  Therefore statement line 4 is true.<n>Statement Line 7 is false because 3 * 5 + 4 = 24  and -4 < 24 is false.  But, statement line 4 is not applicable, so statement line 7 is true.<n>Statement 18 is correct because if the number is negative you get true but if it is positive you get false.  And this is why statement line 16 is false.

Choices:  A: learn about subject B: learn new C: find truth D: is bliss E: judge<n>Output:		I believe ignorance is an excuse for many actions if they were not done with intent and evil. The intent of that ignorance is the key that will determine ignorance is a crime. I think ignorance is bliss. If ignorance were a crime then all of mankind would be in prison, including the very people who would enact the law. Therefore, ignorance will never be used as a crime. This law would be a crime against the ignorant because man is a naturally ignorant, foolish, and blind being, if he lived by such knowledge he would never learn anything (never go to college). I would say mankind will never learn much because the law must be in effect or man will be incarcerated on the spot, and never try to learn for fear of making a simple mistake and going to prison for it. This law will not be enforced because every single man will be in prison (those who know, and try to learn, in a mankind prison) and there will be no man who will know anything that is not on the books. If ignorance is a crime then ignorance will be enforced. The ignorant man can either give up all his intelligence, or become a criminal by making a mistake for fear of being imprisoned for it.<n><n>### Instruction: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a date in the format "dd/mm/yyyy". The first part of the program asks the user to enter the day in the form of a number from 1 to 31. The second part of the program asks for the month by prompting the user for a single digit. The month is then incrementally printed 1 to 12 starting with the first. The program continues until a value of 13 is requested for the month. The third part prompts the user for a 4 digit year, again using a single digit for each digit. The program ends when a user enters 13 for the month and the year. The program outputs the date in the format of month/day/year. A sample valid command line input and program output from the shell would be as follows:"2 5 2015 " or "2 5 2215". The prompts ask for the year, month, then day, in that order. The month prompt has the form of "Enter A digit 1 through 12: ", the "a" is optional

How much more fuel will he need to fill all 5,00 gallons?<n>Output:First, let's find the amount of fuel in his truck.<n>12 gallons/gallons=<<12 gallons/ gallons=12/12>>12/12=1<n>The harvest truck holds 1 gallon of fuel. The capacity of the combine is equal to the amount in the truck.<n>5000 gallons/1 gallons=<<1 gallons=5000>>5000/5000<n>Since 12 is the same as 5000 divided by 5000<n>The new answer becomes 12.<n>Input:The U.S. Postal Service has recently begun shipping packages to other countries.

A tank of gas holds 10 gallons. Determine the number of miles that a car can travel when filled up and a number of times it will be filled up using the following data. A trip can be 1350 miles long and that is twice as long as the shortest trip. A car travels 65 miles out the each way on one round trip.  The car fills up on the way home from a trip.<n>Output: On each round trip, the total amount of miles driven is 65*2=<<65*2=130>>130. The total amount of miles on the first short trip, the second long trip, the 2  short trips, and the one long trip are 38*5=<<38*5=190>>190, 190, 78, and 190, respectively. The amount of miles driven when the car's tank is full is 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 and the amount of miles driven when tank is half empty is 10*(5/2)=<<10*(5/1/2)1/2>1/2 which is 10*2=<<10*2=20>>2, therefore, the total amount of money spent is 50+2+190-1/2*4*2=<<50+2+(190-1)/2*4*2>>200 which can be simplified to 50+2*190/4=-163.<n>Therefore, the first two problems can be simplified to:<n>If a car travels a distance d on its first short trip, and d/2 on its second short trip, then the amount of time spent traveling to get back home should be d/30, not d/13.<n>

(All numbers are positive.) 483 people are in line at a cash register, waiting to pay for their goods. Some of those in line left their shopping bags at the checkout counter, because the cashier did not know which lane to direct them to before they entered the line. The cash register is set up in a way that if the total is even, the line should go to the left end of the checkout counter, and if the total is odd, the line should go the right. Of the people in line, 427 know what to do with their bags, while only 56 were waiting to be told whether to go left or right. How many people were going to the correct side?<n>Output:427/2=<<427/2>=214.<n>Since all the people who know how to go to the right or left were 56 so 371 more people have no idea where to line so the 14 are left<n>

Most of the residents either work in the town or in the surrounding farmlands.  Each resident would like to visit downtown at least once weekly.  There is one bus stop downtown that will take each resident to and from town. There is only one bus driver who drives all the buses. No matter how the buses are distributed, there must be an even number of buses to accommodate the downtown visits from the residents. How many residents does the town have?<n>Output: The bus pick-up places in the small town must have an even number of pick-up places. From the solution above, there must be 2 bus stops in each direction, 4 bus stops in all, to permit all residents to visit the downtown area at least once per week.<n><n>Solution:<n>Each pick-up location (1 in town or 1 on the edge of a farm) requires a bus. But the number of buses can be minimized by having fewer bus stops so that each town resident can go to the farmlands and each farmland person can go to town.<n><n>Let's assume that the town and the bus stops are all in the same place and that there is no town (town buses) and no farmland (farm buses).  Then there are 2 buses (total) for 5 stops total.<n><n>If 5 buses are too many buses, then there is no solution.  Therefore there will be 2 buses for 5 stops or 25 town residents can use the town buses to reach the farmlands and<n>there will be 2 bus stops total with 10 residents using the farmland buses to visit the town or there will be no bus stop for town residents to reach the farmland with 0 bus stops with 30 town residents using the farmlands buses to go to town.<n>Therefore any solution will have 2 bus stops total (1 in the town and one in the farmland to reach the downtown<n>area once per week for 10 residents) plus town residents.

Which of these plans is most advantageous if the car is kept for 72 months?<n>Output: Option (3) is the most profitable.<n><n>Input: On a recent trip from Washington, DC to Miami, the two pilots on the plane made the following observations: The plane lost its altitude (the height above the ground) 344 miles into the trip and regained 264 miles back towards the final destination. The plane flew horizontally at an average speed of 0.714 times the speed of sound. (The speed of sound is 0.76 times the speed of light in the atmosphere.) Determine the speed of the plane at the point of losing altitude (loss).<n>Output: The plane lost altitude 344 miles from the start of the trip and regained this altitude 264 miles from the start. Let us call the change in altitude d =<<d =>>-264. (Since we start at altitude 0, we need to use - instead of = when d>0; then the plane gained altitude.)<n>Since d =<<d =>264, and v =0.714c, we can say that d/v =<<d/v =>>-0.27, and that 264/0.27 = <<264/067 =>>947.5 altitude is regained per mile per minute per second at the average speed of 0814 times speed of sound. The plane then regains altitude 947.5/1233 =<<947.5//1233 = 7.8>>7.8 seconds after losing altitude.<n>Thus, the time elapsed from the point of loss to regaining altitude is - 264 - 7.8 = <<-26

She was rightfully concerned that the smoke caused by the burning will harm her 6-year-old daughter. Sarah lived in an apartment and didn't feel she could  do anything about the smoke problem, but did go to the school to report to the teachers what her daughter was going though. She  spoke about it too the principal. The principal informed the smoke was a health hazard and said that since the smoke was annoying a large number of people including Sarah's daughter, he could have the school groundskeeper remove the burning pile of yard waste and prevent any other burning from taking place. He did inform any people they should take any smoke into consideration into how they do their yard-work from now on.<n>Output:When a person is annoyed they suffer a state of anger, frustration or upset. The annoyance of Sarah was a result of something that another person is doing that infringes on her rights or rights of others around here, which would be Sarah's daughter. The annoyance Sarah experiences could be caused by a variety of things. A person does not always have the authority to address their own annoyance. Sarah does not have the authority to tell the smoke generator (the lady burning) what they can and can not burn. She does not have the authority (within a law) to tell to stop the burning, but she was able to relay the problem she and her daughter was experiencing with the burning to the principal who is the person who does have the authority to tell burner how to perform her burning habits. The principal was able to resolve the problem by telling the smoker to stop the burning or have it removed since it poses as a problem to students and staff at the school.<n>

I believe the 60 mph is for each car. Meaning, they need 60 of the trucs to go to the higher ground.<n><n>Comment: This is not an answer...the two cars are the answer. Since one car can hold 20 cows, 60x20=200 cars are needed. 60 cars per day times (11 days) give 660 trips. Times 2 drivers in each car (trip?) gives (660)2  or 1320 total trips. Average 18 miles per hour each, total time 1320/18 = 73.33 average trip. Round to 85 cars trips. That's ~4.25 hours per trip. If they have 60 cars in reserve, (4.25)(60) = 257, 257+60 ~277 hour round-trip total. I'll take 232 hours.<n><n>Comment: To clarify "and then if you add 60 to that they get"...you need to find the total number of trips. If you have 20 cars per day, you'll need 20 x 60/20 = 300 round trip cars. 4 days is 4 x 20/20 =80 total trips. The answer (

How much will the company make if they have 30.12%% of revenue increase every month?<n>Output: In order to answer this, the 30% gain in revenue monthly (360 days) must be multiplied by the same 30% figure: 7.62 x 360 = (7.62 x30) x 360 ==><n>2489.99 or just over 2490 to the nearest cent.<n>Notice that when answering questions like this where you know the growth rate, if the monthly multiplier is X, then the answer, (which is X multiplied by a month such as March for example) will be.360 multiplied by X which will always give the same answer. So, 2489.670. In other words, 2490.<n><n>Input: What is the next term in the arithmetic sequence 9, 5, 2, -4, 1, -8?<n>Output: 11<n>Because 4 is getting closer and closer to 0, and 1, in the sequence, is already at 0, the terms, when multiplied by 4, are getting ever more negative. When the previous term is multiplied by 4 and is the only term that is less than 0, then the following term will be positive, as if the sequence goes -4,1,-8, and that previous term is 1, then the following term, 9, is positive.<n><n>Input: Find the value of x + y<n>Output: x=4, y=3<n><n>Input: A 2

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:What body of water is typically shallow water? Choices:  A: lake B: aquariums C: swimming pool D: pond E: childrens pools<n>Output:		A: lake<n>A lake is defined as still water with an area between land and the water line of more than 9 hectares and not more than 100 hectares, which is fed by rivers.<n><n>An aquarium is a small tank which is generally used to keep small animals, or a group of animals.<n><n>A swimming pool is a body of artificially filled water which used for swimming.<n><n>A pond is defined as a pool in shallow water, and may not meet the lake definition given above. It may be created by glacial meltwater, a dam, or rainwater accumulation.<n><n>A childrens pool is a pool (most often a small wading pool) made for children with low water height.<n><n>#### # Input:The temperature outside will be below zero degrees Fahrenheit for the next 13 days. How many degrees below zero at day 13?<n>#### # Output: The temperature outside at day 13 is 13 degrees below 32.<n><n><n>input: The temperature outside will be below 32 degrees Fahrenheit for 13 days.<n>The temperature will be 32 or below for each of the first 12 days.<n>There are 13 in a row of days, beginning with day 12.  Each day can be expressed uniquely in number of digits, e.g., 1st = 1, 2nd = 2, etc.  Each day will be 1 digit longer than the one before it.<n>Since the number of days will be the same, there will be 13 digits altogether (13 x (1 + 2 +... + 12)).  For each of those 13 digits, take its numerical value and add it to the number of that day in the sequence, in order to determine the temperature.  The result is 32 + the day’s temperature, where the sum cannot be greater than 3 * 12 (3 * 12 is greater than 32, therefore this is needed to allow our number system to make sense of the situation).  Each number has a maximum value of 10 which corresponds to the temperature that can be taken.  So, 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, where 6 + 6 (day 6’s temperature) = 12.  1

Choices:  B: 12 C: 3 D: 40 E: 15 F: 240<n>Output: F has the right answer (15).<n>A single four digit number ending with 910 would have to start with "0003" or "0014" etc, or some other combination that ends in an 8 and does not result in the "wrong" ending digit. This implies we have "n-8-9-10". It follows that there are 99 -8-8=<<99-8=91>>91 combinations that can produce a 4-digit number ending

Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:You might head to the locker room after getting a green drink here.

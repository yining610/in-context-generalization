Is there a way to solve this problem in C++?\n\nOne solution is to just use the standard subtraction process to subtract the two numbers and then just solve that using the regular addition process.  The problem with this solution is that it only works for negative numbers that have two digits.  This is not a good solution.\n\nAnother solution was to just get the numbers added a different way.

How many sheets of paper can you cut with the given supplies?\nOutput: How many sheets can you cut depends on how much paper you want to cut; so, there is no single correct answer, though you can cut at most 5 sheets.\nIf you want to cut only one sheet of paper, using the given supplies, there will be enough space to align one staple, one length of scissors, and one sheet of paper.\n\nIf you want to have enough room to cut multiple sheets of paper, then you should first use your stapler on one sheet of paper.  \nThen you should cut your stapled sheet into two or more smaller sheets of paper, or even shorter pieces, so that you can align one line of staples, one length of scisisors, and one sheet or shorter piece of paper.  \nAssuming you want to cut at least one sheet of paper, the number of sheets you can cut, c, satisfies c<=<<c<=4>><=4.\n\nSo we have an upper bound of 4, but how about a lower bound?   \nThe shortest length on two sheets of paper is the distance between their midpoints.\nThe midpoint of one sheet is the center of the sheet\u2014one half of it.  The midpoint of two sheets of paper is just the sum of the two halves of the individual sheet, or 1 + 1 = 2.   \nTherefore any two small sheets (e.g., smaller than or equal 2) can be safely stapled together.  \nYou are now left with a stack of paper that is approximately 2 inches tall.   \nBut how about three?

{"idx": 174, "text": "The Family room\n\nThe ficus does not look good in a Salon\n\nIt looks okay in the kitchen, but you would need a large one, that would take up too much of that space.\n\nThe tropical forest is too unpredictable as it can lead to a lot of extra cost and responsibility in upkeep.  It requires a lot of watering, fertilizer, and also needs to have a lot of attention and care.  A ficus is an indoor plant, and it is unlikely that it will die in such an environment.\nThe family room is the best environment for a ficus as it is where you want people in your home to be more comfortable with their surroundings.\n\nTo answer this question fully, you need to look into the characteristics of the house as well as the characteristics of the ficus.  You should answer the question by knowing the facts and not by just judging by appearance. The facts about ficus and a family room are as follows:\n\nFacts about the ficus:\n\n    Fact 1:\n        It needs lots of space\n\n    Fact 2:\n        It requires lots of attention and care.\n\n    Fact 3:\n        It needs a pot that drains well\n\n    Fact 4:\n        It cannot live in a small pot for long periods of time.\n\nFacts about a family room:\n\n    Fact:\n        People go to the family room to have comfort.\n\n    Fact: \n        The family room is the main room of the house and is the most used room.\n\n    Fact\n        The family room allows plenty of space to put other plants as well if desired.\n\n    Fact    \n        There is less need for people to take care of the ficus as compared to the other plants.  You don't have to worry about watering the plants everyday or even every other day.\n\nSo the answer should be \"Family Room\" because the above facts say if you have a family room, you also have everything the ficus needs.\n\nInput:The ficus does not need much water because it can live happily in an environment with less water.\n\nYou can water the ficus once every other week, although the ficus tree is able to live without any water.

If you live the rest of your life in your home the air you breathed when you were living there will only have been breathed by the people inside that house. A train station is somewhere that you are likely to stop to rest or go shopping and is usually open to the public so air in there has been breathed by other people. A cupboard would just be full of air that you can breathe when your air runs out. A cricket stadium would be open to the public so, as with a train station, the air inside has been breathed by lots of people but it is possible that the people in the stadium were very young so might not have needed much air.

The cupboard only contains the air that the people breathe and the air that they breathe isn't contained to the cupboard, it just goes on blowing out of their mouth in other rooms of the house.

You find 4 choices for eggs available in supermarket:1. Whole egg2. Egg without shell3. Egg without shell4. Whole egg\nOutput: The question is a little tricky. What is the correct answer? It is obvious that choice 4 is a whole egg, and choice 1 is an egg without shell. The choices 2 and 3 are also obvious, because the question says \"available in supermarket\", which means that choices of an egg either with or without a shell are available in supermarket.\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 1 and 3 or 3 and 1, but not 4 and 1, because if it is 4 and 1 that would mean your first egg is missing a shell. Therefore, you should choose 2 or 3 over 4 and 1.\n\n-\n##Solution\n\nIn the first instruction, we convert $ in terms of %, by multiplying 100% and we get 20.

He starts a home-rental business and uses the home as a rental.  Each month he will take the difference between the rental income and the mortgage cost and place that amount in a savings account.  The man can place $2000/month in the savings account.  After 4 years, how much money will be in his savings account?\nOutput: The rental income is $1800. The mortgage payment is $1200.\nThe $1000 payment that is paid off each month of the mortgage is $120,000 that was paid out.\nIn four years, the first month will have paid off half of the loan. That amount is $6,000.\nThe second month will pay off another $3000. The interest is paid off as money is made available. So after four years, the interest is gone and is no longer paid.\nThese 9000 are placed in the savings account for 4 * 12 months = 48 months or almost four years.\nThe monthly investment in the savings account is $1000 for the first month and $300 thereafter to cover the interest. So the principal is not touched and remains at $6000. So the interest is $400.\nSo 48 months at $400/month gives $19,200.\nSo the total is $19200 plus the $6000 from the mortgage payment = $25,200\n\nInput: What does a \"C\" represent in mathematics?

Of course, the play is fictional and there are no plans to start taking pounds of anyone\u2019s flesh.  (A pound is about 16 ounces.).\nOutput:The original play was an 1598 stage play written by William Shakespeare.\nIt is set in Venice and centers around a deal between a Jewish man, Antonio, and a famous Venetian.\nAntonio is in need of money to secure his own business and requests a loan from the famous Venetian, for which the latter will receive a pound of Antonio\u2019s flesh if the former doesn\u2019t repay the loan, which the latter does.\nIn the original play, the flesh is to be received by the Venetian in front of the judges in the marketplace, where the other characters of the play, friends of Antonio, are gathered.\nThe phrase to forfeit a flesh is still a common idiom in common vernacular.So the final and the tr\n\nInput:In Shakespeare\u2019s play, the terms of the loan are unusual, but the fact that William Shakespeare has borrowed from earlier sources is not unusual.\nIt appears the expression is derived from an earlier poem by Thomas Wyatt.

What is the probability that neither suffer negative effects from the drug?\nOutput: The probability of each patient having no adverse effects is given by the factor of 1/(1-0.3), so the probability of a double event of both patients being without adverse effects is simply the product of the individual probabilities: the probability of the first patient not experiencing any side effects is the multiplicative factor of 1/(0.7) and the probability of the second patient NOT experiencing any side effects being the multiplicative factor again of 1/(0,7).\nTherefore the final answer is 1/(0.3*(1/(0.7))*(1/(0.3)))\n\n### Problem Set A: Probability\n\n# Include the following libraries in your code.\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn import svm\nfrom sklearn import cluster\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis as LDA\nimport statsmodels.api as sm \nimport seaborn\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler as MMS\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC # SVM is short for Support Vector Machine\nfrom sklearn import datasets\n# SVC is a supervised learning algorithm. \nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression \n# Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algo. which is used for binary classification.\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n# GaussianNaiveBayes is another supervised learning algorithm, similar to Logistic\nclassify_patient = datasets['mushroom']\n\n# Splitting up the mushroom dataset for training and testing\nx_train, x_", "answer": "C: illness"}

If not, then the time between dinner and bed would be longer.\nHence, given the dinner is a working dinner,  there are many different possible scenarios for the completion of each section.\nBased on the 3-courses and no coffee or dessert, we  can reason 30 to 50 minutes for eating time; based on our 75 minute bedtime, with at least 45 minutes of sleep at 10:30pm, and the 45 minute travel time between dinning and bed, 33 minutes or more would have to have eaten; and 45 minutes or at least 2 hours is spent sleeping.\nAssume we have 33 minutes between dinner and bed to prepare to get to bed.

{"idx": 338, "text": "A: asia\n\nInput: In a 1974 study, researchers found it was possible to make an average person laugh when they showed funny pictures to them.  Then the subjects rated how funny they found the picture on a scale of 1 to 5.  For example, they might rate a picture of a comical wiener dog as a 4 (\"funny\").  The researchers found a strong correlation between their ratings of the pictures with the number of actual laughs they produced.  The more funny they thought the picture was, the more likely they were to laugh.  A question was posed in a magazine asking: \"What is the average amount of laughter produced?\"  How would you solve this type of problem?\nOutput: First, find a table of values of actual laughs produced by pictures and corresponding picture ratings.\nFind the regression equation to determine the correlation equation.\nSo the average number of laughs is approximately 860/1000=<<860/1,000=.86>>.86\n\nInput: A survey showed the average salary of U.S. physicians is $124,000, with a standard deviation of $35,000.

From where we are travelling to where. So the answer should be no.\n- Let us ignore the parking time in city for the moment so it's only about 76 days\n- If it takes 10 days more it will take more than 259 days.\n- So bus will be a bad choice\n- A is ticket to stadium or a ticket to station\n- If its stadium then we should also assume we have a game at home stadium\n- To get from to stadium we spend 149 days because in every 6 days a game takes place\n- If the game is at home, we can simply get from home to stadium, otherwise we have to spend more 149-55=84 days to go outside from home and then spend 76 days to get the stadium which was 149 days.\n\n- So 31 days will be spend when we are at home stadium.\n\n- We can change our stadium every 6 day to save time.

After the initial placement of pieces a choice of game over or keep playing may be chosen by the player who made the last move. If game over is chosen, then the winner is the player who can first make four in a row.

There are a total of 38 possibilities between 39 and 47, and at each elevation 10 possibilities. So there are a total of 10x38 possibilities at elevations between 39 and a total of 48 possibilities that meet the requirements.\n\nOutput: We already have 48 possibilities. We have to eliminate the following possibilities to solve: At any elevations of between 47 and 100 meters. There cannot be any more possibilities above 47 meters, since we already ruled this possibility out. Similarly, above 50 meters. The only possibilities that remain are those between 48 and 100, but then the only requirement left is that it cannot grow above 50 meters, which leaves us at 49 possibilities.\nSo there are 49 possible elevations where the fruit can grow between 39 and above 50 meters that will work.\n\nInput: Solve the following equation for X: 6-9/x=8-2/x+1\nOutput: X = 3.5", "answer": "D: further education"}

What is the length of the shortest paper, in words, that the student can submit without being penalized?\nOutput:The length of the shortest acceptable paper, in words, is 1,201.\nSince a 1,208 word paper is slightly less than 1,250 words, the student must drop two words; thus, the paper's length would be 1,206 words, not 1,207 words, and then the student could subtract one more word, yielding 1,205 words.\nSince a 450 word paper is less than 1,400 words, the student's paper may not be longer than 1,399 words.\nAnd since a 1,451 word paper is just 4 words short of 1,455 words, the student'smay not surpass 1,454 words.\nSo the minimum acceptable length is 1,264 words and the maximum acceptable length is 1454 words.

{"idx": 509, "text": "I think (C) would be the correct answer\nInput: Which is the correct code?\nThe answer is BCD.\nInput: A shipment of tomatoes has arrived in Portland, Maine, and they must go to 417 different supermarkets throughout the state.  These tomatoes will stay fresh for no more than twenty days.  Thus, how many tomatoes does the shipment contain?\nAnswer: First, the given conditions are 417 supermarkets and it will take 20 days to fill in all of the supermarkets since they are 20days old.\n417/20 gives us 20\nAs for the question, it seems that tomatos have a different level of freshness than other food. Hence, the first tomato to be sold is probably the freshest one and its shelf-life will last the longest of all. Thus, to maximize the amount of time we can use, we need to figure out which tomato lasts the shortest time.\nFurthermore, tomatoes can only be sold in supermarkets of that there exists a fixed number of supermarkets where they can be sold meaning that each supermarket could hold a number of tomatoes not greater than that it can use for a day. But if it's the last day, the number of tomatoes it can store will be 0 if we assume that they are sold 5 days after they arrived. This makes us conclude that the number of tomatoes for each supermarket, per every day, is not greater than a number that cannot be calculated because of the unknown 417 in the question.\nThat is, we can write\n417={d:n_d\\space in\\space\\{{0,9},{20}\\}}\nwhere n_d is the number of tomatoes at the day d on the supermarket. In fact, it can be written as d=index*417/24, i.e. 417 /24 is one day. Hence, we know that n_0 must be 0 and n_{20} is the total number of tomatoes. n_d is equal to n_{d-1} at day d-1, n_{d-1}-\\epsilon_1 to n_{d-2}-\\epsilon_2 and so on.

The store charges $1 to set up an account, and also charges two finance charges per month: 1.5% of the balance with no minimum and a flat $15 that does not vary based on the number of installments the customer chooses to pay. What interest rate does the customer actually pay?\nOutput: The question is asking for the effective interest rate given the specific conditions and the amount that the customer is paying in interest.  Because there is no minimum, the \"real\" interest depends on the total amount of interest paid (not just the balance). The flat rate implies that the finance charge is the interest rate and this is what will accumulate each month.  Thus,  $15 = (1*.5%)b = ((1.5%*.10)\nb = ((1.15%.10)\nb\nb = ((115%.10).10)\nb.\nb = ((1)/(115)\nb = ((*\nb(10))\nb = ((10)/(115))\nb = ((*)\n9.99%.\n\nInput: In the following problem, the goal is to convert the expression x^3+y^3+3xy^2 to exponential form.

On one occasion a single warhead was launched.The blast was so intense that the air was thick with dust as the smoke and debris blew in all directions.How much area in square miles was affected by this blast? This is a difficult question because it has two variables.\nOutput: Given that the area of a circle is pi*r^2, the radius r is given by r=<<r=d/(pi*a)>>r=d/(\\pi*a) where d is the diameter.  It is given that a=<<a=5 (I think it should be 5)>>5 and that the diameter is 20.\nThus, radius r=<<r=20/(pi*5)>>r=20/(\\pi*5).\nTherefore, an area of a circle of radius r is pi*r^3.\nThis means the affected area (i.e., the diameter d) is the first part of the solution, and the radius r is the second part of the solution.\nSo, solving for the diameter, pi*r^3/20=<<pi*r^3/r=5/0>>5/0.\nDivide both sides by the radius r: 5(pi)/r=r, which cancels the r's. Then square root both sides since division by a radius is the same as squaring: r*r=<<r*r=5>>r=5.\nTherefore, the radius is 5/0, which is undefined.\nSo the answer is 5 miles.\n\nInput: If A and B are any two values, what is B^A? Choices: A: squared B: one over C: the exponent of D: none of these.\nOutput: The answer is \"D\" which means that given any two values A and B, the value of B to \"the power of A\" is the same as A.\n\nOutput: The correct choice is \"B\" which means that \"the exponent of A\" is 1.

{"idx": 647, "text": "I believe ignorance is an excuse for many actions if they were not done with intent and evil. The intent of that ignorance is the key that will determine ignorance is a crime. I think ignorance is bliss. If ignorance were a crime then all of mankind would be in prison, including the very people who would enact the law. Therefore, ignorance will never be used as a crime. This law would be a crime against the ignorant because man is a naturally ignorant, foolish, and blind being, if he lived by such knowledge he would never learn anything (never go to college). I would say mankind will never learn much because the law must be in effect or man will be incarcerated on the spot, and never try to learn for fear of making a simple mistake and going to prison for it. This law will not be enforced because every single man will be in prison (those who know, and try to learn, in a mankind prison) and there will be no man who will know anything that is not on the books.

A tank of gas holds 10 gallons. Determine the number of miles that a car can travel when filled up and a number of times it will be filled up using the following data. A trip can be 1350 miles long and that is twice as long as the shortest trip. A car travels 65 miles out the each way on one round trip.  The car fills up on the way home from a trip.\nOutput: On each round trip, the total amount of miles driven is 65*2=<<65*2=130>>130.

(All numbers are positive.) 483 people are in line at a cash register, waiting to pay for their goods. Some of those in line left their shopping bags at the checkout counter, because the cashier did not know which lane to direct them to before they entered the line. The cash register is set up in a way that if the total is even, the line should go to the left end of the checkout counter, and if the total is odd, the line should go the right. Of the people in line, 427 know what to do with their bags, while only 56 were waiting to be told whether to go left or right. How many people were going to the correct side?\nOutput:427/2=<<427/2>=214.\nSince all the people who know how to go to the right or left were 56 so 371 more people have no idea where to line so the 14 are left", "answer": "A: pocket"}

If you drive a 1000 miles then you would cover around 16.66 miles per hour (assuming your car is moving at 20km/h). For the hundred times you got hit you would cover around 200km (assuming you got hit every 6.66 minutes).

Most of the residents either work in the town or in the surrounding farmlands.  Each resident would like to visit downtown at least once weekly.  There is one bus stop downtown that will take each resident to and from town. There is only one bus driver who drives all the buses. No matter how the buses are distributed, there must be an even number of buses to accommodate the downtown visits from the residents. How many residents does the town have?\nOutput: The bus pick-up places in the small town must have an even number of pick-up places. From the solution above, there must be 2 bus stops in each direction, 4 bus stops in all, to permit all residents to visit the downtown area at least once per week.\n\nSolution:\nEach pick-up location (1 in town or 1 on the edge of a farm) requires a bus. But the number of buses can be minimized by having fewer bus stops so that each town resident can go to the farmlands and each farmland person can go to town.\n\nLet's assume that the town and the bus stops are all in the same place and that there is no town (town buses) and no farmland (farm buses).  Then there are 2 buses (total) for 5 stops total.\n\nIf 5 buses are too many buses, then there is no solution.  Therefore there will be 2 buses for 5 stops or 25 town residents can use the town buses to reach the farmlands and\nthere will be 2 bus stops total with 10 residents using the farmland buses to visit the town or there will be no bus stop for town residents to reach the farmland with 0 bus stops with 30 town residents using the farmlands buses to go to town.\nTherefore any solution will have 2 bus stops total (1 in the town and one in the farmland to reach the downtown\narea once per week for 10 residents) plus town residents.

The plane flew horizontally at an average speed of 0.714 times the speed of sound. (The speed of sound is 0.76 times the speed of light in the atmosphere.) Determine the speed of the plane at the point of losing altitude (loss).\nOutput: The plane lost altitude 344 miles from the start of the trip and regained this altitude 264 miles from the start. Let us call the change in altitude d =<<d =>>-264. (Since we start at altitude 0, we need to use - instead of = when d>0; then the plane gained altitude.)\nSince d =<<d =>264, and v =0.714c, we can say that d/v =<<d/v =>>-0.27, and that 264/0.27 = <<264/067 =>>947.5 altitude is regained per mile per minute per second at the average speed of 0814 times speed of sound. The plane then regains altitude 947.5/1233 =<<947.5//1233 = 7.8>>7.8 seconds after losing altitude.\nThus, the time elapsed from the point of loss to regaining altitude is - 264 - 7.8 = <<-26", "answer": "C: large city"}

She was rightfully concerned that the smoke caused by the burning will harm her 6-year-old daughter. Sarah lived in an apartment and didn't feel she could  do anything about the smoke problem, but did go to the school to report to the teachers what her daughter was going though. She  spoke about it too the principal. The principal informed the smoke was a health hazard and said that since the smoke was annoying a large number of people including Sarah's daughter, he could have the school groundskeeper remove the burning pile of yard waste and prevent any other burning from taking place. He did inform any people they should take any smoke into consideration into how they do their yard-work from now on.\nOutput:When a person is annoyed they suffer a state of anger, frustration or upset. The annoyance of Sarah was a result of something that another person is doing that infringes on her rights or rights of others around here, which would be Sarah's daughter. The annoyance Sarah experiences could be caused by a variety of things. A person does not always have the authority to address their own annoyance. Sarah does not have the authority to tell the smoke generator (the lady burning) what they can and can not burn. She does not have the authority (within a law) to tell to stop the burning, but she was able to relay the problem she and her daughter was experiencing with the burning to the principal who is the person who does have the authority to tell burner how to perform her burning habits. The principal was able to resolve the problem by telling the smoker to stop the burning or have it removed since it poses as a problem to students and staff at the school.", "answer": "D: agony"}

I believe the 60 mph is for each car. Meaning, they need 60 of the trucs to go to the higher ground.\n\nComment: This is not an answer...the two cars are the answer. Since one car can hold 20 cows, 60x20=200 cars are needed. 60 cars per day times (11 days) give 660 trips. Times 2 drivers in each car (trip?) gives (660)2  or 1320 total trips. Average 18 miles per hour each, total time 1320/18 = 73.33 average trip. Round to 85 cars trips. That's ~4.25 hours per trip.

Let A represent the event of marrying a person in the total population, and let B represent the event of marry\nof marrying a person who is of a different race. In order to evaluate the probability of A given B we need to find that all of the people whom you marry (and all of the other people in the total population) are of a\ndifferent race. In other words, given the event that you marry someone of a different race the only remaining persons for marriage are people who are not in your population. We then subtract the probability that you marry someone\nof your own race from 1 (the proportion who will eventually marry). The result is the probability that you marry a person of a different race, given that you marry someone else.\n\nInput: Suppose the probability with which any individual marries is.05 and that a person is equally likely to marry a person of their own ethnic group or a person of a different ethnic group. The probability of a person marrying people\nof the same ethnic group is p =.125. Suppose we want to compute the probability of marriage given a different ethnic group marriage, P(b|p), and are assuming the sample sizes are 100 in both groups.\nOutput: We are given\n.05*100/100 = 0.05\nWe then know that our marriage happens because we are randomly choosing someone.

You will find two integer  variables named \"value\" and \"index\" that determine the values in the matrix.  The value variable determines what value is stored in each particular location of the matrix and the index variable determines which row and column that particular value goes into.\n\n---\n\nInput to the program:\n\nThe following variables will be input to the program.  In each case, these variables will be set to a value which you supply to the program during execution.  The input values should be integers and can be passed either as integers themselves or as the decimal equivalent. There is a max value for each variable:\n\n> value\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue (integer)\n>\n> index\t\t\t\t\tindex (integer)\nIt is assumed that the \"value\" variable will always be less than or equal to the \"index\" variable.  The program will assume that the \"value\" is less than or equal to (whichever of these two values is smaller), \"24\".\n\nOutput from the program:\nOnce the variables are input, the program will then output the value of the cells from these inputs.  For example, with input value = 5 and input index = 4, the output should be 5; with input value = 3 and input index = 6, the output should be -9.\n\nThe outputs from the individual cells of a matrix can be obtained as follows: The value of the cell is returned from where [index - (index/2) modulus rows] == (cellIndex - rowIndex) modulus rows; for example, the values of [3,6] (5,0) (2,13) (8,-4)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\t<a href=\"../P1/P1-2.html\">Previous: P1-2</a>\n</p><p align=\"center\">Next: P1-4</p>", "answer": "C: spreadsheet"}

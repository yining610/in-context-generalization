It takes him 10 minutes to drive to the grocery story if he uses no side roads.  On the way, he passes two stoplights.  For the first light, he gets stuck at the red light 60% of the time.  For the second light, he gets stuck 75% of the time. If he had to stop every time a red light, how far would he have to travel before getting home?\nOutput: This one I kinda struggled with because one of the steps you have to use to find the answer asks for you to round up to the nearest 10%.  I've never been good at rounding to the nearest 1.\nAnyway I first rounded up to the nearest 3 as in one stoplight is for 3 minutes and the second is 4 minutes and if you add them with no waiting on red lights, it is like 8 minutes.\nThen I went to the part where I needed to check if the total was less than 2 hours.  The total was like 135 and 2 hours is 120, so I decided to take out the extra 5 with the rounding error.\nThen after checking the 135 was less than 2, I did one more check.  I took out 7 and then added 5 again and made it so that it was 2*10% and then it was like 13.33.\nThen I rounded it up again to make it equal to 14.\nSince the question asked what distance I could travel if the light were on red every time, I then looked at the distance from downtown to where I was in the question and subtracted it from 14, with an extra 5 added on.\nThen I got 2255 feet or 0.45 miles.\nThen I changed it from miles to feet and it said there was an error because there was a different unit in the answer.  So I just used 0.46 miles.\nIn the end, the answer ends up being 0.46\n\nInput: A small country had a population of 1,000,000", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

That left 0.52 dollars that they got back.\nThen they bought 0.52/0.2 = <<0.52/1=2.7>>2.7 widgets for free.\nThen each widget they bought ended up costing 0.24-.2=<<0.52/2.7=0.2>>-0.2 dollars.  Each widget cost after discounts 0.2-.24 = <<0.2-.2-0.2>> -0.2 dollars.  \nRanging all that in order, each widget cost the original price of 48 / (378 / 9) = <<48/378/9=1.7>>1.7 dollars.\nSince the total was 378/9 = <<378/9=>400>>400 widgets, they saved 400/1.7 = <<400/114=3.4>>3.4 dollars because each widget cost about 43 dollars.\nSo the total", "answer": "B: have rest"}

The two leafy vegetables were interchangeable to customers so many customers bought more spinach when romaine was no longer available.  With the sale price of romaine no longer in use, how much total revenue did the supermarket earn, in dollars?\nAnswer: When romaine was sold out, it was the lowest priced vegetable so when they put spinach on sale after, the revenue went up to 2245 (2*1125). The revenue went down when romaine was out because the price of spinach sold at a higher price than romaine. Therefore, when romaine was being sold at 1 dollar and spinach being sold at 2 dollar, the total revenue earned went by spinach but when romaine was gone they put back its price as 2 dollars leaving the revenue to go to 1 and if the price of spinach remained as 2 dollars then the total revenue that they earned would have gone even higher as we multiply it by the number of spinach that they sold(2*3000).\n\nTotal Revenue earned: \n\nTotal Revenue: (3000+3050+1125)+(3000+2*1124)+[(5+5)*2245]=\t\n(3000*5+1125*5+968)=<<3000* 5 +1125* 5 +968 = 5433>>5433 + 4951 + 968 = 10552\n\nSo the final answer would be: 10551", "answer": "B: mall"}

However, these methods don't calculate the answers too quickly. To improve such time, we will introduce another  method by looking at the answer choices of multiple choice questions. \n\n### Method:To calculate an answer with less time consumption, we can determine how long it took us to understand the question and how much less time the answer can be calculated with the choices given.  \n\nWe will first calculate the amount of time it took to understand the question into a time unit that we can calculate, lets say minutes for example. And in a minuted question, we need the answer to be calculated in seconds. And the answer can only be calculated in seconds and not minutes. And by rearranging the time question, we can determine the amount of time left by subtracting the amount of time it takes us to understand the question. \n\n#### Time calculation:Given an answer choice, we can estimate the amount of time it will need to understand the answer.\nFor example:  Assume we took 90 seconds to understand the question. If, we had 10 minutes, how long will it take for the answer to get calculated by the answer choices?\n\n90/60 = 9/5\n9/5 = 1.", "answer": "D: attractive appearance"}

Which sales days will have the 10% discount on products?\nOutput:If you take the fraction 60/100 and multiply it by the given price, you get what you pay for in 60% off. You then subtract 19.5 or 68% of the price.\nSo since the price was $100, you now have $100-$69.5 or $40.5.\nThen from 70% off sale prices, you take what you pay for in the fraction and multiply that by $40.5 to find out your prices. 40.5 is 24.25 and you can now use that to get your original price.\n40.5/24.25=$0.17 or nearly 20 cents\nSo each Tuesday when the sale is on would have the 100% discount.\n\nInput: A box of tissues costs $6.50 and contains 24 tissue boxes.

Suppose the last number is 2. The last monkey receives the number 2 and subtracts one from its current number, which is still 3. Then the last monkey passes 1, and then the next monkey gets 2 and subtracts 1, and passes 1. Soon, a monkey with sequence 1 will be assigned. The 1 is passed down and the monkeys start with sequence 2. They also start with 2. So, when the last monkey receives a 2, it passes 1, which is the next number in sequence 2. The last number has the sequence 3, passing it down, and the monkeys have a 3. The sequence of the monkey that initially was the first one in the sequence 3, passed to the very last monkey.\nSo the final order of sequence changes to 2,2,4,1,3,5,7,9\n\nInput: Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dan are four best friends planning for summer trip together in a small vacation suite.

A sandal (sometimes known as a \"thong\" or a \"flip-flop\") is a type of shoe that covers all or part of the foot, typically leaving one or more of the toes exposed. Sandals, in this context, can also include shoes with soles that are attached to the foot by means of straps, such as athletic footwear. The word sandal originally meant a type of clog, and this meaning is preserved in that term.  Sandals were worn by both men and women.  The Greek and Roman nobility did not wear sandals. How do sandals and flip-flops differ?\nOutput: A flip-up is an open-toed shoe that can be worn both indoors and outdoors, typically as a more casual, typically summer-time shoe. A sandal is a type of footwear that has a sole that binds to the foot with a thong that clings around the heel or ankles or to a strap between the heel and forepart of the foot, and has a flat sole that binds to it with stitches or glue or any other types. Sandal can describe a type of footweat that only cover the bottom and sides of the foot with an open toed design. Sandals are generally taken off when they cross a defined barrier such as dining area or public bath, while flip-flopping can be a sandal. Sandals are usually worn as a leisure or relaxation item and in places where bare feet are regarded as acceptable. In a sense, sandals cover the feet, but are strapped around, and are therefore considered \"foot-bind", "answer": "E: heat up"}

Two teams play against each other, with each team consisting of 5 members. There's a special rule for all-female teams: if they lose, then the all-male team gets to eat free cake for that week! If there are more all-male or all-female members in a team, then the team gets to keep its gender the next week as well (after it has had the chance to eat free cake!). How can I determine the number of cakes that will be eaten after all the games are finished?\nOutput: After each game, if a team gets more wins, then they get to eat more cakes.  Otherwise, they're going for a walk, which is obviously not as helpful as being able to take a taste of our beloved dessert.\nThere are a couple of important rules about having an all-male or an all-female team:\n* If you choose an all-male team, then they will have to play a total of 13 games (12 games + 1 game of free eat-cake).\n* But if you choose an all-females team, they can play a maximum of 6 games (5 games + 1 game to eat free cake).\nNote that if an all-femal team wins a game, then they will also get to eat free cake, and the next game they will also be able to eat free cake.  This is why if the team is 3-3 going into their final game against an all-male team with a different gender, then they'll need only 2 games as a win on the final game will ensure that they keep their team unchanged for the next round.\nIn both cases, the free cake rule will come into effect if a team loses, and a team should only eat cake if they're not going to play one more game (and still win it).\nSo the question is:  given 5+13+3+2= <<5+13+5", "answer": "C: meeting"}

Farmers pay taxes to the federal government in the form of personal property taxes. The federal government in turn pays salaries to federal bureaucrats who pay for social welfare services that are provided to people in the form of farm subsidies.\n   \t\t Poor countries:  No one pays anything to anyone.  The only realistic way to get the poor out of poverty is to raise the value of their labors so they are able to command a high enough hourly wage that they can start to buy products and services produced by others.  The only way people pay money is to work as a slave and accept less money from the slave owner and/or the slave owner pays more for the same labor.\n   \t\t Plantation: The owner of a plantation is a slave master of his plantation.  In the United States in the year 1860, there was almost 4 million non-slave owners living in the South.  These slaves owned an estimated share of around 44 % of the total value of all the land in the South.  This was the source of the wealth of the South.  These landowners have been able to sell shares of the harvest to the Northern corporations to buy their goods and services.  This money helps to provide a way for them to provide their land for a profit.  In other words, this money would be used to provide a way to pay these Northern companies to send products and services to the Southern plantations in order to raise the value of the slaves labor.

Three of those pennies are fakes. Two bags of pennies are found in the back of a car. Three pennies are found face down in one bag and six pennies are face down in the second bag. If there is at least one penny in a bag that is not a fake and there is less chance of finding a fake in the first bag than the second bag, how many pennies are in the first bag?\nOutput: First: If there is at least 1 penny in a bag, we get 1 bag of pennies, 3 bags of fakes, 1 bag of pence and 2 bags of face down pences\nSecond 1/2 of the pence is found face down, we have to get rid of 1 bag to make them all face up. So 1/2 of 2 bags is 1 bag. To make 2 bags face down of pence we have to get rid 2/3rd of the real pence. So 2/3 of 1 bag of real pence is real pence. So to make 1 bag of face down pence we need get rid of 2/3 of the fake pence. So 1/3 of 3 bags, will get 1 bag of fake.

{"idx": 748, "text": "The children saw superman fly over them, thus their response would be either A or B.\nTherefore, our answer choices are A, B, D, or E.\nLet choice A be the correct option.\nChoice B: Since superman only just flew over the children, it would be impossible for the children to skip in the direction that they were heading. If they were walking towards the window where they saw superman fly, for instance, they would not be able to simply skip back. They will have to walk somewhere where there is room for them or stop running. However, if they were running, at a faster speed, then they may be able to skip a bit but would find it harder. Choices C and D also do not make sense based on what superman does and where they are going.\n\nChoice A: If Superman flew into their yard in front of the children on the ground, the children may have been hurt by superman's sudden change in direction and speed when he was flying but flew back into the sky again. Since they see the man fly into their property and change direction suddenly, they would most likely exclaim the word, \"ugh!\" after seeing the sudden change in direction.\nChoice B: The children do not see superman fly over them but instead notice superman suddenly stop flying. Their reaction is not based on superman flying past them but seeing the sudden change in behavior when superman comes to a halt.\nChoice D: This choice does not really make sense for a variety of reasons. For one, if superman was on television, the children would likely not see superman fly towards their property but instead notice a sudden change in channel. This sudden change may be disruptive to them so they may exclaim, \"ugh!\" or \"ugh!!\" or even, \"Hey!\" due to the shock they will likely experience. For a second reason, they more likely will go to their television or a store to purchase a television or other type of technology so they will watch television.\nChoice E: This choice is an unlikely reaction based on seeing superman fly. Since they are children, they would likely be able to hear superman fly over since he will be closer to their ears. Alternatively, they may have been injured by superman.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is either A or B.

So, they will definitely be buying clothes..\nSo, I think the actual answer is E..\nAnswer 2:\nAnswer for Option A:\nIn a lot of places the cost of food is similar for similar goods. In grocery stores, there are brands that compete with each other on price, for example: generic toys, generic food, etc.\nBut in cinema halls, food is expensive and it's different for different people. It can be expensive because the food is from a famous restaurant. Maybe the cinema hall does not own the food, so it makes more money. Maybe the food costs more because it has to be ordered. It has a lot of labor costs. The food has to be delivered, so there are transportation costs. It has to be kept cool which costs a lot of electricity.\nIf you want food, you can either buy it from a concession stand or you can bring it from home. Because people don't like to walk to the concession stand, the cost of the food in the concession stands is more.\nIf you look at the theater, you can buy chips for $3.00 or you can bring your own and pay one dollar less. Why is $3.00 a better deal than $2.00? Because the person who buys the chips is paying two dollars for the chips. Whereas in the first option you are paying three dollars for the chips and one dollar to the theater.\nMaybe the theater owns the concession stand too. Maybe they pay the staff well. Maybe the food is really expensive. If you eat expensive food at home, you'll pay the price anyway.\nAnswer for Option B:\nClothes at the mall are inexpensive. They", "answer": "B: mall"}

If it is not a weekend day take the previous value and add the time of the car rental price for seven days. If the previous value contains a Saturday or sunday add 1 to our count. We are incrementing the count by 1 for each weekend day so that when we have completed the time will be equal to the days in a week (7). Then all we have to do is take the count value (which is the number of full days) and multiply by 24 to get the total days in our count.

But plants die on each day, and eventually are replaced with new ones. Because new plants are born, and old ones die, the death rate is constantly changing each day - and because each day the death rate changes, the number of plants dead will not stay constant. The equation will need to be modified each day (as in, each new day you will need to recalculate the equation), but it will eventually hit an asymptote - the point at which both the change in plants dead and in plant birth are zero. This is reached when the birth rate (0.5) is equal to the death rate (0.25), and the number of initially dead plants will eventually stay the same after this point. Then if this number of pumpkins dead is 2.25 and the initial amount of plants is 1062, then these values are both.2", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}

He put his fence one foot away from each side. He then wants to fill the space created by the fence, but he can only plant square shaped sections. If the fence is $100$ ft high, how tall can the building be that the farmer can make without using scrap lumber?\nOutput: The farmer is left with an area of $600$ square ft, and he is allowed $4$ square ft of leftover lumber. The building cannot be taller than the fence however, so the height of the building is limited by the length of the fence.\nTherefore, $250 + 600 = 850 / 4 = 212.5$\nThis building is $850$ square ft. Since there is $212.5 = <<212.5=1.125>>1.125 more than $850$ ft of leftovers, the building can be a fraction of $850$ over $850$.\nSo the final answer for the height of the building in ft is 850/1.125= <<850/1,125=0.748>>0.748\n\nInput: You have a rectangular shaped field that is $50 \\mathrm{ft}$ long and $30 \\mathrm{ft wide}$.

What fraction, in lowest terms, represents the proportion of the farm that is not in the shade?\nOutput: Let a, b, c, and d represent the number of fields in the sun/shade respectably.\n5/(4+1)=6\nAnd also 5/(4a+1b+1c+1d)=6\nTherefore, we have (4a+1b) =<<(4a+1b)+1>>6\nAnd (4a+1)-1b=<<(4a+b)+1>>6,b\nAnd we can replace our b by adding 1 to our current b to get (4a+b+1)\nThus 4a+c+d=<<4a+b+2>>6\nThus c =<<(4a-2d)/c>>6-2d because dividing a number by a fraction, 4/c leaves it as an integer which is 4a-2d\nTherefore, 2c+d/c=<<2*(4a-2d+d)/(4a-2)(d-4a)>>6-2d,4a-2d because if we subtract 2*d*d*c,d or 4a-2,d we should get the original 2*2*4a-2*4a-4=-8a which is 8a.\nThus d = 8a\nThus (4a-2d-8d)/c=<<4a-12d+8a/>6-2d,a-16a,4\nAnd this new equation simplifies to 4/c=<<4a/4a-8a+16a=3>>6\nSo c = 3/4\nand thus b = (4a-3c)/c =<<4a-4/4=<b>>>6\nTherefore, the proportion of the fields that are not in the shade are the number of fields in sun as a proportion of the fields that remain is 3/4, which is (4a)/(4a-4b) or in simpler terms,", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

This farm has more cats than any other animal on the farm. What number represents this many cats?\nOutput: The only answer that makes sense is 132 (132 is the exact amount of cats on the farm)\nIn general, if you have a lot of cats for example for a farm or some old person whose cats are all gone. Well, this many cats is 132. So for a farm the best answer is 132 cows because they have more cows than any other animal on their farm, so the answer is 134.\n\nInput: A bus seat costs 65 cents while a train seat costs 45 cents. A taxi seat costs 60 cents. Which is the best deal?\nOutput: A bus 4*65 = <<4*65=260>>260 cents for $20.00\nA train 5*45=<<5*45=225>>225 cents for $17.50.\nA taxi cab 6*60 = <<6*60=360>>360 cents for, I don't know.

There was the father on the driver's seat, the mother in the passenger seat, the boy in the back right, all the girls, on the back left all in their own beds.  It was Sunday morning, the 6th of September, and the family of six was driving all of that way in two cars, neither of which drove under the speed limit on a flat highway.  The entire point was to go on the trip to see the beach but they did end up getting there.  All of the family had been to the beach before, except the father who had been there ten times and only in the summertime.  The mother had been there five times, but it was much colder and it had rained.  The two younger boys had been there four times, the oldest boy only went twice, but it was when he turned seven years old.  The girls had all been there countless times and enjoyed it more than the boys.  They both loved the beach, but were afraid of jellyfish.  They brought some sandwiches and plenty of snacks and drinks.  Everyone was so excited about their trip and got some good pictures of the car in front of the beach, where a lot of fish were being eaten from the nets.  The car that was going to go to the beach was so far ahead of the other car, that it was almost 90 degrees to the car that was in front of it.  They drove down that highway of 14 miles (which was half the trip) in ten minutes, but the person driving got so tired, he fell asleep in the car.  The family was driving along and had to stop at a rest stop.  But he was so tired he forgot he needed to get food or gas. The family woke him up and made him stop and get gas. He asked them 5 times if they were thirsty while the truck was filling up.  The truck was almost full when he asked them 6 times.  They all got some food and then they were back on their way. They were in a hurry to get to the beach because", "answer": "D: skill"}

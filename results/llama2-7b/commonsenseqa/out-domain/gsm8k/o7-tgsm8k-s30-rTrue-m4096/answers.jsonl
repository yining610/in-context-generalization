The ratio of bouquets of blue flowers to bouquets of yellow flowers that Amy and Emily picked was 5:3. How many bouquets did they make?\nOutput: First, Amy picked 20 flowers, and Emily picked 10 flowers, as shown by the illustration.\nSince there are more blue flowers than yellow flowers, this equals 5.\nThen, we need to find how many bouquets both of them made.  The ratio of total bouquets to blue flowers is 3:7, but the ratio of bouquets to blue and yellow flowers (since Emily made 3 and Amy made 0) is 5:8.\nTo solve, we can multiply:\n5x7 = 3x0 + 8x3\n5x7 = x3 + x1 = 33\n\nThe total bouquets is 33 bouquets.\n\nInput:  How many apples does each person get if 8 people share 4 apples equally?\nOutput: Since we have 8 people (a group), and 4 apples, we can find the answer by dividing 8 by 4.

What proportion of students took either both AP English and AP Math, or German but not music?\nOutput: If there are 1/3 who took English, there are 2/3 who did not take English.\nIf there are 1/8 who took Math then there were 6/8 - 2/8, and so 4/8 took Math.  Similarly, if 1/5 also took music then 4/5 did not take music.  1/6 is less than 5/8 because  2/3 * 2/4 < 5/8.  This means that 5/8 of the rest did not take music.  That leaves 2/3 of the remaining 3/8 of the class who did not take music or german.

This, though, gives us the wrong number of cassettes. This is because we need to multiply our result by the number of books we get.

This is a symbol. It is the division symbol.  When we divide fractions, we always try to write an equation, and we use the multiplication symbol to indicate what is the inverse of division, and it\u2019s multiplication.   We will look at some typical scenarios where you will want to do division and write down an equation.  So in these cases you will always start off by dividing  by  and  and  by an object, and then write a division statement that says,  so we\u2019re going to look at a few examples here.  Let\u2019s first look at the scenario where a problem says, 6 divided by  4.  Let me show you.\n\nInput: In the figure, the red triangle is a right isosceles triangle.

We can say that it took 140 days for all the seed to produce carrots.  Since each carrot was equal to another carrot, we can say that each farmer grew the same amount of car", "answer": "B: respond"}

How many fences were there and how many times did the dog and rabbit swap directions?\nOutput: A dog was chaseing a rabbit.  At every fence the rabbit turned right and the dog turned left.

When the rabbits reach the fence it was turned left and the dogs was turned right meaning it was a switch.  so when the rabbit was 2 fences away from the dog it would switch back to turn right when the dog was 2 fences ahead of it.  Then the rabbit was 4 fences away from the dogs 2 fence ahead and it was not until the rabbit was 1 fence away from the dogs 1 fence in front did the rabbit switch, and the dog switched on the same fence just as before.  So when the rabbit was at 1 fence away it would swap back and the dogs would swap in.

She ate all of the candied apples and 5 of the 12 ounces bags of popcorm. How many ounces of popcorn was left in the bag?\nOutput: We start with Aaron paying 40$. First we have 3.99 + 39.99 because she bought a bag of apples and 9 bags because she ate 5. We then have to subtract that for the remaining bag since she also ate 5. The apples are 17.00 and the popcorm is 2.98. That means she bought the popcorn for 19.98 and bought her apples free of charge. We then have 17.02 + 19.92 to find the total dollars spent. Which we then can subtract from the total for the popcorn to find how many ounces were left\nThe answer is 11. In her bag of pop corn there was 54 oz for each bag and she ate 5 12 oz bags. This leaves 9 bags and 5 oz each left in her bag of pop corn. For the apples which she ate there was 12 oz in each package. This leaves 5 apples or 60 oz in each bag.", "answer": "A: suicide"}

The new cost of the car including the state tax was $9000.\nThe new car depreciated by $1800 immediately after purchasing it.  John decided to sell the car after 3 years. The selling price of his car was $4000.\nWhat was the total depreciation he had incurred in dollars?\n\nOutput: The 1st year (1 year is 12 months):\nWe know from the questions provided that the new car was paid $900 in dollars during the 1st year.\n\nSo 1st year + Tax = (9000/12)*0+650 \n1st year + Tax + Depreciation = (900+650+1800) \nSo the first year is $9000, which is $900, 650 for taxes, and then 1800 for depreciation.\n\nSecond year (2 years are 24 months):\nYear 1 + Tax + Depreciaition = Year 2\nThe 2nd year (after the depreciation was done from the 1st year) still costs about $6000 because we are not done with the taxes and depreciation.\nThe 2nd Year tax + Depreciation was $6000. \nSo we need to add Tax and Depreciaion together again:\n1st year + 2nd year Tax + 2nd year Depreciaion = Year 2\nYear 2 tax: 1.5 year * $650 = $975\nYear 2 depreciation: 1.5 years * $1800 = $2700\nYear 2 Total: $975 + $2700 + $6000 = $9700\n\nThen there is a bit of a problem.

He\u2019s only got one tool, a hand-held hoe. The hoe has a width of 2 feet, but its blade is only 6 inches wide. How many trips is he going to have to take to do the entire job?\nOutput: The question is \u201cHow many trips is he using?\u201d  The answer is just 1, because a single square requires four separate trips.\nFirst, he moves to the NorthWest angle (2) to move West(2) to his 13th position.\nThen, he walks West(2) to the NorthWest angle.\nThen, he moves NorthWest(2) to his final position.\nThen, if you want to make the same cycle, just reverse it.  He moves NorthWest(2-1) to his final position and then moves South(-2) and walks South(-1) to position 10.\nTo get to the middle, he can make 2 separate movements, either SouthWest(2) or SouthWest(2-1), to his 5th position.\nHe will make 4 trips total: The North-South diagonals and the East-West ones.\nBecause a full square requires 18 trips, you know that you need to repeat the cycle of four trips to reach that result.  He is required to make the same cycle of movements four times (four complete trips) to do this square.\nSo, we can conclude that he must make exactly 4 trips.\nIf you find this confusing, I do agree.  This problem can be very confusing at first.\nIf it helps at all, consider the square from a different point of view - the \"row\" view instead of the \"table view.\"  Think of the 35 foot grid as a \"row of squares.\"  Each \"square\" equals one foot.\nNow, what I mean by that is, if he is walking North-South on the diagonal of the square, he will reach the NorthWest angle in 1 square (2 foot distance).

She received 27 weeks of unemployment benefits and her benefits were worth $400 per week.  If we have $5500 in a checking account, what is the total income Tina receives each year?\nOutput: The unemployment benefits were worth $4,000.  The income from her checking account was worth $5500 and when you subtract $4,00 from $5500 you obtain $5,000. The total income Tina receives is $5500+5000-4000=<<5500+4000-4,000=5000>>5000 for the year. \nSo the final answer to the question is 5,000\n\nInput : Tina works 20 hours a week.

{"idx": 164, "text": "The question didn't mention if the length were feet, miles, cm, or anything other than \"yard.\"  Since yards is a common unit for measurement in the U.S., then we'll assume that the question meant yards.  Bob's feet hurt so it was likely that he was running fairly fast.  Thus, to calculate an approximate distance Bob ran, we'll use calculus's definition of acceleration: the rate of change in velocity.  Since Bob knew where he started, the distance he ended up running equals: distance traveled + acceleration * time taken (where the rate of change in time is assumed to be small so we can approximate the acceleration over the course of the entire trip) = d.  So an approximate number of yards Bob ran if he ran from the corner store to home and his feet hurt from the pounding, we use the equation d = \u00bdat^2.  We only need to know the initial acceleration and distance Bob traveled, so we'll use those to plug into our velocity equation, v = at.  A(v)/2(a) = v^2.  But we know that to solve for at and plug it into our velocity equation we need to solve for v^2.  Therefore, at2 = v^2.  60 miles per hour * 24 inches/hours = 60 in/per hour = 6in/s.  In miles per hour, 6in/s * (5280/1 mile) = 33,600 in/mile.  So the 60 miles per hr. of Bob's travel speed was 33,680, meaning that the length of inches of the 60 mph run was 33,700 inches.  Now, 33,760 / 2 = 13,880, which is an average velocity of 1.588 mph.  As an estimate, we can say that the distance traveled was 10,000 (~10), and the average velocity was 1.6 mph.  Using our original formula we get: d = (.5)(1.6)(10000^2) = 38400.\nNote that Bob is walking in \"painful\" shoes, so we can assume that Bob", "answer": "D: city block"}

The coordinates of the triangle\u2019s vertices are (4, 0), (0, 4), and (7, 7). The area of a triangle is half of the product of two sides.   Since 4 and 7 are opposites, you can ignore the vertex coordinates and simply treat all three points as (4, 7), the midpoint. The sides are (4, 4), (4, 7) and (7, 4).    The area of a triangle with sides (4, 4) and (7,7) is 33/2 square units.\nThe two triangles are congruent, so you can double the area: 33/2*2 = 66/4. This is the equation for the area of a triangle.\n66-1/4 is the area of a single triangle, so there are (1/2) (66-1/1) = 52 triangles.\nIf the given triangle is a scalene triangle (all sides are different lengths), then use the area formula again with lengths (4, 7, 4) and multiply:  2*(33/2)(26/4) = 261.\nIf the given triangles are equil", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

{"idx": 297, "text": "Floors are kept clean for holy purposes at a synagogue, as evidenced by the answer choice D.  Finding out what floors are kept clean for the purposes of praying requires the application of the mathematical process of elimination, an important skill for problem solving.  Answer choices A and B:  We know from the context of the question that floors cannot be kept clean for holy purposes in either restaurants or basements.  This is because both places have either floor tile or wood floors, neither of which can be cleanly swept.  Choices C and E: It is not obvious that basements have carpets, let alone the kind of religious carpets used by Jews for praying.  Therefore, synagogues would be the only places where floors are kept clean to facilitate holy pursuits.  Choice D does not explicitly say that carpets are used for holy floors, or mention any specific type of carpet at all.  This means that the answer to the question does not include a specific type of carpet floor, but floors that are kept clean in this manner.\nSo the final answers is C\n\nInput: What is the length of the side of the square?

Python and Java can't be used interchangeably for the unit tests (it can't be written in Python first). \n\nIt is very time consuming writing the same code in two different programming languages, testing, and rewriting. \n\nThe project's unit tests consisted of writing the same code in both Java and Python and then comparing the results. \n\nI noticed that the Python unit tests took at least 3x as long", "answer": "C: lark"}

If every fourth orange will fall to the ground and each orange weighs 1 pound, what is the weight of all the oranges?\nOutput:\nThe fruit stand was 5.5 feet in radius.  There are 3 pi r=<<3pi*r=60>>60 fruits on the tree.  If the tree is full then there are also 60 fruits directly above the tree and 60 fruits to the right of the tree and 67 fruits above and the right of the tree.  There are 60+60+67 =<<60+60-67>>67 fruits above the tree and  to the right of the\ntree.  If the tree holds no fruits directly above the apple then there must be 60 below the leftmost apple.  There are 4 below the apple at the center then to the left of the center there must be 54 fruits.  This equals five columns of 60 fruits each and five columns of 54 fruits each. The total weight of all the fruits is 5*60 =<<5*60=300>>30\n0 pounds each column totals 280 pounds of fruits.  50 plus 280 equals 330 pounds.  All the fruits weigh 330 pounds and 330 pounds+4=<<330+4=334>>334\nSo the final answer 334 pounds\n\nInput:  A family has 8 children and gives 3 cans of soup to each of their four brothers and sisters.

However, if you buy more than one new set, you can get a discount. Each new set is cheaper, but if you buy more than 3, the price stays the same and the total cost just goes up instead.\nIf you choose the least expensive option, all you have to do is pay for 3 new shocks -- which together would cost $600 -- and you're all set.\nNew Shocks:\nIf you buy only one, it costs $200\nIf you buy 2, they cost $210\nIf you buy from 3 to 9, they cost $220\nIf you buy any more than 9: they stay the same no matter how many you buy\nFor all other quantities of shocks, we have to get all three of the options between them and go with the lowest.

On average, each student reads for 15 minutes each day. On Friday\u2019s the class comes to see a movie.  If on Monday there are 30 pages in the textbook, by how many pages has the class fallen behind?\nOutput: In a week, there are seven days. That means that there are 210 pages in the text book in the span of time that there are twentyfour hours, times seven days. That means there is an average of 210/24, or 9 pages read per day by each student. The three hundredths for each day to read is added, and you have 9.25 pages read per day. Monday is one page in, so 25 (the number of students) times 9.25 (the amount of textbook pages read per day on average), is 232 and a half pages, which is the number of pages that is read in the span of five days. The next Friday, is the end of the week, and in that day the students read 50 pages because you added five days to Monday and 232. 5 equals 37, which is the remainder of the total number of pages that the students have read in five days. So to find the number of pages that have not been  read in the school week, simply subtract the remainder from the initial value which is 162.5 (remainder) and 210 (initial number of pages), and you have 47.5, which is the total number of pages unread in the span of five school days.  So, in order to find by how many pages have they fallen behind, you subtract 47.5 from 210, which is eighty-seven and a half pages.

Here it is.\n\n40 boxes = 30 books in each box = 1200 books\n\nSince the painting weighs 700, the total weight is 12700, since we need to fit 12000 pounds in the other two rooms\n\n12700/30 = 423 books in one box\n\n(5000-1200)= 3800 pounds left over\n\n3800/423= 0.9 books from 5000 to 423\n\n5000-0.9 = 4991 pounds need to be moved\n\nSince the box can\u2019t hold more than 25 pounds at a time.\n\n4991/25 = 199 boxes\n\nSince the total number of boxes is 40, then 199/40= 0.5 boxes is left unused\n\nSo the answer for this is 199", "answer": "C: clothing store"}

John lives in Chicago, 4 hours away from Des Moines and 3 hours from Omaha.  His wife lives in Des Moines, 3 hours from Onawa and 2 hours from Chicago.  If both John and his wife are at their homes in the mornings, how many hours do they travel, in total, to get from their homes to each others\u2019 homes?\nOutput: There is the way to get to Des Moines and then the way to get to Omaha or Onawa all together because that\u2019s the only way to get there. So you go to Des Moines, which is 3 hours from Oinawa then from their home to where they are going to work which is 4 hours from Chicago. So after they are done with their work and going to home they would spend 4 hours to get to Chicago which would be another 3 hours of total driving time to get to John. And the same thing as his wife is going to their house and from that point to work they only have 3 hours to get to Chicago so they have to spend 1 more hour of driving. When they add the numbers up it will come out to 30 hours of total driving time.\nSo in total this question can be solved using this equation. 1500/6=<<1500/15>>15\n2*1500/2=<<2*150/15>>262.5\n3*15000/3=<<3*150/3>> 50\n4*1500*/4=<<4*15*/4>>625\n5*1500.0/5=<<5*150.0/5>>300.\nThis question is answered with the sum of 262.5 + 50 + 625 + 300 = <<262.5+50+625+300=627.5>>627.5\nSo the final answer here", "answer": "C: state of union"}

For each invitation, he had to choose to attend, not attend, or respond with a question asking the host if he would please invite his brother.  If John responds in any other way, he will not make the list.  How many ways can he choose?\nOutput: Let the number of ways be 2m-1.\nHere, each invitation is a m choice.\nThe number of invitations multiplied by the choice of either attending the party or having the host invite his brother is\n57(2m-1) = 57 * (2m-1) - 57 = 57 + 57(2m - 1) - 51m = 57(2k-1)\nThe number of ways of choosing k is\n2k\nTo choose the number of invitations, pick an integer k. The possible values are k = 0 to 56, as 57 = 2m-1\nSo, for each invitation, we can pick from 0 to 57 possible choices, and the answer to this problem will be 2 * 57 - (0 + 1 + 2 +.. + 56) = 2\nThe final answer is 2.\n\nInput: A farmer has a field with a surface area represented by 35y=16x.

This game is more difficult and has a lower probability of winning when the team is ahead by three points or more than when they are even or behind.  Given that the team in the lead has the odds of making errors decrease faster than the losing team, but that both teams can make errors at any time, how likely is it that the team which started with the lead in the game of volleyball will win in two more sets?\nOutput:The given response is actually incomplete.  There are times you find a 3 point lead and win out in two straight sets, but there is also a time in which you find yourself with a 3 point lead, get ahead but the other team catches up and wins in five sets.  That said you will find yourself in situations where a 3 point lead is almost certain and those situations where there is barely any chance a team having the lead will take four straight sets.  In situations where the lead is barely holding the 3 point margin, the game can turn around within 2 turns.\nIn such a game given a 3 point lead; the team trailing has a 60%, 80% and 90%; chance each turn with one set.  While the team having the lead has a 60% chance in the first turn, a 40% chance in the second turn and a 20% chance in the third turn.  If the team in the lead makes no mistakes in such a game but the team trailing makes only one mistake.  Then the team in the lead wins the game 100% of the time.

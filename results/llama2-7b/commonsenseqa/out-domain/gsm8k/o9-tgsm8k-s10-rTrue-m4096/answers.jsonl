All wrapping paper rolls cost $17.99. As he is waiting for his money to be counted, he realizes he needs some ribbon. He thinks about buying some ribbon to go with his wrapping paper. Each ribbon is $15.94. He is considering buying 6 rolls. What is the total cost to buy these items?\nOutput:First we will calculate the answer for the wrapping paper\n\nSo 38 rolls x 17.99 = <<38*17.99=694.62>>694.6\nAfter wrapping, he has to buy ribbons to go with his wrapping.\nBut if he bought 6 rolls, it would cost him $$<<15.99*6=95.94>>95.94\nSo the final answer for wrapping is 694.6 + 95.94 = $<<694.6+95.94=1640.56>>1640.6\nSo the final answer 1640 for wrapping\n\nInput:A car rental will cost $85", "answer": "A: ignore"}

A local bus transport company that runs the service has a cost-per-mile ratio of 5 dollars. What is the cost of running the bus for 600 miles?\nOutput: The bus company has a cost-per mile ratio of 5 dollars, so the cost of running the service for 600 mile is $<<600*5=3000>>30,000.\nSo the bus costs $30,00 for 600 hundred miles.\nThe total cost of running the bus service is $1,000,000/1,000 = <<1000,0/1000=1>>1.\nSince the cost of running bus service is $1.6, the total cost of running a bus for 60 miles are $<<1.6*60=96>>96.\nSo the bus runs for 3,000 miles for $96 in total $<<16+96=112>>112.\nSo the final answers are 1,12,96\n\nInput: How long does the 18-day period of Eve and the second 17-day period of Asher total?\nOutput: Let's just ignore the second day of the week (since that starts right away with Asher, 1+366+365 = <<1+366//365<<=366/365>>6.8).\nWe now have 18 days in a row and then a second 17-days in a row, both of which are each 366 days long.\nThose two periods come out to 14 times 17 days or 251 days worth of time.\n\nNow, if the Eve and the Asher periods each consist of 256 days (366 days from Sunday to Saturday), we get 2*256 = <<2*256=512>>\nSo the final answer will be 6.8 + 512 = <<6.8+512=512>>512 days.", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

Which has faster speeds, DSL or cable?\nOutput: You might consider your needs first. DSL and cable networks both provide high-speed Internet access, but they differ in coverage and cost. A DSL\nis connected to the local telephone company's network, and provides speeds of up to 6Mbps. A cable connection is run through the cable company's network, which provides speeds of up\nto 25Mbps. If you live in a house, which has multiple rooms in which to connect computers, DSL would be more cost effective. A DSL installation is less expensive than a\ncable connection.\nSome people are concerned about the technology used in a DSL connection. The equipment installed to transmit data over a DSL service is powered by electricity, and many\nconsumers fear that the electricity could possibly cause complications with their phones, or even be hazardous to their health.\nThe DSL Internet connection is safe. The equipment that transmits the data is shielded from the electricity, and they do not transmit any electromagnetic waves that might prove\nharmful to the user. DSL connections are safe for use around a phone as long as the phone service is not interrupted. Cable Internet connections use cable television channels\nas the transmission method, so there's no special concern from electrical devices, but those with radio interference problems should consider DSL.\n\nInput: Which of the following could be used to share a file with someone else?

So, the change in the price of ground beef will be 500%, so one has to multiply the fixed value.\nIn our example, Year ago = $/500 =.25\nThe present price = new price = 1.25\nIn order to determine the change, one has to use the formula that change = Present value - (Fixed value)\nPresent price =.25 * 1.25 =.3125\nTo determine the change between the old and the new prices, one has to subtract the old price from the new one. So, the change will be.3125 -.25 =.0625 cents.\nSo, the final answer is.0625\n\nInput: Alice earns $12 an hour.

You've found 1/5, 1/10 and 1/4 of the berries in the forest. How many more berries must you check to be sure you've found all the berries in the area?\n\nOutput:From the given information, we can say that the total no. of blueberries in the forest are 1/5,1/10 and1/4.Hence, total no. of blueberry = (1/5 +1/10 +1/4) =5/20\nIt can also be written as the simple fraction 2/10\nFrom the given information, the total number of blueberries = 2/10.\nAfter that, if there are more berries to check, the total number of berries remains the same. Hence total no. of berries = 2/20 +2/20 =4/20.\nSince the total number of berrys are two units to the 20th power, the total remaining blueberries must also be in the 20th or 21st power in order to balance the equation.\n\nTo be thorough check the entire area will take (5/20)*20 = 25 checks\nSo to be sure you'd have to check (5", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

How many miles per hour should it travel to cover 120 miles?\nOutput: The number of miles covered by the car each hour is 40(1 / mth).  Where mth is the mileage from the car to the top of the gas tank, so mth = 120\nSo, if we want to cover 60 miles we must drive 40(1/120(hours/mile))( hours/mile)(distance covered by the car in each hour).\nSo, if we substitute the formula in to the previous equation that the car can cover 60 miles in each hour we should cover 120/60(7.5) = 12.5\nSo, we would drive 40(mth / hour) = 40(120 / 60(1/7.5) hours/mile)(60/40)*60, which equals 4 hours and 40 minutes.\nSo, in total it takes the car 4 hours and 50 minutes to cover 12 miles.\nSo, the answer is option C.\n\nInput: If Jaxen, 19, and Nina, 23, go hiking together, what percent of the hikers is Nina?\nOutput: To find out the number of women in total we simply divide the number of men by 2, because there is one man and one woman in total, 50% of people are women and the rest are men.

They can buy 70 percent of the rice they should get for free.  What is the maximum number of bags of flour they can buy with their savings from rice?\nOutput:  A family can buy 95 pounds of total rice every month.\n70 percent of this is 70*95 = <<70*95=66>>66.\nThen total rice bought is 66+$<<66+20>>20  or $86.\nThey use rice for 70+20 = <<70+20=90>>90% of their budget.\nAs they buy more than the 66 pounds of rice, they will use it up slowly, so they can buy less rice and flour.\nThey can buy 66 pounds of flour.\nSo 66", "answer": "D: math problem"}

Each product, apart from the price, has various attributes like its design, size, color, number of storage locations it takes up, features, quality etc.  The price depends on a) price of the product b) number of various attributes, c) which attributes\nOutput: For the example below, the store has two products, A and B.\nThe store knows the price and attributes for each product.\n- The price of Product A is $140.  It takes 10 storage locations, and has 10 features and 10 of a particular quality.\n- Likewise, the price of Product B is $260. It takes 15 storage locations, and has many features and 5 of a similar quality.\nTherefore, the price per attribute would be $140/$260 = <<140$260=0.55>>0.55\n\nFor Product A, it has 10 features, but only 10 of a certain quality. Hence, the cost of those features is $140 / 10.\nAdditionally, Product A has 10 design options and takes 10 storage spaces. Hence, the price of attributes for Product A would be:\n 10 design options * 0.55 = <<10*0.55=5.5>>5.5\nAdditionally, Product B has 5 features and 5 of that quality.  It also has 5 design options  and takes 15 storage spaces.\nHence the price per attribute, for Product B is:\n 5 feature options * 0.6 = <<5*0.6=3>>3\nFor Product B, the price of attribute would be (5 features * 0.6) + (5 design options *0.55 ) and the price of an attribute for Product B per Product B would be 3 + 2.8 = <<3+2.8=5.8>>5.8", "answer": "D: fairgrounds"}

This is a function because f\n         (t) is dependent on the variable t. Let t be the hours of each day. Since f(\n      t) is a function of time, it only makes sense to ask for the volume of spilled water starting at time t=0.  This is because starting at time\n        t=0, a positive (increasing) rate of flow f(t) only makes the volume of water increase.\n\nFor an  average rate increase of 25%, we can approximate f(t) as", "answer": "B: woods"}

He is currently running for president of the US. \nIn the summer of 1984, the Vietnam War officially came to an end. The last US military personnel in Vietnam were evacuated in 1995.

{"idx": 389, "text": "People who read a lot of books (like librarians) are also likely to read many magazines. Thus, a more likely place for many people to have their magazines is the bookstore, even if they don\u2019t keep them there.\nThe magazine is primarily read while at the doctor, but the patient isn\u2019t the person who brings it, so it\u2019s more likely to be read at home.\nMost people don\u2019t keep an overabundance of magazines in their home. They\u2019re more likely to have a small (and outdated) pile there. But they\u2019re more likely to keep their library at home so the library answer is most likely to be wrong as it\u2019s so uncommon as to rule it out as a reasonable choice.\nHome:  People are at home reading magazines. If you bring magazines to your home, you probably mean to read them at home.\nTable: People use magazines as an adjunct to reading online. You could potentially read a magazine at a table somewhere else, but the people who have extra table space typically are going to read elsewhere.\nDoctor: The doctor probably isn\u2019t reading the magazine he/she keeps - it\u2019s a magazine he/she brought for the patient. The doctor is reading the magazine to help the patient. In such cases, the patient may also have a home copy of the magazine, and is quite likely to have a copy in the bookstore.\nBookstore: The bookstore is more likely for \u201cfrequent readers\u201d to have a lot of magazines, and even less likely for them to have magazines in-store. Magazines are also probably not that important in people\u2019s life to justify keeping them at the library and even less likely at the home.\nThe doctor would read a magazine at the doctor\u2019s office.\nPeople visit doctor\u2019s offices for short-term reasons. In the case of a long-term ailment, people would typically keep a doctor\u2019s office appt with their doctor and they would not likely choose to keep magazines there.\nIf people like to read a lot of books, they\u2019re likely to like to read a lot more magazines, hence it\u2019s not likely to choose bookstore as their choice for keeping magazines.\nOut of all these choices, the answer is doctor.

He reads a total of 112 pages for homework. Additionally, he reads for 515 minutes for fun. How many hours did he read during this time period?\nOutput: To find the total hours he read, we first use the formula for converting a time to hours (minutes/60) to turn the total minutes he read (515 minutes) into total hours (8.55 hours). After this, we multiply the time he read for class (112 minutes) by the time he read for fun (8.55 total hours) to find the hours Tyson read for class. So the total hours he read for both class and fun was 8.55 x 112 = <<112*8.55=949>>949 minutes (or approximately 15.7 hours).\nSo the total answer is 15.7\n\nInput: There are three times more fruit flies per cubic meter in a pineapple than there are in pears.

One day, she had 36 pens and 12 markers. Four days later, Mary had 95 books and 40 pencils, and 79 pens and 13 markers. When did Mary buy 7 notebooks, each with 128 blank pages?\nOutput: Mary bought 7 of the notebooks on the second day. That\u2019s the same day she bought 2 notebooks. She bought 7 additional notebooks on the fourth day.\nSince Mary bought 7 notebooks that were each with 1240 pages, we can say she bought 8 notebooks on the third day.\nWe can use our previous solution to fill in any information that wasn\u2019t given to us.\nSince 8 notebooks (480 * 480 / 256) * 8, let's also multiply by 8.

In context, John was stuck indoors of his house and he couldn't get out because of the fire.\nB)  John's belongings were still in his house.  In context, he was stuck indoors and didn't have any way out.\nC) John was caught in a winter storm.  Since we know that John can't get out of his house, we can determine the weather was a storm and not something that prevented him from getting out.\nD)  The door of his house faced south.  It was stated that John was stuck.  How can we tell that John was stuck?\nE)  Someone set John's house on fire.  In context, the statement that John is being asked was 'why he was stuck?'  So we can determine that it was another person who set the house on fire as opposed to being stressed out of being stuck.\nSo with all these factors in mind, if we were to choose B, he isn't stuck because of his belongings.  That leaves choices A, C, and D.  So B and D are both right and wrong because they don't state that John is stuck.  So B is the incorrect choice and D is the correct choice.\nSo the final answers will be 'Why might he be stuck?'\n\nInput:The bus is travelling at 50% of the speed of the freeway.

Where do they fly into at the bigger airport?\nOutput: They fly into the airport at an angle in the same direction as their original flight (either left to right or right to left).\nWe can tell that they don't land in the exact same direction they flew in from since the plane's total distance flown is not the same distance flown along its route.\nIf we are trying to land where we started, we would have to land on the opposite side of the plane's starting point.\nWe can also tell that the plane's original flight direction is not the same direction at which it is currently flying because they flew directly past the location at which they initially started.\nSo the final direction of the plane is to the left as it flies north for an additional 1 hour.\nSo the final answers is 1\n\nInput: John works at the grocery store.

If you keep the car for 3 years, you would like to sell it for a $2000 gain. The new car you want is $25,000. What payment would you have to make to purchase it?\nOutput: The discount will lower your new car cost by $100, leaving a balance of $25000 - $100 = $24900.\nYou want to pay a payment of $250/month and so you need to borrow $2490/12 = <<2490/48=50>>50 times your monthly payment for a total loan amount of $250 x 50 = <<2000>>10,000.\nSo the loan amount on the new car is $10,00.\n\nTo figure out your monthly payments, simply divide the loan amount by the number of months payments.\nPayments = Loan amount / months of payments = $10000/60=$<<10000.75=181.75>>182\nSo the final answer for the car is $181.76.\n\nInput: For every 35 feet of steel cable, you need one turnbuckle, which you can buy for $130.

This car will operate on 100% ethanol, is zero-emission, and runs on electricity. This car will be able to do 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds. How much ethanol would it take to power this car for 200 miles, given in the equation 2/3 * X * Y = Z, assuming an efficiency of X, with Y the average weight of a gallon of ethanol. The car is expected to operate at 25% of its maximum range capacity for 3 years, and then will use 3 gal of ethanol each day to run.\nOutput: (4000/3)/(3*7 7-2) = 1.667. This will give you the answer of 1.6669 gallons for a 200-mile range.\nThe 3 years of operation is roughly 1095 days.\nSo 1095 * 3, using the percentage of a gallon of fuel that an E85 car requires, gives us 0.0287849 gallon for a day.\nRounding to 3 gallons gives you the daily car run time.\nSo the final average time per gallon for the car to travel is 1.66 * 3 = <<1.66*3=5>>5.\nThis is equal to 5 gallons of fuel per day.\nWe are now using the 2 gallons of fuel per mile in a E85 car.\nSo a 200 mile trip should use 200 miles/2 gallons/mile + gas = <<5>>5.\nWe are now assuming that this will be for the average 3 years of operation at 3", "answer": "C: breaks to help stop"}

The only way to get Tony to the city from his home in the country was to take a bus.  How many tickets would Tony buy?\nOutput:  The total loss was 480, which is a multiple of 48.

Some programming languages permit the use of negative indexes as well.  What is the negative-indexed equivalent to '0-indexing' in C?\nOutput: You get negative index by adding -1, or, subtracting one from the indexing position in the array. For example, in an array initialized with '0' to '9', '-2' would give you '2'. However, in C, this doesn't work because an array indexed with '-1' in C results in an index out of bounds. Hence, to get the negative-indexed version of '0-indexed' for an array size of '0' to 'n', you would have subtract n-1 from the index.\n0-indexed: 0-9,\nNegative-indexed: -1-n-1 => (-1+ (-n-1)) => -n-2\nTherefore, in a 0-9 array, the negative-indexed array would not use arrays, but rather it would be numbers. So, you can just use the negative-index as '9' in the code. This makes the negative-index as the second to last element when '9' is used as the positive-index. \n\nInput: A large company of many departments has the following structure:\n\n* The CEO (of the company)\n* Head of the Accounting Department (which is accountable to the CEO)\n* Head of Sales Department (which is accountible to the CEO) <----- this is the one you need to figure out\n* Head of the IT Department (which is accountble to the CEO)<-----also this one\nInput: The Head of the IT department works directly for the CEO.", "answer": "E: might dream"}

If you want to change the world the first thing you need to change is yourself\n\nThere is an old saying: \"the man/woman on street is the leader of the future\". If enough people make changes and do so together, there is no stopping the change.\n\nSocial activism takes many forms, but again, if not enough people are involved, it loses its effectiveness.\n\nIf everyone starts their revolution from the inside, then outside changes are assured. But in reality, that does not work. If you really want to make a society change, you need to make it in as many ways as possible (for the sake of argument, let's think of that as the outside), for example through education, social/economic equality, etc.\n\nSo only one answer can be correct.

Hence, option B is the right one.\nIf it's followed by \"i,\" then an indication to a county fair can be obtained and hence, option C is the right one. \nIf it's the word followed by the word \"s\" the word \"home\" can be assumed. And if by \"east\", \"n\" can also be assumed to end up together with the speaker to Texas. So,options A and D are possible options.\nSince A is not an option, let's eliminate A and we can conclude that only two options are left out by now. If there are two options left from here, we eliminate the one that is further away from the speaker. Therefore, option C and option D are left. Next, we use the second clue in the sentence to eliminate any other option. Let's put it this way, options C and D may have the same distance from speaker, but option D does not have farm and the word \"home\" from its first part. There's nothing like \"farm\" in option B and the same holds good for option A.

Each store sells books for $4.75. Every day they visit one store and they go to the other store five days later. If Rick and Morty need to go to a minimum of 16 separate events to get both books, what day of the month do Rick and Morty arrive home with both books?\nOutput: The month they first arrive home with both books is March. Why? Suppose Rick and Morty have just had a comic book day and they are back at their home. If they had a comic book on that day, they bought from one store, and can only buy a book from the store they bought from previously, then they can buy a book from the other store on day 25.\nHowever, before that, the number of days between two days when they buy from a different store was even, so they can't buy a book from the same store on the next day. We can prove that if the number of days between any two consecutive days they bought from a different store was odd, then they can buy from the same store on that day.\nSo on March we have 24 stores. Either on March 25th their first encounter with both bookstores was evenly-spaced (so they could buy from both), or it was oddly-spaced. If it was evenly-spatcned, then their second encounter could be the next day, so that counts as two.\nIf it was oddly-space, then the second encounter would have occured within the interval (March 23, March 31). Now let's add the days when they bought from the same store and only the even numbers. We get ((March 24, March 25, March", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

Expressing yourself means expressing your artistic talent if sewing, singing and dancing, writing, and so forth.\nThis means that only express yourself option will make sense.\nSo the final choice is C.\nWe can say that sewers earn and make money by sewing.\nBut this can not be considered an option since you dont see many people sewing as a job.\nYou can make art or express but you do not get many jobs by just showing your talent.\nDance and sing can be seen as a art which people expresses their talent.\nWriting is a option to express but earning is rare.\nSo the final option which suits our answer is C which is to Express yourself.\n\nInput: Two taps faucet a water main.

Therefore, we know from this information that we need to smile back. So that means Choice D is the answer.\nSo the answer can be excluded from the other choices.  Therefore, the answer is D.\nInput:  Two friends were going down the street. The first had $200 more than the second. If the first gave the second $10 and then the two were again $100 apart, who had the most money?\nOutput:  The answer could be any number. Since we know that the first one had $200, it could be either $210 or $230.\nWhenever one person pays the other $5, they are $50 apart at the end, so the first one must either pay the second one another $60 or $150.\nIf the first one had $150, the second one had $230, so the first one would give the second one $50, bringing the second one's total down to $230. So since $230-50= $180 the first person gave the second person $180.\nAfter the first person gave the other person $180, the first person is $200 over the second, so when the second one gives them $10, the first person will owe the second $190.\nHence, the correct answer is B.\nInput:  You have 6 candy in a bag.

{"idx": 913, "text": "The correct answer is C\nFossil fuels like coal, oil and gas are the main sources of energy for human beings, but they produce greenhouse gases that are a major cause of climate change.  More sustainable, clean energy alternatives need to be used to help power electricity-guzzling devices like air conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines.  Wind, solar and hydropower are three renewable energy sources that are already in wide use.  However, because they have lower energy densities than fossil fuels, they are generally seen as inferior alternatives to these polluting fuels and do not account for the bulk of our energy.  That is because it's still a lot more expensive to build hydroelectric dams, wind turbines and solar panels than it is to dig up and refine oil and coal.\nFarms that grow food to be turned into biogas have proliferated alongside the many plants that use these fuels to make electricity to run their operations.  Huge landfills fill with household waste, and the bacteria there digest this organic rubbish and turn it into methane that can be used for fuel.  In some instances, the resulting biogas is used to turn electricity-generating turbines, but in other communities, it is simply burned to create heat or for cooking.\nMore efficient engines are also helping us get more energy from the same amount of fuel, as are electric motors, which are more fuel-efficient than gasoline- and diesel-powered ones.  Some cars can run for 10 to 20 miles on a single charge of electricity.  This is possible because an electric motor is more efficient than a gasoline engine, and also because of technologies that allow for hybrid electric vehicles to run on both electricity and fuel.  Many people, whether they're farmers or urbanites, don't think of plants as an energy source, and even when they do, they think of vegetables as food.  But these green energy makers can be used for many purposes.  Methane digesters take organic detritus like food scraps, dairy products, manure and other waste products and turn them into biogas that can be used for cooking.

If 30% of the customers waited for 30 minutes before they checked out, what percentage waited less or the same amount of time?\nOutput: Let p be the amount of time it took to check out\nIf it took 2 hours to get in front of the checkout line\nthen there was a line of 23 people\nThe number of people in line  that were in front of me are given by p - 23 / 23\nFor the first question, I want the people in line who have wait the same time as me.\nHence I take the intersection of p - 23 \u2229 {(p-p)/23} = p-p/23\nNext, lets say m people in line waited less than me for checkouts\nAnd n people waited for the same time as me\nm+n = 23\nIf m is less than n,\nThen n - m + m - n = -1\nand m is less that p - p / 23\nor m = (p - p)/24\nSo the total percentage of people who wait for a time less than p is\n(p - p)/23 * (p - p)/(24 - 1) = <<p-p/(24-1)>=1/23\nSo the final answer would be 1/23 or 4%\n\nInput:The two farmers George and Sam bought 2170 lbs and 2330 l", "answer": "E: read book"}

(Note: In Ireland, 1 cup = half a liter.)\nOutput: In Ireland, 5 liter is equal to 1 gallon and 1 gallon=0.45 liters.\nSo if a cup is 0.225 liters, one gallon is equal to 5*0.225=<<0.225*5=11.25>>11.25 cups.\nSince 1 cup is equal to half a liter, 11.25/2=<<11.25//2=5.625>>5.625 cups are equal to 1 gallons.\nSo if the volume of coffee/tea/etc per day is 3.75 gallons, the amount of liquid used each day is equal to 5.625 gallons/7=<<5.625*7=39.5>>39.5 cups.\nSo the final amount of liquid used each can be calculated by (39.5/2)*3=<<39.5//2*3=19>>19.5 cups\nIf there are 19.5 cu of drink used per day, the total volume of drink used after 365 days = (19.5/2)=<<19.5//2=9.75>>9.75 gallons\nAfter 10 years, there will be ((9.75+1)*10=<<9.75+5=63.5>>63.5) cups of drink in total.\nSo the final number of gallons of drink after 10 years = 63.5 gallons\nYou can calculate the number of cups this will equal by (63.5", "answer": "C: small group"}

The student will keep on reading the numbers as long as they read a number that is two numbers away from the last number the other students read.  For example, if the last number they read was 57, they will have to keep reading the numbers as long the next number they choose to read is either 55 or 59.  If they can not read the next number after the last number they read, then they have to guess what number was chosen.  The students have ten attempts to guess the number correctly.  After each attempt, they each read a number.  The first student to guess the number reads it out loud, and then each of the other players have the chance to read a number.  If the player guessed the number correctly, then the first player wins.  If the player did not guess the number, then the same student reads again the next number.  For the ten attempts, the first student gets to read the 5th, 10th and 15th numbers, and the next student reads the 1st, 4th, 7th, 11th, and 16th numbers.

The largest digit in \"2_4_6_7_9\" would be 9.  This is because in base 10, 2_4_6 is equal to 6.  In order to convert 2_4_3 to base 10 you would simply add the digits (2+4+3+1).  5+1 = 6  thus 2_43 is 6.  In base 10, we simply add the decimal places at the end.\nSince 6+1 = 7, 9-3 = 6, 7-6 = 1, 4-3 = 1, and a 1 digit number, 4-7 = 0(1).\nThus 2_4_4_7_9 can be rearranged to 24079.

After ten people ate the candy bars, there were still five left. The next night there was only one bar left and it was eaten by a woman. There were two men, three women, and four children that ate the candy bar before the last one was eaten. How did you figure out there were 100 and 128 candy bars and who ate the last one?\nOutput: From the information given, it is not specified in relation to the number of days so we assume it is exactly one hour. The next part we calculate is how many pieces were taken per person, in other words, if there are 128 candies then each person took 1/128 pieces, so 100 / 128 = <>1/128=> 0.8. Now we calculate how many candybars were given to each person, this is calculated by dividing the candies left by the total of 100, so 5 / 100 * 0.8 = <>5/100*0.8=> 0.4 candy bars for each person.\n\nFrom that we have to calculate how many candies there were left after each person took, to do this we subtract each person\u2019s share from the total number of candes, so if the total number of candys were 100 then the first candy should share (5/128) so we substract that, so 5/128 \u2013 1 = 4/128. To repeat that process for the second person, we have to divide the 4 by 0.8, so it is (4/128)/.8 = 5/100.\n\nRepeating this process for the third person, we have to share out (5/100) times 0.8", "answer": "B: mall"}

The third from last car in the train has a broken brake and can't be used. The first train car has 4 seats. The second train car has 8 seats in it (6 in the back and 2 in front). The third from last and last car in the train have 7 seats each, and can only be used by people who sit in the cars. How many people can sit in the train cars?\nOutput: We start by checking the first train car. The first train car can seat <<4+3=7>>7 passengers.\nWe need to find how many passengers can sit in the last train car which contains 7 seats. If a person sitting in the last car has not been given a seat for sure, then that means an additional spot has been freed up where now another passenger can sit in the back seat in the last train car. If each passenger in the last train car is given a seat, they cannot have one person give a seat to the passenger behind them. All passengers sitting in the last train car can go to the first car and sit there. This can be represented by a binary tree (see diagram below). If we label each node in the tree with the number of seats in the corresponding car, then, in this case, 4, 6, 3, 3 and 7 can be seen as the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth train cars.  The total number of nodes in the train is 5. Let\u2019s add up the total number of seats in each node. The first train car is the root of the tree. The 4 + 3 = 7 passengers sitting in the car are counted each time we make a recursive call to the subproblem until we reach the fifth train car which is the recursive (sub)problem\u2019s base case.", "answer": "C: progress"}

She can buy as many buttons as necessary to buy her dress because the price of each button is less than $2.50 so her dress can be of any size. If at the mall, Mallory sees 60 dresses with a total of 1200 buttons, how many total buttons does she actually need to buy?\nOutput:\n1200 / 20 = << 1200/20=60>> 60 dresses\n60 dresses have a total of 20 buttons x 1200 /(60 x 20)= 12000 / 24 = <<12000/24=500>> 500 buttons she needs\nSince the cost of each button is less that $2.50 she can buy all the total buttons she needs\nSo the final answer\n  > 500\n\nInput:\"I'll pay that cash register in exact increments\" is the most accurate translation from one language to another in this story.

You can then use that times the seconds to figure out how many years it takes to see all the movies.\nThe first movie, Star Wars Part VI, takes up the first 3 days, which are 24,998,000 seconds total. So that time is 86,416 seconds. Each movie after takes (86,415 x #of days, where 86,423 is the next movie after Star Wars). Then we add that times the timespan between each movie.

To convert P free throws (with x being the free throw percentage) to 1 free throw, we use the recurrence x = 2x - 1 so (2x-1) = 2 and x = 1, in which case, x = 1, or the free throw percentage is 1, or that if every time a technical fowl occurs in a game, 2 free throws are also attempted and a player can convert 1 in 1 free throw.\nThe number of shots taken = 2 * P * (1-P)\nThe sum of all of them will be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4... + P\n(2P*P) + (2P * (1-P)) +... + 1 = 1 so the final answer should be 2\n\nInputs:There is a magic hat that has two sides.

What is the lowest number of coins that can be removed from the jar so that there will be an odd amount of change if there are exactly $6 in coins?\nOutput: Remove a dime and keep a nickel and there can be no more dimes in the jar.\nRemove a quarter and keep a nickel or dime and there is no more quarters in the jar.\nThe first time a nickel can be removed, they remove the leftmost coin until they have reached the minimum amount of change required.\nTherefore the leftmost coin can be removed 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7 times.\nSince this is based on removing odd-shaped coins, removing these coins will leave 3 odd coins in the jar but they will all be of the same type (5 of them) so they need to be removed altogether.\nThus from this they start over, and from step 3 they remove the first coin from the odd group and from step 1 they take the leftmost until they get to the minimum amount of change.\nSince we are taking dimes from the jar, that leaves 3 even coins and there are no nickels left in the jar. Therefore they can take a nickel which leaves 2 even coins and only one kind of coin left.\nThe last coin that was removed can only be a quarter so they can leave that coin and get an odd amount of change. Since there can be no more quarters left, they start over at step 3 with three quarters still left in the jar.\nAs they are taking 1 dime for 5 quarters, this is the largest amount of even coins so this is the", "answer": "E: car"}

(Assumptions: 1. He buys what he decided to buy first. 2. What he takes will always be a multiple of $4)\nOutput: As much as $39 dollars.\nDue to our assumptions we know that he can take only $22 dollars atmost, which means he can buy from $25 (original price-0.15*25) to $4 dollars atmost. But to have only $20 to give as change, we have to buy items whose value is some multiple of $4. But in both his previous and new combinations he takes the same amount of candy, so whatever he takes in the future has to be equal to some multiple of the candy he just took (but equal to $25 or less). Let this be $x. Thus, $x*(1- 2/5) * (1+2/5) = $<<1/5x*(1+2/5)=8/5>>8/5, $x=8/5. But then $x>22, so it's a contradiction.

Input data will include the expression to evaluate plus an output string that will contain the value of the expression. The value should be exact to 1 decimal point. In the event of a fraction, the denominator should be returned separately as a non-printing string (no quotes).\nOutput: The expression should return a double value that is converted to a single string value of the expression to indicate that the expression was executed and a value returned. The value will include a single quote in front of each expression and two decimal places in order to indicate that the value was rounded to the two decimal points.\nFor example 1\\2+3/2+2.2+2/2 should evaluate to 2.2, with the value outputted as \"1/2+3/2-2.2+2-2/2\". Also, in the case of fractions, the denominator should remain as a string without any quotes. For example, input \"3\\5+4\\12-3\\16+5\\16\" should evaluate to 6.50000001 and return the value as \"3/5+4/12-3/16+5/16\".

Based on the birds\u2019 appearances, what is the probability that he has correctly matched species?\nOutput: It is given that there is a 99.7 % probability that the two birds that he has observed is correct.\nSo it should be assumed that the 1.8 % probability of error that there were two different species of birds in the forest is negligible.\nSo we can assume that the one bird he has observed has the characteristics that he has observed it, and it should be assumed that it would have those characteristics in any other place too.\nSo it should have a gray head and orange-red streaks in the chest as it was there when he observed it, and also it has a brown head and gray streaks on the beak as it was also there when he observed the bird.\nSo it meets the definition of finch in the bird book it was listed in.\nSo there is a 98.2 % chance that the bird he observed is the exact type of bird, and that one observation was by accident.\nSo the chance that the correct birds are exactly the type of bird he assumes them to be is 98.2 %.\nSo the answer is A: 98.2%\n\nInput:Sarah's parents gave her 12 books, six of which were novels, and seven of which were children's books.

Since the 3PM bus is after both the 11AM and 1PM stops for the bus, the bus cannot travel on the middle to end road either.\nSince the bus can travel on only one path to the station, the bus has to take the 5PM to end journey, and that must use the road on the middle to end route.\nSo the final way the bus arrived was from the middle to end road\n\nInput: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, and Eddie each want to buy a toaster.

WUSA and F have the same number of players (P), for the World Cup. A WUSA team that participates in the Women's World cup will be eliminated if it loses a game or draws two games. P(w-cup winner) is the probability that the WUSA team that participated in the Women's cup soccer tournament will win. If there is only time for one game, and the United States has the maximum number of players (N max) allowed out of country, then how many of these women are expected to return home?\nOutput: In order to find P(w-cup wins), we substitute for N. The number of women who will be eliminated N = P(w-cup loses or w-draw 2).\nIn order to find P(draw 2), we substitute for N and P(draw) = 1 - P(w-draw). Then P(draw) = \"1 - P(l)\" is the probability of drawing. P(draw) = P(w-draw) = \"(1 - P(l)) * l = (1 - P(l) l = (1 -.05 *.2).\nNow we use Bayes' Theorem P(w- draw) = \"((1 - P(l)).\nP(w-winner) = P(w - draw) * P(w-winner).\nP(w- lost) is the probability of losing. P(w-lost) = 0.5 - P(w-win).\nSo,\nP(w-lost) / P(w- winner) is 0.5,\n(P(w-lost). / P(w- lost)) - (1 -.07)/.4) = 0.04\nSince they have the maximum number of women allowed P(w- draw), P(l) and P(w-lost).

{"idx": 501, "text": "Let S denote the number of sunburnt people and V the number of vegetarian people.   We know that S + V >= 5,   but S >= V + 4 (since you need to have 2 vegetarians as a minimum)   So S >= 9 - V, which is equivalent to   3 - V >= S   Taking logs, we find that log( V ) - log(3) + log(9) >= log(S) and simplifying by comparing logs to get linear equations, we find that (V -3)/9 >= S/log(S).   Since S is less than 11 and greater than 0, S lies between 1/3 and 1, so we can simplify this to 3 >= S and 9 < V. Since V is less than 10, this simplifies to 3 >= S >= 9.   To answer the question, we know that S is less than 3 and V is greater than 9, so V is more than 9 - S.  V is more than 3 since S >= 9, and V is also more than 9 which it originally was.\nSo the final answers are A: belief in god, B: vegetarianism, C: gain wealth, and D and E: all the above\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------Solutions by the Program-------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\ninput: 16 \noutput: 9 \nint c = 16;\nwhile(c!= 0) {\n    int mod = c%10;\n    c=(c-mod*10)/10;\n}\n\nprint(c);\n \n \n input: 28\n output: 6\nint[] c = new int[2];\n        c[0] = 28;\n            for(int i = 1;i < c.length; i++){\n                    int mod = c[i-1]%10;\n                    c[i] = c[i-i] + mod;\n            }\nfor(int i = c.length-1; i >= 0 ; i--){\n    System.out.println(c[i] + \" \");\n}\n\n \n \n \n\n---------------------------------------------------------", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

Two of the dogs are named Spotty and Rosy and they're both Poodles.  The last three dogs are named Rover, Tinker Bell and Squeaky Piggy.  What kind of dog is Squeaky Piggys sister?\nOutput:If Squeaky Pigs is a female and the last three dogs are Rover, Tinky Bell, and Squeaky we know that the last three dogs are of the opposite sex from each other.  If they are also Poodles then it is possible that they are a Triplet group but we do not know that the groups were identical so we cannot rule that out.  So our first assumption is that Poodles are Tinky Bell's sister and Tinky Bell'ssister is Squeaky so that makes Poodles Rosy's sister.\nNext we need to know if Poodles has a sister named Spotty which we have not been given and so it is possible for her to be either her sister or her daughter.  But again, since we do not know if they are identical it is possible that their children are both of opposite sex and we could not rule out a Triplet group.  Thus, it is also possible that Rover is the daughter of Poodles, in this case Poodles has a daughter named Rosy which does not have a daughter named Spotty, and so it is possible that Spotty is Rosy's sister, the two Poodle and Tinky Bell sisters each have a Spotty.\nSo, the final answer is: it is possible for the last three dogs to be a sibling group and the group being identical so the last three dogs could be a Triplet group with Spotty being Rosys sister making her Squeaky Pigger'ssister.\n\nInput:", "answer": "C: listening to music"}

English class is therefore done in 23 X 1/2 = 11.5 minutes.\nSince there are X classes between English class and lunch break, the time to finish all the classes is X * 11.5.\nFinally, the number of hours X should be is: 11.5 / 11.5 = 1.\nIt means X = 21 \u2013 13 = 8 hours\nSince there are 4 \u2013 1 = 3 classes after each lunch break, the number of hours after the lunch break is 3 * X = 24 hours.\nThere are 6 classes after lunch break, therefore 24 / 6 = 4 hours until the end of classes.\nTherefore, the 5th class after the lunch break should be one that takes Y hours, 8-Y = 8 hours being the number of hours to the end of the class which is 2 hours.\nSubstituting Y = 6, it can be said that the 5th class is English class, therefore, the number of hours Y can be said to be", "answer": "B: movies"}

The last time she purchased an odd number of cranberries, she spent $3.42. How many cranberries did she purchase?\nOutput: Rosie's last purchase was an odd amount of cranberries.\nRosie spends $3.42 to buy $<<3.42>>cranberries. She then buys $2*2*$<<2*2=>>8>>8 for $16, and $8*2*$<<2*(2)>>>16+8=>>44>16>>44 for $16.

We can then also conclude that at $5, she gets 2 cranberries for each dollar she spent on them. And thus, $10 would equal $2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 cranberries.

This question is based on the rule that there are 6 possible answers and you need to find the rule that makes the sentence true. So all you can do is think about what are the 6 possible words and make them relate to the question. (You will then discover that she doesn't mind the smell of water, she just thinks she doesn't like the smells of sprays on her face).\nSo for a start I thought of six words and wrote them down on a sheet. To get the smell of water we need to think of the other words that have water in them. (Pick some words and write them down with the first one, then write the correct answer for them at the end)\nExample: fountain, well, spray, swamp, pond, puddle, mud, pool, water, lake\nIf we look at the other 6 words they all have some kind of water word in them,  but only a few have the actual word swamp, but not spray so we need to eliminate spray. To do this I'm just going to cross that one off our list.\nPond, lake: water pond lake are all places we can find water\nWell: a well to me is a big thing of water where there is no lake or pond, so for this we cross that one off.\nIf we then look at fountain, it can mean any of the above but we can also have a fountain (sp) so water spray which we can use for the other answer for fountain, so we can cross it of.\nSo the question is which two words can you have which don't have each others word at the end so to do that we should put each one on each side of the word and see which two can't fit. So for swamp we have swam,p,o. So with sp we can cross p off and with swamp we can cross sp off. So with these answers we can't have spray so A,B,C can't be chosen.\nThe next word that we can put on each side is air which contains air. So with air we", "answer": "A: perfume"}

We show appreciation.\nSo the final selected answer is D\n\n## Hints\n\nThis solution contains over 50 pages and over 100 lines of code.\n\n### Section 1\n\nThis section will help you to understand what we mean when we say that a variable is a scalar type.\n\nWhat is a scalar type in programming?\n\nScalar types are types of variables that only hold one value. For example, strings are scalar types that can store one word.\n\n### Example\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s create a variable called variableA that holds an integer value:\n\n```python\nvariableA = 2\n```\n\nIf I were to add the number stored inside variableA with the number stored inside variableB, all I\u2019d see is the number from variable A. This is because a variable of type int (int stands for integer) can only hold one value at a time.\n\nIf we were to change the type of what we store into a variable, for example changing variableA to a string, then a new problem occurs. We can no longer add like this because now the type stored is not an integer and therefore this operation can no longer be performed.\n\n### String Type\n\nThe string type stores a string, or a sequence of characters. Strings are useful because we use them to label and organize data. \n\n### Example 01\n\nIf I was given a name and last surname string and we were to ask how many characters each string has, we might start by counting every character separately (there are 16 letters in the alphabet, hence we\u2019d have 26):\n\n```python\nname = \"Sandy\"\nsurname = \"Parker\"\n```\n\n```python\nimport time\ntime.sleep(8)\nprint(\"Name \" + name)\ntime.sleep(5)\nprint(\"Surnan \" + surname)\n```\n\n```\nName Sandy\nSurnan Parker\n```\n\n### Example - Adding and Subtracting\nAs another point, if we were to add name and surname we might first write the individual values like so:\n\n```python \nname =", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}

But we are given 5 choices and asked to choose one out of those 5 choices. The options are supermarket, water, cellar, soup, and grocery store:\nA) Supermarket is something that sells things. In this case, supermarket sells things, including food. Therefore, the meal is food-based, therefore it has to be salt and pepper.\nB) Water is not something that you cook food in. Therefore, it's not a type of liquid because liquid is an ingredient. Therefore, the food isn't water-based. Thus, this is false.\nC) This is not a type of liquid. You do not cook things in it. It's also not an ingredient because if it's a liquid, it is an ingredient, so it's false.\nD) This would have to be cellar. If it's soup-based, the meal has to be water-based. Furthermore, they don't mention that it's vegetables, so all types of soups can be made from meat. In addition, the meal is water-based, so it has to be either cellar or water.\nE) Since meals are water-based, grocery store cannot be the correct answer. It cannot be soup-based because a) they specify that if the food is water-based, it's either cellar or water and b) if the food is water, the answer cannot be cellar. We are left with grocery store or water, but the question is worded so that it implies that cellar is chosen so the correct answer in this case is water.", "answer": "D: soup"}

Therefore E is the correct option.  Therefore, the right answer is D.\n \n Input: If 6 people volunteer to give food to others, then we take the sum of the 6 people by adding all the 6 people, we get 6.\nWe can make addition rules like 2 x 6 = 12; 2 x 7 = 14 (we take the whole number); If there are 10 people, then the total of 10 is = 10; 2 x 10 = 20; and so on.\nWe can even take sum of a number of digits using addition rules and then sum it will give us the total. It will work for all, if we make this rule of 2 digit number. We just multiply digit with digit and sum it. If we have 10 and we are multiplying 2 by 10, we get 20. We repeat this rule for any number of digits.\nLet us take 6 digit number n. Now we multiply 2 by 6 and we will get 2 x 6 x 6... x 6 = (2 x 6)6\nHence n = (2 x 10)5 = 100000.

A plane, flying at a constant height at 4000m, is flying at 7000m above the ground. What is the temperature when this flight is taking place?\nOutput: Since the temperature is between -50\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C:\n-50\u00b0C < -50\u00b0C + 4000 + 7000 < 50\u00b0C\n-50\u00b0 < -50\u00b0 + b <= 50\u00b0\n-17800 + 11000 <= 50\u00b0C.\nSince the plane is flying, there is a constant height of 4000.

The houses are in a straight line from one end of town to the other. Which houses would you visit with the following bus schedule: Bus A goes to first house then comes back, then goes to second house, then goes to third house Bus B goes to second house, leaves, then comes back, then leaves, then comes back again When would the buses be available? Choices: A: When Bus A leaves house #2 and Bus B leaves house #1. B: When Bus A leaves on its first trip. C: When Bus A leaves, but Bus B does not yet leave. D: When Bus A leaves Bus B leaves and Bus A returns for the second time E: When Bus B leaves But not before Bus A leaves its second house.\nOutput: When a bus leaves house #1 and the other bus is still there, you can assume that on the next time the bus returns, it goes to the second house. If you think about it, the bus cannot come back if it leaves, so you can assume when Bus A is at house #2, if the bus doesn\u2019t leave, then it must return to house #1 after picking up at house #1. Thus, this doesn\u2019t matter. If you are on Bus B and Bus A also returns after Bus B leaves, then Bus B would leave after Bus A returns back. Thus, the first answer you should choose is choice C. The second answer you should choose is E, but you should have chosen the second answer already when you choose the first answer.

How many pounds of chips are in the bag?\nOutput: If 2/3 of the fat in the bag is 2/3*18% = <<2/3*15%=6>>6 % potato then by mass the potato is 18% - 6% = (18% - 15%) = <<18%-15%=3%>>3 % potato.\nIf there is 18% of potato is 1 lb of potato so the bag is 2 lb of potato.\nThe rest of the chips (1-2/3 = <<1-2/3=1/3>>1/3) of the bag is ~10% = 1/10. So there is ~1 lb + ~1/10 (lb of chips) = ~7/10 lb in the bag.\nIf the bag of chips contains 7/10 lb of chips then the 7/10 of the bag is 7/10 * (1/3) = <<7/(10*3)=2/10>>2/10 pound of chips.\nSo the final 2/10 +(1-(2/5)) = 2 + 7/10 = 10/10 which equals 10 lb in the chips.\nTherefore the answer to how many pounds are in the bag is 10 lb\nSo the final answeris 10\n\n\n### Instruction:Solve the following inequality.\n\nInput: There is enough food for $23 people.

How is that possible?\nOutput: You need to subtract 70 - 69 = <<70-69=1>>1 from 70 to get 69\nSo the answer is 69 -1= <<69-1=68>>68\nSo the final answer in \"wind chill\" is 68\n\nInput: A bag contains 7 green candies and 2 red candies.

Moreover, the sum of a and b is 21 and a >= 2. This implies that either a = 2 or 4. The only possibility that meets all this criteria is when a = 4 or 8, and b = 2, or b = 4. Thus, there are two possible combinations: 4+2 and 8+2.\nSo the final answers are 4+2 and8+2\n\nInput: Let c = 3. Let the number of unique ways to arrange a = b = 1 is a + b = 0.

{"idx": 816, "text": "You might try the internet for a quick answer, and many resources will cite the beavers\u2019 habitat as being a lush body of water, though there is more to the answer than that. \n\nThe beaver is considered to be the national and state mammal of the U.S.A.  That\u2019s a distinction it shares with the nutria, the gray whale, the prairie dog, the raccoon, and many others who hold similar titles.  The beaver\u2019s range is wide, reaching the North American continent as far south as central Mexico and as far north as Canada. Its range also includes Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  There are an estimated 39 million beavers in the U.S.  (This is the approximate population of beavers at the time of this writing.)  There are an estimated ten million beavers in Canada, too.  This means that, on average, there is about one beaver for every man, woman, and child in the U.S., which does not account for pets. For this reason, we can say the beavers\u2019 natural habitat is as varied as the people who share the land with it. \n\nAll around the world, humans have encroached on the animal\u2019s habitat. This is called habitat disturbance. As a result, many areas of beavers\u2019 habitat has been destroyed or damaged, causing the beavers to move to new areas. \nAn illustration of a river beaver ecosystem. \n\nBeavers are found in various settings, from deserts to mountains to ocean shorelines. Although there are numerous beaver habitats, these are considered prime: \n\nRivers: \nThis is where we find our beavers. They live in the water, not on land. They must, therefore, have access to water year-round. During the breeding season, male beavers have a larger territory and travel further from the home area. \n\nPonds: \nThese are shallow areas of water, similar to ditches.  The ponds are most often made by beavers. \n\nLakes: \nBeavers live on islands or along the shores of small lakes and larger lakes that are deep enough that the beavers can\u2019t build dams. \n\nLago", "answer": "B: body of water"}

At which position and time will the plane clear the tree at the bottom of the canyon? If the tree is standing at the bottom of the hill at an altitude of 50 ft, the equation of a plane is y = x^2 + 2.\nOutput: Consider the altitude of the plane = altitude + (speed * time) = altitude + (75/144) * t. The altitude after 10 seconds will be (y - 50) + ((75/145)*10) = (195 + (75*10)/145) = (199 + 0.515) = 51.15 ft above the tree.\nSo the final for that particular question is 51.815\n\nInput: An apple costs 50 cents per kilogram.

As a result, there is only a drop or two of liquid in our tanks at most. And that is why if we are in a plane we can't drink water for 3 hours. According to the speed of the plane, we can say that 3,000 miles per hour is the speed of the earth's water tanks. If the speed of the earth was the same as the plane, then it would take 3 hours to go through a tank of water. Since the speed of the earth is higher, according to the speed of the earth it take 3 hours for the earth to rotate. This results in a drop or two of water being in the earth tanks. So after the cup of water is filled, only a handful of people can drink water for 30 minutes and it will be consumed. This is why humans are allowed to drink 3 bottles after 2 bottles are finished. If the speed of coffee is 1000 miles per minute, then we can say that: 1000 m/h is the speed of the people on the earth who drink coffee at the same time. As a result, in 1 minute we have gone over 1 mile and, according to the speed at which the earth turns, we can say that in 1 minute it will take 1 mile for the earth to turn over.\n\nIn this way, if the speed of the earth were 100,000,00 m/h, then in 1 millisecond the earth will turn over.

How many apples can you eat every day during your stay?\nOutput: Since you have 2,709 calories to eat daily, and a total of 19 food items on the island. This could be written as calories per food / number of foods = <<calories per food/number of foods>>/19.\nLet the calories per can be the same of each food (in this example, it is 120 calories per can).\nTherefore, there should be 2,160 / 19 = <<2160/19=114>>114 cans of food per day, which can be calculated by finding the inverse of 114% of cans that is 114%, and taking 114% out of 100, or 1, which would then give 0.114.\nFrom there, multiply that number by 2, 114 cans / 2 = <<114/2=57>>57 cans.\nTo figure out total daily calories for the apple, take the 1 can of chocolate, divide that by 57 (since there are 57 cans a day), and that would give you 1 can of chocalate / 57 = <<1/57=49.680>>49.68% chocolate per can.\nHowever, 1 apple only has 180 calories.

If the last number is 21,500, then what is the number?\nOutput: The number is six times 1250 = <<6*1250=7500>>7500.\nSince the last number is 7500 and the first number was 20000, then the number of times the original number was multiplied by 16 would be 7500 \u00f7 2000 which is the last number that would give a remainder of 8 when multiplied by 11. Divide 7500 by 2000 to get 7.\nAdd two and then multiply by 10 to get 21,520.\nSo the number is 21520\nSo the final answer 21524\n\nInput: A 12-year-old child is 3x taller than his mother.

She says to leave in 10 min until I reach the bakery. She only has 4 sticks of bread. Which means I can pick up one sweet bread from another bakery 5 minutes away because there's only a half hour between the openings of the bakeries. Does this plan makes sense?\nOutput: My grandma is confused. Let the two bakeries be called A and B.\nMy grandma tells me to leave at 10 mins until I reach the bakeries. Thus, (A) I need to leave A at 10:10. Then, I only have 30 mins to reach Baker B. I can go to Baker B in less than 5 mins, since there's only a 30 min difference between the openings of Baker A and Baker B.\nHowever, my grandma says \"I can pick up one sweetbread from another bakery because there's only half an hour between the openings\" So if half an hour is between the openings of bakeries, then my grandma can wait for 18 mins until I reach bakery A.\nNow, we add up to the times: 18 mins + 25 mins + 10 mins = 53 mins, which is longer than 30 mins.

As I was leaving the house, I saw the dog peeing in my yard. As the dog drank the water, it was still taking a minute to fill its bladder. If the dog started peeing while I was pouring the water into my cups, then the next time I left the house, there would be a lot less water in my house. How much less water?\nOutput: Let T1 = <<T1>>the time taken for pouring the water into the mug\nLet T2 = <<T2>>the time taken for filling the dog's bladder\nIf the dog drinks water while pouring the water, then the water left in the tap = 1 - T2/T1 = T1*T2- T2\nSo, the water that remains in the tank will be 1 - <<1-T2/T1>>1*T2-T2\nIf there is T1 water left in the tank, the dog can drink all 100% water.\nSo, T1*T2 >1 which implies T2 < 1/T1 = T2< 1/240\nSo, T2 will be < 1/241\nSo, the final answer will be < 1 / 241\n\nInput: The first line of the input is the total number of cases, n, with n being a number less than 200.\nThen n lines follow each with x integer values \u200b\u200bof no more than 10 each.\nOutput: A single integer, the minimum average of all the inputs.\n\nInput: There is a town with 30 buildings, of which 7 are black, 8 are green, and 25 are brown.

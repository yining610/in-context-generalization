If your variable has both properties and methods then it is called an object in Python.\n\n### What are primitive and non-primitive data types?\n\nThere are two data types available in python: \n- Primitive Data Types\n- Non-Primitive Data Types\n\nPrimitive data types are the one which doesn\u2019t have their subtypes. Primtive data types will have some pre-defined values and one cannot change them once created as they are built-in.\n\nSome instances of the Primitive data types are:\n- int\n- float\n- str\n\nNon-Primitive data types are considered to be class, which means one can inherit and override them. One can easily use multiple instances of this data type and also make sure the user is not accessing the private and internal data of that object.\n\nSome instances that come under Non-Primitive data types:\n- Object\n- Array\n- Boolean\n- Class\n- Number\n- Tuple\n\n### Why would we define a class with the main() function as __name__ instead of __main__?\n\nOne of the most common mistakes that the developers generally make is to include __name__(main) in their scripts because they think that it will make it easy to use in the program. But unfortunately, it is not true and does nothing useful.\n\nBut there is one scenario that makes it mandatory or requires an execution environment to be called in a class. This is done because if the class object isn\u2019t instantiated, the execution would not continue.\n\nSo that\u2019s about it.

The formula is then `m= sum(a * d where a in a`\n\nThe second instruction, where we need to apply our formula is, where we want to obtain the result. The result, after multiplications can be found in the following way:\n`sum((n * d + (m -n)) for n in (a`\n\nThe third exercise, where we need to find the numbers with a different approach, namely by iteration. Since we want to know the number of hours, we start with the hour `1`. In each iteration, we add the hours with the amount of time `t=1`. We iterate `for (1 to i)`. The result is in the following way: for example:\n`hours[i] = hours[i] + t * 1h`\n\nThe fourth exercise, where the amount of goals and the total amount of goals depends on the two players with the highest amount of goals. Since we want to get the number of goals, we know the total amount of goals. We iterate over the two players with the most goals, we want to get the amount of goals of each of the two players. The result can be found in this way:\n`golds[i] = golds[i * 2] + golds[(i+1) * 2]`\n\nThe final exercise, where we have different options in a multiple choice, where we want to find the one with the correct option.", "answer": "C: repair shop"}

Multiple Choice Questions: Exercise 4.2\n\n### Question:\n\nWhat programming language should I learn next after Python?\n\n### Correct answer:\n\nC\n\nReason:\nFor most people, C is the next programming language after learning Python. But that is merely my opinion. There is no hard rule that requires one to choose between C and JavaScript, for instance, based on his/her previous programming experience with Python.  So, my answer is based on the programming experience of most Python programmers, and it\u2019s that they mostly choose C next.\n\nIf you like to learn more different programming languages, it will depend on your long-term goals.  The right next programming language should be selected based on:\n\n- 1. [The goal you want to achieve](https://github.php)\n- 2. [Your interests or favorite domain](https://github.python)\n\nFor instance, if you want to work on large scale web application, you should consider learning JavaScript or C++ (if you like Java).  If you are passionate in writing business applications with GUI interaction, you should learn VB or Java. If you want to apply some algorithms to work in AI, ML, etc, you should learn C#.\n\n***\n\n## Example: Exercise 5.1: Multiple Choice Questions\n\n#### [Answer](https://github.blogspot.com/Python-Programming/04.%09%20Multiple-Choice-Questions):\n\n*   Choice A: In Python, variables take the data type of a number or other data types.\n\n*   Choices B, D, but choice C is wrong.\n\n*   The correct answer is Choice A since no variable can be a letter in Python.\n\n***", "answer": "D: carry people"}

What other amount of coins can he put into the cup together with the nickel and the dime?  Choices:  C:1\n\n* Note: You can assume all values are integers and won't be negative or exceed\npositive integer limits.\n\n# Algorithm\nYou should approach this a problem-solving and algorithmically.\n\n## Approach 1 - Brute Force\nThis is going to be the most straight forward algorithm that you can put into code. You\nshould walk through each input case at most once.\n\n## Approch 2 - Hashing\nHashing is used because our input space is finite, and will not require you to iterate over it multiple times.  The goal is to iterate over the space to verify that the input is valid per the problem specifications.  In this problem, the inputs all fit to an integer value, which means that we can use a hash to check if the input is valid.  The input we get is the integer value which tells us whether we can accept it or not.\n\n## Approche 3 - Decision Tree\nA decision tree is an algorithm we use when we are given multiple inputs and only one final target output.  We determine which input has the highest value that leads to our desired target\noutput.  Each \"branch\" of this tree has multiple inputs but all of those inputs lead to only one final output.  What's interesting is that our inputs are very specific integers that lead us to a\ndesired outcome.  There are no other options that lead to different outcomes.  The branch\nthat leads only to one output is therefore our decision tree.\n\n## Approech 4 - Greedy\nA simple greedy algorithm says that the best possible choice is to choose the most\nconcentrated input as you go forward.  In this case, it is the biggest group of different fruits or nuts that leads to our goal.  Our goal is to maximize the group that gives us the least weight.\n\n# Implementation\n## Algorithm 1 - Brute force\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def solution(self, nuts, driedFruits):\n        priceNuts = 12\n        priceDF = 8", "answer": "B: grocery cart"}

You can also store the elements in another variable by the same name and print them, but I imagine you already figured that out.\n\n\nThe function, is not called within the body of the main() function, but rather as its own function, so you aren't actually calling it from within main(), but rather from outside it, for which any number of functions or values can be passed as inputs to the function.  The function function() is not being executed at all.  In general it is better practice to call functions like that from within another function, but since no input is required you can get away with calling it directly but I would recommend that you do not do so, as that may have confused you as well.\n\n\nIf you were to call it by main(), since the function has already been given a name and a definition, main() would have", "answer": "D: front porch"}

You just got to be careful about what you say. Sometimes people say the wrong thing. You have to think out loud but don't actually say the answer to the question. So if I were to say 400/50, obviously that's not going to be right.\n\nIt's actually pretty hard to get into a program though. I got rejected from every single program in the country after I graduated except for Apple. I didn't want to work an evil corporation like that. I wanted something more my style. After I graduated, I wanted to work at a place like the Wikimedia Foundation, which is the company behind the English Wikipedia. I worked there for 4.5 years. Then I applied somewhere else. I got rejected. I actually went to a place where I got multiple offers. I had 3 job offers so I had to pick one out. I did and now I work here at Google, which is pretty awesome. People here have very nice salaries and benefits. They're given very nice cafeterias. You could probably eat there if you wanted. Some people take a short commute. You've got the free laundry machines and the dry cleaning machine you can drop things off and pick it up when your own clothes are ready.\n\nGoogle's a very high paying job. They're paying you quite well. It's a great company where there's lots of free food. They have all sorts of things here. The people are very friendly. But you have your choice of places to pick from, even though these places are kind of boring. You're not going to hear about anything super secret. But for me, I like boring. I like to work so hard all the time that's what I like to do. Then I work from home.", "answer": "C: desk"}

By looking at that previous solution, they can determine an algorithm to solve the same exercise, and copy that. \n\nAlso note that the first few exercises have been made to be identical for several reasons.  For exercises 0 to 7 inclusive, the solution is the same for that exercise and that exercise only (except for exercises 4 and 5, which are only identical at the lower end but not the upper since division was not discussed yet).  Since no code is the same at this point, copying a solution is impossible, so cheating was not", "answer": "B: city"}

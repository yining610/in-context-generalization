Good communication skills can solve the problem of the project plan being pushed back to the team and project managements.<n><n>My advise to future interns are to do something useful and stand out as a intern. It is obvious that there are lot of people on the internship and only a few can make a contribution that changes the company's direction and become a leader. However, these few interns with positive contribution will be remembered by company's management and future employees.

The solution in C does not follow the rules the question is asking. The question is asking us to assume that the three percentages will all add up to 100%, and then that if the left handers add up to a certain percentage then that must mean that the remaining people must add up to 110% in order to balance as a whole. There is no evidence or information in the problem as to why 110% is correct, and as a result you cannot assume this. The question is not testing your ability to balance equations but instead it is testing your ability to make logical calculations without any unnecessary assumptions.<n><n>Input: It is 10:45 and I’m just going to make one more mistake here and then I’ll leave.

The most obvious benefit of walking is the weight loss that occurs - people who exercise for a minimum of an hour a day burn an averag number of 400 calories!  In addition, many experts believe that walking is an excellent exercise for a lazy individual because it only requires low impact movements.  The weight loss alone is enough to motivate an addicted smoker or alcoholic to get up out of the chair and take a walk.  The endorphins released by walking have been found to have a similar effect on the body as endorphin-related drugs like Marijuana (Mary Jane), so walking can be highly addictive!!

If your variable has both properties and methods then it is called an object in Python.<n><n>### What are primitive and non-primitive data types?<n><n>There are two data types available in python: <n>- Primitive Data Types<n>- Non-Primitive Data Types<n><n>Primitive data types are the one which doesn’t have their subtypes. Primtive data types will have some pre-defined values and one cannot change them once created as they are built-in.<n><n>Some instances of the Primitive data types are:<n>- int<n>- float<n>- str<n><n>Non-Primitive data types are considered to be class, which means one can inherit and override them. One can easily use multiple instances of this data type and also make sure the user is not accessing the private and internal data of that object.<n><n>Some instances that come under Non-Primitive data types:<n>- Object<n>- Array<n>- Boolean<n>- Class<n>- Number<n>- Tuple<n><n>### Why would we define a class with the main() function as __name__ instead of __main__?<n><n>One of the most common mistakes that the developers generally make is to include __name__(main) in their scripts because they think that it will make it easy to use in the program. But unfortunately, it is not true and does nothing useful.<n><n>But there is one scenario that makes it mandatory or requires an execution environment to be called in a class. This is done because if the class object isn’t instantiated, the execution would not continue.<n><n>So that’s about it. We hope that you have learned many things from this article and were able to solve all of the questions provided here.<n>

The formula is then `m= sum(a * d where a in a`<n><n>The second instruction, where we need to apply our formula is, where we want to obtain the result. The result, after multiplications can be found in the following way:<n>`sum((n * d + (m -n)) for n in (a`<n><n>The third exercise, where we need to find the numbers with a different approach, namely by iteration. Since we want to know the number of hours, we start with the hour `1`. In each iteration, we add the hours with the amount of time `t=1`. We iterate `for (1 to i)`. The result is in the following way: for example:<n>`hours[i] = hours[i] + t * 1h`<n><n>The fourth exercise, where the amount of goals and the total amount of goals depends on the two players with the highest amount of goals. Since we want to get the number of goals, we know the total amount of goals. We iterate over the two players with the most goals, we want to get the amount of goals of each of the two players. The result can be found in this way:<n>`golds[i] = golds[i * 2] + golds[(i+1) * 2]`<n><n>The final exercise, where we have different options in a multiple choice, where we want to find the one with the correct option.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Multiple Choice Questions: Exercise 4.2<n><n>### Question:<n><n>What programming language should I learn next after Python?<n><n>### Correct answer:<n><n>C<n><n>Reason:<n>For most people, C is the next programming language after learning Python. But that is merely my opinion. There is no hard rule that requires one to choose between C and JavaScript, for instance, based on his/her previous programming experience with Python.  So, my answer is based on the programming experience of most Python programmers, and it’s that they mostly choose C next.<n><n>If you like to learn more different programming languages, it will depend on your long-term goals.  The right next programming language should be selected based on:<n><n>- 1. [The goal you want to achieve](https://github.php)<n>- 2. [Your interests or favorite domain](https://github.python)<n><n>For instance, if you want to work on large scale web application, you should consider learning JavaScript or C++ (if you like Java).  If you are passionate in writing business applications with GUI interaction, you should learn VB or Java. If you want to apply some algorithms to work in AI, ML, etc, you should learn C#.<n><n>***<n><n>## Example: Exercise 5.1: Multiple Choice Questions<n><n>#### [Answer](https://github.blogspot.com/Python-Programming/04.%09%20Multiple-Choice-Questions):<n><n>*   Choice A: In Python, variables take the data type of a number or other data types.<n><n>*   Choices B, D, but choice C is wrong.<n><n>*   The correct answer is Choice A since no variable can be a letter in Python.<n><n>***<n>

You<n>should walk through each input case at most once.<n><n>## Approch 2 - Hashing<n>Hashing is used because our input space is finite, and will not require you to iterate over it multiple times.  The goal is to iterate over the space to verify that the input is valid per the problem specifications.  In this problem, the inputs all fit to an integer value, which means that we can use a hash to check if the input is valid.  The input we get is the integer value which tells us whether we can accept it or not.<n><n>## Approche 3 - Decision Tree<n>A decision tree is an algorithm we use when we are given multiple inputs and only one final target output.  We determine which input has the highest value that leads to our desired target<n>output.  Each "branch" of this tree has multiple inputs but all of those inputs lead to only one final output.  What's interesting is that our inputs are very specific integers that lead us to a<n>desired outcome.  There are no other options that lead to different outcomes.  The branch<n>that leads only to one output is therefore our decision tree.<n><n>## Approech 4 - Greedy<n>A simple greedy algorithm says that the best possible choice is to choose the most<n>concentrated input as you go forward.  In this case, it is the biggest group of different fruits or nuts that leads to our goal.  Our goal is to maximize the group that gives us the least weight.<n><n># Implementation<n>## Algorithm 1 - Brute force<n>```python<n>class Solution:<n>    def solution(self, nuts, driedFruits):<n>        priceNuts = 12<n>        priceDF = 8<n>        <n>

You can also store the elements in another variable by the same name and print them, but I imagine you already figured that out.<n><n><n>The function, is not called within the body of the main() function, but rather as its own function, so you aren't actually calling it from within main(), but rather from outside it, for which any number of functions or values can be passed as inputs to the function.  The function function() is not being executed at all.  In general it is better practice to call functions like that from within another function, but since no input is required you can get away with calling it directly but I would recommend that you do not do so, as that may have confused you as well.<n><n><n>If you were to call it by main(), since the function has already been given a name and a definition, main() would have

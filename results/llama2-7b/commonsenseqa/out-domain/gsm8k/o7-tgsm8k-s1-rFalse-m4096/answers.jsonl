The archaeologists record each artifact in a two part number. The lower part of the two part number represents the item's rank. The rankings start with the artifact found at the highest point on the site and continue consecutively from that point to the point where the artifact was found. The ranks are not associated with the artifacts. For example, it is possible that artifacts 35 and 37 have the same rank. The upper part of the number is the artifact's identifier. The identifiers, beginning with 1, are created so that any combination of artifact identifiers uniquely identifies one artifact. For example, if each artifact had a 2 in its upper part, 1, 2, 3,... would represent all of the items in consecutive order. There was a fire in the museum and part of the catalog.

For our problem it will be 42 x 3.6 = 156.04 square meters. We can then add the height to the formula to receive area 42 x 15.604 = 635.44 square meters.\nBecause we already solved for the area, we know we now have a rectangle of dimension", "answer": "D: fruit cocktail"}

Unfortunately, John has to work harder when it comes to this task because that's the only way he can be known as a reliable officer in the force.\n\nHis main task being that of patrolling around the city, John has been putting his focus on speeding people. That's why he is always trying to detect people for that. During these patrols he has noticed that two-third of the total patrollers in the force are speeding people while driving the cars and trucks.

The offices are usually located in one corner of the city. They have to drive at normal speed and slow speed for the traffic in the city, which sometimes can take time. During these patrol checks they find officers to be speeding their cars which is not advisable.

It was compiled by a group of people who understood of what they knew but, to them, were uncertain of what they didn'to' know about 1 + 2. This was written by a writer who had knowledge of the knowledge of these people. He also had knowledge of these people's knowledge of his own knowledge. He had no knowledge of himself, not even of what he didn'to' know. The author was writing the book in an uncertain way because it was written by another author who had knowledge of the same people as the one who had compiled the previous chapter that he wanted it to sound like he was writing to his friend who was illiterate. The writer would then write like it was just a poem just to get the message across. It was actually a poem. He was writing to a friend to talk about how he was feeling. He was talking about his friends. He was talking about he and his friend. It had no meaning at all for anybody but him.

This worked fine for the first few of the problems, but I wanted to create a general algorithm to solve this problem. I created dictionaries to store the variables I need. The first part of the code is checking the dictionary the data. I used the len of each dictionary to count the amount of data I had so I can move on to the next part. I have an if statement to check if the data matches the data. If it does, it returns the answer to the problem. The if statement only works for the answer for the fourth question. The last part of the while loop just prints the answer and a check saying if the problem had 0 answers. The code has been written in a pseudocode style and there are some minor details that I could fix.

From that very large room, there are two doors and a very large window to the right, and then there are two other large doors to the left. There are 15 small rooms of the mansion which you can go through. You can choose to go to any of these 25 rooms, except the small rooms in between the doors of the big room, and the small room at the end of the foyer. You can also choose not to go through any door at all. You can only walk through one doorway at a time, and then you have no choice until you have returned to the big room.  In each room, your choices will be represented by a letter, and on each doorway, there will be a different letter. When you enter a room, the letter that represents the entrance is removed. The idea is that by the end of the day, you have managed to get out of all these rooms except one.  However, there is a catch: if you go through the doorway that represents the letter you use, you will magically time-travel to a moment about to happen in the future, wherein, you will see how the day has been happening. But in the end, you will return back to the place you are, right now. For example, if in the past, the future is, and the letter \"A\" is used, you will see the doors change when you come out. So if the \"A\" represents a door, that door will be an empty space and no doorway there. As a warning to you, there is some danger involved in this, when we take a moment to explain. When you enter a building, when you enter a room, when you enter a doorway to another room that has the same letter as you will use, you will see what happens in the future. It is possible to die in these events. If you do die, you immediately go back to the moment where you entered the building, room, or doorway that you were just in. You have no choice but to live your life over and over as many times as necessary until you make it out of the maze.  You also see future events. You only see future events if you were to go through that doorway in the maze, and it is not always the case that you could possibly die", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

For a collection of integers (m), the element with the highest frequency is first sorted into its own bucket, which has buckets for each unique value that could be found in our collection of m integers (we have m-1 buckets). After the element is stored into its own bucket, we move onto sorting all other elements of the collection that are less frequent. Each element is first divided equally into two buckets. The bucket with the larger amount is removed, and the amount of elements in the bucket with the lesser amount is incremented by that amount. When we reach the point in which no bucket has any elements in it, we have successfully completed the sort; this solution works in both asc", "answer": "C: large city"}

{"idx": 9, "text": "A\n#### 34. The following is a code-switching question involving the use of \"to\" (don't forget to add other rules for this type of questions).\n\nCode:   In 1982, a group of Japanese researchers observed a large number of penguins in the Antarctic. But they noticed that some of the penguins could swim farther than others. After a three-year investigation they identified some peculiar birds that they thought were capable of crossing from one side of the island to the other. The researchers put out some fish that the birds wanted to eat, and they also put out some large rocks. Which words did the penguins use most often with the rocks to express the distances they swam:   - many kilometers and many miles?  - several kilometers and several miles?    - a long way and a great distance?    \nInput: They should look at a map and then answer.  \n\nTips: Answer is the first one.\n\n1. They should look at a simple map.\n\n-  ( )\n\n2. The island is a small one and the penguins are not on a regular route to swim to the mainland every day. They can swim to the other side of the island only a few times a week in a good weather. So they didn't swim very often and the words they used in their conversations with this rocks were usually words of length, not words of distance. So the distances they swam couldn't be expressed in miles or kilometers.\n\n- \n3.  To cross from one side of the Antarctic island to the other, some penguins swim for 500 meters and some swim for 1500 meters.\n\n-  But 1000 meters and 1500 miles are not equivalent in meaning in the penguin's minds.\n\n-  These penguins live in Antarctica. There are no regular routes from one side of the ocean to the other. These penguins can swim to the main continent only a few times a year in good weather. So the distances or length of swims they had to do would have seemed very long.\n\n-  For these penguins, 400 and 800 kilometers are not equivalent.\n\n4. So the", "answer": "E: blotter"}

At the start of each round, each hand is displayed with its stones in either a horizontal or vertical orientation. Each stone may be turned so that all of its edges are vertical.  When a player starts a new round, he must turn one stone in his hand so that one of its edges is vertical. His opponent must then choose to turn one of his three stones so that one horizontal edge is vertical. Both players then turn their own stones so that at least one of their stones has a vertical edge.  The player who is more successful with his stone turns wins a point. However, if any stones fall because of a stoned being turned, both players lose one point.  Players turn their stones until one player gains three points and wins the level.

She uses 3 large stickers each on the front page of their journals and 7 stickers per page to 6 other pages. How many stickers remain?  \n- I first looked at the number of how many sticker pages were left after using 19 stickers.  The answer 46 and therefore the question would be why is Mary using those stickers on the front pages of their journals.  The answer then would be the sticker page would then be 0 or 1 page because the answer is 46 after the 80 minus 3 plus 7 is 46.  Since this is not correct, I have to then think about how many stickers are in total in any given journal given she has 80 stickers in all.  This is because she used 3 for the front page of their journal and 7 for each page of their journal leaving them with 46 left stickers and 4 pages of their journal.  If you have 46 total and 4 pages on each journal this would then be 11.5 average stickers per journal page.  The answer would then be 82 on each journal for 20 stickers or 82-20=62 stickers left.\n\n### Input Zach is saving his money for a brand new bike. He is getting paid $5 a week.

They wanted to make sure that customers could get their money back even if the tire did not work in an amount of time equivalent to the length of the guarantee.  There were a number of problems with this program that needed to be worked out, such as the number and types of tires that would be sold. The first problem was to determine the number of tires that had to be sold so that the dealership had the maximum likely payout at any point in the first two years. Consider the first year of sales, when tires had the $300 guarantee.  Tires are sold on a sliding scale, with the price per tire decreasing by $0.25 per each of the first six months. After that, there is no price for the rest of the year. The price per tire in the second year increases by $100 if the number of tires sold last year exceeded the first year total. In the second year, tires sold have a $0 guarantee, while tires sold in the first year are guaranteed for $300. Find the price of the tires if the price must remain constant for the entire duration of the two-year sales period.  The price for the tires at the beginning of the second year must be at least the minimum price that can be achieved for the first year, minus any costs incurred by selling the tires. The minimum price for the first year will be 55 + (66-50)2 = 4", "answer": "E: toy store"}

The cost of a taxi from your house to the airport is $20.  The average taxi fare from the airport to your house is $25.  You are trying to save money, so how far do you need to drive from the airport so that, on average, the cost of riding from the airport equals the cost of driving?\nOutput: First, the taxi ride from the airport to the house is going to be about $20.\nThen, once you get to the airport, you want the round trip to be the same as the average round trip.  Then, the taxi rate should divide the price on the way to the airport to the price of the on the way home.\nThus, the average of the rate for each leg of the trip should be:\n(20 + 25)/2 = 22 + 25/2 = <<22+25/2=227>>227\nSo, in order for the taxi price to equal the driving price (227), you want the driving distance from the airport to be double:\n20+20+25\n\nBut, when you drive from the airport to reach your destination, you are going to get charged as if you were going back to the airport:\n25+25\n\nSo, we have a function of:\n5  + 5/2\n\nIncrease by 5/2, in order to be equal to the trip, would be driving 5/2 more miles, doubling the distance, bringing it to:\nIn the end, you would want to do x-1 = 1, since the only change you might need to go to the airport is if you are there to catch another flight.\nThe solution is:\nSo the final answer would be D\n\nInput: In a city, the roads run perpendicular to each other meaning that every road runs exactly as straight as possible.

If the person is a male, he has more than 50% red hair. If the person is female, he has more than half of the red hairs.\nOutput: If you put the question in terms of the percentage, it\u2019s easy to see the answer. If more than 50%, it\u2019s male. If the person is male, in a sense, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s more than half or not, because it\u2019s still going to be more than 50. So it must be true that if the person is female, (much) more than half (of the individual strands of hair) must be red. (And again, we could use the term (much) greater than to express the same thing as (much) more.) As a result, we would say that the person is female and that more than half of her hair is red. Thus, either more than half of a sample is always true or it\u2019s not. It would be more difficult to determine if it\u2019s less than half; however, either half of the sample is greater than or equal to an equal amount in the total sample, or it\u2019s not equal. Both of these options have to be true. If we determine we\u2019re talking about 3 things, a and b. If we determine that b is less than a and c, we\u2019re saying that a is more than b, which is true for both cases, so either c has to be less than a. Therefore, if we determine that c is less than a, it follows that b is less than c for both cases. Now, we\u2019ve established that for a less than the total amount, for both c and b, but we can only say c is less than a if c is also less than b.\n\n#### Challenge\nInput: A family of", "answer": "B: names"}

There aren\u2019t enough chairs at the party, so at most two people will get to sit together. Find the probability that if someone randomly picks a chair, he or she can sit with a friend.\nOutput: Let x be the number of people sitting together.\nWe know that if a person is randomly chosen to sit with a friend, x = 2.\nAlso, we know that if a person arrives to the party, they will always sit in a pair, which means x = 3.\nTherefore, the probability will be 1/ (1+3) = <<1/1+3=1/4>>1/4.\nHowever, we don\u2019t want to work with fractions, so we will divide 1/4 by 4 and get our probability to 1/16 or 5/128.\nSo we divide 1/16 by 0.5, which gives us 1 or 0.05.\nA 0.05 probability is pretty close to 5%, so close we could round two people sitting together to 10% and one to 5%\nso 10%x 5% = 1% for two people to sit together to a 10% probability.\n\nInput: In a city, there is a hospital, a university, many shopping centers, and a museum dedicated to natural heritage.

If however you give your key to a neighbor to store their mail in your box that can be a huge problem. In this scenario the public box would be in a community mailbox unit.  Here there are a series of large lock boxes attached to the outside of the post office box for your box.  In this scenario if one neighbor moves in that does not share the key, then your mail box is still not secure but a neighbor could pick up your mail. A: A communal box does not lock nor does anyone check for signatures.  You are allowed to be the one to check your box.  This is no safer than any other mail box location.  The mail has to come off the truck and be delivered to this mail box.  The mail carrier would not have time to check inside.  B. When you buy a comm box you have a key that you can use to check the box in order to get the mail.  At the end of the day mail that has been received would be placed in this box.  When the next day begins the mail carrier would retrieve this box and move to the next neighborhood.\nWhen you are home the mail is usually delivered by noon.  By 11 there is no reason to have the box up at their delivery station.  There is no one there to get it off the truck", "answer": "E: mail box"}

Since their parents died in an avalanche, Mia, Rik, Tina, and their mom's friend Nola have started a nonprofit to help other children who have lost their parents.

The siblings decided to spend three days traveling, visiting their camp location, and meeting donors.  They had $1200 to spend on travel and donor lunches, with each sibling getting half.  How long could each of them go out and buy lunch at a nearby restaurant?\nOutput: Since there are three siblings, and each person gets half for 3 days, this is 3 days times 12 siblings. The children have 1200 dollars to spend and they need 200 dollars for each kid, so 1200/200 dollars per child = <<1200/1200=10>>10 children per child. Since these children go out to eat 3 days for each kid this comes out to 30 children = <<30+1=31>>31 children. This number of children times 4 = <<30*4=120>>2 *2 = 60 dollars per restaurant. $1200 dollars divided by 60 dollars per night equals <<1200/(120*1)=10>>10 lunches per night.\nSo the final number of lunches per child is 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15\nSo the final answer for lunches is 15", "answer": "A: feeling refreshed"}

One monkey, after being selected by a random number generator, is given a typewriter. How fast will the monkey be able to type the complete works of William Shakespeare?\nOutput: Let us have N monkeys. There are an infinite number so that the number of monkey is defined as infinity.\nSo from now on each monkey will print 1 word for the monkey house if the number of monkeys is less than infinity.\n1 word is 26 letters and the first letter of William Shakespeare is W.\nSo we add 26 to W and we get SW. So SW is the first word.\nSo we continue iterating n monkeys and we get SW.SW.SW...SW..SW. The SW stands for William Shakespeare.\nSo from now we can say we have 26 letters and 1 word from each monkey.\nLet's calculate using time. W(SW) is our initial monkey. If you want to print N monkeys, you need 2*N time.\nThe first monkey needs to print 1*26 letters and 26 letters is the whole alphabet's word.\nSo it takes 1 time to have each monkey.\nIn total it takes 1 time and N monkeys.\nLet's substitute N.\n1*1=<<1*1=1>>1\n1*10=<<1*10=10>>10\n1*100=<<1*200=200>>200\n1*1,000,000=<<10,000,100,00=1,100,101>>1,100\nSo the monkey house can print one time the complete works of William Shakespear, 1 words long.\nSo the final number of letters required is 1,100 and each letter has 26.\nSo the final letters are 1,102,629.696\nSo the final answer can be an arbitrary 20 digits", "answer": "D: neighbor's house"}

When they first made their plans, they calculated that they needed 3000 British Pounds for Daisy's flights.  However, they discovered that the rate of conversion had changed to 505 British Pounds per American dollar.  To convert Dori's funds to American dollars, what was the final conversion rate needed to pay for Dori's and Daisy's entire trip to London?\nOutput: Daisy and Jori both need 3000 pounds to travel to London.\nThen the exchange rate is 505->505/<<5505/5505=10>>10.\nSo 10*5505 = <<10*55505=<<5505000=275>>55050.\nSo Jori needs 275 pounds to travel.\nDori needs 2700/<<275*27>>2700 pounds to travel.\nSo the final conversion rate needed is <<555/5500=<<55500/5500000=100>>100.\nSo the answer is that Dori needs 100 pounds.\n\nInput:Mrs. Puff's school for sea pupils is in need of a new dock.

For those who answered 4, you calculated the 40 hours spent in 1 week = 6 days.  Now, multiply those 6 days by 2 weeks to get the second number that needs to be multiplied (because there are two weeks of car washing in a month).  If the answer is not 120, you are closer to the correct answer.  9 hours is the correct answer.\nOutput: You must consider how many hours in a month are devoted to car washing. 20 days * 8 hours = 160 hours per month. If 9 hours in a day are spent on car washing, 6 more days would have to be devoted to car washing in a single month.  (2 weeks + 2 weeks) * 8 = 120 hours per month.\nThe question asks for the number of hours spent on car washing PER MONTH, which means the car wash takes 120/8=<<120/8 = 15>>15 hours per month.

It was established in the 1790s as the distance a lightning bolt travels during the time it takes light to travel approximately 104 meters. The unit of measurement for height is feet/inches(ft.in). Each foot is equal to 12 inches, so 5 feet would mean 5 x 12 inches = 60 inches. One foot equals 12 inches.  One inch equals 1/1440th of a meter.\nSo the answer should be:1/144,000, or 1/10,000 of a meter).

For this, we have time divided by completed problems.\nTo get the number of problems he finishes every hour, we can just take the total time, which the student says is 2.2h, and subtract the average time it takes to solve 2 problems, which is 1.1h, so the total time would be $<<2.2-1.1=1.1>>1.1h.\nNow, if they did the same number of problems each hour, then it would just be 1.1 hours, so 2*1.1 is <<2*1.1=2.2>>2.2 completed problems.\nI don't think the answer wants us to do that though. The second part also says that it takes him 1.1 hours to solve 2 problems.

What is the minimum price that a car dealer must charge in order to sell (at least) 600 cars each month?\nOutput: Suppose he is willing to sell cars at any price. His revenues are $X$. Then, his cost is (5/6)^ (X/1000). This is the profit he obtains (5/6)^(X-1000)/1000.\nFrom this figure, he can see if at least 600 cars were sold each month. We require that profits $>=450,000. This requires that X $\\geq$ (5/6)^((450000-1000) *1000)/[(5/6)^(1000)]\nX $\\geq$ (5^0.8)/(5^0.8) = (5^0.2)/(1/5^0.2) $\\geq$ 1000/1000 = 1.\nFrom that, we need: X $\\geq$ (450001)/(5^0).\nThus, we require: X $\\geq$ 87685 / (5^0) = 87686.\nThis will only happen at X=87686 / (5^0).\nRearranging yields: X=87631.2000 = 87631\nSo our final answer is 8763.12000\n\nInput:-2/x = -1\nSubtracting from both sides.\nx = 1/2\nSo the final answers were A\n\nInput:-2*x = -3\nMultiplying both sides.\n2*x = - (3+2)\n2*x = 3/1-1", "answer": "C: isolation"}

(there are no students who got a score lower than 500)\nOutput: First, let a be the number that doesn\u2019t appear.\na*1435 = <<a*1434=207>>207\nThen b is the number that is divisible by a but not 207. Thus 207-b = 1435. So 207 = <<207=2>>2.\nWe know b = 2. So b*1435/2=<<b*1435/(2*2)=217>>217.\nThen c is the number whose gcd with a = 1. Hence, 1 = a*c.\nThen c = <<c=17>>17 \nNow we know a, b, and c.

How many women were there at the reunion?\nOutput: There were 58 alum at the reunion and all ages over 45 and all exept 2 over 55.  To determine the possible remaining values for either two of these groups, a common difference method can be used.\nIf the two remaining variables are x and y, to calculate all possible combinations for x and y to be in either two of these three groups, we can start by subtracting 24 from all of the ages except for two. The first group will still have 24 in it.  So this first group will have values of 6, 12, and 18. The second group will have values of  20, 26, 32, and 40.  To determine values for x and y, these three groups can be multiplied by 24 and added together to determine the number of possible combinations. For the first group, 6 times 24 = 144. For the second group, 12 times 24 =  288. Lastly, 18 times 24 = $<<18*24=432>>432\nThe first group has a total of 676 possible combinations to include the six common values: 6, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42.

For example, a dog cannot own a human or use a human body.\nThe difference between a dog and a robot is that: dogs have animal rights but robots don\u2019t have animal rights, so bots can be used or owned like humans.\nIf a robot is owned by another robot, it also means that the robot has no rights, but humans will still have rights. So, if a robot is owned by a robot, a human can abuse a robot. In the future, robots will be treated to be like slaves.", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

{"idx": 938, "text": "We could describe a crowd of 400 as \"alone\".  So this is the answer.\nInput: At the 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary, Hillary Clinton lost to Bernie Sanders by 22,000 votes cast in the Democratic primary.  Donald Trump won the Republican primary by 15,000 votes.  The margin of victory is the percentage of votes won by the winner minus the percentage of votes lost by the primary runner-up. For instance Bernie Sanders received 49.4% of the vote and Donald Trump received 55.4%.  Bernie therefore lost 6.0% while Donald Trump gained 6.0% of the vote.  Thus Bernie lost 6.0-6.0% = ||6.0%-6.0%= 0.0%==> 0% while Trump gained 6. 0%.   Given the primary margins of victory, determine what percentage, if any, of the New Hampshire primary vote went to Libertarian candidates.\nOutput: Assuming only Sanders and Trump ran and 40% of voters supported Trump, then 100%-6.3% = <<6.3%-1>> 43.7% went to libertarian.\nInput: I have 50 pounds of chocolate in a box.

What was the actual total number of students in the kindergarten class in 2007?\nOutput: Since a class grows by 0.5%, we need 100.5% of class growth to get the total number of students in 2008. Then we apply this class growth for 2008 to 2007. To do this, multiply 100.3/104% to determine the class growth in 2009. Apply this new class growth (100.3%) to the number of students in 1987 (104% of 2007 number). Do this process five additional times (101.3%, 102.3%, 111.3%, 300.3% and 400.3%) until 105% is achieved in 2002.

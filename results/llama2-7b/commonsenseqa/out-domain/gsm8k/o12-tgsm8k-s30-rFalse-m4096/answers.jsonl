So, in order to find the total weight of the carrots she will need to sum up 55 + 101 + 78 = 232.  The total weight of the carrot she pulled out = 232 x 6 = 1372.  So, Kelly pulled out 1372 pounds of carrots.\n\n#### Expananation:\n\nThere will be 3 friends left since 4 friends dropped out = 7 - 4 = 3 friends.  So, the remaining share, after paying 2/5, is 25/5 = 5.  Also, the remaining amount is $120 less which gives us 120 - 120 = 0.  So, they were each required to pay 0 dollars, or, in words, 0/0 or free.\n\n#### Exanplanation:\n\n435 is divisible by 8.  450 divided by 2 yields 225 so it gets split among 4, in this case.

This is very useful because we can then work with those sub-solutions in a recursive way that allows us to quickly calculate new sub-problem values and solve the problem in a more efficient way.\n\n### Step 1: Recall that the question is asking for how much money did Jennie spent for rental for 11 days or we can interpret this as we are given days and need to calculate the expense for those days.\n\n### We can calculate the expense on 14 days and then we can use that expense  for finding Expense for 11 days which is the sub-problem\n### So we need to find a DP function named expansive_cost\n\ndef expansive_cost (days):\n    # Your code here\n     if days>=11:\n        return days*30\n     elif days>=7:\n        return (days-6)*30 + 30*1\n     else:\n        return days*(10-days)*30 +100\n\n### Step2: \n#### Input the first day to the function and then iterate till it reaches to expense for 14 days\n   for i in range(0,4):\n        print(i, expansive_cost(i))\n          \n### After that we need to iterate the first problem to calculate expens of 14 days\n\n#### Expense for 1 day:    \nexpense2 =expansive_cost(1)\nprint(\"Expense for 1 day\", expense2)\n\n#### Expense  for 2 days:\n    expense_1 =expansive_ cost(1)\n    expense_2 =expansive(2)\n    expense =expense_2 + expense_1\n    print(\"Expense for 2 days\", expense)\n### In this way we are calculating\n### Expense for 14days \nexpense_ = expansive_cost()\n\n### The final answer is 310\n### Exp", "answer": "C: understand themselves"}

It is 9:20 am. The bus will arrive in 30 minutes, leaving you with 20 minutes until you can board.\nYour next bus is a 30-minute bus, so in 20 minutes it must arrive to fit within your timeline.\nA car drives past you every 30 minutes.\nThe bus arrives. The car takes 1 minute and 23 seconds to pass, so the bus passes you at 9:52 am.\nHow did you know that the bus would arrive on the dot?\n\nHint\nYou look at the traffic light for the intersection where the bus stop is located.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Solution\nThe time on the traffic light is not synchronized with the time on your watch so you can easily determine what time it is.  Therefore, all vehicles which should be passing have done so and the time is right when the bus arrives.\nIf we assume that all vehicles make it through an intersection in 30 minutes no matter what: The time on the traffic light could be 45 minutes and even 50 minutes and it may not represent local time but time of a faraway station.

The value, x, will be given as a separate argument to the nested function. x will be a string with a single digit, that is 0 through 9.  The argument passed to the nested function should look like 'x_str'. Once in the nested function, the x, that started as a string with a single letter, should be converted to an integer and the value should be printed with the letter 'x' in front of it. The nested function must be defined inside an outer function, and return a string with the value printed inside the nested function. After printing the string, it needs to be returned to the caller of the outer function. The outer function must print out the string 'Output: x_str.' plus the returned value.  The letter 'x' and the return value should be capitalized inside the nested function.The letters on the right side of the double equal character, in the inner function, that do not end in a digit, should now be capitalized.

The output represents how many dollars Jennie spent.\n\nThe first step is to compute the number of 11 day periods in 60 days.  By dividing two fractions, in this case 60 and 11 (11/11 = 1), the result is 5. Thus, we can say that there are 5 11 day periods. Jennie pays $30 per 11 day period. Since there are 5 periods, the total cost is $150.\n\n# ------------------------ #\n\n2. How much time will it take to drive all 400 cattle?\n\nTo find how much time it will take to drive all 20 cows one way it is necessary to know that time will be equal to distance divided by speed.\n\nSince the distance is 60 miles to and from the truck, the total distance is 120 miles. And since the speed is 60 miles per 120 miles we get that 60/60 = 1 and this means that it will take 1 hour and 15 minutes to drive all the cows one way.\n\nThe same process works for the next question.\n\n# ------------ #\n\n3. What does the expression 60% mean?\n\nIt means that the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. 5/3 = 66%\n\n# ------ #\n\n4. How much more, in dollars, does each boy receive in compensation?\n\nThe difference between 51300 and 52700 is $1400, which we can write using a mixed number: 1400/200 = 7.

So once I figured that equation might be something like $N*X = Y*k$ where $N is the number of total people in the room, $X$ the number of people with a birthday this year and $Y$ the number of people for every birthday in the room, and $k$ being the total number of birthdays in the room. However this solution did not make sense as when it asked for the number of people coming for Iris' birthday party the answer was not $36$. I then came to the conclusion where if all people in the room were present then this equation would be true. This way I could calculate how many people in a group with a birthday and in a group not with a birthday. I then calculated how many people would be with a birthday in the room and then the total of the number of people present with a birthday and not with a birthday and subtracted it from the total number of people that were present. I then calculated how much birthdays there were in the room (4, since it was iris' and the number of people from her family that was going to be present on Iris' birthday) and added back in half that plus 1 since it was iris. So my solution was the total number of people in the group.", "answer": "D: school together"}

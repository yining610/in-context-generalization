The menu included a beef stew the daughter had asked for, a salad of lemon, tomatoes, greens, and celery she made from the family's garden, and her mother's favorite, potato salad. For the beef stew, the daughter was careful to chop the onions into the pot for cooking and saved the scraps for the soup. After the feast, and with the house clean, she went into the kitchen to make the stew. On the way, she needed to pass the laundry room, which she stopped to do because tomorrow they have to return some of the dishes they borrowed from their next door neighbors. All the kitchen utensils are stored in the drawer above the stove. She found a box that holds her mother's chicken soup recipe. After sorting through all this, she is able to make the beef stew. But while making her mom's chicken soup, she discovered that they didn't have a large cooking pot. As she was returning to the stove to make the beef and onion stew, she found a casserole dish, and that is the only thing she used to make stew. Now all they have to do is make salad with what's left. In order to make the salad, the daughter goes into the walk-in closet in the garage to take clothes and fold them together to hang.

While it's always fun to come up with questions like this, they are more difficult to find answers for than a good math problem.  If you want some ideas on how to find solutions for these types of issues though, just take a look at the list below: \"Where can I find the best answer possible?\", \"What resources do I have at my disposal that I can use to find an answer?\" and \"What does this mean to me and my family/friends who may need help?\"\nCan robots ask questions? - Yes!

{"idx": 853, "text": "B\n```\n\n\n\nIn this problem, I took some liberties in how to interpret \"share\" a cost that was 20% off. But this is an easy problem.\n\nIn this problem there are a couple of strange things going on..\nFirst, it gives the \"total\" amount that Melissa drives in a year. This isn't really helpful or possible.\n\nSecond, it says that each of the boys $300. So how does this play out when they split it up? $500 is over. So there is still 175$ left to go. I think this means 175$ but that's $461.25 / 2\n\nI think this question can be solved but the problem is with the words \"total bill is for\". I can't interpret the word \"for\" here. Does \"for\" mean you divide everything up evenly or does it mean whatever bill is left over, that's for the ambulance. If the bill is over then the ambulance ride may not cost anything at all. You can't really tell here. I would have to use trial and error to figure which of this 2 methods they use.\n\n\n\nIt kind of makes no sense that each person only got an 8lb portion. It's like some mysterious 9lb was hidden in the third bed.\n\nThe last question here doesn't really make sense. They're a party of 23. How could they be 6 over on guests?\n\n\n\nThis question has a strange problem regarding \"equal\" and \"$3900 to split\". That part doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.\n\nI like this question..\nSeveral people are coming to the party for sure because Iris.\n\n```python\ndef total_expense(number_of_candidates):\n    number_of_people = number_of_candidate\n\n    if number_of_candiate % 2 == 0: \n        return number_of_people\n    else:\n        return number_people /2\n```\n\nThis is a simple problem.

How many people who walk to work ride a bus to work?\nOutput: 9.339161536\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFinally, \n\n```\nprint(\"My solution:\")\nfor r in range(1, total_questions):\n    print(instructions[i])\n    if questions[i].is_numeric_question():\n        continue\n    print(r.\". \".r.r.answer_question(multiple_choice_questions[i], question[i], correct_answer, partial_answers[i], number_of_sub_questions[i]))\n```\n\nThis program is inefficient, as you can see we will have to run for loop for each question, in a way for which a recursive solution would be better. We will have to use for loop, as multiple questions asks for the same amount of correct answers no matter how many questions there are. So we will have to just pass in the number of correct answers and make use of if statement.", "answer": "C: office"}
